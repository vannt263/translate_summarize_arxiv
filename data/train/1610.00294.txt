    "these ices account for up to 60 and 80% of the volatile oxygen and carbon budget in star forming regions respectively @xcite . of the three major ice constituents ,",
    "this study focuses on co@xmath0 .",
    "co@xmath0 is an important ice component during all stages of star formation .",
    "co@xmath0 ice has been observed in dense clouds @xcite , protostellar envelopes @xcite and in comets @xcite , the remnants of the solar nebula . in this range of environments , co@xmath0 abundances with respect to water",
    "is surprisingly constant at 2030% .",
    "interstellar and cometary co@xmath0 identifications as well as column density determinations rely on infrared spectroscopy .",
    "co@xmath0 ice has two ir active fundamental modes : the 4.27 @xmath1 stretch ( @xmath2 ) and the 15.2 @xmath1 bending ( @xmath3 ) modes , both of which have been identified in ices observationally .",
    "furthermore , co@xmath0 ice spectra have been shown to depend sensitively on the local ice environment .",
    "the 15.2 @xmath4 m band displays a characteristic davydov splitting in the pure crystalline phase .",
    "amorphous co@xmath0 ice and co@xmath0 in ice mixtures do not show this splitting , and the band is typically shifted with respect to the pure ice band position .",
    "the frequency and shape of the co@xmath0 @xmath2 stretch also depend on the bulk ice structure .",
    "several studies have pointed out that the band displays a low frequency shoulder at 2328 @xmath5 ( 4.30 @xmath4 m ) in pure amorphous co@xmath0 and in some co@xmath0 mixtures with hydrogen - bonding molecules @xcite .",
    "this environmental sensitivity has been used to identify several different co@xmath0 ice phases in observational spectra : in star forming regions , most co@xmath0 is typically mixed with water , but co : co@xmath0 and pure co@xmath0 ice phases are also common @xcite .",
    "co@xmath0 ice spectroscopy has also been used in the laboratory to trace co@xmath0 trapping , segregation and diffusion processes @xcite .",
    "in addition to the normal vibrational modes , co@xmath0 optical phonons , arising from long range collective vibrations in the solid , can be excited by infrared radiation .",
    "a phonon is a quantized vibrational motion in which the lattice atoms or molecules vibrate at a single frequency .",
    "optical phonons occur when the molecules are moving out of phase within the lattice .",
    "these phonons can propagate through thin films of astronomical dimension but can not travel through films of thickness much greater than the wavelength of incoming radiation .",
    "thick films will instead exhibit restrahalen bands in which the change in the refractive index results in a strong reflection .",
    "solid co@xmath0 exhibits both tranverse optical ( to ) and longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonons in which the normal vibrations propagate through the ice lattice perpendicular and parallel to the direction of the ir field respectively .",
    "when a thin film is positioned at an oblique angle to the incoming radiation , the electric field has components both parallel and perpendicular to the film normal and longitudinal optical phonons can be excited by the parallel component of the field vector .",
    "the angular dependent enhancement of the lo mode is known as the berreman effect after experiments conducted by berreman on the angular dependence of the lo mode in ionic crystals @xcite .",
    "the theory of optical phonon mode splitting has been described previously for polycrystalline films @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the splitting is estimated by :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the frequencies of the lo and to phonon modes , @xmath9 is the dielectric constant of the ice , _ m _ is the reduced mass associated with the coordinate _ q _ , _ v _ is the unit cell volume and @xmath10/@xmath11 is the transition dipole moment matrix element .    in many cases",

    "lo phonon modes are often invisible in laboratory ice spectra due to the common experimental setup in which the infrared beam is normal to the film surface .",
    "co@xmath0 lo - phonon modes have , however , been reported in reflection - absorption infrared spectroscopy ( rairs ) studies of ices , when the substrate is naturally positioned at a grazing angle to the ir beam .",
    "@xcite report rair spectra of co@xmath0 ices at 12 k and show that new modes appear using p - polarized light at 2377 and 676 @xmath5 .    @xcite have also observed co@xmath0 lo phonons in both transmission ir and rairs experiments .",

    "a closed cycle helium cryostat ( air products displex de 202 - 0sp expander and apd cryogenics hc-4 compressor ) was added to cool the ir transparent substrate , a 0.3 @xmath21 kbr pellet pressed into a tungsten grid that is suspended into the chamber by an ofhc copper coldfinger .",
    "the substrate is cooled to 28 k and the temperature is monitored using a k - type thermocouple welded to tantalum foil and attached to the w - grid close to the kbr pellet .",

    "the lo phonon mode disappears as the ice film is rotated such that its plane of incidence is parallel to the ir beam ( figure [ fig : anglesco2 ] ) .",

    "figure [ fig : spectra ] shows the effect of introducing co , o@xmath0 or h@xmath0o into the co@xmath0 ice lattice by mixing with co@xmath0 prior to deposition . increasing the fraction of the defect species in the co@xmath0 ice results in an increasing redshift of the lo phonon mode from the pure ice position .",
    "the right panels of figure [ fig : spectra ] present the @xmath7 redshift versus the fraction of each species in the co@xmath0 ice mixture .",
    "these plots display a positive linear correlation between the defect concentration and the lo redshift for each of the ice mixtures considered .",

    "in addition to shifting the frequency of the lo mode , the three mixing partners also affect the shape of the lo mode spectral band , and these spectral changes are species specific . in co mixtures with co@xmath0 , a second small peak appears in the spectra of mixtures with more than 30@xmath23 co. this peak is also redshifted from the pure lo phonon mode position but does not appear to shift with co concentration beyond 30% , possibly representing a stable mixing environment between co and co@xmath0 such as the formation of a complex .",
    "a similar second peak is present in all of the mixed o@xmath0:co@xmath0 ice spectra .",
    "the spectra of h@xmath0o mixtures with co@xmath0 differ from those of the co and o@xmath0 mixtures in several ways . in particular , the spectra of co@xmath0 in polar h@xmath0o environments show broadening of the @xmath2 mode as well as non - linear dependence of the @xmath2 frequency on the fraction of h@xmath0o in the ice .",
    "the co@xmath0 bending mode for the ice mixtures are shown in figure [ fig : v2 ] .",
    "the lo phonon mode is split from the @xmath32 mode at 660 @xmath5 by 17 @xmath5 , while the @xmath33 peak at 655 @xmath5 does not display appreciable lo / to splitting .",
    "the @xmath3 lo mode behaves similarly to the @xmath2 mode , with linear shifts that are dependent on the fractional abundance of the defect in the ice .",
    "the redshift is likewise the largest for co ice mixtures with respect to the ice fraction . both co and o@xmath0 ice mixtures display decreased davydov splitting of the @xmath3 band with respect to the pure co@xmath0 ices .",
    "the @xmath3 bands in h@xmath0o mixtures are broad and do not display davydov splitting , due to the effect of the hydrogen bonding network of the h@xmath0o lattice on the co@xmath0 crystal structure .",
    "the decrease of davydov splitting in the ice mixtures supports the fact that the co@xmath0 crystal structure is disrupted upon addition of the defect molecules as pairwise binding interactions between co@xmath0 and the introduced molecule can result in only one equivalent co@xmath0 per unit cell .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the davydov splitting continues to decrease in the ice mixtures with increasing concentration of co or o@xmath0 as more interactions become available in each unit cell .",
    "we also conducted experiments to measure the introduction of defects _ in situ _ by uv irradiation of pure co@xmath0 ices , which is known to produce co. figure [ fig : photo ] shows spectra of pure co@xmath0 ice irradiated with uv photons from a hydrogen discharge lamp for a period of 140 minutes .",
    "the co@xmath0 lo phonon mode clearly redshifts with exposure time .",
    "the redshift is linear with co photoproduct growth , similar to when a defect is introduced through pre - mixing .",
    "there are two differences in the lo phonon mode shifts in these experiments compared to the pre - mixed experiments , however .",
    "first , the lo phonon mode depends more steeply on co concentration in the ice with a linear fit of 54 @xmath27 6 @xmath5 n@xmath28/n@xmath29 compared to the pre - mixed case which gives a fit of 36 @xmath27 7 @xmath5 n@xmath28/n@xmath29 .",
    "second , the photolyzed phonon mode is split into the redshifted ( co : co@xmath0 mixture ) component and a second component that remains at the pure co@xmath0 lo phonon frequency .",
    "this suggests that some pure co@xmath0 is present throughout the photolysis experiment . to test whether this may be due to limited ly-@xmath34 penetration depth through the ice",
    ", we also photolysed a @xmath1910 nm think co@xmath0 ice while monitoring the lo phonon mode ; the penetration depth of 10.2 ev photons through co@xmath0 ice has been previously measured in our laboratory as 50 nm @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : photothin ] shows that photolysis of the thin ice also results in a split lo phonon mode , with one peak that can be ascribed to pure co@xmath0 and another to a co : co@xmath0 ice mixture , demonstrating that the second peak can not be due to a limited photon penetration depth .",
    "furthermore , the absorbance at the pure co@xmath0 phonon mode frequency ( 2381 @xmath5 ) plateaus after @xmath1920 minutes of irradiation , while the production of co and destruction of co@xmath0 remains linear through the irradiation period .",
    "the plateau at the pure co@xmath0 lo frequency thus indicates that an environment exists in the ice in which the co@xmath0 is not mixed with the photoproducts and this hypothesis is further discussed in section [ sec : effects ] .",
    "the lo - to splitting depends on long range dipole interactions between co@xmath0 molecules and therefore is perturbed by the addition of other species into the ice lattice .",
    "the magnitude of the lo - to splitting depends on the ice physical structure and bonding , the optical properties of the ice and the transition dipole moment of the co@xmath0 normal modes .",
    "thus , the lo redshift upon addition of co , h@xmath0o and o@xmath0 into the co@xmath0 ice lattice is a combination of how each of these species changes structure , binding energies , dielectric constant and transition moments of the co@xmath0 molecules within the lattice .    according to equation [ eq:1 ]",
    ", the transition dipole moment governs the lo - to splitting in polycrystalline films .",
    "the co@xmath0 asymmetric stretch has a large transition dipole matrix element , consistent with the large lo - to splitting in pure co@xmath0 ice .",
    "one might expect that differences in the redshifts of the co@xmath0 lo frequency correspond to differences in the effects of the transition dipole elements of co , h@xmath0o and o@xmath0 on that of the co@xmath0 lo mode .",
    "co , while exhibiting only a small dipole moment , has a very large transition dipole moment that could perturb the effective co@xmath0 transition element . while h@xmath0o has a large transition dipole ,",
    "o@xmath0 has @xmath4=0 for all internuclear separations and therefore its transition dipole moment is zero everywhere . if the changes in the co@xmath0 transition dipole moment were the only explanation for the lo redshift we would expect that o@xmath0 would not shift the lo frequency and that co and h@xmath0o would have similar lo redshifts , which is not the case in our measurements .",
    "we therefore consider other effects on the lo - to splitting .",
    "the addition of co , o@xmath0 and h@xmath0o affects the co@xmath0 ice physical structure .",
    "changes in the crystal structure can shift the lo mode to lower frequencies as shown for different co@xmath0 ice nanostructures @xcite .",
    "our data suggest that co has the greatest effect on the longitudinal phonon frequency in co@xmath0 ice . despite the substantially lower binding energy to co@xmath0 compared to h@xmath0o",
    ", co may produce the observed large shift because it is able fit well into the co@xmath0 ice lattice so that each co@xmath0 molecules in the lattice has dipole interactions with more co molecules than in the case of h@xmath0o ; however , detailed structural simulations are required to constrain the exact mechanism .",
    "splitting of the lo phonon into more than one band indicates that the mixing is not homogeneous and distinct co@xmath0 bulk environments are present in the ice .",
    "this may be caused by co@xmath0 segregation away from the defect ice component .",
    "figure [ fig : spectra ] shows splitting of the lo mode in the co@xmath0:o@xmath0 ice mixtures and in the co@xmath0:co mixtures with high co abundance . in the h@xmath0o mixtures ,",
    "the lo mode at the pure co@xmath0 frequency is absent , this suggests that the co@xmath0 is mixed in the h@xmath0o ice lattice such that pockets of pure co@xmath0 do not occur .",
    "this is expected as co@xmath0 diffusion through h@xmath0o is slow at 28 k @xcite while diffusion and segregation of co and o@xmath0 may be possible , though further experiments are needed to support this hypothesis .",
    "we see the clearest splitting of the lo mode in the photolysis of co@xmath0 ice , where one component stays at the pure co@xmath0 lo position .",
    "as demonstrated by the thin ice photolysis experiment , this is not due to shielding of the uv radiation for the deepest ice layers .",
    "instead , pockets of pure co@xmath0 must either be maintained or produced during the photolysis .",
    "only @xmath1920@xmath23 of the co@xmath0 ice is lost during the photolysis period .",
    "it is possible that some of the leftover co@xmath0 is not mixed with the photoproducts and maintained as pure co@xmath0 ice .",
    "pure co@xmath0 could also be produced during the photolysis by several mechanisms .",
    "excited co@xmath0 that is not photolysed carries excess energy that may allow it to segregate away from the photoproducts to form pure co@xmath0 pockets .",
    "co@xmath0 is also reformed during the photolysis by co + o recombination and co@xmath35 dissociation .",
    "another possible explanation is the desorption of photoproducts that are formed in the surface layers , leaving behind pure co@xmath0 .",
    "this hypothesis could be investigated further by studying the molecules desorbing from the ice during the photolysis , by using isotopically labeled layers or by capping the co@xmath0 ice with an inert gas matrix .",
    "the sensitivity of the co@xmath0 lo phonon mode to ice mixing may be utilized in laboratory studies to provide information on bulk diffusion , physical mixing properties and ice phase properties such as crystallization .",
    "we have shown that the lo mode is particularly sensitive to the addition of ice defect molecules added either by deposition of gas mixtures or _ in situ _ by photolysis of the ice . mixing",
    "may also occur through diffusion of molecules in the ice .",
    "diffusion is proposed to underpin much of the chemistry in interstellar ices , but diffusion barriers and mechanisms are highly uncertain @xcite .",
    "bulk diffusion may also regulate the morphology of interstellar ices .",
    "diffusion of co out of co@xmath0 ice may cause co distillation from co - rich ices protostellar regions , thus explaining the presence of pure co@xmath0 in some such lines of sight @xcite .",
    "we have conducted preliminary experiments to check whether the co@xmath0 lo mode could trace diffusion and desorption processes .",
    "the co@xmath0 ice mixtures were slowly heated passed the desorption temperature of co or o@xmath0 and the changes in lo mode were monitored .",
    "as the defect molecule desorbs , the lo phonon mode moves back toward the pure co@xmath0 frequency .",
    "the process is not completely reversible as some defect molecules remain trapped and desorb with the co@xmath0 ice around 75 k. this suggests that phonon mode spectroscopy could be used to characterize diffusion in co@xmath0 ices .",
    "furthermore , phonon modes are not unique to co@xmath0 ice , and optical phonons in other ices may be used to measure diffusion coefficients for a range of astronomically relevant species .    phonon mode monitoring may also be used to characterize ice crystallization .",
    "the lyddane - sachs - teller relationship ( equation [ eq:2 ] ) shows that the lo phonon mode should shift abruptly upon a phase change in the ice due to a rapid change in the static dielectric constant .",
    "optical phonons in ices may therefore provide a useful measure of crystallization kinetics .",
    "the observed lo - to splitting for ice deposited at different temperatures may be used to accurately deduce phase change temperatures and the corresponding index of refraction for ices around the phase change boundary .",
    "longitudinal optical phonon modes may contribute to interstellar ice spectra for several important ice constituents if light from the background source is sufficiently polarized . in laboratory reflection absorption",
    "spectra p - polarized light , parallel to the surface normal , can interact with longitudinal phonons in the ice . in astronomical environments",
    "longitudinal phonons can be excited by p - polarized light or by the component of the unpolarized light wave that is parallel to the surface normal . because the interstellar ices are not confined to slabs , as in the case of laboratory experiments , the fraction of p - polarization and s - polarization is generally equal for randomly orientated dust particles .",
    "unpolarized light will predominantly produce the to mode , though it can also excite lo phonons when the incoming ir wave is at oblique angles to the ice surface as seen in our laboratory spectra ( figure [ fig : anglesco2 ] ) .",
    "the best sources for observing longitudinal phonons in ices are therefore those with the highest linear polarization fraction .",
    "linear polarization arises from absorption and scattering from irregular dust grains which will absorb light from the background star preferentially along one axis .",
    "dust grains can align with a local magnetic field and produce elliptically polarized light with linear and circular components @xcite .",
    "the degree of linear polarization in star forming regions is often very large ranging from 20 - 70% and can extend over regions as large as 1 pc @xcite .",
    "a good source to characterize interstellar co@xmath0 lo phonon modes would be , for example iras 05329 - 0505 , for which @xcite measure the linear polarization fraction as 70% in the k@xmath36 band .",
    "optical phonon modes have been previously identified in laboratory spectra of h@xmath0o and co @xcite .",
    "water ice phonons are considered carriers of far infrared bands at 62 @xmath4 m ( longitudinal acoustic ) and 44 @xmath4 m ( transverse optical ) bands @xcite , which can be observed with far - ir telescopes such as sofia .",
    "these bands are sensitive to the ice structure with the 62 @xmath4 m appearing at the crystallization phase transition @xcite .",
    "spectra of co bearing ices in 39 ysos observed using the vlt have been fit using the optical phonon modes of @xmath34-co @xcite .",
    "here , the lo mode was able to accurately reproduce the blue wing of the co band for all of the observed sources .",
    "lo phonon modes thus needs to be taken into account when identifying the carriers of observed ice spectral features .    in the case of co@xmath0 ,",
    "identifying and characterizing the lo phonon mode in observed spectra could also provide important information about the ice composition , morphology and thermal history . because the lo phonon mode is sensitive to defects in the co@xmath0 ice lattice",
    ", its frequency can be used to provide information about abundance of other species mixed with solid co@xmath0 . in pristine co@xmath0 ice",
    "the lo mode will appear at 4.2 @xmath4 m , if light from the background source is sufficiently polarized . for co@xmath0 ice in apolar and polar phases",
    "the lo phonon mode would be present at a redshifted frequency that is dependent on the fractional abundance of other ice components .",
    "a lack of lo - to splitting in all ice species provides constraints on the source ( polarization and dust properties ) , while a lack of lo - to splitting in co@xmath0 when present in co would constrain the co@xmath0 ice to be dilute , in which case the lo mode is convoluted with the to mode .    to fit observational spectra , the co@xmath0 lo phonon spectra reported here need to be adjusted to account for grain size and shape effects .",
    "the standard method for treating grain shape and size variations has been to use a continuous distribution of ellipsoids ( cde ) ( e.g. @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "have shown that the size and shape of grains affect the co@xmath0 absorption profile causing typical shifts and broadenings of 5 @xmath5 that can dominate over variations due to ice matrix effects .",
    "an in depth analysis of grain geometric effects on the co@xmath0 lo phonon mode will be needed to before it can be used to constrain ice mixing in observational spectra .",
    "analysis of lo - to splitting should be especially fruitful on future ice spectra acquired with the jwst , since the analysis requires both high sensitivity and spectral resolution .",
    "we have shown that longitudinal optical phonons in co@xmath0 ices are particularly sensitive to the presence of other ice species in the lattice .",
    "the frequency of the co@xmath0 lo mode redshifts linearly as the concentration of the ice mixing molecule is increased .",
    "similarly , photolysis of co@xmath0 ices results in a linear redshift of the lo phonon mode with formation of the major photoproduct , co. these spectral signatures will be useful for constraining ice mixing both in laboratory experiments and in observations of astronomical ices .",
