    "the quantum hall effect @xcite is an anomaly that occurs in the transport properties of two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) in the regime of strong perpendicular magnetic fields . at certain magnetic fields",
    "it is found that the voltage drop in the system in the direction of current flow , which is responsible for dissipation , vanishes at low temperatures .",
    "our understanding of this transport anomaly is not absolutely complete , however there is fairly broad agreement that the effect can occur only when the electronic system has , in the absence of disorder , jumps in its chemical potential at certain densities ( @xmath0 ) , that depend on magnetic field . in section ii of these notes",
    "we specifically discuss the relationship between incompressibility and transport properties in a 2des .",
    "the remaining sections discuss two aspects of the physics of quantum hall systems that are direct consequences of this relationship .",
    "quantum hall systems can be ferromagnetic . under appropriate circumstances the spin - moments of the electrons align spontaneously , _",
    "i.e. _ in the absence of zeeman coupling to a magnetic field . we will refer to the 2des in this case as a quantum hall ferromagnet .",
    "quantum hall ferromagnets provide a particularly simple example of a two - dimensional itinerant electron ferromagnet , and therefore represent an attractive target for theories of the quantum statistical mechanics of such systems @xcite .",
    "they also have a number of interesting unique properties , the most striking of which is that their instantons carry an electronic charge .",
    "this property is an immediate consequence of _ incompressibility at a magnetic - field dependent density_. in section iii of these notes we discuss the electrically charged instantons of quantum hall ferromagnets and some of the observable consequences of their presence .",
    "another consequence of incompressibility at a magnetic field dependent density is that quantum hall systems _ necessarily _ have gapless excitations localized at their edges .",
    "the low - energy physics of quantum hall systems is therefore like that of a one - dimensional electron system which , because of time - reversal symmetry breaking by the magnetic field , can carry a current even in equilibrium . in section",
    "iv we will discuss the physics of quantum hall edges , including their description in terms of the luttinger liquid models appropriate to one - dimensional fermion systems .",
    "section v contains some concluding remarks .",
    "these notes do not attempt a systematic introduction to the physics of the quantum hall effect .",
    "interested readers can consult a previous effort of mine @xcite that is cited frequently below .",
    "if greater depth is desired , readers can consult one of the excellent books covering different aspects of the subject @xcite .",
    "i have written previously at this level but at greater length on quantum hall edge states @xcite ; parts of the present notes borrow from that text .",
    "the thermodynamic compressibility of a system of interacting particles is proportional to the derivative of the chemical potential with respect to density .",
    "it can happen that at zero temperature the chemical potential has a discontinuity at a density @xmath0 : the energy to add a particle to the system ( @xmath2 ) differs , at this density , from the energy to remove a particle from the system ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the system is then said to be incompressible . in an incompressible system",
    "a finite energy is required to create unbound positive and negative charges that are capable of carrying current through the bulk .",
    "the number of these free charges present in the system will have an activated temperature dependence and will vanish for @xmath4 .",
    "incompressible systems are usually insulating .",
    "paradoxically , as we explain below , incompressibility is precisely the condition required for the quantum hall effect to occur .",
    "the twist is that in the case of the quantum hall effect , the density @xmath0 at which the incompressibility occurs must depend on magnetic field . in my view , _ incompressibility at a magnetic - field - dependent density _ is the _ sine qua non _ of the quantum hall effect .    for non - interacting electrons , the single - particle energy spectrum of a 2des in a magnetic field consists of landau levels , separated by @xmath5 energy gaps and with a macroscopic degeneracy @xmath6 .",
    "( here @xmath7 is the magnetic field strength , @xmath8 is the magnetic flux quantum , @xmath9 is the area of the system , and @xmath10 is the electron mass . ) both the energy gaps between landau levels and the degeneracy of the landau levels are proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "chemical potential discontinuities occur whenever the density is an integral multiple of @xmath11 .",
    "we show below that this property requires the existence of the gapless edge excitations discussed in section iv .",
    "it is conventional in discussing the quantum hall effect to use a magnetic field dependent density unit by defining the landau level filling factor @xmath12 . for non - interacting electrons ,",
    "incompressibilities occur at integer filling factors .",
    "when interactions are included , incompressibilities can also occur at fractional filling factors and , as we will discuss , physical properties near integer filling factors can be qualitatively altered .",
    "the relationship between incompressibility and the transport anomalies that give the quantum hall effect its name can be understood by the following argument @xcite . consider a 2des at zero temperature , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ [ fig : incomp ] ] .",
    "we consider the case in which the chemical potential lies in the ` charge gap ' ; @xmath13 .",
    "we want to consider the change in the equilibrium local currents , present in the system because of the breaking of time - reversal - invariance by the magnetic field , when we make an infinitesimal change in the chemical potential , @xmath14 .",
    "because @xmath15 lies in the charge gap the change in the local current density anywhere in the bulk of the system must be zero .",
    "the current density can change , if it does anywhere , only at the edge of the system .",
    "it follows from charge conservation that , if there is a change in the current flowing along the edge of the system , it must be the same at any point along the edge .",
    "we can relate this change in current to the change in the orbital magnetization : @xmath16 eq .",
    "( [ eq : orbmag ] ) is just the equation for the magnetic moment of a current loop .",
    "however , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the number of electrons . ) the second equality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : maxwell ] ) follows from a maxwell relation . combining eq .",
    "( [ eq : orbmag ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : maxwell ] ) we obtain the following result for the rate at which the equilibrium edge current changes with chemical potential when the chemical potential lies in a charge gap : @xmath19 the fact that @xmath20 implies that whenever the charge gap occurs at a density that depends on magnetic field , there _ must _ be gapless excitations at the edge of the system .",
    "properties of these low - energy edge excitations are discussed in section iv .",
    "(  [ eq : streda ] ) is expected to apply to the edge states even when the chemical potential lies only in a mobility gap and not in a true gap , as illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ [ fig : incomp ] ] .",
    "a net current can be carried from source to drain across the system by changing the local chemical potentials only at the edges and having different chemical potentials along the two edges connecting source and drain . when bulk states are localized , the two edges and the bulk are effectively decoupled from each other .",
    "( [ eq : streda ] ) then also applies to transport currents , relating the current carried from source to drain to the chemical potential difference between the two edges , equal to @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the hall voltage .",
    "there is no voltage drop along an edge since each edge is in local equilibrium and hence no dissipation inside the sample .",
    "( [ eq : streda ] ) is commonly known as the steda - widom formula @xcite . in using this picture to explain transport experiments in bulk systems",
    "it is necessary to claim that the transport current will be carried entirely at the edge of the system even when bulk states occur at the fermi level , as long as these states are localized .",
    "there are difficulties with this argument as a complete explanation for all transport phenomena associated with the quantum hall effect , but that is another story and we will not pursue it here .",
    "the quantum hall regime is usually understood as the regime in which no qualitative change in physical properties results from mixing of landau levels by either interactions or disorder .",
    "it is common in theoretical studies to truncate the hilbert space to a single orbital landau level and include mixing , if at all , only when making quantitative estimates for comparison with experiment . the quantum hall regime ,",
    "then , assumes that the landau level separation , @xmath23 is larger than other energy scales of interest . on the other hand",
    "the ferromagnetic state is generally defined in terms of the properties of an electronic system in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "the term _ quantum hall ferromagnet _ appears to be an oxymoron . to understand why it is not only sensible but also of more than academic interest to add this category to our taxonomy of electronic states ,",
    "it is necessary to consider the relevant energy scales for the case of the semiconductor systems in which 2des s are realized . for a free - electron system in a magnetic field , the zeeman splitting of spin - levels @xmath24 and the landau level separation @xmath23 are identical , apart from small relativistic corrections .",
    "electrons in states near the conduction band minimum of a semiconductor behave like free electrons @xcite except that band effects renormalize the electron mass @xmath10 and the g - factor . in the case of the gaas systems , where the quantum hall effect is most often studied , band effects increase the landau level separation by a factor of @xmath25 and reduce the zeeman splitting by a factor of @xmath26 . as a result for typical experimental situations , the landau level separation ( in temperature units )",
    "is @xmath27 , and the characteristic scale for electron - electron interactions is @xmath28 while the zeeman splitting is only @xmath29 .",
    "we call a system a quantum hall ferromagnet if the electronic spins in the incompressible ground state with density @xmath0 align in the absence of zeeman coupling . in many cases ,",
    "the properties of a quantum hall ferromagnet with such a small zeeman coupling do not differ noticeably from the properties when the zeeman coupling is set to zero .",
    "in other cases , the small zeeman coupling plays an important role but it is still useful to treat the system as a ferromagnet in the presence of a small symmetry breaking field .",
    "the hartree - fock approximation , in which many - electron states are approximated by single slater determinants , provides a simple explanation for itinerant electron ferromagnetism that is often qualitatively correct . for non - interacting electrons ,",
    "energy is minimized by occupying both spin - states of each single particle energy level .",
    "( if the number of majority - spin electrons exceeds the number of minority - spin electrons it is necessary to occupy higher energy single - particle levels . )",
    "the ground state thus has equal numbers of majority - spin and minority - spin electrons if the total number of electrons is even and the difference is one if the total number of electrons is odd .",
    "this statement applies for an arbitrary spin - quantization axis .",
    "as long as there is no spin - orbit coupling , the hamiltonian is invariant under global spin rotations and the total spin of all electrons is a good quantum number .",
    "the above statement is equivalent to the observation that for non - interacting electrons the ground state always has total spin @xmath30 if the number of electrons is even and total spin @xmath31 if the number of electrons is odd .",
    "however , interaction energies are lower in single - slater - determinant states with higher values of the total spin and , generally , is minimized in fully spin - polarized states with @xmath32 . as in the familiar hund",
    "s rules from atomic physics , higher spin states tend to have lower interaction energies because like - spin electrons are prevented from being at the same position by the pauli exclusion principle and therefore have more energetically favorable spatial correlations . in the hartree - fock approximation , or in closely related spin - density - functional approximations ,",
    "an itinerant electron system is expected to be ferromagnetic if the reduction in interaction energy due to creating a finite spin - polarization state exceeds the cost in single - particle kinetic energy , or more generally ` band ' energy .",
    "because of landau level degeneracy , the cost in kinetic energy of creating a finite spin polarization for electrons in a magnetic field is precisely zero unless @xmath33 is an even integer .",
    "hartree - fock or similar approximations would predict a ferromagnetic ground state for electrons at nearly any value of @xmath33 .",
    "in fact , this conclusion is incorrect .",
    "for example , at certain filling factors it is known @xcite that the interaction energy is minimized in a @xmath34 state .",
    "we do believe , however , that there exist finite ranges of filling factor over which the ground state has @xmath35 . for a deeper understanding of this behavior , we need a more rigorous argument .",
    "the approach we now describe is in the same spirit as the illuminating outlook on the spin - polarized fractional quantum hall effect that arises from appropriate hard - core model hamiltonians @xcite . as discussed for the case of interest below , these models have zero energy many - particle eigenstates that are often known analytically , are separated from other many - particle states by a finite gap , and have a degeneracy that increases with decreasing @xmath18 .",
    "the incompressible state responsible @xcite for a quantum hall effect transport anomaly in such a model is the nondegenerate maximum @xmath18 zero energy eigenstate .",
    "the zero energy eigenstates at lower densities constitute the portion of the spectrum that involves only the degrees of freedom of the , in general fractionally charged @xcite , quasiholes of the incompressible state .",
    "it is assumed that the difference between the model hamiltonian and the true hamiltonian is a sufficiently weak perturbation that the quasihole states are still well separated from other states in the hilbert space , although accidental degeneracies will be lifted in the spectrum of the true hamiltonian .",
    "here we apply this approach to argue that the ground state at @xmath36 is a quantum hall ferromagnet with @xmath37 .    for our analysis",
    "we use the symmetric gauge in which the single - particle orbitals @xcite in the lowest landau level are @xmath38 where @xcite @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the cartesian components of the two - dimensional coordinate .",
    "we study here a hard - core model for which the interaction is : @xmath43 at strong magnetic fields the low - energy hamiltonian is simply the projection of this interaction onto the lowest landau level @xcite .",
    "many - particle wavefunctions that are zero energy eigenstates of this hamiltonian must vanish when any two - particles are at the same position and must therefore have the difference coordinate for each pair of particles as a factor : @xmath44 = \\big [ \\prod_{i < j } ( z_{i}-z_{j } ) \\big ] \\ , \\psi_{b}[z,\\chi ] .",

    "this simple observation leads to the conclusions we reach below .    in these notes",
    "we discuss only the case where @xmath49 ; the same approach can @xcite be extended to @xmath50 to elucidate the physics of charged excitations in quantum hall ferromagnets but here we will follow another line for this part of the discourse . for @xmath49",

    "we are able to conclude that the ground state is a strong ferromagnet with no orbital degeneracy .",
    "the ease with which this conclusion can be reached contrasts markedly with the case of the hubbard model where enormous effort has yielded relatively few firm results @xcite .",
    "when zeeman coupling is included in the hamiltonian , the ground state will be the member of this @xmath54 fold degenerate multiplet for which all spins are aligned with the magnetic field , _ i.e. _ the state with @xmath55 .      in this section",

    "instantons are finite excitation energy extrema of an energy ( or action ) functional , in which the variation of the field is localized in space . typically , the stability of an instanton is associated with a topological classification of field configurations . for @xmath57 models in two space dimensions and with three - dimensional unit vector fields ,",

    "these non - analytic terms are interesting , since they can not be captured by perturbative theories , but they typically produce only subtle corrections to a temperature dependence that is dominantly controlled by thermally excited spin - wave excitations . in the case of quantum hall ferromagnets , however , skyrmions carry an electrical charge and as a consequence play a more prominent role in determining the physical properties of the system . to understand why skyrmions carry a charge it is useful to consider first the case of a non - interacting electron in the presence of a magnetic field that couples to its orbital degrees of freedom and an independent strong zeeman field that couples to its spin and",
