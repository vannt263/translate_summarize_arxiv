    "the @xmath2-@xmath3 correlation between supermassive black hole ( bh ) mass and the velocity dispersion of the surrounding stellar system indicates a significant connection between galaxy and bh assembly @xcite .",
    "thus , it is essential to establish the most basic bh parameters : their intrinsic distribution of masses and growth rates .",
    "it is extraordinarily difficult to measure bh masses directly , even in the nearby universe , because of the small spatial scales that must be resolved to probe the gravitational influence of the bh . in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , the technique of reverberation mapping @xcite employs high resolution in the time domain to probe gas dynamics on spatial scales close to the bh .",
    "however , the long - duration spectroscopic monitoring campaigns required for reverberation studies currently preclude the method from being applied to large numbers of objects .",
    "therefore , one must rely on even more indirect techniques of bh mass estimation to build up statistically significant samples .",
    "the `` virial '' method has been empirically calibrated from reverberation mapping experiments @xcite and allows a bh mass estimate from a one - time measurement of the width of a broad emission line and the agn luminosity ( see   2 ) . to facilitate application of the virial technique to large optical agn surveys ,",
    "versions have been developed for h@xmath0  at low redshift , for the doublet near 2800  at intermediate redshift , and for the doublet near 1550  at high redshift ( for recent prescriptions , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present evidence of a systematic discrepancy in -based bh mass estimates as a function of eddington ratio ( the ratio of the bolometric luminosity , @xmath4 , to the luminosity required for radiation pressure to balance the gravity of the bh ) , as well as a method to correct this trend .",
    "the standard equation for estimating bh masses in agns from single - epoch spectroscopy is : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the width of the broad emission line , @xmath7 is the continuum luminosity near the line , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are constants ( which vary from line to line ) .",
    "the dependence on @xmath7 arises because the distance of the broad emission line gas from the bh has been observed to correlate tightly with the agn luminosity over 4 orders of magnitude in @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "thus , the mass equation reverts to the simple , virial combination of radius and velocity .",
    "the calibration of these relations rests on the bedrock of reverberation mapping measurements of local agns .",
    "by far , the best reverberation mapping dataset exists for h@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath9 coefficients for both and principally rely on empirical correlations with h@xmath0-reverberation masses .",
    "however , whereas reverberation studies of a handful of objects are consistent with expectations from h@xmath0  @xcite , a clear indication of reverberation has not yet been found for . although the line has been seen to vary in both flux and width ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , only weak reverberation signals have been seen @xcite .",
    "thus , the mass relation for relies on the correlation of single - epoch estimates with h@xmath0  masses and the argument that and h@xmath0  have similar ionization potentials @xcite .    with the wide wavelength coverage of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) spectra , certain redshift windows allow for two of these three emission lines to be measured simultaneously : h@xmath0  and are both accessible for @xmath100.30.9 , while and can both be measured for @xmath101.72.2 . by comparing the bh mass estimates from the two lines , we are thus able to study systematic trends .",
    "such a comparison has been done previously for the _ mean relation _ , but the large sample size of the sdss permits an analysis of higher - order correlations , which prove to be quite important .",
    "shen et al .  (",
    "2008 ) have provided line width ( fwhm ) measurements and bh mass estimates  using the relations of @xcite and vestergaard & peterson ( 2006)for roughly 60,000 agns from the sdss , including @xmath18,000 with both h@xmath0  and , and @xmath115,000 with both and .",
    "they provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between and , but simply describe the ratio of h@xmath0  to fwhm as following a log - normal distribution with a mean of 0.0062  dex and a dispersion of 0.11  dex .",
    "shen et al .  noted that the relation of the two fwhms deviates slightly from a perfect correlation , but did not explore the issue further .    under the premise that h@xmath0",
    ", being the most extensively reverberation - mapped emission line , provides the best indicator of the bh mass , we examine agns having both h@xmath0  and mass measurements . due to uncertainties in the line width measurements ,",
    "we exclude the small number of agns that were flagged by shen et al .  as broad absorption line objects . however , the inclusion of these objects has negligible effect on our results . in figure  1",
    ", we plot the difference in the ( log of the ) bh mass as a function of eddington ratio - based bh mass . ] .",
    "the strong correlation implies that if is calibrated simply from the mean of the h@xmath0- relation , then it will underestimate the bh mass at low eddington ratio and overestimate the mass at high eddington ratio is seen when replacing fwhm with the inter - percentile value measurements of fine et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . ] .",
    "this would lead one to infer a narrower distribution of eddington ratios than actually exists .",
    "one way to quantify this effect is to measure the slope of the correlation    @xmath11\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 is the covariance matrix of the distribution shown in figure  [ fig : mass ] .",
    "a slope @xmath13  would imply that provided completely independent information on the bh mass , while @xmath14would imply that no information is conveyed by the measurement .",
    "the actual value is @xmath15 , which means that indicative of the bh mass , but must be treated with care .    simply modifying the luminosity - dependence of the mass formula ( i.e. , changing @xmath9 in eq .  [ 1 ] )",
    "can not remove the observed trend .",
    "therefore , to make a statistical correction to the -based masses , we adopt the following method .",
    "for the sdss objects with both h@xmath0  and fwhms , we look at agns with lines in a given 0.1  dex bin of fwhm and tabulate the distribution of h@xmath0  fwhms for those objects .",
    "we take those h@xmath0  distributions ( normalized appropriately ) as the probability distributions for the true fwhm underlying the observed value ( fig .  2 ; table  1 ) .    for any object with an accessible line , each bin in true fwhm",
    "is combined with the observed continuum luminosity to calculate a bh mass ( via eq .",
    "[ 1 ] ) , and the mass is then used with the object s bolometric luminosity to derive an eddington ratio .",
    "the probability for each bin of fwhm is added to the total number of objects contributing to the corresponding eddington ratio bin ( which are 0.2  dex - wide , allowing a one - to - one match between fwhm and eddington ratio bins ) .",
    "thus , each fwhm becomes a weighted distribution of eddington ratios+ measurements , it is given a probability of 1 within the bin corresponding to the fwhm .",
    "in the sample we consider , this applies to a single agn . ] , while h@xmath0- and -based eddington ratios contribute directly at their observed values .",
    "we now apply this technique to the shen et al .",
    "measurements of the uniformly selected subsample of sdss agns ( richards et al .",
    "we construct distributions of eddington ratios for sdss in ranges of ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) in figure  3 , showing the results both with ( solid ) and without ( dotted ) the substitution presented above .",
    "the statistics of the distributions are given in table  2 .",
    "after correcting the measurements in the uniformly selected sdss sample , we find that the average width of the eddington ratio distribution increased by 0.09  dex for objects in the redshift range 0.32.2 .",
    "we therefore find that the distribution of eddington ratios remains very narrow at @xmath10.4  dex , as was found by @xcite for the ages - i survey .    to test our procedure , we apply it to multiple subsamples for which we have both h@xmath0  and data .",
    "figure  [ fig : check ] shows the distribution of eddington ratios for each subsample calculated in two ways , first using the true h@xmath0  mass ( solid ) and second using our procedure applied to the mass ( dashed ) .",
    "the similarity of these distributions ( and the differences from the raw -based values , shown as the dotted histograms ) demonstrates that our procedure works well , recovering the true eddington ratio distribution from the derived masses .",
    "the general trend we observe could be explained physically if the location where lines are formed in the broad - line region depends on accretion rate . in this case , the radius - luminosity relation would also depend on eddington ratio and that would introduce an additional term in the virial mass relation . it would then be possible , in principle , to remove this dependence entirely analytically by fitting the observed correlation .",
    "we investigate this further in an upcoming work .    the virial method for bh mass estimation has opened a new window in the study of supermassive bh demographics . while each indicator has systematics that must be addressed ( i.e. , asymmetric line profiles , contamination from disk winds and metal lines , etc . )",
    ", it is important to understand and attempt to correct for these systematics so that this technique can be applied with confidence . in this contribution",
    ", we have identified a limitation in estimating bh masses from the line and presented a way to remove it by exploiting the overlap of and h@xmath0  measurements presented by shen et al .",
    "this method puts masses more securely on the same scale as h@xmath0 , which should be the most reliable in these studies . as the bias in the masses",
    "is also seen in our analysis of the 2df quasar redshift survey ( 2qz ) and the agn and galaxy evolution survey ( ages ) , in forthcoming work , we will apply our correction technique to those datasets ( including the expanded sample of ages - ii ) .",
    "understanding the transition between high - luminosity , high - redshift agns having a narrow eddington ratio distribution ( @xmath10.4  dex ) and low - luminosity , low - redshift agns with a broad eddington ratio distribution ( @xmath181  dex ; ho 2002 ; woo & urry 2002 ) can provide important constraints on the physics of bh accretion . to determine these distributions , it is critical to continue to improve bh mass estimates that can be used through the bulk of the cosmic agn activity .",
