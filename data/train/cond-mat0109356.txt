    "since long time it is a widely diffused opinion between physicists that the basis of statistical mechanics lies on dynamics . particularly , krylov @xcite has pointed out that the mixing properties of a dynamical system are responsible for its statistical behaviour ( herein we use this word as a synonym of sensitivity to initial conditions : @xmath0 , for a one - dimensional illustration ) . along",
    "this line , intensive work has been done , especially in situations were anomalous effects may arise ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) . in @xcite",
    "it was studied numerically the approach to equilibrium of an hamiltonian system , the standard map , also referred to as the kicked - rotator model : @xmath1 where @xmath2 .",
    "this map presents a simplectic structure that corresponds to an integrable system when @xmath3 , while , for large - enough values of @xmath4 , it is strongly chaotic ( in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] we display the phase portrait of the map ( [ std ] ) for typical values of @xmath4 ) .",
    "it was shown that for small values of the parameter @xmath4 ( where the border between the regular and the chaotic region becomes significant ) , the approach to equilibrium of the system displays an anomalous behaviour of the usual , boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) , statistical entropy ; anomaly that may open the door for a dynamical foundation of the tsallis thermodynamics . in this paper",
    "we review the numerical analysis @xcite , presenting some new results and making some further speculations .",

    "assuming a gibbsian point of view , we can study the system ( [ std ] ) ( in its @xmath7 space ) proceeding , for example , as follows .",
    "we start introducing a coarse - graining partition of the phase space by dividing it in @xmath8 cells of equal size , and we set many copies of the system ( @xmath9 points ) in a far - from - equilibrium situation putting all the @xmath9 points inside a single cell .",
    "the occupation number @xmath10 of each cell @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) provides a probability distribution @xmath13 , hence the definition of an entropy value : @xmath14 we remind that the entropic form ( [ st ] ) reduces to the bg entropy @xmath15 in the limit @xmath16 ( for a recent review on tsallis statistics , see @xcite ) . using then the dynamic equations ( [ std ] ) , at each step the points spread in the phase space causing the entropy value to change . finally , to extract a _",
    "quantity on the mapping phase space , we repeat the calculation setting the cell that contains the initial points in different positions chosen randomly all over the _ whole _",
    "unit square , and we take an average over all the different histories thus obtained . the key point is to perform many different histories so that the average stabilizes on a definite curve .",
    "the result of this analysis for fixed @xmath4 is then a single curve of the entropy versus time , for each entropic form @xmath17 ( in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] we show a typical case ) .",
    "[ fig_2 ]     for @xmath18 and @xmath19 , with @xmath20 and initial data chosen randomly all over the whole unit square ( see text ) .",

    "( b ) average over @xmath22 histories.,width=453 ]",
    "we know from the theory of chaos that when a map displays a strong chaotic behavior , the mixing is exponential . when we attempt an analysis like the one described in the previous section , there is just one value of @xmath23 for which the entropy displays a linear stage before saturation : @xmath19 ; moreover ( see @xcite ) , the slope of this linear stage is equal to the kolmogorov - sinai entropy rate ( i.e. , the positive lyapunov exponent ) .",
    "the resultant curve has the features of fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] ( b ) .",
    "if in the same time interval where @xmath24 grows linearly we use @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) the curve bends upward ( downward ) before saturation .",
    "this situation recalls the definition of the hausdorff s dimension of a space : taking _ first _ the limit @xmath27 and _ then _ the limit @xmath28 there is only one value of @xmath23 for which the entropy production is different from @xmath29 and from @xmath30 .    on the other side , if the phase space has characteristics like those in fig .",
    "[ fig_1](c ) , the islands - around - islands structure at the border between the strongly chaotic and the regular regions ( see , for example , @xcite ) slows down the mixing , making it to become a power - law mixing instead of an exponential one . in this case , for time not too large , the linear growth with time occurs for the entropy @xmath31 with @xmath32 ( @xmath33 for the standard map ) , and not for @xmath34 ( see fig . [ fig_3](a ) and [ fig_3](c ) ) . waiting enough time , after @xmath35 ,",
    "a crossover to the exponential mixing would occur , due to the rapidity of the exponential growth with respect to the power - law one .",
    "we have then two different statistical regimes for @xmath36 : first ( @xmath37 ) , one for which the mixing properties are well described by a tsallis entropy @xmath31 with @xmath32 ; then ( @xmath38 ) , one for which the mixing properities are well described by the usual bg entropy .",
    "the interesting point is that for some particular macroscopic conditions ( here represented by the value of the parameter @xmath4 ) , the complexification of the phase space ( especially when dimensionality increases ) may increase @xmath39 , keeping the system , for at least some interesting physical observations , in a meta - stable tsallis phase .",
    "this scenario is consistent with some anomalies observed in long range many - body hamiltonians @xcite that were presented at this congress .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] we present , for typical values of @xmath23 , how this anomalous stage in the entropy growth makes its appeareance , when one decreases @xmath40 under certain value .",
    "the crossover time @xmath39 increases when @xmath41 ( see inset of fig .",
