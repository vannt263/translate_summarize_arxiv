    "in this section , we provide more details on the derivation of the equations of the main text .",
    "first , we would like to describe the scattering between the exciton reservoir ( index @xmath70 ) and a polariton state ( index @xmath71 ) .",
    "in general , the rate equations for the exchange between such states can be written as follows :    @xmath72    where we have omitted all other terms , e.g. lifetime , spin relaxation , etc .",
    "the scattering mechanism can be the exciton - phonon interaction or the exciton - exciton interaction : in presence of a thermalized exciton reservoir , both give the same dependence on the temperature and energy difference : @xmath73 the excitonic fraction @xmath74 of the polariton state appears in the scattering rate because only the exciton can efficiently interact with phonons , or the other excitons .",
    "the coefficient @xmath29 is the same for both scattering rates , but since in one case ( scattering down ) the energy ( the phonon ) is emitted and in the other ( scattering up )  absorbed , the corresponding probability factors are different .",
    "our goal is now to simplify these expressions , in order to obtain an analytical solution . indeed ,",
    "if the polariton branch is far below the reservoir , the scattering backwards from this branch to the reservoir is small and can be safely neglected .",
    "however , if this branch is close to the reservoir , this scattering is not negligible , and we need to introduce a correction to the scattering rate @xmath75 in order to take this into account .",
    "indeed , in this case the scattering rates @xmath75 and @xmath76 become comparable , as well as the populations , and so it is possible to write simply the difference of both terms : @xmath77 which in the first order can be written as @xmath78    on the other hand , at strongly positive detunings @xmath79 ( @xmath80 is one half of the rabi splitting ) , both the photonic fraction @xmath81 and the relative energy of the polariton state with respect to the exciton @xmath82 scale as @xmath83 , which allows to simplify the expression for the scattering rate by using the photonic fraction instead of the energy difference : @xmath84 and the rate equation now contains a single term with a single effective scattering rate : @xmath85 in the main text , we omit the index @xmath86 on the scattering rate .",
    "the advantage of all these simplifications is that the final model with a reduced number of terms has a clear analytical solution for the polarization degree .",
    "in the main text , we have discussed that one can assume an energy dependence of the polarization degree within the reservoir : fully polarized particles are injected at high energy and they progressively lose their polarization as they relax in energy .",
    "therefore , if the upb is resonant with some particular energy state within the reservoir , there will be an incoming scattering rate towards this upb with a certain polarization degree ( higher than at the bottom of the exciton reservoir ) .",
    "these polarized polaritons of the upb will then lose their polarization within this branch , before being emitted out of the system . to obtain their final polarization degree ,",
    "let us consider the upb as a separate system with a pumping @xmath87 ( which describes the scattering from the reservoir ) carrying a polarization degree @xmath88 .",
    "the lifetime of the states of the upb is @xmath89 and the spin relaxation time @xmath90 .",
    "the rate equations for this reduced system can be written as follows :    @xmath91    the stationary solution of this system of equations is : @xmath92 which gives a simple expression for the polarization degree of the upb :    @xmath93    used in the main text .",

    "<S> @xmath16 mev , coupling between the trion to high order modes masks the polarisation degree of the trion - like lpb , so is neglected in the following analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the mpb polarisation degree is initially low at negative detunings before rising to a maximum close to zero trion - cavity detuning , before dropping and increasing to a maximum of around @xmath17% when slightly negatively detuned from x@xmath11 , before falling to the bare exciton level at positive detunings . </S>",
    "<S> finally the upb shows an almost linear increase in polarisation degree with detuning , to a maximum value of around 17% at the maximum probed positive detuning of @xmath18 mev . for all polariton branches , </S>",
    "<S> the maxima of polarisation degree are significantly enhanced in comparison to the bare exciton and trion resonances . </S>",
    "<S> similar behaviour is measured for a second mose@xmath0 sample with polarisation degrees of up to @xmath19% as shown in supplementary fig . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : figure3]a . excited valley polarised carriers relax to the reservoir of high k - vector excitons . </S>",
    "<S> the exciton depolarisation occurs through the mss mechanism @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the exciton valley pseudospin precesses about the k - dependent effective magnetic field shown in the inset of fig   [ fig : figure3]b , which is induced by the exciton exchange coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this precession combined with random disorder scattering leads to exciton valley pseudospin relaxation with a characteristic time @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> reservoir excitons , with non - radiative lifetime @xmath21 then relax towards the light - cone and form polaritons with a relaxation rate @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> further valley pseudospin relaxation can then occur in the polariton branches with a timescale @xmath23 before decay out of the cavity with a polariton radiative lifetime @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting rate equations can be found in the theoretical model section below . </S>",
    "<S> the exciton - photon detuning affects the circular polarisation degree of the polariton emission via the excitonic ( @xmath25 ) and trionic ( @xmath26 ) fractions of the polariton states determining the scattering rates towards these states , while the lifetimes of the states are affected via their photonic fraction ( @xmath27 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the following dependences for the scattering rates to the middle and lower polariton branches ( i = 3 , 4 ) , derived in supplementary note 1 , are given by :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the exciton energy relaxation rate . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering rates have to be proportional to the exciton fraction , and the exciton and trion are summed over , where we assume the presence of an extra electron does not change the relaxation mechanism . if the branch is completely excitonic it becomes degenerate with the exciton reservoir , and the scattering due to interaction with disorder towards the branch becomes balanced by an inverse scattering rate from the branch . </S>",
    "<S> the imbalance between the two scattering rates ( forward and backward ) @xmath30 is therefore proportional to the photonic fraction in the first order approximation , hence @xmath31 .    </S>",
    "<S> the upb is a special case , as it is always resonant with some states of the exciton reservoir at high k - vectors . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore possible for high momentum excitons to scatter directly to the photon - like upb states due to interaction with disorder . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding scattering rate is therefore only proportional to the photonic fraction , while the excitonic one does not play any role : i.e. the exchange between the exciton reservoir and the excitonic fraction of this branch is always strongly balanced . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , since the excitons do not need to relax their energy , and need only to change their momentum , the characteristic time of this process is that of momentum relaxation ( pseudospin relaxation ) , and not that of energy relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we assume that :    @xmath32    another consideration for the upb is that the direct scattering from the reservoir not only drains it , shortening its lifetime and increasing the average polarisation degree , but also brings strongly polarised particles from higher energy states directly into the resonant polariton states . since the spin precession rate is linearly proportional to the k - vector , we assume that the polarisation degree in the reservoir decreases linearly with energy , from 100% at the injection point ( @xmath33 mev ) down to @xmath34 at @xmath35 </S>",
    "<S> . this polarisation degree can then decay in the upb before being emitted out of the system , giving a renormalization @xmath36 , derived in supplementary note 2 . in order to reproduce the data the ratio of upb polariton population coming from this direct scattering from the reservoir compared to indirect relaxation ( eq .  [ eq : relaxation_rate ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is required to be @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> we take the exciton and trion lifetimes as @xmath38 ps and @xmath39 ps @xcite and assume that the non - radiative exciton reservoir lifetime is comparable to the exciton pl - lifetime ( @xmath40 ps ) . </S>",
    "<S> the photon lifetime measured from the cavity q - factor at large negative detuning is @xmath41 ps . </S>",
    "<S> finally we take the exciton energy relaxation rate to be @xmath42 ps to reproduce the data ; an upper limit of @xmath8 ps can be justified from the resolution - limited rise time for mose@xmath0 excitons in recent time resolved measurements @xcite . the polarisation dependence on detuning , shown in fig .   </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure3]c , is well reproduced using exciton and trion valley relaxation times of @xmath43 ps and @xmath44 ps respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement in polarisation degree of the lower and middle polariton branches relative to the bare monolayer case is due to cavity modified relaxation which allows mose@xmath0 excitons to relax from the reservoir into polariton states quickly , inhibiting complete spin relaxation in the reservoir . in these polariton states , which are formed with excitons around @xmath45 , the exciton lt - splitting is small and hence the spin relaxation from the excitonic component of the polariton is around @xmath19 times slower than the bare exciton , as explained below in the theoretical model section . </S>",
    "<S> this is much slower than the polariton radiative lifetime , allowing lower and middle polariton branch particles to decay radiatively without further significant depolarisation , and with higher retention of valley pseudospin . </S>",
    "<S> when the photonic fraction of the polariton is high , relaxation into these polariton branches is less efficient causing larger accumulation of particles in the reservoir and hence low polarisation degree . at high excitonic fractions , scattering from the reservoir into these polariton branches </S>",
    "<S> is efficient , but the low photonic fraction , which determines the radiative decay and hence the imbalance between forward and backward scattering between polariton and reservoir states , leads to a longer time spent in the reservoir and hence low polarisation of emitted light . at intermediate detunings and roughly equal exciton and photon fractions a maximum in polarisation degree </S>",
    "<S> is seen which is a comprimise of efficient relaxation due to the exciton component and efficient radiative decay due to the photonic component . </S>",
    "<S> the high degree of valley polarisation in the upb is due to direct scattering of high momentum excitons through interaction with disorder , populating the upb with highly polarised particles which decay quickly due to their photonic component .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we observe clear retention of valley polarisation in mose@xmath0 exciton - polaritons . </S>",
    "<S> the strong dependence on exciton - trion - photon components can be well described by a dynamical model that incorporates modified relaxation and state lifetimes arising from strong coupling with the cavity mode . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that the valley pseudospin relaxation time for mose@xmath0 excitons is sub - ps , indicating that the low polarisation retention of mose@xmath0 is due to fast precession of exciton pseudospin caused by the mss mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> this depolarisation caused by disorder scattering is likely suppressed in tmds with low energy dark states due to the additional fast decay channel , providing insight into the anomolous behavior of mose@xmath0 in comparison to wse@xmath0 , ws@xmath0 and mos@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - valley locking inherited by tmd polaritons from their excitonic component offers new avenues for valley - dependent polariton - polariton interactions @xcite where the populations of polaritons in k and k valleys can be controlled with circularly polarised excitation . </S>",
    "<S> this allows the utlisation of the valley degree of freedom in polariton condensates @xcite , the optical spin hall effect @xcite , optical spin switching @xcite and polarisation bistabilities @xcite . </S>"
