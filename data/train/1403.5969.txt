    "let @xmath2 be a hilbert space .",
    "a set of elements @xmath3 in @xmath2 ( counting multiplicity ) is called a _ frame _ if there exist two positive constants @xmath4 and @xmath5 such that for any @xmath6 we have @xmath7 the constants @xmath4 and @xmath5 are called the _ lower frame bound _ and the _ upper frame bound _ , respectively . a frame",
    "is called a _ tight frame _ if @xmath8 . in this paper",
    "we focus mostly on real finite dimensional hilbert spaces with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , although we shall also discuss the extendability of the results to the complex case .",
    "let @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "it is called the _ frame matrix _ for @xmath12 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath12 is a frame if and only if the @xmath13 matrix @xmath14 has rank @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , the optimal frames bounds are given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the singular values of @xmath14 . throughout this paper",
    "we shall identify without loss of generality a frame @xmath12 by its frame matrix .",
    "the main focus of the paper is on the _ erasure robustness _ property for a frame .",
    "this property arise in applications such as communication where data can be lost or corrupted in the process of transmission .",
    "suppose that we have a frame @xmath14 that is _ full spark _ in the sense that every @xmath15 columns of @xmath14 span @xmath18 , it is theoretically possible to erase up to @xmath19 data from the full set of data @xmath20 while still reconstruct the signal @xmath21 .",
    "this is a simple consequence of the property that with the remaining available data @xmath22 with @xmath23 , @xmath21 is uniquely determined because @xmath24 . in practice , however , the condition number of the matrix @xmath25_{j\\in s}$ ] could be so poor that the reconstruction is numerically unstable against the presence of additive noise in the data .",
    "thus robustness against data loss and erasures is a highly desirable property for a frame .",
    "there have been a number of studies that aim to address this important issue .    among the first studies of erasure - robust frames",
    "was given in @xcite .",
    "it was shown in subsequent studies that that unit norm tight frames are optimally robust against one erasure @xcite while grassmannian frames are optimally robust against two erasures @xcite .",
    "the literature on erasure robustness for frames is quite extensive , see e.g. also @xcite . in general , the robustness of a frame @xmath14 against @xmath26-erasures , where @xmath27 , is measured by the maximum of the condition numbers of all @xmath28 submatrices of @xmath14 .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath29 and let @xmath30 denote the @xmath31 submatrix of @xmath14 with columns @xmath32 for @xmath33 ( in its natural order , although the order of the columns is irrelevant ) .",
    "then the robustness against @xmath26-erasures of @xmath14 is measured by @xmath34 of course , the smaller @xmath35 is the more robust @xmath14 is against @xmath26-erasures . in @xcite , fickus and",
    "mixon coined the term _ numerically erasure robust frame ( nerf)_. a frame @xmath14 is @xmath36-nerf if @xmath37 thus in this case @xmath38 .",
    "note that for any full spark @xmath13 frame matrix @xmath14 and any @xmath39 there always exist @xmath40 such that @xmath14 is @xmath36-nerf .",
    "the main goal is to find classes of frames where the bounds @xmath41 , and more importantly , @xmath42 , are independent of the dimension @xmath15 while allowing the proportion of erasures @xmath43 as large as possible .",
    "the authors studied in @xcite the erasure robustness of @xmath44 , where the entries of @xmath45 are independent random variables of the standard normal @xmath46 distribution .",
    "it was shown that with high probability such a matrix can be good nerfs provided that @xmath47 is no less than approximately @xmath48 of @xmath49 .",
    "the authors also proved that equiangular frame @xmath14 in @xmath50 with @xmath51 vectors is a good nerf against up to about @xmath52% erasures .",
    "as far as the proportion of erasures is concerned this was the best known result for nerfs .",
    "however , the frame requires almost @xmath53 vectors .",
    "the authors posed as an open question whether there exist nerfs with @xmath54 .",
    "a more recent paper @xcite explored a deterministic construction based on certain group theoretic techniques .",
    "the approach offers more flexibility in the frame design than the far more restrictive equiangular frames .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the robustness of random frames .",
    "we provide a much stronger result for random frames , showing that for any @xmath55 , with very high probability , the frame @xmath44 is a @xmath56-nerf where @xmath57 depend only on @xmath58 and the aspect ratio @xmath59 .",
    "one version of our result is given by the following theorem .",
    "[ theo-1.1 ] let @xmath44 where @xmath45 is @xmath13 whose entries are independent gaussian random variables of @xmath60 distribution .",
    "let @xmath61 .",

    "later in the paper we shall provide more implicit estimates for @xmath57 that will allow us to easily compute them numerically .",
    "note that our result is essentially the best possible , as we can not go to @xmath70 .",
    "a corollary of the theorem is that for random gaussian frames the proportion of erasures @xmath43 can be made arbitrary large while the frames still maintain robustness with overwhelming probability .",
    "our theorem depends crucially on a refined estimate on the smallest singular value of a random gaussian matrix .",
    "there is a wealth of literature on random matrices .",
    "the study of singular values of random matrices has been particularly intense in recent years due to their applications in compressive sensing for the construction of matrices with the so - called _ restricted isometry property _",
    "( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "random matrices have also been employed for phase retrieval @xcite , which aims to reconstruct a signal from the magnitudes of its samples . for a very informative and comprehensive survey of the subject",
    "we refer the readers to @xcite , which also contains an extensive list of references ( among the notable ones @xcite ) . for the @xmath13 gaussian random matrix @xmath45 the expected value of @xmath71 and @xmath72 are asymptotically @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "many important results , such as the nerf analysis of random matrices in @xcite as well as results on the restricted isometry property in compressive sensing , often utilize known estimates of @xmath71 and @xmath72 based on hoeffding - type inequalities . one good such estimate is @xmath75 see @xcite .",
    "the problem with this estimate is that even by taking @xmath76 we only get a bound of @xmath77 even though the probability in this case is 0 .",
    "thus estimates such as ( [ 1.2 ] ) that cap the decay rate are often inadequate . when applied to the erasure robustness problem for frames they usually put a cap on the proportion of erasures . to go further we must prove an estimate that will allow the exponent of decay to be much larger .",
    "we achieve this goal by proving the following theorem :    [ theo-1.2 ] let @xmath45 be @xmath13 whose entries are independent random variables of standard normal @xmath60 distribution .",
    "let @xmath61 . then for any @xmath78 there exist constants @xmath79 depending only on @xmath80 and @xmath81 such that @xmath82 furthermore",

    "one of the very important estimates is @xmath87 see @xcite .",

    "* the fact that @xmath93 is independent of the choice of @xmath21 is a well know fact , which stems from the fact that the entries of @xmath95 are again independent standard normal random variables for any orthogonal @xmath96 matrix @xmath97 . in particular",
    ", one can always find an orthogonal @xmath97 such that @xmath98 .",

    "both @xmath143 only depend on @xmath81 and @xmath80 .",
    "the existence part of the theorem is thus proved .    while we have already a good explicit estimate @xmath139 , it remains to establish the explicit formula for @xmath144 .",
