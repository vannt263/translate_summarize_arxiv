    "two - component atomic fermi gases provide an ideal experimental system in which to investigate fermion pairing and superfluidity in a controllable manner .",
    "@xcite for example , one can use a magnetically - tunable feshbach resonance to access the unitary regime , where the scattering length diverges and one has a strongly - interacting fermionic superfluid that is ` universal ' .",
    "@xcite of particular interest is the case where there is a spin imbalance that frustrates pairing between fermion species , because this is a situation that arises in many fields of physics , ranging from qcd to superconductivity .",
    "@xcite here , a central question has been : what is the critical spin polarization @xmath0 at which pairing and superfluidity are destroyed for a unitary trapped fermi gas at equilibrium ?",
    "however , current experiments produce different answers .",
    "the experimental group at mit finds that @xmath1 ,  @xcite while experiments on highly - elongated trapped gases at rice university  @xcite suggest that @xmath0 is at least 90% . moreover , even though the critical polarization is known to be a strong function of temperature , where @xmath0 decreases with increasing temperature , the different @xmath0 s observed in experiment are unlikely to be caused by differences in temperature since both experimental groups have claimed that their temperatures are low enough to yield @xmath0 s that are close to the zero - temperature result .",
    "thus , there is a real discrepancy in the measured @xmath0 and a resolution of this problem has potentially important implications for the nature of the paired superfluid phase in a finite - sized system .",
    "here we propose that the high @xmath0 observed in the rice experiment was due to their trapped spin - imbalanced gas being out of equilibrium .",
    "we show that a combination of the trap geometry and the evaporative cooling scheme implemented in the rice experiment can induce a spin current along the trap axis , which in turn creates a substantially non - equilibrium polarization pattern that favors a superfluid at the trap center .",
    "to understand how such a spin current can be generated , one must first examine the evaporative cooling process . here ,",
    "the temperature , and entropy per atom , of a trapped gas is lowered when the most energetic atoms escape over the `` lip '' of the trap  the route of escape with the lowest potential barrier to be surmounted . for a partially - polarized fermi gas at temperature @xmath2 ,",
    "the rate of thermal activation over this barrier is larger for the majority species by a factor of @xmath3}$ ] , assuming the two species are subject to the same trapping potential , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 are the chemical potentials for the majority and minority species , respectively .",
    "thus , at low t , the flux of evaporating atoms passing over the lip is essentially fully polarized , and we have _ evaporative depolarization _",
    "in addition to evaporative cooling ( as stated in ref .  ) .",
    "the rice experiments we are considering  @xcite had both a long , thin , high - aspect - ratio optical trap and a nonuniform magnetic field that contributed to the axial confinement of the gas .",
    "as a result , the lowest barrier for the atoms to escape from the trap was at the axial center , with the atoms escaping over this `` lip '' in the radial direction ( and downwards , due to gravity ; see fig .  [ fig : spin_current](a ) ) . elsewhere in the trap",
    "the barrier to escape was significantly higher , so at their lowest temperatures , essentially all of the evaporating atoms escaped radially at the axial center of their high - aspect - ratio trap .    to achieve low temperatures in the rice experiment ,",
    "the height of this barrier was lowered by reducing the intensity of the optical trap .",
    "it was at the lowest temperatures that the unusually large @xmath0 was observed , along with strong deviations from the equilibrium local density approximation ( lda ) in the shapes of the regions occupied by the superfluid and partially - polarized normal phases .",
    "@xcite what we propose happened here is that the evaporation , with the @xmath6 atoms rapidly escaping radially over the trap lip , greatly depleted any excess unpaired @xmath6 atoms from the axially central region of the cloud occupied by the paired superfluid phase .",
    "this depletion , which is apparent in the _ in situ _ density measurements ,  @xcite substantially suppressed @xmath7 in that region ( evaporative depolarization ) .",
    "the flux of evaporating @xmath6 atoms over the lip then had to come from the fully - polarized normal regions at the axial ends of the cloud and be driven through the partially - polarized region and across the normal / superfluid interface by a substantial axial gradient of @xmath7 .",
    "this resulted in the partially - polarized region of the cloud being much smaller in axial extent than it would be at equilibrium , which is the strong deviation from equilibrium lda that we will focus on in this paper .",
    "there was another important deviation from equilibrium lda : the aspect ratio of the central superfluid region was substantially reduced from that of the cloud as a whole ; it is this latter feature that was emphasized in ref .  .",
    "we emphasize that the non - equilibrium scenario described above assumes that the atom transport is effectively one - dimensional ( 1d ) along the axial ( @xmath8 ) direction , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin_current](a ) .",
    "@xcite thus , it is only appropriate for high - aspect - ratio gas clouds with sufficiently low particle number , like those in the rice experiments ( aspect ratio @xmath9 ) at the lowest temperatures . for higher temperatures ( less evaporative cooling ) , where the particle numbers are larger",
    ", there is a fully - polarized layer of @xmath6 atoms _ fully _ surrounding the cloud ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spin_current](b ) ) , as can be seen in _ in situ _ density measurements .",
    "@xcite in this case , the evaporation will simply draw @xmath6 atoms from this fully - polarized layer rather than driving a spin current through the superfluid and partially - polarized normal regions , so a strong chemical potential gradient is not produced . the mit experiments , on the other hand ,",
    "used trapped gases with a much lower aspect ratio ( @xmath10 ) and at least an order of magnitude more atoms in the cloud .",
    "thus , the 3d scenario for highly - polarized gases depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin_current](b ) remains correct for these experiments , even at the lowest temperatures , and so their observed @xmath0 agrees with the equilibrium result from quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations .",
    "to model the spin transport in the rice experiment at the lowest temperatures , we will assume that atoms are only removed from the gas at @xmath11 , the position of the trap lip , and that only @xmath6 atoms are evaporating ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spin_current](a ) ) . also , we approximate any nonuniformities in the local chemical potentials as 1d , so that we only consider non - equilibrium _ axial _ gradients in @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "since we are primarily interested in the non - equilibrium polarization pattern within a trap , and this is not strongly dependent on the local temperature , we will ignore any gradients in temperature .",
    "we further assume that the atomic gas cloud is in _ mechanical _ equilibrium throughout the evaporation process , since the time required to equalize a pressure difference in the cloud is much smaller than both the duration of the evaporation and the time for spin diffusion along the length of the cloud .",
    "this implies that the local pressure @xmath12 always satisfies : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the _ local _ total density and @xmath15 is the axial trapping potential .",
    "we can determine @xmath0 of a spin - imbalanced fermi gas in the presence of a spin current by focussing on the unitary _ normal _ gas at low temperatures . here",
    ", the equation of state for the pressure at @xmath16 is accurately known from qmc calculations  @xcite and is given by @xmath17\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the atomic mass , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . for the spin transport",
    "that we are interested in , we also expect eq .   to provide a reasonable approximation for the pressure at low temperatures within the degenerate regime @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "in addition to eq .  , we require equations for the _ spin _ density @xmath24 and _ spin _ current density @xmath25 .",
    "we will assume that the `` dc '' spin transport in the partially - polarized normal fermi gas is diffusive , with the dissipation being driven by the interspecies interactions .",
    "indeed , this situation may be regarded as the cold - atom analogue of spin coulomb drag in electron systems .",
    "@xcite by transforming to the inertial reference frame where locally @xmath26 , i.e.where there is no net transport of the total mass density and the motion is purely diffusive , we obtain current densities : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the local equilibrium density gradient and @xmath29 is the diffusion constant for each spin .",
    "one can determine @xmath30 as a function of the local densities using the lda equilibrium condition for the chemical potentials of each spin : @xmath31 note that this automatically implies that there are no gradients in the chemical potential difference @xmath32 at equilibrium . combining eq .   with the expression for the spin current density in this frame @xmath33",
    "yields an expression for the spin diffusion constant : @xmath34 transforming back to the lab reference frame then gives us the spin current density : @xmath35 where the average net velocity @xmath36 .    for a dilute gas with @xmath37-wave scattering , we have diffusion constants @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the average velocity of the random particle motion and @xmath40 is the scattering rate of each species . in the regime @xmath41 , the scattering rate for the @xmath42 atoms at unitarity is :  @xcite @xmath43 by knowing @xmath44 and @xmath39 , we can also extract an expression for the @xmath6 scattering rate since the mean free paths @xmath45 are simply related by the densities : @xmath46 .",
    "one can see this from the fact that @xmath47 in a dilute gas , where the scattering cross section @xmath48 is a universal function of the density at unitarity . also , we can approximate the velocities as @xmath49 .",
    "thus , we obtain the ` universal ' spin diffusion constant : @xmath50^{-1}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the dependence of @xmath51 on temperature is that of a fermi liquid , as expected .",
    "experiments to explicitly measure this ` universal ' transport constant would be welcome . referring to fig .",
    "[ fig : spin_current](a ) , if the fully - polarized normal regions at the axial ends are sufficiently large ( i.e.  if the gas has a sufficiently high global polarization ) , then we can treat them as stationary spin current sources and approximate the spin current through the partially - polarized region as _ steady - state _ : @xmath52 in this case , by solving eq .   with @xmath53 , together with eq .  , we find that the deviation of the _ total _ polarization from equilibrium for a given _ local _ polarization at the trap center is determined by the simple dimensionless quantity : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the total axial length of the cloud .",
    "the critical total polarization @xmath0 for a trapped cloud is obtained by setting the local densities @xmath56 at the trap center , which is its value at the superfluid - normal transition in the uniform system .",
    "@xcite this corresponds to the situation where a trapped normal gas is on the verge of forming a superfluid core . to obtain a quantitative estimate of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath57 in a high - aspect - ratio harmonic trap ,",
    "we determine the chemical potentials as a function of @xmath8 and then we use lda in the radial direction @xmath58 to now include the radial trapping potential @xmath59 and obtain the densities of each spin : @xmath60~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] integrating these densities numerically then yields the total polarization @xmath61 .    as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : critpol ] , the critical polarization @xmath0 corresponds ( by construction ) to the equilibrium qmc result  @xcite when @xmath62 , but it dramatically increases with increasing @xmath57 and asymptotically approaches 100% polarization as @xmath63 .",
    "this increase in @xmath0 is due to the partially - polarized region being compressed along the axial direction relative to its extent in equilibrium lda ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : critpol ] ) , an effect which has been observed in the rice experiments . to obtain @xmath64",
    ", we require an evaporation rate of order @xmath65 atoms / sec if we use typical parameter values in the rice experiment towards the end of evaporation : @xmath66 , @xmath67 mm , @xmath68@xmath69 , @xmath70m@xmath71/s , and a trap radius of 10 @xmath72 m .",
    "this appears consistent with the data in ref .",
    "since the actual evaporation rate is estimated to be roughly 10@xmath73 atoms / sec at the time when the optical absorption images are taken .",
    "for completeness , we now examine the effect of a superfluid core on the spin current in the trapped gas when @xmath74 . for this purpose , we consider spin transport through the superfluid / normal interface .",
    "we approximate the interface to be a 1d sharp step - function in the local superfluid gap @xmath75 and densities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : interface ] ) , which is reasonable when @xmath2 is well below the temperature at the tricritical point .",
    "@xcite clearly , our assumption of mechanical equilibrium implies that the pressures in each phase are equal at the interface : @xmath76 .",
    "since we are focussing on low @xmath2 , we will use the @xmath16 expression for the superfluid pressure : @xmath77 where @xmath78 according to qmc calculations ,  @xcite and the superfluid chemical potential @xmath79 .",
    "we further assume that any quasiparticles in the superfluid region are rapidly evaporated so that we can neglect any quasiparticles incident on the interface from the superfluid side .",
    "effectively , this amounts to assuming a strong drop in the local temperature of the quasiparticles as one crosses the interface from the normal to the superfluid side .",
    "while this is not essential to our picture , this gives a simplification and likely captures what happens when the lip of the trap is held very low .",
    "the scattering problem at the superfluid / normal interface has already been examined in ref .  .",
    "however , they only focussed on thermal transport via quasiparticle transmission through the interface . in our case",
    ", we must consider both mass and spin transport across the interface , since they can both change the local polarization",
    ". we must therefore take account of any mass transported via andreev reflection .",
    "for example , if the chemical potentials @xmath80 , @xmath81 in the normal phase lie within the gapped region of the superfluid , like in fig",
    ".  [ fig : interface ] , the andreev process results in a flux of pairs ( mass ) into the superfluid when @xmath82 and a flux out of the superfluid when @xmath83 , even at @xmath16 .    following the approach of ref .  , we can write the current density of @xmath6 atoms flowing into the superfluid as : @xmath84\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) is the momentum normal to the interface of the incident @xmath6 atom ( reflected @xmath42 hole ) , @xmath87 is the energy and @xmath88 is the fermi function .",
    "the coefficients @xmath89 and @xmath90 correspond to the probability of andreev reflection and ordinary reflection , respectively . clearly , when @xmath91 , there is no quasiparticle transmission and we must have @xmath92 .",
    "also , for @xmath93 ( appropriate for low @xmath2 ) , the current density of _ @xmath42 holes _ crossing the interface into the superfluid has the same expression as in eq .  , but with @xmath6 and @xmath42 interchanged , and @xmath94 .",
    "note that although our calculation of reflection probabilities relies on the mean - field bogoliubov - de - gennes equations , the chemical potentials , pressure and superfluid gap that we use are from @xmath16 qmc results .",
    "@xcite    referring to fig .",
    "[ fig : interface ] , if we consider chemical equilibrium , where @xmath95 , then at finite @xmath2 we find that we have both a flux of @xmath6 atoms entering the superfluid region and a flux of @xmath42 atoms leaving the superfluid region ( or a flux of @xmath42 holes flowing in the opposite direction ) . however , atoms , not holes , are removed during evaporative cooling and thus we require the flux @xmath96 across the interface .",
    "this is achieved by setting @xmath97 such that the concomitant mass current flowing into the superfluid cancels the @xmath42 hole current , so there is only a net motion of @xmath6 atoms .",
    "thus , the superfluid core ensures that the flux of evaporating atoms remains spin - polarized even when @xmath98 is suppressed at the trap center due to local evaporative depolarization .",
    "to summarize , we have shown that evaporative cooling of a trapped , partially - polarized , high - aspect - ratio atomic fermi gas can create a spin current which in turn can produce the large @xmath0 seen in the rice experiment .",
    "moreover , when this low - temperature gas cloud develops a superfluid core , we find that the atom flux across the superfluid - normal interface remains spin - polarized , with a small drop in the average chemical potential across the interface .",
    "an alternative _ equilibrium _ explanation for the large @xmath0 in the rice experiment is that finite - size effects in a high - aspect - ratio trapped gas are responsible .",
    "@xcite however , microscopic studies of the surface tension at the superfluid / normal interface in a trapped gas suggest that this scenario is not quantitatively consistent with experiments .",
    "@xcite two possible avenues for the experiments to differentiate between equilibrium and non - equilibrium scenarios are : ( 1 ) to explicitly look for relaxation ( on time scales that we estimate to be @xmath99 sec ) towards equilibrium after deepening the optical trap and thus slowing or stopping the evaporative depolarization ; and ( 2 ) to move the trap lip off - center with respect to the optical trap minimum by moving the minimum of the magnetic potential .",
    "if our non - equilibrium explanation is correct , at the lowest temperatures the superfluid core should form where the local evaporative depolarization is occurring at the trap lip ; at equilibrium the superfluid will instead form at the minimum of the overall trapping potential where the density is highest . indeed , a very recent experiment  @xcite by salomon s group at the ens already casts some doubt on the alternative equilibrium explanation : their trap aspect ratio ( @xmath100 ) approaches that used in the rice experiment , yet they observe a @xmath0 that agrees with the mit result . whilst it is still possible",
    "that this lower @xmath0 may be because the temperature in the ens experiment is higher , another key difference between the rice and ens experiments is that the time scale for evaporation in the ens experiment is longer ,  @xcite a fact which appears to be consistent with our non - equilibrium proposal .",
    "more generally , the non - equilibrium scenario we have analyzed here suggests a route towards the realization and investigation of spin currents in a strongly - interacting fermi gas .",
    "moreover , it illustrates the importance of non - equilibrium phenomena in cold - atom systems . in typical experiments with ultracold atoms ,",
    "the dynamic range between the microscopic time scales for atom motion , atom - atom interactions and the total duration of the experiments is not so large , often 5 orders of magnitude or less .",
    "this means that full equilibration of a large cloud of atoms might not be possible under some circumstances .",
    "here we have discussed a trapped unitary fermi gas , where the microscopic collision rate at low temperature is roughly @xmath101 .",
    "when one instead considers atoms in an optical lattice , the microscopic rates for atom hopping or for superexchange can be substantially slower than this , making it even easier to drive the system out of equilibrium .",
