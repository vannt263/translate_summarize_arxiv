    "nonlinear dynamical systems with distributed and discrete parameters are widespread in heavy , extractive and manufacturing industry , as well as in space - system engineering @xcite .",
    "different complex dynamical processes are possible in such hybrid systems , including vibrations , which always have negative influence on their functioning and sometimes even can result in system breakdown .",
    "therefore , one of the important aims of investigation is to study possible vibrations in such nonlinear dynamical systems with distributed and discrete parameters , as spacecrafts of big size , as well as to find ways how it is possible to decrease harmful effect of vibrations on normal functioning of the systems .",
    "spacecrafts of big size are considered , which contain some flexible elastic elements .",
    "specifications for the spacecrafts ( for example , in the control of form and accuracy of space antenna orientation ) presume that intensive vibrations in such flexible constructions are not admissible",
    ". passive damping of vibrations is often applied for elimination of vibrations , but strict specifications for the spacecrafts require other methods to control vibrations .",
    "one possibility is to use systems with active control of vibrations .",
    "the problem is to study the effect of active control on the dynamical characteristics of the elastic construction with distributed parameters .",
    "there were several attempts to solve this problem before , using mathematical models of the system which account discrete parameters only ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these results are not accurate enough .",
    "following @xcite , we take into account all the distributed parameters of the flexible elastic construction . the mathematical model becomes a nonlinear boundary value problem , which consists of a partial differential equation and nonlinear boundary conditions .    for this new model",
    "it is possible to develop both asymptotical and numerical methods .",
    "this allows to obtain frequencies of possible vibrations @xcite . in this way we can also determine conditions of stability under active control of vibrations . after analysis of influence of different parameters of the considered systems it is possible to make a conclusion about the optimal parameters .",
    "the results of this paper may be applied in space - system engineering for design of new improved technical systems .",
    "in the given paper a flexible elastic system with distributed and discrete parameters is analyzed .",
    "the basic mathematical model , which is used for investigations , is borrowed from @xcite :    @xmath0    @xmath1    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the displacement of a point of the bar with abscissa @xmath4 , @xmath5 the bar cross - section area , @xmath6 the unit volume mass , @xmath7 the modulus of the material elasticity , @xmath8 the coefficient of dissipation in the bar material , @xmath9 the damping factor of the executive mechanism , @xmath10 the rigidity of the centering spring , @xmath11 the feedback coefficient , @xmath12 the specimen mass , and @xmath13 is the length of the elastic bar .",
    "it is necessary to point out that problem  is a nonconservative boundary value problem .",
    "this fact introduces considerable difficulties for the computation of an exact analytical solution of the problem .",
    "the non - conservatism is caused by the presence of the odd derivatives on time both in the equation of motion and in the boundary conditions and .",
    "this allows to assume that eigenvalues of the considered boundary value problem are complex numbers , what is in agreement with the results obtained in @xcite .",
    "problem  is a nonclassical boundary value problem , and it is necessary to take into account real features of objects functioning . the aim is to obtain approximations for the eigenvalues of this system .",
    "we will tackle the problem both from a theoretical and a numerical point of view .      in order to account the influence of different system parameters onto possible vibrations , as well as to simplify cumbersome calculations ,",
    "we introduce dimensionless variables @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and dimensionless parameters @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "then the dimensionless form of boundary problem  may be written as follows :    @xmath19    @xmath20    @xmath21    mathematical model ",
    "describes dynamical processes in the system with distributed parameters , and such system has infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore it is natural to assume that stationary operating conditions in the considered system are not always single - frequency ones .",
    "the first approach , which may be used for problem solving , is an asymptotical one .",
    "although at present numerous efficient methods for the investigation of vibrations have been developed , and mathematically justified , the most efficient ones are the asymptotical methods , especially the averaging method @xcite .",
    "this method is often used for the solution of boundary value problems appearing in the simulation of the behavior of real processes and in problems of optimal control .",
    "the idea of the averaging method is as follows : using some special operator , one replaces the system of differential equations under investigation by another system , the so - called averaged system",
    ". the last one should be simpler than the original system but at the same time it should describe the main features of the phenomenon under investigation .",
    "today the averaging method is developed for various classes of differential equations with large and small parameters , although in most cases the problem of its justification remained unsolved till now .    in case of the method of the small parameter",
    ", it is necessary to choose systems of equations of higher approximations whose solutions approximate the solutions of the original system of equations to within values proportional to integer powers of some small parameter .      in order to solve the boundary value problem  , it is expedient to apply the modifications of the asymptotical method of the small parameter .    to do this",
    ", it is necessary to take into account that equations  contain five dimensionless parameters .",
    "these parameters , as a rule , are less than unit , although they have different orders of smallness .",
    "dimensionless parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 are connected , respectively , with the viscous friction in the material of the bar and the centering spring , whereas dimensionless parameter @xmath24 is connected with the coefficient of the velocity feedback .",
    "therefore , parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are , for real dynamical systems , of magnitude order less than dimensionless parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "this allow us to assume that dimensionless parameters characterizing dissipation of different physical nature are proportional to some common small parameter @xmath27 ,    @xmath28    with such an assumption , mathematical model  may be transformed to the form :    @xmath29    @xmath30    @xmath31    we are now in conditions to apply for investigations some modifications of asymptotical methods of the small parameter .      as it was mentioned above , mathematical model",
    " includes different factors , which characterize energy dissipation in the system .",
    "therefore both equation of motion and boundary conditions , contain the odd derivatives on time , which represent non - conservatism of the physical model of our hybrid system .",
    "but for the first approximation we can neglect all the dissipative factors of the mathematical model , and consider its conservative case , put @xmath32 .",
    "then we will have @xmath33 and problem  simplifies to    @xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath36    it is easy to solve exactly problem  and obtain the next transcendental equation for determination of the eigenvalues :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is an eigenvalue of the conservative boundary problem , which is a real number .",
    "formula can be used as the initial estimate of the complex eigenvalues of the original nonconservative boundary problem .      according with @xcite",
    ", we will look for the solution of equation in the following form :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is an eigenvalue of the nonconservative boundary problem , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are arbitrary constants , and @xmath43 .",
    "solution satisfies equation with accuracy @xmath44 .",
    "after substitution of solution into boundary conditions and , and their satisfaction with the same accuracy @xmath44 , we obtain a transcendental equation of the form    @xmath45    the solution of this equation at @xmath46 is known , and it determines eigenvalues @xmath38 of the corresponding conservative boundary problem .    in solving transcendental equation , it is necessary to account smallness of damping forces .",
    "this allow us to assume that the correction factor for non - conservatism is a quantity of order @xmath27 ,    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is an eigenvalue of the corresponding conservative problem , and @xmath49 is the correction factor for the non - conservatism of the problem .",
    "substituting into transcendental equation , and cutting off a taylor series for left - hand side of this equation as follows    @xmath50    it is possible to present the next expression for @xmath51 :    @xmath52}{{\\eta}^{2}{\\delta}^{2}{w}^{4}+ \\left(\\delta\\,{\\eta}-2\\,\\delta+{\\eta}\\right)\\eta { w}^{2 } + \\eta+1 } } \\ , .\\ ] ]    thus , eigenvalues of the nonconservative problem  are approximately determined in the following way :    @xmath53}{{\\eta}^{2}{\\delta}^{2}{w}^{4}+ \\left(\\delta\\,{\\eta}-2\\,\\delta+{\\eta}\\right)\\eta { w}^{2 } + \\eta+1 } } \\ , .\\ ] ]    now , it is possible to substitute the complex value found for @xmath40 into the exponential function of solution .",
    "analysis of the real part of the exponent allows to obtain condition    @xmath54\\eta { w}^{2}+\\eta+1 } } \\leq 0 \\ , , \\ ] ]    whose satisfaction leads to self - excitation of vibrations , and self - vibrations in case of equality .",
    "it is necessary also to point out that the imaginary part of the exponent represents the fundamental frequency of the nonconservative system .",
    "parameter @xmath24 , which may be adjusted by introducing different feedbacks , enters into inequality .",
    "hence , the possibility appears to control the frequency spectrum , on which vibrations excitation is possible , by varying dissipative characteristics of the hybrid dynamical system .",
    "it is known that in a conservative system ( at @xmath46 ) periodic motions appear with any amplitude dependent on initial conditions .",
    "but in the nonconservative system ( at @xmath55 ) they have only fixed amplitudes , which conform to equality of an energy present at the expense of negative resistance and energy dissipation , which is always present in a real dynamical system .",
    "thus , a solution of nonconservative boundary problem  may be sought for in the form    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is one of the solutions of the conservative problem .",
    "it is easy to obtain the next expression for such solution :    @xmath58    where @xmath41 has the meaning of amplitude , and it is necessary to select it close to amplitude of boundary cycle of self - sustained vibration system .",
    "then , after taking into account expressions and , as well as relationship for eigenvalues @xmath38 of conservative boundary problem  , the boundary problem  may be written as follows :    @xmath59    @xmath60    @xmath61",

    "it is known @xcite that a stationary solution exists only on the condition of orthogonality of external force and normal mode of a system .",
    "this condition determines an amplitude , which does not increase with time .",
    "therefore , for the considered boundary problem it is expedient to choose the solution in the form @xmath62 which reduces our problem to ordinary differential equations :    @xmath63    @xmath64    @xmath65 \\\\ = \\varepsilon \\sin(\\omega\\tau ) \\biggl[a \\omega^3 \\eta \\delta ( \\bar{\\nu } + \\bar{\\mu } )",

    "we have the most interesting case of self - excited vibrations in the system .",
    "the presence in of arbitrary constant @xmath70 signifies the dependence of vibrations amplitude @xmath41 on the initial conditions , which were not considered in our boundary problem .",
    "thus , it was confirmed again @xcite that , in order to find some possibilities of vibrations control in the hybrid system , one does not need to introduce the initial conditions , being enough to study the frequencies of vibrations .",
    "the other approach , which may be used for problem investigations , is a numerical one .    in this paper , the numerical method of the normal fundamental system of solutions",
    "is used for determination of the eigenvalues of the boundary value problem . the justification of the convergence of the method of normal fundamental systems of solutions , together with the theory which explains its good accuracy when applied to vibration problems , can be found in the monograph @xcite .      taking into account that the eigenvalues are complex numbers , the solution may be searched in the following form :    @xmath72    where @xmath73 and @xmath38 are , respectively , the real and the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues .",
    "they are real constants , which should be determined .",
    "after substitution of in the boundary problem  , the real and imaginary parts of the equation of motion are given by @xmath74    in order to ensure the compactness of further expressions , let us make the following definitions : @xmath75 with these notations , after separation of their real and imaginary parts , boundary conditions and can be written as    @xmath76    @xmath77    an application of the numerical method of normal fundamental systems of solutions demands a presentation of the problem as a system of ordinary differential equations of the first order in the normal form , which satisfy some boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , in order to reduce to the necessary form , let us enter new functions @xmath78    then , the desired system of differential equations in the normal form may be written as @xmath79 where coefficients @xmath80 and @xmath81 are dependent on the sought - for quantities @xmath73 and @xmath38 : @xmath82    in new functions , the boundary conditions and will be transformed to the next ones :    @xmath83    @xmath84    now it is necessary to solve the boundary value problem , , . by means of any known numerical method , one can solve the cauchy problem for the set of equations four times with the following initial conditions :    @xmath85    where the first subscript of the function @xmath86 is a solution number , and the second one is a function number .    thus , the normal fundamental system of solutions @xmath87 for the set of differential equations may be generated . with the help of such system of solutions , general solution @xmath88 of set may be written as follows :    @xmath89    where @xmath90 are some coefficients , which should be determined .    using the property of the normal fundamental system of solutions @xmath91 from boundary condition it is easy to conclude that @xmath92 .",
    "now , satisfying also boundary conditions , we will obtain two linear algebraic equations in coefficients @xmath93 and @xmath94 : @xmath95 where coefficients @xmath96 @xmath97 are defined by @xmath98    then , the relation    @xmath99    is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a non - trivial solution of the homogeneous set of linear algebraic equations .",
    "this relation is also a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a non - trivial solution of the boundary value problem , , .",
    "it is an equation for a pair of numbers @xmath73 and @xmath38 , which may be determined as its roots .",
    "thus , from equation it is possible to determine complex eigenvalues @xmath100 of the boundary value problem .",
    "it is necessary also to point out that the determinant @xmath101 from expression is always non - negative , which is in agreement with the results obtained in @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the accuracy of determination of the boundary problem eigenvalues depends on the length of the integration interval for system .",
    "therefore , in order to decrease the calculating error , it is necessary to divide the integration interval @xmath102 $ ] into some smaller intervals by points @xmath103 , where @xmath104 , assuming @xmath105 , @xmath106",
    ".    then solutions @xmath88 of boundary value problem , , may be formed on corresponding subintervals by solutions @xmath107 of systems of equations    @xmath108 ' = \\gamma_3^{(i ) } \\ , , \\\\ [ \\gamma ^{(i)}_2 ] ' = \\gamma_4^{(i ) } \\ , , \\\\ [ \\gamma ^{(i)}_3]'= k_1 \\gamma_1^{(i ) } - k_2 \\gamma_2^{(i ) } \\ , , \\\\ [ \\gamma ^{(i)}_4]'= k_2 \\gamma_1^{(i ) } + k_1 \\gamma_2^{(i ) } \\ , , \\end{cases}\\ ] ]    where function @xmath86 subscript is a solution number , and its superscript is a subinterval number , @xmath109 .    the solutions @xmath107 of must satisfy boundary conditions and and , besides , some conjugation conditions , which link them at the ends of the subintervals .",
    "having in mind that points @xmath110 of a partition of the integration interval @xmath102 $ ] are arbitrary , we can write the following conjugation conditions :    @xmath111 ' = [ \\gamma_k^{(i+1)}(\\bar{x}_{i},\\omega , q ) ] ' , \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath104 . in this way , solutions @xmath88 of boundary value problem , , are defined as follows :    @xmath112    where @xmath113 $ ] , @xmath109 .",
    "so now it is possible to use the above described technique of solution for all the systems of equations .",
    "then , accounting , we get a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the non - trivial solution of the considered problem :    @xmath114    where @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 can be expressed by recurrence formulas .",
    "again , function @xmath101 from equation is always non - negative .",
    "this fact complicates the numerical determination of the eigenvalues and , in this connection , we have used the method of minimum direct search for determination of the pairs @xmath73 and @xmath38 , which minimize function @xmath101 .",
    "in this paper we have used both asymptotical and numerical methods , successfully solving nonconservative boundary value problems which describe a class of hybrid control dynamical systems appearing in applications of space - engineering design .",
    "we present now some results of numerical calculations for the boundary value problem  as well as their analysis .",
    "first , let us consider the results of calculations by the first asymptotical method . according to and , the first two fundamental frequencies of the nonconservative system are the next ones : @xmath119    now , analysis of condition of vibrations excitation shows that a boundary value of frequency always exists in the considered hybrid system , which separates frequencies domains of stability and non - stability .",
    "the graph of the dependence of such boundary frequency on dimensionless parameter @xmath24 is shown at figure  [ fig : am1:w - nu ] , where the first fundamental frequency is also present ( the horizontal line ) .",
    "the graph is constructed with the following dimensionless parameters : @xmath120 which take place in the real hybrid systems @xcite .    the intersection point in figure",
    "[ fig : am1:w - nu ] corresponds to the value @xmath121 , which is the maximum allowed value : for all greater values of @xmath24 , the natural frequency @xmath122 is in the non - stability domain that corresponds to excitation of vibrations in the system .",
    "as it can be easily seen from figure  [ fig : am1:w - nu ] , at parameters the vibrations will never take place on the second frequency @xmath123 .",
    "it is also possible to calculate the same boundary frequency , using the second asymptotical method . to do this",
    ", we use the condition of equality in .",
    "the results of such calculations at the same parameters support the results in figure  [ fig : am1:w - nu ] .",
    "now , let us also consider , at the same parameters , the results of calculations of the eigenvalues of the nonconservative boundary value problem  by the numerical method .    according with , in figure  [ fig : nm1:q1 ] and figure  [ fig : nm2:q2 ] we present , respectively , the graphs of the dependence of real parts @xmath124 and @xmath125 , of the first two eigenvalues , on dimensionless parameter @xmath24 . according with , the imaginary parts @xmath122 , @xmath123 of the first two eigenvalues are practically independent on parameter @xmath24 , and coincide with the results , obtained by the asymptotical method .",
    "it is clear that the stability domain of the system corresponds to the negative values of real parts @xmath124 and @xmath125 of the eigenvalues , and when they vanish , we have the case of self - excited vibrations .",
    "so , from figure  [ fig : nm2:q2 ] , we can see that vibrations will not be excited at the second frequency .",
    "besides , from figure  [ fig : nm1:q1 ] , it is possible to calculate the value of parameter @xmath24 at which @xmath126 .",
    "this value of @xmath24 coincides , with accuracy @xmath127 , with the value obtained from the intersection point in figure  [ fig : am1:w - nu ] by asymptotical method .",
    "thus , all the results of calculations by the asymptotical and numerical methods coincide with a sufficient accuracy .    , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130    in this way , for each definite hybrid system it is possible to define a character of possible vibrations .",
    "as dimensionless parameter @xmath24 is directly proportional to the feedback coefficient @xmath11 , which may be purposefully changed by application of different feedbacks @xcite , it is possible to change purposefully eigenvalues of the considered nonconservative boundary problem .",
    "this allows to avoid in the system an excitation of undesirable vibrations , including self - excited vibrations .",
