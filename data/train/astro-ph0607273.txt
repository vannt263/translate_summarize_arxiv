    "the galaxy population in the local universe consists broadly of two classes of objects , early and late types , distinguishable by their morphology , broadband colour and star formation rate ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the properties of early - type galaxies are almost independent of the environment @xcite and there is evidence that the properties of late - types are insensitive to the environment too @xcite .",
    "there is also conclusive evidence that this bi - modality exists at least out to @xmath3 , and that the fractions of early and late types are different compared to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite conclude that galaxy bi - modality reflects the two - component nature of galaxies ( bulge - disc ) rather than two distinct galaxy populations .",
    "there are several physical processes related to environment that can be responsible of the observed bi - modality by transforming galaxies from late to early types and by truncating their sfrs .",
    "some of them are typical of cluster environment , such as ram pressure @xcite , galaxy harassment @xcite and interactions with the cluster potential @xcite .",
    "some other processes such as galaxy mergers and interactions should be more common in groups of galaxies where the relative velocities of the galaxies are lower .",
    "another process that increases the fraction of red galaxies in groups or clusters is strangulation @xcite , that consists in the removal of the hot gas reservoir of in - falling galaxies so their star formation halts after their cold gas is consumed .    in the last years , with the advent of large galaxy redshift surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) and the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey @xcite , several authors have studied the relation between different galaxy properties and the environment ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", @xcite found that , at fixed luminosity the fraction of red galaxies is a strong function of projected galaxy density . @xcite and @xcite have proposed a scenario where mergers are driving the bi - modality , with a red population resulting from merger processes , and a blue population that form stars at a rate determined by their internal physical properties . in this scenario , to preserve the gaussian nature of the colour distributions the environmentally triggered transformations from blue to red colours should occur in a short timescale , or at high redshift .",
    "most studies have parametrised environment with the projected density of galaxies brighter than a given luminosity threshold , measured typically using the area containing the 5 - 10th nearest neighbour . as pointed out by @xcite , the physical meaning of this projected density depends on the environment , while it measures local density in clusters , in low density regions a more global density estimate is derived by this measurement .",
    "there are few studies that have investigated how galaxy properties correlate with halo mass using large group catalogues .",
    "@xcite found that the fraction of early type galaxies increases continuously from the lowest to the highest mass groups in the @xcite catalogue constructed from the 100k release of 2dfgrs .",
    "@xcite confirmed this result using an independent group catalogue based in the final release of 2dfgrs .",
    "however , @xcite found no dependence of sfr and morphology on group velocity dispersion , @xmath5 , when analysing galaxies in groups identified in the first data release of sdss .",
    "consistently with this , @xcite found no trend of the fraction of red galaxies with @xmath5 in clusters .",
    "some of the most recent works on the subject agree that galaxy properties and halo mass are indeed correlated .",
    "@xcite analyse the dependence of colour , star formation and morphology on halo mass in a group catalogue constructed from the second data release of sdss using the algorithm by @xcite . by splitting galaxies into early , intermediate and late - types according to their colour and specific star formation rate",
    ", they find that at fixed luminosity , the fraction of early type galaxies is a smooth increasing function of halo mass .",
    "@xcite have shown that colour is the galaxy property that correlates best with group mass using the group catalogue by @xcite constructed from the fourth data release of sdss ( dr4 ; @xcite ) .    for a better understanding of the impact of group environment on galaxy evolution , it is important to trace their redshift evolution . in clusters of galaxies , a strong evolution in the fraction of blue galaxies",
    "was originally detected by @xcite and later by other authors ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "evolution of the fraction of galaxies of different morphological types has also been found in clusters ( e.g @xcite ) .",
    "evolution in groups was reported by @xcite .",
    "they compared a sample of groups photometrically selected in the vicinity of bright radio galaxies at low ( @xmath6 ) and intermediate ( @xmath7 ) redshift and report evolution of the blue galaxy fraction analogous to that observed in clusters . however , field contamination is a significant limitation of photometric data , and it is not clear how the radio selection might bias the sample of groups .",
    "robust evidence of the evolution of galaxies in groups was found by @xcite by comparing an intermediate redshift sample at @xmath8 from the cnoc2 survey @xcite with local groups ( @xmath9 ) in the 2pigg catalogue @xcite .",
    "the authors found that the fraction of passive galaxies is a strong function of environment and luminosity and declines strongly with redshift .",
    "their results provide indications of the effect of different mechanisms acting in high and intermediate density regions .",
    "making use of the large amount of galaxy data made publicly available by the sloan digital sky survey team in their fourth data release , we study in this paper how the bi - modality in the @xmath0 colour distribution of galaxies varies from field galaxies to group galaxies of different masses and seek for possible evolution in the nearby universe @xmath10 .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we describe the sample of galaxies in groups we use ; in section 3 we analyse the dependence on group virial mass of the @xmath0 colour distribution for several luminosity defined subsamples of galaxies , its evolution at low redshift is analysed in section 4 .",
    "we summarise our results and discuss their implications in section 5 .",
    "the samples of galaxies used in this paper are included in the main galaxy sample ( mgs ; @xcite ) of dr4 .",
    "the sample of galaxies in groups was constructed by @xcite .",
    "they identified groups of galaxies in the mgs of dr4 using the same technique as @xcite .",
    "the technique consists in a standard friend - of - friend algorithm for group identification together with a procedure to avoid the artificial merging of smaller systems in high density regions and an iterative method to compute reliable group centre positions .",
    "the resulting group sample includes 14004 galaxy groups with at least 4 members in the area spectroscopically surveyed by dr4 , accounting for a total of 85728 galaxies .",
    "our sample of field galaxies consists of those mgs dr4 galaxies that were not identified as belonging to groups by @xcite .",
    "thus , our field sample includes some galaxies that belong to small groups that were undetected given the characteristics of the group finding procedure .",
    "galaxy magnitudes were corrected for galactic extinction following @xcite , absolute magnitudes were computed assuming @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 and @xmath14corrected using the method of @xcite  ( kcorrect version 4.1 ) .",
    "all magnitudes are in the ab system . for the purpose of this work we use both petrosian and model magnitudes .",
    "since the mgs is defined using petrosian magnitudes , we use them to define volume - limited subsamples of galaxies . for analysing @xmath0 colours of galaxies we use model magnitudes instead , since aperture photometry may include non - negligible poisson and background subtraction uncertainties in the @xmath15band .",
    "the colour distribution of galaxies at a given luminosity is well described by the sum of two gaussian distributions ( e.g. , @xcite ) representing the blue and the red sequences . according to @xcite , at fixed luminosity , the mean colours of both populations are nearly independent of the galaxy surface density . in contrast , the fraction of galaxies in the red population strongly correlates with surface density but not with cluster velocity dispersion .",
    "this seems to be difficult to reconcile with the results by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in order to study in detail the evidence for differences in galaxy evolution in the group group environment and",
    "shed light on the processes governing this evolution , in this section we explore the colour bi - modality of galaxies in groups of different virial masses and compare it to the corresponding colour distribution of field galaxies .    for studying the @xmath0 colour distribution of galaxies in groups and in the field ,",
    "we restrict our samples to @xmath16 .",
    "this choice guarantees a volume limited sample of galaxies down to @xmath17 .",
    "we then divide the galaxies into 5 luminosity bins :    * @xmath18 ; * @xmath19 ; * @xmath20 ; * @xmath21 ;  and * @xmath22 .    in order to characterise the dependence of the distributions on group mass",
    ", we divide each luminosity - defined subsample of galaxies in groups into 3 mass bins according to the parent group virial mass :    * @xmath23 ; * @xmath24  and * @xmath25    for each subsample , we have computed the @xmath0 colour distribution and fitted with the sum of two gaussian functions : @xmath26 where the sub - indexes @xmath27 and @xmath28 stand for ` blue ' and ` red ' sequences , @xmath29 is the number of galaxies in the subsample , and @xmath30 is the colour bin s width .",
    "the fitting procedure consists in a standard levenberg - marquardt method that estimates the 6 best - fitting parameters in equation [ 2gauss ] .",
    "the colour distribution for each subsample and its corresponding best - fitting two - gaussian function are shown in figure [ z0 ] .",
    "we confirm previous findings that a two - gaussian model is a good parametrisation of the observed colour distribution in all cases .",
    "clearly , the colour distribution depends on both luminosity and environment .",
    "it is noticeable that the peak of the red galaxy population becomes more prominent in groups of increasing mass and for brighter galaxies .",
    "another feature that varies among the different subsamples , is the amplitude and position of the blue peak .",
    "it differs significantly between field and groups .",
    "this peak weakens with mass and reddens from fainter to brighter galaxies and from low to high group mass .     as a function of group mass for each luminosity defined subsample of galaxies .",
    "the @xmath31-axis values are the median of the group masses for each mass bin .",
    "left column shows in its three panels the values for the gaussian function that represents the blue population , while right column displays the corresponding values for the red population . in both columns ,",
    "top panels show the amplitudes @xmath32 and @xmath33 , middle panels the widths @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and bottom panels the colours @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "open circles and dotted lines correspond to @xmath38 galaxies , open triangles and short dashed lines to @xmath39 galaxies , filled triangles and long dashed lines to @xmath40 galaxies , open squares and dot - long dashed lines to @xmath41 , galaxies and filled squares and continuous lines to @xmath42 galaxies .",
    "notice the lack of blue population galaxies in the highest luminosity bin .",
    ", width=340 ]     galaxies , open triangles and short dashed lines to @xmath39 galaxies , filled triangles and long dashed lines to @xmath40 galaxies , and open squares and dot - long dashed lines to @xmath41 , galaxies .",
    ", width=340 ]    in figure [ z0mass ] we show the best - fitting parameters corresponding to these distributions as a function of group virial mass .",
    "notice that we do not show the parameters corresponding to the blue sequence for @xmath42 galaxies since this sequence is absent in groups of masses @xmath43 and @xmath44 , as can be seen in figure [ z0 ] .",
    "the parameters trends become clearer in this figure . as a function of group mass and for all luminosities considered here , we find that :    * the amplitude of the blue sequence , @xmath32 , decreases , the width @xmath34 is broadly consistent with no variation , and the mean colour , @xmath36 , reddens ; * on the other hand , the amplitude of the red sequence , @xmath33 , strongly increases , @xmath35 decreases , and the mean colour @xmath37 reddens , except for @xmath42 galaxies in which case it is consistent with no variation with mass .    in figure [ rfm ]",
    "we show the fraction of galaxies in the red sequence as a function of group virial mass , for @xmath45 galaxies .",
    "as pointed out above , the colour distribution of @xmath42 galaxies is consistent with no blue sequence for the higher mass bins .",
    "clearly , the fraction of red galaxies is a growing function of group mass for the remaining luminosities . over the whole range of masses considered here",
    ", the fraction of galaxies in the red sequence grows by @xmath46 for @xmath38 , @xmath47 for @xmath39 , @xmath47 for @xmath40 , and @xmath48 for @xmath41 galaxies .",
    "our findings are in qualitative agreement with the results by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", they disagree with the results by @xcite and @xcite , although these authors consider velocity dispersion instead of mass .",
    "however , unlike @xcite , we do find a dependence of the mean colour of both sequences with mass .",
    "this could be due to the fact that we use @xmath0 colour , instead of @xmath49 , and @xmath50-band flux is a much better indicator of star formation than @xmath51band flux .",
    "also , different ways of splitting galaxies into early and late types could make the difference between @xcite results and ours .",
    "the observed dependence of the mean colour of each sequence on group mass agrees with @xcite results , who find similar changes with local density , particularly for the blue sequence .",
    "we have repeated our analysis by fixing the gaussian widths given their lack of strong variation with mass .",
    "the results are essentially the same , indicating the robustness of our conclusions .",
    "in this section we explore the presence of evolution of galaxy colours at low redshift and its dependence on environment .",
    "we restrict our samples to those luminosities that allow the construction of volume - limited subsamples of galaxies with a number of objects large enough that allow splitting into at least 3 bins in redshift , that , in turn , contain enough objects for a good statistics .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the low redshift evolution of the colour of galaxies brighter than @xmath2 , that is , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 galaxies . for each of these subsamples ,",
    "we have computed the colour distributions within different redshift limits : @xmath52 for @xmath40 galaxies , @xmath53 for @xmath41 , and @xmath1 for the @xmath42 subsample .",
    "that is , we investigate the evolution of @xmath54 galaxies in the last @xmath55 and @xmath56 gyr , respectively . in order to have robust statistics we only use two mass subsamples : the low mass subsample comprising galaxies in groups with virial masses @xmath57 , and a high mass subsample including those galaxies in groups with @xmath58 .",
    "these two mass bins correspond approximately to dividing the sample at the peak of the group virial mass distribution .",
    "we find in all cases that the two - gaussian model is a good description of the colour distribution .",
    "we show the best - fitting parameters as a function of redshift for galaxies in the field , in groups and in the high mass subsample in figures [ bluez ] and [ redz ] . along with the trends found for luminosity and group mass in the previous subsection",
    ", there appear here some interesting trends as a function of redshift .",
    "regarding the blue sequence ( figure [ bluez ] ) , the most significant change is that in massive groups the amplitude increases with redshift .",
    "the trends for @xmath34 are noisy and in most cases consistent with no evolution with the exception of @xmath42 galaxies , for which the sequence gets broader with increasing redshift .",
    "the mean colour @xmath36 evolves with @xmath59 for @xmath40 and @xmath41 galaxies , being bluer in the past .",
    "the evolution with redshift is much stronger for the red sequence ( figure [ redz ] ) .",
    "the amplitude of the red sequence is a decreasing function of redshift , much more prominent in galaxy groups than in the field . in all cases",
    "the red sequence gets broader with redshift , and its mean colour gets slightly bluer .",
    "the colour distribution of galaxies in groups significantly differs from that corresponding to field galaxies for all redshifts considered .",
    "it should be taken into account that an important fraction of red galaxies in field samples are actually galaxies belonging to small groups that might have not been identified by @xcite because some of the other group members are fainter than the limiting apparent magnitude of the sdss spectroscopic survey .",
    "therefore , the actual differences between field and group should be even more significant for the higher redshift bins .",
    "we have tested the stability of our results by restricting the groups to a subsample with at least 6 members .",
    "the analysis of this subsample gives essentially the same results than that of the total group sample indicating the lack of low number statistic biases as well as possible dependences on the number of members .    in figure [ rf ]",
    "we show the fraction of galaxies in the red sequence as a function of redshift .",
    "it is clear that in groups these fractions increase with cosmic time even when we are considering a small redshift range .",
    "we also notice the remarkable different behaviour of field and massive group galaxies . while the former show almost no changes , group galaxies exhibit a very significant decrease of the red population towards higher redshifts .",
    "this result is in agreement with @xcite comparison of nearby groups from the 2pigg catalogue , at @xmath60 , with groups at @xmath61 from the cnoc2 survey .",
    "it is worth emphasising that in this work we have found statistically significant evolution in the recent ( @xmath62gyr ) past , made possible by the improved statistics of the larger number of galaxies in dr4 .    ,",

    "we have used one of the largest sample of groups available , identified in the sdss dr4 by @xcite to study the colour distribution of galaxies in groups , its dependence on luminosity and group mass , and its evolution at low , @xmath63 , redshift .",
    "we have found that , for all subsamples of galaxies in groups analysed , the @xmath0 model colour distribution is well fitted by the sum of two gaussian distributions that can be used to divide the galaxies into a blue and a red population .",
    "the colour distributions strongly depend on galaxy luminosity and on parent group virial mass .",
    "we have also found that the fraction of galaxies in the red sequence is a function of group mass    for galaxies brighter than @xmath64 , we have studied the evolution of the colour distribution at low , @xmath63 , redshift , finding significant evidence of an increase on the fraction of red galaxies with cosmic time in groups in the last @xmath65 gyr . this effect is stronger for groups more massive than @xmath66 , in stark contrast to the lack of evolution observed in field galaxies over the same period .",
    "our results are consistent with the idea that the global evolution of galaxies ( for example the observed decline of the sfr since @xmath3 ; e.g. , @xcite ) takes place primarily in high density , dynamically evolved regions such as groups and clusters .",
    "we have presented evidence that the processes that transform galaxies from late to early types have been more effective in groups of increasing mass than in the field , and that they have been efficiently acting on galaxies in the last @xmath65 gyr .",
    "these findings could be used to constrain semi - analytic of galaxy formation , providing important clues to the mechanisms driving the observed colour evolution . as derived from our work the @xmath0 colour distribution",
    "is well described by the sum of two gaussian functions for the range of galaxy luminosities and host group mass analysed within the redshift range explored . to preserve this form , processes that transform",
    "galaxies should occur in short timescales , as discussed by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in these studies ,",
    "the authors propose that the main process driving this evolution is merging .",
    "groups are probably the best environment for mergers given the high density and the relatively low galaxy velocity dispersion .",
    "the results by @xcite , give additional support to this idea by showing that the characteristic luminosity of galaxies in groups is an increasing function of halo mass and that this behaviour is due to changes in the characteristic luminosity of galaxies in the red sequence .",
    "we conclude that there has been a significant difference in galaxy colour evolution in groups in the last @xmath67gyr .",
    "the observed evolution is stronger in the more massive galaxy groups , where the relative fraction the most luminous galaxies ( @xmath68 ) in the red sequence increases from @xmath69 to @xmath70 , compared to a roughly constant fraction of @xmath71 in the field .",
