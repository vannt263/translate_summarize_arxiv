    "mesoscopic systems are characterized by spatial dimensions smaller than the phase breaking length @xmath4 so that the phase of an electron is not destroyed by inelastic processes . along their optical paths , electrons pick up phases from propagation and scattering . even for negligible dephasing , certain circumstances can lead to an _ averaging _ of these phases , a phenomenon which has been analyzed in connection with localization , see e.g.  refs .  .",
    "it remains however a fundamental task to compare in detail the effects of phase averaging and dephasing . for a noninteracting model system",
    "it was recently shown that a single one - channel dephasing probe gives the same full counting statistics as a single phase - averaging probe.@xcite however , it was noted that this result does no longer hold for several probes , i.e.  phase averaging over many independent phases seems to be fundamentally different from dephasing . in the present paper we address this issue in detail .",
    "we discuss a generic one - dimensional interacting system coupled to two reservoirs with few barriers at arbitrary but fixed positions .",
    "we show that for incommensurate barrier positions an independent average over several phases can be induced by finite temperature . for more than two barriers",
    "we find that phase averaging drastically differs from dephasing and show that the commonly made assumption that barriers with mutual distances larger than the thermal length @xmath5 can be treated independently @xcite ( note that in experiment contacts to leads constitute additional barriers ) does not hold in the absence of dephasing .",
    "this means that even in the high - temperature regime interference effects are still important , as also shown recently for quantum dots in the sequential tunneling regime.@xcite for three strong barriers with individual conductances @xmath0 , we obtain @xmath6 for the total conductance , in drastic contrast to the addition of resistances which follows from dephasing . for an interacting quantum wire ( qw )",
    "this implies power - law scaling of @xmath3 with novel exponents which can be used as an experimental fingerprint for phase averaging .    in section [ sec : noninteracting ]",
    "we introduce a noninteracting model for a quantum wire with barriers which allows a simple discussion of temperature induced phase averaging . in section [ sec : interacting ] we study the influence of temperature induced phase averaging on the scaling beghaviour of interacting quantum wires and propose an experimental setup to distinguish phase averaging from dephasing . while sections [ sec : noninteracting ] and [ sec : interacting ] focus primarily on a wire with three barriers , section [ sec:4barrier ] treats phase averaging for a wire with four barriers .",
    "for a discussion of the basic physical idea consider first the noninteracting case .",
    "we model the qw coupled to leads by an infinite tight - binding chain for spinless electrons at half - filling ( @xmath7 ) @xmath8 with hopping matrix elements equal to 1 ( defining the energy unit ) except for @xmath9 , @xmath10 , where the barriers are situated . without barriers the dispersion relation is @xmath11 with band width @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the momentum and @xmath14 the lattice spacing .",
    "the distance between subsequent barriers is @xmath15 with @xmath16 . we characterize the barriers by their transmission @xmath17 and reflection @xmath18 follows from @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the transmission amplitude .",
    "thus , the effect of temperature is an average of the transmission probability @xmath22 over an energy range @xmath23 .",
    "this is fundamentally different from dephasing which destroys the phase information for each individual path of the electron .",
    "if one takes account of dephasing by summing up the classical probabilities of all paths , one obtains @xmath24 , with @xmath25.@xcite since @xmath26 is proportional to the resistance of a barrier , this gives the classical law of adding up resistances in series .",
    "in contrast , we now show that temperature induced energy averaging leads to completely different results .",
    "since @xmath27 and @xmath28 vary slowly with energy on the scale @xmath29 , temperature averages only over the rapidly varying phases an electron acquires by bouncing back and forth between two subsequent barriers @xmath30 . as @xmath31 depends weakly on energy ,",
    "the change of @xmath32 over the energy range @xmath23 near the fermi energy is given by @xmath33 .",
    "thus , for @xmath34 , @xmath35 is roughly given by @xmath36 .",
    "for all @xmath37 and incommensurate length @xmath38 ( i.e. , @xmath39 is only valid for large coprime integers @xmath40 ) , this implies that the average over energy will cover a representative part of the multidimensional phase space defined by @xmath41 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_averaging ] ) . in this case , temperature induced energy averaging is equivalent to an _ independent _ average over all phases @xmath32 , and we can replace @xmath42 in eq .   by the phase - averaged quantity @xmath43",
    "provided that @xmath44 .",
    "note that this result does not hold for commensurate lengths @xmath38 ( where the path in phase space closes very quickly ; see below ) and becomes less relevant for a large number @xmath45 of barriers ( since @xmath46 has to be chosen too large in order to cover a representative part of the high dimensional phase space ) .",

    "for sufficiently high temperature the line covers a representative part of the plane . ]",

    "phase averaging yields the addition of resistances for two barriers .",
    "in contrast , for three barriers we obtain @xmath57 with @xmath58 . for weak barriers , @xmath59 ,",
    "this gives @xmath60 leading to exponentially small transmission when scaling it up to many barriers , in analogy to ref .  .",
    "for strong barriers , @xmath61 , we obtain the surprising result @xmath62 leading to @xmath1 when inserted in eq .  .",
    "[ fig : nonint_incommens ] shows that the phase - averaged @xmath2 through three barriers at incommensurate positions agrees precisely with the exact one for sufficiently large @xmath63 , whereas summing up the individual resistances is incorrect for all @xmath63 . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : nonint_incommens ] we present the energy dependence of the total transmission probability .",
    "it forms energetically large superstructures , as the height and area of the peaks are very sensitive to the mutual distance of the resonance positions of the left and right dot .",
    "those are roughly given by even ( odd ) multiples of @xmath64 for odd ( even ) @xmath65 .",
    "thus , if @xmath66 is valid only for large coprime integers @xmath67 ( incommensurate case @xcite ) , the mutual energetic distance of left- and right - dot resonance peaks of @xmath22 shifts slowly along the energy axis , leading to a modulation of the peak height and area .",
    "this provides another picture for temperature induced energy averaging : if @xmath63 is large enough to average over a sufficient part of a superstructure , it averages over many mutual distances between left- and right - dot resonances , which is equivalent to phase averaging .     and incommensurate dot length , @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",

    "[ fig : nonint_commens ] ) .",
    "it can be shown that coinciding resonances ( avoided crossings ) give rise to two peaks of the total transmission probability , each one with area @xmath76^{-1 } = { \\mathcal o } \\left ( \\tau^2 \\right)$ ] .",
    "note that while @xmath77 is proportional to the distance of the two peaks , it does not influence their area .",
    "the well - separated peaks can be neglected when calculating the total conductance through the qw because they have a much smaller area of @xmath78 than the coinciding peaks and they are not in great majority ( as @xmath67 are small ) . for @xmath79 , the energy - integral in eq .",
    "averages over the large coinciding peaks . for the total conductance it follows ( see fig .  [",

    "eq .   in obviously inconsistent with summing up the single resistances , and",
    "the total conductance is independent of the strength of the barrier in the middle .",
    "we now turn to the more realistic case of an interacting qw ( luttinger liquid , ll ) on sites @xmath82 by adding a short ranged interaction @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "abrupt contacts to the leads follow if the interaction is chosen to be the same on all sites , @xmath85 . for smooth contacts",
    "@xmath86 rises slowly from zero at the leads to its full value within the wire over roughly @xmath87  sites .",
    "the interaction is treated using the truncated functional renormalization group.@xcite this approach leads to a real and frequency independent self - energy , which then serves as an effective single - particle potential so that eq .",
    "is still applicable .",
    "inelastic processes mediated by the interaction are neglected as they would just contribute subleading corrections .",
    "a single strong impurity in a ll generates a slowly decaying oscillatory effective potential of range @xmath88 which makes the local density of states in the vicinity of a large impurity scale as @xmath89.@xcite the boundary exponent @xmath90 can be computed from the ll parameter @xmath91 which in turn is known from bethe ansatz @xcite , @xmath92 at half - filling . for @xmath93 , as taken in the following , our approach is known to produce the exponent @xmath94 in good agreement with @xmath95.@xcite    if a strong barrier is placed within the interacting part of the qw , the density of states scales with @xmath63 on both sides of the barrier yielding a power - law @xmath96 .",
    "if a strong barrier separates an interacting part of the wire from a noninteracting part as do tunneling barriers to the leads , @xmath97 .",
    "we are interested in possible power laws if three barriers of mixed types are present .    given three barriers in the wire , we find that the effective potential formed at one barrier is not affected by the presence of the other barriers , as long as @xmath98 .",
    "consequently , the scaling law of the transmission probabilities of the individual barriers @xmath99 ( with @xmath100 or @xmath101 depending on the type of the barrier ) is not affected by the presence of the other barriers and thus @xmath102 .",
    "interpreting a barrier and its surrounding oscillations as an effective barrier , we can use eq .   and the picture of two dots in series developed for the noninteracting case .",
    "thus , for incommensurate @xmath38 and sufficiently large @xmath63 , phase averaging as given by eq .   can as well be applied to an interacting wire ( see fig .  [",

    "are shifted a different amount in energy with changing temperature than right - dot resonances ( filled circles ) , an avoided crossing can occur ( arrow ) leading to a drastically enhanced conductance if temperature is low . ]",
    "this implies power - law scaling of @xmath107 where the exponent depends on _ all _ exponents of the individual barriers @xmath108 therefore , combinations of different barriers will produce exponents equal to different integer multiples of @xmath109 . for three barriers within the interacting part of the wire ( @xmath110 ) , eq .",
    "yields @xmath111 .",
    "if one of the three barriers is a contact to a noninteracting lead , it follows @xmath112 .",

    "[ fig : int_incommens_exp ] we show the effect of bulk contacts ( in contrast to end contacts discussed so far ) .",

    "do not change significantly the density of states in the wire @xcite , their contribution to the exponent in eq .",
    "is @xmath116 .",
    "this provides a concrete experimental setup to measure fingerprints of phase averaging by considering a quantum wire with a single impurity contacted by two end contacts and , in situ , also by two scanning tunneling microscopy contacts situated left and right to the impurity but far away from the end contacts compared to @xmath88 . by either measuring transport through the two end contacts , or one end and one bulk contact , or two bulk contact , the situation ( c ) , ( d ) , and ( e ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : int_incommens_exp ] are realized , respectively . if phase averaging dominates different exponents",
    "will be observed , whereas in the case of dominant dephasing the exponent will always be given by the impurity exponent @xmath117.@xcite    an additional feature in fig .",
    "[ fig : int_incommens ] is the occurrence of peaks in @xmath3 at certain moderate temperatures . they arise when left- and right - dot resonances coincide leading to an avoided crossing with a strongly enhanced total transmission .",
    "as the transmission and reflection amplitudes of the single effective barriers depend on @xmath63 via the range @xmath88 of the oscillations of the effective potential , the dot resonances shift energetically with @xmath63 .",
    "the peak shifts occur in two steps , when temperature is lowered from far larger than the bandwidth to zero : the first step occurs when @xmath63 sweeps over the largest part of the band and is due to a renormalization of the hopping in the chain .",
    "the second step occurs when @xmath63 sweeps over the very peak under consideration .",
    "the size in energy of this second step is proportional to the level spacing of the corresponding dot and therefore in general different for left- and right - dot resonances making possible an avoided crossing ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : int_incommens ] ) . at higher temperatures , there are so many transmission resonances contributing to the conductance that the enlargement of single peaks due to their avoided crossing is not visible in the conductance .",
    "the temperature dependence of the dot resonances has also the consequence that only two dots of exactly the same length represent a truly commensurate configuration because only for @xmath118 regularly coinciding left- and right - dot resonances occur at every temperature .",
    "in this special case our data confirms that eq .  , which now reads @xmath119 , is generalizable to interacting qws .",
    "depending on whether the single barriers are within the wire or at the contacts , this means @xmath96 , @xmath120 or a combination of both .",
    "finally we mention the case of four barriers .",
    ".   then leads to @xmath121 where @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 and the arithmetic - geometric mean @xmath125 of @xmath14 and @xmath126 is defined as the limit of the sequence given by @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 . for weak barriers , @xmath59 ,",
    "this gives again the product law @xmath131 .",
    "for strong barriers , @xmath61 , we get @xmath132 the logarithmic factor appearing now causes small deviations from exact power - laws of @xmath3 .",
    "however , as for an increased number of barriers higher temperatures are necessary for phase averaging to become a reasonable approximation , this formula might not be as relevant as in the case of three barriers .",
    "we have compared the effects of phase averaging and dephasing in an one - dimensional mesoscopic system .",
    "investigating the scaling behavior of the conductance we have proposed that the two phenomena can be distinguished experimentally by analyzing different kinds and numbers of barriers .",
    "this is an important issue for the interpretation of past and future experiments , especially due to the fact that also the contacts to the leads form barriers . in cases where phase averaging dominates",
    ", those contact barriers will influence the scaling behavior even if their resistance is lower than the one of barriers within the wire .",
    "this might be connected with still unexplained power - law exponents in transport measurements through carbon nanotubes.@xcite whether phase averaging or dephasing is dominant in these experiments is still an open question and needs further investigations .",
