    "the ( modified ) nonlinear boltzmann equation for the one particle distribution function provides an accurate description of transport phenomena in a low density gas of inelastic hard spheres or disks @xcite .",
    "these particles are often used to model granular fluids @xcite , specially in the rapid flow regime @xcite .",
    "the boltzmann equation does not provide any direct information about correlations and fluctuations in the gas , other that the particle velocity moments .",
    "nevertheless , methods used in the derivation of the boltzmann equation have been extended to obtain kinetic equations for the equal and different time correlations , in the same low density approximation .",
    "the general idea is that in order to obtain these equations the needed approximations are the same as those used to derive the boltzmann equation itself .",
    "one of the earliest and physically more transparent methods to study fluctuations is that of langevin equations .",
    "almost 40 years ago , in a seminal paper bixon and zwanzig @xcite showed how a boltzmann - langevin equation could be constructed by generalizing the reasonings leading to the boltzmann equation for molecular gases .",
    "the latter describes the behavior of the average value of the one - particle distribution function , while the former incorporates the effects of the fluctuations .",
    "as the authors indicated themselves in the paper , the derivation was based on physical intuition and analogy .",
    "a more systematic derivation of the same result , starting from first principles , was given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a second approach to the study of correlations in dilute gases makes use of functional analysis .",
    "its more general result is a kinetic equation for a generating functional at low density , from which all multi - point correlations can be obtained by functional differentiation @xcite .",
    "a closely related general scheme for the study of correlations is the hierarchical method @xcite .",
    "the starting point are hierarchies of coupled equations for the time distribution functions describing the fluctuations and correlations .",
    "then , the hierarchies are closed by using the same kind of approximations as needed to derive the kinetic equation , i.e. the boltzmann equation in the case of dilute gases .",
    "this method has been recently extended to describe fluctuations and correlations of dilute inelastic gases in their simplest state , the homogeneous cooling state ( hcs ) @xcite . as an application ,",
    "the fluctuations of the total energy were studied and a good agreement between theory and simulation results was found @xcite .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to translate the above formalism in terms of kinetic equations for the correlation functions into a langevin equation formulation , i.e. to extend the fluctuating boltzmann equation to the case of inelastic hard spheres or disks .",
    "the relationship between kinetic equations and the fluctuating boltzmann equation has been analyzed in detail in molecular gases @xcite .",
    "one advantage of the langevin formulation is that it is closer to the fluctuating hydrodynamic equations .",
    "actually , the fluctuating boltzmann equation for molecular systems has been shown @xcite to lead to the same langevin equations for the hydrodynamic fields as obtained by landau and lifshitz @xcite using thermodynamic fluctuation theory .",
    "the noise terms in these equations are assumed to be white with second moments determined by the navier - stokes transport coefficients of the fluid .",
    "their expressions are known as fluctuation - dissipation relations of the second kind @xcite .",
    "the derivation of fluctuating hydrodynamic equations from the fluctuating boltzmann equation for inelastic hard particles , will be also addressed here .",
    "attention will be focussed on a particular state , the hcs , and on a specific hydrodynamic field , the transverse component of the velocity .",
    "the main conclusion will be that the fluctuation - dissipation relation for elastic gases can not be directly extrapolated to inelastic ones , but it needs to be significantly modified .",
    "the second moment of the noise is not determined by the navier - stokes shear viscosity .",
    "moreover , the noise can not be assumed to be white .",
    "these theoretical predictions are in qualitative and quantitative agreement with molecular dynamics simulation results",
    ".    the consideration of the hcs does not imply by itself that the results obtained here are not relevant for other states more accesible experimentally .",
    "the hcs plays for inelastic gases a role similar to the equilibrium state for molecular gases . in the case of molecular systems ,",
    "the expressions of the transport coefficients obtained by linearizing around equilibrium are the same as those appearing in the nonlinear navier - stokes equations as predicted by the chapman - enskog method and successfully used in many far from equilibrium problems @xcite .",
    "also , the fluctuation - dissipation relations derived for near - local - equilibrium states in the original landau and lifshitz theory have proven to be accurate for many other hydrodynamic states @xcite .",
    "for dilute gases composed of inelastic hard particles , the equivalence between the transport coefficients obtained by linear perturbations of the hcs and by applying the chapman - enskog procedure has also been established @xcite .",
    "something similar might be expected for the fluctuations and correlations .    in the system",
    "being considered here , the particles move freely and independently between consecutive collisions .",
    "more specifically , they are not coupled to any external energy source or thermal bath , contrary to the driven granular gas models . for these models ,",
    "the linear response to an external perturbation @xcite as well as the validity of the einstein relation @xcite have been investigated by numerical simulations , and some empirical models have been proposed .",
    "it is not evident a direct relation between the free model considered here and the above driven models .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec . [",
    "s2 ] , the kinetic equations for the one - time and two - time correlation functions of a dilute gas in the hcs derived in ref .",
    "@xcite are shortly reviewed .",
    "these equations are translated into an equivalent boltzmann - langevin equation for the one particle distribution function in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] . when written in the appropriate variables , this equation is the linear boltzmann equation to which a fluctuating force term is added , similarly to what happens in molecular elastic gases .",
    "an expression for the second moment of the fluctuating force in terms of the collisional boltzmann kernel is derived . in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] , the fluctuating hydrodynamic fields are defined , and balance equations for them are obtained from the boltzmann - langevin equation .",
    "they involve formal expressions for the fluctuating pressure tensor , the fluctuating heat flux , and the fluctuating cooling rate .",
    "in addition , an intrinsically inelastic fluctuating force shows up in the equation for the energy .    to get a closed description for the hydrodynamic fluctuations ,",
    "expressions for the heat flux , the pressure tensor , and the cooling rate in terms of the fluctuating hydrodynamic fields are needed .",
    "this can be accomplished by means of the chapman - enskog procedure . here",
    "only the case of the transverse component of the velocity field will be considered . as a consequence , only the expression for the non - diagonal elements of the pressure tensor is required .",
    "this is computed in sec .",
    "the final result is a langevin equation , that is the linear macroscopic equation for the transverse velocity field plus a fluctuating force term .",
    "therefore , the structure is similar to what one could expect by extrapolating from the corresponding equation for molecular systems @xcite . nevertheless , the noise term is not white and its second moment is not given by the usual fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "it is verified that the obtained theoretical predictions are in good agreement with molecular dynamics simulation results .",
