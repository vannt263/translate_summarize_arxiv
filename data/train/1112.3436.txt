    "the study of the double strangeness ( @xmath14 ) hypernuclei is of decisive importance for revealing the entire picture of strong interactions among octet baryons . the binding energies and widths of the @xmath5 hypernuclear states",
    "are expected to determine the strength of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 interactions , respectively .",
    "this basic information is key to testing the quark exchange aspect of the strong interaction because long range pion exchange plays essentially a very minor role in the @xmath17 sector .",
    "even though t - channel pion exchange between @xmath5 and nucleon does operate , its strength is quite weak because the @xmath18 coupling is smaller as compared to the @xmath19 coupling  @xcite .",
    "this input is also vital for understanding the multi - strange hadronic or quark matter . since strange quarks",
    "are negatively charged they are preferred in charge neutral dense matter .",
    "thus these studies are of crucial value for investigating the role of strangeness in the equation of state at high density , as probed in the cores of neutron stars  @xcite and in high energy heavy ion collisions at relativistic heavy ion colliders ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory  @xcite , cern  @xcite and fair facility at gsi  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 reaction leads to the transfer of two units of both charge and strangeness to the target nucleus .",
    "thus this reaction is one of the most promising ways of studying the @xmath17 systems such as @xmath5 hypernuclei and a dibaryonic resonance ( @xmath20 ) , which is a near stable six - quark state with spin parity of @xmath21 and isospin 0 @xcite .",
    "several ways have been discussed to approach these systems in the past  @xcite .",
    "many experimental groups have used the @xmath2 reaction on nuclear targets to search for a @xmath20 dibaryonic resonance  @xcite .    as far as @xmath5 hypernuclei are concerned",
    ", there are some hints of their existence from emulsion events  @xcite",
    ". however , no @xmath5 bound state was unambiguously observed in the few experiments performed involving the ( @xmath22 reaction on a @xmath3c target  @xcite because of the limited statistics and detector resolution .",
    "however , in the near future experiments will be performed at the jparc facility in japan to observe the bound states of @xmath5 hypernuclei via the @xmath2 reaction with the best energy resolution of a few mev and with large statistics by using the newly constructed high - resolution spectrometers  @xcite .",
    "the first series of experiments will be performed on a @xmath3c target .",
    "these measurements are of great significance because convincing evidence for the @xmath5 single - particle bound states would yield vital information on @xmath5 single particle potential and the effective @xmath15 interaction .",
    "already , the analysis of the scarce emulsion  @xcite and spectrometer data  @xcite have led to @xmath5-nuclear potentials with depths that differ by about 10 mev from each other .",
    "the @xmath2 reaction implants a @xmath5 hyperon in the nucleus through the elementary process @xmath10 .",
    "the cross sections for the elementary reaction were measured in the 1960s and early 1970s using hydrogen bubble chambers  @xcite .",
    "the total cross - section data from these measurements are tabulated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in a recent study  @xcite",
    ", this reaction was investigated within a single - channel effective lagrangian model where contributions were included from the @xmath23-channel [ see , fig .",
    "1(a ) ] and @xmath24-channel diagrams which have as intermediate states @xmath7 and @xmath8 hyperons together with eight of their three - and four - star resonances with masses up to 2.0 gev [ @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which are represented by @xmath33 and @xmath34 in fig",
    "this reaction is a clean example of a process in which baryon exchange plays the dominant role and the @xmath35-channel meson exchanges are absent , as no meson with @xmath36 is known to exist .",
    "an important observation of that study is that the total cross section of the @xmath10 reaction is dominated by the contributions from the @xmath26 ( with @xmath37 ) resonance intermediate state through both @xmath23- and @xmath24-channel terms .",
    "the region for beam momentum ( @xmath38 ) below 2.0 gev / c was shown to get most contributions from the @xmath23-channel graphs - the @xmath24-channel terms are dominant only in the region @xmath38 > 2.5 gev .",
    "1a ) and @xmath39 b reactions ( fig .",
    "in the latter case the shaded area depicts the optical model interactions in the incoming and outgoing channels . ]    almost all of the previous theoretical investigations of cascade hypernuclear production via @xmath2 reaction on target nuclei @xcite have used the framework of an impulse approximation where the hyperon production dynamics is separated from that of the relative motion in the entrance and outgoing channels .",
    "thus , the hypernuclear production cross section is expressed as a product of the cross section of the elementary cascade production reaction and a term that accounts for the dynamics of the relative motion .",
    "none of these models has attempted to calculate the cross sections of the elementary reaction - they have been extracted from the sparse experimental data .",
    "therefore , the results of these calculations carry over the ambiguities that are involved in the experimental values of the differential cross sections for the elementary reactions .    in this paper , we investigate the production of cascade hypernuclei via the @xmath2 reaction on nuclear targets within an effective lagrangian model  @xcite , which is similar to that used in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the elementary production reaction , @xmath10 .",
    "we consider only the @xmath23-channel production diagrams ( see fig .",
    "1b ) as we are interested in the region where @xmath38 lies below 2 gev / c .",
    "the model retains the full field theoretic structure of the interaction vertices and treats baryons as dirac particles .",
    "the initial state interaction of the incoming @xmath9 with a bound target proton leads to excitation of intermediate @xmath7 and @xmath8 resonant states , which propagate and subsequently decay into a @xmath12 hyperon that gets captured into one of the nuclear orbits , while the other decay product , the @xmath40 goes out . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that six intermediate resonant states , @xmath7 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath28 , @xmath8 , and @xmath30 , make the most significant contributions to the cross sections of the elementary process . therefore , in our present study the amplitudes corresponding to these six resonant states have been considered .",
    "the @xmath12 bound state spinors have been calculated in the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model as well as in a phenomenological model where they are obtained by solving the dirac equation with scalar and vector fields having a woods - saxon ( ws ) radial form . in the latter case , with a set of radius and diffuseness parameters , the depths of these fields",
    "are searched to reproduce the binding energy ( be ) of a given state .",
    "since the experimental values of the bes for the @xmath12 bound states are as yet unknown , we have adopted the corresponding qmc model predictions ( as shown in table 1 ) in our search procedure for these states .",
    "furthermore , the scalar and vector fields are assumed to have the same geometry .",
    "it should be noted that the depths of the potential fields in such a model are dependent on the adopted radius ( @xmath41 ) and diffuseness ( @xmath42 ) parameters but there is no certain way of fixing them .",
    "nevertheless , using same @xmath41 for all the states may make the search for the potential depths too restrictive .",
    "some authors have used the root mean square radius ( rms ) of a given state to fix the @xmath41 parameter ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "however , such a procedure can not be applied for the @xmath5 bound states at this stage due to the lack of any experimental information about them . with these constraints , we show in table 1 the resulting parameters associated with the scalar and vector fields of the phenomenological model for @xmath12 bound and proton hole states for the two target nuclei . in this table",
    "the qmc predictions for the be of the proton hole states are also shown . however , in the search procedure for these states the experimental values of the bes ( given within the brackets ) have been used .",

    "parameters were 0.983 fm , and 0.606 fm , respectively for both vector and scalar potentials .",
    "the binding energies ( bes ) of the @xmath12 states were taken from the predictions of the qmc model .",
    "the qmc bes for the proton hole states are also shown together with the corresponding experimental values ( given within the brackets ) . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we have chosen the reactions @xmath3c@xmath43be and @xmath4si@xmath44 mg for the first application of our model .",
    "the reaction on the @xmath3c target is billed as the `` day one '' experiment at the jparc facility .",
    "the thresholds for these reactions are about 0.761 gev / c and 0.750 gev / c , respectively and the momentum transfers involved at 0@xmath45 , vary between 1.8 - 2.9 @xmath46 . the initial states in both the cases are doubly closed systems .",
    "the qmc model predicts only one bound state for the @xmath0be hypernucleus with the @xmath12 hyperon being in a 1@xmath47 state with a binding energy as shown in table 1 . for the @xmath1 mg case however , three distinct bound @xmath12 states with configurations 1@xmath47 , 1@xmath48 and 1@xmath49",
    "have been predicted .",
    "the binding energies of these states are shown in table 1 .",
    "it is evident that for this nucleus 1@xmath48 and 1@xmath49 states are almost degenerate .",
    "this reflects the fact that the @xmath5-nucleus spin - orbit potential is weak .",
    "this is due to the fact that since the corresponding total potential depth is small , the gradient of this potential that contributes to the spin - orbit force is also small .    in case of the @xmath3c target ,",
    "the @xmath12 hyperon in a 1@xmath47 state can populate 1@xmath50 and 2@xmath50 states of the hypernucleus corresponding to the particle - hole configuration @xmath51 .",
    "the states populated for the @xmath1 mg hypernucleus are [ 2@xmath52 , 3@xmath52 ] , [ 1@xmath50 , 2@xmath50 , 3@xmath50 , 4@xmath50 ] , and [ @xmath55 , @xmath56 corresponding to the configurations @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , respectively . in fig .  5 , we have shown results for populating the hypernuclear state with maximum spin of natural parity for each configuration .",
    "the unnatural parity states are very weakly excited due to the vanishingly small spin - flip amplitudes for this reaction ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for an extensive discussion on this point ) . however , for the @xmath1mg(@xmath60 ) case , the results shown are the sum of the cross sections obtained with both @xmath58 and @xmath61 particle - hole configurations .",
    "the latter contributes substantially ( up to about 75@xmath62 within our model ) to the excitation of this state .    in fig .  5a",
    ", the 0@xmath45 differential cross sections are shown as a function of the beam momentum that are obtained by using @xmath12 bound state spinors calculated within the qmc as well as the phenomenological model for the reactions @xmath3c@xmath43be and @xmath4si@xmath44 mg .",
    "the configurations of the final hypernuclear states are as described in the figure caption . in the calculations of our reaction amplitudes ,",
    "the relative motions of @xmath9 and @xmath40 mesons in the initial and final channels , respectively are described by plane waves .",
    "the distortion effects , which primarily describe the absorption of the incoming @xmath9 , are however , included by introducing factors that reduce the magnitudes of the cross sections .",
    "these factors are taken to be 2.8 and 5.0 for @xmath3c and @xmath4si targets , respectively as suggested in ref .",
    "this necessarily assumes that shapes of the angular distributions are not affected by the distortion effects .",
    "this aspect will be further investigated in a future study .",
    "we see that the qmc model cross sections are larger than those obtained by using the phenomenological model by about 10 - 15@xmath62 in all the cases .",
    "this reflects the fact that in the region of momentum transfers relevant to these reactions both the upper and the lower components of the qmc spinors are higher in magnitude than the corresponding phenomenological ones .",
    "an important observation in fig .",
    "5a is that for both the hypernuclear production reactions , the cross sections peak at @xmath38 around 1.0 gev / c , which is about 0.25 - 0.26 gev / c above the production thresholds of the two reactions .",
    "interestingly , it is not too different from the case of the elementary @xmath12 production reaction where the peaks of the total cross section as well as the zero degree differential cross section occur at about 0.35 - 0.40 gev / c above the corresponding production threshold ( see figa .  3a and 4 ) .",
    "furthermore , the magnitudes of the cross sections near the peak position are in excess of 1 @xmath63 .",
    "it is important in this context to note that the magnitude of our cross section for a @xmath3c target at a beam momentum of 1.6 gev / c is similar to that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite within an impulse approximation model .",
    "moreover , our cross sections at 1.8 gev / c also are very close those of ref .",
    "@xcite for both the targets . however , we fail to corroborate the results of ref .",
    "@xcite where cross sections were shown to peak for @xmath38 around 1.8 gev / c .",
    "it is quite probable that the distortion effects are dependent on the beam momenta and may be relatively stronger at lower values of @xmath38 .",
    "nevertheless , this is unlikely to lead to such a large shift in the peak position . in any case",
    ", this effect was not considered in ref .",
    "@xcite also .",
    "there may be a need to re - examine the beam momentum dependence of the zero degree differential cross section in order to understand this different .    in fig  5b",
    ", we note that the contribution from the @xmath26 intermediate state dominates the total cross sections over the entire regime of @xmath38 values .",
    "this is similar to that noted in the case of the elementary @xmath12 production reaction .",
    "the @xmath25 , and @xmath30 states make noticeable contributions only for @xmath38 very close to the production threshold .",
    "other resonances contribute very weakly .",
    "of course , our results are quite dependent on the ccs of various vertices , which are somewhat uncertain .",
    "nevertheless , the respective cross sections shown in this figure are robust .",
    "first of all these ccs provide a good description of the total as well a differential cross sections of the elementary @xmath12 production reaction .",
    "secondly there is very little scope for increasing further the individual contributions of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 intermediate states , because the ccs of the corresponding vertices used by us are already larger than their upper limits suggested in the literature .",
    "furthermore , the contributions of other resonances are too weak and even have the wrong @xmath38 dependence . therefore , the final results are unlikely to be affected too much by the known uncertainties in the corresponding ccs .",
    "in summary , in this paper the cascade hypernuclear production reactions @xmath3c(@xmath64be , and @xmath4si(@xmath65 mg have been studied within an effective lagrangian model , using the proton hole and @xmath12 bound state spinors derived from the latest quark - meson coupling model .",
    "this is for the first time that the quark degrees of freedom have been explicitly invoked in the description of such reactions .",
    "we have considered the excitation of altogether six @xmath7 and @xmath8 hyperon resonance intermediate states in the initial collision of the @xmath9 meson with a target proton .",
    "these states subsequently propagate and decay into a @xmath12 hyperon and a @xmath40 meson .",
    "the hyperon gets captured in one of the nuclear orbits , while the meson goes out .",
    "we constrain the coupling constants at the resonance vertices by describing both the total and the differential cross sections of the elementary @xmath66 reaction within a similar model .",
    "we have also performed calculations with the spinors obtained by solving the dirac equation with vector and scalar potential fields having woods - saxon shapes ( the phenomenological model ) .",
    "their depths are fitted to the binding energies of the respective states ( qmc model values for the @xmath12 particle states and experimental values for the proton hole states ) for a given set of geometry parameters which are taken to be the same for the two fields .",
    "while for @xmath0be hypernucleus the shapes of the qmc fields are similar to those of the phenomenological model , the two differ considerably in the case of @xmath1 mg . for the cases studied in this paper ,",
    "the hypernuclear production cross sections calculated with the qmc @xmath12 spinors are found to differ only slightly from those obtained within the phenomenological ( the former being about 10 - 15@xmath62 higher in magnitude than the later ) .",
    "the distortion effects are included by introducing reduction factors to the cross sections taken from the previous studies of this reaction .",
    "the zero degree differential cross sections for the @xmath12 hypernuclear production reactions on the two targets considered here , have peaks around the beam momentum of 1.0 gev / c within both the qmc and the phenomenological models .",
    "this peak momentum is above the corresponding production threshold by almost the same amount as the position of the maximum in the elementary total as well as zero degree differential cross sections lies away from its respective threshold .",
    "the peak cross sections are in excess of 1 @xmath63 .",
    "furthermore , the total hypernuclear production cross sections are dominated by the contributions from the @xmath26 ( @xmath67 ) resonance intermediate state which is similar to the case of the elementary @xmath12 production reaction .",
    "other resonances make noticeable contributions only at beam momenta close to the production threshold of the reaction .",
    "it is desirable to perform measurements for the differential cross sections of the elementary @xmath12 production reaction in a wide beam momentum range .",
