    "the undistorted field of view of a given vlbi data set is usually limited by two main effects : bandwidth smearing and time - average smearing @xcite",
    ". the narrower the individual frequency channels and the smaller the integration time , the larger the unaberrated field of view .",
    "data generated by vlbi correlators are comprised of a set of measurements of the complex visibility as a function of frequency ( or delay ) and time .",
    "most continuum vlbi data sets are delivered to the astronomer with relatively narrow frequency channels ( @xmath1  mhz ) and short integration times ( @xmath2  secs ) .",
    "for example , a typical @xmath3  cm evn data set , in its original form , boasts a field - of - view , @xmath4 , in excess of @xmath5  arcminute .",
    "the same evn data set , having for example being averaged in frequency over @xmath6  mhz , has a field - of - view of @xmath7 milliarcseconds ( mas ) .",
    "this reduction in the field - of - view by a factor in excess of two orders of magnitude is often considered to be unimportant .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show , by illustration , that this presumption may no longer be valid .    )",
    "we also detect compact structure in the arcsec - scale jet ( previously labelled in vla maps of the source as features `` jet '' and `` c '' . ]",
    "in the early 1980s , the off - line computer resources available to most astronomers were ill - equipped to deal with extremely large and cumbersome vlbi data sets .",
    "not surprisingly , one of the major goals of vlbi _ data reduction _ was to severely average continuum data at the earliest possible stage in the analysis process ( as soon as fringe - fitting corrections had been applied ) .",
    "today , the processing power and data storage volumes enjoyed by the vast majority of vlbi astronomers is @xmath2 orders of magnitude greater than the shared systems used previously .",
    "nevertheless , the custom of excessive data averaging continues .",
    "this practice severely limits the natural field of view of vlbi images , and is often inappropriate - especially in the era of high sensitivity observations .      in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we present a @xmath8  cm evn - only map of the gravitational lens , 0957 + 561  a , b .",
    "the data were calibrated in the usual manner . to avoid bandwidth smearing ,",
    "the data were held in the form of 28 independent but contiguous 2 mhz channels .",
    "the data were averaged in time in a baseline dependent manner with integration times ranging from 2.5 seconds ( on the longest projected baselines ) to 30 seconds ( on the shortest projected baselines ) .",
    "[ fig1 ] clearly shows the two main , compact components , 0957 + 561  a , b and a very faint compact source known as g@xmath9 , lying about 1 arcsec to the north of b. all three components have been detected by previous vlbi campaigns .",
    "however , the real excitement relates to the fact that we have detected and imaged two low brightness temperature features ( @xmath10 k ) , that are associated with compact regions or hot - spots in the singly imaged arc - second scale jet that dominates vla maps of this source .",
    "there must be many more cases where similar low surface brightness emission goes undetected , simply because a wide - field approach to the data analysis is not pursued .",
    "vlbi observations of such emission could improve our understanding of large - scale jet physics , distinguishing between various hot - spot models and allowing a comparison between the properties of the jet ( e.g. flow velocity ) and the intergalactic medium on pc and kpc scales .",
    "a wide - field approach has also been applied by @xcite to @xmath3  cm evn observations of the starburst galaxy m82 .",
    "previous vlbi observations had focussed on the brightest snr ( 41.95 + 575 ) , but by following a wide - field approach to the data analysis @xcite have been able to generate exquisite images of 4 other compact snr in the field , of which the faintest has a peak flux of @xmath11  mjy / beam .",
    "a sub - section of the entire 1 arcminute field is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . @xcite",
    "have also re - analysed `` vintage '' evn data of m82 from epoch 1986 . by employing a wide - field approach to the re - analysis",
    "they have been able to measure expansion rates for one of the snr and place upper - limits on two others .",
    "this work is a superb example of the type of information `` gain '' one can easily acquire through the general application of wide - field techniques to vlbi data .",
    "the advances in vlbi hardware described elsewhere in this volume suggest that for a global vlbi array r.m.s .",
    "noise levels of @xmath12jy / beam will be attainable by the end of the millennium .",
    "looking further ahead ( 10 - 15 years ) there is every reason to believe that @xmath13jy / beam noise levels will be achievable . at this level of sensitivity , the radio sky becomes a very crowded place . at the @xmath0jy level one may expect to encounter 1 source",
    "every few arcseconds ( see @xcite ) . we can expect to reach these levels of sensitivity within the next 10 - 20 years ,",
    "by which time wide - field vlbi imaging may have evolved into a standard vlbi processing route in order to avoid source confusion . even at the level of a few mjy",
    "a wide - field approach may pay dividends .",
    "@xcite have embarked on a survey of faint mjy sources located within a few degrees of a bright , compact radio source , 1156 + 295 .",
    "two of the faint sources surveyed are separated by only a few arcminutes on the sky . even although the observations had not been set up with wide - field imaging specifically in mind , it was still possible to produce tapered images of both sources simultaneously from a single @xmath14  cm global vlbi data set ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "we note that this wide - field approach permits a very _ direct _ measurement of the relative astrometric positions of radio sources in the same undistorted field of view .",
    "currently the main limits on wide - field imaging are set by the maximum data rate that can be generated by vlbi correlators . in other words ,",
    "the limitation is exactly the reverse of the situation in the early 1980 s , where the bottleneck was associated with off - line data processing facilities .",
    "another restriction is the size of the primary beam of the larger vlbi antennas , especially phased arrays ( e.g. wsrt & vla@xmath15 ) . in this case",
    "at least , `` small is beautiful '' .",
    "this latter point should be borne in mind when the next generation of large telescope arrays are being designed ( e.g. ska ) , especially with regard to their possible incorporation within existing vlbi networks ."
