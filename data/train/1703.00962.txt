    "coherent diffraction imaging ( cdi ) is a promising technology for obtaining the complex transmission function of a specimen from the recorded diffraction intensity . as a lens - free technique",
    ", cdi can bypass the resolution limits imposed by the poor focusing optics available at short wavelengths @xcite and can theoretically reach the diffraction - limited resolution . with x - ray and high - energy electrons ,",
    "a resolution of nanometers or angstroms can be achieved ; thus , cdi is becoming an important tool in material and biological sciences @xcite . because the performance of traditional cdi algorithms is not very satisfying with regard to convergence , accuracy , and reliability ,",
    "several improved cdi methods have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the ptychographic iterative engine ( pie ) @xcite is a scanning version of the cdi technique where the specimen is scanned through a localized illumination beam to a grid of positions and the resulting diffraction patterns are recorded . using an iterative scheme with a proper overlapping ratio between two adjacent scanning positions , the modulus and phase of the transmission functions of the specimen and the illumination beam",
    "can be reconstructed accurately and rapidly @xcite . in theory , pie can easily generate images with a resolution only limited by the numerical aperture of the detector ; however , in practice , the resolution is affected by the flaws of the imaging system , especially for imaging with x - ray and electron beams .",
    "the coherence of synchrotron radiation sources is not as good as that of a laser beam and has been proven to be the largest barrier for pie to reach the theoretical diffraction - limited resolution @xcite .",
    "several algorithms have been investigated to improve the image quality of pie with partially coherent illumination @xcite .",
    "although these methods require complete or partial prior knowledge of the properties of illumination or time - consuming computation and may slightly compromise the spatial resolution , the quality of the reconstruction can be distinctively improved in many cases .",
    "furthermore , the recently developed technique of fourier ptychography has potential to avoid the influence of the incoherence for achieving high - quality reconstruction @xcite .",
    "another factor that limits the practical resolution of pie is the instability of the imaging system , including the vibration of the mechanical scanning system , the tiny pointing - direction change , and the transverse shifting of the radiation beam @xcite .",
    "because the wavelengths of the x - ray and the electron beams are much smaller than 1 nm , the tiny departure of the illumination beam from the right position and direction can generate obvious errors in the final reconstruction .",
    "numerous methods have been proposed to efficiently correct the low - frequency vibration with a period far longer than the exposure time of the detector @xcite .",
    "however , there is no ideal method for effectively handling the high - frequency vibration of the experimental system , which makes the recorded diffraction intensity a summation of many diffraction intensities formed by the changing illumination during the exposure of the detector @xcite .",
    "although the influence of the high - frequency vibration can be treated as a type of incoherence of the illumination , the aforementioned methods @xcite require complete or partial prior knowledge of the properties of vibration - including the frequencies and amplitude - or massive data processing .",
    "however , in practice , the parameters of the vibration of the whole imaging system are difficult to measure in real time . to deal with the image - quality degradation induced by the setup instability",
    ", we must examine its influence on the recorded data and the final reconstruction and then develop a method to circumvent this problem .    in this study",
    ", we mathematically analyze how the recorded diffraction patterns and the final reconstruction are blurred by the instability of the imaging system and then propose a simple numerical method for enhancing the lost high - frequency components .",
    "the proposed method does not require any prior knowledge regarding the characteristics of the high - frequency vibration of the imaging system and can be extended to other cdi methods using x - ray and electron beams to solve the problems related to imaging - system instability .",
    "in the pie method , the specimen @xmath0 is fixed on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) translation stage and illuminated by a localized probe @xmath1 . assuming that the specimen is sufficiently thin , the exiting wave from the specimen is @xmath2 , and the recorded diffraction intensity is @xmath3|^2 $ ] in most experiments with short - wavelength sources , where @xmath4 is the reciprocal coordinate with respect to the real space coordinate @xmath5 in the specimen plane , and @xmath6 denotes the position of the specimen during the raster scanning . with the recorded diffraction patterns , the complex amplitudes of the specimen and the probe can be reconstructed .",
    "the flowchart of the reconstruction process of pie is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] , and a detailed description is found in the literature @xcite .      in the pie algorithm ,",
    "the illumination probe is assumed to be absolutely static during the data acquisition ; however , its direction and position change continually within a small range with respect to the specimen and detector owing to the instability of the imaging system . in most cases , the direction and position of the illumination beam change simultaneously during the exposure of the detector , but for simplicity , we analyze them separately to determine how the recorded data are influenced mathematically and then consider their combined effects .    according to the principles of fourier optics",
    ", any illumination beam can be decomposed into a series of spherical waves of different strengths ; thus , we can assume a spherical illuminating probe without a loss of generality .",
    "the spherical illumination is expressed in fourier form as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the wavelength of the probe , and @xmath9 is the distance between the focal spot of the probe and the specimen , and @xmath10 is determined by the numerical aperture of the illuminating optics . for a short wavelength or in the far field ,",
    "the diffraction distribution in the detector plane is the fourier transform of the wave exiting the specimen .",
    "the complex amplitude of the diffraction pattern in the detector plane can be expressed as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the fourier transform of the transmission function of the specimen .",

    "when considering the pointing instability of the imaging system , the illumination beam tilted an angle of @xmath26 can be expressed as , @xmath27 so the fourier transform of the probe is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 .",
    "the recorded intensity with tilted illumination becomes    @xmath30    assuming that the vibration in the pointing direction of the illumination beam follows the normal distribution @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a constant related to the vibrating properties of the imaging system .",

    "eq.(12 ) can be approximated as @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "clearly , the instability of the illumination beam during the exposure of the detector leads to the loss of high - frequency components of the diffraction intensity , and the contrast of the interference fringes is differently suppressed depending on their frequency . as reported in the literature @xcite , change in the contrast of the diffraction patterns leads to mathematical ambiguity and",
    "generates errors in the final reconstruction .      at first glance",
    ", it appears that the fourier component of the ideal diffraction pattern can be obtained by dividing @xmath48 to the @xmath49 by each possible @xmath50 until a satisfactory reconstruction is achieved .",
    "however , because this operation can seriously amplify the errors or noise , and the expired resolution improvement can be submerged by them , it can not be adopted in practice .    in the proposed method ,",
