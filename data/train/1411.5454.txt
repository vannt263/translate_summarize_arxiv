    "wormholes are spacetime structures which connect two different universes or two points of our universe .",
    "m.  morris and k.  thorne have pioneered qualitative study for static spherically symmetric wormholes which are two - way traversable and discussed the traversable conditions in  .",
    "the most difficult requirement for satisfying the traversable conditions is an exotic matter which violates the null or weak energy condition . in general relativity ,",
    "morris and thorne s static spherically symmetric traversable wormholes need the stress - energy tensor that violates the energy condition at their throat .",

    "an another class of traversable wormholes has been found by m.  visser .",
    "this class of wormholes can be obtained by a `` cut - and - paste '' procedure  @xcite and such structures are called _ thin shell _ wormholes ( tsws ) .",
    "e.  poisson and m.  visser first presented stability analysis for spherical perturbations around such tsws , and found that there are stable configurations according to the equation of state of an exotic matter residing on the throats  . the work of poisson and visser has been extended in different directions ; charged tsws  @xcite , tsws constructed by a couple of schwarzschild spacetimes of different masses and tsws with a cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "tsws in cylindrically symmetric spacetimes have also been studied  @xcite .",
    "published a paper about stability for generic static and spherically symmetric tsws  @xcite .",
    "dias and lemos studied stability in higher dimensional einstein gravity  .",
    "pure tension branes , whether the tension is positive or negative , have particular interest because they have lorentz invariance and have no intrinsic dynamical degrees of freedom . in the context of stability ,",
    "pure negative tension branes have no intrinsic instability by their own , although they violate the weak energy condition .",
    "this is in contrast with the ellis wormholes , for which a phantom scalar field is assumed as a matter content and it suffers the so - called ghost instability because of the kinetic term of a wrong sign  @xcite .",
    "the construction of traversable wormholes by using negative tension branes have first been proposed by c.  barcel and m.  visser .",
    "they analyzed dynamics of spherically symmetric traversable wormholes obtained by operating the cut - and - paste procedure for negative tension 2-branes ( three dimensional timelike singular hypersurface ) in four dimensional spacetimes .",
    "they found stable brane wormholes constructed by pasting a couple of reissner - nordstrm-(anti ) de sitter spacetimes . in their work ,",
    "the charge is essential to sustain such wormholes . and in most cases , a negative cosmological constant tends to make the black hole horizons smaller .",
    "however , in exceptional cases , one can obtain wormholes with a vanishing cosmological constant , if the absolute value of the charge satisfies a certain condition .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate negative tension branes as thin shell wormholes in spherical , planar ( or cylindrical ) and hyperbolic symmetries in @xmath0 dimensional einstein gravity with an electromagnetic field and a cosmological constant in bulk spacetimes . in spherical geometry , we find the higher dimensional counterpart of barcel and visser s wormholes which are stable against spherically symmetric perturbations . as the number of dimensions increases , larger charge is allowed to construct such stable wormholes without a cosmological constant . not only in spherical geometry , but also in planar and hyperbolic geometries , we find static wormholes which are stable against perturbations preserving symmetries .",

    "<S> we investigate negative tension branes as stable thin shell wormholes in reissner - nordstrm-(anti ) de sitter spacetimes in @xmath0 dimensional einstein gravity . imposing z2 symmetry , we construct and classify traversable static thin shell wormholes in spherical , planar ( or cylindrical ) and hyperbolic symmetries . in spherical geometry , we find the higher dimensional counterpart of barcel and visser s wormholes , which are stable against spherically symmetric perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> we also find the classes of thin shell wormholes in planar and hyperbolic symmetries with a negative cosmological constant , which are stable against perturbations preserving symmetries . in most cases , </S>",
    "<S> stable wormholes are found with the combination of an electric charge and a negative cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> however , as special cases , we find stable wormholes even with vanishing cosmological constant in spherical symmetry and with vanishing electric charge in hyperbolic symmetry . </S>"
