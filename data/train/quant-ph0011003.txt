    "when the radiation field is described classically and spontaneous emission is neglected in comparison to induced emission , the steady - state linewidth of an ideal single - mode laser , i. e. of a laser with a perfectly stabilized classical intensity , has the shape of a @xmath0-function .",
    "this is due to the fact that the cavity losses are exactly compensated for by the gain and , as a result , the field in the resonator remains constant . from a fully quantized description of the electromagnetic field",
    ", however , it follows that the laser linewidth can not be smaller than a certain quantum limit , related to the well - known schawlow - townes linewidth , which is inversely proportional to the laser intensity @xcite .",
    "this limit has been studied extensively in the past decades ( see refs . @xcite and references therein ) . in view of the importance of stable coherent signals for various high - precision measurements and because of an ongoing interest in fundamental problems of quantum optics , renewed attention has been paid recently to the quantum limitation of the laser linewidth .",
    "the investigations have been extended to cover bad - cavity lasers @xcite , lasers without inversion @xcite , and a chaotic laser cavity @xcite .",
    "different systems have been devised in this context to reduce the quantum limit of the linewidth by means of correlated spontaneous emission schemes @xcite .",
    "recently even theoretical models for light amplification without stimulated emission have been investigated in order to obtain a reduced ultimate quantum limit of the laser linewidth @xcite .",
    "the quantum - limited laser linewidth is also called the intrinsic or natural linewidth of the laser .",
    "its origin , like the origin of the microscopic intensity fluctuations , lies in the fact that in the stationary regime of operation the balance between the gain and loss processes sustains a constant average field only but , due to the quantum nature of these processes , fluctuations of the field around its mean are induced on a microscopic scale .",
    "we note that the resonator losses are caused by the outcoupling of the field through the output mirror as well as by any additional linear damping process such as absorption . for good - cavity lasers the combined effect of these losses",
    "can be described by a single cavity - damping constant @xmath1 that is the sum of the constants referring to the individual processes .",
    "the usual treatment @xcite of the intrinsic laser linewidth rests on the approximation that the linewidth arises from fluctuations of the phase of the field described by phase diffusion .    in this paper",
    "we rely on the scully - lamb model @xcite of the laser since it is applicable for an arbitrary strong saturation of the lasing atomic transition . neglecting intensity fluctuations ,",
    "a simple analytic expression for the linewidth has been derived in this model by means of different methods @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the intrinsic laser linewidth can be determined exactly by numerically calculating the first - order correlation function of the field and performing the fourier transform of the latter .",
    "thus both the effects of fluctuations of the phase of the field and of its amplitude , or intensity , respectively , are implicitly taken into account .",
    "investigations of this kind have been performed by n. lu @xcite who started from the scully - lamb master equation @xcite and found numerically that near threshold the intrinsic laser linewidth is up to twice as large as that given by the phase - diffusion coefficient at the mean photon number .    in the present contribution",
    "we derive an analytical expression for the quantum - limited laser linewidth by means of investigating the two - time first - order correlations of the field .",
    "the treatment is restricted to single - mode lasers in the good - cavity limit , i. e. we make the usual assumption that the cavity damping time @xmath2 is long in comparison to all other relevant time scales .",
    "this ensures that the time dependence of the polarization and population inversion of the gain medium can be adiabatically eliminated and the scully - lamb model of the laser can be applied .",
    "our approximation scheme is an extension of an analytical method developed previously by one of the authors for calculating photon - number variances @xcite .",
    "it makes use of the fact that the photon - number distribution of the laser radiation is strongly peaked at a large mean photon number .",
    "therefore it is not necessary to study the density - matrix elements of the field in detail but it suffices to directly evaluate the expectation values and correlation functions of interest , in the approximation of small fluctuations .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the overall losses of the field mode are supposed to be due to the coupling of the cavity field to the environment , modeled by a reservoir in thermal equilibrium .",

    "in the following we shall discuss the reasons for the discrepancy between our result and the standard one in more detail .",
    "for this purpose , we first consider the different approximation methods that are employed in the literature for the derivation of eq .",

    "the exact evolution equation for the quasi - probability density @xmath135 contains derivatives with respect to @xmath15 and @xmath136 to all orders @xcite .",
    "this is due to the nonlinearity of the underlying master equation , which is revealed by the denominators in eqs .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) . in the standard treatment",
    "it is assumed that @xmath133 does not change along the radial coordinate , corresponding to a neglect of intensity fluctuations , and that only derivatives up to second order have to be taken into account .",
    "the latter assumption is necessary to ensure phase diffusion , but it becomes less and less justifiable as gain saturation , hence nonlinearity of the laser equations , increases . in this case the simple phase diffusion model can no longer be applied .",
    "in addition , mixed terms also become important in the evolution equation for @xmath133 , which are products of a differential operator acting on the amplitude @xmath15 and another one acting on the phase .",
    "these , in turn , lead to cross correlations between the fluctuations of the intensity and the phase .    in the frame of the photon - number representation of the density operator ,",
    "the standard result has been derived by applying the quantum fluctuation - regression theorem and approximately investigating the decay of an initial value of the field instead of the two - time correlation function .",
    "this is done by means of determining the lowest eigenvalue that characterizes a single decay rate for all non - diagonal density - matrix elements @xmath137 @xcite . in a more precise treatment",
    "a single decay rate would have to be determined for the quantities @xmath138 @xcite , since the average field follows from performing the sum over these quantities . moreover , with increasing above - threshold ratio the influence of the nonlinearity also increases and therefore the quantum fluctuation - regression theorem can not be applied anymore , in general @xcite .",
    "with respect to the heisenberg - langevin approach , we mention that a nonlinear @xmath139-number langevin equation can be derived for the complex field amplitude @xmath134 .",
    "the coupling of the fluctuations of the real amplitude @xmath15 and the phase @xmath136 is clearly obvious from this langevin equation .",
    "the derivation of the phase diffusion result , eq .",
    "( [ 31 ] ) , rests on implicitly making a factorization assumption for expectation values containing the complex field amplitudes in the denominator and their noise operators in the nominator @xcite . because of",
    "the intensity fluctuations near threshold , and because of the nonlinearity due to gain saturation far above threshold , it would be extremely difficult to go beyond this approximation .",
    "we finally conclude that the laser linewidth can not be explained satisfactorily with the help of the simple assumption that the intensity is constant and the electric field phasor executes a random walk in the complex plane as described by phase diffusion . in the linear approximation ,",
    "valid near threshold , it is true that the behavior of the phase fluctuations alone can be described by phase diffusion , but intensity fluctuations contribute to the linewidth as well . farther above threshold , on the other hand ,",
    "the simple model breaks down because the fluctuations of the intensity and of the phase are coupled due to the nonlinearity of the gain , and the behavior of the phase fluctuations can not be characterized as simple phase diffusion .",
    "the frequently used procedure of disregarding the microscopic intensity fluctuations and assuming that the photon - number distribution is strictly poissonian , on the one hand , and not properly taking into account or even completely neglecting gain saturation , on the other , in general does not yield sufficiently accurate results for the quantum - limited linewidth .",
    "in this paper we have studied the quantum - limited linewidth of a good - cavity laser by determining the first - order correlation function of the laser field at steady state .",
    "it is the decay of this correlation function and not the phase fluctuations alone that determines coherence properties such as , e. g. , the visibility of interference fringes . by taking the fourier",
    "transform we obtained the power spectrum of the laser field and derived an analytical expression for the quantum - limited linewidth as a function of the mean photon number ( see eq .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) ) or of the above - threshold ratio of the laser ( see eq .",
    "( [ 24 ] ) .",
    "our analytical result is in perfect agreement with the results of earlier numerical studies @xcite .",
    "we explicitly demonstrated the effect of a super - poissonian photon statistics ( see eq .",
    "( [ 28 ] ) ) and showed that near threshold the linewidth is considerably larger than the standard phase - diffusion result , ( cf .",
    "( [ 31 ] ) ) , where the intensity is assumed to be constant , or the photon statistics to be poissonian , respectively .",
    "although in most practical cases the laser linewidth is limited by the much larger technical noise and the intrinsic quantum limit can not be reached , there exists a variety of proposals to reach or even go beyond the quantum limit with the help of sophisticated methods @xcite .",
    "our results show that for a precise quantum mechanical description of the laser linewidth it is necessary to directly calculate the first - order correlation function of the laser field , thus implicitly incorporating intensity fluctuations as well as phase fluctuations , and to properly take into account the nonlinearity of the gain .",
