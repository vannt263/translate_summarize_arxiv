    "in 1969 , penrose suggested that there might be a sort of cosmic censor  that forbids naked singularities from forming@xcite , namely singularities that are visible to distant observers .",
    "although there is no proof of such conjecture , naked singularities and the cosmic censorship are still a source of interest .",
    "a simple and particularly interesting example of naked singularities is the negative mass schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "this is simply obtained by the schwarzschild solution@xmath1 replacing @xmath2 with @xmath3 .",
    "this simple substitution gives rise to a naked singularity not protected by a horizon .",
    "an immediate consequence of a negative schwarzschild mass is that if one were to place two bodies initially at rest , one with a negative mass and the other with a positive mass , both will accelerate in the same direction going from the negative mass to the positive one .",
    "furthermore , if the two masses are of the same magnitude , they will uniformly accelerate forever .",
    "[ ptb ]    naked.eps    this feature leads to the problem of stability of such a geometry discussed by gibbons , hartnoll and ishibashi@xcite and gleiser and dotti@xcite .",
    "however , even if the stability issue is an open debate which seems to incline more to the unstable behavior than to the stable one@xcite , in this paper we wish to study the relation between the schwarzschild solution for positive and negative masses with the induced cosmological constant . a cosmological constant can be considered _ induced _  when it appears as a consequence of quantum fluctuations .",
    "since , apparently the schwarzschild solution , naked singularities and the induced cosmological constant appear to be disconnected , it urges to establish a point of contact .",
    "we claim that such a link is in the wheeler - de witt equation ( wdw)@xcite . this equation can be simply obtained starting by the einstein field equations without matter fields in four dimensions@xmath4 where @xmath5 is the einstein tensor and @xmath6 is the cosmological constant . by introducing a time - like unit vector @xmath7 ,",
    "we get@xmath8 this is simply the hamiltonian constraint written in terms of equation of motion . indeed ,",

    "this choice is dictated by considering that the schwarzschild solution represents the only non - trivial static spherical symmetric solution of the vacuum einstein equations .",
    "therefore , in this context the zpe can be attributed only to quantum fluctuations .",
    "an example of this method applied in a completely different context without a cosmological term is in refs.@xcite , where the zpe graviton contribution computed on different metrics is compared . in practice ,",
    "we desire to compute@xmath24 where @xmath25 are the induced cosmological constant computed in the different backgrounds . moreover , the schwarzschild solution for both masses , namely @xmath26 is asymptotically flat . therefore we are comparing backgrounds with the same asymptotically behavior . nevertheless , in eq.@xmath18",
    ", surface terms never come into play because @xmath27 as well @xmath28 are energy densities and surface terms are related to the energy ( e.g. adm mass ) and not to the energy density .",
    "we want to point up that we are neither discussing the problem of forming the naked singularity nor a transition during a gravitational collapse , rather the singularity is considered already existing .",
    "the semi - classical procedure followed in this work relies heavily on the formalism outlined in ref.@xcite , where the graviton one - loop contribution in a schwarzschild background was computed , through a variational approach with gaussian trial wave functionals .",
    "a zeta function regularization is used to deal with the divergences , and a renormalization procedure is introduced , where the finite one loop is considered as a self - consistent source for traversable wormholes . rather than reproducing the formalism",
    ", we shall refer the reader to [ 16 ] for details , when necessary .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows , in section [ p1 ] , we show how to apply the variational approach to the wheeler - de witt equation and we give some of the basic rules to solve such an equation approximated to second order in metric perturbation , in section [ p2 ] , we analyze the spin-2 operator or the operator acting on transverse traceless tensors specified for the schwarzschild metric with @xmath26 , in section [ p3 ] we use the zeta function to regularize the divergences coming from the evaluation of the zpe for tt tensors and we write the renormalization group equation .",

    "<S> the cosmological constant induced by quantum fluctuation of the graviton on a given background is considered as a tool for building a spectrum of different geometries . in particular , we apply the method to the schwarzschild background with positive and negative mass parameter . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , we put on the same level of comparison the related naked singularity @xmath0 and the positive mass wormhole . </S>",
    "<S> we use the wheeler - de witt equation as a basic equation to perform such an analysis regarded as a sturm - liouville problem . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmological constant is considered as the associated eigenvalue . the used method to study </S>",
    "<S> such a problem is a variational approach with gaussian trial wave functionals . </S>",
    "<S> we approximate the equation to one loop in a schwarzschild background . </S>",
    "<S> a zeta function regularization is involved to handle with divergences . </S>",
    "<S> the regularization is closely related to the subtraction procedure appearing in the computation of casimir energy in a curved background . </S>",
    "<S> a renormalization procedure is introduced to remove the infinities together with a renormalization group equation . </S>"
