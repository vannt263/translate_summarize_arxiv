    "the generation of the large scale structures and the anisotropy in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) suggests that there were already small inhomogeneities in the early universe , a few hubble times before the observable scale enters the horizon  @xcite . the time - independent curvature perturbation @xmath1 sets the initial conditions for such inhomogeneity and the subsequent evolution of the scalar perturbation .",
    "after the first observation by penzias and wilson ( 1965 ) fifty years ago , the precise observations of the cmb  @xcite found that the primordial power spectrum is gaussian with the size of @xmath2 and is almost scale - independent with the spectral index @xmath3 .",
    "the inflation models not only explain the problems of the standard big bang cosmology such as the flatness , horizon and monopole problems but also predicts the cosmological perturbations in the matter density and spatial curvature , which explain well the primordial power spectrum  @xcite . those have arisen naturally from the vacuum fluctuations of light scalar field(s ) during inflation , and been promoted to classical one around the time of the horizon exit . as well as",
    "the scalar perturbation , the tensor perturbation is also generated during inflation and shows particular features in the b - mode of the cmb polarization data .",
    "this b - mode polarization from the primordial tensor spectrum has been searched for a long time as a signature of the primordial inflation .",
    "recently , bicep2  @xcite has announced that they have measured the b - mode from the primordial gravitational wave as well as that from the gravitational lensing effect .",
    "the observation prefers to the non - zero tensor spectrum with the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath4 after foreground subtraction with the best dust model , however , the tensor - to - scalar ratio shifts down to  @xcite @xmath5 such a large gravitational wave has profound implications for inflation models .",
    "the tensor power spectrum comes from the expansion of the universe during inflation @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the expansion rate at the horizon exit , and thus the tensor - to - scalar ratio is given by  @xcite @xmath8 here @xmath9 denotes the planck mass ( @xmath10 ) . combining with the observed power spectrum  @xcite @xmath11 the observed large tensor spectrum corresponds to the hubble expansion parameter @xmath12 or to the potential energy during slow - roll inflation @xmath13    however , the slow - roll condition during inflation gives the relation between the field variation and the tensor spectrum known as lyth bound  @xcite , @xmath14 thus , a large tensor is possible only for a large field variation , which is usually larger than the planck scale .",
    "more accurate bounds were studied in  @xcite for the single field inflation .",
    "the problem of sub - planckian inflation with @xmath15 is that the e - folding number is connected to the field variation as @xmath16 and so only @xmath17 is maximally obtained for @xmath18 . in order to achieve a large enough e - foldings , hence ,",
    "@xmath19 should somehow be made decreasing after about 7 e - folds . to be consistent with the observation of cmb ,",
    "moreover , the power spectrum should be maintained as almost a constant even under such a large field variation for the first 7 e - folds @xcite corresponding to the observable scales by cmb , @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "there are some ways suggested to accommodate the large tensor - to - scalar ratio in the sub - planckian inflation models by non - monotonic evolution  @xcite in the single field models or in the assisted inflation  @xcite .    in the inflation with multiple scalar fields  @xcite , however , the simple relation in the single field inflation is modified due to the quite different inflationary dynamics .",
    "the curvature perturbation continues the evolution until the non - adiabatic perturbation is converted to the adiabatic one  @xcite .",
    "even the condition ending the inflation can generate the power spectrum  @xcite and , therefore , changes the tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "however , the b - mode observation requires that the inflaton perturbation must account for much more than 10% of the primordial curvature perturbation for the slow - roll hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "`` hybrid inflation ''",
    "@xcite was suggested with two scalar fields , where one is the inflaton and the other , called the waterfall field , is to terminate inflation when it becomes tachyonic .",
    "the advantage of it is that the inflaton s field value is small compared to the planck scale , and thus it is legitimate to use it as a low energy effective theory . in the supersymmetric ( susy )",
    "version of the hybrid inflation @xcite , the potential can be made flat enough , avoiding the eta - problem : fortunately the hubble induced mass term is accidentally canceled out with the minimal k@xmath21hler potential and the polonyi type superpotential during inflation .",
    "the specific form of the superpotential can be guaranteed by the introduced u(1)@xmath22 symmetry .    by the logarithmic quantum correction to the scalar potential , the inflaton can be drawn to the true minimum , leading to reheating of the universe by the waterfall fields .",
    "moreover , thanks to such a logarithmic correction , the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the waterfall fields can be determined with the cmb anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the vevs turn out to be tantalizingly close to the scale of the grand unified theory ( gut ) . accordingly , the waterfall fields can be regarded as gut breaking higgs fields in this class of models @xcite . this inflationary model predicts a red - tilted power spectrum @xcite around @xmath23 for @xmath24 e - folds .",
    "it is too large compared to the present bound on the spectral index . at the same time",
    ", the tensor spectrum is accordingly too small to detect . in the susy hybrid inflation models with a single inflaton field",
    ", it was found that the tensor - to - scalar ratio is @xmath25  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study a dynamical two field hybrid inflation model @xcite . the dominant potential changes dynamically due to the evolution of another hybrid inflaton field . in the first phase of inflation for around @xmath26 e - foldings , two inflaton fields are active and",
    "generate the power spectrum .",
    "when the first waterfall fields are effective , one inflaton falls down to the minimum and the second phase of hybrid inflation starts .",
    "since the vacuum energy and @xmath19 are almost constant during the first phase of inflation , we can obtain an almost constant power spectrum in this model . in the second phase of inflation",
    ", the potential has the usual shape of the logarithmic one and gives a sufficient e - folding number until the second waterfall fields are effective and the whole inflation ends . since @xmath19 can be made much smaller than @xmath27 in the second phase , we can achieve a large enough e - foldings .",
