    "historically , the evolutionary stage of low- to intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath00.88@xmath5 ) in between the end of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase and the planetary nebula ( pn ) phase has been designated as the proto - planetary nebula phase . this short evolutionary phase of @xmath0@xmath6 is now also called `` preplanetary nebula '' ( e.g. , see sahai et al .  2005 ) because the phrase `` proto - planetary '' is widely used by the exoplanetary and planet formation communities to refer to dusty disks around young stars . following sahai et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , in this work we will use the term `` preplanetary nebula '' ( ppn ) .",
    "we also note that , in the literature , the term preplanetary ( or proto - planetary ) nebulae ( ppne ) has been interchangeably used with the term post - agb objects .",
    "the so - called `` 21@xmath1 '' ppne , a class of c - rich ppne which all exhibit a prominent emission feature at 21@xmath1 , have received increasing attention over the past decades .",
    "this feature was serendipitously discovered by kwok et al .",
    "( 1989 ) in four ppne through the 7.722.6@xmath1 spectra obtained by the _ low resolution spectrometer _ ( lrs ) on board",
    "the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( iras ) . so far , this feature has been seen unambiguously in 27 carbon - rich ppne , including 18 galactic objects ( cerrigone et al .",
    "2011 ) and nine objects in the large and small magellanic clouds ( volk et al .",
    "the spectral profile of the so - called `` 21@xmath1 '' feature displays little variation among different sources : it always peaks at @xmath020.1@xmath1 and has a more or less constant fwhm ( full width at half maximum ) of @xmath02.22.3@xmath1 .",
    "the exact nature of the carriers of this feature remains unknown ever since its discovery in 1989 .",
    "this feature is potentially an important probe of the physical and chemical processes occurring in ppne , a short evolutionary stage immediately preceding the pn phase . also , it is important in terms of energetics since this feature emits up to @xmath78% of the total infrared ( ir ) power of a 21@xmath1 source .",
    "the fact that so much power is carried in this feature suggests that its carrier must be made of abundant elements ( e.g. , c ) . over the past decades ,",
    "over a dozen carrier candidates have been suggested ( e.g. , see posch et al .",
    "2004 , zhang et al .",
    "however , none of them can be considered viable because they either could not reproduce the observed spectral profile ( e.g. , sic [ see jiang et al .",
    "2005 ] , feo [ see li et al .  2013 ] ) or they require too much dust material ( e.g. , tic [ see li 2003 ] ) .",
    "a unique characteristics of the mysterious 21@xmath1 feature is that it is so far only detected in ppne , neither in the agb phase nor in the pn phase .",
    "this might suggest that the condensation of the carriers of the 21@xmath1 feature may occur during the so - called superwind phase ( e.g. , see von helden et al .",
    "2000 ) , a phase of high mass - loss where agb stars lose the remaining stellar envelope and terminate their life on the agb ( see renzini 1981 ) .",
    "it is also possible that , after entering the pn phase , the 21@xmath1-feature carriers may be rapidly destroyed by the highly energetic photons available in pne . to examine this hypothesis , in this work",
    "we derive the stellar mass loss rates of the 21@xmath1 ppne during the agb phase as well as the superwind phase and explore the correlation between the 21@xmath1 feature and the mass loss rates , with an aim of gaining insight into the formation and destruction of the carriers of this mysterious feature .",
    "we will derive the mass loss rates of the 21@xmath1 sources from their infrared ( ir ) emission spectral energy distributions ( seds ) . in this work",
    "we will consider all the 18 galactic 21@xmath1 sources .",
    "the ir emission of these sources have been measured with various instruments through broadband photometry : ( i ) the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( iras ) at 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100@xmath1 , ( ii ) the _ midcourse space experiment _ ( msx ) @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 bands respectively at 8.28 , 12.13 , 14.65 and 21.3@xmath1 , ( iii ) the _ infrared camera _ ( irc ) on board the akari satellite at 9 and 18@xmath1 , and ( iv ) the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( wise ) at 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 and 22@xmath1 .",
    "six of these 18 sources have also been measured at 1.2 mm with the _ max - planck millimeter bolometer _ ( mambo ) array at the 30-meter iram telescope ( buemi et al .",
    "we compile from the literature the stellar and circumstellar parameters of all the 18 galactic 21@xmath1 sources and tabulate them in table  [ tab : starpara ] .",
    "these include the stellar effective temperature @xmath12 , stellar luminosity @xmath13 , stellar core mass @xmath14 , stellar radius @xmath15 , and distance @xmath16 from earth of the central star .",

    "in addition to the 21@xmath1 feature , the 21@xmath1 sources also display a prominent , mysterious emission feature at 30@xmath1 .",
    "the 30@xmath1 feature is very broad and strong and extends from @xmath024@xmath1 to @xmath045@xmath1 .",
    "it often accounts for up to @xmath030% of the total ir luminosity of such an object ( volk et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the 21@xmath1 sources also exhibit a distinctive set of emission features at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , and 11.3@xmath1 ( hrivnak et al .  2008 , volk 2015 ) .",

    "[ fig : drudefit ] we show the spectral decompositional fits to the eight sources . in table",
    "[ tab : drudefit ] we tabulate the fluxes emitted in the 21@xmath1 , 30@xmath1 and uir features .",
    "we employ the `` 2-dust '' radiative transfer code to model the dust ir emission of the selected 21@xmath1 sources , using the _ iras _ ( and the 1.2 mm iram / mambo , if available ) photometric data .",
    "the `` 2-dust '' code , developed by ueta & meixner ( 2003 ) for dusty axisymmetric systems , is well suited for modeling the ir emission of the ppn layered dust shells .",
    "following ueta & meixner ( 2003 ) , we consider a dust density function that has ( i ) a spherical outer shell  the remnant of the agb wind , ( ii ) a spheroidal mid - region , and ( iii ) an inner toroidal core created during the superwind phase  a rather brief period of equatorially - enhanced mass - loss near the end of the agb mass - loss phase .",
    "the mid - region of the shell assumes a somewhat spheroidal distribution , reflecting the transition from a spherical mass - loss geometry to an axial symmetry during the course of the agb mass - loss history .",
    "the underlying assumption of this axisymmetric density distribution function is that the mass loss in the agb phase is spherically symmetric and converted to axisymmetric after the end of the agb phase ( i.e. , the `` superwind '' phase ) .",
    "the adopted density distribution is a function of the radius of the dust shell @xmath26 , the latitudinal angle @xmath27 , and five geometric parameters ( @xmath8 , @xmath28 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ; see meixner et al .",

    "the model parameters @xmath32 , @xmath34 and @xmath33 , when available , are taken from the literature where these parameters are constrained by the optical and ir morphology ( see table  [ tab : modpara ] ) .",
    "the expansion velocity @xmath35 is also taken from the literature , which was mostly determined from the co line emission .",
    "this function defines a three - layer density distribution .",
    "the outermost region has a spherically - symmetric , power - law density distribution @xmath36 which results from the early agb mass loss occurring in an almost perfect spherical symmetry .",
    "the density distribution of the inner - most region is axisymmetric and has an equatorial enhancement .",
    "the equatorial enhancement is considered to be caused by the axisymmetric superwind at the end of the agb phase .",
    "the degree of the equatorial enhancement is controlled by @xmath8 ( with @xmath37 corresponding to spherical symmetry , i.e. , no enhancement ) .",
    "the equatorial enhancement can be made disk - like or toroidal - like by the `` flatness '' parameter @xmath38 , with small @xmath38 values for toroidal density distributions and large @xmath38 values for disk - like structures .",
    "the transitional mid - region is controlled by @xmath9 , the shell elongation parameter .",
    "it turns on and off the latitudinal dependence of the radial fall - off parameter , @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath11 parameters describe the `` abruptness '' of the geometrical transition : the larger @xmath10 and @xmath11 are , the more abrupt is the dissipation of the latitudinal variation in the density distribution ( see ueta & meixner 2003 ) .    for the dust composition , we only consider amorphous carbon dust .",
    "the 21@xmath1 and 30@xmath1 carriers are not included in our modeling for three reasons : ( 1 ) their carriers are unidentified ; ( 2 ) their excitation mechanisms are unknown , i.e. , are they nano - sized and undergo transient heating by single stellar photons [ draine & 2001 , liu et al .  2002 ] like feo [ li et al .",
    "2013 ] and tic nanoparticles [ li 2003 ] or sub-@xmath39m - sized and attain an equilibrium temperature like sic [ jiang et al .",
    "2005 ] and hydrogenated amorphous carbon [ hac ; zhang et al .",
    "2009a ] ) ? and ( 3 ) we are mainly interested to derive the dust mass loss rates .",
    "the carriers of the 21@xmath1 and 30@xmath1 features are not important as far as the mass loss rates are concerned ( see hony et al",
    ".  2002 , 2003 , hony & bouwman 2004 ) .",
    "the absorption and scattering cross sections are computed with mie theory , using the dielectric functions of amorphous carbon of rouleau & martin ( 1991 ) .    for the dust size distribution ,",
    "we take a mrn - type power - law distribution function of @xmath40 for @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the spherical radius of the dust ( we assume the dust to be spherical ) with a lower and upper cutoff of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively ( see mathis et al .  1977 ) .",
    "for a given dust size distribution and a given dust shell structure , the optical depth @xmath45 at wavelength @xmath46 is directly related to the dust quantity .",
    "admittedly , the 2-dust model involves many parameters ( see ueta & meixner 2003 ) .",
    "general considerations help explore parameter space .",
    "the equatorial enhancement parameter @xmath8 which sets the equator - to - pole density ratio ( @xmath47 ) is mainly constrained by the mid - ir emission from warm dust ( i.e. , the _ iras _",
    "25@xmath1 photometry of the 21@xmath1 sources ) . generally speaking",
    ", models with high @xmath8 values produce more mid - ir emission .",
    "the radial - falloff parameter @xmath28 is strongly tied to the mass - loss dynamics : @xmath48 for a steady mass loss , @xmath49 for a steadily increasing mass loss , and @xmath50 for a diminishing mass loss ( see ueta & meixner 2003 ) .",
    "the @xmath28 parameter is mainly constrained by the cold dust emission at @xmath51 , particularly by the 1.2 mm emission . for models with a larger @xmath28 value , more dust",
    "will be concentrated radially closer to the central star and a larger amount of warmer dust will be present in the shell and will therefore emit too much at the mid - ir and too little in the far - ir at @xmath51 . in view that",
    "for 12 over 18 of our sources there is no 1.2 mm photometry available and the longest wavelength data available so far is the _ iras _",
    "100@xmath1 photometry .",
    "it is therefore possible that our sed modeling may favor large @xmath28 values . to avoid this ,",
    "we intend to choose the smallest @xmath28 value which still fits the observed sed . the shell elongation parameter @xmath9 only slightly affects the far - ir emission : models with a larger @xmath9 produces slightly more emission at @xmath52 .",
    "model seds with different @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath38 parameters also show very little difference in the ir .",
    "the model parameters ( particularly @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath38 ) would be better constrained by the optical and ir morphology of the 21@xmath1 sources ( see ueta & meixner 2003 ) .",
    "the 21 and 30@xmath1 features could appreciably contribute to the mid - ir broadband photometry .",
    "particularly , an appreciable fraction of the 21.34@xmath1 _ msx _ @xmath11-band flux of each source could arise from the 21@xmath1 feature .",
    "this is probably also true for the _ akari _ 18@xmath1 band , the _ wise _",
    "22@xmath1 band , and the _ iras _ 25@xmath1 band .",
    "the broad 30@xmath1 feature could account for a smaller ( but not necessarily negligible ) fraction of these broadband detections .",
    "since the carriers of the 21 and 30@xmath1 features are not included in our model , the contributions of these features to the broadband photometry need to be subtracted . to this end , we approximate the 21 and 30@xmath1 features of each source by four drude profiles respectively peaking at 20.1 , 26 , 30 , and 33@xmath1 and integrate the sum of these drude profiles with the filter functions of the _ akari _ 18@xmath1 band , the 21.34@xmath1 _ msx _",

    "it is these feature - subtracted photometric fluxes that we will model .",
    "the inclination ( @xmath53 ) of a nebula is best constrained by the observed nebula morphology .",
    "for some of our sources , the inclination angles have already been derived in the literature from their resolved optical and/or near - ir images . for these sources ,",
    "we adopt the inclination angles reported in the literature ( see table  [ tab : modpara ] ) . for the remaining sources , we consider 10 different inclination angles increasing from @xmath54 ( i.e. , pole - on ) to @xmath55 ( i.e. , edge - on ) at a step of @xmath56 .",
    "we take the inclination angle which provides the best fit to the observed sed .",
    "figure  [ fig : irem1 ] shows the model fits to the observed dust and stellar photometry of the six galactic sources for which the 1.2 mm flux has been measured by iram / mambo .",
    "the overall fits are reasonably satisfactory .",
    "we note that we do not intend to fit the iso/_spitzer _ spectroscopy as we are mostly interested to derive the dust mass loss rates .",

    "spectra overlaid in the sed fit mostly serve as a guide . for iras20000 + 3239",
    ", the model could not fit the iras 100@xmath1 flux . in view of the overall sed ,",
    "it is likely that the iras 100@xmath1 flux could have been overestimated .",
    "figures  [ fig : irem2 ] and [ fig : irem3 ] show the model fits to the observed seds of the 12 galactic sources for which there are no reported 1.2 mm iram / mambo measurements .",
    "similarly , the model fits the observational data fairly well , although it fails at reproducing the 21@xmath1 and 30@xmath1 emission features as it is not our intention to fit these features .",
    "similar to iras20000 + 3239 , for iras05113 + 1347 , iras05341 + 0852 , iras13245 - 5036 , iras19477 + 2401 , and iras23304 + 6147 , the iras 100@xmath1 flux could have been overestimated . in order to examine whether the lack of any photometric data at @xmath52 would `` miss '' the dust that is cold and located in the outer region of the shell ( leading to an underestimate of the dust mass )",
    ", we also fit the seds of the six sources shown in figure  [ fig : irem1 ] for which the 1.2 mm photometric data are available , but neglecting the 1.2 mm photometry .",
    "we find that the dust mass derived from ignoring the 1.2 mm data only differs by @xmath5730% from that in which the 1.2 mm data are included .",
    "this is because , except for iras20000 + 3239 , the 60 , 100@xmath1 and 1.2 mm data do not deviate much from a single power - law and thus no cold component is missing .    in table",
    "[ tab : modpara ] we list the model parameters for the dust density function ( @xmath8 , @xmath28 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath38 ) , the dust size distribution power index @xmath58 , the expansion velocity @xmath35 , and the inner ( @xmath32 ) and outer ( @xmath33 ) boundaries of the ppn dust shell .",
    "it is seen from table  [ tab : modpara ] that the best - fit models for all the galactic 21@xmath1 sources favor @xmath49 , implying a non - steady mass - loss process . as illustrated in eq.[eq : dndr ] , the @xmath28 factor also couples with the density distribution of the sw component . therefore , our best - fit models suggest that both the agb mass - loss and the sw mass - loss are not constant ( i.e. , @xmath59 ) . while in the literature a steady mass - loss is often assumed for modeling the millimeter data of co and even for the dust ir emission sed modeling , we note that a constant mass - loss rate is often an idealistic and simplified assumption .",
    "the production of the mass loss is a complicated process involving both the pulsation of the surface layers of agb stars and the stellar radiation pressure on dust ( see habing et al .",
    "1994 ) . near the end of the agb phase ,",
    "one expects an accelerating increase in mass loss ( see renzini 1981 , gail & sedlmayr 2014 ) .",
    "therefore , one would not expect a constant mass - loss rate along the agb evolution .",
    "nevertheless , if there is only limited observational information about the co emission or the dust ir emission , it is not unreasonable to adopt @xmath48 .    with the assumption of constant velocity mass loss ,",
    "we calculate the time scale ( @xmath60 ) for each source by dividing the size of the extended dust shell with its expansion velocity @xmath35 . for the agb phase ,",

    "the carriers of these features , particularly that of the 30@xmath1 feature , are expected to account for an appreciable fraction of the total dust mass since they account for a substantial fraction of the total ir luminosity . however , without knowing the mineralogical compositions and optical properties of their carriers , we are not able to determine their masses .    to gauge the range over which a parameter could vary while the overall model fit to the observed sed remains acceptable , following the approach of sargent et al .",

    ". a simultaneous modeling of the seds and the resolved scattered - light images in the optical / near - ir as well as other data ( e.g. , spectropolarimetry ) would allow many parameters to be more accurately explored ( e.g. , see oppenheimer et al .",
    ". nevertheless , the parameters derived here are generally consistent with that from more sophisticated models .",
    "for example , for the common source iras  04296 + 3429 , our mass loss rate and mass loss duration agree with that of oppenheimer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) within the uncertainty range .",
    "we now explore the relation of the 21@xmath1 feature with the stellar mass loss rates .",

    "in contrast , with a pearson correlation coefficient of @xmath81 and a kendall @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the 21@xmath1 feature shows a much weaker correlation with @xmath4 , if at all .",
    "this suggests that the carriers of the 21@xmath1 feature are probably formed in the agb phase .",
    "the nondetection of the 21@xmath1 feature in agb stars suggests that the excitation of its carriers may require ultraviolet ( uv ) photons which are available in ppne but not in agb stars .",
    "more likely , the 21@xmath1 feature carriers could be embedded in or attached to some sort of bulk carbon dust ( e.g. , sub-@xmath39m - sized hac ) as nano - sized `` islands '' or `` side - groups units '' . upon leaving the agb phase , the uv photons of ppne",
    "break them away from the bulk dust and excite them to emit at 21@xmath1 . ultimately , they are destroyed by the much harder uv photons in pne .",

    "2009b ; also see messenger et al .",
    "2013 , otsuka et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "we have also examined the correlation of the 30@xmath1 feature with the stellar mass loss rates @xmath3 and @xmath4 . as shown in figure",
    "[ fig:30um.mass.loss ] , with a pearson correlation coefficient of @xmath84 and a kendall @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the 30@xmath1 feature shows a moderate correlation with @xmath3 .",
    "this , consistent with its detection in agb stars , implies that its carriers condense in the agb phase and its excitation does not require uv photons .",
    "figure  [ fig:30um.mass.loss ] also shows that , with @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , the 30@xmath1 feature and the superwind is somewhat correlated , suggesting that the 30@xmath1 feature carriers could also condense in the superwind .",
    "based on the principal component analysis ( pca ) method , we have also applied a fully non - parametric multivariate analysis to the four variables @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 to determine their possible correlations and statistical significance . as shown in table  [",
    "tab : multivariate ] , the results derived from the pca multivariate analysis technique are in close agreement with that of the pearson linear parametric analysis and that of the kendall non - parametric analysis : while the 21@xmath1 feature appears to correlate with @xmath3 but not with @xmath4 , the 30@xmath1 feature seems to correlate with both @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    in figure  [ fig:21um.30um.irtot ]",
    "we show the correlations of @xmath17 and @xmath18 with the total ir emission @xmath90 obtained by integrating the observed dust ir sed over the entire wavelength range . while it is apparent that both @xmath17 and @xmath18 correlate with @xmath91 , the latter shows a closer correlation with @xmath91 than the former .",
    "this supports the idea of the condensation of the 21@xmath1 feature carrier mainly occurring in the agb phase while the 30@xmath1 feature carrier could condense both in the agb phase and in the superwind phase .",
    "if one assumes that all kinds of dust species are proportionally condensed , one would expect @xmath17 to be proportional to the ir power @xmath92 emitted by the bulk dust generated in the agb phase .",
    "in contrast , @xmath18 is expected to be proportional to the total ir power @xmath93 emitted both by the bulk dust generated in the agb phase ( @xmath92 ) and by the bulk dust generated in the superwind ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that while the mass loss rates @xmath3 and @xmath4 derived in  [ sec : massloss ] have not included the ( unknown ) carriers of the 21 and 30@xmath1 features , the total ir emission @xmath91 is obtained by integrating over the entire sed and therefore does include the contributions from both features .",
    "the fact that the correlations of @xmath91 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 are consistent with the correlations of @xmath3 ( and @xmath4 for the 30@xmath1 feature as well ) with @xmath17 and @xmath18 implies that the exclusion of the 21 and 30@xmath1 feature carriers in deriving the mass loss rates does not affect our correlation studies .",
    "the 21@xmath1 sources also emit at the uir bands ( hrivnak et al .",
    ". however , the spectral profiles of the uir bands of the galactic 21@xmath1 sources are `` unusual '' in the sense that they appear substantially different from that of the typical interstellar uir bands ( see peeters et al .  2002 ) .",
    "most notably , while at @xmath08@xmath1 the interstellar uir bands have two well - separated features at 7.7 and 8.6@xmath1 , the galactic 21@xmath1 sources have a broad 8@xmath1 feature .",
    "the uir features are widely seen in ppne , pne and the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "however , they are rarely seen in agb stars . the few c stars that display the uir features all have a hot companion that emits uv photons ( speck & barlow 1997 , boersma et al .",
    "2006 ) . in the context of pahs as the carriers of the uir features",
    ", one may ascribe the nondetection of the uir features in c stars to that , due to lack of uv photons in cool c - rich agb stars , pahs , even present in the circumstellar envelopes around c - rich agb stars , may not be sufficiently excited to emit in the near- and mid - ir .",
    "however , li & draine ( 2002 ) have demonstrated that the excitation of pahs does not require uv photons , and the visible / near - ir photons available in c stars are capable of exciting pahs to emit at the `` uir '' bands .",
    "the visible / near - ir absorption spectra measured by mattioda et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for pah ions further support the finding of li & draine ( 2002 ) that pahs can be excited by the soft stellar photons from c stars . in principle",
    ", it would be of great value to examine the correlation of the uir features with the stellar mass loss rates @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "_ if _ the uir features are shown to correlate with @xmath3 , one could speculate that their carriers , like that of the 21@xmath1 feature , could form in the agb phase as aromatic `` islands '' embedded in bulk hac dust .",
    "the nondetection of the uir bands in agb stars could merely indicate that the carriers of the uir features could not be knocked off the bulk dust by the photons of agb stars as free - flying aromatic hydrocarbon molecules .",
    "unfortunately , the _ spitzer_/irs or _ iso_/sws spectra of the 21@xmath1 sources do not always span all the uir bands . more specifically , for some sources there lack spectroscopic data at @xmath95 ( e.g. , see figure  [ fig : drudefit ] ) which prevents an accurate determination of @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , we do not intend to explore the possible correlation between @xmath19 and @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "finally , we note that we have not considered the nine 21@xmath1 sources detected in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) both of which are metal - poor : the metallicity of the lmc is @xmath71/4 of that in the galaxy ( russell & dopita 1992 ) , while the metallicity of the smc is only @xmath01/10 of that of the galaxy ( kurt & dufour 1998 ) . with respect to the overall mid - ir emission and the uir emission , the relative strengths of the 21 and 30@xmath1 features of the magellanic cloud sources",
    "are appreciably weaker than that of the galactic 21@xmath1 sources . also ,",
    "the spectral appearance of the uir features of the magellanic cloud 21@xmath1 sources is remarkably different from that of the galaxy .",
    "while most of the galactic 21@xmath1 sources have `` unusual '' uir spectral profiles , the magellanic cloud 21@xmath1 sources show more `` normal '' looking uir features .",
    "therefore , we prefer not to investigate the relation between @xmath19 and @xmath3 or @xmath4 of the galactic and magellanic cloud 21@xmath1 sources as one class .",
    "the uir carriers of the galactic 21@xmath1 sources could be richer in aliphatics than that of the ism and the magellanic cloud 21@xmath1 sources ( see li & draine 2012 , yang et al .",
    "we have modeled the dust ir emission seds of the 21@xmath1 sources using the 2-dust radiative transfer code for axisymmetric dusty systems .",
    "we have derived their mass loss rates in the agb and superwind phases .",
    "we have explored the correlation between the mass loss rates and the unidentified 21@xmath1 and 30@xmath1 features seen in carbon - rich ppne .",
    "the principal results of this paper are the following :    1 .",
    "the 21@xmath1 feature which is only seen in carbon - rich ppne tends to correlate with @xmath3 but not with @xmath4 , suggesting that its carrier could condense in the agb phase but its excitation and/or generation requires uv photons which are available in ppne but not in agb stars .",
    "the 21@xmath1 feature carrier could be destroyed by the more energetic photons available in pne .",
    "the 30@xmath1 feature which is seen in agb stars , ppne and pne correlates with @xmath3 and , to a less degree , with @xmath4 , suggesting that its carrier could condense both in the agb phase and in the superwind and it can be excited by visible / near - ir photons .",

    "<S> over two decades ago , a prominent , mysterious emission band peaking at @xmath020.1@xmath1 was serendipitously detected in four preplanetary nebulae ( ppne ; also known as `` protoplanetary nebulae '' ) . to date , this spectral feature , designated as the `` 21@xmath1 '' feature , has been seen in 27 carbon - rich ppne in the milky way and the magellanic clouds . the nature of its carriers remains unknown although many candidate materials have been proposed . </S>",
    "<S> the 21@xmath1 sources also exhibit an equally mysterious , unidentified emission feature peaking at 30@xmath1 . while the 21@xmath1 feature is _ exclusively _ seen in ppne , a short - lived evolutionary stage between the end of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and planetary nebula ( pn ) phases , the 30@xmath1 feature is more commonly observed in all stages of stellar evolution from the agb through ppn to pn phases . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the stellar mass loss rates ( @xmath2 ) of these sources from their infrared ( ir ) emission , using the `` 2-dust '' radiative transfer code for axisymmetric dusty systems which allows one to distinguish the mass loss rates of the agb phase ( @xmath3 ) from that of the superwind ( @xmath4 ) phase . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the correlation between @xmath3 or @xmath4 and the fluxes emitted from the 21 and 30@xmath1 features . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both features tend to correlate with @xmath3 , suggesting that their carriers are probably formed in the agb phase . </S>",
    "<S> the nondetection of the 21@xmath1 feature in agb stars suggests that , unlike the 30@xmath1 feature , the excitation of the carriers of the 21@xmath1 feature may require ultraviolet photons which are available in ppne but not in agb stars . </S>"
