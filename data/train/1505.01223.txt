    "understanding what parameters of the systems control the different sc gap structures observed experimentally is paramount to elucidate the microscopic pairing mechanism in the fe - hts s and , more generally , to provide a deeper understanding of the phenomenon of high - temperature superconductivity . on the theoretical front , it has been proposed that both the @xmath8-wave and @xmath0-wave states are close competitors for the sc ground state @xcite .",
    "although the former generally wins , it has been pointed out that a @xmath0-wave state may be realized upon removing electron or hole pockets . on the experimental front ,",

    "we show in the following how these behaviors indicate the appearance of nodes in the gap function .      in order to investigate a possible change of the symmetry of the sc gap",
    ", we note that @xmath52 is related to the relaxation rate @xmath51 by the equation @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the muon , and @xmath55 is the magnetic - flux quantum .",

    "we consider two different possibilities for the gap functions : either a constant gap , @xmath70 , or an angle - dependent gap of the form @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the polar angle around the fermi surface .",
    "the data at @xmath35 = 0 gpa are described remarkably well by two constant gaps , @xmath73 = 2.7(5 ) mev and @xmath74 = 8.4(3 ) mev .",
    "these values are in perfect agreement with our previous results @xcite and also with arpes experiments @xcite , pointing out that most fe - based hts s exhibit two - gap behavior , characterized by one large gap with @xmath75 and one small gap with @xmath76 .",
    "in contrast to the case @xmath35 = 0 gpa , for all applied pressures @xmath77 is better described by one constant gap and one angle - dependent gap , confirming the presence of gap nodes , as inferred from our qualitative analysis .",
    "note that a fitting to two angle - dependent gaps is inconsistent with the data .    to understand the implications of the fitting to a constant and an angle - dependent gap for finite pressures , we analyze the two different scenarios in which nodes can emerge : a nodal @xmath8 state ( with gap functions of different signs in the hole and in the electron pockets ) and a @xmath0-wave state . in the former , the position of the nodes are accidental , i.e. not enforced by symmetry , while in the latter the nodes are enforced by symmetry to be on the brillouin zone diagonals .",

    "[ fig4a ] , where a density plot of the gap functions is superimposed to the typical fermi surface of the iron pnictides , consisting of one or more hole pockets at the center of the brillouin zone , and electron pockets at the border of the brillouin zone . in this figure , we set the accidental nodes of the @xmath8 state to be on the electron pockets , as observed by arpes in the related compound bafe@xmath5(as@xmath9p@xmath10)@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "note that in the @xmath0-wave state , while nodes appear in the hole pockets , the electron pockets have nearly uniform gaps .",

    "[ fig4a],title=\"fig : \" ]    to contrast the scenarios of a nodal @xmath8 gap and a @xmath0-wave gap , we consider a microscopic model that goes beyond the simplifications of independent gap functions of the @xmath78-model discussed above . in this microscopic model ,",
    "the fully coupled non - linear gap equations are solved for a hole pocket @xmath79 and two electron pockets @xmath80 , and the penetration depth is calculated at all temperatures .",
    "the free parameters are then the density of states of the pockets , the amplitude of the pairing interaction , and the gap functions themselves ( details in the supplementary material ) . for simplicity ,",
    "the anisotropies of the electron pockets are neglected , the fermi velocities of the pockets are assumed to be nearly the same , and the gaps are expanded in their leading harmonics .",

    "note the difference in the position of the nodes in each case : while for the @xmath0-wave case they are always at @xmath85 , for the nodal @xmath8 the nodes exist only when @xmath86 at arbitrary positions @xmath87 .",
    "the results of the fittings for the pressures @xmath35 = 1.57 gpa and @xmath882.25 gpa imposing a nodal @xmath8 state are shown in figs .",
    "3c and f. remarkably , we find in both cases that the best fit gives @xmath89 .",

    "therefore , at least within our model , a nodal @xmath8 state is compatible with the data only if the accidental nodes are fine - tuned to lie either at or very close to the diagonals of the electron pockets for a broad pressure range . since the position of the accidental nodes",
    "is expected to be sensitive to the topology of the fermi surface , and consequently to pressure , it seems more plausible that the gap state is @xmath0-wave , since in that case the position of the gaps is enforced by symmetry to be along the diagonals of the hole pockets regardless of the value of the pressure .",

    "5c ) , indicating a spectral weight shift to the smaller gap .",
    "the parameters extracted from the microscopic model are discussed in the supplementary material .",
    "the most essential finding of our paper is the observation that pressure promotes a nodal sc gap in ba@xmath3rb@xmath4fe@xmath5as@xmath5 .",
    "this conclusion is robust and model - independent , as it relies on the qualitative change in the low - temperature behavior of @xmath28 from exponential to linear in @xmath24 upon applied pressure . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first direct experimental demonstration of a pressure induced change in the superconducting gap structure in a fe - hts s .",
    "two possible gap structures could be realized at finite pressures : a nodal @xmath8 state and a @xmath0-wave state . in the first case ,",
    "the change from nodeless @xmath8 to nodal @xmath8 is a crossover rather than a phase transition @xcite , whereas in the latter it is an actual phase transition that could harbor exotic pairing states , such as @xmath95 @xcite or @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "additional results provide important clues of how pressure may induce either an @xmath8 or a @xmath0-wave state . in the closely related optimally - doped compound ba@xmath97k@xmath98fe@xmath5as@xmath5 , raman spectroscopy @xcite , as well as theoretical calculations @xcite ,",
    "reveal a sub - dominant @xmath0-wave state close in energy to the dominant @xmath8 state .",
    "pressure may affect this intricate balance , and tip the balance in favor of the @xmath0-wave state .",
    "on the other hand , theoretical calculations have shown that the pnictogen height is an important factor in determining the structure of the @xmath8 sc order parameter @xcite .",
    "a systematic comparison of the quasiparticle excitations in the 1111 , 122 , and 111 families of fe - hts s showed that the nodal @xmath8 state is favored when the pnictogen height decreases below a threshold value of @xmath29 1.33  @xcite .",
    "hydrostatic pressure may indeed shorten the pnictogen height and consequently modify the @xmath8 gap structure from nodeless to nodal .",
    "although our fitting of the penetration depth data to both a microscopic model and an effective @xmath78-model suggest that the @xmath0-wave state is more likely to be realized than the nodal @xmath8 state , further quantitative calculations of the pressure effect are desirable to completely discard a nodal @xmath8 state .",
    "besides the appearance of nodes with pressure , another interesting observation is the reduction of @xmath62 under pressure , despite the fact that @xmath30 remains nearly unchanged .",
    "interestingly , in the compound bafe@xmath5as@xmath11p@xmath10 , a sharp enhancement of @xmath62 is observed as optimal doping is approached from the overdoped side @xcite , which has been interpreted in terms of a putative quantum critical point ( qcp ) inside the sc dome @xcite . in ba@xmath3rb@xmath4fe@xmath5as@xmath5 , if such a putative qcp is also present , pressure is likely to move the system away from the putative qcp , which , according to the results of bafe@xmath5as@xmath11p@xmath10 , would explain the observed suppression of the penetration depth at @xmath66 .",
    "this scenario does not explain why @xmath14 stays nearly constant under pressure , but this could be due to the intrinsic flatness of @xmath30 around optimal doping in ba@xmath9rb@xmath10fe@xmath5as@xmath5 .",
    "note that a similar behavior for @xmath6 and @xmath30 with pressure has been recently observed in lafeaso@xmath9f@xmath10 @xcite , but interpreted in terms of the interplay between impurity scattering and pressure . to distinguish unambiguously between these two scenarios , pressure - dependent studies of the quasiparticle mass in ba@xmath3rb@xmath4fe@xmath5as@xmath5 are desirable , in order to probe whether a putative qcp is present or not in this compound .",
    "in conclusion , the zero - temperature magnetic penetration depth @xmath27 and the temperature dependence of @xmath68 were studied in optimally doped ba@xmath3rb@xmath4fe@xmath5as@xmath5 by means of @xmath25sr experiments as a function of pressure up to p @xmath29 2.25 gpa .",

    "we see that the fitting is not as good in the region immediately below @xmath30 .",
    "we will discuss this issue in more details below .",
    "for the pressurized samples , the fitting is overall better and indicates a nodal state ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the value of the density of states ratio @xmath227 is little affected by pressure ( as expected , since no charge carriers are introduced ) , and is consistent with the value of a nearly compensated metal .",
    "surprisingly , the best fittings for both the @xmath225 gpa and @xmath226 gpa cases give @xmath219 , where the nodes on the electron pockets are fixed at @xmath228 .",
    "this is a very special case of the accidentally nodal @xmath8 state , since by symmetry there is no reason for @xmath91 to vanish . to make this point more transparent , in fig .",
    "12a we plot the non - zero pressure data and the theoretical urves for the penetration depth for various values of @xmath91  keeping all the other parameters constant .",

    "i.e. a nodeless superconducting state  describes the data better near @xmath30 , on the expense of a very bad fitting at low temperatures  where the nodal behavior is evident .",
    "as we discussed in the previous section , a nodal-@xmath8 state with @xmath219 is indistinguishable  for fitting purposes  from a @xmath0-wave state . since there is no symmetry reason to have @xmath219 in our simple model , or even @xmath231 over a wide pressure range",
    ", we interpret this result as an indirect indication that a @xmath0-wave state is more likely to be the state of the pressurized samples .    finally , we comment on the difficulty of the fittings to capture the behavior near @xmath30  particularly for the sample at ambient pressure ( see fig .",
    "one reason could be the presence of inhomogeneities , which would require a distribution of gaps to be taken into account , instead of a single gap value . another reason could be related to our choice of fixing the fermi velocities to be the same for both the electron and hole pockets . to investigate this possibility ,",
    "we lift this restriction and allow @xmath232 to also be a fitting parameter . the result is shown in fig .",
    "clearly , we obtain a better fitting , but not only @xmath202 is relatively large , but the ratios @xmath227 and @xmath232 are very large or very small , which is difficult to reconcile with the fermi surface of these materials .",
    "most likely , additional pockets are necessary to capture the full temperature dependence of the penetration depth .",
    "nevertheless , our microscopic model provides results that agree with those obtained from the @xmath78-model fitting , particularly in the low - temperature regime , suggesting that a @xmath0-wave state is more likely to be realized than a nodal @xmath8 state ."
