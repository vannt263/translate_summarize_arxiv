    "the successful launch and operation of the _ swift _ mission ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) have led to several important discoveries ( e.g. tagliaferri et al .",
    "2005 ; burrows et al . 2005 ; gehrels et al . 2005 ; fox et al . 2005 ; barthelmy et al . 2005 ; roming et al . 2006 ; cusumano et al .",
    "combined analyses of the early data from the burst alert telescope ( bat ) and the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) for a large sample of bursts ( nousek et al .",
    "2006 ; obrien et al .",
    "2006 ) reveal a canonical x - ray afterglow lightcurve characterized by 5 components ( zhang et al .",
    "2006a , see also nousek et al .",
    "2006 ) : a steep - decay component associated with the grb prompt emission tail , a shallow decay component likely due to refreshing of the forward shock , a normal decay component , a possible steep decay component following a jet break , as well as one or more x - ray flares .",
    "these new data provide unprecedented information to unveil the nature of these mysterious explosions .",
    "one of the outstanding problems in the pre-_swift _ era concerned the emission site of the prompt @xmath6-ray emission .",
    "it is generally believed that grb prompt emission originates at a distance internal to the fireball deceleration radius .",
    "the most widely discussed scenario is the internal shock model ( rees & mszros 1994 ; kobayashi et al .",
    "1997 ; daigne & mochkovitch 1998 ) , but magnetic dissipation at an internal radius is also possible ( e.g. usov 1992 ; thompson 1994 ; drenkhahn & spruit 2002 ; giannios & spruit 2006 ) . the broad - band afterglows , on the other hand , are produced by the external shocks when the fireball is decelerated by the ambient medium ( mszros & rees 1997 ; sari et al .",
    "internal+external shock \" model suggests that the prompt emission and the afterglow involve two distinct processes at two different emission sites .",
    "alternatively , it has been argued that both the grb prompt emission and their afterglows are produced in external shocks , provided that the immediate medium near the burster is clumpy enough ( dermer & mitman 1999 ; 2003 ) .",
    "the evidence collected in the pre-_swift _ era can not conclusively differentiate between the internal and the external models ( see zhang & msros 2004 for a critical review on the successes and limitations of both models ) .",
    "it is one of the scientific goals of the _ swift _ to pin down the emission site of grb prompt emission using early afterglow data .",
    "the steep - decay component commonly existing in early x - ray afterglows ( tagliaferri et al .",
    "2005 ; barthelmy et al .",
    "2005b ; cusumano et al .",
    "2006b ; vaughan et al .",
    "2006 ) has been generally interpreted as the tail of the prompt emission ( zhang et al .",
    "2006a ; nousek et al .",
    "2006 ; panaitescu et al .",
    "2006 ; yamazaki et al . 2006 ; lazzati & begelman 2006 ) .",
    "this component strongly suggests that the prompt emission and the afterglow are two distinct components , which supports the internal origin of the prompt emission ( zhang et al .",
    "2006a ; cf . c. d. dermer , 2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "the distinct x - ray flares typically show rapid rise and fall , with the ratio of the variability time scale and the epoch of the flare typically much less than unity , i.e. @xmath7 ( burrows et al . 2005 ; falcone et al .",
    "2006 ; romano et al .",
    "burrows et al .",
    "( 2005 ) proposed in their discovery paper that the flares are also produced in internal shocks at later times , which requires reactivation of the grb central engine .",
    "zhang et al .",
    "( 2006a ) performed more detailed analysis of various possible scenarios and concluded that the late internal dissipation model is the correct interpretation of x - ray flares .",
    "similar conclusions have been also drawn by ioka et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , fan & wei ( 2005 ) , falcone et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and romano et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ( c.f .",
    "piro et al .",
    "2005 ; c. d. dermer 2006 , in preparation ) .    an important clue to diagnose the internal origin of the prompt emission and the x - ray flares",
    "is the steep decay components following the prompt emission and the flares .",
    "these mark the sudden cessations of the emission , and the rapid decays are due to the observer receiving the progressively delayed emission from higher latitudes - the so - called `` curvature effect '' ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ; dermer 2004 ; zhang et al .",
    "2006a ; fan & wei 2005 ; panaitescu et al . 2006 ; dyks et al .",
    "2006 ; wu et al .",
    ". the internal emission could be either from conventional internal shocks ( rees & mszros 1994 ; kobayashi et al .",
    "1997 ; daigne & mochkovitch 1998 ) or from magnetic dissipation at an internal radius ( e.g. usov 1992 ; thompson 1994 ; drenkhahn & spruit 2002 ; giannios & spruit 2006 ) .",
    "usually the detected emission contains the contributions from many emission episodes ( e.g. emission from many internal shocks or magnetic dissipation regions ) .",
    "each emission episode is expected to be followed by a curvature effect tail after the cessation of the emission ( e.g. shock crosses the shell or magnetic reconnection finishes ) . for highly overlapping emission episodes ( e.g. the prompt emission ) , a curvature tail is usually buried beneath the rising lightcurve of another episode , so that it is difficult to observe a clear curvature effect signature . although extensive studies have been made of the curvature effect in the prompt emission phase ( fenimore et al .",
    "1996 ; sari & piran 1997 ; ryde & petrosian 2002 ; norris 2002 ; kocevski et al .",
    "2003 ; qin et al . 2004 ; shen et al . 2005 ; qin & lu 2005 ) , no conclusive evidence supporting this effect has been presented ( e.g. kocevski et al . 2003 ) .    a clear , testable prediction of the curvature effect when the viewing angle is larger than the @xmath8 cone ( where @xmath9 is the bulk lorentz factor of the emission region ) is that the temporal decay index @xmath10 should be related to the spectral index @xmath3 by the expression ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) @xmath11 where the convention @xmath12 is adopted .",
    "this relation is valid under the following assumptions , i.e. ( 1 ) there is a sharp drop off in the injection of accelerating electrons at a certain radius , after which the electrons cool adiabatically ; ( 2 ) no spectral break energy crosses the observational band during the epoch of decay ; and ( 3 ) the observational band is above the cooling frequency .",
    "when these conditions are satisfied , such a relation is rather robust regardless of the fireball history ( e.g. zhang et al .",
    "2006a ; fan & wei 2005 ; dyks et al . 2006",
    "; wu et al . 2006 ) , and depends only on the jet structure when the line of sight is outside the bright jet core ( dyks et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "several effects could lead to deviations from eq.(1 ) .",
    "the most important one is the zero time effect ( @xmath4-effect ) .",
    "the @xmath4-effect is crucial , since when considering the multiple reactivation of the central engine , the grb trigger time is no longer special ( zhang et al .",
    "every time when the central engine is re - started , the new central engine time should be re - set as @xmath4 .",
    "the conventional lightcurves are plotted as @xmath13 - @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the time when the grb triggers bat .",
    "when we consider the emission from a late central engine activity episode , the relevant decay slope ( in order to be compared with the theoretical prediction in eq.[1 ] ) is @xmath16 rather than @xmath17 . properly shifting @xmath4 is therefore crucial to understand the real temporal decay index in the lightcurves issue is also relevant when discussing orphan afterglows from dirty fireballs ( huang et al .",
    "2002 ) . ] .",
    "for internal dissipation models ( both internal shocks or internal magnetic dissipation ) , the expected @xmath4 of a certain flare should be at the beginning of the corresponding emission episode , i.e. near the starting point of the rising segment of the flare .",
    "since both @xmath10 and @xmath3 could be directly derived from the swift xrt observations , this provides a solid self - consistency test to the curvature - effect interpretation and the internal - origin hypothesis .    another effect that leads to deviations from eq.(1 )",
    "is the overlapping effect ( zhang et al .",
    "2006a ) , i.e. there is an underlying forward shock component beneath the steep decays . in order to perform a clean test to the curvature effect ,",
    "such a component needs to be subtracted .",
    "kumar & panaitescu ( 2000 ) suggested that the contribution of the external shock component is significant if the ambient density is not lower than @xmath18 .",
    "in this paper we use the xrt data to test the curvature - effect interpretation and internal - origin hypothesis of the grb prompt emission and x - ray flares .",
    "we take the grb sample presented by obrien et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and focus on the steep decay components following the prompt emission and the x - ray flares .",
    "we _ assume _ that the curvature effect is the cause of the steep decays so that eq.([curvature ] ) is valid ubiquitously . after subtracting the underlying contribution from the forward shock ,",
    "we derive the @xmath4 values by fitting the light curves with our model .",
    "the object is to check whether the location of @xmath4 is consistent with the expectation of the model , i.e. near the starting point of the relevant emission episode .",
    "the fitting model is described in  2 .",
    "the data and the fitting results are presented in  3 .",
    "conclusions are drawn in  4 with some discussion .",
    "the rapid decay component is our primary interest .",
    "as discussed above we assume that this component is mainly contributed by the curvature effect . on the other hand , the overlapped contribution from an external shock component for @xmath19 @xmath20 could result in a decay that would deviate significantly from eq.(1 ) ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) . considering both the @xmath4-effect and the overlapping effect , we model any steep decay component and the succeeding afterglow component with the function ( zhang et al .",
    "2005 ) @xmath21 where @xmath3 is the x - ray spectral index during the decay , @xmath4 is the time zero point of the emission episode related to the decay ( which in principle should be at the beginning of the rising segment of the last pulse of the prompt emission or the relevant x - ray flare if the curvature interpretation is correct ) , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are normalization parameters for both the rapid decay component and the underlying forward shock component , respectively , and @xmath24 is the temporal index of the forward shock emission component",
    ". please note that we take the zero point time of the external shock component ( afterglow ) as the grb trigger time .",
    "this has been proved by detailed numerical simulations ( lazzati & begelman 2006 ; s. kobayashi et al .",
    "2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "the _ swift _ grb sample we use is the same sample presented by obrien et al .",
    "these are the bursts detected by the _",
    "swift _ prior to october 1 , 2005 for which prompt slews within 10 minutes were performed .",
    "the bat data were processed using the standard bat analysis software ( _ swift _ software v. 2.0 ) .",
    "the xrt data were processed using xrtpipeline v0.8.8 .",
    "the joined bat - xrt lightcurves were derived through extrapolating the bat lightcurves into the xrt band ( 0.3 - 10 kev ) using the joint bat - xrt spectral parameters . for the details of the data reduction procedure we refer to obrien et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . for our purpose",
    ", we include only those grbs whose xrt lightcurves have a steep decay component connecting to the prompt emission and those grbs that harbor x - ray flares . in some bursts there are multiple flares , and hence , multiple steep decays . for these bursts we treat each steep decay independently .",
    "we consider only those prompt emission tails or flare tails whose decay slopes are steeper than -2 with the zero time set to the grb trigger time . for the heavily - overlapped flares in the early xrt light curves , we take only those that are well identified visually and without significant substructures .",
    "our sample includes 36 prompt - emission / flare tails from 22 grbs , which are tabulated in table 1 .",
    "their lightcurves are collected in fig.1 .",
    "technically one needs to identify the time interval for which our above test is performed .",
    "since the steep - decay components ( the tails of the prompt emission or the x - ray flares ) are required to satisfy the curvature effect , we need to search for a segment of lightcurve whose decay slope is steeper than -2 .",
    "we choose a time window that contains 4 data points .",
    "we start the search from the beginning of the steep decay that follows the prompt emission or from the peak of a certain flare .",
    "we then move the time window to later times by shifting one data point in each step .",
    "we fit the decay slope for the four data points in the time window in each step until the slope becomes steeper than -2 . by then the beginning of the time window",
    "is set to the starting point of the steep decay component .",
    "the end of the time interval for which our fit is performed is selected visually without a rigid criterion .",
    "for those prompt - emission / flare tails with an underlying shallow decay ( afterglow ) component , we take the end of that component ( before a further break if any ) as the end of the time interval and fit the data using eq.([fits ] ) . for some tails without superposition of an underlying afterglow component or",
    "otherwise highly overlapped with other flares , we simply choose the last data point of the steep decay component as the end of the time interval and fit the lightcurve using eq.([fits ] ) by setting @xmath25 .",
    "the grbs 050406 , 050502b , 050713b , and 050801 have a very flat segment following the tails of the prompt emission or flares .",
    "these flat segments have only a few data points , and we fix the @xmath24 values in our fitting for these grbs .",
    "several bursts , e.g. grbs 050712 ( the first and the second flares ) , 050713a , 050716 ( the first flare ) , 050730 ( the 1st - 4th flares ) , and 050822 ( the first and second flares ) have heavily overlapped flares before the typical long tail as observed in many other grbs ( e.g. 050126 , 050219 , 050315 , etc . ) .",
    "we also fit these flares .",
    "the xrt light curve of grb 050714b has a rapid flare in the tail segment .",
    "the level of this flare is significantly higher than the tail .",
    "we subtract the flare from the tail segment and fit the tail segment and the flare independently .",
    "the spectral indices we use are from obrien et al .",
    "these spectral indices are derived from the spectral fitting to the overall x - ray data without considering spectral variability . in principle",
    "one should use the @xmath3 value during the steep decay to perform the test .",
    "however the photon counts during the steep decay only are usually too low to give a high significance fit .",
    "the x - ray spectra of some grbs , such as grb 050502b ( falcone et al .",
    "2006 ) and grb 050607 ( pagani et al 2006 ) , have detectable spectral variability .",
    "we check the difference made by this effect with grb 050502b , and find that this effect does not significantly affect our fitting results . throughout this analysis",
    "we use the spectral indices from obrien et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "our fitting results are summarized in table 1 . in figure 1",
    ", we mark the time interval of the fitting data and the fitting curve by solid lines , and indicate the fitted @xmath4 of each steep decay component by a vertical dash - dotted line . for those lightcurves with multiple tail / flares ,",
    "we identify the @xmath4 of the @xmath26-th steep decay component as @xmath27 .",
    "the reduced @xmath28 of the fits are also shown in fig . 1 .    from fig .",
    "1 we find that , except those heavily - overlapped flares in the early xrt light curves , the fitted @xmath4 s of a good fraction of the well - identified tails are right at the beginning of the rising phase of the flare or the last pulse of the prompt emission . these include grbs 050126 ,",
    "050219a , 050319 , 050406 , 050422 , 050502b ( the late flare ) , 050607 , 050712 ( the third flare ) , 050716 ( the second flare ) , 050724 ( the late flare ) , 050803 , and 050822 ( the third flare ) .",
    "this is well consistent with our starting hypothesis , i.e. the flares are of internal origin and mark the re - activations of the central engine ( zhang et al .",
    "we emphasize that the fitted @xmath4 s are based on the hypothesis of the curvature effect as the origin of the steep decay , which is only relevant to internal models , not to external models .",
    "so even if some external models may also allow re - set of @xmath4 before the flares , the decay slope after the peak would follow some other predictions ( typically flatter than @xmath29 , e.g. wu et al .",
    "2006 ) . as a result ,",
    "the fitted @xmath4 s to satisfy those predictions would be significantly different from the ones we obtained , i.e. they should have a large off - set with respect to the rising part of the flare .",
    "this means that one does not find a self - consistent solution for the external shock models .",
    "the impressive consistency displayed in the above bursts lends strong support to the internal origin of these x - ray flares .",
    "it is worth noticing that a very late flare ( around 1 day ) is evident in the xrt lightcurves of grb 050502b ( falcone et al .",
    "2006 ) and the short burst grb 050724 ( barthelmy et al .",
    "there have been questions as to whether the central engine can restart at such a late epoch and whether these features are due to a refreshed external shock origin ( e.g. panaitescu et al . 1998 ; zhang & mszros 2002 ) .",
    "our results indicate remarkably that the @xmath4 s for these two late flares are also right before the rising part of the flares .",
    "this gives strong support to the internal origin of these flares , and calls for central engine models that can operate as long as @xmath5 1 day .",
    "the fitted @xmath4 s for some tails in grbs 050315 , 050712 , 050713a , 050714b , 050716 , 050721 , 050724 , 050730 , 050801 , 050814 , 050819 and 050822 are all before the peak of the corresponding flare or the starting point of the steep decay .",
    "however , they are not apparently located at the rising part of a flare or prompt emission pulse . these are all highly overlapping flares or continuously decreasing prompt emission , so that the rising segment of the flare or the prompt emission pulse is deeply buried beneath the continuous emission .",
    "these cases do not contradict the internal models and the curvature effect interpretations , although it does not directly support the scenario .",
    "further complications may come from the possibility that the electron injection does not cease abruptly , that the observational band is below the cooling frequency , and that spectral breaks may cross the band during the decay , etc .",
    "in any case , it confirms that it is difficult to search for evidence of the curvature effect using the prompt grb light curves . on the other hand ,",
    "if one believes the internal origin and curvature effect scenario ( as is self - consistently tested in other bursts ) , then the fitted @xmath4 s in these bursts give some indication of the central engine time when the flare or the last pulse of the prompt emission is powered .    in figure 2 , we display the fitted @xmath4 s as a function of @xmath30 , the duration of the prompt emission .",
    "the cases of heavily overlapped flares are not included .",
    "it is found that the two quantities are not correlated , indicating that the on - set time of the late central engine activity does not depend on the duration of the prompt central engine activity .",
    "this suggests irregular , unpredictable behaviors of the grb central engine .",
    "we have used the lightcurve in the observer s frame to perform the above fits . using the intrinsic lightcurves ( i.e. systematically changing the time axis to the cosmic proper frame time @xmath31 ) shifts the searched time zero point to @xmath32 .",
    "so our conclusion does not depend on the time dilation effect since the lightcurves are simply compressed in the cosmic proper frame .",
    "we have analyzed 36 prompt - emission / flare tails in the xrt light curves of 22 grbs detected by the _",
    "swift _ before october 1 , 2005 that show clear steep decay components .",
    "this is a sub - sample of that presented by obrien et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . assuming that the tails are predominantly caused by the curvature effect",
    ", we derive the @xmath4 s of these tails by fitting the xrt light curves with eq.(2 ) .",
    "our results ( fig.1 and table 1 ) suggest that usually the @xmath4 s are near the beginning of the rising segment of the last pulse of the prompt emission or the corresponding x - ray flare , which is consistent with the expectation of the internal dissipation models for the prompt emission and x - ray flares ( e.g. burrows et al .",
    "2005 ; zhang et al . 2006a ; fan & wei 2005 ; ioka et al .",
    "2005 ; falcone et al .",
    "2006 ; romano et al .",
    "this suggests that the grb central engine re - activates after the early prompt emission is over , sometimes up to days after the trigger ( e.g. grb 050502b & grb 050724 ) .",
    "this challenges the conventional central engine models and calls for new ideas to re - start the central engine ( e.g. king et al . 2005 ; perna et al .",
    "2006 ; fan et al .",
    "2005 ; proga & zhang 2006 ; dai et al .",
    "we also show that the on - set times of the late central engine activity do not depend on @xmath30 , suggesting an erratic , unpredictable central engine .",
    "about one - third of the light curves in the obrien et al .",
    "( 2006 ) sample do not show a distinct steep - decay component that connects the prompt emission and the afterglow .",
    "it is possible that in some grbs ( e.g. grb 050525a , blustin et al .",
    "2006 ) the xrt observations started too late to catch the prompt emission tail . nonetheless , a small fraction of xrt light curves show an apparently smooth transition from the prompt emission to the afterglow emission without a steep - decay bridge .",
    "the most prominent cases are grb 050401 ( de pasquale et al .",
    "2006 ) , 050717 ( krimm et al .",
    "2006 ) , and 050826 ( obrien et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the joined bat - xrt light curves of these grbs ( see obrien et al .",
    "2006 ) have some low - amplitude flares overlapping on an otherwise smooth single power - law decay component extending to a late epoch .",
    "if these lightcurves are still interpreted within the frame work of internal - external model , as is favored by the majority of bursts in the sample ( fig.1 ) , the prompt emission and the flares are of internal origin with a smaller emission efficiency than most other bursts ( zhang et al .",
    "for example , the lightcurve of grb 050717 could be also well modelled by the superposition of a prompt emission tail emission and an underlying afterglow component ( krimm et al .",
    "alternatively , it may be possible that the fireball in these cases is decelerated at a very early time so that both the prompt emission and the afterglow originate from the external shocks ( e.g. dermer & mitman 1999 ; 2003 ) .",
    "this requires a high ambient density and a high initial lorentz factor of the fireball .",
    "the low amplitude flares overlapping on the decaying lightcurves could be still from late internal dissipation of the central engine , or from some external shock related collisions ( wu et al .",
    "2006 ) , or else from possible density clumps in the medium ( e.g. dermer & mitman 1999 ; 2003 ) .",

    "<S> the x - ray light curves of many gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) observed by the _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) have a very steep - decay component ( tail ) following the prompt gamma - rays in the early phase and have some erratic flares occurring at a time from @xmath0 up to @xmath1 seconds . </S>",
    "<S> based on the assumption that these prompt emission tails and flares are of `` internal '' origin and that their decline behaviors are dominated by the curvature effect of the fireball , we present a self - consistency test for this scenario with a sample of 36 prompt - emission - tails / flares in 22 grb xrt light curves . </S>",
    "<S> the curvature effect suggests that the temporal decay slope of the late steep - decay part of the light curves is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the x - ray spectral index . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the zero time ( @xmath4 ) for each steep decay component by fitting the light curves with the constraint of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the @xmath4 s of the prompt emission tails and the tails of well - separated flares are usually at the rising segment of the last pulse of the prompt emission or the corresponding x - ray flare , being self - consistent with the expectation of the internal dissipation models for the prompt emission and x - ray flares . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that each x - ray flare forms a distinct new episode of central engine activity and the grb central engine remains active after the prompt emission is over , sometimes up to @xmath5 1 day after the grb trigger ( e.g. grb 050502b & grb 050724 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this challenges the conventional central engine models and calls for new ideas to re - start the central engine . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that the on - set time of the late central engine activity does not depend on the grb duration . </S>",
    "<S> we also identify a minority group of grbs whose combined bat - xrt light curves are smoothly connected without an abrupt transition between the prompt emission and the afterglow . </S>",
    "<S> these grbs may have an external origin for both the prompt emission and the afterglow . </S>"
