    "almost 40 years ago , russian scientist victor veselago proposed that a material with electric permittivity @xmath0 and magnetic permeability @xmath1 , would reverse all known optical properties  @xcite .",
    "he termed these media as left - handed materials ( lhms ) since the wave vector @xmath2 , forms a left - handed triplet with the vectors @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "that is , phase velocity and the poynting vector are antiparallel , which consequently results in counter - intuitive phenomena such as reversals of the conventional doppler shift and cherenkov radiation as well as reversed refraction .",
    "veselago pointed out that electromagnetic waves incident on a planar interface between a regular right - handed material(rhm ) and a lhm will undergo negative refraction .",
    "hence a lhm planar slab can act as a lens and focus waves from a point source .",
    "recently , pendry extended veslago s analysis and further predicted that a lhm slab can amplify evanescent waves and thus behaves like a perfect lens  @xcite .",
    "pendry proposed that the amplitudes of evanescent waves from a near - field object could be restored at its image .",
    "therefore , the spatial resolution of the superlens can overcome the diffraction limit of conventional imaging systems and reach the sub - wave length scale .",
    "the physical realization of such a lhm was demonstrated only recently for a novel class of engineered composite materials  @xcite .",
    "after the first experimental observation of negative refraction , intriguing and counterintuitive phenomenon in lhms , such as amplification of evanescent waves  @xcite , unusual photon tunneling  @xcite , and negative goos - hnchen shift  @xcite have attracted much attention . here",
    "we want to explore the reversed propagation dynamics of laguerre - gaussian beams in lhms .",
    "the propagation of laguerre - gaussian beam has been investigated in conventional rhms  @xcite .",
    "such beams have a phase dislocation on the beam axis that in related literature is sometimes referred to as an optical vortex  @xcite . for a general laguerre - gaussian beam",
    "the poynting vector has an azimuthal component .",
    "this means that there is an energy flow along the circumference of the beam as it propagates , giving rise to an orbital angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "it is found that the spiral of the poynting vector of a laguerre - gaussian beam is proportional to the gouy - phase shift  @xcite .",
    "it is known that an electromagnetic beam propagating through a focus experiences an additional @xmath5 phase shift with respect to a plane wave .",
    "this phase anomaly was discovered by gouy in 1890 and has since been referred to as the gouy - phase shift  @xcite . because of the negative index , however , we can expect an reversed gouy - phase shift in lhms  @xcite .",
    "hence it will be interesting for us to describe in detail how the poynting vector evolves as it propagates and how the reversed gouy - phase shift affects its spiral in lhms .    in this work",
    ", we will reveal reversed propagation dynamics of laguerre - gaussian beam in lhms , such as inverse screw of wave - front , inverse spiral of poynting vector , and inverse rotation of vortex field .",
    "first , starting from the representation of plane - wave angular spectrum , we obtain the analytical description for a laguerre - gaussian beam propagating in lhms .",
    "our formalism permits us to introduce the reversed gouy - phase shift to describe the wave propagation .",
    "next , we will recover how the wave - front and poynting vector evolves , and how the reversed gouy - phase shift affects their propagation behavior .",
    "then , we attempt to investigate how the negative index influences the linear momentum and angular momentum of laguerre - gaussian beams .",
    "finally , we will explore how the negative index gives rise to the reversed rotation of the vortex field . for a comparison",
    ", the corresponding propagation characteristics in rhms will also been discussed .",
    "to investigate the propagation dynamics of a laguerre - gaussian beam in lhms , we use the maxwell s equations to determine the field distribution both inside and outside the lhm .",
    "we consider a monochromatic electromagnetic field @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath7 $ ] of angular frequency @xmath8 propagating from the rhm to the lhm .",
    "the field can be described by maxwell s equations @xmath9 from the maxwell s equations , we can easily find that the wave propagation is only permitted in the medium with @xmath10 or @xmath11 . in the former case , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 form a right - handed triplet , while in the latter case , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 form a left - handed triplet .",
    "we introduce the lorentz - gauge vector potential to describe the propagation characteristics of laguerre - gaussian in rhms and lhms .",
