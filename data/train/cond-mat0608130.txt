    "the effective interaction between probe particles in a fluid has been a subject of theoretical and experimental studies for some time .",
    "if a liquid is far from thermal equilibrium then the interactions involving probe particles can not be described by classical thermodynamic approaches such as the potential distribution theorem @xcite .",
    "even the large scale random motion of a single particle can not naively be assumed to be brownian motion as temporal correlations between successive collisions of the probe particle with the fluid particles can not safely be ignored . at present",
    "too little is known in general terms about random motion in non - equilibrium fluids .",
    "some progress may be achieved by considering stylized lattice gas models of fluids .",
    "such models sometimes are amenable to analytical treatment and may thus give some insight into universal features of the stochastic motion and the effective fluid - mediated interaction of probe particles .",
    "a paradigmatic microscopic lattice gas model is the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) @xcite , the large - scale dynamics of which are governed by the burgers equation @xcite . in particular , in one dimension the motion of so - called second class particles is well understood .",
    "such a probe particle moves with an average speed given by the collective velocity @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the steady state current of the lattice gas with density @xmath4 .",
    "the fluctuations of the position around its mean are superdiffusive with the dynamical exponent @xmath0 of the universality class of the noisy kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is intricately linked to the nature of the current fluctuations in the kpz universality class . moreover",
    ", the second class particle is attracted to regions of large density gradient ( on molecular scale ) , thus serving as a microscopic marker of shocks @xcite .    when a large system contains two probe particles , the local density gradient in the density of the fluid particles induces an effective long - range attractive interaction between the probes .",
    "the steady - state distribution of the distance @xmath5 between the two second class particles was found to decay as @xmath6 for large @xmath5 @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was suggested that this algebraic behaviour generalizes to @xmath7 for other driven diffusive systems with a non - universal exponent @xmath8 .",
    "this leads to phase separation for @xmath9 .",
    "for the _ dynamics _ of two probe particles , initially introduced into a pure system at a finite distance , this implies an increase of the mean distance ( @xmath10 ) or the formation of bound state with finite mean distance ( @xmath9 ) . in recent work",
    "@xcite an attempt was made to determine the stochastic motion of two probe particles by a fokker - planck approach .",
    "this approach implies dynamical scaling with @xmath1 and yields a differential equation for the scaling form of the dynamical probability distribution for the distance of the probe particles . in particular",
    ", one obtains the growth law for the mean distance @xmath11 and the growth exponent @xmath12 as a function of @xmath8 .    here",
    "we argue that the analysis of @xcite applies under certain conditions to the dynamics of probe particles which has a random part that is _ uncorrelated _ in time . a simple model for which such dynamics applies is given below . on the other hand , for probe particles driven by stochastic forces originating solely from the dynamics of the surrounding fluid particles , as in the case of probe particles embedded in a ring ,",
    "the scaling behaviour is determined by the dynamical exponent of the fluid .",
    "namely , one has @xmath0 for generic driven lattice gases rather than the non - generic edwards - wilkinson exponent @xmath1 .",
    "this picture is theoretically founded below in a more detailed consideration of the statistical properties of the underlying current fluctuations and supported by dynamical monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ model ]",
    "we define a generalization of the asep with probe particles , originally introduced in @xcite .",
    "moreover we introduce a variant of the model , with the same transitions , but driven by a different source of noise . in section  [ kpz ]",
    "we use dynamical scaling to determine the growth exponent @xmath12 for the driven fluid with @xmath0 . in section  [ segment ] we analyze the dynamical behaviour of the modified model which is governed by the @xmath1 dynamical exponent . in section  [ conc ]",
    "we reconsider the results of @xcite and present our conclusions .",
    "following @xcite we define our model on a one dimensional ( 1d ) lattice",
    ". a hard core repulsion of particles is incorporated by an exclusion interaction such that each lattice site can be occupied by either a positive particle ( @xmath13 ) , a negative particle ( @xmath14 ) , or it may be occupied by a probe particle ( @xmath15 ) . the continuous time stochastic dynamics of the model",
    "is defined by nearest neighbor jumps where the particles are exchanged with rates @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the energy of the initial configuration minus that of the final one , defined by the nearest neighbor ising interaction potential @xmath18 where @xmath19 according to the occupation of site @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "we consider the range @xmath22 of the coupling constant .",
    "we mention that in the case where @xmath23 ( not studied here ) the current - density relation of a domain of particles exhibits two degenerate maxima .",
    "this could lead to a phase separation of the two maximal current phases within the domains , which makes the analysis more involved . for a discussion of this case",
    "we refer to reference  @xcite .",
    "this model reduces to the kls model @xcite in the case where no probe particles are present .",
    "then the steady state has an ising measure @xcite .",
    "this is also expected to be the local steady - state measure away from any probe when the density of probes is zero .",
    "as in most studies of this model we consider equal densities of positive and negative particles . in monte carlo simulations to be discussed below , one considers @xmath24 sites with periodic boundary conditions and random sequential update dynamics .    in the absence of nearest neighbor interaction , @xmath25 ,",
    "the dynamics defined above reduces to that of the tasep with second - class particles which are the probes .",
    "the steady state of this system is fully known @xcite .",
    "the statistical weight of all configurations with a given segment length @xmath26 between the two probe particles is proportional to @xmath27 , the partition function of the tasep on an open chain of length @xmath26 in the maximal current phase @xcite .",
    "this observation has been used to show that the probability to find the two probes at a distance @xmath26 from each other decays for large @xmath26 as @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "in addition , this result can be used to estimate the currents of particles which go in and out of the segment trapped between the two probe particles .",
    "one finds that the outgoing current of @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) particles through the right ( left ) probe takes the form of the steady state current of the tasep . to leading order in @xmath29",
    "it is given by @xmath30 .",
    "the opposing currents , namely that of @xmath14 ( @xmath13 ) particles incoming through the right ( left ) probe , take the form @xmath31 . in the limit we are concerned with , namely @xmath32 and @xmath33 , this current is well approximated by @xmath34 .",
    "following @xcite one expects similar behaviour for @xmath35 .",
    "namely , that the current of @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) particles bypassing the right ( left ) probe takes the same form as that of the current in an open segment of the same length , governed by the same dynamics .",
    "this current is given by ( again to leading order in @xmath29 ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "for the relevant values of @xmath39 one has @xmath40 . also , similar to the @xmath25 case , the incoming current is given in the large @xmath24 limit by @xmath41 equation ( [ jout ] ) has been derived in @xcite , where @xmath8 is proportional to the coefficient of the non - linear term in the kpz equation .",
    "the dynamics of two probe particles embedded in an infinitely long ring may therefore be rephrased as follows : the left probe particle jumps to the left ( thus increasing the size of the cluster between the two probes by one lattice unit ) after a random time determined by the current of the ( infinite ) environment .",
    "the mean of that random time is @xmath42 .",
    "it jumps to the right ( thus decreasing the cluster size by one lattice unit ) after a random time with mean @xmath43 which depends on the size of the cluster .",
    "the motion of the right probe particles can be described similarly .",
    "therefore the distance @xmath26 between the two probes is a random process which is increased by one unit by the incoming current .",
    "this happens after a random time with mean @xmath44 , independent of the cluster size .",
    "the distance is decreased by one unit after a cluster size dependent random time with mean @xmath45 .",
    "we stress that the incoming and outgoing currents are correlated in time and hence do _ not _ generate a memoryless markovian random motion of the probe particles . as discussed below the dynamics of the probe particles is controlled in this case by the dynamical exponent @xmath0 of the kpz universality class .",
    "an interesting modification of the model is given by the following stochastic dynamics : the motion of the probe particles that lead to an increase of the cluster is taken to be a poisson process with constant mean waiting time @xmath46 .",
    "the motion that leads to a decrease of the cluster size is unchanged in the sense that it is generated by the jump events inside the cluster .",
    "thus while the combined stochastic motion of the probe particles is also non - markovian , the noise has a contribution that is uncorrelated in time .",
    "below we shall refer to this dynamics as mixed .",
    "this mixed dynamics can be described within a similar framework of the model defined above .",
    "consider a fluid segment of fluctuating length composed of @xmath47 particles denoted by @xmath48 embedded in an environment of `` probe particles '' @xmath15 .",
    "the bulk dynamics of the particles within the segment is defined as before by the kls hopping rules .",
    "the left boundary dynamics of a cluster @xmath48 with length @xmath26 is defined as follows : @xmath49 similarly at the right boundary one takes @xmath50 note that a fluid segment of length @xmath51 can only increase in size .",
    "this model is considered in more detail in section  [ segment ] .",
    "in the steady state the large distance distribution of the two probes decays algebraically @xmath52 with the non - universal exponent @xmath8 given in ( [ eq : j ] ) . for @xmath10",
    "this leads to an infinite mean distance as time tends to infinity . in order to calculate the temporal evolution of the asymptotic mean distance we make a scaling ansatz @xmath53 for the large scale probability density of the distance @xmath5 between the probes at time @xmath54 . in this scaling picture",
    "the distance is considered to be continuous and correspondingly the notation is changed from @xmath26 to @xmath5 . the scaling function @xmath55 satisfies the boundary condition @xmath56 , and the normalization condition @xmath57 . here a cutoff @xmath58 is introduced to prevent divergence at @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",
    "this generalizes the scaling ansatz of reference  @xcite .    in the range @xmath61",
    "the normalization condition yields @xmath62 while for @xmath63 one finds @xmath64 . from this",
    "we calculate the mean distance between the particles , @xmath65 . inspecting the large @xmath54 behaviour of this integral",
    "one finds @xmath66 here @xmath67 is a non - universal constant .",
    "hence for @xmath10 the mean distance increases algebraically in time with exponent @xmath68 ( @xmath63 ) or @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) respectively . at @xmath71",
    "there are logarithmic corrections . for @xmath9 the two particles",
    "are bound to each other with a finite average distance while for @xmath70 the particles are weakly bound .    since the motion of the probe particle is driven by the fluctuations of the current we argue that the scaling form of the probability distribution for the distance between two probes should be determined by the dynamical exponent of the fluid .",
    "this leads to the identification of @xmath72 with the kpz dynamical exponent .",
    "let us briefly elaborate on this point . consider the position of , say , the left probe particle .",
    "the rate of change of its position is given by the difference between the incoming currents into the segment confined by the probes and the outgoing currents from this segment at the left end .",
    "the incoming current originates from a very large kpz fluid and hence the variance of this quantity grows as @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "the outgoing current originates from the segment of finite length , and is highly correlated with the incoming currents . in the following",
    "we show that the distribution of the position of the probe particle is determined by the kpz exponent of the incoming current , @xmath0 . to this end",
    "we study numerically the fluctuations of the incoming and the outgoing currents at , say , the left end separately .",
    "we define @xmath74 as the number of steps of the left probe which increase the distance between the probes up to time @xmath54 .",
    "these are the moves to the left .",
    "similarly we define @xmath75 as the number of length decreasing steps up to time @xmath54 , i.e. the time integrated number of steps to the right .",
    "analogously we define the quantities @xmath76 for the right probe .",
    "we have calculated the variances and the covariances of the four random variables @xmath77 and @xmath78 in simulations .",
    "we find that all these quantities increase to leading order as @xmath73 ( see figure  [ fig : xx ] ) .",

    "this requires the cancellation of the leading term contribution of @xmath87 , which is in agreement with the results of the numerical simulations presented in figure  [ fig : xx](a ) , where the amplitudes of all the variances and covariances appear to be the same .",
