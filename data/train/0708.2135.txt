    "r coronae borealis ( rcb ) stars are hydrogen - deficient , carbon - rich variables that undergo declines in visual brightness up to 7 mag or more at irregular intervals .",
    "the evolutionary pathways of these stars are still unclear , with the white dwarf merger model and the final helium - shell flash model being suggested for the extreme abundances ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the darkening phenomenon has been attributed to eclipse by clouds of dust grains ( dust puff ) formed along the line of sight @xcite . near - infrared excess ,",
    "attributable to the dust emission at an equivalent blackbody temperature of @xmath3 k , was found for the prototype of this group , r crb @xcite , and this excess is a general property of rcb stars @xcite .",
    "the infrared radiation shows variations on timescales of @xmath4 yr @xcite and does not clearly correlate with the optical brightness @xcite . these indicate that a large amount of dust being produced surrounds the star and that a smaller dust puff is formed in a random direction per any one ejection event ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent near - infrared adaptive optics observations with an 8-m class telescope directly revealed the presence of multiple dusty clouds in the vicinity of ry sgr @xcite .",
    "the dust formation mechanism itself is , however , still one of the fundamental problems in rcb stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite derived from a theoretical argument a conclusion that the dust formation has to occur somewhere @xmath5 apart from the central star where the local temperature becomes low enough to allow for carbon grains to condense . on the other hand , observational facts such as the time evolution of chromospheric emission lines and timescales of brightness recovering from declines",
    "are favorable to other models in which dust forms in close proximity ( @xmath6 ) to the central star @xcite .",
    "to settle this discrepancy , some mechanism to promote dust formation near rcb stars have been proposed .",
    "@xcite suggested that the local gas temperature can be substantially decreased by supercooling after the passage of a shock wave driven by stellar pulsation .",
    "@xcite proposed an episodic local density inversions in the ionization layer of helium due to a kind of radiative instability which can promote a blob ejection .",
    "@xcite discussed the dust formation above the cool regions of giant convection cells .",
    "@xcite suggest that cool magnetic spots existing inside of photosphere facilitate dust formation above the spots after a shock wave passes .",
    "polarimetry is a probe sensitive to circumstellar medium near the stellar surface , and even to dust formation episodes around rcb stars on very small spatial scales .",
    "if dust forms actually near the photosphere ( @xmath6 ) , the angular size of the dust puff should be more than @xmath7 for total eclipse of the stellar disk .",
    "such a wide dust puff is likely to scatter the light from the star and may cause a net polarization more than @xmath8@xmath9 % , when it locates along the direction nearly orthogonal to the line of sight @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is natural to expect that rcb stars temporally show a significant polarization at maximum brightness stage .",
    "the wavelength dependence of the polarization would give unique information about the `` newborn '' dust grain .",
    "so far only small fluctuation of intrinsic polarization less than 0.2 % has been found for rcbs near maximum brightness @xcite , except for @xcite s observation on 1974 august 24 ( @xmath10 % ) .    in this paper , we present a new spectropolarimetry of r crb on 84 nights in 19982003 .",
    "we successfully found two events of temporal increase in polarization by about 0.5 %  at maximum brightness stage .",
    "we consider the period when the visual magnitude is within 0.3 mag below the maximum @xmath11 magnitude ( @xmath12 ) as `` maximum brightness '' phase and call the other period `` decline '' phase .",
    "we adopt @xmath13 which is the mean magnitude during the apparent visual maximum of r crb , jd2,450,80051,000 and 52,00052,650 ( figure [ fig1]a ) .",
    "the photometric data referred in this paper are obtained from the vsnet ] and aavso ] databases .",
    "the data were obtained with the low - resolution spectropolarimeter , hbs ( an acronym of `` henkou - bunkou - sokkou - ki '' which stands for spectropolarimeter in japanese ; @xcite ) from 1998 january 28 to 2003 september 29 at the dodaira observatory and the okayama astrophysical observatory of naoj . at the dodaira observatory ,",
    "hbs was attached to the cassegrain focus of the 0.91 m telescope ( @xmath14 ; @xmath15 mm@xmath2 at the focal plane ) . at okayama astrophysical observatory ,",
    "hbs was attached to the cassegrain focus of either the 0.91 m telescope ( @xmath16 ; @xmath17 mm@xmath2 ) or the 1.88 m telescope ( @xmath14 ; @xmath18 mm@xmath2 ) .",
    "hbs has a superachromatic half - wave plate and a quarts wollaston prism ; the orthogonally polarized spectra are simultaneously recorded on either a front - illuminated type ti ccd ( 1024@xmath191024 pixels , 12 @xmath20 square per pixel ) or a back - illuminated type site ccd ( 512@xmath19512 pixels , 24 @xmath20 square per pixel ) .",
    "we used either the 1.4 mm@xmath21 circular hole ( d1 ) or the 0.2 mm @xmath19 1.4 mm rectangular hole ( d2 ) as a focal diaphragm .",
    "each diaphragm has two holes of the same dimension , and we put a target star in one hole and the nearby sky in the other . for the observations with d1 diaphragm , the spectral resolution depends on the seeing size because the stellar image size is much smaller than the diameter of the circular hole . for the observations with d2 , the spectral resolution also depends on the stellar image size at the okayama 0.91 m telescope , while it does not at the other telescopes because the stellar image size was usually larger than the narrower dimension of the rectangular hole .",
    "nevertheless , the spectral resolution falls in the range between 50    and 150    in the all observations .    a unit of the observing sequence consisted of successive integrations at four position angles ( pa ) , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , of the half - wave plate .",
    "the obtained images were processed using the reduction package for hbs data , which was outlined in @xcite .",
    "instrumental polarization was derived from unpolarized standard star data obtained almost in each night .",
    "the data were averaged in each observation run ( typically @xmath26 days for the okayama 1.88 m telescope and 1 - 2 months for the other telescopes ) .",
    "the level of instrumental polarization @xmath27 was well expressed by a smooth function of wavelength , and vectorially removed from observed stokes @xmath28 and @xmath29 spectra . at any run ,",
    "the stability ( @xmath30 ) of @xmath27 was less than 0.05 % .",
    "the factor of instrumental depolarization was obtained from observation through a glan - taylor prism .",
    "this observation also gave us the wavelength - dependent pa of the equivalent optical axis of the superachromatic half - wave plate .",
    "the zero point of the pa on the sky was determined from observations of strongly polarized standard stars listed in @xcite .",
    "the instrumental polarization , the instrumental depolarization , and the zero point of the pa were properly corrected for in the reduction package .",
    "the observations are summarized in table [ tbl-1 ] , in which polarization data integrated over the synthetic johnson _ v _ band filter @xcite are shown . for the observations with d2 diaphragm",
    ", we also show the equivalent widths of the c@xmath31 5165   band in the table .",
    "the flux was calibrated using spectrophotometry of some standard stars @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the time variation of polarization at the synthetic _ v _ band , together with the visual light curve .",
    "r crb experienced three major photometric declines in our observation period .",
    "it demonstrates large polarization variability during declines ; for example , the polarization angle rotated by more than 30@xmath32 in 1999 december and the polarization amplitude became over 5 % in 2000 december .",
    "on the other hand , r crb near maximum brightness showed nearly constant polarization ( except for on 2001 march 912 and august 9 ) .",
    "these characteristics are consistent with past observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a commonly - accepted explanation for the large polarization during decline is that the unpolarized direct stellar light is heavily obscured by the dust cloud ( dust puff ) along the line of sight and the visible flux is predominantly scattered light .",
    "however , we detected temporal increase of polarization two times even at maximum brightness stages ; the first event was observed on 2001 march 912 and the second was on 2001 august 9 . in both times , the amplitude of polarization increased by @xmath33 % ( figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "although polarization usually increases accompanied with the onset of major decline phases ( figure [ fig3 ] ) , we can not see any significant decline ( @xmath34 ) in the lightcurve around the two events .",
    "also , any remarkable change in flux spectra have not been recognized as shown in figure [ fig4 ] , and the equivalent width of c@xmath35 5165   absorption band ( table [ tbl-1 ] ) kept an almost constant value , 2226  , which is consistent with the typical value of r crb near maximum brightness ( 17.543   with an average of 26.5  ; @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that there is possible photometric variations accompanied with the polarimetric variations .",
    "the lightcurve shows possible shallow dips ( @xmath360.1 mag ) a few days prior to the polarization events ( figure [ fig2 ] ) , which could be connected with small dust formation episodes .",
    "we will discuss this temporal polarimetric activities after subtraction of the constant polarization component .",
    "it has been known that r crb shows a nearly constant polarization at maximum brightness .",
    "@xcite averaged the polarization observed in a period when no brightness fluctuations were seen , and derived a constant component of @xmath37 % , @xmath38 % ( @xmath39 % , @xmath40 ) as the values averaged over the optical wavelengths . the same values were obtained from averaging subsequent non - decline observations in 19901993 @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that the observation in 1995 march , before the onset of the decline of 1995 , showed a typical serkowski - type isp function ( @xmath41 % , @xmath42 @xmath20 , @xmath43 ) which was in good agreement with the previous estimations .",
    "@xcite assumed the interstellar component of @xmath44 % and @xmath45 from polarization of nearby field stars .",
    "similar technique also gives @xmath46 % and @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "we averaged our polarization data obtained on 46 nights when r crb was at maximum brightness stage ( @xmath48 mag ) except those in the periods of the transient polarization .",
    "the mean values for stokes @xmath28 and @xmath29 parameters and their standard deviations in each band are @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "parameters of serkowski function @xcite corresponding to those values are derived by a non - linear regression as @xmath53 % , @xmath54 @xmath20 and @xmath55",
    ". these are consistent with the constant and/or interstellar component derived in previous studies .",
    "the constancy of the component over two decades , being much more than the @xmath363.5 yr ir period , allows us to consider that the component is fully interstellar polarization .",
    "it is noted that @xcite found a small variability of polarization up to 0.14 %  ( possibly correlated with the light curve , at least , for their 1991 data ) during the maximum brightness stage .",
    "the variability seems rather random , and such an effect would be cancelled out in our averaged values , while they possibly remain in the standard deviations .",
    "after vectorial subtraction of the constant component from the observations , we obtain variable components of polarization , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "their values in synthetic @xmath11 band are shown in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "it is known that polarized flux of r crb is relatively constant since 1968 at the level of @xmath58 to @xmath59 at any part of declines @xcite , where @xmath60 is the total stellar flux at maximum brightness stage . here , the polarized flux is simply derived as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the drop of visual magnitude from maximum @xmath63 ( see   1 ) . in our data",
    "( figure [ fig1]d ) , @xmath64 also falls between @xmath65 and @xmath59 on almost all days both during and out of declines .",
    "however , at the epochs of the transient polarization , @xmath64 showed @xmath365 times as much as the typical maximum values , which indicates that the net polarization flux was extraordinarily large .",
    "our polarimetric monitoring brought first detection of the ` transient polarization ' amounting to 0.5 % for r crb in the maximum brightness phase .",
    "as far as we know , there exists only one observation in which r crb near maximum brightness showed polarimetric variation larger than @xmath66 % : @xcite found @xmath67 %   at @xmath685450   on 1974 august 24 @xmath69 jd@xmath70 .",
    "figures [ fig5]a and [ fig5]b show the time variation of @xmath71 and @xmath57 in the periods including the first and second events of the transient polarization .",
    "there is no significant wavelength dependence in position angle for both events , compared with the polarization found during decline phase ( figures [ fig6]a  c ) .",
    "suppose that several clouds exist around r crb and that they scatter the light from the star . if each cloud was ejected from the photosphere in a random manner and it contains a different polarizing property from one to another , the position angle of the scattered light would be mostly wavelength dependent .",
    "the nearly constant @xmath72 against @xmath73 indicates that the polarization can be ` effectively ' attributed to scattering by one component .",
    "the wavelength dependence of @xmath71 was almost flat in optical wavelengths and quite similar between the two cases .",
    "for the event on 1974 august 24 , @xmath74 seems also flat ( 0.380.46 % ) in the wavelength range , 36307450   @xcite .",
    "the similarity in @xmath75 curve suggests an existence of the possible generality in the polarizing mechanism among those three events .",
    "rayleigh scattering by large molecules or smallest solid particles ( @xmath76 ) can not reproduce such wavelength dependence because the scattering coefficient is highly wavelength - dependent ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "scattering by free electrons can reproduce a flat @xmath75 curve .",
    "however , it is unlikely for r crb to have a large amount of ionized gas which can produce an observable polarization because the effective temperature of r crb is not so high ( @xmath78 k ; @xcite ) .",
    "the emission lines which appears in r crb during declines ( e.g. , @xcite ) are not so strong that spectra at maximum brightness stage have little emission line .",
    "as described in  1 , several observational facts suggest that r crb intermittently ejects dust puffs even at maximum brightness phases .",
    "the transient polarization could be naturally explained by a dust puff ejection off the line of sight .",
    "the shallow dips in the lightcurve ( figure [ fig2 ] ) would support this idea , if we can assume that the dust puff eclipses a small part of the photosphere at the very early ( nearest ) stage .",
    "single - sized grain of radius @xmath79 shows a peak polarization at optical wavelength and the peak wavelength varies with the grain radius ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for flat @xmath71 curve ,",
    "the dust grains would have a size distribution of a wide range of @xmath80 .",
    "we performed a calculation of mie scattering with a simplified model consisting of a point - like dust cloud and a central star , and estimated the light from the stellar system ; that is the sum of an unpolarized direct stellar light and the partially - polarized scattered light . in the calculation we assumed that the dust grains are all spherical amorphous carbon ( e.g. , @xcite ) and adopted the refractive indices of the be soot @xcite .",
    "we also assumed that the cloud is optically - thin , i.e. , multiple scattering process is negligible .",
    "we set the distance of the cloud @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the stellar radius ( @xmath83 ; @xcite ) and make an estimation of the total mass of dust necessary for explaining the @xmath8 % polarization .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig7 ] . in the case of forward - scattering ( scattering angle @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the angle between the direction of the incident light and that of the scattered one ) , the @xmath74 curves gradually decrease with wavelength and they do not fit well the observation . for a right angle scattering and backward - scattering ( @xmath86 ) cases , the single - sized grain model fails to reproduce the flat @xmath87 curve .",
    "the size distribution of the carbon dust should range over @xmath360.13 @xmath20 in order to produce the flat @xmath71 curve .",
    "we here consider a power - law size distribution like a well - known interstellar dust model ( @xcite ; hereafter , mrn ) .",
    "the mrn size distribution is expressed as @xmath88 within @xmath89 , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "results of the mrn model seem not to contradict the observation in a wide range of scattering angle ( @xmath92@xmath93 ) .",
    "this is only an illustrative example .",
    "a large choice of parameters ( @xmath94 ) can yield similar @xmath75 curves .",
    "in general , the scattering by grains having various sizes seems a plausible mechanism for the transient polarization .",
    "the similarity in the observed @xmath74 curves between / among two ( or three , including @xcite s event ) events suggest that the dependence of @xmath74 on the scattering angle is not so strong .",
    "a correlation between pulsational phase and the time of decline onset has been found for ry sgr and v854 cen which show fairly regular pulsation cycles than r crb @xcite .",
    "although the correlation is less significant for r crb itself @xcite , it is recently confirmed by @xcite .",
    "these suggest that the condensation of dust is triggered by the stellar pulsation . according to this picture , the appearance of the transient polarization is likely to correlate with the pulsation phase . in our observation ,",
    "the interval between the two polarization events was @xmath95 d. it has been known that r crb shows a semi - regular pulsation of about 40 d from photometric and spectroscopic observations , for example @xmath96 d @xcite , @xmath97 d @xcite and @xmath98 d @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the 151 d interval corresponds to four cycles , the length of one cycle is @xmath99 d. this seems a little shorter compared with the pulsation period . however , it is noted again that the pulsation period of r crb is not coherent .",
    "some shorter periods have been found in a timescale of a few hundred days .",
    "@xcite found well - developed oscillations with an apparent period of @xmath100 d in late 1992 in the visual light curve ; while they also found that the better - defined peaks observed from 1992 through 1993 could be fitted with a single , linear ephemeris of period @xmath101 d. we can not exclude the possibility that the transient polarization was correlated with the stellar pulsation .      in the previous section , we showed that the wavelength dependence of the transient polarization can be reproduced by light scattering due to the carbon grain with various sizes including grains larger than @xmath360.13 . however , uv extinction properties at the 1980 decline of r crb indicate that the dust was grassy or amorphous carbon grain with a size distribution of @xmath102@xmath103 @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of extinction curves @xcite for three observations of r crb during declines in 19801984 indicated that the size distribution of graphite or amorphous carbon grains has a distinct peak - like form ( widths of @xmath104@xmath105 ) with typical sizes of @xmath106 through @xmath107 .",
    "if such small particles scatter the light from the central star , the @xmath71 curve should show a slope of decreasing with wavelength in the optical ( figure [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the amplitude of polarization is proportional to inverse square of the distance between the central star and the dust puff , @xmath108 , while the extinction depends only on the column density along the line of sight .",
    "the information derived from the extinction would be a mean property of the dust clouds along the line of sight toward the star , while the information derived from the polarization would be selectively for the dust close to the central star .",
    "therefore the apparent difference in dust size between the estimate from polarimetry and that from uv extinction may indicate that the size distribution of the dust changes with the distance from the central star .",
    "@xcite reported the variability of the wavelength dependence of polarization in 1972 decline of r crb , and interpreted each observation with scattering by graphite dust of different sizes ranging from @xmath109 to @xmath110 in radius . in their results",
    "the mean particle size became smaller unsteadily with time .",
    "@xcite proposed that the extinction properties of the dust responsible for 1982 decline of the hot rcb star , mv sgr , can be explained by somewhat large carbon grains ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "another model applied for the same extinction data also gave a similar result @xcite .",
    "for some extinction data of other rcb stars , he also suggested that the particle size exceeds @xmath112 .",
    "these facts suggest that the scattering matter consist of discrete clouds with different mean particle sizes ( depending on their ages and their distance from the star ) even in the same star .",
    "if the dust forms near the photosphere , a grain evaporation mechanism might play a role on the change of the size distribution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the particle size inferred from our polarimetry suggests that the evolutionary phase of the dust grains causing the transient polarization is more or less the same from that of the dust grains obscuring the stellar flux during deep declines .      the transient polarization in 2001 march diminished gradually between march 11 and 13 .",
    "for the second event , the polarization also diminished within two days .",
    "it is remarkable that the decaying timescale of the transient polarization is only @xmath113 days , which is much shorter than the recovery times of the brightness from deep minimum ( typically several weeks ) .",
    "if we assume that the scattering geometry keeps similar , the polarized flux approximately depends on the product of intensity of the stellar light at the scattering material and total scattering cross section .",
    "thus , the amplitude of polarization decreases as the dust cloud goes away from the star ( i.e. , larger @xmath108 ) or the dust particles are destroyed ( i.e. , smaller @xmath80 ) .    here",
    "we consider the former case .",
    "if the decrease of polarization was only due to radial dispersal of dust cloud , the rate of decrease in polarization roughly depends on the radial distance @xmath108 and the mean expansion velocity of the cloud @xmath114 .",
    "the distance can be expressed as @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the distance between the central star and the place where the dust formation finishes , and @xmath117 is the time elapsed from the cessation of the dust formation . for simplicity , we assume that the scattering cloud is optically thin . in this case , the polarization amplitude approximately changes as @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is a constant and @xmath120 is the finite disk depolarization factor @xcite .",
    "should be damped more slowly than @xmath121 in the vicinity of the star and we obtain the lower - limit of @xmath114 with this method anyhow . ]",
    "this function monotonically decreases with @xmath108 for @xmath122 , and the most rapidly decreasing case occurs for nearly @xmath123 .",
    "the observed transient polarization decreased to one fourth within @xmath113 days .",
    "these indicate that the dust cloud needs to travel , at least , @xmath124 within two days , i.e. , @xmath125 km s@xmath2 .",
    "thus , if the expansion velocity exceeds @xmath126",
    "km s@xmath2 , the dispersal of dust cloud can explain the timescale of the polarization extinction .",
    "however , the derived velocity is not consistent with the typical mass loss velocity observed in r crb .",
    "the absorption component of the d or the @xmath7310830 line are blueshifted by up to @xmath127 to @xmath128 km s@xmath2 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "evolutions of emission line system at the onset of declines suggest that the wind velocity is likely to be lower ( @xmath129 km s@xmath2 ) at close proximity to the photosphere , @xmath130@xmath131 @xcite .",
    "although higher - velocity wind have been reported in the unusual rcb stars , v854 cen ( 4001000 km s@xmath2 , @xcite ) , the observational facts suggests the ejecta of r crb is gradually accelerated up to @xmath132 km s@xmath2 within a few weeks ( probably by radiation pressure on dust grains ) .",
    "it is unlikely that the dust puff is accelerated to @xmath125 km s@xmath2 within @xmath133 .",
    "therefore , the rate of depolarization can hardly be explained only by the radial expansion of the dust puff . if the dust forms actually near the photosphere ( @xmath6 ) , the strong radiation from the central star can evaporate and destroy the dust grains once the possible cooling instability to promote the dust condensation ( see  1 ) terminates . in any case , the rapid disappearance of polarization prefers that the dust grains are formed in an activated region , that is , a region close to the photosphere .",
    "the problem of dust formation in such hostile environments is also under discussion in the field of wolf - rayet stars .",
    "some phenomenological similarities with rcb stars have been reported for some late - type wc stars and [ wc ] pn nuclei ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "polarization is relatively sensitive to the region close to the light source for some optically - thin systems , and the transient polarization events represent the potential of polarimetry as the probe to the dust formation around such stars .",
    "@xcite presented that the pa of polarization in r crb observed during decline of 1986 was along with data of two previous declines of 1968 and 1972 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that there was a preferred plane ( pa @xmath134@xmath24 ) in the dust ejection . however , the pas observed during 1989 and 1993 declines were significantly different from them @xcite .",
    "@xcite summarized a data set in five declines with polarimetry ( from 1971 through 1996 ) having wavelength information when r crb was more than 5 mag below maximum brightness , and presented that they well fit to the two opposite sector regions of pa @xmath135 and @xmath136 in @xmath137 diagram .",
    "they suggested that dust ejection in r crb has a bipolar geometry consisting of obscuring torus and bipolar lobes .",
    "we can see a similar tendency in our data at decline phases ( figure [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "the pa of the largest polarization found during the 2000 decline ( @xmath138@xmath139 ) falls in the sector regions .",
    "the pa in the recovering phase of the 2003 decline ( @xmath140@xmath141 ) also falls near the sector regions .",
    "these implies that the bipolar geometry for dust ejection directions still exists in r crb .",
    "it is noted that the transient polarization was at @xmath142@xmath138 ( 2001 march ) and @xmath143 ( 2001 august ) , which lies near or only slightly apart from the edge of the sector regions . during",
    "deep declines a considerable rotation ( @xmath144 ) of the pa with wavelength has been occasionally found in some rcb stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this can be explained by an optical depth effect where a thick torus obscures the central star and thin bipolar lobes act as a reflection nebula @xcite . on the other hand , for the transient polarization",
    ", the rotation of the pa with wavelength is small .",
    "it supports the idea that only a single dust puff , which is closest to the photosphere , contributes the transient polarization effectively .",
    "the size distribution discussed in  4.2 would reflect the real properties of the newborn grains selectively .",
    "@xcite carried out _",
    "k_-band speckle interferometric observations of r crb on 1996 october 1 ( @xmath145 ) and 1999 september 28 ( @xmath146 ) and suggested that the large dust shell ( with an inner boundary at @xmath147 and 920 k ) has a rather isotropic distribution , at least , in a scale of larger than @xmath148 .",
    "the authors also introduced a newly formed dust cloud close to the star ( @xmath149 and 1200 k ) to fit both the visibility and the spectral energy distribution simultaneously .",
    "@xcite gave an analysis of sed with a model atmosphere and suggested that the ir excess could be explained by recently formed , hot dust grains ( @xmath150k ) amounting to a total mass of @xmath151 .",
    "some extinction models for rcb stars suggested that the total mass ( gas@xmath152dust ) per ejection event were @xmath153@xmath154 @xcite although these could be affected by uncertainties in @xmath108 , @xmath21 ( opening angle of the dust puff ) , and the gas - to - dust ratio . @xcite",
    "derived a mean dust formation rate of @xmath155 yr@xmath2 with a radiative transfer modeling .",
    "our monte carlo simulation ( see appendix ) suggests that the dust puff off the line of sight can produce a polarization of @xmath156% when it has a mass of @xmath157 and an opening angle of @xmath144 for @xmath158 .",
    "the actual mass should be highly model dependent .",
    "however , the lower - limit of the dust mass is still much less than the mean dust formation rate ( @xmath159 yr@xmath2 ) , and we conclude that the amplitude of polarization in the transient polarization events would be consistent with the random ejection model in which dust puffs are formed in the close vicinity of the stellar atmosphere .",
    "we carried out spectropolarimetric monitoring of r crb from 1998 january to 2003 september .",
    "the constant component of polarization derived by @xcite and confirmed by @xcite still existed in our observational period .",
    "in addition , we discovered a temporal increase of polarization up to @xmath156 % at maximum brightness stage in 2001 march and august .",
    "it is likely that dust puff which was ejected off the line of sight produced the transient polarization .",
    "shallow declines ( @xmath360.1 mag ) were marginally found a few days prior to the polarization events , which would support this idea if we can assume that the dust puff eclipsed a part of the photosphere at the very early stage .",
    "the flatness in @xmath71 curve of the transient polarization , which was a common property for both two cases , suggested that the size distribution of the dust was not like a @xmath160-function ( as the results of uv  optical extinction studies ) but rather wide , e.g. , a well - known model of interstellar dust ( mrn size distribution ) .",
    "we suggest that the size distribution evolves with the age or the distance from the star .",
    "the fading timescale ( @xmath161 days ) of the polarization is fairly rapid compared with the recovering rate of brightness from deep declines .",
    "it can not be interpreted by a simple dissipation due to radial expansion of the dust puff at the expansion velocity of @xmath1 km s@xmath2 , even in the case where the dust formation occurred at @xmath162 . higher expansion velocity or some mechanism to destroy the dust grains should be needed .",
    "so far we have not detected a possible increasing part of the transient polarization , which would be important to discuss the process and the site of the dust formation around rcb stars .",
    "further spectropolarimetric monitoring of rcb stars near maximum brightness will bring a valuable information of a dust formation and destruction processes in a hostile circumstellar environment .",

    "monte carlo method is a useful tool to solve problems including multiple scattering of light since it requires only a few assumptions and it can be applied for many kinds of complicated geometries and particles .",
    "the details in application of monte carlo method for light scattering process is described in , e.g. , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig9 ] , we consider the cartesian coordinate , ( x , y , z ) .",
    "we define that the origin is the center of the star .",
    "the stellar radius is 1 , i.e. , the coordinate is normalized by the stellar radius .",
    "the direction of the earth is @xmath163@xmath164 .",
    "the shape of the dust puff is a part of geometrically - thin spherical shell with a radius of @xmath108 and an opening angle of @xmath21 from the origin .",
    "the center of the dust puff , @xmath108 , is located in the @xmath165-@xmath166 plane .",
    "these enable us to investigate the depolarization effect due to finite solid angle of the photosphere in the neighborhood of the star , which is a different point from @xcite s",
    ". optical depth of the cloud along @xmath108 is @xmath167 . for simplicity , we neglect geometrical thickness of the shell .",
    "the scattering angle , that is , the angle between @xmath108 and @xmath163 , is @xmath85 .    in our monte carlo simulation , more than a million photons",
    "are emitted from random sites on the stellar surface toward random directions .",
    "all released photons have the same intensity , which means that rim darkening effect is neglected .",
    "when they meet the cloud , some penetrate , some are absorbed by , and the others are scattered by dust grains in the cloud .",
    "the scattered photons are partially polarized and emitted again toward a new direction according to a phase function @xmath168@xmath169 .",
    "we adopt a single peaked henyey - greenstein function @xcite as the phase function : @xmath170 and , @xmath171),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath172 is an asymmetric parameter ( ranging from 0 for isotropic scattering to 1 for forward - throwing ) , @xmath173 and @xmath119 are the maximum linear and circular polarization , respectively , and @xmath174 is the skew factor ( @xmath175 in almost all cases ) .",
    "three parameters @xmath85 , @xmath172 , and @xmath173 , are related with the linear polarization .",
    "@xmath172 varies with a wavelength and a mean size of dust .",
    "@xcite investigated the dependency of @xmath172 on wavelength for a well - known model of interstellar graphite dust .",
    "we used his values , lacking a better alternative for a mixture of cosmic grains having various sizes . referring to figure 2 of his paper",
    ", we adopt @xmath176 at 5500  .",
    "we also obtain the albedo @xmath177 at 5500   from the same figure .",
    "the @xmath173 is set to 0.51 @xcite .",
    "although the single peaked henyey - greenstein phase function is not well approximated at longer wavelength region and for back - scattering cases @xcite , the difference can be negligible in our cases , i.e. , @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "more details of our calculation will be described in a preparing paper @xcite .      in this section",
    ", we give a rough estimation for the size and mass of dust puff responsible for the amplitude of the transient polarization ( @xmath180% ) using the monte - carlo method . in table",
    "[ tbl-2 ] we summarized the results at 5500   for both @xmath181 and @xmath182 cases . since the wavelength dependence is expected to be small for the dust model , they can be considered as typical values in the optical region .",
    "it is obvious that the models of @xmath183 ( backward scattering ) can not produce @xmath184 , where @xmath185 is the scattering angle at the cloud center .",
    "figure [ fig10 ] shows the relations of @xmath167 vs. @xmath21 satisfying polarization of @xmath8% . to obtain the results of @xmath186 % , we need ( i ) @xmath187@xmath9 and @xmath188 for @xmath181 , or ( ii ) @xmath187 and @xmath189 for @xmath190 .",
    "the cloud at larger distance can produce @xmath191 % with smaller optical thickness and smaller opening angle because the depolarization effect due to finite solid angle of the photosphere become small .",
    "however , larger mass is needed for large @xmath108 .",
    "we can estimate the total mass of the dust puff as @xmath192 where @xmath193 is the bulk density of dust grains , @xmath194 and @xmath195 are the averaged cubic radius and averaged cross section of extinction per a dust particle , respectively , and @xmath196 is solid angle of the puff seen from the star . in equation [ eqn2 ]",
