    "investigation of the ultra - short high - intensity laser pulses propagation in air has been a hot topic in recent years due to its physical interest as well as its potential applications .",
    "it is very important to predict well how the electromagnetic field of the pulse evolves as it propagates  @xcite .",
    "although some analytical solutions with some approximations can be found  @xcite , in most applications the analytic approximations can not describe accurately the evolution of the pulses and we have to resort to numerical methods .",
    "split - step fourier methods  @xcite with the crank - nicholson scheme ( fcn ) in the transverse direction is often employed to numerical calculate the propagation of the ultra - short laser pulses via solving the nonlinear schr@xmath1dinger equation ( nlse)@xcite .",
