    "the study of deep - inelastic - scattering ( dis ) of polarised leptons off polarised nucleons provides information on the spin composition of the nucleon . the experimental cross section asymmetry is generally written in terms of the target nucleon polarised structure functions which have been successfully interpreted in terms of parton spin distributions . in this paper",
    "we analysed the available experimental data in terms of the virtual photon - nucleon polarised cross sections which describe the multi - hadron polarised electroproduction .",
    "this approach is complementary to the usual description of the interaction of the probing virtual photon with the constituent partons .",
    "it allows to extend the description of the process to the real photon case in which the interactions can be unambiguously interpreted in terms of cross sections only .",
    "the relevant quantity of our interest is the difference of the cross sections @xmath7 $ ] in which @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the photon - nucleon absorption cross section of total helicity 1/2 and 3/2 , respectively .",
    "a fundamental sum rule for this quantity has been derived by gerasimov , drell and hearn@xcite ( gdh ) .",
    "it relates the anomalous contribution @xmath10 to the magnetic moment of the nucleon ( @xmath11=1.79 , @xmath12=@xmath131.91 ) with the total absorption cross sections for circularly polarised real photons on polarised nucleons .",
    "it is given by :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the photon energy , @xmath16 is the pion photoproduction threshold and @xmath17 is the nucleon mass .",
    "the theoretical predictions for the integral are 204 @xmath18b , 233 @xmath18b and + 29 @xmath18b for the proton , neutron and proton - neutron difference ( p - n ) , respectively .",
    "experimentally this sum rule has never been tested directly because of the lack of suitable polarised targets and real photon beams .",
    "several experiments are planned at different facilities to measure the spin - dependent photo - production cross section in the nucleon resonance region and up to about 3 gev@xcite .",
    "multipole analysis of single pion photo - production amplitudes and estimates of the double pion contribution from the nucleon resonance decays provided an indication of the low energy contribution to the sum rule , which is expected to be the dominant one .",
    "these estimates were qualitatively consistent among each others providing results ranging between 289 and 257 @xmath18b , 189 and 169 @xmath18b , 130 and 68 @xmath18b for the proton , neutron and proton - neutron difference respectively[3 - 7 ] .",
    "all these findings strongly disagree with the gdh expectations and suggested a possible violation of the sum rule .",
    "in particular the multipole analysis of the isovector channel ( i.e. the proton - neutron difference ) provides an opposite sign of the sum rule expectation .",
    "the integral defined in eq .",

    "we analysed the available polarised deep inelastic scattering data to evaluate the contribution above the resonance region to the generalised gdh integral @xmath27 and to provide an estimate for the real photon limit .",
    "a regge inspired parameterisation was used .",
    "the regge theory provided a good description of the high - energy behaviour of the cross sections for a large number of processes@xcite . in this framework",
    "the cross section behaviours are given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the centre of mass square energy and @xmath31 is the intercept of the leading regge trajectory for the given process .",
    "the intercept @xmath32 is determined by the spin @xmath33 and mass @xmath34 of the exchanged particle and by the trajectory slope @xmath35 0.8 - 0.9 gev@xmath36 . in the case of the absorption of circularly polarised photons on polarised nucleon",
    "it is useful to consider the isovector and the isoscalar terms of the interaction@xcite .",
    "the isovector contribution to @xmath37 is described by the @xmath38 meson trajectory : @xmath39 .",
    "the axial vector meson @xmath40 is still now an elusive prey in most of experiments due to its large width and the presence of strong background .",
    "experiments of the last twenty years provided contradictory measurements of the @xmath40 meson mass and width over the wide ranges 1.05 - 1.28 gev and 0.24 - 0.61 gev , respectively@xcite .",
    "the expected value of the @xmath40 meson intercept is about @xmath130.3 , but due to the uncertainties in the knowledge of the mass and of the trajectory slope , a possible range between 0 and @xmath130.5 is generally considered .    the isoscalar contribution to @xmath37",
    "is described by the @xmath41 meson trajectory @xmath42 .",
    "being the @xmath43 meson mass well known , its intercept is expected to be about @xmath44 .",
    "in addition it has been shown that the exchange of two non - perturbative gluons can provide an isoscalar contribution @xmath45 where the mass parameter @xmath18 has the typical hadronic scale @xmath46 gev@xcite .    in this work",
    "we consider the above described contributions for the case of photo - absorption of circularly polarised virtual photon on polarised nucleon where the centre of mass square energy is given by @xmath47 .",
    "we have analysed the data from deep inelastic scattering of longitudinally polarised leptons off polarised @xmath1h , @xmath3h and @xmath2he targets which provided measurements of the photo - absorption asymmetry @xmath48 for the proton , deuteron and neutron respectively .",
    "the measurements were performed by six experiments at cern ( emc@xcite , smc@xcite ) , slac ( e142@xcite , e143@xcite , e154@xcite ) and desy ( hermes@xcite ) . for each experiment we considered the data set with the most detailed @xmath6 and @xmath24 binnings .",
    "therefore we did not include in the fit the @xmath6-averaged data which are generally used for the determination of the polarised structure function @xmath23 .",

    "the structure function @xmath53 was calculated from published parameterisations of the unpolarised structure functions @xmath54 @xcite for the proton , neutron and deuteron and of @xmath55 , the ratio of the absorption cross sections @xcite for longitudinally and transversely polarised virtual photons .",
    "the structure function r was assumed to be independent of the target ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the @xmath37 experimental data were reproduced by a global 3-d fit over the @xmath6 and @xmath57 variables and the isospin dimension @xmath58 :    @xmath59   ^{}f,\\ ] ]    where @xmath60 is the threshold factor    @xmath61^p,\\ ] ]    where @xmath62 gev is the single pion electro - production threshold and @xmath63 gev is a common mass scale of the exchanged particles which is close to the @xmath40 and @xmath43 meson masses and to the two gluon exchange hadronic scale .",

    "@xmath60 increases from 0 at the pion electro - production threshold to @xmath68 at high @xmath57 , when @xmath69 .    because regge theory gives no indication about the relative weight and @xmath6-dependence of the various contributions , the three coefficients in eq .",

    "the stronger experimental variation of @xmath100 at low-@xmath24 respect to @xmath101 is simply explained by the similar low-@xmath24 behaviors of the isovector and the isoscalar components in the neutron .",
    "the change of sign of @xmath102 is at @xmath103 and is due to the different @xmath24-dependence of the two isoscalar components , being the @xmath43-meson positive contribution dominating at large-@xmath24 , while the two - gluons negative one at low-@xmath24 .",

    "the evaluations of the low - energy parts @xmath120 are also presented .",
    "the latter results are more model dependent respect to the high - energy contributions and are strongly affected by the choice of the threshold factor @xmath60 . moreover @xmath120 is less constrained by the experimental data and therefore provides only an approximate estimate of the multi - hadron and non - resonant photo - production contribution at low energy .    in table 2",
    "the @xmath115 and @xmath120 contributions , averaged over the three models , are reported .",
    "the quoted errors for the integrals were derived considering both the contribution of the free parameter errors and the contribution of the fit parameterisation .",
    "the latter , which is the dominant one for the real photon extrapolation , has been evaluated from the slightly different predictions of the three models , from varying the fixed parameters of the fit ( @xmath73 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) within a factor two around the chosen values and from a @xmath6-independent choice of the power expression of the threshold function @xmath60 .    in table 2",
    "we also reported the contributions from the most recent analysis of single - pion photo - production in both resonant and non - resonant channels @xcite and from the decay of the nucleon resonances in two - pions @xcite . as it is seen the discrepancies between the sum of these two latter contributions and the gdh sum rule expectation",
    "is reduced by a factor @xmath123 2 if we add our results for the high - energy contributions .",
    "moreover the above discrepancies are almost canceled if we also include our estimates for the low - energy region .",
    "therefore the evaluation of multi - hadron photoproduction processes accounts for a relevant fraction of the gdh expectations for the proton and the neutron .",
    "in addition it represents the largest contribution for the isovector sum rule , in which the resonance contribution is mostly canceled .",
    "these phenomenological predictions will be soon tested by ongoing and upcoming experiments with real @xcite and virtual photons of low @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we have studied the deep inelastic scattering of longitudinally polarised leptons off polarised targets in terms of polarised cross sections .",
    "the cross sections have been fitted by three different parameterisations in which the isovector and the isoscalar contributions from regge inspired models have been considered .    with these parameterisations",
    "we were able to well describe , over the whole kinematic range of @xmath6 and @xmath57 , the experimental polarised cross sections @xmath124 and structure functions @xmath125 for the proton , neutron and deuteron and the relevant integrals .",
    "we were able to evaluate the @xmath6-evolution of the high energy contribution ( @xmath126 2 gev ) to the generalised gdh integral and to provide an accurate estimate for this contribution in the real photon limit .",
    "the latter contribution was found to be about one half of the present discrepancy between previous multipole analysis and the gdh sum rule expectations .",
    "moreover we also provided a rough estimate of the low energy ( @xmath127 2 gev ) multi - hadron and non - resonance contribution to the gdh integral .    at present , while waiting for direct and experimental verifications , from the informations coming from unpolarised single - pion photo - production data at low energy and from inclusive polarised electro - production data at high energy , it seems reasonable to conclude that no room is left for a large violation of the gdh sum rule .",
    "we would like to thank s.d .",
    "bass for many suggestions and for reading the paper and g.  pancheri and k.  oganesyan for useful discussions .",
