    "fluctuations and noise are inherent to the behavior of any physical system . their ubiquity and impact on technological applications have stimulated since long ago the study of their effects in different branches of science ( statistical physics , mathematics ) and technology ( communications engineering ) .    noise is usually perceived as a source of degradation of the properties of any system , leading to relatively small stochastic variations of a given magnitude around its deterministic ( noise free ) value .",
    "such a point of view is rooted on the study of systems close to equilibrium , whose dynamics can be linearized around the deterministic steady state",
    ". however , it does not hold in systems far from equilibrium , where nonlinear corrections to the dynamics must be taken into account . in these systems , noise may not only be the responsible for the observed behavior , but it may also make possible new states and behaviors that do not exist in the noise - free limit @xcite .",
    "examples of such behaviors are , for instance , the enhancement of the decay time of a metastable state ( noise enhanced stability ) @xcite , the synchronization with a weak periodic input signal ( stochastic resonance ) @xcite or the appearance of a periodic output ( coherence resonance ) @xcite . in systems with spatial degrees of freedom ,",
    "noise may lead for instance to the formation of convective structures ( noise - sustained structures ) @xcite .",
    "the effects of noise depend on whether it is additive or multiplicative .",
    "additive noise is present in all real , non isolated systems where the environment acts as a thermal bath .",
    "moreover , even in an isolated system all interaction processes exhibit some degree of stochastic fluctuations that lead to internal noise in the system .",
    "this effect may be further enhanced by adding noise to the control parameters of the system .",
    "in general , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem implies that noise in a nonlinear system may have both an additive and a multiplicative component .",
    "the effects of both kinds of noise in nonlinear systems have been thoroughly studied from the theoretical point of view @xcite , although experimental studies of the effects of multiplicative noise are more scarce . in particular , it has been shown that the characteristic signatures of either type of noise can be profoundly modified by the presence of even a weak component of the other kind @xcite .",
    "moreover it was also found that multiplicative ( parametric ) noise induces a shift in the critical mean value of the parameter that controls an instability @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze theoretically and experimentally the influence of multiplicative noise on the mode hopping dynamics of a bistable semiconductor laser . since the pumping current enters into the laser field equations in a nonlinear way , adding current noise may lead to multiplicative effects .",
    "we find that the residence times of each mode are strongly affected , and that increasing the noise added to the current is equivalent from the point of view of residence times to a lowering of the bias current .",
    "a theoretical model for the system under study is presented and analyzed , with the aim of understanding the observable consequences of the imposed fluctuations and the role of laser parameters .",
    "a better insight is obtained by simplification of this model to a bistable potential system .",
    "this allows us to discuss in detail the effects of current noise on the mode hopping dynamics .",
    "the results are in good agreement with the experimental observations carried out for a bulk edge - emitting semiconductor laser .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the rate equations for a two - mode semiconductor laser and we derive from them a reduced 1d langevin model that describes the hopping dynamics of the freely operating laser . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss in detail the reduced model and , in particular , the effect of external fluctuations of the injection current .",
    "the limit case of a slowly fluctuating current is analyzed as well and the results are compared with simulation of the rate equations . sec .",
    "iv is devoted to the presentation of the experimental results .",
    "we draw our conclusions in sec .  v.",
    "our starting point is a stochastic rate - equation model for a semiconductor laser that may operate in two modes .",
    "both modes interact with a single carrier density that provides the necessary gain .",
    "the two modes have very similar linear gains , provided that their wavelengths are almost equal and they are close to the gain peak . if @xmath0 denote the complex modal amplitudes , @xmath1 the carrier density and @xmath2 the injection current , the model can be written as @xmath3 e_+ + \\sqrt{2d_{sp } n}\\ , \\xi_+ \\label{rateq1 } \\\\ & \\dot e_- & = \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ ( 1 + i \\alpha ) g_- - 1 \\right ] e_- + \\sqrt{2d_{sp } n}\\ , \\xi_- \\label{rateq2 } \\\\ & \\dot n   & = \\gamma [ j(t ) - n - g_+ |e_+ |^2 - g_- |e_- |^2 ] \\label{rateq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the linewidth enhancement factor @xcite .",
    "the modal gains read @xmath5 defines the carrier density where the unsaturated modal gains are equal . the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 are respectively the self- and cross - saturation coefficients .",
    "the @xmath8 are two independent , complex white noise processes with zero mean ( @xmath9 ) and unit variance ( @xmath10 ) that model spontaneous emission .",
    "( [ rateq1]-[rateq3 ] ) have to be interpreted in it sense @xcite , thus the average power spontaneously emitted in each mode at any time is given by @xmath11 .    the deterministic version of eqs .",
    "( [ rateq1]-[rateq3 ] ) admits four different steady state solutions : the trivial solution @xmath12 , two single - mode solutions  @xmath13 and viceversa  and a solution where both modes are lasing , @xmath14 .",

    "this solution may coexist with the solution @xmath28 or even with the solution @xmath29 ( in this case , only for a small current range ) .",
    "finally , the solution @xmath30 prevails .      in order to better assess the effects of current noise on the modal dynamics",
    ", we next reduce the rate - equation description to a bistable 1d system . in the first place ,",

    "we also wish to remark that , although we worked in the it formalism , this form of the equations would be the same also in the stratonovich representations @xcite .",
    "the general expression just obtained for the dynamics is too involved to allow for a detailed analysis of the effects of noise . in order to simplify the theoretical analysis of this dynamical system",
    ", we further assume that : ( i ) the asymmetry of the modal gains is very small , i. e. , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ; ( ii ) the laser operates close to threshold , so that the saturation term is small , @xmath45 .",
    "in this limit , we find that , to lowest order in the small terms , the dynamics is governed by    @xmath46     + \\frac { 2 d_{sp } n } { r^2 \\tan 2\\phi } + \\sqrt { \\frac{2 d_{sp }",

    "thus @xmath35 is driven by the other two variables .",
    "moreover , the time - scale for the evolution of the relative phase @xmath35 is of second order in the small quantities , while that of @xmath47 and @xmath1 is of the first order .",
    "since we are mainly interested in time scales long enough for the relaxation oscillations of the total power and carrier density to be totally damped , and not in the transient dynamics , we can consider that @xmath47 and @xmath1 have reached the vicinity of their steady state . by neglecting the spontaneous emission term in ( [ rdot ] ) , we have that @xmath48 a more accurate approximation would be to solve the langevin equations for @xmath47 and @xmath1 and to insert the solution into the equation for @xmath35 in order to describe how the fluctuations of the former affect the dynamics of the latter . for simplicity",
    ", we disregard this issue under the assumption that the noise in ( [ rdot ] ) and ( [ ndot ] ) is so weak that they simply `` follow '' @xmath23 as prescribed by ( [ r0 ] ) . for a time - dependent current",
    "this approximation is valid only if @xmath23 does not change too fast .",
    "for example , in the case of an orstein  uhlenbeck process that will be considered below one must require the corresponding correlation time @xmath49 to be longer than the typical relaxation time of the total intensity .",
    "we shall see that this condition is generally met in our experimental setups .    in this representation",
    "the dynamics can be geometrically visualized as follows .",
    "the motion is constrained along a manifold ( approximated as portion of a circle of radius @xmath50 ) connecting the fixed points .",
    "radial fluctuations ( i.e. fluctuations in the total intensity output ) are completely neglected .",
    "the hopping dynamics is thus effectively one - dimensional and described by the `` phase '' variable @xmath35 , which determines how the total power is partitioned among the modes .",
    "altogether , the above calculation yields the reduced model @xmath51\\sin2\\phi \\,+\\ , { 2d_\\phi\\over \\tan 2\\phi }   + \\sqrt{2 d_\\phi}\\ , \\xi_\\phi \\label{phidot}\\ ] ] where we have defined the parameters @xmath52 and , for later convenience , we have introduced @xmath53 notice that the strength of fluctuations @xmath54 depends on the current . at this stage ,",
    "one may get rid of one of the three parameters . for example , one may rescale time @xmath55 so that the only independent parameters are @xmath56 and @xmath57 . however , since we wish to understand the role of the phenomenological parameters in relation with the physical quantities we stick to the form ( [ phidot ] ) .",
    "this choice is especially useful when current fluctuations will be taken into account .    to conclude this section , we point out that the same equation ( [ phidot ] ) has been derived by willemsen et al .",
    "@xcite to describe polarization switches in vertical cavity surface - emitting lasers ( vcsels ) .",
    "the starting point of their derivation is the san miguel - feng - moloney model  @xcite .",
    "we point out that the physical meaning of the variable @xmath35 is different from here as it represents the polarization angle of emitted light .",
    "thus the potential minima correspond to the two orthogonal linearly  polarized directions . also , nagler et al .",
    "@xcite have derived a one - dimensional langevin equation for the mode intensity in vcsel starting from a rate equation model for the field intensities in the two polarization directions .",
    "indeed , it can be shown that , upon the change of variable @xmath58 and redefinition of parameters , model ( [ phidot ] ) transforms into eq .",
    "( 19 ) and ( 23 ) of ref .",
    "this suggests that , upon a suitable reinterpretation of variables and parameters , many of the results presented henceforth may apply also to the dynamics of vcsels .",
    "in this section we analyze some features of the model in the case in which @xmath23 is a constant . in this case , ( [ phidot ] ) is a one - dimensional langevin equation with additive noise originating from spontaneous emission . the force in eq .",
    "( [ phidot ] ) can be derived from the potential @xmath59 the stationary distribution is thus straightforwardly computed as @xmath60 with @xmath61 being the normalization constant .",
    "notice that the potential depends explicitly on @xmath54 ( i.e. on @xmath62 ) through the repulsive logarithmic term in ( [ uphi ] ) .",
    "this term is usually very small for weak noise except at the extrema @xmath63 where it diverges logarithmically . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath64 vanishes linearly there .",
    "physically , this corresponds to the fact that , due to spontaneous emission , the modes are never completely switched off .",
    "the most important property that can be immediately drawn from the form of @xmath65 is that there exists a range of current values @xmath66 for which the system is bistable . within this region ,",
    "the system has three stationary solutions , @xmath67 ( stable ) and @xmath68 ( unstable ) . to compute them ,",
    "let us neglect the term proportional to @xmath54 in the definition of @xmath65 : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "the bistability domain is evaluated by the condition @xmath72 yielding the approximate expressions @xmath73 those last expressions have been checked to be a good approximation of the exact values computed from bifurcation analysis of the deterministic rate equations in the limit of small @xmath74 and @xmath41 .",
    "the effect of the term proportional to @xmath54 in ( [ uphi ] ) is to make the bistability domain dependent on the noise intensity , i.e. @xmath75 . by computing numerically the stationary points of @xmath76 we have found that the width of this interval of current values is reduced upon increasing @xmath54 with respect to the deterministic case .",
    "the current value @xmath23 controls the symmetry of the potential through the term proportional to @xmath77 . within the bistable region , at the critical value @xmath78 ,",
    "@xmath77 vanishes and the effective potential is symmetric under the transformation @xmath79 . in this situation",
    "the hopping between the two modes occurs at the same rate . for weak noise , @xmath80",
    ", we can easily estimate the two potential barriers as @xmath81 in the neighbourhood of the @xmath82 , i.e. for @xmath83 : @xmath84 actually , also the noise strength depends on @xmath23 : expanding to second order around @xmath78 the definition of @xmath54 , eq .",
    "( [ params ] ) , we get @xmath85 \\label{line}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , it turns out that this correction to the noise is pretty small for the parameters we choose .",
    "more precisely , one can estimate that , for a given change of @xmath23 , the relative change of @xmath86 is roughly a factor 10 larger than the one of @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "we thus neglect the correction terms in ( [ line ] ) and let @xmath87 .",
    "in other words , we assume that changing @xmath23 only affects the barriers through formula ( [ barris ] ) . with this simplification the corresponding residence times are given by @xcite @xmath88 \\label{tpm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath89 is the residence time at the symmetry point . notice that the prefactor depends on the noise strength to leading order .",
    "formula ( [ tpm ] ) enlightens the role of the asymmetry parameters in determining the residence times .",
    "indeed , it predicts that the residence times should depend exponentially on the injection current with different rates .",
    "in particular , we see that increasing @xmath23 around @xmath78 may lead to an increase of both @xmath90 if @xmath91 or to an increase of @xmath92 accompained by a decrease of @xmath93 if instead @xmath94 . to discriminate which of the two cases is of relevance one must thus know the values of the parameters for the laser at hand .",
    "this can only be accomplished by comparing with experimental data . for the laser at hand ( see below ) , the measurements indicate that the case of interest is @xmath94 .      before proceeding further , we check the accuracy of the reduction by comparing with simulations of the rate equations . for defineteness , we let @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 and perform different runs for different values of @xmath62 and for @xmath23 some 10% above threshold . with the above choice , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , meaning that the timescale for the slow variable @xmath35 is estimated to be about one order of magnitude larger than those of the fast ones .",
    "we also set @xmath102 since , as explained above , we expect that the phase dynamics should not matter .",
    "the largest part of the simulations were performed with euler method with time steps 0.01 - 0.02 . for comparison ,",
    "some checks with heun method @xcite have also been carried on . within the statistical accuracy ,",

    "we may focus on the case in which @xmath113 is a ornstein - uhlenbeck process with zero average @xmath114 and correlation time @xmath49 : @xmath115 that means @xmath116 this choice is suitable to model the finite - bandwith of the noise generator employed in the experimental setup . notice that @xmath49 and the variance of fluctuations @xmath117 can be fixed independentely .",
    "the effect of a time - dependent current is twofold .",
    "first , the potential becomes fluctuating : the @xmath118 , @xmath77 and @xmath54 coefficients become time - dependent quantities and the potential barriers @xmath119 change accordingly . for weak noise , and close to the symmetry point @xmath120",
    "they are computed from approximated formula ( [ barris ] ) with @xmath121 replaced by @xmath122 , @xmath123 the barriers height depends linearly on @xmath113 to leading order .",
    "obviously , this last expression makes sense only when the fluctuating term is sub - threshold i.e. whenever the system is bistable ( a large enough @xmath113 could always occur making the potential single - well ) .",
    "the second effect is on the additive noise strength .",
    "since @xmath54 depends on @xmath113 the amplitude of spontaneous emission is renormalized . indeed , since @xmath124 is @xmath125  correlated , the process @xmath126 can be replaced by @xmath127 where the average is over the fluctuations of the variable @xmath113 .",

    "therefore , in the following we can safely set @xmath131 .",
    "although expression ( [ fbar ] ) is sufficient to draw some conclusion than can be experimentally tested , it is useful to write down also the full langevin equation associated with the problem . putting al the terms together",

    "if this difference is large enough , current fluctuation will remove the degeneracy between the two stationary solutions .",
    "non - markovian equations of the form ( [ langmu ] ) have been thoroughly studied in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . although their full analytical solution for arbitrary @xmath49 is not generally feasible , several approximate results can be provided in some limits . in the following section we will discuss the case which is of experimental importance .",
    "altogether , the mode switching can be seen as an activated escape over fluctuating barriers given by ( [ fbar ] ) .",
    "the statistical properties of the latter process is controlled by the current fluctuations . to assess the nature of the stochastic process at hand",

    "an estimate of @xmath136 is the inverse of the curvature at @xmath68 that is approximatively given by @xmath138 .",

    "moreover , the frequency of the relaxation oscillations of the total power is typically above 1 ghz , and its damping occurs on a @xmath142 time scale , in accordance with the assumptions made in the theoretical analysis .",
    "at least to a first approximation , we can thus consider the limit of large @xmath49 .",
    "this justifies a further reduction of the problem to a kinetic description which amounts to neglect intrawell motion and reduce to a rate model describing the statistical transitions in terms of transition rates . if we consider @xmath49 as a time scale of the external driving we can follow the terminology of ref .",

    "we will now consider separately two limit cases .",
    "this corresponds to the situation in which spontaneous emission noise is very weak . in this case",
    "the residence time is basically the shortest escape time , which in turn correspond to the lowest value of the barrier ( the noise is approximatively constant in the current range considered henceforth ) .",
    "for the case of interest , @xmath144 we can use ( [ fbar ] ) to infer that the minimal values of @xmath86 should be attained for @xmath145 respectively .",

    "we can here treat current fluctuations in a parametric way .",
    "the switch time will be the average of escape times over the distribution of barrier fluctuations , i.e. @xmath152 . using again the approximation ( [ fbar ] ) , since the variable @xmath113 is gaussian , using the identity @xmath153 one gets @xcite @xmath154 .\\ ] ] this means that in this limit the residence times increase exponentially with the noise variance ( i.e. exponentially with the square of rms ) .",
    "in other words , the fluctuations always increase the effective barriers albeit asymmetrically .",

    "the laser is optically isolated from the rest of the set - up by means of an optical diode that avoid spurious back reflection .",

    "individual longitudinal mode detection is obtained by sending part of the laser output into a monochromator ( resolution @xmath165 ) with two independent output slits .",
    "the monochromator can be set in order to have at the two exits two different longitudinal modes emitted by the laser .",
    "each longitudinal mode intensity is then monitored by two apd detectors ( dc-1.5  ghz bandwidth ) placed beyond the slits .",

    "as described in @xcite , the optical spectra of the lasers tested show a single longitudinal mode emission for most of the parameter values ( @xmath23 , @xmath166 ) .",
    "however , there exist small regions in the parameter space where the lasers are bistable and exhibit mode - hopping between two longitudinal modes .",
    "a basic explanation of the destabilization of the leading longitudinal mode is that , fixing the @xmath166 and increasing @xmath23 the wavelength of the cavity resonance increases due to joule heating of the semiconductor medium .",
    "the gain curve peak shifts towards longer wavelength as well , but at a larger rate . eventually , the dominating longitudinal mode looses its stability in favour of a longer wavelength one , which has become more resonant with the gain peak .",

    "the anti - correlation of the two modal intensities is very strong ( better than @xmath167 in our case ) ; ( ii ) the distribution of residence times in a mode , defined as the interval between a switching - on and a switching - off event , is poissonian ; ( iii ) a sweep of the pump current across this parameters region , reveals the existence of an hysteresis cycle for the modal emission which is a signature of bistability between the two longitudinal modes .",
    "it is thus clear that these features are straightforwardly explained by the theoretical analysis presented above .",
    "the study of the fluctuations of the laser emission can be carried out by monitoring the modal intensities normalized to the total intensity output : @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
