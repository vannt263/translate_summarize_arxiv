    "the dynamics of particle - pair in lattice systems has received a lot of interest , due to the rapid development of experiment .",
    "ultra - cold atoms have turned out to be an ideal playground for testing few - particle fundamental physics since optical lattices provide clean realizations of a range of many - body hamiltonians .",
    "it stimulates many experimental @xcite  and theoretical investigations in strongly correlated systems , which mainly focus on the bound - pair formation @xcite , detection @xcite , dynamics @xcite , collision between single particle and pair @xcite , and bound - pair condensate @xcite .",
    "the essential physics of the proposed bound pair ( bp ) is that , the periodic potential suppresses the single particle tunneling across the barrier , a process that would lead to a decay of the pair .",
    "this situation can not be changed in general case when a weak linear potential is applied .",
    "then a bp acts as a single particle , sharing the single - particle dynamical features , such as bloch oscillation ( bo ) , bloch - zener oscillation ( bzo ) @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interaction can not only lead to distinct bo and bzo , but also induce the sudden death of the oscillations within a bloch period .",
    "we study the dynamics of bps in the extended hubbard model driven by a linear external field .",
    "it is shown that two interacting bosons or singlet fermions with nonzero on - site and nearest - neighbor interaction strengths can always form bps in the absence of the external field .",
    "there are two kinds of bp , which forms two bound bands .",
    "we find that the existence of the nearest - neighbor interaction can lead to the overlap between the scattering band of a single particle and the bound band , which can spoil the completeness of the bound band , referred as imperfect band . in the presence of the external field ,",
    "the dynamics of the bp in the perfect band exhibits perfect bo and bzo , while in the imperfect band  the oscillation presents a sudden death .",
    "the pair becomes uncorrelated after the sudden death of the oscillation and the correlation never come back .",
    "this behavior is of interest in both fundamental and application aspects .",
    "it can be utilized to control the unidirectional propagation of the bp wavepacket by imposing a single pulse , which is of great interest for applications in cold atom physics .",
    "numerical simulations are shown that this scheme achieves very high efficiency and wide spectral band .",
    "such a unidirectional filter for cold - atom pair may be realized in a shaking optical lattice in experiment .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_model ] ,",
    "we present the model hamiltonian , and the two - particle band structures . in section",
    "sec_bp dynamics , we investigate the bp dynamics in the presence of linear field .",
    "section [ sec_unidirectional propagation ] is devoted to the application of our finding , the realization of unidirectional propagation induced by a pulsed field .",
    "finally , we give a summary and discussion in section [ sec_summary ] .",
    "we consider an extended hubbard model describing interacting particles in the lowest bloch band of a one dimensional lattice driven by an external force , which can be employed to describe ultracold atoms or molecules with magnetic or electric dipole - dipole interactions in optical lattices .",
    "we focus on the dynamics of the bp states .",
    "the pair can be two identical bosons , or equivalently , spin-@xmath0 fermions in singlet state . for simplicity we will only consider bosonic systems , but",
    "it is straightforward to extend the conclusion to singlet fermionic pair .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian @xmath1where the second term describes the linear external field while @xmath2  is one - dimensional hamiltonian for the extended bose - hubbard model on a @xmath3-site lattice@xmath4where @xmath5 is the creation operator of the boson at the @xmath6th site , the tunneling strength , on - site and nn interactions between bosons are denoted by @xmath7 , @xmath8  and @xmath9 .",
    "let us start by analyzing in detail the two - boson problem in this model .",
    "as in refs .",
    "@xcite , a state in the two - particle hilbert space , can be expanded in the basis set @xmath10 , with@xmath11where @xmath12  is the vacuum state for the boson operator @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 denotes the momentum , and @xmath15 is the distance between the two particles . due to the translational symmetry of the present system",
    ", we have the following equivalent hamiltonian    @xmath16    in each invariant subspace indexed by @xmath14 . in its present form , @xmath17 are formally analogous to the tight - binding model describing a single - particle dynamics in a semi - infinite chain with the @xmath14-dependent hopping integral @xmath18 in thermodynamic limit @xmath19 . in this paper , we are interested in the bp states , which corresponds to the bound state solution of the single - particle schrdinger equation@xmath20for a given @xmath21 , the hamiltonian @xmath22 possesses one or two bound states , which are denoted as @xmath23  and @xmath24 , respectively . here",
    "the bethe - ansatz wavefunctions have the form@xmath25with @xmath26 .",
    "for such two bound states @xmath27 the schrodinger equation in eq .",
    "( [ s_eq ] ) admits@xmath28where @xmath29 and @xmath30  are respectively the reduced interaction strengthes .",
    "the corresponding bound - state energy of @xmath31 can be expressed as@xmath32the transition from bound to scattering states occurs at @xmath33 .",
    "then the boundary , at which the bound state @xmath27 disappears , is described by the hyperbolic function @xmath34which is plotted in fig .",
    "it shows that the boundary lines divide the @xmath35 plane into six regions , from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "the type of the bound states in each region can be foreseen from the extreme situations where @xmath38  @xmath39 .  under this condition , it is easy to check that there are two bound states  with the eigen energies @xmath40  in each invariant @xmath14-subspace .",
    "comparing eqs .",
    "( [ uv ] ) and ( bs_energy ) , we get the conclusion that there are two bound states in the regions @xmath36,@xmath41,@xmath42 , and @xmath43 : two @xmath24 in @xmath36 , one @xmath44 and @xmath45  in @xmath41 and @xmath43 , two @xmath46 in @xmath42 , while there is a bound state @xmath24 in @xmath47 and @xmath46  in @xmath37 , respectively .    on the other hand , we know that the scattering band of @xmath22  ranges from @xmath48 to @xmath49 , which reaches the widest bandwidth  at @xmath50 . therefore ,",
    "when we take @xmath51 , this diagram can characterize the bound - state number distribution @xmath52 : we have @xmath53 in the regions @xmath36,@xmath41,@xmath42 , and @xmath43 , where all the @xmath54 bound states indexed by @xmath14constitute a complete bp band .",
    "in contrast , we have @xmath55 in @xmath47 and @xmath37 , where all @xmath56 bound states indexed by survival @xmath14 , which does not cover all range of the momentum in the brillouin zone , from @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",
    "we refer to this property as incomplete bp band .",
    "therefore , the phase diagram also indicates the boundary @xmath59 , for the transition from the complete to incomplete bp bands , which agrees with the results reported in refs .",
    "@xcite . for given @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the complete spectrum of @xmath2 can be computed by diagonalizing the hamiltonian @xmath22 numerically . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , we plot the band structures for several typical cases , which are marked in fig .",
    "1 . we do not cover all the typical points in every region due to the following fact .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath2 obeys the relation @xmath60 in view of@xmath61where the transformation @xmath62 is defined as @xmath63 . * *  * * it is a rigorous result in the all range of the parameters . * *  * * as expected , we * *  * * observe that the two - particle spectrum comprises * *  * * three bloch bands , two bp bands formed by two kinds of bp states , and one scattering band formed by uncorrelated states .",
    "we can see from the fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , that two bound bands are separated from the scattering band whenever the system is in the regions ( points @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) @xmath36,@xmath68,@xmath42 , and @xmath43 . in contrast , whenever the points ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) lie in the regions  @xmath47 and @xmath37 , the pseudo gap between bp and scattering bands around @xmath50 vanishes , resulting the formation of incomplete band .",
    "what it quite unexpected and remarkable is that if we apply a linear field , the dynamics of the bp exhibits some peculiar behaviors , which will be investigated in the following section .",
    "before starting the investigation of the bp dynamics , we would like to study the relation between the center path of a wavepacket driven by the linear field and  dispersion of the hamiltonian @xmath2 .",
    "consider a general one - dimensional tight - binding system , which has the dispersion relation @xmath73 being an arbitrary smooth periodic function @xmath74 .",
    "the dynamics of wavepacket can be simply understood in terms of the semiclassical picture : a wavepacket centered around @xmath75 can be regarded as a classical particle with momentum @xmath75 @xcite . when the wavepacket is subjected to a homogeneous force of strength @xmath76",
    ", the acceleration theorem @xmath77 tells us @xmath78for constant field .",
    "the central position of the wavepacket is@xmath79   \\label{cp}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath80 is the group velocity .",
    "notice that the trajectory of a wavepacket is essentially identical with the dispersion relation for the field - free system  under the semi - classical approximation .",
    "this observation provides a fairly clear picture for the dynamics of a wavepacket in the presence of the linear field . as a simple example we consider a single - particle case for illustration .",
    "the single - particle bo with bloch frequency @xmath81 for @xmath82 can be simply understood from its cosusoidal dispersion relation @xmath83 rather than quadratic , in momentum @xmath14 .",
    "now , we switch gears to the case of two - particle .",
    "we note that the bandwidth of the bp band is comparable to that of scattering band , which leads to the conclusion that a bp wavepacket has distinct group velocity .",
    "it indicates that the dynamics of the bp state has the similar behavior with the single particle .",
    "the bo - like behavior of the bp wavepacket emerges in the presence of the linear external field .    in order to demonstrate these points , we consider an example for the hamiltonian @xmath82 in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) with @xmath8 , @xmath84 , @xmath7 . as",

    "@xmath91  is nothing but the tight - binding hamiltonian to describe a single particle subjected to a staggered linear potential , which has been well studied in previous literature @xcite . unlike the fractional bo @xcite in the case of @xmath92",
    ", @xmath91 can support wide bandwidth @xcite , which is responsible for the large amplitude oscillations .",
    "in the situation with @xmath93 , it turns out that particle undergoes bo with frequency @xmath94 . in the case of nonzero unbalance",
    "@xmath95 , it has been reported that the dynamics of the wavepacket shows a bzo ,  a coherent superposition of bloch oscillations and zener tunnelling between the sub - bands .",
    "the zener tunnelling takes place almost exclusively when the momentum of wavepacket reaches @xmath96 .",
    "then we get the conclusion that the bps serve as a composite particle , exhibiting bo and bzo in strong coupling region .",
    "in this paper we are interested in what happens if the initial state is placed in a incomplete band .",
    "it is presumable that the semi - classical theory still holds when the wavepacket is in the extent of the in incomplete band , because the nonzero pseudogap can protect the bp wavepacket from the scattering band .",
    "however , when the wavepacket reaches the band edge , the transition from bound to the scattering band occurs .",
    "the wavepacket diffuses into the continuous spectrum rather than the repetitive motion of acceleration and bragg reflection .",
    "we refer to this phenomenon as the sudden death of the bo . in the case of the incomplete bp band with a edge @xmath97 , the life time @xmath98  for an initial wavepacket with @xmath99  satisfies @xmath100when this occurs",
    ", the correlation between two particles breaks down and the wavepacket spreads out in space , irreversibly .    to verify and demonstrate the above analysis",
    ", numerical simulations are performed to investigate the dynamics behavior .",
    "we compute the time evolution of the wavepacket by diagonalizing the hamiltonian @xmath82 numerically . throughout this paper ,",
    "we investigate the dynamics of the initial gaussian wavepacket in the form    @xmath101 \\left\\vert \\psi _ { k}\\right\\rangle , \\label{psi_0}\\ ] ]    where @xmath102 is the normalization factor , @xmath103 and @xmath104 denote the central momentum and position of the initial wavepacket , respectively .",
    "the evolved state under the hamiltonian @xmath82 is @xmath105 = @xmath106 .",
    "we would like to stress that the initial wavepacket involves solely one bp band , either upper or lower one .",
    "however , the evolved state may involve two bp bands , even the scattering band ,  when the zener tunnelling occurs .",
    "we plot the probability profile of the wavepacket evolution in several typical cases in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the simulation is performed in the systems , where two bound bands are well separated from the scattering band . as the external field is turned on ,",
    "several dynamical behaviors occur : when two bound bands are well separated ( @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) , the bos in both bands are observed ( @xmath109 and @xmath110 ) . in the case",
    "( @xmath111 , @xmath112 ) , two bound bands are very close at @xmath113 , which induces the bzo as expected . for the three cases , the bo frequency doubles comparing with that of single particle case .",
    "case ( @xmath114 , @xmath115 )  fixes @xmath116 , two bound bands merg into a single bound band . as predicted above , simple  bo rather  than  bzo",
    "is  observed , with a period equal to that of single - particle bo .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the systems have a common feature : one of the bp bands is incomplete due to the pseudo gap vanishing . in the three cases ( @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) ,",
    "the bos remain in one band , whereas the bos break down at the edges of the incomplete band .",
    "for the case ( @xmath120 , @xmath121 ) with @xmath116 ,  two bound bands merg into a single incomplete band .",
    "the bp wavepackets in both two bands can not survive from the irreversible spreading .",
    "furthermore , the correlation between two particles is measured by the average distance of two particle @xmath122which can be used to characterize the feature of sudden death of bo for a evolved state @xmath123 . as comparison , the average distance @xmath124 as function of time for several typical cases",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and fig3 .",
    "we find that the sudden death of bo is always accompanied by the irreversible increasing of @xmath124 , which accords with our analytical predictions .",
    "finally , we also plot the bp dispersion relation @xmath125 and the central position @xmath126  of the wavepacket under the driving force together in one figure . for several typical cases , the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] indicate that the shape of the function @xmath127  coincides with that of the dispersion relation @xmath128 .",
    "we also find that the semi - classical analysis in eq .",
    "( [ cp ] ) is valid if @xmath129  is not too small .",
    "remarkably , one can see that such a relation still holds even for the incomplete bp band .",
    "these results are in agreement with the theoretical prediction based on the spectral structures .",
    "we now investigate the effect of the time - dependent driving force on the dynamics of a bp wavepacket .",
    "the acceleration theorem ( acceleration theorem ) tells us a pulsed field can shift the central momentum of the wavepacket in the case of complete band .",
    "however , it is easy to find that a pulsed field may destroy a bp wavepacket in the incomplete band , similarly referred as sudden death of uniform motion .",
    "the death and survival of a propagating wavepacket strongly depends on the difference between the initial central momentum and the edge of the incomplete band . of course",
    ", a survived wavepacket can retain its original motion state * *  * * by a subsequently compensating pulsed field .",
    "this gives rise to a scheme for destroying the pair wavepacket propagating in one direction , but remaining the one with the opposite direction .",
    "such kind of scheme can be carried out by two pulsed fields in a pair of adjacent intervals , which provides two opposite impulses to the wavepacket .    to illustrate the scheme , we propose two concrete examples .",
    "the first one is a square - wave pulse driving force in the form@xmath130according to the acceleration theorem , an initial wavepacket with momentum @xmath131  will acquire a momentum shift @xmath132 at instant @xmath133 if @xmath134  is within the band .",
    "the action of the subsequent force @xmath135 can return the group velocity to the initial value , continue its motion in the same direction .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath134  beyond the incomplete band , the bp wavepacket breaks down before @xmath136 and the subsequent force can not get the correlation back .",
    "therefore , for two bp wavepackets with opposite momenta @xmath137  or group velocities @xmath138 , one can always choose a proper @xmath139  to destroy one of them and maintain the other .",
    "this feature can be used to control the direction of wavepacket propagation  in demand .",
    "alternatively , one can also consider the sine - wave pulse driving force    @xmath140    to achieve the same effect from eq .",
    "( [ acceleration theorem ] ) . to examine how these schemes works in practice , we apply it to a wavepacket in the form of ( [ psi_0 ] ) .",
    "6 shows a numerical propagation of the gaussian wavepacket under the action of two kinds of pulse driving forces .",
    "it shows that wavepackets with opposite group velocities exhibit entirely different behaviors : one remains the original motion state , while the other spreads out in space .",
    "remarkably , the probability of the broken wavepacket is reflected by the pulsed field , which indicates that the unidirectional effect in the scheme works not only for the two - particle correlation but also for the probability flow .",
    "in addition , one can see a separation of slight portion from the moving wavepacket under the action of the square - wave pulsed field .",
    "the probability flow of two particles , no matter correlated or not , can be depicted by the center of mass ( com ) @xmath141where @xmath142 denotes the average for a evolved state . on the other hand , to characterize the efficiency of the schemes , we introduce the fidelity defined as@xmath143 ,   \\label{f(t ) } \\\\ f\\left ( t\\right )   & = & \\left\\vert \\left\\langle \\psi _ { t}\\left ( t\\right ) \\right\\vert \\left . \\psi",

    "here we have omitted a shift on the time scale comparing to the expression of @xmath146 .",
    "the computation is performed by using a uniform mesh in the time discretization for the time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath147 . as an example , in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we show the evolution of the com @xmath148and the fidelity @xmath149 for the same parameter values as the four processes simulated in fig .",
    "the plot in ( a ) shows the behavior of the two - particle transmission and reflection induced by the pulsed field , while in ( b ) the fidelities of the state transfer .",
    "it indicates that a sine - wave pulse has a higher fidelity ( @xmath150 ) than that of square - wave pulse ( @xmath151 ) . * *  * * these results clearly demonstrate the power of the mechanism proposed in this paper with the purpose to induce unidirectional propagation which is caused by a pulsed field .",
    "it is easy to estimate the spectral band of the unidirectional filter by neglecting the width of the wavepacket .",
    "we find that there are three reasons that trigger the death of a propagating wavepacket : ( i ) the central momentum of the initial wavepacket , ( ii ) the edge of the incomplete band , which is determined by the  values of @xmath152 and @xmath153 , ( iii ) the impulse of the single pulsed field .",
    "we consider the lattice with one bound band just touching the scattering band at the center momentum @xmath50 .",
    "we note , but do not prove exactly , that the dispersion relation in the left region @xmath154 $ ] and right region @xmath155 $ ] are monotone functions .",
    "then if we apply a pulsed field with impulse @xmath58 , a moving wavepacket with the momentum in the left region should be pushed into the scattering band and will not be recovered by the subsequent @xmath57 impulse .",
    "in contrast , a wavepacket in the right region still keep its initial situation after this process .",
    "therefore , roughly speaking , the proposed unidirectional filter works for the wavepacket with all possible group velocity .",
    "in this paper , the coherent dynamics of two correlated particles in one - dimensional extended hubbard model with on - site @xmath8 and nearest - neighbor site @xmath9 interactions , driven by a linear field has been theoretically investigated .",
    "the analysis shows that in the free - field case , there always exist bp states for any nonzero @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which may have the comparable bandwidth with that of single particle .",
    "it results in the onset of distinct bo and bzo for correlated pair in the presence of the external field .",
    "we found that the incompleteness of the bp band spoils the correlation of the pair and leads to the sudden death of the bo and bzo .  based on this mechanism ,",
    "we propose a scheme to control the unidirectional propagation of the bp wavepacket by imposing a single pulse . as a simple application of this scheme",
