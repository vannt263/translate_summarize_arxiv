    "production of heavy quarks is a fascinating tool to understand the nucleon structure as well as the underlying qcd parton dynamics .",
    "in addition production of @xmath0 quarks is a source of background for many searches for new physics at existing and future colliders .",
    "the high @xmath0 mass ( @xmath1 ) should provide a solid basis for a perturbative calculation .",
    "nevertheless , so far discrepancies between the experimental cross section measurements and the nlo qcd calculation have been found .",
    "the experimental procedure often relies on the measurement of the transverse momentum @xmath2 of the muon produced in the semi - leptonic decay with respect to the axis of the closest jet .",
    "this spectrum is harder for @xmath0 quarks than for @xmath3 quarks and , therefore , allows a statistical separation of the signal from the background .",
    "additional information such as lifetime measurements provided by silicon detectors can also be used .",
    "an alternative tag is given by the coincidence of @xmath4 mesons and muons which provide sensitivity to the region of low transverse @xmath0 quark momenta and is less affected by background .",
    "the recent experimental results obtained at the hera collider are reviewed in both the photoproduction ( @xmath5 gev@xmath6 ) and the deep inelastic scattering ( dis : @xmath7 gev@xmath6 ) kinematic regimes .",
    "when the exchanged photon has small virtuality ( @xmath8 ) the time - scale of the interaction is such that its hadronic structure can be revealed .",
    "photoproduction at hera can therefore be similar to the processes at hadron colliders and supplies complementary information .",
    "both zeus and h1 already published results on @xmath0 photoproduction @xcite .",
    "the zeus experiment has now measured the differential cross sections of beauty photoproduction using events with at least two jets and a muon in the final state @xcite .",
    "the luminosity used is almost three times larger than in the previous measurements .",
    "the fraction of events from @xmath0 decays has been extracted using the @xmath2 method .",
    "the kinematic region is defined by @xmath9 gev@xmath6 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 gev , @xmath12 , @xmath13 gev and @xmath14 .",
    "is the pseudorapidity , where @xmath15 is the polar angle measured with respect to the proton beam direction . ]",
    "figure [ fig : sigmavsetaphp ] shows a comparison between the measured differential cross section and a nlo qcd calculation for different regions of the muon pseudorapidity .",
    "the qcd prediction was calculated using the program fmnr @xcite .",
    "the hadronization is modeled by a peterson function and the spectrum of the semi - leptonic muon momentum was extracted from pythia @xcite .",
    "the bands around the nlo prediction show the results obtained by varying the @xmath0 quark mass as well as the renormalization and factorization scales .",
    "the measured cross sections are a factor 1.4 larger than the central nlo prediction but compatible with it within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "in addition , a dijet cross section ( @xmath16 ) has been determined using pythia to extrapolate to the unmeasured part of the muon kinematics and to correct for the branching ratio . for this measurement",
    "a different data sample has been used with looser cuts on the transverse momentum of the muon at large pseudorapidities .",
    "the result is @xmath17 pb while the nlo qcd prediction is @xmath18 pb , corresponding to a data excess of a factor of two .",
    "first results in the dis region have been already released by the h1 collaboration @xcite .",
    "thanks to the high luminosity in the new zeus measurement @xcite differential distributions have been measured for the first time in dis .",
    "events were selected by requiring the presence of at least one muon in the final state and at least one jet in the breit frame , where @xmath19 is the momentum of the exchanged photon , @xmath20 is th bjorken scaling variable and @xmath21 is the proton momentum , a purely space - like photon and a proton collide head - on . ] .",
    "a total visible cross section of @xmath22 pb was measured for the reaction @xmath23 in the kinematic region defined by : @xmath24 gev@xmath6 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 gev , @xmath27 and one jet in the breit frame with @xmath28 gev and @xmath29 . also for this measurement the @xmath2 method was applied .",
    "this result has been compared with a nlo qcd calculation implemented in the hvqdis program @xcite , after folding the @xmath0 quark momentum spectrum with a peterson fragmentation function and subsequently with a spectrum of the semi - leptonic muon momentum extracted from rapgap @xcite .",
    "the nlo qcd prediction is @xmath30 pb which agrees with the measured value within the errors . the differential cross section as a function of @xmath8 compared to the nlo calculation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmavsq2dis ] .",
    "the prediction of the monte carlo program cascade @xcite , which implements a calculation based on the ccfm evolution equations @xcite and uses a @xmath31-dependent gluon density , is 35 pb which is in very good agreement with the measurement .",
    "in addition , the simulation gives a good description of the measured differential cross sections .",
    "the separation of charm and beauty contributions to the signal can also be performed by exploiting the charge and angle correlations of the @xmath4 meson and of the muon in the reaction @xmath33 .",
    "of particular interest is the configuration in which the muon and the @xmath4 originate from the same parent @xmath34-meson yielding unlike charge sign @xmath32 pairs produced in the same hemisphere .    using this strategy and performing a likelihood fit on the kinematic distributions",
    "h1 has extracted the cross sections of beauty and charm production in the kinematic region defined by @xmath35 gev , @xmath36 , @xmath37 gev , @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the measured values , which confirm previous results , are respectively @xmath40 pb and @xmath41 pb which are well above lo+parton shower monte carlo expectations .",
    "a similar analysis has been conducted by zeus @xcite whose selection has been optimized for decays of @xmath0 quarks . the beauty cross section , measured in a slighty different phase space ( @xmath42 gev , @xmath36 , @xmath43 gev , @xmath44 ) , is @xmath45 pb .",
    "the result is in good agreement with the the h1 measurement once the same cuts are applied . in order to compare the measured cross section with nlo qcd predictions",
    "a photoproduction - enriched sample has been selected by applying the cuts @xmath9 gev@xmath6 and @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , the measurement is restricted in a @xmath0 quark rapidity range @xmath47 where the distributions of the monte carlo program used to extrapolate agree with the respective fmnr spectra within @xmath48 .",
    "the result for the extrapolated cross section is @xmath49 nb while the nlo prediction of fmnr for this reaction is only @xmath50 nb .",
    "the understanding of the @xmath0 quark production mechanism is an outstanding puzzle in qcd .",
    "a set of new visible cross sections of beauty production , defined close to the detector acceptance , have been measured at hera .",
    "the results are about a factor 1.4 higher than the nlo qcd predictions but consistent within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties both in the photoproduction and the dis regions .",
    "an excess of measured cross sections over the nlo qcd prediction is observed when attempts are made to extrapolate cross sections to regions which are not directly measured by the detectors .",
    "the hera collider is now starting a new phase of operation at higher luminosities . together with the enhanced @xmath0-tagging capabilities of the new h1 and zeus vertex detector and tracking triggers",
    "more precise and differential measurements can be expected within the next five years .",
