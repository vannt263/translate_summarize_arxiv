    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) have been used as standard distance indicators and have become a powerful tool for studying the expansion of the universe , since they exhibit similar maximum brightness and uniform light curves .",
    "they are used to constrain the cosmological parameters and provide the evidence for the existence of dark energy ( schmidt et al .",
    "1998;perlmutter et al . 1999",
    "; knop et al . 2003 ; astier et al .",
    "2006 ; riess et al . 2006 ) .    despite of their importance in the cosmological studies , the progenitor system of sne",
    "ia has not been fully understood yet and is still debated ( branch et al .",
    "there are two models for the progenitor system , which are the double degenerate model ( dd ) and the single degenerate model ( sd ) .",
    "the dd scenario assumes that merging of double c+o white dwarfs with the combined mass exceeding the chandrasekhar mass limit , which is about 1.4 @xmath1 , results in sn ia explosion ( e.g. , iben & tutukov 1984 ; webbink 1984 ) .",
    "however , the dd has been suggested to lead to an accretion - induced collapse rather than a sn ia ( e.g. , nomoto & iben 1985 ; saio & nomoto 1985 ) . on the other hand , in the sd scenario ,",
    "a white dwarf accretes the gas from the companion non - degenerate star in a binary system and increases its mass up to the chandrasekhar limit to explode as a sn ( e.g. , nomoto et al .",
    "1997 ; han & podsiadlowski 2004 ) .",
    "hachisu , kato , & nomoto ( 1996 ) proposed a new plausible progenitor system based on the optically thick wind theory of mass - accreting white dwarfs . in this model , the accretion to the white dwarf at a rate exceeding the rate of hydrogen burning near the surface",
    "is inhibited by blowing a strong wind . in this way",
    ", the wind avoids the formation of a common envelope and the white dwarf can increase its mass up to the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "they suggested two main evolutionary paths to sne ia , depending on the evolutionary stage of the companion star : a helium - rich supersoft x - ray source channel ( hachisu et al .",
    "1999a ) with the companion of a main sequence star and a wide symbiotic channel ( hachisu et al .",
    "1999b ) with a red giant .",
    "the above evolutionary scenarios for sne ia can be tested by observations .",
    "for example , a companion star should remain in the vicinity of the explosion site after the explosion of a sn ia in the sd scenario .",
    "if the companion star is identified by observations , the sd scenario will be supported .",
    "ruiz - lapuente et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ( hereafter ruiz04 ) reported results of their survey of the central region of snr tycho to search for the companion star .",
    "they measured velocities and distances of stars in the vicinity of the center of the snr and found a g2iv star moving at a velocity more than three times greater than the velocity dispersion of disk stars in that region . as a result , they claimed that this star was the companion star .",
    "( they called this star `` tycho(g ) '' . )",
    "this type of companion stars contradicts the evolutionary paths proposed by hachisu et al .",
    "( 1999a , b ) and seems to suggest an alternative evolutionary path to a sn ia .",
    "fuhrmann ( 2005 ) has argued that tycho(g ) might be a thick - disc star which is coincidentally passing the vicinity of the supernova remnant , though the probability is extremely low .",
    "therefore , the physical association of tycho(g ) with the snr needs to be confirmed by other methods . to this end",
    ", we performed photometric and spectroscopic observations of stars including tycho(g ) with subaru telescope and present our results in this paper .",
    "ozaki & shigeyama ( 2006 ) ( hereafter os06 ) proposed an alternative method to investigate the association of a star with the sn ejecta .",
    "when a star is in the vicinity of the center of the expanding ejecta , photons emitted from the star toward the observer are absorbed only by the ejecta moving toward the observer .",
    "hence the absorption lines exhibit broad wings present only in the blue - shifted side , while a background star exhibits very broad wings in both of the blue and red sides of the absorption lines .",
    "the possibility that another irrelevant star happens to be inside the ejecta of snr tycho is only 0.1 % as estimated from the density of stars there .",
    "therefore a star inside snr tycho is very likely to be the companion star of tycho s sn . in snr tycho",
    ", atoms are expected to be in the ground states .",
    "thus useful absorption lines in the optical wavelength range can be formed by fe i at 3720 @xmath2 and 3860  .",
    "tycho s supernova ( sn 1572 ) is one of the type ia supernovae in our galaxy .",
    "the distance to snr tycho is @xmath3 kpc , derived from its x - ray spectrum ( fink et al . 1994 ) . from the x - ray imaging observations with chandra , the center of the remnant is determined to be ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) = ( , ) ( j2000.0 ) to minimize the ellipticity of the blast wave of the snr ( warren et al . 2005 ) .",
    "they also estimated the diameter of snr tycho as 8. snr tycho is one of a few well - studied young remnants with known age and the remnant is so young that it could retain enough amount of fe i to form absorption lines in the spectrum of the companion star .    in  2 , we report two kinds of observations , imaging and spectroscopy . in  2.1 , we describe results of imaging observations and explain how we determine the region to search the companion star . in  2.2 , we describe results of spectroscopic observations and data reduction . in  3 ,",
    "we explain the method to estimate the amount of absorption lines of fe i in terms of equivalent widths . in  4 , we summarize the results of our observations .",
    "finally , we discuss the detected absorption lines and the possibility of identification of the companion star of tycho s sn in  5 .",
    "stars in the region of snr tycho was observed with suprime - cam ( miyazaki et al .",

    "we determine spectral types by finding a template spectrum that most closely matches the observed spectrum of each star in the wavelength range of 3900 - 4400  .",
    "we have chosen this wavelength range because fe i absorption lines due to snr are expected at wavelengths shorter than 3900  , and also because the slit loss becomes large at around 4400  and increases at longer wavelengths .",
    "the resolution of our observing mode was not good enough to distinguish whether the star was a dwarf or a giant .",
    "in other words , spectra of a dwarf and a giant are similar in low resolution .",
    "thus we used only dwarf spectra for spectral fitting .",
    "this is sufficient for our aim to find possible absorption features of the snr in observed spectra .",
    "we first compare the observed spectra with some templates to see global line shapes at 3900 - 4400  .",
    "then we have chosen several template spectra by referring to the shapes of characteristic absorption lines such as the ca h&k lines at 3968  and 3933  , the h@xmath5 line at 4101  , the ch line at 4300  , and the h@xmath24 line at 4340  . finally , we calculate @xmath25 residuals of several candidate template spectra to determine the spectral types and the flux levels .",
    "to minimize possible errors in 3700 - 3900  for detection of the fe i absorptions , we determine the spectral type by choosing the template spectrum with the minimum @xmath25 residuals in the wavelength ranges of 3740 - 3840  and 3900 - 4100  . in this @xmath25",
    "fitting , the template spectra are binned to match the resolution to that of the observed spectra .",
    "the spectral types thus determined are listed in table 1 . in this",
    "fitting , we do not consider radial velocities of stars because they are negligible compared with our spectral resolution .      according to os06",
    ", the spectrum of the companion star of tycho s sn should show broad absorption lines of fe i in the blue sides of 3720  and 3860  .",
    "in addition , the same fe i in the ejecta should imprint broad absorption lines on both of the blue and red sides of 3720  and 3860  in the spectra of background stars of snr tycho .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] shows the predicted profiles of these absorption lines of the companion star based on the w7 model ( nomoto , thielemann , & yokoi 1984 ) for several densities @xmath26 of the ambient medium .",

    "as we relax the assumption in os06 that shock heated atoms are automatically ionized to some extent , more ionizing photons are emitted from atoms in lower ionization stages .",
    "as a result , for @xmath26=1.5 - 2.0 , which is higher than that calculated in os06 , the expected absorption line profiles become shallower and weaker than those in os06 .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure5.eps    we measure equivalent widths of possible absorption lines .",

    "since the accuracy of fitting around 3860  is rather poor , we also fit the observed spectrum with spectra of f7v and f9v stars in addition to f8v ( figure [ fig:6 ] ) to examine the influence of the adopted spectral type upon detections of broad absorption lines . as shown in figure [ fig:6 ] , the shapes of the three spectra at around 3860  differ from each other , while the shapes at around 3720  are similar .",
    "if tycho(e ) had a spectrum of a f7v star as its original spectrum , the eam in the blue side of 3860  would become large ( @xmath162.5  ) .",
    "however , the observed spectrum is fitted with f8v better than f7v .",
    "if we fitted with the middle type between f7v and f8v , we may detect some absorption at 3860  . because of a large variation of stellar spectra at around 3860  , it is difficult to quantitatively discuss the relatively weak absorption line at 3860  .",
    "ruiz04 classified this star as k2 - 3iii and estimated the distance greater than 20 kpc .",
    "this apparently contradicts our classification based on the spectrum observed in 3900 - 4400  .",
    "the spectrum of a catalogued star of k2iii ( or k3iii ) is quite different from that of f8v not only in this wavelength range but also at around 6500  that ruiz04 used to deduce the spectral type . as shown in the color - color diagram of the observed stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1a ] ) , the colors of tycho(e ) are @xmath40 and @xmath41 , similar to that of tycho(g ) . both of the stars are classified as f8v .",
    "the colors of tycho(c ) , which is classified as m1v , are @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "if a k2 - 3iii star is located at the distance of 20kpc , the colors of k2 - 3iii should be @xmath44 and @xmath45 because this star is affected by larger the galactic extinction than other stars which are located at the distance of 3kpc or less .",
    "as shown in the color - color diagram , stars are located on a sequence that has some scatter in the region with @xmath46 .",
    "tycho(e ) and tycho(g ) are located left on the sequence while the k2 - 3iii star should be located right on the sequence because a m1v star tycho(c ) is located just on the sequence .",
    "therefore , the classification of tycho(e ) by ruiz04 contradicts the colors of tycho(e ) .",
    "it is not at all impossible that tycho(e ) might have a quite peculiar spectrum if taking these results at face value .",

    "in fact , the overall spectra of these two stars are quite similar",
    ". the projected distance of tycho(ah ) from the geometrical center of snr tycho is @xmath162. thus if tycho(e ) is close to the sn site , then tycho(ah ) should have no physical interaction with the sn and vice versa .",
    "if tycho(ah ) is one of the background stars of the snr , the spectrum should have a broad absorption line in the red side of @xmath163720  in addition to the blue side .",
    "our observations indicate that this would not be the case .",
    "hence , the observed spectra of tycho(e ) and ( ah ) may indicate that they belong to a peculiar stellar type of f8v that has some deficit at around @xmath163720  compared with the f8v of ja84 .",
    "this deficit might be caused by metal richness of the star as the spectra of f8v stars with different metallicities in the catalogue of pickels ( 1998 ) shown in figure [ fig : f8v ] .",
    "we also compare with the f8v stars in the catalogue of bagnulo et al ( 2003 ) shown in figure [ fig : eso ] .",
    "a lot of metal absorption lines from 3720  to 3900  changing the shape of the spectrum in this region make it difficult to deduce the accurate eams of the blue wing of 3720  and 3860  absorption . to do this , we need to observe various nearby stars with the spectral type of f8v toward the direction of snr tycho and out of the region of snr tycho .",

    "the obtained eam distribution is consistent with a scatter due to measurement errors around eam @xmath160  ( figure [ fig:7]b and [ fig:8]b ) . on the other hand , there seem to be several stars which show positive eams of around 3  in addition to stars without showing finite eams ( figure [ fig:7]a and [ fig:8]a ) .",
    "( 80mm,50mm)figure28a.eps    ( 80mm,80mm)figure28b.eps    next , we discuss the profiles of absorption lines . the profile in the spectrum of tycho(e ) was discussed in  4 .",
    "if tycho(e ) is the companion star , then the other stars with broad absorption lines should be located in the background of snr tycho .",
    "these stars are expected to show broad absorption lines due to fe i in the ejecta both in the blue and red sides of the original wavelength 3720  .",
    "however , they exhibit very weak absorptions in the red side compared with that in the blue . in figure",
    "[ fig:9 ] , we show the eam distribution in the range 3720 - 3740  similar to figures [ fig:7 ] and [ fig:8 ] .",
    "there seem to be 4 stars having weak absorptions , but they are faint and the eams have large errors . in contrast , the other stars are distributed around 0  .",
    "there are 5 stars outside of the candidate region from which broad absorption lines are detected .",
    "tycho(ah ) has the best signal - to - noise ratio and is already discussed in  [ tychoh ] .",
    "tycho(aa ) exhibits a similar spectrum but with smaller signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "tycho(ad ) , ( ai ) , and ( ak ) seem to have broad absorption lines with larger eams in the red side of 3720  than tycho(ah ) .",
    "these eams of tycho(ad ) , ( ai ) , and ( ak ) are about a half of the eams of the corresponding blue side absorption lines . however ,",
    "large errors involved in these eams present us from deducing a clear conclusion .",
    "if positive eams are not caused by spectral features of peculiar stars , absorptions of fe i is the most probable interpretation .",
    "however , the observed absorptions are not exactly the same as predicted by the model of os06 .",
    "no red wings are significantly detected , while a significant blue wing is found for tycho(ah ) although its projected location is far from the center of snr .",
    "hence , if the origin of this absorption is fe i , refining os06 would be necessary .",
    "their model assumes spherical symmetry distribution of the ejected iron .",
    "but if distribution of neutral iron is clumpy , the fe i absorption might not be able to be detected according to a location of a star because of lack of the iron in the line of sight .",
    "also absorption profiles would be complicated .    finally , we discuss tycho(e ) as candidates of the companion star of tycho s sn . although there is no clear example which shows significant broad absorption lines both in blue and red sides of 3720  which are expected for the background of the snr",
    ", we confirm the blue - shifted broad absorption line at 3720  only for tycho(e ) in the candidate region .",
    "an absorption line with this unique shape can be formed by fe i in the sn ejecta when the star is inside snr tycho . if the supernova explosion occurred at the center of snr tycho defined by warren et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the projected distance of tycho(e ) is considerably short from the center of snr tycho ( @xmath1610 `` ) , while tycho(g ) is located away from the center of snr tycho ( @xmath1625  ) .",
    "ruiz04 suggested that the sn site was about 25 '' off the geometrical center of the snr .",
    "it is not clear whether this sn site is consistent with the observed shape of the snr in the context of hydrodynamical evolution of the blast wave in the ambient inhomogeneous medium .",
    "therefore , it is likely that tycho(e ) is another candidate for the companion star , considering the position from the center of snr tycho .",
    "we have performed photometric and spectroscopic observations to search for the companion star remaining in the remnant of a sn ia ( snr tycho ) .",
    "first , we selected candidate stars for the spectroscopic observations from photometric observations for the snr tycho region .",
    "then we obtained optical spectra of 4 stars in the candidate region and 13 other stars outside of the candidate region . to identify the companion star of tycho s sn , we compare the observed spectra in snr tycho with spectra of ja84 at 3720  , 3800  , and 3860  .",
    "if the position of a star is inside the ejecta of sne ia or in the background of the ejecta , absorption lines due to fe i in the expanding ejecta may be seen .",
    "we are able to detect significant broad absorption lines at 3720  for tycho(e ) and ( ah ) . as the distribution of eams at 3720  shows , spectra of tycho(aa ) , ( ad ) , ( ai ) and ( ak ) have possible absorption lines .",
    "tycho(e ) is located at the candidate region , while tycho(aa ) , ( ad ) , ( ah ) , ( ai ) and ( ak ) are located out of the region . however , we can not detect the absorption at 3860  at a sufficient significance level .",
    "it is difficult to detect them at 3860  because of uncertainty of template stellar spectra at 3860  .",
    "the detected absorption lines in the blue side at 3720  are consistent with fe i absorption of snr tycho .",
    "on the other hand , we do not obtain a clear broad absorption line in the red side of the original wavelength from a star in the background of the snr .",
