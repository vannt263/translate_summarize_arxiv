    "stars form from the gravitational collapse of dense cores within molecular cloud complexes . whether such clouds can sustain the production of stars for an extended period of time ( @xmath3  yr ) , longer than the typical free fall time ( @xmath4  yr ) is still unknown and critically debated ( e.g. maclow & klessen 2004 , tassis & mouschovias 2004 ) . empirical information on the duration comes from studies of the evolution of the gas in molecular cores ( the stellar progenitors ) and of the stellar population associated with young clusters and associations . as to young stars",
    ", the reconstruction of the history of stellar births can be obtained from the isochronal ages using the hr diagram .",
    "application to several nearby clusters and associations has shown a common behavior in which stars begin to form at modest levels roughly 10 myr in the past , and then at an accelerating rate with typical e - folding times of 13 myr . in the case of the onc",
    ", detailed studies of the optically visible population have revealed that the period of most active formation is confined to a few myr , and has recently ended with the dispersal of the remnant molecular gas from the winds and uv radiation of the massive trapezium stars ( hillenbrand 1997 , h97 ; palla & stahler 1999 , ps99 ; mench et al .",
    "2002 ; flaccomio et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "in addition to providing an average age of the onc , the pattern of stellar births has revealed another important aspect regarding its _ age spread _ : the existence of a small , but statistically significant population of older stars with estimated isochronal ages in excess of @xmath25  myr ( see also slesnick et al .",
    "since the existence of older stars in young clusters bears directly on the issue of the duration of star formation , the identification of such a population requires careful examination . in this letter , we present the initial results of a study aimed to determine the age spread of the onc using measurements of the lithium ( li ) abundance in stars of a selected mass range by means of the li  i  670.8 nm doublet .",
    "the li test rests on the ability of stars to deplete their initial li content during the early phases of pre  main - sequence ( pms ) contraction .",
    "it has been shown that the physics required to study the depletion history as a function of age has little uncertainty , since it depends mostly on effective temperature ( @xmath5 ) for fully convective objects ( bildsten et al .",
    "detailed numerical models show that stars in the range 0.50.2 m@xmath1 start to deplete li after about 510  myr , and completely destroy it after addtional @xmath210  myr ( e.g. , baraffe et al .",
    "1998 , siess et al .",
    "2000 ) . the first evidence for complete li - depletion in a pre  main - sequence ( pms ) star has been reported by song et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in the case of the hip  112312 binary system .",
    "similarly , the spectra of both components of the spectroscopic binary system st  34 , a candidate member of the taurus - auriga association , show no li absorption line ( white & hillenbrand 2005 ) . in both instances , the li depletion timescale inferred from stellar models results larger than the isochronal age .",
    "significant li depletion was also found in several t tauri stars at levels inconsistent with their relatively high luminosities , i.e. young ages ( magazz et al . 1992 , martn et al .",
    "1994 ) .    in spite of these sparse results ,",
    "the li test has never been tried systematically in young clusters in the assumption that subsolar members would have not had time to deplete significantly their initial li content . however , in the case of the onc the presence of a number of older stars in the hr diagram suggests that the opposite might be true . to verify this , we have selected a sample of 84 low - mass stars in the range @xmath20.41.0  m@xmath1 and isochronal ages greater than @xmath21  myr ( ps99 ) , drawn from the h97 survey with membership probability greater than 90% , based on various proper motion studies . their distribution in the hr diagram is shown in figure  1 , together with the region of partial ( light shading ) and full ( dark shading ) depletion predicted by stellar evolution models ( siess et al .",
    "the observations were carried out on 15 february 2004 as part of the ital - flames gto observing time  multiobject spectroscopy of galactic open clusters of different ages and metallicities \" using flames mounted on vlt - kueyen ( ut2 ) .",
    "the giraffe spectrograph and medusa fiber system were used in conjunction with the 316 lines / mm grating and order sorting filter 15 yielding a nominal resolving power r=19,300 and a spectral coverage from 660.7 to 696.5  nm that includes the li  i  670.8  nm line .",
    "we observed the same fiber configuration centered at ra(2000)=05h  35 m  16.0 m and dec(2000)=@xmath605d  24 m  20s in three separate 1 hr exposures . typical s / n ratios range between @xmath7 and @xmath8 per pixel for the brightest ( i@xmath213.5 ) and faintest ( i@xmath217 ) objects .",
    "data reduction was done using the giraffe bldrs pipeline , following the standard procedure and steps ( blecha & simond 2004 ) .",
    "sky subtraction was performed separately using the method employed by jeffries & oliveira ( 2005 ) .",
    "we obtained a good sky continuum subtraction , while the subtraction of the very strong emission lines due to the nebular emission in the onc was rather poor .",
    "however , this does not affect the measurement of the equivalent widths ( ew ) since all the lines used in this study are far enough in wavelength from sky emission .",
    "a sample of spectra in the vicinity of 671  nm are displayed in figure  2 for five stars of the same spectral type ( m1 ) , but different luminosity .",
    "notice the large variation of the li  670.8  nm line from star to star that , in some case , corresponds to a li abundance lower than the interstellar value , as we now show .",
    "our spectra are severely affected by spectral veiling , which needs to be corrected before determining li - abundances from the measured ew(li ) .",
    "given @xmath9 , the ratio of the excess to the photospheric continuum , the relationship between the true and measured ew is : ew@xmath10=ew@xmath11 . in order to estimate @xmath9 , we have measured the ew of three strong lines included in our spectral range ( ni  i  664.3  nm , fe  i 666.3  nm , and v  i  662.5  nm ) in all targets stars and compared them with those measured in the spectra of stars of similar temperature of ic  2391 and ic  2602 that are old enough ( 3050 myr , randich et al .",
    "2001 ) to ensure that their spectra are not affected by veiling . for each line and each star in onc ,",
    "the quantity @xmath9 was calculated from ew@xmath12/ew@xmath13 , where ew@xmath12 refers to the open clusters .",
    "finally , the average value of the veiling from the three lines was computed . in a few cases it was not possible to measure the ew of the three lines , and",
    "the veiling was derived using one or two lines only .",
    "measured li ews were then corrected for veiling using the @xmath9-values determined as above . corrected ( true ) ews are comprised in the range 400850  m .",
    "finally , lithium abundances were derived using moog ( sneden 1973 ) and kurucz ( 1993 ) model atmospheres , and assuming effective temperatures from the spectral types of h97 following hillenbrand & white ( 2004 ) .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath14  n(li ) ( @xmath15n(li)/n(h)+12 ) for the whole sample vary between 2.3 and 3.7 , without considering upper limits , with a median value n(li)=3.12 , very close to the lower limit of the initial interstellar value .",
    "random errors in li abundances include uncertainties in the correction for veiling , in the measurement of the ew , and in t@xmath16 .",
    "we estimate that in most cases the total error in @xmath14  n(li ) does not exceed 0.3  dex . in order to estimate errors in the abundance scale , in particular for the coolest stars , we have also determined abundances using the curves of growth of zapatero osorio et al .",
    "( 2002 ) which yield abundances systematically lower by @xmath20.15  dex .    considering the subsample of stars with mass in the interval @xmath20.61.0 m@xmath1",
    "( see fig .  1 ) , in all cases we do not find indication of li - depletion .",
    "actually , the median abundance ( n(li)=3.28 ) is slightly higher than that of the whole sample .",
    "the fact that the four stars with isochronal ages greater than 10 myr and mass between 0.7 and 0.8 m@xmath1 display no li depletion is not too surprising given the uncertainties introduced by the rapidly developing radiative core that make the analysis of li depletion very sensitive to the detailed physics adopted ( convective / radiative boundary and mixing ; e.g. piau & turck - chize 2002 ) .",
    "the situation improves for the subsample of stars with estimated mass below @xmath20.6 m@xmath1 .",
    "the derived li abundances are displayed in figure 3 where it can be seen that the younger onc stars have maintained all the initial li .",
    "the exception is the star # 73 for which we could only derive a lower limit since the poor s / n did not allow a determination of veiling . in the case of stars with isochronal ages @xmath173 myr , four of them show significantly depleted li - abundances ( up to a factor of 7 for star # 3087 ) , while the rest ( 8 objects ) fall within the region of no depletion .",
    "table  1 summarizes the properties of the depleted stars .",
    "we stress that these objects have 99% membership probability based on proper motion ( h97 ) , and the radial velocities derived by us ( listed in table  1 ) are consistent with that of the onc ( v@xmath18  26.5 km  s@xmath19 , e.g. sicilia - aguilar et al .",
    "2005 ) . given the significance of this finding , in the following we concentrate the analysis on this restricted group of stars .",
    "the existence of several li - poor , low - mass stars in the onc allows a direct comparison with both theoretical and analytical models of early nuclear burning . the mass and isochronal age for each star in table  1 ( labeled hrd )",
    "are determined using the pms models of ps99 .",
    "errors on both quantities have been estimated from the uncertainties on luminosity ( @xmath200.15 dex ) and @xmath5 ( @xmath2180  k , corresponding to half a spectral class ) .",
    "the same values ( to within few percent ) for the mass are obtained using the pms models of siess et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , while the ages differ by less than 10% ( larger values for siess et al . ) .",
    "similar agreement is also found using dantona & mazzitelli ( 1998 ) models , computed with a different treatment of convection . on the other hand , the models of baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) yield significantly higher mass , age and depletion levels .",
    "it is instructive to compare these results with the analytic estimates derived by bildsten et al .",
    "( 1997 ) that apply to the mass range considered here . for fully convective objects undergoing gravitational contraction at approximately constant effective temperature and assuming fast and complete mixing , bildsten et al .",
    "derive simple and accurate ( better than @xmath220% ) relations for the time variation of the luminosity ( their eq .",
    "4 ) and for the amount of li depletion at a given age ( their eq . 11 ) . from the observed @xmath22 and @xmath5 , one",
    "can then construct a plot of the mass - depletion time relation that is bounded by the determination of the li abundance .",
    "the results for the four depleted stars are shown in figure  4 . in the diagram ,",
    "the observed luminosity is represented by a line with positive slope , while the depletion time is set by the observed li abundance represented by a line with negative slope .",
    "the intersection of the two lines yields the combination of mass and age at the given @xmath5 .",
    "the last two columns of table  1 list the derived values obtained in this manner .",
    "the hatched region in each panel represents the allowed region bound by the uncertainties in @xmath22 and in n(li ) ( @xmath200.3 dex ) .",
    "stars # 3087 and 775 have almost identical values of @xmath5 and @xmath22 , and therefore occupy the same position in the plot . in both cases",
    ", we find excellent agreement between the observed and theoretical estimates : the stellar mass is well represented by the evolutionary tracks ( to within 10% ) , while the isochronal age differs from the depletion age by 10% . to our knowledge",
    ", this is the first time that the two methods give consistent results to such high accuracy .",
    "the agreement can be improved by considering that the age at a given depletion is quite sensitive to @xmath5 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "thus , a small variation of this quantity shifts the position of the hatched region .",
    "for example , using a hotter temperature scale ( by @xmath250 k ) , the resulting difference between the isochronal and depletion ages would be reduced to less than 5% , while the mass would maintain the same consistency .",
    "thus , our observations not only confirm that li can serve as a powerful and highly accurate age clock in young clusters , but also as a test of pms models .",
    "the situation for the two other stars displayed in figure  4 is not as favorable as in the previous case . in both stars",
    "# 674 and 335 , the derived n(li ) yield ages that are marginally inconsistent with the isochronal ones ( at the 1-@xmath24  level ) : these stars have experienced too little burning for the estimated ages",
    ". however , both objects are within the bounded region predicted by bildsten et al .",
    "a combination of cooler @xmath5 and/or higher @xmath22 would help in reducing the discrepancy , thus allowing the stars to fall within ( or very close to ) the hatched regions .",
    "we have already noticed that other stars that should have shown some level of li depletion actually do not pass the test ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . in particular , star # 114 has n(li)=3.18 although its luminosity and effective temperature are almost identical to those of # 775 and 3087 .",
    "less problematic is the case of star # 625 ( n(li)=3.17 ) with the same @xmath5 but higher luminosity ( log @xmath250.73 ) that places it right at the boundary of the depletion region ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 ) .",
    "of the two stars with log @xmath5=3.568 ( spectral type m0.5 ) , # 277 shows only marginal li depletion ( n(li)=2.96 ) despite an isochronal age of @xmath210 myr . finally , the only object with mass @xmath20.57 m@xmath1 that falls within the theoretical region of full depletion actually displays the initial amount of li .",
    "however , at this mass and age such an object has already developed a small radiative core , so again the negative result is not completely unexpected .",
    "the initial study of the li abundance in the onc has uncovered four low - mass , _ bona - fide _ members that show partial depletion at levels consistent with their age and mass .",
    "the derived ages of about 10 myr indicate that the onc does contain objects much older than the average age of the dominant population .",
    "the identification of such a group of stars has significant implications for the star formation history of the cluster , indicating that its duration extends long in the past , although at a reduced rate , in accordance with the empirical evidence found in the majority of nearby star forming regions ( palla & stahler 2000 ) .",
    "we note that the presence of a population in the onc with isochronal ages in excess of @xmath210 myr has been independently inferred by slesnick et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in their study of the very low - mass and brown dwarf members .",
    "however , this apparently old population could also represent a population of scattered light objects due to disk occultation whose true luminosity has been understimated . in our case , the consistency between the li and isochronal age for the li - depleted stars makes this intepretation unnecessary .    finally , we like to emphasize that it is important to extend the present observations to lower mass members of the onc where the transition between depleted and undepleted stars should occur .",
    "the study of h97 allows us to probe the critical mass interval between @xmath20.4 and @xmath20.2 m@xmath1 , while lower mass objects would be too faint for high spectral resolution observations in the optical .",
    "however , considering that a 0.3  m@xmath1 star is expected to deplete half of its initial li in more than 15 myr , it is possible that the observations presented here might have uncovered the most li depleted stars of the onc .",
