    "in @xcite and @xcite the authors proposed the concept of _ control communication complexity _ as a formal approach for studying a group of distributed agents exercising independent actions to achieve common goals . for distributed cooperative systems ,",
    "it is natural to expect that communication can help improve system performance , such as reducing the control cost . in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate how the concept of control communication complexity can lead to an inherent estimate of the value of communication bits in reducing the control cost .",
    "information - based control theory aims to deal with systems in which the interplay between control and communication are closely intertwined . for some early work see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we investigate information - based systems controlled by two distributed agents .",
    "in particular , we focus on cooperative control , the goal of which is for the agents , alice and bob , to induce a system output that depends jointly on the controls they independently select from their respective finite sets of control inputs .",
    "the problems treated below have extensions to settings in which the number of agents is larger than two , but such extensions are beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the concept of multiple distributed selections of control actions from a specified set of possible choices has not received much attention in the control literature until recent work by the authors . while we believe this perspective is novel , there are connections with earlier work on cooperative decision making such as in the team decision problems treated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it also makes contact with ( but differs from ) a substantial body of work that has been devoted to extending the concepts of centralized control to the treatment of distributed and multi - agent systems .",
    "space does not permit a complete survey , but relevant work includes @xcite where the exchange of information is modeled and then used to reduce a certain non - classical stochastic optimization problem to a classical one .",
    "the recent papers @xcite and @xcite address problems of distributed control with feedback loops closed through networks of communication - constrained data channels .",
    "the aims and fundamental problems encountered in our work on control communication complexity are substantially different . in what is reported below",
    ", the objective has been to extend ideas of communication complexity theory such that the cost of both communication and control is explicitly modeled and taken into account .",
    "the models being proposed are abstractions of a variety of physical processes arising in diverse applications such as controlled quantum spin systems and motion control of robotic vehicles .",
    "our goal is to understand the general principles underlying communication by means of the dynamics of such systems .",
    "while the distinction between our work below and previous work on decentralized control is real , the differences can be subtle as in the following example .",
    "suppose that two agents wish to find touring strategies in order to meet as quickly as possible , as exemplified by the scenario of a mother and her child separated in a crowded park .",
    "for that problem , a practical solution , not necessarily optimal , is to ask the child to stay in one place and for the mother to conduct a complete tour of the park . for a more complex situation ,",
    "consider alice and bob who jog in the same park at the same time every day . by tacit understanding",
    ", they wish their paths to cross or not to cross according to their moods ( the choices ) as prescribed in the following table     bob in good mood & paths cross & paths do not cross + bob in bad mood & paths do not cross & paths do not cross +    if alice and bob can call each other to communicate their choice of inputs , the problem is trivial to solve .",
    "however , if direct communication is not available or allowed , a basic question is whether it is possible for alice and bob to follow different tour paths based on their moods to accomplish the stated objective . moreover , if multiple feasible solutions exist , we are interested in identifying those that are optimal with regard to an appropriate metric , such as the total energy expended by the agents over a period of time encompassing many jogs in the park .    although table 1 bears resemblance to the payoff functions in classical game theory , one can not over - emphasize the point that there is no optimization of the table values in our problem formulation .",
    "a second example that is more closely aligned to the model studied here is the mobile sensor network positioning problem introduced in @xcite .",
    "consider a mobile sensor network , such as a network of remote sensing satellites .",
    "the sensor network serves two agents , alice and bob ; each of them wants to monitor a geographic region of interest selected from a pre - defined list .",
    "the agents do not communicate to each other directly ; in fact , they may not even know the identity of the other party .",
    "if for any given ordered pair of choices there is an optimal configuration for the sensors , it is natural to investigate whether one can design communication and control strategies , known as _ control protocols _",
    ", for the agents to jointly maneuver the mobile sensors to the optimal configuration based on their own individual control selections .",
    "moreover , if such feasible control protocols do exist , a second objective is to find the optimal protocols under appropriately defined performance measures .    to fix ideas for subsequent discussions ,",
    "there is assumed to be a control system with two input channels , one to be used by each of the two agents .",
    "the case of larger numbers of agents will be considered elsewhere . throughout the paper",
    "we index the finite collection of control inputs that alice can send to the system by a set of labels @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , a finite set @xmath1 is used to label the controls available to bob .",
    "it is assumed that over many enactments of the protocol the inputs used by alice and bob will appear to be randomly chosen samples from uniformly distributed random variables with sample spaces @xmath2 and @xmath3 . if one represents the target output when alice chooses @xmath4 and bob chooses @xmath5 by @xmath6 , then the @xmath7-by-@xmath8 matrix @xmath9\\ ] ] provides a compact representation of the set of target outputs for all possible choices of inputs and will be referred to as the _ target matrix_.    while the structure of control protocols will be explained in the following section , a basic observation is that the input labels of the agents , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are key inputs to these protocols .",
    "once @xmath12 and @xmath13 are specified , following the basic premise of @xcite , the control protocol is assumed to run to completion . for a control protocol , @xmath14 , let @xmath15 represent the state at time @xmath16",
    "when @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "if the system output mapping is represented by @xmath17 , the _ feasibility problem _ of _ protocol - realizing control _ is to determine whether it is possible to design a control protocol , @xmath14 , so that at the termination time , @xmath18 , the following condition is satisfied for all @xmath19 and @xmath20 : @xmath21    solutions to the feasibility problem may involve control protocols that require observations of the system state ; even though there is no direct communication links between the agents , it is possible for them to signal to one another via the dynamic system .",
    "an example of such a control protocol was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the number of bits exchanged during the execution of a control protocol is a useful indicator of its complexity . on the other hand ,",
    "control protocols can also be evaluated in terms of the control cost incurred , for example as measured by the control energy required .",
    "although communication complexity and control cost seem unrelated , we will demonstrate that there is a close relation between the two .    to make our results concrete",
    ", we will focus on a class of systems whose input - output mappings are bilinear .",
    "a prototypical example of such a system is the _ brockett - heisenberg system _ , which we hereafter refer to as the b - h system .",
    "the system is arises in sub - riemannian geometry ( @xcite ) , and it shares essential features with models arising in nonholonomic mechanics ( @xcite,@xcite ) and quantum mechanics ( @xcite ) . for b - h systems one can characterize exactly when protocol - realizing control problems have feasible solutions in the absence of any communication between the agents .",
    "moreover , when a problem is feasible it is possible to determine the minimal control cost needed to achieve it .",
    "on the other hand , in the case that the agents have partial information about each other s choice of inputs , it will sometimes be possible to decompose the control communication problem into simpler parts on each of which a smaller control cost can be calculated .",
    "the concept of @xmath22-signaling will be introduced , by means of which the agents may share partial information with each other .",
    "pursuing this idea , it will be possible to estimate the minimal control costs for two extreme scenarios , one without side communication or partial prior knowledge and the other with enough communication to allow the players to precisely compute intermediate results regarding the target matrix .",
    "the two extreme scenarios suggest a natural framework for appraising the inherent value of a communication bit in terms of control cost .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we provide a description of the basic model as well as the definition of key concepts . in section 3 ,",
    "background results on a bilinear input - output system are presented . in section 4",
    "we describe how to transform the optimization of a single round protocol into a matrix optimization problem , the solution to which is presented in section 5 .",
    "implications of the result for understanding the trade - off issue between communication complexity and control cost is explained in section 6 .",
    "multi - round protocols are discussed in section 7 .",
    "section 8 provides a brief conclusion of the paper .",
    "the dynamical systems considered here are inherently continuous time systems of the form :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is an arbitrary smooth vector field and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are scalar control functions that , once chosen , are applied over a time interval of standard length @xmath18 .",
    "the output @xmath27 is sampled at discrete time instants @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "information about the state is made available to the two agents through encoded observations @xmath31 and @xmath32 which are made at the same time instants .",
    "the fact there are standard intervals of time over which observations and selected control inputs are applied allows the analysis to make contact with prior work on information - based control of discrete - time systems . under our assumptions , we thus consider the following simplified version of the model introduced in @xcite . for @xmath33 ,",
    "let @xmath34 represent the fixed time when observations are taken .",
    "define @xmath35 observations of the state , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , are made available to each agent as encoded messages , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , consisting of finite bit - length codewords ; in other words , the ranges of these quantization functions are finite sets .",
    "computation and communication delays in reporting observations to the agents are assumed to be negligible .",
    "the agents select respective control actions , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 represents the set of coded observations @xmath43 ; @xmath44 is defined similarly .",
    "note that the arguments of @xmath45 and @xmath46 are defined on finite discrete sets .",
    "it is assumed that for each element in the corresponding argument set , @xmath45 identifies a unique element in a set of admissible lebesgue measurable control functions over @xmath47 ; similar assumption holds for @xmath46 .",
    "if one imposes a probability measure on the sets of choices , these controls may be interpreted in terms of the observation sigma algebras over the corresponding probability space .",
    "however , this probabilistic interpretation is not essential to the results presented in this paper .    for reasons of simplicity ,",
    "we assume that the controls @xmath25 and @xmath26 are scalar functions . the codewords identifying the selected controls are transmitted to the dynamic system .",
    "computation and communication delays associated with this step are also assumed to be negligible .",
    "thus at time @xmath34 the dynamic system can determine the control selected by alice and bob .",
    "the state transition ( [ eq : basic0 ] ) between times @xmath34 and @xmath48 is thus described by the following discrete time control model where the controls are square integrable scalar functions : @xmath49    the quantity @xmath50 is a global system output that is observable to alice , bob , and possibly to exogenous observers as well .",
    "the protocol parameters , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , are specified at time @xmath51 and remain unchanged while the protocol runs to completion .",
    "the case where these parameters are allowed to change over time is an interesting extension which is not considered here .    a control protocol , @xmath14 , consists of the functions :    @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "we define the epoch between time @xmath54 and @xmath48 as round @xmath55 . in round",
    "@xmath55 , an agent first observes and then selects a control to be applied to the system .",
    "the selected controls @xmath56 and @xmath57 will typically be time - varying in the epoch between time @xmath34 and @xmath48 , but they depend only on the encoded value of the state at time @xmath34 . hence , the agents use essentially open - loop controls during the round , but the selection of the control at the beginning of the round can depend on partial state information .    consider a dynamic system , ( [ eq : basic1 ] ) , with parameters defined by @xmath58 .",
    "a target matrix @xmath59 is said to be realizable at termination time @xmath60 if there exists a @xmath61-round protocol , such that @xmath62 and for any choice of indices @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the @xmath61-round protocol defined with @xmath65 and @xmath5 terminates with @xmath66    the initial state is assumed to be fixed and known to the agents .",
    "for the first round , there is no need for any communication to the agents .",
    "that is , we assume the quantization functions @xmath67 and @xmath68 always take the same value for all control choices and need not be transmitted .    because a target matrix may be realized by different protocols",
    ", there is an interest in identifying those that are optimal with respect to some performance measures .",
    "one such measure is to count the number of communication bits exchanged during the protocol execution . to make this precise",
    ", @xcite introduced the concept of _ control communication complexity _ by extending the concept of _ communication complexity _ that was introduced in computer science by yao @xcite . briefly speaking ,",
    "given a dynamic system and a target matrix , one defines the protocol complexity of a feasible protocol to be the maximum number of bits exchanged by the agents in running the protocol to completion .",
    "the control communication complexity is then the minimum protocol complexity over the set of all feasible protocols . a caveat : unlike classical communication complexity , control communication complexity is defined with regard to a fixed dynamical system . in the models considered in the present paper , control inputs are square integrable functions , and this suggests measuring the complexity of a protocol in terms of the integral of a quadratic function of the control .",
    "this makes contact with performance measures commonly used in centralized control .",
    "indeed , control communication complexity provides a rich new class of optimal control problems .",
    "while the relation between communication complexity and integral control cost may not be transparent , the analysis of the b - h system in @xcite demonstrates that there is an intriguing relation between them .",
    "intuition suggests that protocols in which there is limited communication between the agents _ except for their common observations of the system dynamics _ may require a larger integral control cost than those that employ a large number of communication bits in addition to the system observations .",
    "if the agents have partial information about each others choices of inputs , control laws can be more precisely tailored .",
    "a contribution of this paper is to take the first step towards analyzing this trade - off by comparing two limiting types of control protocols , namely , single round protocols which entail no communication bits , and protocols in which agents share partial information about which elements @xmath69 and @xmath70 are governing the execution of the protocol .",
    "we provide a fairly complete treatment of single round protocols , but multi - round protocols are less well understood at this point . as a lower bound on the control cost , we assume that it is possible for the agents to communicate their choices of inputs to each other without incurring any control cost or state change , thereby decomposing the original problem into a sequence of standard optimal control problems .",
    "the difference in the minimal control costs between this type of protocol and the single round protocols having no communication provides an upper bound on the saving afforded by the bits of information that are communicated between the two agents as described in @xcite .    in the current model",
    "the only unknown parameter to alice is bob s choice of control input and vice versa the only unknown parameter to bob is alice s choice of input .",
    "the single choice problem in which each agent has only one choice of control input is equivalent to the scenario where the agents have complete information on the system .",
    "since the initial state is known and there is no state noise , optimal distributed control can be devised without resorting to any state observations . in other words , for optimizing single choice problems , we only need to consider single round protocols .    for the rest of the paper we focus on scalar output functions to simplify the analysis .",
    "vector - valued outputs , as necessitated by the sensor network example , present a significantly larger technical challenge , and will not be discussed here .    to analyze the cost of letting our control system",
    "evolve under different input curves in single round protocols , we lift the evolution dynamics ( [ eq : basic1 ] ) back up to the continuous domain as described by equation ( [ eq : basic0 ] ) but with @xmath71 replaced by a scalar function .    unless stated otherwise , the controls @xmath25 and @xmath26 exercised by the agents are assumed to lie in a closed subspace @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath73 represent the tensor product hilbert space with inner product defined by @xmath74 at time @xmath18 , the input - output mapping of system ( [ eq : basic0 ] ) can be regarded as a functional from @xmath75 to @xmath76 , denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath17 of course depends on the initial state @xmath77 but as the state is assumed to be fixed and since for the time being we consider only single round protocols , this dependency can be hidden for simplification . without loss of generality",
    "we assume that @xmath29 and @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath17 is a bounded functional if there exists a finite @xmath79 so that for all @xmath80 , @xmath81    to realize a given target matrix @xmath59 , the optimal controls in general depend jointly on the parameters , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "however , if the agents make their choices independently and there is no communication between them , @xmath25 can only depend on alice s parameter @xmath12 and @xmath26 on bob s parameter @xmath13 .",
    "a target matrix @xmath59 is realized by a single round protocol @xmath14 if there exist sets of controls , @xmath82 and @xmath83 so that @xmath84 we emphasize that @xmath17 represents the system output at time @xmath18 .",
    "such a single round protocol solution may not always exist as we will see in subsequent sections .",
    "the problem may become feasible if alice and bob can exchange information about their choices to each other .    given the system ( [ eq : basic0 ] ) and the parameter sets @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the cost of a single round control protocol @xmath85 is defined as an average of the required control energy , given explicitly by the formula , @xmath86 one can also write equation ( [ eq : control cost ] ) in the form , @xmath87 which highlights the fact that the control cost is averaged over all possible event outcomes based on the control actions that are chosen by the agents .    in subsequent sections , we compute the minimum averaged control energy for an arbitrary target function @xmath88 .",
    "that is , our aim is to compute @xmath89 subject to the constraints that for @xmath90 and @xmath91 , @xmath92    before concluding this section we note that there are some similarities between the cooperative control communication protocols studied in this paper and more classical dynamic game strategies as studied in , say , @xcite .",
    "yet there are fundamental differences ; for example , optimization of payoff functions is not the focus of our investigation . using the rendezvous problem as an example ,",
    "once the moods of the the agents are fixed , the outcome to be achieved is automatically defined by the target matrix .",
    "the investigation focus is on how to ensure that the target objective ",
    "paths crossing or not crossing  can be guaranteed .",
    "the work here also has some connection with the many papers in the literature dealing with distributed control of mobile agents , multi - agent consensus problems , and classical team decision theory .",
    "see , for instance , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , and @xcite . in these papers",
    "the dynamics of the subsystems controlled by the agents are usually not tightly coupled and the control cost is not explicitly calculated , unlike the models we are considering here . moreover , allowing agents to select controls from sets of standard inputs is also a fundamental point of departure .",
    "the simplest system defined in section 2 is probably of the following linear type : @xmath93 the input - output mapping of this system is affine in @xmath94 .",
    "moreover , it is easy to check that if @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 for some @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath46 , and @xmath101 , then @xmath102 thus , there are severe restrictions on the set of realizable target functions for such an input - output mapping . a class of distributed control systems that realizes a richer class of input - output mappings has two independent input channels entering the system in a jointly bilinear fashion .",
    "more precisely , we have the following definition :    consider a system defined by equation ( [ eq : basic0 ] ) with control functions defined in @xmath103 , a closed subset of @xmath104 $ ] .",
    "the system is a _ bilinear input - output system _ if for any time @xmath105 , the output at @xmath16 , regarded as a mapping @xmath106 from @xmath75 to @xmath76 is bilinear in the control function ordered pair @xmath107 .    in state - space representation ,",
    "two prototypical classes come to mind .",
    "the first class is :    @xmath108    for some matrix @xmath109 and vectors @xmath110 and @xmath71 .",
    "a second , in a way more important class , comes from the brockett - heisenberg ( b - h ) system and their generalization , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the b - h system , denoted by @xmath111 , can be described as follows .",
    "@xmath112    the fact that the input - output mappings of these systems are bilinear in @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be easily verified . note that in both cases we could take @xmath103 to be @xmath104 $ ] which results in a bilinear input - output function with an infinite dimensional matrix representation . on the other hand",
    ", we could also restrict @xmath103 to some finite dimensional subspace of @xmath104 $ ] if only certain control functions are allowed to be used in the system .    while our main results make use of properties that are to some extent particular to ( [ eq : wong : bi ] ) , it is important to note that the system ( [ eq : wong : bi ] ) has features of an intrinsically geometric nature in common with a much larger class of two - input `` drift - free '' control systems whose output mappings are not necessarily bilinear functionals of the inputs .",
    "these systems arise in applications including the kinematic control of nonholonomic wheeled vehicles ( see , e.g.  @xcite . ) and the control of ensembles of spin systems arising in coherent spectroscopy and quantum information processing .",
    "( see @xcite . )",
    "to illustrate how important features of a broad class of two - input systems are held in common with ( [ eq : wong : bi ] ) , we consider the bloch equations in a spatially fixed frame in which there is an rf - inhomogeneity but no larmor dispersion .",
    "the system is governed by ordinary differential equations evolving on the rotation group @xmath113 .",

    "we can visualize the algorithm by moving down a binary tree , so that depending on the value of the bit sent by either one of the agents in the communication protocol , we descend from a given node to its left or right child .",

    "the target matrix that is collaboratively evaluated by the agents in phase two is the sub - matrix that had been selected in phase one .",
    "it is assumed that in phase one , communication of negligible cost ( e.g.  @xmath22-signaling ) occurs , but that in phase two , open - loop controls of the form described in section 5 realize the output specified in the chosen sub - matrix .",
    "it is clear that one can construct two - phase protocols with total control cost arbitrarily close to ( [ eq : cost ] ) , the lower bound for all protocols realizing @xmath59 .",

    "the infimum control cost of any multi - round protocol that realizes @xmath88 is given by : @xmath412    by comparing the control cost of an optimal single round protocol as given by ( [ eqn : thm1 ] ) with that of the multi - round protocol ( [ eq : thm7.2 ] ) , one can estimate the value of communicated bits in reducing the control energy cost . using the target matrix @xmath413 of ( [ eq : jb : target ] ) as an example , for the b - h system the minimal control cost without using any communication",
    "is defined in equation ( [ eq : thm5.1 ] ) and has a value of @xmath414 .",
    "if communication cost is negligible then the minimal control cost is approximated by the right - hand - side of ( [ eq : thm7.1 ] ) and has a value of @xmath415 .",
    "this can be achieved by the information sharing protocol shown in figure [ fig1 ] , which has a protocol complexity of 6 ( @xmath416 two times the length of the binary tree ) . the protocol complexity is a `` worst case '' metric , reflecting the maximum number of bits that might need to be communicated .",
    "thus , the value of a single communication bit in reducing the control energy cost for this problem is at least @xmath417 with the units being control energy ( as defined by ( [ eq : control cost ] ) ) per bit .",
    "this paper has continued our study of problems in control communication complexity , which may be viewed as an extension of classical communication complexity with the additional focus on control cost .",
    "there are several important application contexts in which the optimization problems of the type we have considered seem to arise naturally . the single round protocols for steering the b - h system realizes the solution to a problem in distributed computing where independent agents act to evaluate a function without foreknowledge of each other s choices . as was noted in @xcite , the problems also arise naturally in what we have called the _ standard parts optimal control problem _ in which it is desired to find a specific number , @xmath7 , of control inputs to a given input - output system that can be used in different combinations to attain a certain number , @xmath8 , of output objectives so as to minimize the cost of control averaged over the different objectives .",
    "the connection with quantum control , and in particular , the control of quantum spin systems ( see for example the references to quantum control and computation in @xcite ) is another interesting line of investigation that is under way and will be treated elsewhere .",
