    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most luminous and intriguing explosions in the universe .",
    "a number of physical interpretations for grbs have been proposed since they were discovered about four decades ago .",
    "the most successful model for grbs and their afterglows is the fireball shock model ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "although the interpretation for the prompt gamma - ray emission is still controversial even in this standard scenario , the long - wavelength afterglows have been widely accepted to be the emission from relativistic shocks sweeping up an external medium ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    in spite of the success of the standard external shock model for interpreting most features of afterglows ,",
    "there are still a few issues recently raised by the _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) @xcite .",
    "the first issue is the ubiquitously detected shallow decay of early x - ray afterglows @xcite . in general , to account for the shallow decay , a ",
    "refreshed shock \" scenario is assumed , either by a continuous activity of the grb progenitor @xcite , or by a power - law distribution of the lorentz factors in the ejecta @xcite .",
    "however , although the ",
    "refreshed shock \" model is generally able to explain the flatter temporal x - ray slopes from current analysis , it may not be able to explain self - consistently both the x - ray and the optical afterglows of some well - monitored grbs , such as grb 050319 and grb 050401 @xcite .",
    "the second issue is the lack of jet breaks that are supposed to be detected simultaneously in x - ray and optical light curves @xcite .",
    "this raises a serious concern about our understanding of the afterglow emission .",
    "currently , possible solutions to this problem are additional mechanisms taking place in the early x - ray emission @xcite , x - ray emission arising from different outflows with the optical emission @xcite , or alternatively , the temporal break in x - rays is masked by some additional source of x - ray emission @xcite , so that a jet break at the expected time could still be seen in the optical band .",
    "the last interpretation may bring renaissance to the physical meaning of a jet break @xcite and @xmath0 @xcite , and therefore revive the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite realized that the impulsive prompt x - ray emission scattering off the surrounding medium could give rise to a long - term x - ray flux , which is comparable to that of most observed afterglows .",
    "the scattered x - ray emission ( which is called echo emission herein ) could be an additional contributor to the early x - ray afterglow , which was originally put forward by @xcite and then further discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite also worked out detailed light curves of the echo emission that could nicely reproduce most of the temporal features of observed x - ray afterglows , i.e. , a shallow decay followed by a ",
    "normal \" decay and a further rapid decay @xcite .",
    "this scenario provides a self - consistent solution to both the shallow decay and the jet break problem . by fitting the x - ray light curves of grb 060813 and grb 060814 ,",
    "@xcite concluded that the scattering medium , i.e. , a dusty shell should be at a distance of about tens of parsecs from the grb source .",
    "coincidentally , this conjectured dusty shell by @xcite is consistent with the massive wind bubble around a wolf - rayet ( wr ) star , which has been proposed as the progenitor of a grb .",
    "the study of stellar structure and evolution has provided a mass - loss history of a massive star , starting with the main sequence ( ms ) stage as an o star , which will evolve into a wr star and then produce a final supernova and/or a grb . by the computation of stellar wind and atmosphere models for a o - type star of 60 @xmath2 mass , @xcite concluded that the stellar mass lost to the wind bubble is about 32 @xmath2 in the ms stage , 8 @xmath2 in the luminous blue variable ( lbv ) stage , and 16 @xmath2 in the wr stage .",
    "such a massive wind bubble will produce a significant shell mainly swept up by the ms wind at the time of the supernova or grb ( see fig.[fig : bubble ] ) , with a distance from the progenitor of about @xmath3 tens of parsecs @xcite .",
    "if the clumps formed during the lbv and wr stages survive long enough , they will be hitting the ms shell roughly at the time of the supernova or grb @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we apply the echo emission model to a sample of 36 grbs with well - monitored x - ray light curves by the xrt onboard _",
    "swift_. we find that most of the light curves without significant flares can be reproduced by our model . in this sample ,",
    "14 bursts have available redshifts by observations . by fitting their x - ray light curves",
    ", we find the distance @xmath4 of the wind bubbles from grb progenitors .",
    "a measurement of @xmath5 might bring us closer to finding the mass loss rate , density and wind velocity of the progenitor prior to the explosion .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : in @xmath6[sec : bubble ] , we first discuss the existence of massive stellar wind bubbles around grbs when they explodes and the subsequent x - ray echo emission .",
    "we formulate the theoretical light curves of x - ray echo emission in @xmath6[sec : theory ] , and we introduce the temporal break in echo emission and fit the observational light curves of 36 grbs in @xmath6[sec : break ] .",
    "discussion and conclusions follow in @xmath6[sec : discuss ] .",
    "it has been shown by @xcite with a detailed calculation following @xcite that , the fiducial flux of the echo emission could be comparable to an already observed x - ray afterglow at some certain time , given that the prompt x - rays from a grb are significantly scattered by the circumstellar dust . here",
    ", we provide a more concise approach by order - of - magnitude estimation .",
    "evidence accumulated in the last few years has verified the long - hypothesized origin of soft grbs in the deaths of wr stars ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "it is generally believed that the progenitor wr star will blow out a hot bubble in the interstellar medium ( ism ) by massive stellar wind @xcite .",
    "the typical radius of the dense shell of swept - up surrounding ism is of order tens of parsecs , as given by a self - similar solution @xcite @xmath7 where the mass - loss rate during the ms stage @xmath8 , the typical wind velocity @xmath9 km / s , and the lifetime of the ms stage @xmath10 yr are adopted for a 35 @xmath11 star @xcite , and the number density of interstellar medium @xmath12 is assumed .",
    "correspondingly , the geometry and density profile of a massive wind bubble around a wr star are shown in fig.[fig : bubble ] .",
    "wr stars  characterized by high mass - loss rate  are believed to form massive dust in their winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , all dust shells that were observed were essentially associated with carbon - rich wr stars of the latest subtypes of the wc sequence only ( which are called wc stars herein , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "wc stars are the final evolutionary phase of the most massive ( @xmath13 ) stars , which , in some sense seem to be favored here as the progenitors of some grbs , since there is where echo emission would be most efficient .    assuming that an x - ray burst ( i.e. , the x - ray counterpart of a prompt grb produced at the final stage of a wc star ) with a fluence @xmath14 is scattered by the dusty shell at a distance @xmath4 with a scattering optical depth @xmath15 , the echo emission is spread within a characteristic time scale @xmath16 , due to the scattering delay of x - rays with different scattering angles @xmath17 ( see fig.[fig : bubble ] for the geometry of scattering ) .",
    "since the characteristic scattering angle @xmath17 is physically small @xcite , the time scale @xmath16 is consequently much smaller than @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the speed of light .",
    "therefore , we have a fiducial flux of the x - ray echo emission over a time @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath14 is the total fluence of the burst observed in x - ray band ( say , 0.3 - 10 kev ) , the echo flux and the source flux are assumed to suffer the same interstellar absorption on their way to the observer , and the cosmological @xmath22-correction is ignored .",

    "* ) , especially those from the soft tail emission in most grbs , are not included in this approximation .",
    "since the scattering angle @xmath17 is very small , we have @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the redshift of the grb , and @xmath17 is the typical scattering angle of x - ray echo emission @xcite .",
    "hence , we have three interesting coincidences :    1 .",
    "the dusty shell at a distance @xmath4 of about tens of parsecs assumed by @xcite is consistent with the massive wind bubble around a wr star at its final stage @xcite ; 2 .",
    "the timescale of the x - ray echo emission on such a wind bubble is about @xmath29 s , which is the typical timescale when the shallow decay phase dominates in x - ray afterglow @xcite ; 3 .",
    "the x - ray echo flux @xmath30 from such a wind bubble is consistent with most of both pre-_swift _ and _ swift _ x - ray afterglows around @xmath31 s ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these three coincidences motivate the study of echo emission as an additional contributor to the x - ray emission .",
    "in what follows , we work out the light curve of the echo emission , and show the fourth and the most spectacular coincidence that the theoretical light curves of x - ray afterglows are consistent with the observed ones .",
    "@xcite have derived the temporal profile of the echo emission .",
    "they showed that the feature in the x - ray light curve of a shallow decay followed by a ",
    "normal \" decay and a further steepening could be reproduced , given that the grains in the dusty shell have a distribution over size and that the scattering is dependent on the wavelength of x - rays through the rayleigh - gans approximation . according to @xcite",
    ", this theoretical light curve can be formulated as @xmath32\\}{1\\over t } { \\rm d}a{\\rm d}e , \\label{eq : lightcurve}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is a constant , @xmath34 is the energy of an x - ray photon , @xmath35 is the size of a grain in the dusty shell , and we define the following functions @xmath36 , \\label{eq : s}\\ ] ]    @xmath37^{-s}\\left({a\\over0.1\\,\\micron}\\right)^{4-q},\\ ] ]    @xmath38    @xmath39    @xmath40    where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the spectral index and the observed peak energy of the source @xcite , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the power - law indices in the formula of scattering optical depth @xcite , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the cutoff sizes of dust grains @xcite , @xmath47 $ ] is the energy band of the detector , and @xmath48 is the planck constant ( see the appendix for a detailed derivation ) .",
    "thanks to the _ swift _ satellite @xcite , our interpretation of grbs has become more complex .",
    "the feature of a shallow decay followed by a  normal \" decay and a further rapid decay of x - ray afterglows appears to be canonical @xcite .",
    "coincidentally , we find that this feature can be naturally reproduced by the echo emission .    well - monitored x - ray light curves of 36 grbs ( see fig . [",
    "fig : lightcurve ] ) were fitted by our theoretical model above ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : lightcurve ] ) , using the online data by @xcite .",
    "a total of 14 events have known redshifts ( see tab . [",

    "[ tab : noredshift ] ) .",
    "we assume @xmath50 kev and @xmath51 kev for _ swift _ xrt @xcite , @xmath52 @xcite , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 kev @xcite .",

    "[ tab : redshift ] and tab .",
    "[ tab : noredshift ] .",
    "apparently , @xmath46 is almost a constant here ( i.e. , @xmath55 , except @xmath56 for grb 050505 ) and consistent with most results from optical observations @xcite .    here @xmath33 is a numerical coefficient , which is equal to 2@xmath57 as shown in the appendix .",
    "@xmath58 is the coefficient in the integrated grb spectrum between 0.3 and 10 kev , which is not available based on current working frequency of bat onboard _",
    "swift_. similarly , @xmath59 is hardly determined by current observations about the x - ray optical depth .",
    "a further analysis of the parameter @xmath58 and @xmath59 is required once the relevant observational data are sufficient .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurve ] , all the light curves approach to a steep decay ( @xmath60 ) , which is already predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lightcurve ] ) .",

    ", we can indirectly derive the distant @xmath4 for a given event at redshift @xmath28 ( see table [ tab : redshift ] ) .",
    "these values of @xmath4 appear to be consistent with the observed radii of wind bubbles around wc stars @xcite .",
    "for bursts without known redshifts we only list a pesudo value of the bubble radius @xmath66 assuming a fixed redshift @xmath49 ( see table [ tab : noredshift ] ) .",
    "the larger scatter in @xmath66 values for the latter group appears to be a direct consequence of the arbitrary @xmath49 prescription .",
    "recently , @xcite provided a comprehensive analysis of shallow decays and `` normal '' decay segments in grbs",
    ". they concluded in their sample that most grbs in these two segments have a spectral index @xmath67 around @xmath68 ( as the flux density @xmath69 ) .",
    "here we can also get a knowledge of the spectrum of echo emission based on our analysis ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : fluxdensity ] ) . approximately , when @xmath62\\simeq \\pi$ ] at a given time @xmath70 , we have    @xmath71    where @xmath70 is about an order of magnitude larger than @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : td ] ) , and roughly equals most of the @xmath73 s defined in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we should have the spectral index @xmath74 before @xmath70 , since the spectrum of echo emission is softening in the long run . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] , the hardness ratio of echo emission is monotonously decreasing .",
    "interestingly , it reaches a platform ( instead of an extremum proposed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) almost around @xmath70 and then keeps decreasing very slowly .",
    "if we assume @xmath75 @xcite and @xmath76 @xcite , we should have @xmath77 .",
    "this seems to be inconsistent with the observational result by @xcite , since they ended up with @xmath78 .",
    "however , we have two reasons that lead us to be content with our result based on current analysis . first",
    ", since we are dealing with the prompt x - ray emission and the @xmath75 here is the result from hard x - rays by batse @xcite , we can imagine that the real average @xmath41 should be larger than 0 .",
    "specifically , based on the standard synchrotron emission , @xmath41 should equal @xmath79 , and the synchrotron self - absorption leads to @xmath80 .",
    "second , the rayleigh - gans approximation is adopted here to calculate the differential cross section of scattering .",
    "this approximation overestimates the echo emission at softer x - ray band ( say , in 0.3 - 1.5 kev ) , where absorption is important , which will change the spectral shape in soft x - ray band and alleviate the dilemma of a dramatically small hardness ratio in fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] . based on the current analysis ,",
    "it is safe to say that -2 is only a lower limit for @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , our result here is generally consistent with the observations .",
    "thus , the echo emission can not be completely ruled out for the reason as discussed by @xcite .",
    "originally , the optical echo emission was used to explain the red bumps observed in some optical afterglows @xcite . however , since the typical optical / infrared scattering angle would be about @xmath81 @xcite , the timescale in eq.([eq : timescale ] ) would be longer , and the optical / infrared echo emission would be much weaker , and hard to be detected @xcite . nevertheless , if the wr wind within a much shorter distance ( @xmath82 cm ) is also taken into account , there might be detectable variations in the optical afterglows due to echo emission @xcite .",
    "however , the average lbv or wr wind bubble around a massive star at its death would be much larger @xcite .",
    "therefore , the features of echo emission in the optical band would be not significant enough , which is possibly the reason that the standard external shock model was more successful in the pre-_swift _ era , when the optical observations dominated .",
    "furthermore , the dramatic variations in the lbv or / and wr winds would drive instabilities that produce radial filaments in the lbv or wr shells @xcite , which could be the origin of some flares in the x - rays afterglows @xcite .",
    "therefore , there might be another timescale due to the angular variation of these filaments , which could be given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the distance of the filaments from the progenitor and @xmath85 is the typical angular size of the clumps and ripples in the filaments . to account for the mean ratio of the width and peak time of the x - ray flares @xcite , i.e. , @xmath86 , we may have @xmath87 .",
    "@xcite claimed on a different scattering circumstance ( molecular and atomic matter instead of dust grains ) that the opening angle of jets might be an important factor to the echo light curve , based on the popular assumption that the grb prompt emission is beamed . since only small - angle scattering ( @xmath88 ) for dust grains",
    "is considered here , the typical jet properly pointing at us with a much larger opening angle of about few degrees will not affect out results .",
    "however , the grb jet might be pointing at us with its edge in some case , where our result here would not be valid . instead , a rapid drop that is much steeper than @xmath89 will emerge at a late time @xcite .",
    "this is probably the case for some grbs , e.g. , grb 060526 @xcite .    in this paper , we have presented the x - ray echo emission in grb phenomenon and we can draw the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "the shallow decay phase can still be understood without additional contributions from the central engine @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the feature of a shallow decay followed by a  normal \" decay and a further rapid decay can be reproduced by the echo from the prompt x - ray emission scattered by the massive wind bubble around the progenitor @xcite . in general",
    ", dust formation seems to be prevailing in carbon - rich wr stars of the wc subtype and there is where echo emission would be most efficient .",
    "echo emission can be an additional x - ray source that masked the x - ray jet breaks @xcite .",
    "therefore , the lack of jet breaks @xcite might also be understood via competing echo emission .",
    "in addition , some results in the pre-_swift _ era , say , some correlations relevant for optical breaks might still be valid @xcite .",
    "3 .   there is an extra temporal break in x - ray echo emission introduced by @xmath90 above . by fitting the light curves",
    ", we can indirectly measure the locations of the massive wind bubbles , which will bring us closer to finding the mass loss rate , wind velocity , and the age of the progenitors prior to the grb explosions @xcite .",
    "even though some features in x - ray afterglows would be better understood if the echo emission is taken into account , the external shock model is still the dominant scenario for optical / infrared afterglows , since echo emission is negligible in the later .",
    "in addition , the echo emission model does not completely rule out other interpretations ( energy injection , etc . ) in the framework of the fireball - shock model .",
    "technically , echo emission takes place at a distance of @xmath91 tens of parsecs , while the internal or / and external shocks are believed to take place within a distance of @xmath92 cm .",
    "it is more likely that both of them are taking place in the x - ray afterglow , which potentially complicates the light curves .",
    "however , this may raise the problem about grb radiative efficiencies again . even by assuming that the x - ray emission is the forward shock emission , the grb efficiency is already too high to be accommodated by the leading internal shock models ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "assuming an echo - dominated x - ray emission would exacerbate the situation .",
