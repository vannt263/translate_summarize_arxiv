    "gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) were first detected in the late 1960 s by military satellites monitoring for compliance with the nuclear test ban treaty .",
    "this became public information only several years later , with the publication of the results from the vela satellites @xcite , which were quickly confirmed by data from the soviet konus satellites @xcite .",
    "their nature and origin remained thereafter a mystery for more than two decades , largely due to the fact that during this period they remained detectable only for tens of seconds , almost exclusively at gamma - ray energies ( e.g. ) , with occasional reports at x - ray energies ( e.g. ) .",
    "various satellites continued to accumulate data on hundreds of grb over the years , attracting an increasing amount of attention and leading to a large variety of theoretical models ( e.g. ) .",
    "a new era in grb research opened in 1991 with the launch of the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) , whose ground - breaking results have been summarized in .",
    "the most significant results came from the all - sky survey by the burst and transient experiment ( batse ) on cgro , which recorded over 2700 bursts , complemented by data from the osse , comptel and egret experiments .",
    "batse s earliest and most dramatic result was that it showed that grb were essentially isotropically distributed in the sky , with no significant dipole or quadrupole moments , suggesting a cosmological distribution @xcite .",
    "the spectra were non - thermal , the number of photons per unit photon energy varying typically as a power - law @xmath0 , where @xmath1 at low energies changes to @xmath2 above a photon energy @xmath3 mev @xcite .",
    "this spectral power law dependence was found to extend in several bursts up to at least gev energies @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray light curves show a time dependence ranging from a smooth , fast - rise and quasi - exponential decay , through curves with several peaks , to variable curves with many peaks , and substructure sometimes down to milliseconds ( fig .",
    "[ fig : batselc ] ) .",
    "the durations at mev energies range from @xmath4 s to about @xmath5 s , with a well - defined bimodal distribution for bursts longer or shorter than @xmath6 s @xcite .",
    "there is also an anti - correlation between spectral hardness and duration , the short one being harder , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the pulse distribution is complex , and the time histories of the emission as a function of energy can provide clues for the geometry or physics of the emitting regions ( e.g. ) .",
    "the results from batse sharpened the debate on whether the grb were of a galactic or extragalactic origin , e.g. @xcite , but the accumulating evidence increasingly swung the balance in favor of the cosmological interpretation .",
    "= 0.89    a decisive watershed was reached in 1997 , when the italian - dutch satellite beppo - sax succeeded in obtaining the first high resolution x - ray images @xcite of the fading afterglow of a burst , grb 970228 , which had been expected on theoretical grounds .",
    "this discovery was promptly followed by an increasing list of other burst detections by beppo - sax , at the approximate rate of 10 per year .",
    "these x - ray detections , after a 4 - 6 hour delay needed for data processing , led to arc - minute accuracy positions , which finally made possible the optical detection and the follow - up of the grb afterglows at longer wavelengths ( e.g. ) .",
    "this paved the way for the measurement of redshift distances , the identification of candidate host galaxies , and the confirmation that they were at cosmological distances ( , etc . ) . over 40 grb afterglows",
    "have been located as of late 2001 in x - rays and optical , and more than a dozen in radio @xcite .",
    "some afterglows have been followed over time scales of many months to over a year , and in the majority of cases ( over 30 ) they have also resulted in the identification of the likely host galaxy @xcite .",
    "a recent review of the observations and phenomenology of grb afterglows is in .",
    "at cosmological distances the observed grb fluxes imply energies of @xmath7 erg , if the emission is isotropic ( see however  [ sec : jet ] ) , and from causality this must be liberated inside regions whose size is @xmath8 kilometers on time scales @xmath9 seconds . independently of the nature and details of the progenitor and the trigger , such an intense , localized and brief explosion implies the formation of an @xmath10 fireball @xcite . in the context of a cosmological model , the fireball",
    "would be expected to expand relativistically @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis is natural , since most of the spectral energy is observed at @xmath11 mev , so the optical depth against @xmath12 is huge , and the expansion follows from the highly super - eddington value of the luminosity .",
    "since many bursts emit a large fraction of their luminosity at photon energies @xmath13 mev , the flow must somehow be able to avoid the process @xmath12 degrading the observed photons to just below 0.511 mev .",
    "a highly relativistic expansion is , in fact , strongly supported by the fact that it provides a natural explanation for the observed photons with @xmath14 0.5 mev @xcite .",
    "this is because in this case the relative angle at which the photons collide must be less than the inverse of the bulk lorentz factor @xmath15 and the effective threshold energy for pair production is correspondingly reduced .",
    "roughly , the lorentz factor must satisfy 10 ^ 2 ( _ /10 gev)^1/2(_t / mev)^1/2  , in order for photons with @xmath16 gev to escape annihilation against target photons with @xmath17 mev .",
    "( a more detailed calculation is in ) .",
    "from general considerations @xcite , a relativistic outflow arising from an initial energy @xmath18 imparted to a mass @xmath19 starting out from a radius @xmath20 leads to an expansion , as the gas converts its internal energy into bulk kinetic energy .",
    "initially the bulk lorentz @xmath21 , while the comoving temperature drops @xmath22 .",
    "clearly , @xmath23 can not increase beyond @xmath24 , which occurs at a saturation @xmath25 , beyond which the flow continues to coast with @xmath26 constant .",
    "the simplicity of the original fireball picture , however , led to some serious difficulties . among these",
    "are that the expansion of the fireball should lead to a conversion of most of its internal energy into kinetic energy of the entrained baryons , rather than into photon luminosity , hence it would be energetically very inefficient .",
    "furthermore , it would produce a quasi - thermal photon spectrum , instead of the observed power - law spectra ; and the typical time scales over which these photons escape is comparable to that during which the flow makes a transition to optical thinness ( milliseconds ) , which could not explain the many events lasting much longer than that .",
    "this efficiency , timescale and spectrum problems can be solved with the _ fireball shock _ model , in its external @xcite and internal @xcite versions .",
    "this is based on the fact that shocks are likely to occur in such an outflow , and if these occur after the fireball has become optically thin , these shocks would reconvert the kinetic energy of the baryons into nonthermal particle and photon energy .    _",
    "external _ shocks @xcite will occur , unavoidably , in any outflow of total energy @xmath18 in an external medium of average particle density @xmath27 at a radius and on a timescale r_dec ~ & 10 ^ 17 e_53 ^ 1/3 n_o^-1/3 _ 2 ^",

    "the external shock synchrotron spectra @xcite and combined synchrotron - ic spectra @xcite reproduce in a general manner the observed gamma - ray spectral properties , as do the predicted spectral - temporal correlations (; c.f . ) .",
    "( however , internal shocks present an alternative for the brief burst of gamma - ray emission , motivated by variability issues , see below ) .",
    "external shocks also serve as the model of choice for the afterglow radiation (  [ sec : after ] ) .",
    "the typical observer - frame dynamic time of the shock is @xmath30 seconds , for typical parameters , and @xmath31 would be the burst duration ( the impulsive assumption requires that the initial energy input occur in a time shorter than @xmath32 ) .",
    "variability on timescales shorter than @xmath33 may occur on the cooling timescale or on the dynamic timescale for inhomogeneities in the external medium , but this is not widely favored for reproducing highly variable profiles .",
    "(; c.f . ) .",
    "they could , however , reproduce bursts with several peaks @xcite and may therefore be applicable to the class of long , smooth bursts .    _",
    "internal _ shocks @xcite address another problem , posed by some of the rapidly variable @xmath23-ray light curves , which for total durations of tens to hundreds of seconds are , sometimes , endowed with variability down to milliseconds or less @xcite .",
    "one ingredient in solving this problem is to postulate a  central engine \" @xcite which ejects energy at a variable rate .",
    "this could be , e.g. magnetic flares in a transient accretion disk around a central compact object resulting from the disruption of a merging compact binary @xcite . by itself , such a variable central engine is however not enough to explain the variable light curves , since a relativistic outflow is inevitable , and even if intermittent , this outflow will be on average optically thick to compton scattering out to very large radii , leading to a smoothing - out of the light curve .",
    "this difficulty , however , is solved with the introduction of the internal shock model @xcite , in which the time - varying outflow from the central engine leads to successive shells ejected with different lorentz factors .",
    "multiple shocks form as faster shells overtake slower ones , and the crucial point is that for a range of plausible parameters , this occurs above the compton photosphere .",
    "these shocks are called internal because they arise from the flow interacting with itself , rather than with the external environment .",
    "one can model the central engine outflow as a wind of duration @xmath34 , whose average dynamics is similar to that of the impulsive outflows described previously , with an average lab - frame luminosity @xmath35 and average mass outflow @xmath36 , and mean saturation lorentz factor @xmath37 .",
    "significant variations of order @xmath38 occurring over timescales @xmath39 will lead then to internal shocks @xcite at radii @xmath40 above the photosphere @xmath41 , r_dis ~ & c t_var ^2 ~310 ^ 14 t_var _ 2 ^ 2   cm , r_phot ~ & m_t /(4m_p",

    "[ eq : rdis ] the above assumes the photosphere to be above the saturation radius @xmath42 , so that most of the energy comes out in the shocks , rather than in the photospheric quasi - thermal component ( such photospheric effects are discussed in ) . for shocks above the photosphere , large observable @xmath23-ray variations are possible on timescales @xmath43 , for an outflow originating from a central object of mass @xmath44 at radii @xmath45 .",
    "the internal shock model was specifically designed to allow an arbitrarily complicated light curve @xcite on timescales down to ms , the optically thin shocks producing the required non - thermal spectrum . numerical calculations @xcite confirm that the light curves can indeed be as complicated as observed by batse in extreme cases .",
    "( by contrast , in external shocks the variations are expected to be smoothed out by relativistic time delays , e.g. , at most a few peaks being possible , e.g. .",
    "an alternative view invoking large variability from blobs in external shocks is discussed by ) .",
    "the observed power density spectra of grb light curves @xcite provide an additional constraint on the dynamics of the shell ejection by the central engine and the efficiency of internal shocks @xcite .",
    "when internal shocks occur , these are generally expected to be followed @xcite by an external shock , a sequential combination sometimes referred to as the internal - external shock scenario @xcite .",
    "the grb external shocks , similarly to what is observed in supernova remnants , consist of a forward shock or blast wave moving into the external medium ahead of the ejecta , and a reverse shock moving back into the ejecta as the latter is decelerated by the inertia the external medium .",
    "the internal shocks would consist of forward and reverse shocks of a more symmetrical nature . as in interplanetary shocks studied with spacecraft probes , the internal and external shocks in grb are tenuous , and expected to be collisionless , i.e. mediated by chaotic electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the minimum random lorentz factor of protons going through the shocks should be comparable to the relative bulk lorentz factor , while that of the electrons may exceed this by a factor of up to the ratio of the proton to the electron mass .",
    "the energy of the particles can be further boosted by diffusive shock acceleration @xcite as they scatter repeatedly across the shock interface , acquiring a power law distribution @xmath46 , where @xmath47 . in the presence of turbulent magnetic fields built up behind the shocks",
    ", the electrons produce a synchrotron power - law radiation spectrum @xcite similar to that observed @xcite , while the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of these synchrotron photons extends the spectrum into the gev range @xcite .",
    "comparisons of a synchrotron hypothesis for the mev radiation with data have been made by , e.g. .",
    "the effects of pair production and inverse compton on the prompt spectra are discussed in  [ sec : pairs ] .",
    "it is worth stressing that the fireball shock scenario , whether internal or external , is fairly generic : it is largely independent of the details of the progenitor .",
    "although it is somewhat geometry dependent , the central engine generally lies enshrouded and out of view inside the optically thick outflow . even after the latter becomes optically thin",
    ", the progenitor s remnant emission should be practically undetectable , compared to the emission of the fireball shock which is its main manifestation ( see , however ,  [ sec : cosm ] ) .",
    "the external shock becomes important when the inertia of the swept up external matter leads to an appreciable slowing down of the ejecta .",
    "as the fireball continues to plow ahead , it sweeps up an increasing amount of external matter , made up of interstellar gas plus possibly gas which was previously ejected by the progenitor star . as the external shock builds up , for high radiative efficiency its bolometric luminosity rises approximately as @xmath48 .",
    "this follows from equating in the contact discontinuity frame the kinetic flux @xmath49 to the external ram pressure @xmath50 during the initial phase while @xmath51 constant , @xmath52 (; see also ) . after peaking , or plateauing in the thick shell limit ,",
    "as the lorentz factor decreases one expects a gradual dimming @xmath53 ( from energy conservation @xmath54 under adiabatic conditions , @xmath55 takes into account radiative effects or bolometric corrections ) . at the deceleration radius ( [ eq : rdec ] ) the fireball energy and the bulk lorentz factor decrease by a factor @xmath56 over a timescale @xmath57 , and thereafter the bulk lorentz factor decreases as a power law in radius , r^-gt^-g/(1 + 2 g )  ,  rt^1/(1 + 2 g ) , [ eq : gamma ] with @xmath58 for the radiative ( adiabatic ) regime , in which @xmath59 constant ( @xmath60 constant ) . at late times",

    "the spectrum of radiation is likely to be due to synchrotron radiation , whose peak frequency in the observer frame is @xmath62 , and both the comoving field @xmath63 and the minimum electron lorentz factor @xmath64 are likely to be proportional to @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "this implies that as @xmath23 decreases , so will @xmath65 , and the radiation will move to longer wavelengths .",
    "consequences of this are the expectation that the burst would leave a radio remnant @xcite after some weeks , and before that an optical @xcite transient .",
    "the first self - consistent afterglow calculations @xcite took into account both the dynamical evolution and its interplay with the relativistic particle acceleration and a specific relativistically beamed radiation mechanism resulted in quantitative predictions for the entire spectral evolution , going through the x - ray , optical and radio range . for a spherical fireball advancing into an approximately smooth external environment , the bulk lorentz factor decreases as in inverse power of the time ( asymptotically @xmath66 in the adiabatic limit ) , and the accelerated electron minimum random lorentz factor and the turbulent magnetic field also decrease as inverse power laws in time . the synchrotron peak energy corresponding to the time - dependent minimum lorentz factor and magnetic field then move to softer energies as @xmath67 .",
    "these can be generalized in a straightforward manner when in the radiative regime , or in presence of density gradients , etc .. the radio spectrum is initially expected to be self - absorbed , and becomes optically thin after a few days . for times beyond about one hour the dominant radiation is from the forward shock , for which the flux at a given frequency and the synchrotron peak frequency decay as @xcite f_t^-(3/2 )  ,  _",

    "departures from the simplest standard model occur , e.g. if the external medium is inhomogeneous .",

    "such a power law dependence is expected if the external medium is a wind , say from an evolved progenitor star , and light curve to some bursts fit better with such a hypothesis @xcite , whereas in many objects a homogeneous medium seems a better fit @xcite ( for a critical discussion see ) .",
    "another obvious non - standard effect is departures from a simple impulsive injection approximation ( i.e. an injection which is not a delta or a top hat function with a single value for @xmath18 and @xmath95 in time ) . an example is if the mass and energy injected during the burst duration @xmath34 ( say tens of seconds ) obeys @xmath96 , @xmath97 , i.e. more energy emitted with lower lorentz factors at later times , but still shorter than the gamma - ray pulse duration ( refreshed shocks ) .",

    "while the @xmath204 interactions leading to @xmath213 tev energy neutrinos provide a direct probe of the internal shock acceleration process , as well as of the mev photon density associated with them , the @xmath214 pev neutrinos would probe the reverse external shocks , as well as the photon energies and energy density there .",
    "the most intense neutrino signals , however , may be due to @xmath204 interactions occurring _ inside _ collapsars while the jet is still burrowing its way out of the star @xcite , before it has had a chance to break through ( or not ) the stellar envelope to produce a grb outside of it . while still inside the star , the buried jet produces thermal x - rays at @xmath188 kev which interact with @xmath215 gev protons which could be accelerated in internal shocks occurring well inside the jet / stellar envelope terminal shock , producing @xmath107 few tev neutrinos for tens of seconds , which penetrate the envelope ( figure [ fig : jetnu ] ) .",
    "this energy is close to the maximum sensitivity for detection , and the number of neutrinos is also larger for the same total energy output .",
    "the rare bright , nearby or high @xmath23 collapsars could occur at the rate of @xmath216/year , including both @xmath23-ray bright grbs ( where the jet broke through the envelope ) and @xmath23-ray dark events where the jet is choked ( failed to break through ) , and both such @xmath23-bright and dark events could have a tev neutrino fluence of @xmath160/neutrinos / burst , detectable by icecube in individual bursts .",
    "gev to tev photon production is another consequence of the photo - pion and inelastic collisions responsible for the ultra - high energy neutrinos @xcite .",
    "this is in addition to the gev emission from electron inverse compton in internal @xcite and external shocks and afterglows @xcite . in these models , due to the high photon densities implied by grb models ,",
    "@xmath119 absorption within the grb emission region must be taken into account ( see also ) .",
    "a tentative @xmath217 tev detection of an individual grb has been reported with the water cherenkov detector milagrito @xcite , and better sensitivity is expected from its larger version milagro as well as from atmospheric cherenkov telescopes under construction such as veritas , hess , magic and cangaroo - iii @xcite .",
    "grb detections in the tev range are expected only for rare nearby events , since at this energy the mean free path against @xmath119 absorption on the diffuse ir photon background is @xmath107 few hundred mpc @xcite .",
    "the mean free path is much larger at gev energies , and based on the handful of grb reported in this range with egret @xcite , several hundred should be detectable with large area space - based detectors such as glast @xcite , in coincidence with the neutrino pulses and the usual mev @xmath23-ray event .",
    "their detection would provide important constraints on the emission mechanism and the progenitors of grbs .",
    "grb are also expected to be sources of gravitational waves .",
    "a time - integrated luminosity of the order of a solar rest mass ( @xmath218 erg ) is predicted from merging ns - ns and ns - bh models @xcite , while the luminosity from collapsar models is more model - dependent , but expected to be lower (; c.f . ) .",
    "the rates of gravitational wave events @xcite detectable by the laser interferometric gravitational wave observatory ( ligo , currently under construction ) from compact binary mergers , in coincidence with grbs , has been estimated at a few / year for the initial ligo , and up to 10 - 15/year after the upgrades planned 2 - 4 years after first operations .",
    "the observation of such gravitational waves is greatly facilitated by coincident detections in other channels , either electromagnetic or neutrinos .",
    "detection of gravity wave pulses fitting the templates for compact binary mergers ( or collapsars ) , in coincidence with positive grb localizations , would have a great impact on our understanding of grb progenitor systems .",
    "in conclusion , major advances have been made in the understanding of grb since their discovery almost 30 years ago .",
    "however many questions remain , while new ones arise in the wake of the increasingly sophisticated and extensive observations .",
    "these questions will be addressed with new space missions and ground experiments dedicated to grb studies which will come on - line in the near future .",
    "based on past experience the chances are high that these will bring not only answers but also new surprises and challenges .    _",
