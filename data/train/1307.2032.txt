    "the total reaction / interaction cross section measurements of nuclei at intermediate energy range has been extensively used to investigate the size of nucleus and distribution of nucleon in side the nucleus by the nuclear science community from more than one century @xcite .",
    "the availability of heavy ion beams in intermediate energy range makes possible to explore the structures of nuclei over the wide range in nuclear chart .",
    "the advancement in radioactive ion beam facility ( rib ) in this energy range at various laboratories over the globe open up new opportunities to investigate some new exotic phenomenon .",
    "the study of such exotic nuclei specially those towards the dripline and the investigation of extended dripline are some of the current interest @xcite . although earlier the dripline is well established for @xmath0 which is a doubly magic nuclei .",
    "the neutron separation energy and interaction measurement for @xmath1 and @xmath2 shell region suggest the new magic number of n=16 @xcite which is supported by hoffman in ref .",
    "the measurement of @xmath3 mg and @xmath4al @xcite beyond the dripline given by various mass formulae challenge the earlier predictions and still the investigation of dripline is a new challenge for both the nuclear theoretician and experimentalist . apart from it the one most exotic phenomenon is the investigation of neutron and proton halo feature of some nuclei , which occurs due to the extremely weak bound neutrons that decouple from the nuclear core @xcite .",
    "recently , a new member @xmath5 is included in the family of neutron halo @xcite .",
    "the isotope @xmath5 having n=21 , breaks the shell closure structure and in consequence , a large amount of deformation gets associated with the strong intruder configuration and eventually this nuclear system lie at island of inversion ( ioi ) @xcite .",
