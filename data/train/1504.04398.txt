    "the influence of edge deletion in networks for quantum state  @xcite and energy transfer  @xcite has been studied ; however , the influence of edge perturbation and deletion on the destructive interference of transition amplitudes in a network @xcite remains unexplored . in this paper",
    "we consider this problem in a fully connected network and show how the energy can be transferred in the network via deletion of a single edge .",
    "we analyze quantum energy transport in a simple model of a complete network of two - state nodes .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate how energy transfer in such a network , which is inhibited by localization due to destructive interference , can be enhanced by breaking the symmetry between the nodes , or introducing disorder in the coupling between the network nodes .",
    "our work is relevant from the point of view of building an artificial network for high efficient energy transfer to simulate systems such as fmo complexes in photosynthetic structures .",

    "we assume that the nodes interact with each other through direct hopping .",
    "when hopping between two molecules is allowed , a link is drawn between them .",
    "whenever an excitation is inserted at one node , it can then be transfered throughout the network by hopping due to the interaction between the linked nodes .",
    "here we consider quantum energy transport in a network that can be modelled by the following tight - binding hamiltonian  @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the @xmath17-th site in which the excitation exists , @xmath18 denotes the excitation energy at site @xmath17 , and @xmath19 is the hopping integral between the two sites @xmath17 and @xmath20 .",

    "the quantities @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) are the creation ( annihilation ) operators at the site connecting site to the sink , and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) are the creation ( annihilation ) operators at the sink .",

    "this result is a manifestation of the localization of single particle states within a fully connected network as already pointed out in ref . .",

    "this result shows that the state localization inside a fully connected network is highly sensitive to the symmetry of the hamiltonian and any asymmetry due to @xmath54 destroys the destructive interference loops and hence localization in the network .",
    "the important conclusion here is that such a symmerry breaking dramatically increases the efficiency of eet .",

    "next we investigate the influence of a noisy environment on quantum energy transport in networks . in most practical cases",
    "the networks are open  @xcite and interact with the environment , which is expected to reduce quantum coherence and constructive interference .",
    "dephasing effects can be incorporated in the master equation in the framework of the lindblad operators as follows  @xcite : @xmath72   \\label{dephase}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the dephasing rate coefficient .    adding eq .",
    "( [ dephase ] ) to the master equation ( [ master ] ) and integrating this equation as before gives energy transfer in the presence of noise .",
    "figure [ dephasing889 ] represents the time dependence of the sink population in the absence and presence of noise with different values of the dephacing rate coefficient .",
    "the results show that in cases where the wave packet is partially localized in the network , such as in the fully connected ( fig .",
    "[ dephasing889](a ) ) , @xmath70 edge deleted ( fig .  [ dephasing889](c ) ) , and @xmath71 edge deleted ( fig .  [ dephasing889](d ) ) networks , the system efficiency monotonically increases ( both in magnitude and speed ) as dephasing is increased .",
    "therefore , in these networks the noise has a constructive influence on energy transport by reducing quantum coherence .",
    "however , when the hopping between the initial node and the one connecting to the sink ( @xmath69 ) is blocked , the wave packet localization is already destroyed and in this case the noise slows down the speed of energy transfer to the sink as illustrated in fig .  [ dephasing889](b ) .",
    "the results presented here show that the link which connects the initial node to the final node plays a fundamental role in eet , and as fig .",
    "[ pop - j16 ] shows , when @xmath54 is changed from @xmath74 to @xmath75 or from @xmath76 to @xmath77 , complete energy transfer is obtained .",
    "an obvious question then concerns finding a value of @xmath78 which is optimal in the sense that the _ saturation time _",
    "@xmath79 is minimized .",
    "we define @xmath79 to be the time after which the injected energy is transferred to the sink in the absence of dephasing . in fig .",
    "[ sat ] we show numerical results for @xmath79 when varying the hopping rate @xmath54 .",
    "the nontrivial result here is that except for the peak caused by localization , the saturation time decreases with increasing @xmath54 attaining a minimum which is numerically determined to be @xmath80 .     on the hopping rate @xmath54 .",
    "the saturation time is minimized by @xmath80 . ]",
    "in addition to edge deletion considered in the previous sections , it s also possible to introduce disorder explicitly into the hopping integral parameters between the network nodes . in such networks",
    "it is expected that the efficiency is strongly affected .",
    "we have studied this issue by introducing disorder to the couplings by changing @xmath19 to @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is a dimensionless random number with a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath83 $ ] . in fig .",
    "7 we show numerical results for the efficiency parameter @xmath53 as a function of @xmath84 for two fully connected networks with @xmath85 and @xmath86 nodes .",
    "as expected , even a relatively small amount of disorder significantly increases the efficiency in an fcn .",
    "finally , we have also studied the efficiency of edge - deleted networks in the case of @xmath85 nodes with off - diagonal disorder and dissipation in the network , as given by the following term in the master equation : @xmath87 .",
    "\\label{dissipation}\\ ] ] we have considered a large number of networks ( @xmath88 in total ) , ranging from the case where there are six connections between the nodes up to the fcn , with fixed @xmath89 for all sites , as a function of the disorder strength @xmath84 between @xmath90 . while the detailed dependence of @xmath91 on @xmath84 is complicated and depends on the topology of the network , we find that for networks for which @xmath92 is close to unity to start with , increasing @xmath84 does not have much effect , as expected . in some cases , however , there s a slight approximately linear _ decrease _ in the efficiency , up to about @xmath93 % from @xmath94 to @xmath95 . on the other hand , for networks where @xmath92 is low ( less than @xmath96 ) , there s an approximately linear increase in the efficiency up to about twice its value at zero disorder ( e.g. in the case of the fcn ) .",
    "more detailed results of these studies will be published elsewhere .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated in this work that quantum transport of an energy excitation in a symmetric network of fully connected two - state objects , described by a time reversal symmetric hamiltonian , is highly inefficient . whenever an excitation is injected into a node which is not directly connected to the sink , a wave packet travelling through closed loop paths arrives in - phase to the initial position due to the time reversal symmetry , which leads to destructive interference of the transition amplitudes at the initial site .",
    "the corresponding localization of the excitation energy wave packets inside the network is the reason for inefficiency of transport in a symmetric , fully connected network .",
    "reducing the symmetry by eliminating hopping between nodes not directly connected to the sink preserves the localized states and hence does not significantly increase the system efficiency .",
    "we show that an efficient way to improve the efficiency of energy transfer is to introduce asymmetry between the initial node and the one directly linked to the sink .",
    "the rate of energy transfer can be minimized by a nontrivial value of the hopping rate @xmath54 .",
    "we have also included dephasing to the network and shown , as expected , that the presence of a dephasing noise increases the system efficiency .",
    "the same effect can be obtained by introducing off - diagonal disorder in the hopping integral parameters between the nodes .",
    "finally , we note that we have also carried out similar calculations for the cases @xmath97 and @xmath98 to verify the conclusions presented here .",
    "our results should be useful in designing quantum networks for novel applications .",
