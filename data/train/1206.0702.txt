    "being a mechanical concept , work is easier to identify in thermodynamics than heat ; the latter is not possible to be identified with any mechanical force .",
    "therefore , one usually identifies heat by first identifying work and then subtracting the latter from the energy change @xcite in the first law .",
    "this means that different formulations of work will result in different heats .",
    "we refer the reader to the above references for an interesting history of the confusion .",
    "gislason and craig @xcite list twenty - six representative textbooks including @xcite where the pressure - volume work and heat are defined so differently that they are not equivalent in the presence of irreversibility , and there appears to be no consensus about their right formulation so far ; see the recent debate in the field @xcite .",

    "the attempt to define heat by first defining work leaves the concept of heat devoid of clear physical significance , especially since it depends on what we mean by work . in many cases ,",
    "work is identified by considering the work performed by bodies external to the system ( the medium ; see fig .",
    "[ fig_system ] ) , which may have nothing to do with the work done by the system , especially when we consider irreversible processes .",
    "this has created a lot of confusion in the literature when dealing with irreversible processes ; see refs .",
    "@xcite for a recent discussion ; see also @xcite .",
    "the traditional formulation of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics @xcite follows a mechanistic approach in which the system of interest , to be precise its microstate , follows its ( classical or quantum ) mechanical evolution in time .",
    "the only difference between mechanics and thermodynamics is that the evolution in thermodynamics is _ always _ stochastic , which makes the evolution irreversible in accordance with the second law ; see for example a recent review @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to consider a _ statistical foundation _ of nonequilibrium thermodynamics for a better understanding of heat and work , a project we have also initiated recently @xcite .",
    "the concept of work follows in a trivial manner by taking ( a _ stochastic average _ of ) its mechanical analog ( work done by generalized forces in the hamiltonian formulation ) @xcite . and",
    "was shown to be given by @xmath33 for the pressure work ; see ref .",
    "these forces can be controlled by an observer and determine the _ observables _ in the system ; see for example @xcite .",

    "however , the interpretation of the above new formulation , its statistical basis , and its realtionship with the traditional formulation @xmath36 in terms of exchange heat @xmath37 and work @xmath28 was not explored in earlier publications @xcite .    for an isolated system , the mechanical observables , collectively denoted by the set @xmath38 , are additive integrals of motion @xcite such as the energy @xmath39 , the number of particles @xmath40 of different species , and linear and angular momenta @xmath41  and @xmath42 of the system , respectively , whose values depend on the preparation of the system .",
    "when the motion is confined to a finite region of space , the volume @xmath43 of this region also characterizes the system as a constraint .",
    "the _ constraints _ are also treated as observables.the internal variables unfortunately can not be controlled by an observer . despite this",
    ", the concept of work needs to incorporate the additional work required in changing the internal variables .",
    "this gives rise to some complication in identifying the form of work associated with them .",
    "the collection of observables and internal variables will be called _ state variables _ and will be denoted by the set @xmath44 .",
    "the macrostate can be characterized in a larger state space of @xmath44 , even though the observed macrostate is characterized by @xmath38 .",
    "the internal variables do not remain constant for an isolated system as the system relaxes . in this sense",
    ", we must treat the isolated system as interacting with an appropriate `` fictitious '' medium to allow for the variation of internal variables , a fact not emphasized in the literature to the best of our knowledge ; see ref .",
    "as both energy and work are mechanical concepts , it is trivial to identify their statistical averages over microstates whether the system is in or out of equilibrium .",
    "as the concept of heat has no analog in mechanics , it is usually identified indirectly as that energy change which is _ not _ work .",
    "_ this kind of approach makes heat and work not unique _ : a change in one affects the other ; only their difference has a well - defined meaning .",
    "this has created a lot of confusion in the field .",
    "our goal in this work is to establish that there exists a consistent procedure in which the partition is _",
    "unique _ so that work and heat are no longer arbitrary in irreversible processes .",
    "they are given by generaized work and heat despite the controversy .",
    "the first law of thermodynamics , see for example , refs .",
    "@xcite , is a very general statement and is supposed to be valid for all processes , and not just equilibrium processes",
    ". the traditional formulation of the first law in terms of the _ exchange heat and work _ is not only oblivious to the internal variables and thermodynamic forces , whose presence must control the approach to equilibrium , but most significantly , is also oblivious to the violation of the second law ; see below .",
    "this is why we need to use both the first and the second laws in nonequilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "how can a formulation of a fundamental law of physics allow for the violation of another fundamental law of physics ?",
    "there is also an asymmetry between heat and work that will be elaborated below in that the two terms are not on an equal footing .",
    "there is obviously no problem for reversible processes .",
    "we mostly consider mechanical work including dissipation , but the arguments are valid for all kinds of work ; see sec .",
    "[ sect_other_state_variables ] , however .",
    "zemansky @xcite defines heat as energy exchange `` ... by virtue of a temperature difference only . ''",
    "unfortunately , this rules out any isothermal heat exchange and can not be considered general .",
    "kirkwood and oppenheim define heat as energy exchange resulting in `` ... the temperature increment ... '' ( which rules out phase changes requiring latent heat ) and later note that the work may be converted to heat due to frictional dissipation @xcite as was first observed by count rumford in 1798 during the boring of cannon @xcite .",
    "these are two of the examples where heat is defined directly without first identifying work ; they have limitations and can not be considered general , especially when irreversibility is present . the situation with work",
    "is just as confusing as we noted above with its two different formulations : @xmath28  or @xmath45 .",
    "dissipation always gives rise to positive entropy generation due to irreversibility and also raises the temperature such as due to friction or the joule heat in resistors .",
    "therefore , it is natural to account for such viscous dissipation in work and heat when dealing with nonequilibrium systems , as they are integral to the system and dictate its relaxation .",
    "the fact that literature is not very clear on how to incorporate viscous dissipation has motivated this work ; see however @xcite , but the authors do not take the discussion far enough to obtain the results derived here .",
    "recently , dissipative forces are explicitly considered in stochastic trajectory thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "however , the approach differs from our approach @xcite in important ways and has also given rise to controversy , and remains contentious @xcite .",
    "in addition , the approach is not general as it is limited to isothermal variations and to cases where langevin dynamics is applicable ; see , however , hoover and hoover @xcite where an example of a time - reversible deterministic hamiltonian system is given .",
    "we interpret heat and work used in the recent reformulation in eq .",
    "( [ first_law ] ) that was proposed in refs . @xcite and follow the consequences with an aim to develop their statistical definition .",
    "the formulation makes the first law identical to the second law ( in the guise of the gibbs fundamental relation ) in general , @xmath46 but @xmath47  and @xmath5  are not related to each other , except in internal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "moreover , it would be incorrect to conclude from @xmath48 that @xmath49 ;  see later .",
    "the aim of any theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics is to determine the entropy change @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , the determination of @xmath18 becomes the focus in any investigation of a body in the traditional formulation .",
    "the second law is reflected in the inequality @xmath27 for any irreversible process .",
    "the statistical analysis provides an elegant formulation of nonequilibrium thermodynamics in which there is a _",
    "unique _ and _ natural _ distinction between nonequilibrium work and heat in that the generalized work represents _ isentropic change in the ( internal ) energy _ and the generalized heat represents the _ isometric _ ( constant extensive state variables excluding the energy ) change in the energy . the latter change _",
    "_ results purely from the entropy change .",
    "the unique partition of energy remains valid no matter how far the system is out of equilibrium .",
    "the assumption of _ internal equilibrium _ allows us to express the first law in terms of the _ instantaneous _ ( or internal ) fields .",
    "this brings about a very close parallel between nonequilibrium and equilibrium processes such as @xmath50  and the existence of a theorem for irreversible processes identical in spirit to the _ adiabtic theorem _ @xcite for equilibrium processes .  the approach proposed recently in refs .",
    "@xcite deals directly with @xmath47 without a need to use @xmath51 and @xmath18 separately , although they can also be evaluated in our approach",
    ". therefore , our approach should be quite useful as the entropy is a state variable ; see below , however , for other advantages .",
    "a particular symmetry is explicitly seen in our formulation in that both @xmath52 and @xmath53  not only do not change with the nature of the process but also exhibit an identical formulation in terms of entropy and volume , respectively . in other words , they are found to be on an equal footing .  as a consequence ,",
    "the first law becomes identical to the second law ( as the gibbs fundamental relation ) so we only deal with a single law .",
    "the clausius inequality @xcite turns into an equality in _ all _ cases as @xmath54 becomes a state variable , the work is expresssed as an equality , as if we are dealing with equilibrium processes , a quite remarkable result in its own right , even though there is irreversible entropy generation .",
    "it has been recently suggested @xcite that the use of internal fields is not always consistent with the second law .",
    "we find no such problem in our approach .",
    "[ ptb ]    system_modified_1.eps    the new formulation of the first law contains not only the observables and the instantaneous fields of the system but also explicitly contains internal variables so no information about the system is lost .",
    "this makes the new formulation quite beneficial . the instantaneous temperature , pressure , etc . of the system",
    "need not be identical to those of the medium when the system is out of equilibrium with the medium as has become clear recently @xcite .",
    "thus , our approach also overcomes the objection raised by cohen and mauzerall @xcite against the stochastic trajectory thermodynamics @xcite to which our approach is easily extended .",
    "we will establish that there are several benefits in accounting for viscous dissipation within the system in the first law , but care must be exercised .",
    "our approach , which _ assumes _ the existence of entropy even for nonequilibrium states @xcite as was first proposed by clausius @xcite , is otherwise very general as we do not restrict ourselves to any particular dynamics and to only isothermal variations .",
    "it allows us to incorporate viscous dissipation , due to the presence of thermodynamic forces and internal variables , in the discussion explicitly within this general framework .",
    "we consider our system @xmath55 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_system ] ) surrounded by a very large medium @xmath56 so large that its fields such as its temperature @xmath57 , pressure @xmath30 , etc .",

    "differences across it .",
    "because of the enormous size of the medium with respect to that of the system , all irreversible components in @xmath59  appear within @xmath55 ( @xmath60 ) although this is not always so in the literature @xcite .",

    "to truly appreciate our contribution , it is useful to consider how the first law is traditionally expressed .",
    "we will only consider a single internal variable @xmath65 for simplicity .",
    "similarly , we will consider only @xmath39 and @xmath43 for simplicity as observables with the number of particles @xmath66 ( only a single species ) held fixed , unless noted otherwise .",
    "other variables are easy to include in the approach as we do in sec .",
    "[ sect_other_state_variables ] .",
    "traditionally , @xmath5 represents the amount of heat exchange @xmath10 , so that @xmath67is identified with the work exchange @xmath68 by the medium to the system , giving @xmath28 .",
    "this is true even if the system can not be assigned any pressure or if its _ instantaneous _ pressure @xmath31 is different from @xmath30 . as the net heat exchange @xmath69",

    "landau and lifshitz are explicit and state that @xmath45 for reversible and irreversible processes @xcite .",
    "they require for this the _ existence _ of mechanical equilibrium ( and so do refs .",

    "@xmath55 , then this will alter the heat @xmath5 _ added to _ @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ first_law ] ) .",
    "this follows immediately from the fact , not appreciated in the literature to the best of our knowledge , that @xmath9 must be _ invariant _ to the choice of internal or external fields . also , to the best of our knowledge , the issue of the actual forms of @xmath5 and what is the correct form of @xmath6 for nonequilibrium processes has not been settled in the literature",
    "indeed , kestin ( * ? ? ?",

    "the exchange heat and work @xmath10 and @xmath83  are very different  for irreversible processes , since @xmath84 is in terms of @xmath51 , which is not the change in a state variable , while @xmath28 depends on the change in a state variable .",
    "thus , there is an _",
    "asymmetry _ between the two in the second equation in eq .",
    "( [ standard_heat_sum ] ) in that they are not on an equal footing . however , the main disadvantage of the formulation is that it is always valid , even for a process that violates the second law by having the exchange heat flow from a colder to a hotter object .",

    "we now list some of the important limitations of the traditional formulation below .    1 .   the law is oblivious to the violation of the second law .",
    "2 .   there is the above mentioned asymmetry between heat and work .",
    "3 .   as both @xmath10 and @xmath83 are determined by the medium , their knowledge does not provide us with any _ direct _ information about the system or its entropy change @xmath86 in an irreversible process .",
    "this is easily seen by considering an isolated body . as @xmath87",
    ", the first law has no useful content .",
    "moreover , it can not be used to determine @xmath88 as the body changes from some state a@xmath89 to a nearby state a unless both states are equilibrium states . in the latter case",

    "this approach will not work if one of the two states is or both are out of equilibrium .",
