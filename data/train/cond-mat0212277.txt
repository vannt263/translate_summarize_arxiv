    "no theoretical prediction exists for the validity of dynamic finite - size scaling along the lambda line of @xmath3he . here",
    "we present some results of the first renormalization - group calculation of finite - size effects on the thermal conductivity of @xmath3he above and at @xmath2 and compare our results with experimental data by kahn and ahlers @xcite .",
    "our calculations are based on model f @xcite which is defined by    @xmath4    @xmath5    @xmath6    where    @xmath7    @xmath8    we consider a rectangular @xmath9 box geometry and assume a stationary heat current _ q _ in the _ z _ direction which is generated by a heat source in the bottom plane @xmath10 and absorbed by a sink in the top plane @xmath11 ,    @xmath12 \\;.\\ ] ]    we impose dirichlet boundary conditions for the order parameter ( @xmath13 ) and neumann boundary conditions for the entropy density @xmath14 ( vanishing spatial derivatives perpendicular to the sidewalls )",
