    "the purpose of this paper is to evaluate nucleon mass corrections to the rate of weak transitions that interconvert neutrons and protons during the early stages of big bang nucleosynthesis@xcite . in the usual calculation of these rates",
    "the nucleon mass is ignored ; one includes all energies and momenta in the  range , specifically , ratios of the electron mass , @xmath8 , the temperature , @xmath9 , and the neutron - proton mass difference , @xmath10 ; but factors such as @xmath11 , , a low energy scale divided by a nucleon mass , are ignored .",
    "these factors are individually of order a tenth of a percent , but it will be shown that together they cause roughly a 0.5% increase in the helium abundance predicted by big bang nucleosynthesis calculations .",
    "such a systematic correction is significant in that it is comparable to the largest uncertainty in the standard hot big bang calculation - that due to uncertainty in the neutron half life .",
    "further , the increase in the predicted helium abundance translates into a tighter constraint on the density of baryons as well as a strengthening of particle constraints based on big bang nucleosynthesis - such as the limit on the number of neutrino species that may be in thermal equilibrium in the early universe .    as an example of the sort of effect that is usually ignored , consider the neutron to proton abundance ratio in thermal equilibrium .",
    "including the first correction in an expansion in inverse powers of @xmath12 this ratio is usually one includes just the ` boltzman factor ' and ignores the correction , which is small , @xmath13 .",
    "thus , even if freeze out of the weak reactions occurred at the same time , one might expect the neutron abundance to be slightly higher if nucleon mass corrections were included .    of course , it is essential that the neutron fraction drops out of thermal equilibrium as the weak reactions become slow compared to the expansion rate of the universe , and so one does not calculate the neutron abundance by equilibrium arguments in a numerical calculation . instead one evaluates the rates for @xmath14 conversions and tracks carefully the maintenance of approximate equilibrium at high temperatures and the failure to maintain equilibrium at low temperatures .",
    "it is , therefore , necessary to evaluate the change in the rates - not just the equilibrium neutron fraction .",
    "there are many @xmath15 corrections to the @xmath14 rates and it is the purpose of this paper to enumerate and evaluate them in a systematic fashion .",
    "the spirit of this paper is similar to those which evaluated the electromagnetic radiative , thermal , and coulomb corrections to the @xmath14 processes@xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the corrections are a few percent at most . to achieve a satisfactory level of accuracy , one part in a thousand ,",
    "it is necessary to evaluate only the first correction , but not effects of order @xmath16 or , in the electromagnetic case , of order @xmath17 . nor is it necessary to consider terms of order @xmath18 .",
    "another similarity in the two problems concerns the normalization of the corrections .",
    "the nucleosynthesis numerical codes typically normalize the weak rates to the experimental value of the neutron mean lifetime , @xmath19 .",
    "thus , when evaluating a purported correction to the rates one must also evaluate the same sort of corrections for neutron decay , and adjust the corrections appropriate for bbn accordingly .",
    "so , for example , the largest term in the order @xmath20 radiative correction to the weak rates is a constant which also shows up in neutron decay .",
    "similarly , a good part of the coulomb correction to the weak rates also cancels .",
    "thus , the early numerical code of wagoner@xcite contained a simple coulomb correction and no radiative correction , but although individual reactions have corrections of @xmath21 , the net effect of a more detailed treatment results in less than a 1% correction to wagoner s results .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath15 corrections are of order 1% to the reaction rates , but the comparable correction to neutron decay is smaller due to kinematic thresholds . as a result ,",
    "nearly the whole of the effects discussed here survive to affect the helium abundance .    with these thoughts in mind the rest of the paper is ordered as follows . in section 2 , the main results are presented - the corrections to the @xmath14 rates to first order in @xmath15 . in section 3 ,",
    "similar effects are considered for neutron decay .",
    "section 4 combines the results from the previous two sections to arrive at an expected change in the helium abundance .",
    "section 5 contains a discussion of the significance of the results .",
    "first , however , it may be useful to the reader to clarify some of the notation used later .",
    "except where the neutron or proton mass is explicitly indicated by @xmath22 or @xmath23 , the nucleon mass is given as @xmath12 . in the formulae for cross - sections , rates , , @xmath12 refers to the initial nucleon mass , but to the extent that the formulae are only accurate to @xmath15 it makes no difference which nucleon mass is actually used . also , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the energy and momentum of the initial lepton in the rest frame of the fluid .",
    "unless specifically noted , the energy @xmath26 denotes the quantity @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "this is only equal to the outgoing lepton energy in the infinite mass limit , @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 is the corresponding momentum , @xmath31 . during nucleosynthesis the temperature describing the neutrino distribution , @xmath32 ,",
    "is not equal to the temperature of the rest of the plasma ( including the nucleons ) , denoted by @xmath33 .",
    "when the temperature @xmath34 is used , it refers to the temperature which describes the outgoing lepton .",
    "there are six processes that contribute to @xmath14 conversion in the early universe ; neutron decay @xmath35 , inverse neutron decay @xmath36 , and four scattering processes , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the most critical time is when these reactions are ` freezing out ' , , when they are just failing to maintain thermal equilibrium .",
    "this occurs at a temperature @xmath39 . at that time",
    "the scattering processes dominate over neutron decay and inverse decay by a factor of about 1000 .",
    "the reactions which convert neutrons to protons are some 6 times greater than the inverse reactions , due to the nuclear mass difference affecting phase space .",
    "the reactions involving antileptons are nearly equal in importance to those involving leptons . to achieve an accuracy of 0.1% it therefore seems sufficient to consider just corrections to the scattering rates ; however , because of the role played by neutron decay in normalizing the weak rates those corrections must also be examined .",
    "accordingly , this section presents corrections to scattering and the next examines neutron decay .",
    "the rate for two body scattering reactions in a medium may be written in the form where @xmath40 is the four momentum , @xmath41 is the three momentum , @xmath42 is the energy of each particle , and for the problem at hand all particles obey fermi statistics .",
    "the occupation numbers @xmath43 take thermal equilibrium values only for those species actually in equilibrium . in this notation",
    "the squared matrix element , @xmath44 , has been summed over all spin degrees of freedom and it is assumed that the @xmath43 do not depend on spin . the presence or absence of right - handed neutrinos is irrelevant for the evaluation of the scattering rates . for the reactions of interest , let particles 2 and 4 be the in and out nucleons , respectively , and let particles 1 and 3 be the leptons or anti - leptons .      before going into the details of nucleon mass corrections",
    "it is appropriate to evaluate the reaction rates in the limit of infinite nucleon mass . in this limit",
    "the energies of the in and out leptons are related by @xmath45 , where @xmath28 depending on whether a neutron or proton is the initial nucleon .",
    "further , neither lepton occupation number will depend upon the scattering angles .",
    "the rate can then be rewritten in the familiar form where @xmath46 is the cross - section for the reaction summed over both initial and final spins and @xmath47 is the relative velocity of the two initial particles , which for infinite mass nucleons may be taken to be just the initial lepton velocity , @xmath48 .",
    "it is useful to concentrate on the rate per initial state in the absence of blocking , @xmath49 . for infinite mass nucleons ,",
    "this quantity becomes where @xmath50 is the cross - section for a lepton of energy @xmath24 incident on an infinitely heavy nucleon , @xmath51 is fermi s constant , @xmath52 is the cabibbo angle , with @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the ratio of the axial vector to vector coupling of the nucleon for charged currents .",
    "the last relation in serves as a definition of the constant @xmath55 , a factor which will be common to all the weak reactions .",
    "the coulomb and radiative corrections to the rates are embodied in an electromagnetic correction factor @xmath56 ; however , as explained in the introduction , all corrections to the weak rates are small and may be treated independently .",
    "it is therefore acceptable to ignore @xmath57 except when worrying about the overall normalization of the rates , and so the factor @xmath57 will be dropped .    for heavy nucleons , low baryon density and low lepton asymmetry",
    ", it is appropriate to approximate @xmath58 by a boltzman distribution and ignore @xmath59 entirely . integrating over nucleon momentum and lepton direction",
    ", converting the lepton momentum integral to one over energy , and using thermal distributions for the leptons one gets the rate , where @xmath60 is the spatial density of initial nucleons , and @xmath61 is the temperature describing lepton @xmath62 . defines the differential interaction rate @xmath63 , which is plotted in for each of the four scattering processes .",
    "the plots were generated using temperatures @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "this is near the conventional `` freezeout temperature '' ,  that temperature where the equilibrium abundances are equal to the final values , as if the interactions were very rapid and then turned off abruptly . the freezeout point is high enough that electron annihilation has caused the photon temperature to increase by only a small amount over the neutrino temperature .",
    "note that the @xmath66 rates in are some 6 times greater than the @xmath67 rates , as required to maintain equilibrium at this temperature .    to give a better feel for the important points in determining the neutron fraction , shows the integrated scattering rates , @xmath68 , for the four scattering processes as a function of the photon temperature , @xmath33 .",
    "the expansion rate , @xmath69 , is also shown ; along with the free neutron decay rate .",
    "the @xmath67 reactions freezeout first , and become increasingly unimportant at lower temperatures .",
    "the @xmath66 scattering rates freeze out later .",
    "they are more important than free neutron decay down to a temperature @xmath70 , but what really counts is the comparison to @xmath71 .",
    "after @xmath72 the most significant comparison to @xmath71 is free neutron decay just at the time the `` deuterium bottleneck '' breaks , at which time @xmath73 .",
    "corrections to the scattering rates for @xmath74 are not very important .",
    "apart from electromagnetic corrections , is the reaction rate used in nucleosynthesis calculations .",
    "there are several points where infinite mass nucleons were used . merely writing the reaction in the form of a cross - section required that the final state occupation numbers did not depend on the scattering angles , and this depends on the assumption that no recoil energy goes to the nucleon .",
    "the vector and axial vector cross - section , , has corrections of order @xmath15 .",
    "in addition , the vector and axial vector lagrangian must be corrected for nucleon structure effects , such as momentum dependent form factors , or new terms in the effective low energy effective lagrangian , such as ` weak magnetism ' .",
    "the relative velocity , @xmath47 , must be corrected for the nucleon velocity .",
    "one must average over the boltzman distribution , @xmath58 , to produce a ` thermal averaged ' cross - section @xmath75 relative velocity @xmath75 blocking effects due to the fermi statistics .",
    "since the nucleon velocity @xmath76 is of order @xmath77 one must expand in the nuclear velocity to second order to get corrections to first order in the nucleon mass .",
    "one implication of this is that there may be correlations between corrections that are first order in @xmath78 .",
    "although first order terms vanish when angle averaged their correlations may not , and can therefore contribute at first order in @xmath15 .    as presented here , these calculations are done by evaluating corrections to the rates , @xmath79 , and the blocking factors @xmath80 , as a function of the initial lepton energy . after taking appropriate angular combinations ,",
    "the corrections are integrated over lepton energy to produce corrections to the conversion rates per nucleon , which may be used in the rate equations to solve for the neutron abundance as a function of time .",
    "the most obvious corrections to consider are @xmath15 corrections to the cross - section , which are combined with the zeroth order , or infinite nucleon mass , values for @xmath47 and @xmath81 .",
    "the @xmath15 corrections to @xmath46 will be calculated in section 2.2 . when the nucleon velocity is taken into account",
    "there will be corrections to @xmath46 due to the altered lepton energy , as well as corrections intrinsic to @xmath47 .",
    "these are evaluated in section 2.3 along with the corrections to the blocking factors .",
    "these corrections and their correlations will be expressed as effective corrections to the rate @xmath82 , which can be multiplied by the zeroth order @xmath47 and @xmath81 .    as a preliminary to this ,",
    "consider the differential cross - section to order @xmath15 , the zeroth order total cross - section , @xmath50 , is given by .",
    "the @xmath15 correction to the total cross - section is @xmath83 .",
    "the relevant angular dependence of the differential cross - section is given by @xmath84 , which is to be multiplied by @xmath85 with @xmath20 being the center of mass scattering angle .",
    "terms higher order in @xmath85 are suppressed by two powers of @xmath12 ( or powers of @xmath86 ) and may be dropped .",
    "if there were no corrections to the blocking factors for the final state leptons @xmath84 would integrate to zero when averaged over scattering angle ; however , there are corrections to the blocking factors .",
    "since these are suppressed by factors of @xmath12 one need only keep the zeroth order term of @xmath84 , discussion of the corrections to the rates due to @xmath84 is postponed till later , after evaluating the corrections to the lepton blocking factors in section 2.3 .",
    "there are two important corrections in @xmath83 , one that arises from including the weak magnetism term in the interaction , and one that arises from modifications to the final state phase space due to the recoil of the nucleon .",
    "they may be treated independently to first order in @xmath12 .",
    "the effective low energy weak lagrangian is , where the leptonic current has the usual @xmath87 structure and the hadronic weak current is given by where @xmath88 is the anomalous weak charged current magnetic moment of the nucleon , @xmath89 is the pseudoscalar coupling to the nucleon , and @xmath90 is the momentum transfer to the nucleon . at higher energies , one would treat the couplings @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath89 as form factors with corrections of order @xmath94 , where the @xmath95 differ for the different interactions and are experimentally determined to be in the range @xmath96 .",
    "thus , the form factor corrections may reasonably be assumed to be higher order than the @xmath15 corrections considered in this paper .",
    "the full squared matrix element for scattering with the current in is given in appendix a , but here only the relevant terms are kept . the pseudoscalar coupling is usually approximated by the pion pole term . at low momentum transfer",
    "this leads to a suppression of the amplitude by a factor of @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the @xmath99-nucleon coupling and @xmath100 is the pion decay constant .",
    "since this is small it is dropped from further discussion .",
    "weak magnetism is generated by the @xmath93 term .",
    "there is an explicit factor of @xmath15 in the coupling , so one may ignore the square of the weak magnetism term , but there may be interference between weak magnetism and the vector and axial vector interactions .",
    "the interference with the vector interaction vanishes at order @xmath15 , which leaves just a correction proportional to @xmath101 , where the zeroth order @xmath47 is acceptable since there is already one power of @xmath15 in the correction @xmath102 .",
    "next , consider the @xmath15 corrections to the usual @xmath103 plus @xmath55 interactions .",
    "these will be referred to collectively as the ` recoil ' correction , since a major component of the correction may be understood as a reduction in the phase space for the outgoing lepton due to the energy carried off by the nucleon .",
    "the correction is calculated in the frame of the target nucleon by 1 ) expressing the differential cross - section in terms of the invariants @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and the particle masses , 2 ) expressing @xmath104 and @xmath105 in terms of the incident lepton energy , 3 ) integrating over phase space , and 4 ) extracting all terms to the required power of @xmath15 .",
    "one must keep the full expression for @xmath104 , @xmath106 , since the leading part of @xmath104 cancels in some parts of the calculation .",
    "the invariant @xmath105 may be written as @xmath107 , where to first order in @xmath15 integrating over @xmath108 , keeping just the term proportional to @xmath12 , and applying the appropriate normalization yields note that the interference between the @xmath55 and @xmath103 currents has exactly the same structure as that between the axial vector and weak magnetism interactions .",
    "for the remaining corrections one must perform averages over scattering angle and/or thermal averages over the nucleon momentum .",
    "the strategy presented here is to evaluate these corrections separately for the lepton blocking factor @xmath81 , and for the product @xmath109 .",
    "each is developed as a power series in the cosines of the scattering angle @xmath20 and of the incident angle of the initial lepton momentum relative to the nucleon momentum , labeled by @xmath110 .",
    "it is only necessary to include terms up to @xmath111 , since each factor of @xmath112 comes accompanied by the nucleon velocity , which is of order @xmath113 .",
    "further , terms first order in @xmath112 and @xmath85 integrate to zero and may be dropped , although only after the two series are multiplied together to pick up the angular correlations between the corrections to @xmath109 and @xmath81 .",
    "the thermal averaged @xmath109 for a lepton of energy @xmath24 is given by can be used for @xmath109 with just two changes .",
    "first , one must use the lepton energy in the nucleon rest frame , where here @xmath114 is the relativistic @xmath115 factor for the initial nucleon .",
    "second , @xmath109 must be multiplied by a factor to account for the change in lepton flux seen in the nucleon rest frame . the thermal average is then done by expanding in powers of @xmath76 and replacing @xmath116 by its thermal average , @xmath117 . this procedure is totally equivalent to the more standard practice of using the lorentz invariant cross - section with @xmath118 and using the lorentz invariant flux factor however , a difficulty arises in the use of .",
    "when @xmath47 is expanded in terms of @xmath76 terms of order @xmath119 are generated , but there is a region of phase space where the lepton velocity is small compared to @xmath76 , and this expansion is not valid . using the rest frame @xmath109 and avoids this problem for the incident lepton velocity .",
    "the result of performing the thermal average is an effective correction to @xmath109 for incident lepton energy @xmath24 , the last term in presents a problem akin to that just discussed concerning @xmath47 ; namely , when the reaction energy is near threshold the final state lepton velocity will be small if that lepton is massive ,  it is an electron or positron .",
    "this is not a problem for the reaction @xmath120 since the positive @xmath121 value always keeps the electron energy well above threshold , but it is a problem for @xmath122 .",
    "it is also not a difficulty for reactions with final state neutrinos since then @xmath123 .",
    "the anomalous powers of @xmath30 are symptomatic of a deeper problem with the thermal averaging .",
    "the averaging procedure adopted here is only valid when the change in outgoing lepton momentum due to nuclear mass effects is small compared to its value when the nucleon mass is taken to infinity .",
    "this is not true near threshold@xcite , where @xmath124 .",
    "as an example , consider an incident lepton whose energy is the threshold energy for a nucleon at rest .",
    "then , for those nucleons moving with @xmath125 the effective reaction energy is above threshold .",
    "thus , after thermal averaging , the threshold should no longer be sharp .",
    "fortunately , the reaction rates are not dominated by the behavior near threshold , since phase space vanishes there .",
    "the error introduced by the adopted procedure seems to be acceptably small , as will be discussed later .",
    "now consider the lepton blocking factor @xmath81 .",
    "assuming that the leptons are in thermal equilibrium ( see dodelson and turner for a discussion of this point ) the blocking factor is where @xmath126 is the true energy of the outgoing lepton .",
    "the factor @xmath81 depends only on the energy of the outgoing lepton .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath127 is a function of both the scattering angles and the relative motion of the initial lepton and nucleon , so an integration over all of phase space is unavoidable .",
    "the relevant corrections to the blocking factor are derived in appendix b and given in .",
    "there are four corrections , organized by factors of @xmath85 and @xmath112 , that constitute the blocking factor up to order @xmath15 .",
    "the corrections are normalized by @xmath128 , the zeroth order term , so that the full blocking factor is @xmath129 is first order in @xmath15 and should be combined only with the zeroth order part of @xmath109 to produce an effective correction to the cross - section which generates a correction to the rate when integrated over incident lepton energy .",
    "the next term @xmath130 is of order @xmath131 and proportional to @xmath112 .",
    "when combined with the @xmath112 correction to @xmath109 due to thermal averaging , an effective @xmath15 correction is produced finally there are two pieces that are proportional to @xmath85 , which must be combined with the @xmath85 dependent part of the differential cross - section , @xmath84 .",
    "the first piece , @xmath132 is proportional to @xmath133 and must be combined with only the @xmath112 part of @xmath134 to yield a correction the second piece , @xmath135 is angle independent but of order @xmath15 and is combined only with the leading piece of @xmath84 to yield a second correction in the following section , these two terms are combined to form a single correction , @xmath136 .      in the previous two sections",
    "six corrections to the weak @xmath14 rates that are formerly of order @xmath15 were identified : @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath136 ; which should be combined with @xmath128 and integrated over @xmath24 to produce corrections to the rates .",
    "shows a plot of @xmath142 for each of the six corrections to the reaction @xmath120 , at @xmath143 .",
    "first , consider the three small terms @xmath141 , @xmath140 , and @xmath136 , which have all been exagerated by a factor of 100 in the figure .",
    "clearly , these three terms are much smaller than the other three .",
    "the main reason for this is easy to understand . due to the @xmath144 dependence of the cross - section and powers of @xmath145 in phase space ,",
    "the rates are dominated by leptons with @xmath146 . at this point",
    "the blocking factors are small , and corrections to them are even smaller .",
    "this can be seen explicitly in appendix b , where it is shown that each correction to @xmath81 carries at least one extra factor of @xmath147 .",
    "in addition , the proliferation of terms in the expansions leading to @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 is greater than for the terms associated with the blocking factors .",
    "a third factor suppresses @xmath136 , namely that it is proportional to @xmath148 , which is numerically about a tenth of @xmath149 which comes into the thermal corrections .",
    "for all these reasons , the three small corrections are dropped from most of the discussion that follows .",
    "now turn to the three larger corrections , beginning with that for weak magnetism .",
    "shows @xmath137 weighted by phase space considerations to produce a differential interaction rate per baryon , @xmath150 , that can be found by substituting @xmath137 for @xmath82 in . the scale for this graph",
    "should be compared to .",
    "the corrections to each reaction are of order 1% at @xmath64 , but apart from small contributions near thresholds one can see that there is an almost exact cancellation between the lepton reactions ( @xmath120 and @xmath151 ) and the anti - lepton interactions ( @xmath38 and @xmath122 ) .",
    "this is due to an effective change in sign for the value of @xmath152 when considering leptonic and antileptonic scattering , , the anti - leptonic current is right handed .",
    "thus , although the corrections are large for each of the individual reactions , the net effect on nucleosynthesis due to weak magnetism is fairly small .",
    "it is not , however , totally negligible .",
    "there are differences in the phase space details for the different channels , and the neutrino temperature is in fact less than the electron temperature . as a result , when the photon temperature is @xmath153 the @xmath38 channel is slightly more important than the @xmath120 channel , and weak magnetism causes a small decrease in @xmath154 .",
    "this , in turn , causes a slight increase in @xmath155 . at cooler temperatures , the electron density drops and",
    "the @xmath38 channel becomes insignificant , but by then the @xmath120 channel is also small and the weak magnetism corrections are not important then .",
    "next , consider , which shows the correction to the differential reaction rate due to recoil effects , @xmath138 . here",
    "the sign of the effect is the same for all reactions .",
    "the final state phase space for the outgoing lepton is reduced and this causes a reduction in the cross - sections at @xmath156 of about 1% .",
    "the magnitude of the reduction increases with temperature .",
    "this can be seen by examining the @xmath138 curve in where the fractional increase in the recoil effect is seen to increase approximately linearly with energy .",
    "when weighted by a thermal distribution the fractional change in rate will increase with @xmath9 .    even though all the reactions are affected in a similar way that does not imply that there will be no effect on nucleosynthesis .",
    "since all the rates are reduced , freezeout of the neutron - proton ratio will take place a little earlier , when the neutron abundance is higher . as a result there will be more helium .",
    "further , the rates are not reduced in proportion to the zeroth order rates , so there may be a shift in @xmath157 even at high temperatures , when the rates are fast .",
    "these effects will be discussed further in section 4 .",
    "the third important correction is that due to thermal averaging over the nucleon momentum , illustrated in . here",
    "again all reactions are affected in a similar way , only now the rates are slightly increased . the increase is due to the fact that the average collision energy is slightly enhanced by the nucleon motion , and since the cross - sections increase with energy , the rates increase due to this effect .",
    "comparison of and shows that the thermal averaging effect is about 1/3 the effect due to recoil , so that the net effect of the two processes is to decrease the reaction rates .",
    "the total reduction in rate arises from integrating over initial lepton energies . shows the fractional change in rate , @xmath158 for the four scattering reactions as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "the curves include all six terms shown in .",
    "the reduction increases nearly linearly with temperature , although there are deviations at low temperatures .",
    "the linear increase is a consequence of the fact that of the three small parameters , @xmath159 , @xmath11 , and @xmath160 , the latter is by far the largest .",
    "the coefficient , 5 , reflects the increase of cross - section and phase space with initial lepton energy .",
    "another feature of is that at high temperatures the corrections to @xmath161 are either less positive or more negative than the corresponding corrections to @xmath162 .",
    "this is not unexpected since the order @xmath15 correction to the equilibrium abundance of neutrons should result in a 0.2% increase in @xmath157 , and this must be reflected by a change in the rates which maintain equilibrium . at low temperatures",
    "two things happen .",
    "first , the neutrino and photon temperatures are no longer equal , so equilibrium arguments no longer apply .",
    "second , the difficulties with the threshold behavior in the @xmath122 channel become apparent .",
    "fortunately , the threshold behavior does not become a problem until @xmath163 and by that time the absolute rate of the @xmath122 reactions is so small ( see ) that the error to the correction to @xmath155 is insignificant .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the @xmath14 rates used in big bang nucleosynthesis calculations are not usually calculated from first principles , but are normalized to the experimental lifetime for neutron decay .",
    "originally this had the advantage of partially accounting for some of the effects left out of the calculation , such as the coulomb and radiative corrections . in the present case ,",
    "this convention requires us to calculate the recoil corrections for neutron decay , since those corrections are , in effect , already included in the numerical bbn codes .",
    "write the scattering rate for one of the channels as where @xmath164 is the zeroth order scattering rate , and @xmath165 is the @xmath15 term normalized to @xmath164 .",
    "similarly , the neutron decay rate may be written as where the decay rate is approximated by the sum of zeroth and first order terms in an expansion in @xmath15 .",
    "the zeroth order scattering and neutron decay rates are related , schematically , @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is some function of temperature and the particle masses .",

    "may then be estimated in the last section the various @xmath165 were calculated , implicitly ; in this section the corresponding @xmath169 is evaluated .    for laboratory neutron decay",
    "it is only necessary to evaluate the recoil corrections - there are no thermal averages , nor any blocking factors .",
    "although weak magnetism affects the angular correlations of the decay products , its effects drop out of the total decay rate at first order because the interference term with the axial current is zero when integrated over leptonic phase space .",
    "this can be used as a check of the calculation .",
    "the decay to three bodies can be put into a form similar to that for scattering processes , where @xmath170 is identicle in form to that for the @xmath66 cross - sections but with @xmath104 evaluated for an ` initial ' lepton energy equal to minus the energy of the corresponding lepton in the decay .",
    "it is then straightforward to use @xmath171 .",
    "graphs of the corresponding differential decay spectra and corrections are shown in .",
    "one can see that weak magnetism contributes to the asymmetry but not to the total decay rate ; however , the recoil correction does reduce the decay rate , by an amount    noting that we have not included coulomb and radiative corrections , the value for the zeroth order neutron halflife is @xmath172 , while the halflife including recoil is @xmath173 . in the next section , where the rate equations are solved for @xmath155",
    ", it will be advisable to account for as much of the coulomb and radiative corrections as possible so as to isolate the corrections due to nucleon mass effects . to do this",
    "it should be adequate to adjust both the neutron decay rate and the scattering cross - sections , by a constant factor .",
    "this can be done easily by increasing the effective fermi constant by @xmath174 .",
    "wilkinson has performed a comprehensive examination of the corrections to neutron decay . in an effort to obtain a reliable accuracy at the level of one part in @xmath175",
    ", he evaluated all effects that would plausibly contribute at a level @xmath176 .",
    "these include recoil , weak magnetism , radiative , and coulomb corrections to second order as well as other small corrections ,  due to the finite size of the nucleons .",
    "specifically , his table 4 includes a recoil correction of @xmath177 .",
    "this result differs from in magnitude and sign ( ! ) , but the difference is due solely to different definitions of what is meant by the recoil correction .",
    "wilkinson writes the decay rate as where @xmath178 is a constant , and @xmath179 is the electron endpoint energy , including recoil effects .",
    "he then identifies the recoil correction as but this does not include the correction to the integral due to the change in the electron endpoint energy from @xmath121 to @xmath180 , the change due to the endpoint of integration is small since the integrand vanishes there in any event , but the decrease in the integrand by @xmath181 is significant .",
    "wilkinson includes this term in his definition of the zeroth order phase space integral , whereas in the current paper @xmath182 is included as part of the recoil correction .",
    "the current nucleosynthesis codes assume that the change in lepton energy is @xmath183 , which is the zeroth order value for the endpoint conventions used in this paper . even though wilkinson puts @xmath182 into the zeroth order phase space integral ,",
    "it _ is _ still present in his full phase space factor , correct to second order in @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , results of neutron decay based on wilkinson s work should be valid .",
    "the recoil correction to neutron decay should not be applied to neutron decay in the early universe , since the rate used in the code is the experimentally determined value .",
    "there is , however , a small thermal correction to neutron decay due to the thermal averaged time dilation factor .",
    "the neutron decay rate should be divided by a factor of @xmath184 . since neutron decay is more important at late times when @xmath185 this correction , although technically of order @xmath15",

    "the increase in @xmath186 due to these corrections is given by twice the increase in the neutron fraction , @xmath188 .    to perform the evolution , a simplified numerical model of the early universe",

    "the experimental rate for neutron decay was modified by the thermal lorentz dilation factor .",

    "the equilibrium values @xmath200 are also shown to illustrate the freezeout of the @xmath14 scatterring reactions , followed by the slower neutron decay .",

    "the correction to @xmath155 at this point is @xmath205 yielding a correction to the helium abundance of @xmath206 .",
    "it is interesting that at high temperatures the reaction rates for the model with nucleon mass corrections do not appear to reproduce the equilibrium neutron fraction , shown as the dotted curve in .",
    "the difference can be understood as being due to corrections that are second order in @xmath15 - both in the equilibrium abundance and in the rates .",

    "indeed , the residual is much smaller than the individual corrections ( typically a few percent ) for @xmath214",
    ".    at very low temperatures @xmath207 again becomes significant .",
    "the problem goes back to the poor threshold behavior of the @xmath122 reaction .",
    "this was checked by arbitrarily taking @xmath215 , which should alleviate the threshold problems , and increasing @xmath12 . in that case",

    ", @xmath207 is smaller than in the previous case as more of the terms necessary to achieve thermal equilibrium are included .",
    "the @xmath218 magnitude for case d ) is indicative of the @xmath16 nature of @xmath207 .",
    "note that it is not necessary to include the weak magnetism corrections in this analysis , since one can consistantly imagine another world where @xmath219 , and @xmath207 should still vanish to second order .",
    "the conclusion of these investigations is that the numerical accuracy of the approximations and numerical integrations is adequate for temperatures below @xmath220 .",
    "the major weakness is the poor threshold behavior , which induces errors of order the correction in the @xmath122 channel for @xmath163 .",
    "since this channel is not so important then , the numerical accuracy of the corrections presented here are estimated to be about 10% ( @xmath221 equivalent ) .",
    "there are also errors at higher temperatures since the corrections are only first order in @xmath222 , but these errors are dynamically erased by the fast reaction rates that persist down to freezeout .",
    "it would be useful to have a simple approximation for the @xmath15 corrections , since encoding the full expression into a nucleosynthesis code and performing the phase space integrals at each step would be a time consuming exercise .",
    "an approximation , linear in @xmath33 was developed , which represents averages for the two channels that enter into the forward or back reactions .",
    "as such these may be readily applied to the polynomial formulae used in wagoner s code to approximate the @xmath66 and @xmath67 reaction rates . before doing this one must separate out those pieces due to neutron decay and inverse decay and treat them on a separate footing , as in .",
    "the approximations in do not include the correction to the neutron lifetime , so this must be added in separately .",
    "the result of carrying out this procedure for the simplified model of the early universe used in this paper is shown as the dashed curve in .",
    "the solution for @xmath155 matches that derived from direct integration of the rates to better than 10% for temperatures less than @xmath223 .",
    "this is comparable to the estimated uncertainty in the calculation of the rates due to the improper treatment of the threshold effects .",
    "the parameters in were chosen by fitting the @xmath67 reactions in the temperature range @xmath224 , and the @xmath66 reactions in the range @xmath225 .",
    "these ranges cover freezeout for the different channels and avoid , for the most part , sensitivity to the threshold behavior of the rates .",
    "finally , to isolate the effects of weak magnetism , @xmath155 was calculated with a set of rates where @xmath93 was set to zero .",
    "the resulting increase in @xmath155 was @xmath226 instead of @xmath227 ; about 1/4th of the net increase in @xmath186 can be attributed to weak magnetism .",
    "the bulk of this contribution comes at @xmath228 where the @xmath38 channel is slightly more important than the @xmath120 channel because of kinematics and also because @xmath33 is slightly greater than @xmath32 .    it does nt really make sense to perform a similar calculation to try and isolate the recoil _ vs. _ the thermal averaging corrections",
    "the point of the analysis of the residual @xmath207 is that both are necessary to achieve a sensible thermodynamic result if one were to take @xmath229 .",
    "even so , including just recoil corrections to the rates , leads to a change in @xmath155 of just 0.0002 .",
    "this is somewhat surprising since the recoil corrections were larger than and of the opposite sign to the thermal averaging corrections .",
    "based on this , one might have expected the recoil corrections to give a correction to @xmath155 of order @xmath230 , which would be partly compensated by the thermal averaging corrections .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "an explanation can be found in the details of and , where the corrections can be seen to be not simply proportional to the zeroth order rates .",
    "the main point of this paper is that the primordial helium abundance predicted by big bang nucleosynthesis calculations should be increased by @xmath206 .",
    "it is difficult to attach a firm level of uncertainty to this number , but the results displayed in and the accompanying text suggest that an uncertainty of 10% should be inferred .",
    "this is a significant correction , but does not dramatically alter the conclusions that may be drawn from studies of bbn . consider the changes implied for the baryon density of the universe as inferred from nucleosythesis calculations .",
    "walker and kernan@xcite have recently analyzed the uncertainties in the big bang helium calculation , but they do not include the corrections due to nucleon mass effects . adapting their result to include the results presented here ,",
    "the primordial helium abundance for the standard cosmology with three neutrino species is where @xmath231 parameterizes the baryon density . without the @xmath15 corrections , the first coefficient would be 0.2398 , instead of 0.2410 . in , the first uncertainty represents a @xmath232 error due to uncertainties in the nuclear reaction network , of which `` 80 - 90% '' is due to uncertainty in measurements of the neutron decay rate .",
    "the second uncertainty allows for some of the smaller corrections to the weak interaction rates , for example , the deviation of the neutrino spectrum from thermal equilibrium .",
    "the nucleon mass corrections , approximately @xmath233 in @xmath186 , are equivalent to about a @xmath234 shift in the neutron decay rate , and are much larger than any other known uncertainty in calculating the weak rates .",
    "it is difficult to determine the primordial abundance of @xmath204 through direct observation due to a ) the inert nature of neutral helium , b ) chemical pollution through stellar burning , and c ) the high accuracy of the measurement required - better than 1% is desired .",
    "walker , suggest a primordial abundance in the range @xmath235 .",
    "the limits are suggestive of 95% confidence levels , but there is no statistically rigorous upper bound to the helium abundance . for the sake of argument",
    "then , take 0.24 as the upper limit and allow the uncertainty due to the neutron lifetime in to be favorable at the @xmath232 level , , allow the two uncertainties to add @xmath236 to the helium abundance was derived using a @xmath237 @xmath221 uncertainty in the neutron lifetime , where the current particle data book uncertainty is @xmath238 , so the uncertainty due to the reaction network should become @xmath239 .",
    "the corresponding decrease in the maximum allowed value of @xmath240 would decrease from 3.18 to 3.10 . ] .",
    "these constraints require @xmath241 . without the 0.0012 correction due to",
    "nucleon masses the corresponding number is @xmath242 . these numbers should be compared with the constraints derived from comparisons of observations of d , @xmath243 , and @xmath244 and bbn calculations , @xmath245",
    ".    taken at face value , a substantial portion ( but not all ) of the allowed parameter space for @xmath240 is eliminated by the nucleon mass correction ; however , one should always keep in mind the difficulties of helium observations .",
    "if the upper limit were @xmath246 there would be no significant constraint from the consideration of @xmath204 .",
    "on the other hand , the discussion in the previous paragraph was based on two separate favorable assumptions , both at the @xmath232 level : a ) allowing @xmath247 , and b ) taking the neutron lifetime to be near the lower end of the allowed range .",
    "dropping either of these assumptions from the favorable to the neutral category eliminates any allowed values of @xmath240 .",
    "another use of the primordial helium abundance is to constrain the energy density at the time of nucleosynthesis .",
    "this is often parameterized by the number of neutrino species , @xmath248 .",
    "the @xmath15 corrections are equivalent to @xmath249 neutrino species .",
    "again , belief in constraints placed on particle physics models depends upon one s faith in the helium observations .    over the years",
    ", there have been several papers written which treat recoil corrections in @xmath66 processes .",
    "in addition to the wilkinson paper on neutron decay , fayans and vogel have studied recoil and weak magnetism corrections to the @xmath122 reaction in the context of laboratory neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "the results here are in agreement with fayans for both recoil and weak magnetism . there is also agreement with vogel concerning weak magnetism .",
    "it is more difficult to compare to vogel s results for the recoil correction , since he gives the correction in terms of the final state lepton energy , whereas the results in this paper express the corrections in terms of the initial lepton energy .",
    "i know of no paper which deals with the thermal corrections or the corrections to the blocking factors that are relevant for the big bang nucleosynthesis scenario .",
    "while this work was underway i became aware of the work by kernan and walker , who were also beginning to look into the question of recoil corrections .",
    "i am indebted to them for sharing the details of their previous work and thoughts about the issues presented here .",

    "in this appendix , the corrections to the final state blocking factor , @xmath81 are derived . the corrections can be put into four categories based on their angular dependences , which also determines how they will be combined with various corrections to @xmath109 .",

    "further , @xmath274 , so all terms of order @xmath275 , or @xmath276 may be dropped .",
