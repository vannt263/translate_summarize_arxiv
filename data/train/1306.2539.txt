    "long - term studies of the spitsbergen western coast glaciers reveal that they are retreating over the last decades @xcite .",
    "quantification of current mass - balance trends of these glaciers is attempted by the evaluation of surface conditions ( accumulation and ablation ) , basal conditions ( melting or freezing ) and ice dynamics ( mass movements ) .",
    "surface changes can be evaluated from digital elevation models ( dems ) derived , e.g. from photogrametric methods applied on aerial and satellite images , surface gps measurements or airborne lidar acquisitions or ground based high resolution photography @xcite in addition to _ in situ _ ablation stake network height measurements .",
    "however , the glacier volume estimate is necessary for either ice dynamical modelling or future mass balance scenarios .",
    "ground - penetrating radar ( gpr ) is a geophysical tool using radiofrequency electromagnetic waves for sounding underground features .",
    "this method is especially efficient for mapping glaciers thanks to the good penetration depth of the electromagnetic waves in a low loss medium such as ice .",
    "common - offset radar profiling has been successfully used for evaluating ice thickness of glaciers ( e.g. @xcite ) , deriving at a decimetric scale the internal geometry of ice structures @xcite , locating and characterizing englacial channels  @xcite and analyzing the glacier base for determining the thermal regime @xcite .",
    "multi - offset profiles are acquired for getting a wave velocity estimate or the water content variations of the glacier ice  @xcite .",
    "it is striking to see the evolution in the radar surveys since the 1990s when measurement positioning was achieved using compass and visual navigation on the glacier and the main source of error in the ice thickness estimation was considered to be @xmath3 10 m mostly due to the digitizing of the profiles  @xcite .",

    "the mean annual precipitation is 391  mm and its mean annual temperature from 1969 to 1998 is -5.77@xmath1c ( source dnmi at http://eklima.met.no ) .",
    "thanks to the geological configuration of its basin , all runoff water is concentrated into two channels . with this specific hydrological configuration and being near the former mining town of ny - lesund , this site has been the focus of intense scrutiny since the 1960s . a summary of historical dataset since 1962 , used for elevation models on this glacier as well as their relevance to evaluate mass balance is described in @xcite .",
    "the neighboring glacier , midtre lovnbreen , has been extensively studied as well .",
    "it is known to be polythermal on the basis of radio echo sounding  @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of its structure and dynamics can be found in @xcite . additionally to a high frequency gpr survey , a seismic reflection survey allowed for determining the properties of the bed material  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present results of a high density coverage gpr survey ( 120 profiles resulting in 67542 ice thickness measurements ) of the austre lovnbreen .",
    "we first show some internal structures observed on selected radargrams , then present the ice volume estimation and finally the glacier substratum topography .",
    "we discuss the different sources of uncertainties in those two data sets .",
    "we used a mal  ramac gpr operating at 50 and 100 mhz to collect more than 70  km of mono - offset profiles ( fig .",
    "[ prof - location ] ) over the surface of the austre lovnbreen ( svalbard ) during 3 weeks in april 2010 .",
    "both the 50 mhz and 100 mhz antenna data , corresponding to a nominal wavelength in ice of 3.4  m and 1.7  m respectively , were collected in the form of 2806 samples within a time window 2.224 @xmath5s .",
    "all data were stacked 8 times on collection .",
    "positioning of all gpr mono - offset profiles was done using a globalsat et-312 coarse / acquisition ( c / a ) code gps receiver connected to the control unit of the gpr , set to 1 measurement per second while two operators were pulling the device at a comfortable walking pace .",
    "a trace was acquired every 0.5  s , and the average distance between traces was later calculated at 0.3  m.     to  [ prof - tongue ] . the symbol @xmath6 indicates the cmp position.,width=566 ]    snow cover was evaluated through 42 snow drilling measurements regularly spaced to cover all the glacier .",
    "these data were acquired at the time of the gpr and dual gps measurements and subsequently interpolated using ordinary kriging .",
    "the resulting snow thickness map is shown on fig .",
    "[ snow - map ] .",
    "the measurement root mean square error is 20  cm  @xcite .",
    "the average snow thickness over the entire glacier on april 2010 was estimated to 1.67  m.        in addition to the mono - offset profiles , one common mid - point ( cmp ) gather was acquired on the glacier snout using the 100 mhz antennas ( fig  [ cmp ] ) .",
    "the initial separation between antennas was 0.5  m , with a spatial stepsize of 0.5  m. cmp data were interpreted using coherence analysis , defined equivalently to semblance but using an analysis window of one temporal sample ( here , 0.8  ns ) .",
    "the basal reflection exhibits a velocity of 0.1715  m / ns ( red trajectory in cmp gather , lower pick in coherence panel ) , but coherence delivers a root - mean - square velocity that is biased systematically slow with respect to its true value  @xcite .",
    "this occurs because true velocity is only expressed by wavelet first - breaks , yet these are zero amplitude hence can not produce a coherence response .",
    "we therefore use the coherence response to simulate first - break travel - times , using the backshifting method of booth et al .  , and obtain an rms velocity of 0.1747  m / ns and a travel - time to the base of the ice of 140.0  ns ( blue trajectory in cmp gather , upper pick in coherence panel ) .    this rms velocity is then converted to interval velocity using dix s equation  @xcite . at the location of the cmp acquisition",
    ", the glacier was covered by 0.7  m of snow , which we assume to have a velocity of 0.22  m / ns @xcite and , hence , the two - way travel - time to the base of the snow is 6.3  ns .",
    "substituting our velocity - time model into dix s equation gives 0.1723@xmath30.0021  m / ns as the interval velocity through the ice , and a local ice thickness of 10.21@xmath30.16  m. the uncertainty in these values is obtained by considering the resolution of coherence analysis  @xcite , and is therefore representative of the error between a given coherence pick and its true velocity value .",
    "successive depth conversions are made with a velocity value of 0.17  m / ns , which represents the lower - bound of the error in interval velocity .",
    "we choose this value since the volumetric content of air is likely to decrease in the thicker parts of the glacier  @xcite hence we anticipate that a slower velocity is more widely representative .",
    "although cmp surveys over the thickest ice could confirm this , the fiber optic cables of our gpr system were only 20  m long , reducing our maximum offset - to - depth ratio and thereby producing a poor coherence response .",
    "finally , we will use the velocity derived from the 100 mhz dataset to depth - convert 50  mhz records .",
    "ice is weakly dispersive : across the range 1 - 100  mhz , relative dielectric permittivity decreases by 0.04  @xcite .",

    "the lower hyperbola ( red ) corresponds to the lower coherence pick , and is interpreted as the reflection from the ice  bedrock interface .",

    "each profile was chopped above the arrival time of the minimum amplitude of the direct air wave ( manually selected ) .",
    "based on the et312 c / a gps information , the mean distance @xmath7 between traces is computed .",
    "equidistant trace positioning is achieved by searching for the acquired trace located closest to a periodic grid of period @xmath7 .",

    "a gaussian fit of each histogram is performed using a constrained nonlinear optimization method : we analyze the whole dataset including all traces intersections ( blue dots ) and separately the particular case of five transects acquired 3 to 5 days apart but following the same path ( snow tracks ) .",

    "<S> finally a 10-m grid map of the bedrock topography was derived by subtracting the ice thicknesses from a dual - frequency gps - derived digital elevation model of the surface . </S>",
    "<S> these two datasets are the first step for modelling thermal evolution of the glacier and its bedrock , as well as the main hydrological network .    </S>",
