    "a crucial result for resummations based on the eikonal approximation is the fact that amplitudes for soft gauge bosons form an exponential ( `` exponentiate '' ) . for abelian gauge theory",

    "remarkably , similar results hold @xcite .    we have revisited this exponentiation with an eye to extending the eikonal approximation , and the results that are built upon it , to next - to - leading power in the soft energy / momentum .",
    "we begin by describing a simple ansatz which generalizes threshold resummation , incorporating some recent insights into the structure of ne terms in the qcd splitting functions , as well as some well - understood phase space effects . while this ansatz is successful in reproducing the bulk of ne terms for inclusive cross sections , it does not give the full answer .",
