    "a new boson of the mass around 125 gev has recently been discovered at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "it has been reported that in the diphoton channel the signal strength of the new boson is about two times larger than that predicted by the standard model ( sm ) higgs , while other channels are consistent with the sm higgs .",
    "this may imply a hint for a new scalar boson beyond the sm .",
    "for the theoretical possibilities , see , for example , a recent review  @xcite .",
    "it is the techni - dilaton ( td ) that is a candidate for such a new scalar boson : the td is a composite scalar boson predicted in the walking technicolor ( wtc )  @xcite which is characterized by an approximately scale - invariant ( conformal ) gauge dynamics and a large anomalous dimension @xmath5  .",
    "the td arises as a pseudo nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson for the spontaneous breaking of the approximate scale symmetry triggered by techni - fermion condensation .",
    "its lightness , say 125 gev , is therefore protected by the approximate scale symmetry inherent to the wtc .",
    "thus the discovery of td should imply discovery of the wtc .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the lhc signatures of the td were studied . particularly in ref .",
    "@xcite ( as well as ref .",
    "@xcite ) it was shown that the 125 gev td is consistent with the currently reported diphoton signal as well as other signals such as @xmath6 and @xmath7 , etc .. it was emphasized that , in sharp contrast to other dilaton models  @xcite ( see for example the recent analysis by ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the td is favored by the current data thanks to the presence of extra techni - fermion loop corrections to digluon and diphoton couplings .",
    "the td couplings to the sm particles take essentially the same form as those of the sm higgs .",
    "the overall scaling from the sm higgs is just given by a ratio @xmath8 , where @xmath9 gev is the electroweak scale and @xmath1 denotes the td decay constant which is in general @xmath10  .",
    "the analysis of the previous works  @xcite was based on the evaluation of @xmath1 through the assumption of the partially - conserved dilatation current ( pcdc ) which gives only a combination @xmath11 in terms of the scale anomaly , where @xmath12 is the td mass .",
    "the scale anomaly in turn was evaluated by the ladder approximation , which was further related , through pagels - stokar formula for the techni - pion decay constant @xmath2 , to the electroweak scale @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a number of weak doublet techni - fermions ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 gev for the one - family model ) .",
    "then we estimated up to the 30 % uncertainties of the ladder approximations  @xcite : @xmath17 which was then shown to be consistent with the value of the best fit to the current lhc data in the case of the one - family model ( @xmath15 ) : @xmath18    however , there is a potential problem in the ladder approximation about the mass of the td as suggested earlier  @xcite : a straightforward calculation  @xcite based on the ladder schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation and the ladder ( homogeneous ) bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation in the walking regime indicates a relatively light scalar bound state ( identified with td ) as @xmath19 ( @xmath20 gev for the one - family model ) , which is much smaller than the techni - vector / axial - vector mesons on tev range but still larger than the lhc boson at 125 gev .",
    "this result  @xcite is consistent with another calculation  @xcite based on the ladder sd equation and the ladder ( inhomogeneous ) bs equation , and also consistent with other indirect computation @xcite based on the ladder gauged nambu - jona - lasinio model .",
    "in fact the pcdc relation evaluated in the ladder approximation near the conformal window does not allow a very light td unless the td gets decoupled with divergent decay constant  @xcite : the pcdc relation reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the techni - gluon condensate with @xmath23 being a beta function of the tc gauge coupling @xmath24 and the last equation is the ladder estimate near the conformal window with @xmath25  @xcite ( for earlier references , see @xcite ) .",
    "this simply implies @xmath26 constant @xmath27 near the conformal window @xmath28 , with @xmath29 being the analogue of the @xmath30 , the intrinsic scale of the walking technicolor where the infrared conformality terminates beyond that scale .",
    "then the limit @xmath31 , where the td gets light compared with the weak scale @xmath32 , can only be realized when @xmath33 , i.e. , a decoupled limit .",
    "a possible way out would be to include fully _ nonperturbative gluonic dynamics_. actually , the ladder approximation totally ignores non - ladder dynamics most notably the full gluonic dynamics .",
    "also a direct estimate of @xmath1 free from the ladder approximation and without invoking the pcdc ( without referring to @xmath12 ) is necessary to give more implications of the td at the lhc .",
    "one such a possibility besides lattice simulations would be a holographic computation based on the gauge - gravity duality  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we make a full analysis of a holographic model dual to the wtc previously proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite by including the bulk field dual to the techni - glueball so as to incorporate the fully nonperturbative gluonic dynamics .",
    "we show that thanks to the nonperturbative gluonic dynamics in contrast to the ladder approximation , we do have an exactly massless td limit (  conformal limit \" ) : @xmath34 the resultant @xmath1 is fairly independent of the td mass @xmath12 , in contrast to the pcdc estimation in the ladder approximation .",
    "remarkably enough , in the light td case , we find a novel relation between @xmath1 and the techni - pion decay constant @xmath2 , independently of the holographic parameters : @xmath35 with @xmath4 being the number of techni - fermions .",
    "in such a light td limit the masses of techni-@xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) and -@xmath38 @xmath39 mesons also go to zero , @xmath40 , which implies a scaling property similar to the vector realization  @xcite and the vector manifestation  @xcite based on the hidden local symmetry  @xcite .",
    "we discuss the 125 gev holographic td at the lhc taking the one - family model as a definite benchmark .",
    "the td couplings to the sm particles set by the ratio @xmath8 are estimated , say , for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , to be @xmath43 ( up to @xmath44 corrections ) , which turns out to be on the best - fit value in eq.([best - fit ] ) favored by the current data on a new boson at 125 gev recently observed at the lhc  @xcite ( see table  [ tab : chi2 ] ) .",

    "actually , most of the variants of the wtc have a tendency similar to the one studied here , except for a class of wtc models without colored / charged weak - doublets , e.g. , the `` one - doublet model '' ( @xmath276 , @xmath277 gev ) which was shown  @xcite to be invisible at lhc due simply to the smallness of the coupling ( @xmath278 ) without compensating enhancement by the colored / charged techni - fermions .    as seen from eq.([mphi - fpi ] ) , in the one - family model a light td with the mass around 125 gev is realized when @xmath222 , which corresponds to the parameter @xmath279 : @xmath280 the value of this @xmath109 is compared to the real - life qcd value @xmath281  @xcite . as noted in eq.([fphi : fpi ] ) , in such a light td case , the td decay constant @xmath1 is fixed by the techni - pion decay constant @xmath2 independently of the holographic parameters as well as the number of @xmath165 . for @xmath282",
    "gev we thus estimate @xmath1 and a ratio @xmath8 to find @xmath283 for @xmath284 , i.e. , @xmath285 in accord with eq.([fphi : fpi ] ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the above result is fairly insensitive to a particular value of @xmath286 , in sharp contrast to the estimate explicitly based on the pcdc @xcite which is very sensitive to @xmath12 .",
    "note also that our result eq.([fphi : numbers ] ) is free from any additional assumption such as the ladder criticality condition @xmath287 used in ref.@xcite which was based on the ladder approximation .    once the td decay constant @xmath1 is estimated , we are now ready to discuss the lhc phenomenology of the 125 gev holographic td in the same way as in refs .",
    "@xcite : the td couplings to the sm gauge bosons are obtained just by scaling from the sm higgs as @xmath288 .",
    "the coupling to the sm-@xmath289 fermion , on the other hand , is set by the mass @xmath290 divided by @xmath1 along with a factor @xmath291 , so that the scaling goes like @xmath292  @xcite",
    ". the anomalous dimension @xmath63 for the third - generation fermions are taken to be @xmath293 so as to realize the realistic fermion masses by strong extended tc ( etc ) dynamics  @xcite , while we put @xmath48 for the other lighter fermions in order to avoid excessive flavor changing neutral currents ( see also eq.([mql:2nd ] ) ) .",
    "( throughout the holographic computations described so far , we have set @xmath5 since the holographic model is thought of as dual to wtc , not involving the sm fermion sector concerning a type of etc . )",
    "we thus have @xmath294 thus the processes involving these couplings are suppressed compared with the sm higgs by the characteristic factor @xmath295 for the typical wtc with @xmath296 .    on the contrary ,",
    "the couplings to digluon and diphoton are largely enhanced compared with the sm higgs , which somehow compensates the smallness of other couplings in eq.([scaling ] ) in most of the channels currently studied at lhc as shown before  @xcite ( see also the discussions in the next paragraph ) .   and",
    "@xmath297 couplings is generic also for other models having extra heavy fermions such as the typical fourth generation model which however , having the same couplings as that of the sm higgs , are severely constrained , in sharp contrast to our case with the suppressed couplings in eq.([scaling ] ) .",
    "] this is the most characteristic feature of the td in the generic wtc ( having colored / charged techni - fermions ) in contrast to other dilaton / radion models as well as the one - doublet model : in the case at hand , the one - family model , these couplings are in fact enhanced by the colored / charged techni - fermion loop contributions along with a factor @xmath165  @xcite : @xmath298 we thus find the scaling from the sm higgs for the couplings to @xmath297 and @xmath299 , which can approximately be expressed at around 125 gev ( detailed formulae are given in the appendix of ref.@xcite):@xcite @xmath300 where in estimating the sm contributions we have incorporated only the dominant ones , the top ( the terms having @xmath301 ) and the @xmath302 boson ( the term of 63/47 for @xmath299 rate ) loop contributions , which largely cancel each other in the diphoton channel .",
    "it is thus clear that the techni - fermion contributions overwhelm those of the sm particles for the @xmath303 channel ( for @xmath304 ) as well as the @xmath305 channel .",
    "these couplings actually play the key role to account for the presently reported excess of diphoton event rate , while the significance for other channels stays at the level similar to the sm higgs prediction : although the td production through the vector boson fusion process is suppressed by an amount of @xmath306 , the diphoton rate along with dijet becomes consistent with the current lhc data because of the large contamination with the gluon fusion events which are highly enhanced to be about 80@xmath307 or more in the case of td compared to the sm higgs case with @xmath308 30@xmath307 , due to the larger gluon fusion cross section . as for other exclusive channels with jets ,",
    "the current accuracy has not reached a level which can more precisely distinguish the production processes than the diphoton channel . as the currently most relevant event categories",
    ", we shall therefore take the @xmath309 and @xmath310 events in addition to the @xmath311 channel to be exclusive and other channels such as @xmath312 and @xmath313 to be inclusive , as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we can thus estimate the 125 gev td signals at the lhc and perform the goodness - of - fit to the currently available data set  @xcite , in a way similar to that done in ref .",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath8 found in ref .",
    "@xcite is @xmath314 for @xmath315 as in eq.([best - fit ] ) , which is slightly off by about 20%30% from the present holographic prediction eq.([fphi : numbers ] ) : @xmath316 however , such @xmath31730% corrections would come from the next - to - leading order terms in @xmath44 expansion as was discussed in ref .",
    "inclusion of the @xmath318 corrections for @xmath319 would then give a shift : @xmath320    the holographically predicted @xmath8 in eq.([holo : prediction ] ) is also consistent with the ladder estimate  @xcite , @xmath321 in eq.([vals ] )  ) roughly coincide with the value estimated from other holographic models  @xcite . ] .",
    "note that the two calculations are quite different qualitatively in a sense that the ladder calculation has no massless td limit , while the present holographic model including the nonperturbative gluonic dynamics does .",
    "nevertheless , such a numerical coincidence may suggest that both models are reflecting some reality through similar dynamical effects for the particular mass region of the 125 gev td .    using the predicted @xmath8 including the possible @xmath322 corrections for @xmath319 , in table  [ tab : chi2 ] we list the results of the @xmath323 fit based on the currently available lhc data set  @xcite .",
    "the table shows that the current data favors the holographic td in the one - family model with @xmath41 and @xmath324 ( i.e. @xmath325 ) , slightly better than the sm higgs with @xmath326 .",
    "the upcoming more data will conclude whether the td is more favorable than the sm higgs , or not .    .",
    "the results of the @xmath323 fit based on the currently available lhc data set  @xcite .",
    "the data adopted here are the same as those used in the analysis in ref .",
    "the sm higgs gives @xmath327 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in summary , we reanalyzed a holographic wtc model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite which incorporates the fully nonperturbative gluonic dynamics , in contrast to the ladder approximation .",
    "thanks to the full inclusion of the gluonic dynamics , we found a limit (  conformal limit \" ) , where the td becomes a massless nambu - goldstone boson for the scale symmetry spontaneously broken with nonzero and finite td decay constant @xmath1 , which is never realized in the ladder approximation .    in such a light td case , furthermore , we found a novel relation between the td decay constant @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( eq.([fphi : fpi ] ) ) independently of holographic parameters , which unambiguously determines the td couplings to the sm particles set by @xmath8 .",
    "note that our result is free from any additional assumption such as the ladder criticality condition @xmath287 used in ref.@xcite which was based on the ladder approximation .",
    "we then discussed the 125 gev holographic td at the lhc taking the one - family model as a definite benchmark .",
    "the td couplings to the sm particles set by the ratio @xmath8 were estimated , say , for @xmath41 and @xmath328 , to be @xmath43 ( up to @xmath44 corrections ) , which turned out to be on the best - fit value in eq.([best - fit ] ) favored by the current data on a new boson at 125 gev recently observed at the lhc  @xcite ( see table  [ tab : chi2 ] ) .",
    "it was shown that the holographically predicted @xmath8 in eq.([holo : prediction ] ) is also consistent with the ladder estimate @xmath321 in eq.([vals ] ) .",
    "although the two calculations are quite different qualitatively in a sense that the ladder calculation has no massless td limit , such a numerical coincidence may suggest that both models are reflecting some reality through similar dynamical effects for the particular mass region of the 125 gev td .",
    "we further fixed all the three holographic parameters by an extra input for the @xmath162 parameter @xmath329 .",
    "then the present holographic model predicted the masses of the techni-@xmath36 , -@xmath38 and techni - glueball @xmath330 tev , @xmath331 tev and the techni - glueball decay constant @xmath332 tev , and the dynamical mass of techni - fermion @xmath333 tev @xmath334 , for @xmath41 ( see table  [ tab : numbers:1 ] ) .",
    "finally , we shall make some comments on the  conformal limit \" : in the previous work  @xcite , actually , it was addressed that there is no massless - dilaton limit for the td , in contrast to the present result in eq.([dilaton : limit ] ) .",
    "the previous conclusion was deduced from assuming the pcdc in the ladder approximation , by which the td decay constant was calculated through the pcdc relation as in eq.([pcdc:1 ] ) to be @xmath335 as a function of the td mass @xmath12 . in the present work , on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath1 was computed directly through its definition tied with the spontaneously broken dilatation current and the scalar current correlator related to @xmath1 by the ward - takahashi identities ( see eq.([fphi : formula ] ) ) . the result in eq.([dilaton :",
    "limit ] ) is therefore a more generic and purely holographic prediction without invoking any approximations like the ladder approximation as in the previous study . in the present study , however",
    ", the pcdc relation has not explicitly been checked simply because there is no source for the trace of energy - momentum tensor @xmath336 in the present model , which is a problem to be studied in the future .",
