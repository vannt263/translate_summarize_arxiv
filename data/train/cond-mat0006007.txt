    "a lifshitz point @xcite is a critical point at which a disordered phase , a spatially homogeneous ordered phase , and a spatially modulated phase meet . in the case of a @xmath0-dimensional system with an @xmath1-component order parameter , it is called an @xmath2-lifshitz point ( or @xmath3-axial lifshitz point ) if a wave - vector instability occurs in an @xmath3-dimensional subspace .",
    "such multi - phase points are known to occur in a variety of distinct physical systems , including magnetic ones @xcite , ferroelectric crystals @xcite , charge - transfer salts,@xcite liquid crystals,@xcite systems undergoing structural phase transitions@xcite or having domain - wall instabilities,@xcite and the annni model.@xcite a survey covering the work related to them till 1992 has been given by selke,@xcite which complements and updates an earlier review by hornreich.@xcite recently there has also been renewed interest in the effects of surfaces on the critical behavior at lifshitz points.@xcite    from a general vantage point , critical behavior at lifshitz points is an interesting subject in that it presents clear and simple examples of _ anisotropic scale invariance_. epitomized also by dynamic critical phenomena near thermal equilibrium,@xcite and known to occur as well in other static equilibrium systems ( e.g. , uniaxial dipolar ferromagnets ) , this kind of invariance has gained increasing attention in recent years since it was found to be realized in many non - equilibrium systems such as driven diffusive systems @xcite and in growth processes.@xcite    systems at lifshitz points are good candidates for studying general aspects of anisotropic scale invariance.@xcite for one thing , the continuum theories representing the universality classes of systems with short - range interactions at @xmath2-lifshitz points are conceptually simple ; second , they involve the degeneracy @xmath3 as a parameter , which can easily be varied between @xmath15 and @xmath0 .",
    "a thorough understanding of critical behavior at such lifshitz points is clearly very desirable .",
    "the problem has been studied decades ago by means of an @xmath5 expansion about the upper critical dimension@xcite @xmath16 other investigations employed the dimensionality expansion about the lower critical dimension@xcite @xmath17 for @xmath18 , or the @xmath19 expansion .",
    "@xcite unfortunately , the @xmath5-expansion results to order @xmath11 one group of authors@xcite obtained for the correlation exponents @xmath8 and @xmath9 and the wave - vector exponent @xmath10 are in conflict with those of sak and grest@xcite for the cases @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    in order to resolve this long - standing controversy , mergulho and carneiro@xcite recently presented a reanalysis of the problem based on renormalized field theory and dimensional regularization . exploiting the form of the resulting renormalization - group equations , they were able to derive various ( previously given ) general scaling laws one expects to hold according to the phenomenological theory of scaling .",
    "however , their calculation of critical exponents was limited in a twofold fashion : they treated merely the special cases @xmath13 and @xmath14 , in which considerable simplifications occur .",
    "their results for @xmath8 and @xmath9 to order @xmath11 , agree with sak and grests@xcite but disagree with mukamels.@xcite second , the exponent @xmath10 ( an independent exponent that does not follow from these correlation exponents via a scaling law ) was not considered at all by them .",
    "thus it is an open question whether sak and grest s or mukamel s @xmath20 results for @xmath10 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 are correct .",
    "furthermore , for other values of @xmath3 , the published @xmath20 results@xcite for the exponents @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 remain unchecked .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to fill these gaps and to determine the @xmath5 expansion of the critical exponents @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 for _ general values _ of @xmath3 to order @xmath11 .",
    "technically , we shall employ dimensional regularization in conjunction with minimal subtraction of poles in @xmath5 .",
    "this way of fixing the counterterms appears to us somewhat more convenient than the use of normalization conditions ( as was done in refs .   and ) . in order to overcome the rather demanding technical challenges ,",
    "we have found it useful to work directly in position space .",
    "thus the laurent expansion of the distributions to which the feynman graphs of the primitively divergent vertex functions correspond in position space must be determined to the required order in @xmath5 .",
    "the source of the technical difficulties is that these feynman graphs , at criticality , involve a free propagator @xmath21 which is a _",
    "generalized homogeneous _ rather than a homogeneous function , because of the _ anisotropic _ scale invariance of the free theory .",
    "while such a situation is encountered also in other cases of anisotropic scale invariance , the scaling function associated with @xmath21 turns out to be a particularly complicated function in the present case of a general @xmath2-lifshitz point .",
    "( for general values of @xmath3 , it is a sum of two generalized hypergeometric functions . )    in the next section , we recall the familiar continuum model describing the critical behavior at a @xmath2-lifshitz point and discuss its renormalization . in sec .",

    "if we wanted to regularize the uv singularities via a cutoff @xmath52 ( restricting the integrations over parallel and perpendicular momenta by @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) , they would be needed to absorb uv singularities quadratic and linear in @xmath52 , respectively .    in the renormalization scheme we use ,",

    "this follows from the fact that the primitive divergences of the momentum - space vertex functions @xmath64 and @xmath65 , at any order of @xmath36 , are poles in @xmath5 whose residua depend linearly on @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath38 in the case of the former and are independent of these momenta and mass parameters in the case of the latter . subtracting these poles minimally as usual implies that these renormalization factors differ from @xmath15 through laurent series in @xmath5 : @xmath69",

    "the procedure yields very accurate numerical values of the requested integrals .",
    "the reader may convince himself of the precision by comparing the so - determined numerical values of the integrals for @xmath13 and @xmath14 with the analytically known exact values .",
    "for example , in a recent investigation@xcite of the question of whether anisotropic scale invariance may lead to an even larger invariance group ( reminiscent of conformal or schrdinger invariance ) such systems were explicitly considered .                          to see this within the present calculational scheme , note that @xmath351 is nothing but the fourier transform of @xmath352 at zero momentum @xmath353 .",
