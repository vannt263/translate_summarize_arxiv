    "the heisenberg model may well be considered the cornerstone of the modern theory of magnetic systems ; the reason for such an important role is the simple structure of the hamiltonian , whose symmetries underlie its peculiar features .",
    "the basic forces which determine the alignment of the spins , are represented by the exchange integrals @xmath0 s . at variance with the ferromagnet where the parallel alignment is promoted , in the antiferromagnet",
    "a lot of peculiar arrangements of the spins can occur , with strong differences between classical and quantum systems . as matter of fact , also for nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions the ground state of the hamiltonian is different from the nel state with antialigned spins , and the ( staggered ) magnetization shows the so called _ spin reduction _ with respect to the saturation value also at @xmath1 .",
    "the linear excitations of an antiferromagnet can be roughly associated in two families and pair excitations with vanishing total magnetization are possible : the fact that the total momentum of these can be close to zero allows for their investigation by light scattering .",
    "while these peculiar features of antiferromagnetism already occur in three - dimensional ( 3d ) compounds , they are more pronounced in the low - dimensional ones , where other effects caused by the enhanced role of classical and quantum fluctuations are present and exotic spin configurations associated with field theory models can appear .",
    "indeed , the last two decades have seen a renewed interest both in the case of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet ( qhaf ) , for which a peculiar behavior of the ground state vs spin value was predicted  @xcite , and of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) qhaf , because of its theoretically challenging properties and of the fact that it models the magnetic behavior of the parent compounds of some high-@xmath2 superconductors  @xcite .",
    "the experimental activity on 2d antiferromagnets stems from the existence of several real compounds whose crystal structure is such that the magnetic ions form parallel planes and interact strongly only if belonging to the same plane . as a consequence of such structure ,",
    "their magnetic behavior is indeed 2d down to those low temperatures where the weak interplane interaction becomes relevant , driving the system towards a 3d ordered phase .",
    "in addition , the 2d heisenberg model can be enriched trough symmetry - breaking terms  we considered easy - axis ( ea ) and easy - plane ( ep ) anisotropy , as well as an external uniform magnetic field  which are useful to reproduce the experimental behavior of many layered compounds .",
    "in the ea case one is left with a discrete reflection symmetry and the system undergoes an ising - like phase transition . in the ep case or",
    "when a magnetic field is applied the residual @xmath3 symmetry prevents finite - temperature ordering  @xcite , but vortex excitations are possible and determine a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition between a paramagnetic and a quasi - ordered phase . in spite of the tiny anisotropies of real systems ( usually @xmath4 ) , it can be shown that they dramatically change the behavior of the spin array already at temperatures of the order of @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    "we report about the progresses in the theory of heisenberg antiferromagnets that have been obtained by our group in firenze .",
    "the early work on the theory of two - magnon raman scattering is summarized in section  [ s.2magnon ] , while the following sections report about the recent activity on low - dimensional antiferromagnetism .",
    "section  [ s.1d ] is devoted to 1d models , and concerns the study of the effect of soliton - like excitations in the compound tmmc , as well as the anisotropic spin-@xmath5 model , for which a reduced description of the ground state allows one to investigate the quantum phase transition in a unitarily transformed representation and to obtain quantitative results for the phase diagram .",
    "section  [ s.isotropic ] concerns the theory of the isotropic 2d qhaf , for which we reproduced the experimental correlation length by means of a semiclassical approach , also deriving the connection with ( and the limitations of ) famous quantum field theory results . in section  [ s.anisotropic ]",
    "we summarize several recent results concerning the anisotropic 2d qhaf , with emphasis onto the different phase diagrams and the experimentally measurable signatures of xy or ising behavior .",
    "eventually , in section  [ s.j1j2 ] results on the 2d frustrated @xmath6-@xmath7 isotropic model are described .",
    "the scattering of radiation is a very powerful tool to study elementary excitations in condensed matter physics .",
    "any complete experiment gives rise to a quasi - elastic component due to non - propagating or diffusive modes and to symmetrically shifted spectra corresponding to the states of the system under investigation with an amplitude ratio governed by the detailed balance principle .",
    "the most sensitive probes for this investigation are undoubtedly thermal neutrons , because the characteristic energies and wavevectors fit very well with those of the magnetic elementary excitations . however , light - scattering experiments can require a simpler apparatus and offer a better accuracy , although the transfer wavevector @xmath8 is much smaller than the size of the brillouin zone so that usually only the center of this zone can be directly probed",
    ". in spite of this , two - spin raman scattering involving the creation and destruction of a pair of elementary excitations can be performed , with the contribution of two magnons having equal frequencies and opposite wavevectors .",
    "this two - magnon scattering is expected to be spread over a band of frequencies in antiferromagnets .",
    "however , the density of states strongly enhances the contribution of zone - boundary ( zb ) excitations  @xcite , i.e. , at @xmath9 .",
    "while in ferromagnets the two - spin process is only due to a second order mechanism , orders of magnitude smaller than the first order one , in antiferromagnets a different independent process is permitted , stronger than the corresponding one for single - spin spectra  @xcite . specifically , an exchange mechanism does not change the total @xmath10-component of the spins : exciting two magnons in the two different sublattices @xmath11  @xcite is the dominant scattering process .",
    "the one - spin raman scattering peak disappears at the nel temperature because it probes the smallest wavevectors , related with the long - range correlations .",
    "in contrast , two - magnon raman scattering essentially probes the highest wavevectors , related to short - range correlations .",
    "therefore two - spin raman scattering features persist also in the paramagnetic phase  @xcite where short - range order is still present .",
    "let us consider the following antiferromagnetic hamiltonian with exchange integral @xmath12 , @xmath10 nearest neighbors with displacements labeled by @xmath13 , and two @xmath14 sublattices  @xcite : @xmath15 the scattering cross section @xmath16 turns out  @xcite to be proportional to the fourier transform of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the effective raman scattering operator .",
    "many antiferromagnetic compounds can be mapped onto this model , even though a small next - nearest - neighbor exchange interaction without competitive effects , as well as anisotropy terms could be present .",

    "one of the most surprising evidence of the difference between ferro- and antiferromagnetic systems is related with the so - called haldane conjecture , i.e. with @xmath1 properties of integer - spin antiferromagnetic chains .",
    "in general , we expect three possible situations for the ground state of a magnetic system : either it is ordered ( with finitely constant correlation functions ) , or quasi - ordered ( with power - law decaying correlation functions ) , or completely disordered ( with exponentially decaying correlation functions ) .",
    "one could intuitively expect the third option to be possibly dismissed , based on the idea that , when thermal fluctuations are completely suppressed , the system be in an ordered or at least quasi - ordered ground state .",

    "after more than two decades haldane s idea that integer - spin systems can have a genuinely disordered ground state still stands as a conjecture .",
    "however , theoretical  @xcite , experimental  @xcite and numerical  @xcite works have definitely confirmed its validity .",
    "let us consider eq .",
    "( [ h.haldane ] ) for integer spin : in the @xmath80 plane one may identify different quantum phases , corresponding to models whose ground states share common features . for @xmath81 three phases",
    "are singled out : the nel phase ( @xmath82 ) , where the ground state has a nel - like structure , the so - called _ large-_@xmath79 phase ( @xmath83 ) , where the ground state is characterized by a large majority of sites where @xmath84 , and the haldane phase , which extends around the isotropic point ( @xmath85 ) , and is characterized by disordered ground states .",
    "we first deal with the ising limit , @xmath86 : upon its ground state , the antiferromagnetically ordered nel state , one may construct three types of excitations : a single deviation , a direct soliton , an indirect soliton , where _ direct _ ( _ indirect _ ) refers to the fact that the excitation be generated by flipping all the spins on the right of a given site while keeping the @xmath10 component of the spin on such site unchanged ( setting it to zero ) .",
    "the above configurations have all energy @xmath87 with respect to that of the ground state , and do generate , when properly combined , all the excited states ; amongst them , we concentrate upon those containing a couple of adjacent indirect solitons and notice that their energy is @xmath88 , while excited states containing two separate indirect solitons have energy @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , indirect solitons are characterized by a bounding energy @xmath90 ; moreover , one may easily see that isolated solitons may effectively introduce disorder in the global configuration of the system , while coupled solitons do only reduce the magnetization of each of the two antiferromagnetic sublattices  @xcite .",
    "in fact , strings containing any odd ( even ) number of adjacent solitons act on the order of the global configuration as if they were isolated ( coupled ) solitons .",
    "as we move from the ising limit , the transverse interaction @xmath91 comes into play , and is seen  @xcite to more efficiently lower the energy of the system by delocalizing indirect solitons rather than single deviations or direct solitons , thus indicating configurations which uniquely contain indirect solitons as crucial in understanding how the system evolves from the ising limit ( nel phase ) to the isotropic case(haldane phase ) .    from the above ideas we may draw a simple but suggestive scheme for such evolution :    - in the ising limit ( @xmath92 ) the ground state is the antiferromagnetically ordered nel state ;",
    "- as @xmath90 decreases , indirect solitons appear along the chain in pairs , thus keeping the antiferromagnetic order ;    - as @xmath90 is further lowered , indirect soliton pairs dissociate due to the transverse interaction which , by spreading solitons along the chain , can cause the ground state to be disordered .    due to the privileged role of indirect solitons in the above scheme , we concentrate on configurations which do only contain indirect solitons .",
    "such configurations generate a subspace for the hilbert space of the system , which is referred to , in the literature , as the _ reduced _ hilbert space  @xcite .",
    "states belonging to the _ reduced _ hilbert space are strongly characterized by the fact that if one eliminates all sites with @xmath84 , a perfectly antiferromagnetically ordered chain is left .",
    "remarkably , this type of order , which is called _ hidden order _ in the literature , is not destroyed by soliton pairs dissociation , and it actually characterizes the disordered ground state of a haldane system , as discussed below .    in 1992",
    "kennedy and tasaki ( kt ) defined a non - local unitary transformation  @xcite which makes the _ hidden order _",

    "the interplane interaction in these compounds is several orders of magnitude smaller than the intraplane one , thus offering a large temperature region where their magnetic behavior is indeed 2d down to those low temperatures where the weak interplane interaction becomes relevant , driving the system towards a 3d ordered phase : an antiferromagnetic heisenberg interaction and the small spin value make these compounds behave as 2d qhafs .",
    "even the onset of 3d magnetic long - range order is however strongly affected by the 2d properties of the system : indeed , the observed 3d magnetic transition temperature is comparable with the intraplane interaction energy , i.e. , several order of magnitude larger than that one can expect only on the basis of the value of the interplane coupling . such apparently odd behavior can be easily understood by observing that the establishing of in - plane correlations on a characteristic distance @xmath205 effectively enhances the interplane coupling by a factor @xmath206 , @xmath66 being the lattice constant .",
    "the latter consideration is one of the reasons explaining why most of the attention , both from the experimental and theoretical point of view , was devoted to the low - temperature behavior of the correlation length @xmath205 of the 2d qhaf ( in the following @xmath205 will be always given in units of the lattice constant @xmath66 ) .",

    "in addition to the first approximations usually employed to investigate the low temperature properties of magnetic systems as , e.g. , mean - field and ( modified ) spin - wave theory , the critical behavior of the 2d qhaf was commonly interpreted on the basis of the results obtained by field theory starting from the so - called 2d _ quantum nonlinear @xmath214 model _",

    "the relation between the 2d qhaf and the qnl@xmath214 m was first exploited to interpret the experimental data on cuprous oxides by chakravarty , halperin , and nelson  @xcite ( chn ) who used symmetry arguments to show that the long - wavelength physics of the qhaf is the same of that of the qnl@xmath214 m ; in other words the physical observables of the two models show the same functional dependence upon @xmath27 , if the long - wavelength excitations are assumed to be the only relevant ones , as one expects to be at low temperature .    the analysis carried out by chn on the qnl@xmath214 m lead to single out three different regimes , called _ quantum disordered _ , _ quantum critical _ ( qcr ) and _ renormalized classical _ ( rcr ) , the most striking difference amongst them being the temperature dependence of the spin correlations .",

    "however , with the accumulation of new experimental data on higher spin compounds it clearly emerged that the experimentally observed behavior of @xmath227 for larger spin could not be reproduced neither by the original simplified ( 2-loop ) form of eq .",
    "( [ e.xich2n2 ] ) given by chn ( which does not contain the term in square brackets ) , nor by the three - loops result ( [ e.xich2n2 ] ) derived by hasenfratz and niedermayer  @xcite ( hn ) ; moreover no trace of qcr behavior was found in pure compounds .",
    "the discrepancies observed could be due to the fact that the real compounds do not behave like 2d qhaf or to an actual inadequacy of the theory . in particular the chn - hn scheme introduces two possible reasons for such inadequacy to occur : the physics of the 2d qhaf is not properly described by that of the 2d qnl@xmath214 m and/or the two(three)-loop renormalization - group expressions derived by chn - hn do hold at temperatures lower than those experimentally accessible .",
    "after an almost ten years long debate , the latter possibility has finally emerged as the correct one , being strongly supported not only by our own work , but also by other independent theoretical approaches  @xcite , joined with the analysis of the experimental and the most recent quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) data for the 2d qhaf .",
    "the theoretical approach we employed to investigate the 2d qhaf is the effective hamiltonian method  @xcite , developed within the framework of the _ pure - quantum self - consistent harmonic approximation _ ( pqscha ) we introduced at the beginning of the 90 s  @xcite .",
    "the pqscha starts from the hamiltonian path - integral formulation of statistical mechanics which allows one to separate in a natural way classical and quantum fluctuations : only the latter are then treated in a self - consistent harmonic approximation , finally getting an effective classical hamiltonian , whose properties can thereafter be investigated by all the techniques available for classical systems .",
    "the idea of separating classical and quantum fluctuations turned out to be fruitful not only in view of the implementation of the pqscha , but also in the final understanding of the connection between semiclassical approaches and quantum field theories  @xcite , which could be possible also thanks to the paper by hasenfratz  @xcite about corrections to the field - theoretical results due to cutoff effects .",
    "the pqscha naturally applies to bosonic systems , whose hamiltonian is written in terms of conjugate operators @xmath228 , @xmath229 such that @xmath230\\,{=}\\,i\\delta_{mn}$ ] ; the method , however , does not require @xmath231 to be standard , i.e. , with separate quadratic kinetic @xmath232-dependent and potential @xmath233-dependent terms , and its application may be extended also to magnetic systems , according to the following scheme  @xcite : the spin hamiltonian @xmath234 is mapped to @xmath235 by a suitable spin - boson transformation ; once the corresponding weyl symbol @xmath236 , with @xmath237 and @xmath238 classical phase - space variables , has been determined , the pqscha renormalizations may be evaluated and the effective classical hamiltonian @xmath239 and effective classical function @xmath240 corresponding to the observable @xmath241 of interest follow . finally the effective functions @xmath242 and @xmath243 , both depending on classical spin variables @xmath244 with @xmath245 and containing temperature- and spin - dependent quantum renormalized parameters , are reconstructed by the inverse of the classical analogue of the spin - boson transformation used at the beginning .    in order to successfully carry out such renormalization scheme , the weyl symbol of the bosonic hamiltonian must be a well - behaved function in the whole phase space .",
    "spin - boson transformations , on the other hand , can introduce singularities as a consequence of the topological impossibility of a global mapping of a spherical phase space into a flat one .",
    "the choice of the transformation must then be such that the singularities occur for configurations which are not thermodynamically relevant , and whose contribution may be hence approximated .",
    "most of the methods for studying magnetic systems do in fact share this problem with the pqscha ; what makes the difference is that by using the pqscha one separates the classical from the pure - quantum contribution to the thermal fluctuations , and the approximation only regards the latter , being the former exactly taken into account when the effective hamiltonian is recast in the form of a classical spin hamiltonian .",
    "the spin - boson transformation which constitutes the first step of the magnetic pqscha is chosen according to the symmetry properties of the original hamiltonian and of its ground state . in the case of the 2d qhaf",

    "indeed the minimum energy corresponds to a configuration with the three sublattices aligned in the easy plane at equal angles @xmath365 .",
    "as clockwise and counterclockwise plaquette vorticities are possible , this configuration is twofold degenerate and there is chiral symmetry , which corresponds to an ising - like order parameter .",
    "therefore both a bkt and an ising transition coexist in the system .",
    "we have studied the triangular antiferromagnet both in the classical  @xcite and in the quantum  @xcite case , constructing the phase diagram for varying anisotropy and showing that the transitions occur at slightly different temperatures .",
    "an interesting behavior is shown by the 2d heisenberg antiferromagnet when a magnetic field is applied .",
    "indeed , a frustration phenomenon occurs , as antiferromagnetism tends to antialign spins while the field tends to align them with itself : in the classical system  @xcite it appears that the minimum - energy configuration is the one with the spins almost orthogonal to the field and canted in its direction .",
    "therefore , provided the field is not strong enough to overcome the exchange and to saturate the magnetization , it acts as an effective easy - plane anisotropy and one expects to observe bkt behavior .",
    "remarkably , as this can be induced in a real quasi-2d antiferromagnetic system by means of an applied field , the strength of the effective anisotropy is in this case _",
    "tunable_. even though 2d criticality just acts as a trigger for 3d ordering , by observing that the critical temperature follows the predicted behavior upon the field , an experiment could realize an objective observation of genuine 2d behavior .",
    "the 2d qhaf in a uniform magnetic field is described by the hamiltonian @xmath366 where @xmath367 is the applied zeeman field , @xmath368 the bohr magneton , and @xmath223 the gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "we have studied  @xcite the @xmath369 2d qhaf in an uniform magnetic field by means of the qmc method based on the worm algorithm .",
    "our results confirmed that an arbitrarily small field is able to induce a bkt transition and an extended @xmath325 phase above it , as in the case of an easy - plane exchange anisotropy .",
    "the field - induced @xmath325 behavior becomes more and more marked for increasing fields , while for strong fields the antiferromagnetic behavior along the field axis is nearly washed out , so that the system behaves as a planar rotator model with antiferromagnetism surviving in the orthogonal plane only ; the bkt critical temperature , as reported in fig  [ f.h_tc ] ( where @xmath370 and @xmath371 ) , vanishes as the field reaches the saturation value @xmath372 and the effective rotator length goes to zero .",
    "we have therefore shown that the model in a moderately strong field represents an ideal realization of the @xmath325 model and that @xmath325 behavior can be detected by measuring standard non - critical quantities , as the specific heat or the induced magnetization ; an experimental realization of the @xmath325 model in purely magnetic systems and a systematic investigation of the dynamics of vortex / antivortex excitations is therefore possible .",

    "they also provided quantitative estimates of the critical temperatures in the large-@xmath386 limit for both the classical and the quantum cases .",
