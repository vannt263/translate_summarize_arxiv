    "investigations on the physical properties of 1111 phase of the iron - pnictide superconductors are restricted remarkably , compared with the 122 phase and 11 phase , due to the difficulties in obtaining high - quality and sizable single crystals .",
    "nacl and kcl were first used as the flux and small single crystals with small sizes of 20 - 70 @xmath4 m can be obtained  @xcite because of the low solubility of nacl / kcl flux . then the high pressure method was developed and the crystal size was enhanced to several hundred micrometers  @xcite .",
    "after that , a new flux naas used under ambient pressure was reported to improve the crystal size  @xcite , but the crystal quality is not sufficient for the physical investigations possibly due to the extrinsic contaminants induced by the flux .",
    "a noteworthy progress in this field was made by our group by using the caas flux , where millimeter sized single crystals of cafeasf with high quality was grown successfully  @xcite .",
    "it is the parent compound of the fluorine - based 1111 phase of the iron - pnictide superconductors , whose @xmath2 can be increased to above 50 k by doping rare - earth elements to the sites of the alkaline - earth elements and to above 20 k by doping transition - metal elements to the sites of fe  @xcite .    to grow the doped single crystals with superconductivity",
    "was found to be more difficult than we expected .",
    "after many trials , single crystals of co - doped cafeasf were demonstrated to be the breakthrough and grown successfully . in this paper , we report the technical approaches to grow the cafe@xmath0co@xmath1asf single crystals with a high quality and large size .",
    "the compositions and structure of the crystals were determined .",
    "the superconducting properties were confirmed by the low - temperature resistivity and magnetization measurements .",
    "we also checked the influence of the pressure on the superconductivity .",
    "the cafe@xmath0co@xmath5asf single crystals were grown on the basis of the successful growth of the parent phase cafeasf , where a caas self - flux method was developed  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the cafeasf single crystals can been grown successfully with different initial raw materials as the following formulas ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) describe .",
    "@xmath6 @xmath7 based on the formula ( 1 ) , two approaches ( see formula ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ) was tried to substitute co to the site of fe and both were found to be successful in growing the single crystals .",
    "@xmath8 @xmath9 starting from formula ( 2 ) , only fe@xmath10as can be substituted by co@xmath10as and we have the following formula to grow the single crystals of cafe@xmath0co@xmath5asf .",
    "@xmath11    in practice , the arsenide precursors caas , fe@xmath10as and co@xmath10as were first synthesized by heating a mixture of ca granules ( purity 99.5% , alfa aesar ) , fe powder ( 99+% , alfa aesar ) , co powder ( 99.8% , alfa aesar ) , and as grains ( purity 99.995% , alfa aesar ) at 700 - 800 @xmath12c for 10 - 15 h in an evacuated quartz tube . then homemade precursors and other reagents was mixed according to formula ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) and placed into a crucible .",
    "the purities of the reagents are fef@xmath10 ( purity 99% , alfa aesar ) , cof@xmath10 ( purity 98% ,",
    "alfa aesar ) , and caf@xmath10 ( purity 99.95% , alfa aesar ) .",
    "all the weighing and mixing procedures were carried out in a glove box with a protective argon atmosphere .",
    "finally , the crucible was sealed in a quartz tube with vacuum .",
    "the quartz tube was heated at 950 @xmath12c for 40 h firstly , and then it was heated up to 1230 @xmath12c where it remained for 20 h. finally it was cooled down to 900 @xmath12c at a rate of 2 @xmath12c / h and followed with a quick cooling down to room temperature . in the end , by exposing the resultant to air in the fume hood for a few days , the flux caas decomposed and the single crystals appeared .",
    "we found that all of the three methods are successful to obtain the cafe@xmath0co@xmath5asf single crystals and the quality of the single crystals is very similar to each other with a small fluctuation of @xmath2 for about @xmath13 k , so we will not distinguish them in our paper .",
    "the microstructure was examined by scanning electron microscopy ( sem , zeiss supra55 ) .",
    "the composition of the single crystals was checked and determined by energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( eds ) measurements on an bruker device with the model quantax200 .",

    "it is clear that the diffraction peaks for the doped sample shifts to the right sides compared with the parent compound , suggesting the shrinkage of the crystal along the @xmath19 axis .",
    "the raw data of xrd was analyzed by powderx software  @xcite , where the zero - shift , k@xmath20-elimination and other factors were taken into account .",
    "the c - axis lattice parameters was calculated to be 8.584 and 8.547 for the samples with @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively , which is consistent with the results of the polycrystalline samples  @xcite .",
    "temperature dependence of resistivity in the temperature range from 0 to 300 k for the single crystal cafe@xmath0co@xmath5asf with @xmath3 = 0.12 is shown in figure [ fig3](a ) .",
    "the @xmath23 curve is lowered gradually with the decrease of temperature above 100 k , and followed by a clear upwarp below 100 k , which suggests that the sample is slightly underdoped .",
    "the onset of the superconducting transition appears at about 22 k , whereas the zero resistivity is reached at about 20 k. the dc magnetic susceptibility for the same sample was measured under a magnetic field of 10 oe in zero - field - cooling and field - cooling processes , which is presented in figure [ fig3](b ) with temperature between 0 and 40 k. in order to minimize the effect of the demagnetization , the magnetic field was applied parallel to the ab - plane of the crystal .",

    "the magnetization susceptibility under different pressures for the sample cafe@xmath0co@xmath5asf with @xmath3 = 0.12 was obtained using mcell 10 .",
    "the pressure was generated using a be - cu pressure cell with a teflon cup which was filled with the pressure - transmitting medium .",
