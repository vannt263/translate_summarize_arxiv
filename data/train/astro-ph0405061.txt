    "low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , are semi - detached binary systems where a normal low - mass late type star transfers gas onto a compact remnant i.e. a neutron star or black hole .",
    "a significant fraction of lmxbs are soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) characterized by episodic x - ray outbursts where the luminosity increases dramatically . during the long intervals ( usually many years ) between outbursts ,",
    "the sxts are in quiescence and the optical emission is dominated by the radiation from the companion star .",
    "this offers a superb opportunity to analyze and obtain dynamical information which eventually enables us to constrain the nature of the compact object ( see eg .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the majority of these systems appear to contain black holes and they are , in fact , the best evidence we have for the existence of stellar mass black holes .",
    "the most secure case is the sxt v404 cyg which has a mass function of @xmath6 ( casares , charles & naylor 1992 ) , twice the usually accepted upper limit to that of a neutron star @xcite .",
    "the estimated mass for the compact object is 12@xmath02m@xmath7 @xcite which , together with gro 1915 + 105 @xcite , are the most massive stellar mass black holes yet measured .",
    "+ furthermore , v404 cyg is considered a peculiar sxt because it has one the longest orbital periods ( 6.5d ; @xcite ) and is the most x - ray luminous in quiescence ( @xmath8ergs@xmath9 ; @xcite ) . apart from this",
    ", it is largely known that v404 cyg exhibits short - term ( sub - orbital ) variations during quiescence in the optical continuum @xcite and h@xmath10 flux @xcite where the h@xmath10 profiles seems to be correlated to the continuum @xcite .",
    "the infrared @xcite , x - rays @xcite and radio @xcite are also variable .",
    "recent simultaneous observations in x - rays and optical show that optical line and continuum variability are well correlated with x - rays flares ( hynes et al . in preparation ) . on the other hand it seems that fast variability during quiescence is not a peculiarity of v404 cyg but a fingerprint of quiescent sxts , irrespective of the nature of the compact object ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter zcs ) .",
    "although these variations seem to originate in the accretion disc rather than in the optical companion or gas stream / hot spot ( * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* zcs ) the underlaying physical mechanism is not yet understood .",
    "the dynamical ( keplerian ) timescales associated with these fluctuations suggest that the flares are produced in the outer disc ( zcs ) .",
    "alternatively , based on the similarities of the power density spectrum ( pds ) of a0620 - 00 to those of low / hard state sources @xcite have pointed out that the optical variability is at least partly related to the inner accretion flow even in quiescence .",
    "this suggestion was also supported by the discovery of the correlated optical and x - ray flares ( hynes et al . in preparation ) .",
    "+ since v404 cyg is the brightest sxt , and hence accessible with 1-m type telescopes , we embarked on a study of the fast variability over the period 19922003 .",
    "this paper comprises of a simultaneous optical and infrared photometric study , with the aim to determining the colour of the variability and its possible origin .",
    "we obtained ccd photometry of v404 cyg with various 1m - class telescopes during the years 1992 , 1998 , 1999 , 2001 , 2002 and 2003 .",
    "the 1992 data were obtained in the johnson @xmath5 band with the gec ccd camera on the 1 m jkt telescope at observatorio del roque de los muchachos .",
    "v404 cyg was observed in 1998 simultaneously in the @xmath5 and @xmath2 band with identical thomson ccd cameras at both the 0.8 m iac80 and 1 m ogs telescopes at observatorio del teide .",

    "the true v404 cyg @xmath5-band lightcurves were obtained after subtracting the contribution of the _ contaminating _ companion star , assuming that it had @xmath5=17.52@xmath00.01 as given in @xcite .",
    "we then folded our data using the ephemeris of @xcite .",
    "these lightcurves show the classical secondary s ellipsoidal modulation ( see @xcite ) although with superposed variability .",
    "+ the ellipsoidal modulation is due to the differing aspects that the tidally distorted secondary star presents to the observer through the orbital cycle .",
    "an ideal pure ellipsoidal lightcurve is hence a double humped modulation with two equal maxima and two somewhat different minima ( the minimum at phase 0.5 is deeper because gravity darkening is more pronounced in the direction of the @xmath11 point @xcite .",
    "this modulation was first simulated employing two sine waves at the orbital frequency and its first harmonic , where the fundamental allows the minima to vary .",
    "relative phases were fixed to produce equal maxima .",
    "however , it has been largely reported that lightcurves of quiescent transients often exhibit unequal maxima as well ( eg . a0620 - 00 : @xcite- j1118 + 480 : @xcite- j2123 - 058 : @xcite ) .",
    "the distortions from the theoretical case could be explained assuming a non - constant contribution of the accretion disc , x - ray heating , spots on the surface of the secondary star or light from the stream impact point . in any case",
    ", we also account for this possibility by allowing the sine phases to vary independently .",
    "we then fitted these two models to the mean light curve and also to the lower envelope .",
    "the lower envelope was constructed as has been previously explained in @xcite and zcs , that is , for each night we have selected all brightness estimates which differ from the minimum by no more than twice the accuracy of the observations .",
    "the selected data were then averaged in time and phase intervals .",
    "we found the best representation ( the minimum @xmath12 ) fitting the lower envelope with the second model .",
    "these fits for the years with a most complete database ( 1992 , 1998 and 2001 ) are shown in figure  [ elipmodel ] .",
    "both minimum and maximum magnitudes varies .",
    "the maximum at phase 0.25 is higher than at phase 0.75 and also the minimun at phase 0.5 is deeper than at phase 0 .",
    "however their relative strength changes from year to year . apart from this , the peak to peak amplitude of the first harmonic remains roughly constant at 0.24@xmath00.01 magnitudes , a key fact in the modeling of v404 cyg and the determination of its component masses . we note that the 1998 lightcurve obtained by @xcite in the same band exhibits equal maxima , however we can not conclude whether this behaviour reflects a real change in the system , since both lightcurves are not simultaneous , or is due to an incomplete sampling .",
    "we assumed that the fast variability superimposed on the ellipsoidal curve is not related to the ellipsoidal modulation so the former was isolated by subtracting the lower envelope variable - phase sinusoidal fit ( as has been explained in the previous subsection ) from the original data resulting in a light curve essentially free from the ellipsoidal modulation . in the case of the 1999 lightcurve , because only two nights of observations were available , we fixed all the parameters of the double sine wave obtained from the 1998 fit except the phase of the first sine . in 2003",
    "only five nights of observations are available so we fixed the mean magnitude in the variable - phase fit at the value we obtained with the simplest constant relative phase fit . furthermore , in order to compare the results from different years , we have resampled the lightcurves to have the same temporal resolution ( 320s ) .",
    "the lightcurves and the corresponding lower envelope fits are shown in figure  [ elip+var ] and the result of the subtraction is represented in figure  [ var ] .",
    "+ examining these lightcurves we find that the observed variations resemble the lightcurves of stellar flares , i.e. rapid and strong increases in brightness .",
    "we consider a _",
    "flare _ to be any variation which differs from the mean level by more than 3@xmath13 .",
    "we found in many nights large single events of @xmath12h or more duration appearing together with faster and small amplitude variations .",
    "other nights , however , only the faster variations are present .",
    "the shape of the large flares seem to be symmetric with similar rise and decay times . in order to characterize the flares and quantify the flare activity we calculate the mean , @xmath14 , standard deviation corrected for the instrumental error , @xmath15 ( i.e. we subtract the instrumental error in quadrature ) and _ equivalent duration _ ( @xmath16 ) of the relative intensity lightcurves , i.e. relative to the steady non - variable level ( see zcs ) .    here",
    "_ z _ is the _ relative intensity _ , defined as : @xmath17 where @xmath2 and @xmath18 are the observed intensities of the flaring and not flaring state respectively .    the equivalent duration ( @xmath19 ) is defined as :    @xmath20    the total energy of the flare ( @xmath21 ) is obtained by multiplying the equivalent duration by the system s luminosity .",
    "i.e. @xmath22erg ( where @xmath23 is the distance to the system and @xmath24 is the dereddened observed quiescent flux ) .",
    "the time - averaged flare luminosity @xmath25 is defined as the sum of the energies of the individual flares divided by the total monitoring time ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the system properties and the resulting parameters of the variability are summarized in tables  [ propiedades_v4 ] and  [ variabilidad_v4 ] respectively .",
    "+    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     @xcite reported that the accretion disc contributes 11 - 16 percent of the observed flux in @xmath5 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "therefore we assume an observational veiling of @xmath27 in this band .",
    "we also estimate an observational veiling of @xmath28 in the @xmath2 band by extrapolating from the veiling in @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath5 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite determined the fraction of the light arising from the accretion disc in the @xmath31 band varies from 0 to an upper limit of 11 percent .",
    "we hence consider @xmath32=5 percent in this case .",
    "the corrected values using these factors , are tabulated in table  [ veiling ] .",
    "the uncertainties on the veiling and the limited database only allows us to say that the activity diminishes slowly or remains approximately constant through the ir . in the 1992 series of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath5 and @xmath2 band observations ( 16 measurements spread over 16 nights ;",
    "see @xcite ) an estimate of the variability could be obtained by comparing the variance with the photometric noise and the optical variations .",
    "this variance increases toward the blue suggesting that the source of fast variability in v404 is indeed blue .",
    "we note however that @xcite determined the colour of the large flares and found the @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) band flux to be larger than that in the @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) band . comparing with these data we obtained an estimated spectrum with a peak at @xmath37(see fig .",
    "[ spec ] ) .",
    "+ in an attempt to compare the infrared variability we also observed the sxt with highest flares : j0422 + 32 , where events as high as 0.6 mag where observed ( zcs ) .",
    "observations of this system in the @xmath38 band covering half of its orbital period do not show variability above @xmath10.06mags , the estimated error of our photometry ( zurita et al . in preparation ) . comparing with the variability we observed in the @xmath39 band ( zcs ) and assuming that the disc contributes @xmath130% in @xmath38 ( beekman et al .",
    "1997 ) we estimate that the activity in the infrared is , at least , 33% lower than in the optical .",
    "although only a very crude estimation can be made , among other things because the observations are not simultaneous and because the value of the veiling is not well determined , it seems that the spectrum of j0422 + 32 flares also drop at longer wavelengths .",
    "on the other hand , no significant contamination of the infrared lightcurves of j0422 + 32 has been found by @xcite . + the quasi periodic oscillations noticed in the earliest data ( 1992 - see @xcite ) are less clear in our more recent data ( 1998 and 2001 ) . however , the periodograms show peaks close to 6hr at the 68 percent significance level which could be interpreted as a consequence of the appearance of a flare event almost every night .",
    "@xcite found a @xmath40 feature at 21.5minutes attributed to variability at the @xmath41 transition radius .",
    "our longer sampling does not allow us to test this hypothesis .",
    "it is possible in any case that variability with different timescales have different origin .",
