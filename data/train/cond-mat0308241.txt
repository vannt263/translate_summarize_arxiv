    "in recent years , there has been great interest in few - electron quantum dots , or so - called artificial atoms@xcite .",
    "the interest stems from a variety of fields , such as nano - electronics , spintronics , quantum computation , etc .",
    ", which are all rapidly growing at present .",
    "unlike usual atoms , the quantum dots can be locally manipulated by gates and tuned to the regimes of interest such that one same quantum dot can realize a whole species of atomic - like electronic structures ( artificial atoms ) . a great deal of experimental investigation on the kondo effect , coulomb blockade effect , spin blockade effect , etc .",
    ", has been performed in recent years owing to this tunability feature . yet",
    "not a less important feature of quantum dots is the possibility to architecture and control , to a great extent , the coupling to their surrounding , be it a dissipative environment , classical ( gate ) fields , or other quantum dots .",
    "this makes quantum dots attractive for quantum computation .",
    "a most promising candidate for qubit ( quantum bit ) in solid state is the electron spin@xcite .",
    "confining electrons to quantum dots naturally defines the qubit as the _ spin up _ and _ spin down _ states of the dot , provided the dot contains an odd number of electrons . at the ultimate level of control over the electron charge , the quantum dot can be tuned to confine one single electron@xcite , thus implementing the artificial version of the hydrogen atom .",
    "this has been successfully achieved in recent years , first in vertical dots@xcite and lately also in lateral dots@xcite , due to a special design of top gates .",
    "furthermore , observation of shell filling of dot orbitals and the hund s rule in symmetric dots@xcite indicates that the electron spin is a well defined and relevant degree of freedom in few - electron quantum dots and that achieving control over it should be feasible experimentally in the near future .    a very recent step forward in accessing the electron spin in quantum dots was made in refs .  and  , where the zeeman splitting of an electron in a lateral quantum dot has been measured directly by means of _ dc _ transport spectroscopy .",
    "resolution of the zeeman sublevels in a magnetic field @xmath3 allowed the authors of ref .   to measure the spin relaxation time @xmath4 for a single electron by means of a pulsed relaxation measurement technique .",
    "this technique  @xcite uses a sequence of pulses , which allow for sequential - tunneling into excited states of the quantum dot  @xcite .",
    "relaxation from such an excited state can be monitored in the average current versus the pulse timing , see refs .   and   for details .",
    "observation of an orbital relaxation time of @xmath5  @xcite and a @xmath4-time larger than @xmath6 at @xmath7  @xcite , illustrates the long - lived nature of the electron spin  @xcite .",
    "integrating qubits into a quantum computer is at present at the stage of realizing a two - qubit circuit . in the language of artificial atoms",
    "this translates to manipulating a hydrogen molecule . here",
    ", the spins on two dots interact with the heisenberg exchange interaction @xmath8 , where @xmath9 are spin @xmath10 operators , and @xmath11 is the exchange coupling constant . achieving control over the coupling constant",
    "@xmath11 is as important for the qubit as controlling its zeeman energy for spin quantization along two independent axes .",
    "the latter allows for arbitrary single - spin rotations on the bloch sphere , whereas a combination of the exchange interaction and single - spin rotations@xcite allows one to create non - local quantum - mechanical correlations between the qubits , often referred to as _",
    "entanglement_. moreover , as demonstrated in ref .  , the exchange interaction together with single - spin rotations suffices for universal quantum computation .",
    "the challenge of implementing an artificial @xmath12 molecule has been met in recent works , see refs . and . in typical structures ,",
    "transport measurements alone do not always give reliable information about the number of electrons on each dot .",
    "the current through the double dot ( dd ) is often too small to be measured and the tunnel contacts are likely to be pinched off in the few - electron regime , due to a high level of depletion in the dot region caused by the electrostatic potential of the gates .",
    "a complementary method of charge control was used in ref .  , which came with integrating the quantum dots with sensitive charge detectors  @xcite  quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) placed nearby the quantum dots and tuned to half pinch off .",
    "such a charge detector is capable of sensing a change in the dot occupation number by as much as a fraction of an electron  @xcite .",
    "using this method of charge control should allow one to concentrate in more detail on the transport properties of the dd . as we show in this paper , the differential conductance of the dd as a function of the bias voltage provides valuable information about the dd parameters , including the exchange constant @xmath11 .",
    "we begin with a hund - mulliken model for the dd in section  [ sechundmul ] .",
    "we introduce the parameters which characterize the dd .",
    "next , throughout the paper , we refer to these parameters as phenomenological ones , seeking ways to extract them from possible experiments . in section  [ sequential ] , we use a master equation approach and derive the sequential - tunneling current @xmath13 at a finite bias voltage @xmath1 . here , we find a novel feature for the dd : the differential conductance @xmath14 as a function of @xmath1 has a peak of _ negative _ @xmath0 for typical dd parameters . we find a number of additional peaks , which all together allow one to extract the exchange constant @xmath11 and the dd tunnel splitting @xmath15 . in section  [ cotunnelingn=1 ] , we consider cotunneling through a coulomb blockaded dd with one electron .",
    "we calculate the elastic and inelastic components of the current and specify a temperature regime of _ strong heating _ , where the asymmetry of the coupling to the leads , @xmath16 , can be extracted from transport measurements .",
    "the procedure is explained in detail in section  [ cotunnelingn=2 ] , where we consider the cotunneling through the coulomb blockaded dd with two electrons .",
    "we show that the _ interaction _ parameter @xmath17 , which gives the hubbard ratio and entanglement between the electrons in the dd singlet state , can be extracted from transport measurements .",
    "finally , in section  [ together ] , we consider a combined effect of sequential tunneling and cotunneling for the dd . here , again we find additional peaks or dips , which can occur in the coulomb blockaded valleys for the non - linear conductance below certain temperature scales , which we specify .",
    "for definiteness we consider lateral quantum dots , which are usually formed by gating a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) under the surface of a substrate .",
    "the 2deg is depleted in the regions under the gates and , with an appropriate gate design@xcite , one can achieve a depopulation of the dots down to 1 and 0 electrons per dot , avoiding pinching of the dots from the rest of the 2deg .",
    "the low energy sector of a dd at occupation number @xmath18 consists of two tunnel - split energy levels , which we label by the orbital quantum number @xmath19 , with @xmath20 standing for the symmetric orbital and @xmath21 for the anti - symmetric one .",
    "the states of the dd with one electron can then be written as @xmath22 denotes the spin degeneracy of each level ( we neglect the zeeman splitting ) , @xmath23 is the electron creation operator , and @xmath24 is the dd state with zero electrons .",
    "the splitting between the two levels is given by @xmath15 , where @xmath25 is the interdot tunneling amplitude .",
    "we assume weak tunnel - coupling between the dots such that @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the size - quantization energy of a single dot .",
    "then , for the occupation number @xmath28 , the lowest energy states , one singlet state and 3 triplet states are given by @xmath29 the splitting between the singlet and the triplet , @xmath30 , plays the role of the heisenberg exchange interaction for the two electron spins in the dd , @xmath8 .",
    "the _ interaction _",
    "parameter @xmath17 , entering the singlet state in ( [ states ] ) , is determined by a competition between tunneling and coulomb interaction in the dd , and it can be calculated@xcite ( hund - mulliken method ) to be @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the so called extended inter - dot tunneling amplitude and on - site coulomb repulsion , respectively  @xcite .",
    "we note that @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a coulomb contribution , which vanishes with detaching the dots ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "to illustrate the meaning of @xmath17 , we also present the states ( [ states ] ) in terms of orbitals , which are mostly localized on one of the dots , see appendix  a. the double occupancy in the singlet state is given by @xmath37 the parameter @xmath17 also determines the entanglement between the two electrons in the singlet state .",
    "while @xmath17 can be used on its own as a measure of entanglement , we are presenting here a formula for the concurrence  @xcite of the singlet @xmath38 , @xmath39 the entanglement in the @xmath40 state is maximal ( @xmath41 ) at all values of @xmath25 .",
    "the energies of the considered dd states are given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 , with @xmath45 being the energy shift due to the common gate potential @xmath46 ( see fig .",
    "[ ddsetup ] ) and @xmath47 the mutual capacitance between the dots .    for small dots ( @xmath48 ) ,",
    "the next excited states are the following two singlets @xmath49 with @xmath50 . the states ( [ states ] ) together with ( [ pure ] ) and ( [ out ] )",
    "complete the resolution of unity for two electrons in the dd orbitals @xmath51 .",
    "finally , we note that according to the hund - mulliken method the exchange constant @xmath11 consists of two components , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is responsible for a singlet - triplet transition at a finite magnetic field , see ref .  , and @xmath54 resembles the exchange constant obtained in the standard hubbard model for on - site coulomb repulsion . for weakly coupled quantum dots",
    ", we have @xmath55 .",
    "the setup we are considering is shown in fig .",
    "[ ddsetup]_a_. each dot is tunnel - coupled to a metallic lead via a point contact , forming a series lead - dot - dot - lead setup [ for a parallel configuration see refs .   and  ] .",
    "the point contact in lateral structures has a smooth ( wave - guide - like ) potential , providing a number of lead modes ( channels ) that can couple to the dot . by constraining the point contact ,",
    "the lead modes can be pinched off one by one , due to the transverse quantization in the contact region .",
    "when the last mode in each point contact is about to be pinched off , the structure shows coulomb blockade ( cb ) effect at low temperatures . in this regime ,",
    "the point contacts can be treated as tunnel junctions , with tunneling amplitudes @xmath56 and @xmath57 , for the left and right dot , respectively .",
    "the leads are then single - channel fermi - liquid leads , which we describe by the hamiltonian @xmath58 where @xmath59 creates an electron with momentum @xmath60 ( energy @xmath61 ) and spin @xmath62 in lead @xmath63",
    ". the tunneling between the dd and the leads is described by the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath64 with the tunneling amplitudes : @xmath65 here , @xmath66 is the overlap integral between the two dots orbital wave functions ( @xmath67 ) . formulas ( [ tunamp ] ) account for the hybridization of the dd orbitals at @xmath68 with the accuracy of the method of molecular orbitals ( hund - mulliken method ) .",
    "the tunnel - coupling to the leads broadens the dd levels @xmath51 , introducing the level width @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the lead density of states per spin . for our convenience",
    ", we also use the notations : @xmath71 , with @xmath63 , and @xmath72 . throughout the paper , we assume @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the temperature .",
    "the usual cb stability diagram@xcite for a dd represents a honeycomb structure of increased linear conductance plotted versus @xmath75 , @xmath76  the gate voltages controlling each of the two dots , respectively .",
    "we are interested in the case when the two dots are similar , and therefore consider the diagonal of the stability diagram , @xmath77 , in the vicinity of ( 1,1)-(1,0)-(0,1 ) triple point .",
