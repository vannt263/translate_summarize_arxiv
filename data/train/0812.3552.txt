    "the classical big bang singularity is also replaced by a quantum bounce .",
    "the most interestingly , this new scheme introduces a novel quantum singularity . at this quantum singularity",
    "the hubble parameter diverges , but the universe can evolve through it regularly , which is different from the case for the classical big bang singularity . in order to investigate the novel quantum singularity in this @xmath0 scheme , we apply it to the universe filled with a tachyon field and compared the result with the classical dynamics and the @xmath1 scheme which is presented in our previous paper @xcite .",

    "we investigate the tachyon field in the effective framework of lqc . according to sen @xcite , in a spatially flat frw cosmology",
    "the hamiltonian for the tachyon field can be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the conjugate momentum for the tachyon field @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the potential term for the tachyon field , and @xmath7 is the frw scale factor .",

    "[ fig1 ] we compare the different behavior of the hubble parameter versus the energy density of the matter .",

    ", we can see clearly the bounce behavior at @xmath40 .",
    "when @xmath44 the universe meets a superinflation phase ( @xmath45 ) . when @xmath46 becomes small , the universe behaves as the standard picture . while for the @xmath0 scheme",
    ", the bounce happens at @xmath47 .",
    "when @xmath48 , the universe meets a superinflation phase . in the region where @xmath46 is small , the hubble parameter of the @xmath0 scheme is smaller than the one of the standard cosmology . in this sense",
    "the universe of the @xmath0 scheme expands slower than the universe of the standard cosmology .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we compare the different behavior of @xmath49 in the expanding universe ( taking `` - '' in eqs .",
    "( [ ddotphi_cl])-([ddotphi_4 ] ) ) , in the phase space , i.e. , @xmath50-@xmath5 space .",
    "firstly , from the upper three subfigures , we can see that the quantum correction in the @xmath1 scheme of lqc changes the amplitude of classical @xmath49 very small , while in contrast , the quantum correction in the @xmath0 scheme changes this amplitude significantly .",
    "besides , the quantum correction in the @xmath1 scheme changes obviously the line shapes for iso-@xmath49 , while the quantum correction in the @xmath0 scheme changes the line shapes negligibly .",
    "this difference results from the different locations of the bounce region .",
    "in fact , the quantum effect is the strongest in the bounce region for different quantum corrections .",
    "the region shown in these three upper subfigures is near the bounce region for the @xmath1 scheme while some far away from the bounce region of the @xmath0 scheme .",
    "secondly , in the lower three subfigures , we compare the quantum correction from @xmath0 of lqc with the classical behavior .",
    "we see that the behavior of @xmath49 near the singularity region is changed completely .",
    "@xmath49 diverges when the state approaches the singularity line ( the contour line of @xmath51 ) except for one point @xmath52 where @xmath53 . yet near the bounce region , the behavior of @xmath49 is similar to the one of the @xmath1 scheme in its corresponding bounce region .",
    "in the original paper @xcite , the authors provided qualitative analysis of the dynamics for lqc in the @xmath0 scheme .",
    "take the advantage of the specific model of the universe coupled with the tachyon field , we can investigate this dynamics for lqc quantitatively , and compare the difference between the classical , the @xmath1 scheme and the @xmath0 scheme dynamics .",
    "we solve the equations ( [ ddotphi_cl ] ) , ( [ ddotphi_2 ] ) and ( [ ddotphi_4 ] ) with the rung - kutta subroutine .",
    "the result is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    for the @xmath0 scheme ,",
    "the difference between the classical and the quantum behaviors is more explicit in the region between the bouncing boundary and the singularity line . while the difference in the region on the right - hand side of singularity is negligible .",
    "note that the admissible states for the @xmath1 scheme all locate in this region .",
    "so we can imagine that the difference between the @xmath0 scheme and the @xmath1 scheme is nothing but the difference between the classical one and the @xmath1 one , which is presented in figs . 1 and 2 of our previous paper @xcite .",
    "near the bounce region , the quantum behavior is similar for both the @xmath1 scheme and the @xmath0 scheme .",
    "certainly , this behavior emerges at different places in @xmath54-@xmath5 space for the @xmath1 scheme and the @xmath0 scheme respectively . near the singularity region",
    ", there is not special respects for the quantum evolution in the @xmath55-@xmath5 space , except that the quantum trajectories are much steeper than the classical ones .",
    "this steeper behavior is resulted from the singularity behavior of the quantum dynamics which makes @xmath49 much larger than the original classical ones . from the right panel of fig.[fig3 ] , we can see that both the hyper - inflationary and deflationary phases of the universe emerged clearly .",
    "the universe expands increasingly faster before singularity untill the acceleration becomes infinity .",
    "this stage corresponds to the hyper - inflationary phase for the universe .",
    "after this singularity , the universe expands more and more slowly .",
    "the behavior comes back to the classical one @xcite quickly .",
    "this stage is the deflationary phase for the universe .",
    "as a dynamical system , ( [ ddotphi_4 ] ) is singular when @xmath56 , which corresponds to the right ",
    "c \" shaped curve of the left panel of fig .",
    "that means that the dynamical system is only defined in two separated regions .",
    "one is the region between the left ",
    "c \" shaped line and the right  c \" shaped line , and the another is the region on the right - hand side of the right ",
    "c \" shaped line . then a question arises naturally  does the numerical behavior traversing the separated  c \" shaped line make sense or is it only a numerical cheating ?",
    "if we consider these two regions separately the dynamical system is well defined in the sense of the cauchy uniqueness theorem .",
    "the orbits in the phase space @xmath57-@xmath54 are smooth . taking the phase space as @xmath58 ,",
    "these orbits are smooth curves .",
    "so these smooth curves have proper limit points on the separated  c \" shaped line . from the numerical solutions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we can see that the different orbits have different limit points on the  c \" shaped line .",
    "this is because the vector flow generating the trajectories ( on the @xmath57-@xmath54 plane ) has well - defined directions ( vertical ) at the singularity , which means the trajectories can not intersect there .",
    "then it is natural to join the two orbits in the two separated regions with the same limit points . in this way",
    "we get a well - defined dynamical system in the total region which lies on the right - hand side of the left",
    " c \" shaped line .",
    "we can expect the numerical solution with the rung - kutta method will converge to this solution ( we also performed numerical integrations starting from both sides towards the singular point and obtained the same result ) .",
    "so the numerical result presented in the above sections does make sense .    in the following ,",
    "we come back to the spacetime to check the property of this traversable singularity .",
    "corresponding to the two separated regions of phase space @xmath57-@xmath54 , the scale factor @xmath7 can be determined by @xmath57 and @xmath54 through @xmath59 which is a smooth function of @xmath57 and @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , the two spacetime regions of the universe corresponding to these two regions is smooth .",
    "when the universe evolves to @xmath56 , @xmath7 is also well defined through ( [ determinea ] ) .",
    "that implies that the whole spacetime of the universe is well defined through joining the above mentioned two regions together by the well - defined @xmath7 at @xmath56 .",
    "but since @xmath49 is singular there , @xmath60 is also singular there , which makes the spacetime of the universe unsmooth . in this sense",
    "the spatial slice corresponding to this special universe time is a traversable singularity of the spacetime .    according to @xcite",
    ", singularities can be classified into strong and weak types .",
    "a singularity is strong if the tidal forces cause complete destruction of the objects irrespective of their physical characteristics , whereas a singularity is considered weak if the tidal forces are not strong enough to forbid the passage of objects . in this classification",
    "the singularity discussed here is only a weak singularity . as to the cosmological singularities",
    ", they can be classified in more details with the triplet of variables ( @xmath61 ) @xcite : big bang and big crunch ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 and curvature invariants diverge at a finite proper time ) ; big rip or type i singularity ( @xmath7 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and curvature invariants diverge at a finite proper time ) ; sudden or type ii singularity ( @xmath7 and @xmath63 are finite while @xmath64 diverges ) ; type iii singularity ( @xmath7 is finite while @xmath63 and @xmath64 diverge ) ; type iv singularity ( @xmath7 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and the curvature invariants are finite while the curvature derivatives diverge ) . for the singularity discussed in this paper , @xmath7 , @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    "are all finite because of the regularity of @xmath57 and @xmath54 at the singularity .",
    "but the ricci curvature invariant , @xmath65 diverges at the singularity .",
    "so the singularity here does not fall in any type of above clarification .",
    "but it is more similar to type iv singularity than to the other types .",
    "in the classical cosmology our universe has a big bang singularity .",
    "all physical laws break down there .",
    "lqc replaces this singularity with a quantum bounce and the universe can evolve through the bounce point regularly .",
    "considering the quantum ambiguity of quantization scheme in lqc , the authors in @xcite proposed a new scheme .",
    "in addition to the quantum bounce , a novel quantum singularity emerges in this new scheme .",
    "the quantum singularity is different from the big bang singularity and is traversable , although the hubble parameter diverges at this singularity . in this paper , we follow our previous work @xcite to investigate this novel dynamics with the tachyon scalar field in the framework of the effective lqc .",
    "we analyze the evolution of the tachyon field with an exponential potential in the context of lqc , and obviously , any other choice of potential can lead to the similar result .    in the high energy region",
    "( approaching the critical density @xmath66 ) , lqc in the new quantization scheme greatly modifies the classical frw cosmology and predicts a nonsingular bounce at density @xmath67 , which is located at a different density region compared with the @xmath1 quantization scheme .",
    "in addition , besides this quantum bounce , this new quantization scheme also introduces a quantum singularity , which emerges at density @xmath68 . at this quantum singularity",
    "the hubble parameter diverges . but",
    "this singularity is different from the classical one .",
    "the universe can evolve through this quantum singularity regularly .",
    "different from the @xmath1 scheme , the dynamics of the new quantization scheme will deviates from the classical one even in a small energy density region ( see fig .",
