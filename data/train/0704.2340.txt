    "during the last decade , many radioactive beam facilities have become available in the world . at these facilities ,",
    "nuclear reactions involving nuclei with large neutron or proton excess can be studied , providing the opportunities to study the properties of nuclear matter under the extreme condition of large isospin asymmetry .",
    "this has led to a lot of interests and activities in a new research direction in nuclear physics , namely the isospin physics .",
    "the ultimate goal of studying isospin physics is to extract information on the isospin dependence of in - medium nuclear effective interactions as well as the equation of state ( eos ) of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter , particularly its isospin - dependent term , i.e. , the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "there are already extensive reviews on the isospin physics in nuclear physics , and they can be found in , e.g. , refs.@xcite .",
    "knowledge about the nuclear symmetry energy extracted from the eos of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter is essential in understanding not only many aspects of nuclear physics , such as heavy - ion collisions induced by radioactive nuclei and the structure of exotic nuclei , but also a number of important issues in astrophysics , such as nucleosynthesis during pre - supernova evolution of massive stars and the cooling of protoneutron stars .",
    "although the nuclear symmetry energy at normal nuclear matter density is known to be around @xmath0 mev from the empirical liquid - drop mass formula @xcite , its values at other densities , especially at supra - normal densities , are poorly known @xcite .",
    "predictions based on various many - body theories differ widely at both low and high densities @xcite .",
    "empirically , the incompressibility of asymmetric nuclear matter is essentially undetermined @xcite , even though the incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter at its saturation density @xmath1 @xmath2 has been determined to be @xmath3 mev from nuclear giant monopole resonances ( gmr ) @xcite and the eos at densities of @xmath4 has also been constrained by measurements of collective flows in nucleus - nucleus collisions dan02a .",
    "theoretical studies of the eos of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter were started by brueckner _",
    "_ @xcite and siemens @xcite in the late 60 s .",
    "since then , there have been many studies on this subject based on different many - body theories using various two - body and three - body forces or interaction lagrangians .",
    "these many - body theories provide very useful tools for understanding the properties of hot and dense nuclear matter , and they can be roughly classified into three categories : the microscopic many - body approach , the effective - field theory approach , and the phenomenological approach . in the microscopic many - body approach ,",
    "the nuclear many - body problem is treated microscopically using nucleon - nucleon interactions fitted to high - precision experimental data and is thus free of parameters .",
    "the microscopic many - body approach mainly includes the non - relativistic brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) approach @xcite , relativistic dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) approach mut87,har87,sum92,hub93,fuc04,ma04,sam05a , self - consistent green s function approach @xcite , and variational many - body approach @xcite . in the effective - field theory approach ,",
    "an effective interaction is constructed based on the effective - field theory ( eft ) , leading to a systematic expansion of the eos in powers of density ( the fermi momentum ) .",
    "the effective - field theory approach can be based on the density functional theory @xcite or on chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "since this approach can be linked to low energy qcd and its symmetry breaking , it has the advantage of small number of free parameters and a correspondingly higher predictive power .",
    "the phenomenological approach is based on effective density - dependent nuclear forces or effective interaction lagrangians . in these approaches ,",
    "a number of parameters have to be adjusted to fit the properties of many nuclei .",
    "this type of models mainly includes the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) theory @xcite , relativistic and non - relativistic hartree - fock mil74,bro78,jam81,hor83,bou87,lop88,ber93,wer94,kho96,vau72,bra85,sto07 or thomas - fermi approximations @xcite .",
    "these phenomenological approaches allow the most precise description for the properties of finite nuclei .",
    "both the phenomenological and eft approaches contain parameters that are fixed by nuclear properties around the saturation density and thus usually give excellent descriptions for the nuclear properties around or below the saturation density .",
    "their predictions at the high density region are , however , probably unreliable . in addition , due to different approximations or techniques used in different microscopic many - body approaches , their predictions on the properties of nuclear matter could be very different even for the same bare nucleon - nucleon interaction @xcite .",
    "in particular , predictions on the properties of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter , especially the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy , are still significantly different for different many - body theory approaches .",
    "fortunately , heavy - ion reactions induced by radioactive beams provide a unique opportunity to investigate in terrestrial laboratories the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter , particularly the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy . during the past decade",
    ", a large amount of theoretical and experimental efforts have been devoted to the study of the properties of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter via heavy - ion reactions @xcite . to extract information about the eos of neutron - rich matter , especially the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy , from heavy - ion reactions induced by radioactive beams",
    ", one needs reliable theoretical tools .",
    "transport models that include explicit isospin - dependent degrees of freedom are especially useful for understanding the role of isospin degree of freedom in the dynamics of central nuclear reactions induced by neutron nuclei at intermediate and high energies and in extracting information about the eos of produced neutron - rich matter . during past two decades , significant progresses",
    "have been made in developing semi - classical transport models for nuclear reactions .",
    "these semi - classical models mainly include the following two types : the boltzmann - uehling - ulenbeck ( buu ) model @xcite and the quantum molecular dynamical ( qmd ) model @xcite .",
    "while it is important to develop practically implementable quantum transport theories , applications of the semi - classical transport models have enabled us to learn a great deal of interesting physics from heavy - ion reactions . in particular , with the development of the radioactive nuclear beam physics , some isospin - dependent transport models @xcite have been successfully developed in recent years to describe the nuclear reactions induced by neutron nuclei at intermediate and high energies .    in studying the properties of asymmetric nuclear matter from heavy - ion reactions induced by neutron - rich nuclei ,",
    "a key task is to identify experimental observables that are sensitive to the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy , especially at high densities .",
    "because of the fact that the symmetry potentials for neutrons and protons have opposite signs and that they are generally weaker than the nuclear isoscalar potential at same density , most observables proposed so far use differences or ratios of isospin multiplets of baryons , mirror nuclei and mesons , such as the neutron / proton ratio of nucleon emissions @xcite , neutron - proton differential flow @xcite , neutron - proton correlation function @xcite , @xmath5/@xmath6he @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath9 ratios @xcite , etc .. in addition , in order to reduce the systematical errors , multiple probes taken from several reaction systems using different isotopes of the same element have also been proposed .",
    "these multiple probes mainly include double ratio or double differential flow .",
    "indeed , recent experimental and theoretical analysis of the isospin diffusion data from heavy - ion reactions has led to significant progress in determining the nuclear symmetry energy at subnormal densities @xcite .",
    "based on the same underlying skyrme interactions as the ones constrained by the isospin diffusion data , the neutron - skin thickness in @xmath10pb calculated within the hartree - fock approach is consistent with available experimental data @xcite .",
    "this symmetry energy is also consistent with that from a relativistic mean - field model using an accurately calibrated parameter set that reproduces both the giant monopole resonance in @xmath11zr and @xmath10pb , and the isovector giant dipole resonance of @xmath10pb @xcite .",
    "it further agrees with the symmetry energy recently obtained from isoscaling analyses of isotope ratios in intermediate - energy heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "these different studies have provided so far the best phenomenological constraints on the symmetry energy at sub - normal densities .",
    "information on the symmetry energy at supra - normal densities , on the other hand , remains inclusive and more efforts are needed to investigate the supra - normal density behavior of the symmetry energy .",
    "heavy - ion collisions induced by future high energy radioactive beams to be available at high energy radioactive beam facilities will provide a unique opportunity for determining the symmetry energy at supra - normal densities .",
    "in the present paper , we review recent progress on the determination of the nuclear symmetry energy in heavy - ion reactions induced by neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "in particular , we review the exciting results on density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy at subnormal densities determined from recent analysis of the isospin diffusion data in heavy - ion reactions . we also discuss the implications derived from this new information on nuclear effective interactions and the neutron skin thickness of heavy nuclei .",
    "in addition , we review theoretical progress in studying the behavior of nuclear symmetry energy at high density from heavy - ion reactions induced by high energy radioactive beams .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ esym ]",
    ", we give a brief introduction to the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "we then describe in section ibuu04 the ibuu04 hadron transport model for nuclear reactions induced by radioactive beams at intermediate energies . in section [ diffusion ] , we present the results from the ibuu04 model analysis of the isospin diffusion data in heavy - ion reactions and discuss the stringent constraint they have imposed on the nuclear symmetry energy around the nuclear matter saturation density . based on the constrained symmetry energy from the isospin diffusion data , we discuss in section [ skyrmenskin ] the implications of the isospin diffusion data on nuclear effective interactions and the neutron skin thickness of heavy nuclei . in section [ highdensity ] ,",
    "we review theoretical progress on studying the behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy at high density in heavy - ion reactions induced by high energy radioactive beams .",
    "finally , a summary is given in section [ summary ] .",
    "in the parabolic approximation that has been verified by all many - body theories to date , the eos of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter can be written as @xmath12where @xmath13 is the baryon density with @xmath14 and @xmath15 denoting the neutron and proton densities , respectively ; @xmath16 is the isospin asymmetry ; @xmath17 is the energy per nucleon in symmetric nuclear matter , and @xmath18is the nuclear symmetry energy . in eq .",
    "( [ esympara ] ) , there are no odd - order @xmath19 terms due to the exchange symmetry of the proton and neutron in the nuclear matter ( the charge symmetry of nuclear forces ) .",
    "higher - order terms in @xmath19 are negligible . for example , the magnitude of the @xmath20 term at @xmath21 has been estimated to be less than @xmath22 mev @xcite . as a good approximation",
    ", the density dependent symmetry energy @xmath23 can thus be extracted from @xmath24 which implies that the symmetry energy @xmath25 is the energy cost to convert all protons in a symmetric nuclear matter to neutrons at the fixed density @xmath26 .    around the nuclear matter saturation density @xmath21 ,",
    "the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath23  can be further expanded to second - order as @xmath27where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the slope and curvature parameters of the nuclear symmetry energy at @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath30the @xmath28 and @xmath29 characterize the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy around normal nuclear matter density , and thus provide important information on properties of the nuclear symmetry energy at both high and low densities .",
    "at the nuclear matter saturation density @xmath21 and around @xmath31 , the isobaric incompressibility of asymmetric nuclear matter can be further expressed as @xcite @xmath32where @xmath33 is the incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter at the nuclear matter saturation density @xmath21 and the isospin - dependent part @xmath34 @xcite characterizes the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy . in principle , the information on @xmath35 can be extracted experimentally by measuring the gmr of neutron - rich nuclei and a constraint of @xmath36 mev has been extracted earlier from a systematic study on the gmr of finite nuclei depending on the mass region of nuclei and the number of parameters used in parameterizing the incompressibility of finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "the large uncertainties in the extracted @xmath35 thus does not allow us to distinguish the different nuclear symmetry energies in theoretical models .",
    "information about the nuclear symmetry energy is important not only for nuclear physics , but also for a number of important issues in astrophysics .",
    "for example , the prompt shock invoked to understand the explosion mechanism of a type ii supernova requires a relatively soft eos @xcite , which can be understood in terms of the dependence of the nuclear incompressibility on isospin . in the model for prompt explosion @xcite , the electron - capture reaction drives the star in the latest stage of collapse to an equilibrium state where the proton concentration is about @xmath37 , which , according to microscopic many - body calculations , reduces the nuclear matter incompressibility by about @xmath38 compared to that for symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "moreover , the magnitude of proton concentration at @xmath39 equilibrium in a neutron star is almost entirely determined by the symmetry energy .",
    "the proton fraction affects not only the stiffness of the eos but also the cooling mechanisms of neutron stars @xcite and the possibility of kaon condensation ( @xmath40 ) in dense stellar matter @xcite .",
    "if the proton concentration is larger than a critical value of about @xmath41 , the direct urca process @xmath42 becomes possible , and would then enhance the emission of neutrinos , making it a more important process in the cooling of a neutron star @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the density dependence of @xmath43 , especially its high density behavior , is poorly known and is regarded as the most uncertain among all properties of an isospin asymmetric nuclear matter . even around the saturation density ,",
    "values of the parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath35 are still very uncertain with different theoretical models giving very different predictions .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ piekesym ] where we show the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy from some of the most widely used microscopic many - body theories @xcite .",
    "one sees that the theoretical predictions diverge widely at both low and high densities .",
    "in fact , even the sign of the symmetry energy above @xmath44 is uncertain @xcite .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties are largely due to a lack of knowledge about the isospin dependence of nuclear effective interactions and the limitations in the techniques in solving the nuclear many - body problem .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , heavy - ion reactions , especially those induced by radioactive beams , provide a unique opportunity to pin down the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy in terrestrial laboratories .",
    "indeed , significant progress has been made recently both experimentally and theoretically in determining the symmetry energy at subnormal densities . at sub - normal densities ,",
    "a density - dependent symmetry energy of @xmath45 has been found to best reproduce both the isospin diffusion @xcite and isoscaling @xcite data in heavy - ion collisions as well as the presently acceptable neutron - skin thickness in @xmath10pb @xcite .",
    "together , these results represent the best phenomenological constraints available so far on the symmetry energy at sub - normal densities .",
    "although the high density behavior of the symmetry energy remain largely undetermined , future high energy radioactive beams to be available at high energy radioactive beam facilities will allow us to determine the symmetry energy at supra - normal densities .",
    "transport models are useful theoretical tools not only for studying the reaction mechanisms but also for extracting information on the properties of produced hot dense matter in heavy ion collisions",
    ". for nuclear reactions induced by radioactive beams , comparing experimental data with transport model calculations allows us to extract the information about the eos of neutron - rich matter .",

    "the high density phase lasts for about 15 fm / c from 5 to 20 fm / c for this reaction .",
    "the isospin asymmetry of the high density region is , however , sensitive to the symmetry energy .",
    "the soft ( e.g. , @xmath107 ) symmetry energy leads to a significantly higher value of @xmath108 than the stiff one ( e.g. , @xmath109 ) .",

    "the difference between the @xmath8 ratio and the @xmath7 ratio can be understood from the fact that , like nucleons , @xmath231 hyperons are under the influence of the mean field produced by the surrounding nucleons , as soon as they are produced .",
    "the symmetry potential of hyperons thus play an important dynamic role and results in a strong effect on the ratio of the negatively to positively charged @xmath232 hyperons .",
    "heavy - ion collisions induced by neutron - rich nuclei provides a unique opportunity for investigating the properties of the isospin asymmetric nuclear matter , especially the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy . to extract useful information from these collisions ,",
    "transport models have been found to be extremely useful .",
    "applications of these models have helped us understand not only the isospin dependence of the in - medium nuclear effective interactions but also that of the thermal , mechanical and transport properties of asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "these information , particularly the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy , are very important for both nuclear physics and astrophysics .",
    "significant progress has been made in recent years in determining the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "based on transport model calculations , a number of sensitive probes of the symmetry energy have been identified . in particular ,",
    "the momentum dependence in both the isoscalar and isovector parts of the nuclear potential was found to play an important role in extracting accurately the density dependence of the symmetry energy . from comparison of results from the transport model with recent experimental data on isospin diffusion from nscl / msu , a symmetry energy of @xmath233 with @xmath234 at subnormal densities , which corresponds to the isospin and momentum dependent mdi interaction with @xmath137 and @xmath72 , has been extracted .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with those extracted from studying other observables such as the isoscaling data and the neutron - skin thickness in @xmath10pb .",
    "although considerable progress has been made in determining the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy at sub - normal densities , probing the high density behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy remains a major challenge .",
    "our current knowledge on the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy can be seen from fig .",
    "[ esymcurrent ] , where predictions from several typical theoretical model @xcite are compared with the phenomenological constraints that have been obtained from model analysis of experimental data .",
    "the constraints labeled @xmath137 and @xmath138 were extracted from studying the isospin diffusion in the reaction of @xmath89sn + @xmath132sn at @xmath235 amev within an isospin and momentum dependent transport model @xcite . for this particular reaction ,",
    "the maximum density reached is about @xmath143 .",
    "moreover , it was shown that the neutron - skin thickness in @xmath10pb calculated within the hartree - fock approach using the same underlying skyrme interactions as the ones labeled @xmath137 and @xmath138 is consistent with the available experimental data @xcite . the symmetry energy labeled as fsu - gold was calculated within a rmf model using an accurately calibrated parameter set such that it reproduces both the giant monopole resonance in @xmath11zr and @xmath10pb as well as the isovector giant dipole resonance of @xmath10pb @xcite .",
    "we note that the constraint obtained from the isoscaling analysis is also consistent with the fsu - gold and the @xmath137 case @xcite . at present , these results represent the best phenomenological constraints on the nuclear symmetry energy at sub - normal densities .    although all predicted nuclear symmetry energies shown in fig .",
    "[ esymcurrent ] are close to the existing constraints at low densities , they diverge widely at supra - normal densities , including those from the mdi interaction with @xmath138 and that with @xmath137 as well as the fsu - gold .",
    "since there are currently no experimental constraints on the high density behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy , more work is thus needed .",
    "in particular , experimental data including neutrons from reactions with neutron - rich beams in a broad energy range will be useful for studying the behavior of the symmetry energy at high densities .",
    "we have reviewed recent theoretical progress in identifying the observables in heavy - ion collisions induced by high energy radioactive nuclei that are sensitive to the high density behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "a plethora of potentially sensitive probes have been found , and they include the @xmath147 ratio , isospin fractionation , n - p differential flow , double n / p and @xmath7 ratio , double n - p differential transverse flow as well as the @xmath9 and @xmath8 ratios . studying these observable in future experiments at high energy radioactive beam facilities",
    "is expected to lead to significant constraints on the behavior of the symmetry energy at supra - normal densities .",
    "since transport models are essential in extracting these constraints from the experimental data , the continuous development of a practically implementable quantum transport theory for nuclear reactions induced by radioactive beams is important but poses a great challenge .",
