    "in condensed matter physics , many researches have focused on low - temperature physics .",
    "superconductivity , anderson localization , superfluidity , metal - insulator transition , and kondo effect are typical low - temperature physics .",
    "in contrast , studies on high - temperature physics are fewer in number at present .",
    "recently , magnetic oxides have been studied extensively as a possible candidate for thermoelectric materials at high temperatures since the discovery of large thermopower in naco@xmath6o@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the high thermoelectric performance of naco@xmath6o@xmath7 is currently explained in terms of a large degeneracy of spin and orbital degrees of freedom of co@xmath5 ions @xcite .",
    "therefore , control of spin and orbital states of magnetic ions would improve the performance of thermoelectric oxides . in this sense",
    ", thermoelectrics can be a new research direction in magnetics .",
    "we hope that new physical phenomena such as the good thermoelectricity in naco@xmath6o@xmath7 might exist in magnetic materials at high temperatures . here",
    "we have paid attention to the transport properties of mn oxides , where a complicated electron - spin - phonon interaction induces an exotic electric conduction such as colossal magnetoresistance .",
    "we have measured their resistivity and thermopower up to 1000 k , and have found that they are essentially independent of carrier density and crystal structure in the high temperature limit .",
    "this is quite anomalous in the sense that thermopower and resistivity usually depend on carrier density and crystal structure for conventional metals and semiconductors .",
    "polycrystalline samples of ca(mn@xmath8cu@xmath9)mn@xmath7o@xmath10 ( @xmath11 0 , 0.25 , 0.5 , 0.75 and 1 ) and limn@xmath6o@xmath7 were prepared by a solid - state reaction .",
    "stoichiometric amounts of caco@xmath12 , mn@xmath12o@xmath7 , cuo , and li@xmath6co@xmath12 were mixed , and the mixture was calcined at 900@xmath13c for 12 h for camn@xmath12mn@xmath7o@xmath10 , 870@xmath13c for 12 h for ca(mn@xmath8cu@xmath9)mn@xmath7o@xmath10 ( @xmath140 ) , and 800@xmath13c for 24 h for limn@xmath6o@xmath7 .",
    "the product was finely ground , pressed into a pellet , and sintered at 950@xmath13c for 72 h for camn@xmath12mn@xmath7o@xmath10 , 930@xmath13c for 12 h for ca(mn@xmath8cu@xmath9)mn@xmath7o@xmath10 ( @xmath140 ) , and 850@xmath13c for 24 h for limn@xmath6o@xmath7 .",
    "all the samples were calcined in air .",
    "single crystals of pr@xmath15ca@xmath15mno@xmath12 were grown using the traveling solvent floating zone method .",
    "stoichiometric amounts of pr@xmath16o@xmath17 , caco@xmath12 , and mno@xmath6 were mixed , and the mixture was calcined at 1200@xmath13c for 8h in air .",
    "the calcined powder was ground , placed into a rubber tube and then hydrostatically pressed under 2000 kg/@xmath18 .",
    "the pressed rod was sintered at 1350@xmath13c for 12 h in air .",
    "the feed and seed rods were rotated in opposite directions at a relative rate of 40 rpm and the melted zone was vertically scanned at a speed of 7 mm / h .",
    "the growth atmosphere was air .",
    "the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) of the samples was measured using a standard diffractometer with fe k@xmath19 radiation as an x - ray source in the @xmath20-@xmath21 scan mode .",
    "the resistivity was measured by a four - probe method , below room temperature ( 4.2 - 300 k ) in a liquid he cryostat , and above room temperature ( 300 - 1000 k ) in an electric furnace .",
    "the thermopower was measured using a steady - state technique , below room temperature ( 4.2 - 300 k ) in a liquid he cryostat , and above room temperature ( 300 - 1080 k ) in an electric furnace .",
    "a temperature gradient of 0.5 k / mm was generated by a small resistive heater pasted on one edge of a sample below 500 k and by cooling one edge of a sample by an air pump above 500 k , and was monitored by a differential thermocouple made of copper - constantan below room temperature , and by that of platinum - rhodium above room temperature .",
    "the thermopower of the voltage leads was carefully subtracted .",

    "figure 1 shows typical x - ray diffraction patterns of ( a ) ca(mn@xmath6cu)mn@xmath7o@xmath10 and ( b ) limn@xmath6o@xmath7 .",
    "the samples were successfully prepared as single phases , and all the peaks are indexed @xcite .",
    "although crystal structures are different among ca(mn@xmath8cu@xmath9)mn@xmath7o@xmath10 ( cacu@xmath12ti@xmath7o@xmath10-type ) , pr@xmath15ca@xmath15mno@xmath12 ( gdfeo@xmath12-type ) and limn@xmath6o@xmath7 ( spinel ) , they share a common feature that the mn ions in the conduction path are either trivalent ( mn@xmath4 ) or tetravalent ( mn@xmath5 ) in the high - spin state , being surrounded by the oxygen octahedron .",
    "the mn@xmath4 ion has one @xmath22 electron in the doubly degenerate @xmath23 level , and the oxygen octahedron is elongated in one direction to release the degeneracy through the jahn - teller effect .",
    "in contrast , the mn@xmath5 ion has no jahn - teller effect , and is stable in the undistorted octahedron .",
    "thus , when a hole hops from mn@xmath5 to mn@xmath4 , it inevitably accompanies the elongation of the oxygen octahedra , forming a small polaron .",
    "figure 2 shows the resistivities of the mn oxides .",
    "an important feature of the small - polaron conductor is that the mobility obeys an activation - type temperature dependence , where the activation energy is the binding energy of the polaron ( the jahn - teller distortion energy or the @xmath23 level splitting in the present case ) .",
    "then the resistivity is described by the activation transport as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the activation energy seen in the resistivity . as is clearly shown in fig .",
    "2 , all the resistivities are well described by the activation process .",
    "some of the resistivities show an abrupt increase below a certain temperature , which is due to the charge - ordering transition .",
    "the transition temperature and the resistivity jump are consistent with those in the literature @xcite . above the transition temperature , mn@xmath4 and mn@xmath5",
    "are randomly distributed , where the polaron energy is determined by the jahn - teller distortion of a single ion . on the contrary , mn@xmath4 and mn@xmath5",
    "are ordered below the transition temperature , where the polaron energy is modified by the collective jahn - teller effect .",

    "we examined a least - square fitting with eq .",
    "( 1 ) , as shown in the dotted lines in fig .",
    "2 . note that we used the data only above the transition temperature for the charge - ordered samples . as is clearly shown ,",
    "the extrapolated values @xmath26 are in the range from 6 to 8 m@xmath1 cm .",
    "note that resistivity of solids can vary in a wide range from 10@xmath27 ( copper metal ) to 10@xmath28 ( silica ) @xmath1 cm . in this sense",
    ", we can safely approximate 7@xmath01 m@xmath1 cm as a constant value .",
    "this result is quite anomalous .",
    "resistivity in the high temperature limit is known as the ioffe - regel limit ( or mott s minimum conductivity ) , where the mean free path is nearly equal to the lattice constant ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the resistivity is equal to @xmath30 where @xmath31 is fermi wave vector in a three - dimensional case @xcite .",
    "thus the high - temperature resistivity is dependent on carrier density and crystal structure through @xmath31 and @xmath29 .",
    "then @xmath26 is calculated to be 2 m@xmath1 cm for @xmath31=@xmath32 ( mn@xmath4:mn@xmath5=1:1 ) and @xmath330.4 nm ( a typical mn - o - mn distance of our samples ) , which is reasonably close to the observed value of 7@xmath01 m@xmath1 cm .",
    "figure 3(a ) shows the thermopowers of all the samples .",
    "all the data merge near @xmath34v / k around 800 - 1000 k. note that the thermopower for limn@xmath6o@xmath7 is taken from ref .",
    "koshibae _ _ e__t al .",
    "@xcite have proposed that thermopower of the transition - metal oxides in the high temperature limit is described by an extended heikes formula written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 the degeneracy of the electron configuration on the @xmath37 ions , and @xmath38 the concentration of the b ion , and @xmath39 is the charge difference between the a and b ions . according to eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we calculate the thermopower for mn@xmath4:mn@xmath5=1:1 ( @xmath38=0.5 ) as @xmath40 the mn@xmath4 and mn@xmath5 ions in the mn oxides are in the high - spin state , where mn@xmath4 has the electron configuration of ( @xmath41)@xmath42(@xmath23)@xmath43 as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "2 . near 800 k",
    ", @xmath25 is larger than @xmath44 , which implies that the jahn - teller distortion is effective for the polaron formation .",
    "thus the @xmath23 level splitting is valid ( no orbital degeneracy ) , and @xmath45 should be equal to 5 owing only to the spin degeneracy of @xmath46=2 ( see fig .",
    "3(b ) ) . since the mn@xmath5 ion [ @xmath47 has no orbital degeneracy , @xmath48 is equal to 4 owing to @xmath46=3/2 .",
    "then the thermopower is evaluated to be @xmath49v / k , which is in good agreement with the observed value of @xmath34v / k .",
    "similar results for ( la@xmath50ca@xmath9)mno@xmath12 were reported by palstra _ _ e__t al . @xcite .        above 1000 k ,",
    "the thermopowers begin to decrease , and seem to approach @xmath51v / k as @xmath52 @xcite . for high - temperature extrapolation , we assumed the expression for a high - temperature thermopower as @xmath53 where @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) is a characteristic energy for @xmath46 , and @xmath56 is the thermopower in the high - temperature limit @xcite .",
    "the physical meaning is simple : the @xmath23-orbital degenaracy recovers above 1000 k , where @xmath57 and @xmath58v / k are expected , as shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) .    in the above argument , we evaluated the high - temperature resistivity and thermopower for mn@xmath4:mn@xmath5=1:1 .",
    "this is the case for ca(mn@xmath6cu)mn@xmath7o@xmath10 , limn@xmath6o@xmath7 , and pr@xmath15ca@xmath15mno@xmath12 , but is not applicable to ca(mn@xmath8cu@xmath9)mn@xmath7o@xmath10 ( @xmath591 ) .",
    "however , the observed @xmath60 and @xmath46 seem to have universal values for @xmath52 regardless of the mn@xmath5 content or the carrier density .",
    "we do not have a clear answer for this yet , but propose a possible scenario that the electric conduction occurs in a highly localized way in the high temperature limit , where the exchange of entropy and charge occurs in the neighboring mn@xmath4 and mn@xmath5 ions .",
    "figure 4 schematically shows a local exchange mn@xmath5 for mn@xmath4 .",
    "suppose conduction occurs in a filamentary path of the mn@xmath5 motion .",
    "then the mn@xmath5 ion induces the thermopower of @xmath61 with @xmath62 m@xmath1 cm , every time it replaces the mn@xmath4 site .",
    "we think this phenomena would occur not only in the mn oxides but also in other small - polaron conductors in general .",
    "we prepared various mn oxides consisting of mn@xmath4 and mn@xmath5 ions in the mno@xmath16 octahedron , and measured their resistivity and thermopower from 4 to 1000 k. most unexpectedly , we have found that they seem to have unique asymptotic values in the high temperature limit .",
    "we have explained this in terms of the local ion exchange between mn@xmath4 and mn@xmath5 .",
