    "lead tungstate crystals ( pbwo@xmath2 ) are discussed in @xcite as promising material for a high sensitivity experiment to search for double beta decay of @xmath10cd with the help of cadmium tungstate crystal scintillators ( cdwo@xmath2 ) .",
    "pbwo@xmath2 crystals can be used as light - guides and high efficiency active shield for low - background cdwo@xmath2 scintillation detectors .",
    "using of radiopure pbwo@xmath2 scintillators could allow to build a @xmath11 experiment to search for @xmath12 decay of @xmath10cd at the level of sensitivity @xmath13 yr , which corresponds to the majorana neutrino mass @xmath14 ev .",
    "as it has been demonstrated ( see , for instance @xcite ) , a pulse - shape discrimination ability of the scintillation detector is important to interpret and to reject background caused by internal contamination of @xmath15th and @xmath16u daughters .",
    "however , pulse - shape discrimination technique can be also useful to suppress background in a detector from internal contamination in surrounding scintillator ( for instance , @xmath9 background in the cdwo@xmath2 detector from u / th contamination in the pbwo@xmath2 surrounding crystals @xcite ) .",
    "pulse - shape discrimination in pbwo@xmath2 scintillators can be useful to suppress background @xmath9 events in cdwo@xmath2 detector from @xmath17tl decays in pbwo@xmath2 by off line tagging @xmath8 events from the preceding @xmath18bi decay .",
    "similarly the @xmath9 events from @xmath19bi @xmath20 decay can be rejected by tagging subsequent @xmath19po @xmath8 events in pbwo@xmath2 scintillators .",
    "the aim of the present study was to check a possibility of pulse - shape discrimination with pbwo@xmath2 crystal scintillators .",
    "in addition , the influence of fluorine doping on light yield of pbwo@xmath2 scintillators reported in @xcite has been checked , and response of crystals with different dopants to @xmath8 particles has been investigated .",
    "pbwo@xmath2 single crystals were grown using czochralski technique in an inert ( argon ) atmosphere .",
    "dopants ( re@xmath21 ions ) were added to the raw material ( pbo@xmath22wo@xmath23 ) in the form of re@xmath24o@xmath23 oxides .",
    "fluorine , molybdenum and sulfur were in the melt as a pbf@xmath24 , moo@xmath23 and pbso@xmath2 , correspondingly .",
    "samples for measurements were cut from crystal boules and polished in the form of plates with a diameter of @xmath25 mm and a thickness of @xmath26 mm .",
    "the pbwo@xmath2 crystals used in the present research are listed in the table 1 .",
    "all the crystals were colorless and transparent except one ( 6/03 ) , which was slightly yellow colored .",
    "some of the samples have visible core - like defects .",
    "concentration of mo , eu , gd dopant elements was checked by mass - spectrometry with the help of a secondary ion mass spectrometer ( cameca , ims-4f ) .",

    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]      the samples of pbwo@xmath2 scintillators were wrapped by ptfe reflector tape and optically connected to the pmt emi9256 kb by dow corning q2 - 3067 optical couplant .",
    "the detector was placed into temperature controlled chamber , where the temperature of the detector was stabilized and measured with an accuracy of @xmath27  c. the shaping time of the ortec ( model 572 ) amplifier was set to 0.5 @xmath28s .",

    "an energy resolution fwhm  =  23% was obtained for 662 kev @xmath31 line of @xmath30cs .    the spectrum measured with @xmath33am @xmath8 source is shown in fig .",
    "it should be stressed that even the 60 kev @xmath9 peak of @xmath33am is still resolved from the pmt noise .",

    "the samples of pbwo@xmath2 scintillators were prepared from crystal boules of different diameter ( @xmath25 mm ) and have values of height - to - diameter ratio ( h / d ) in the range @xmath35 .",
    "relative light output of scintillators with the high index of refraction ( the index of refraction of pbwo@xmath2 crystals is 2.2 ) depends on the h / d ratio . to take into account such an effect ,",
    "we have carried out measurements with cdwo@xmath2 crystal scintillators ( index of refraction in the range @xmath36 ) with the h / d ratio in the range @xmath37 . a cdwo@xmath2 crystal with the initial value of h / d  =  0.9 was used for the measurements . to obtain the samples with lower h / d ratio ,",

    "the data were fitted by the polynomial function @xmath39 .",
    "then the values of relative light output measured with pbwo@xmath2 scintillators were corrected by using the experimentally determined coefficients . the relative light output measured with the pbwo@xmath2 samples after correction on the height - to - diameter ratio ( corrections do not exceed 10% )",
    "are presented in table  2 .",
    "we do not observe an increasing of light output of pbwo@xmath2 scintillators grown by czochralski method and doped by fluorine , as reported in @xcite .",
    "this result is in agreement with @xcite . recently",

    "as it was checked by surface - barrier silicon detector , the energy of @xmath8 particles was reduced to about 5.25 mev going through 2  mm of air in the collimator .",
    "the energy scale was calibrated with the help of the 570 and 1064 kev @xmath9 lines of a @xmath38bi source .",

    "the @xmath0 ratio measured with the external @xmath8 source are in the range of @xmath41 which is an agreement with result reported in @xcite .",
    "the errors of the @xmath0 ratio are mainly due to uncertainties in the energy calibration of the pbwo@xmath2 detectors due to the poor energy resolution of the @xmath9 peaks .",

    "the energy spectrum of pbwo@xmath2 scintillator ( sample 10/03 ) measured during 2600 s is presented in fig .",
    "a clear peak in the spectrum can be attributed to @xmath8 decay of @xmath40po ( the energy of @xmath8 particles is 5.31 mev ) from internal contamination of the crystal by @xmath40pb .",
    "the @xmath0 ratio is @xmath42 , the activity of @xmath40po in the crystal is @xmath43 bq / kg .",
    "as one can see in table 2 , the values obtained with external @xmath8 source and by using the peak of internal @xmath40po are in agreement .",
    "some difference in the values of the @xmath0 ratio between the studied pbwo@xmath2 samples was observed .",
    "however , we can not interpret the difference as own properties of the samples .",
    "it is because the @xmath0 ratio is not only a property of a crystal , but also a certain characteristics of the scintillation detector depending on the shape , sizes , surface treatment , transparency of a crystal , etc . to check a possible effect of dopant elements on the @xmath0 ratio in pbwo@xmath2 scintillators",

    "the shapes of scintillation pulses in the sample 13/03 , and in the samples doped by molybdenum were also measured in a time interval @xmath44s with the help of the 20 msample / s 12 bit digitizer @xcite . to determine shapes of scintillation pulses for the sample 13/03 , and for the samples with molybdenum , the data obtained with both the 20 and 125 msample / s digitizers were used .",
    "the pulse shapes were constructed in the time interval @xmath45 @xmath28s from the 125 msample / s data , and in the interval @xmath46 @xmath28s from the data measured by the 20 msample / s device .",
    "the pulse shapes for @xmath9 quanta and @xmath8 particles measured with the pbwo@xmath2 crystal ( 7/03 ) doped by f and eu , and ( 14/03 ) doped by f , eu , mo are depicted in fig .",
