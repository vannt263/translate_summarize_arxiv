    "even more mysterious is its connection to the phenomenon of _ downsizing _ , the anti - hierarchical growth of galaxies and black holes . while dark matter grows and assembles in a strictly hierarchical fashion , with the most massive dark matter haloes continuing to grow over cosmic time by accretion of smaller haloes , the formation and growth of galaxies inside those halos proceeds differently ( e.g. , *",

    "this picture has been verified both by `` archeological studies '' of local galaxies , and by probing ongoing star formation at increasing redshifts @xcite , and has alternatively been called ` downsizing ' or ` anti - hierarchical ' growth .",

    "however , the precise nature of this connection is not understood , and it is not clear if all or only some agn phases affect their host galaxies .    in this paper , we explore properties of the host galaxies of agn and the nature of their black hole growth in the local universe ( @xmath10 ) and discuss what these properties imply for the role of agn in the evolution of the host galaxies . in our investigation , we go beyond characterizing agn host galaxies as a single class , as in some previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we now discuss in detail how we measure emission lines , use them on emission line diagrams , and assess the completeness of this selection .",

    "is not possible via emission line selection due to contamination from star formation ( see section [ sec : complete ] for details ) .",
    "we measure the emission line fluxes using an analysis tool called gas and absorption line fitting algorithm ( gandalf ; @xcite ) , which uses the penalized pixel - fitting method ppxf method of @xcite to simultaneously fit the stellar continuum and nebular emission lines .",
    "the advantage of this tool is that it is designed to minimize template mismatch , where emission and absorption lines are difficult to separate ( see @xcite and @xcite for example applications ) .",
    "we use a set of stellar templates from @xcite plus gaussian emission line templates .",
    "we measure  fluxes for each processed sdss spectrum and compute the total luminosity  by correcting for extinction based on the measured balmer decrement .",
    "gandalf also provides measurements of the stellar velocity dispersion . since the fixed sdss spectroscopic fibre samples the light out to a different fraction of the effective radius , we use the empirical correction derived by @xcite to correct the velocity dispersion to the effective radius of the bulge surface - brightness profile .",
    "our agn selection technique is the same as used by @xcite : we first separate galaxies whose narrow emission lines are dominated partially or wholly by star formation on the  diagram ( figure [ fig : bpt ] , _ left _ ) by using the extreme starburst line of @xcite to retain only those beyond this line ( i.e. , the top - right of the diagram ) . between this extreme starburst line and the empirical pure starburst line of @xcite",
    ", there is a substantial population of composite objects where both agn and star formation are comparable in ionizing luminosity .",
    "we exclude this class for this study and note that by removing this class of potential agn , we may be removing an important phase in the agn - galaxy co - evolution at low redshift .",
    "the main problem with the composite class is the lack of easily accessible spectral indicators that would allow a clean separation of agn and star formation .",
    "we are thus left with galaxies whose emission lines are dominated by sources of ionization other than young stars .",
    "these sources may be agn , but can also include slow - moving shocks and gas excited by post - agb stars and horizontal branch stars .",
    "these non - stellar sources are empirically divided into two branches , a division that is most obvious in the  diagram ( figure [ fig : bpt ] , _ right _ ) .",
    "the lower branch of this population was first designated as ` low - ionization narrow emission - line regions ' , or liners , by .",
    "the upper branch is identified with galaxies hosting type 2 ( seyfert ) agn .",
    "originally thought to be low - luminosity agn , the nature of the liner ionisation mechanism has since been debated , and it is becoming increasingly clear that the majority of galaxies with liner spectra are unlikely to be low - luminosity agn . the physical footprint of the line emitting area in nearby liners has been determined to be extended on kpc scales ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and thus is unlikely be photoionized by a nuclear source .",
    "a detailed analysis of the distribution of this extended liner emission in nearby sauron galaxies by @xcite demonstrates that the majority of liners are incompatible with an ionization source in the nucleus , even in the case of galaxies known to host ( x - ray or radio - detected ) agn , but instead are powered by some component of the underlying old stellar population .",
    "@xcite further show that this extended liner emission is sufficiently strong to be detected in sdss spectra of more distant @xmath25 galaxies .",
    "@xcite have recently similarly argued that many of the sdss objects in the liner box are `` retired '' galaxies powered by old stellar populations .",
    "while it is certainly the case that some x - ray detected agn exhibit _ nuclear _ liner spectra , the presence of liner - like line ratios _ over the large physical footprint of the sdss spectroscopic fiber _ does not imply the presence of a low - luminosity agn .",
    "liners are thus potentially highly diverse and the majority of them are not low - luminosity agn .",
    "even if a low - luminosity agn were present , the emission sampled by the spectroscopic fiber can not disentangle the relative contributions .",
    "we therefore decided to eliminate them from our sample and to retain only the definite agn for our analysis .",
    "since galaxies exhibiting liner spectra are different from those hosting seyfert agn , we verify that the inclusion of the small number of liners that are above the luminosity limit of  @xmath26established in the next section does not significantly change our results , as most liners have substantially lower  luminosities and eddington ratios compared to seyfert agn and are thus not sites of substantial black hole growth ( see appendix [ sec : liners ] for details ) .",
    "the  diagram allows for the best separation of agn and liners , so we use it for those spectra where  is detected with s / n @xmath27 3 . in cases",

    "we thereby select a sample of 942 narrow line agn ( table [ tab : sy_prop ] ) .",

    "the agn must always excite a narrow - line region , and 2 .",
    "the emission lines from the narrow - line region must never be overwhelmed by lines excited by other processes , in particular star formation .",
    "many recent studies of agn host galaxies have noted that agn tend to concentrate in the green valley on the color - mass diagram , i.e. , at intermediate optical colors , and that there are very few agn in the blue cloud and the red sequence .",

    "the lack of relatively luminous agn ( @xmath29 ) in the blue cloud has been recently been established by @xcite using hard x - ray - selected agn , demonstrating that , at these luminosities , the absence of agn is not a selection effect .    but could there still be a population of low - luminosity emission line agn in the blue cloud whose emission lines are overwhelmed by star formation ?",
    "for substantially lower luminosity agn than those studied by by @xcite , any x - ray detection in blue cloud star - forming galaxies is likely ambiguous in the 0.210 kev window accessed by  and as this could be due to star formation and x - ray binaries .",
    "can we do any better with emission line diagnostics ?    in order to test whether emission line agn similar to those we select on bpt diagrams might be hidden in blue cloud star - forming galaxies , we perform a simple empirical experiment .",

    "we rescale the agn emission line fluxes to a specific  to simulate the effect of adding a agn of a certain luminosity .",

    ", we plot the 1,000 composite objects scaled to the three specific  values .",
    "this addition of an agn component moves the position of a star - forming object off the star - forming locus , into the composite region and finally onto the agn region . for added sefyerts with  @xmath35 , we find that only 1.4% remain below the @xcite empirical starburst line . however , for  @xmath36and @xmath32 , this fraction increases to 12.8% and 56.6% respectively .",
    "similarly , the fractions of agn that move below the @xcite extreme starburst line into the composite region are 85.5% , 54.4% and 12.9% respectively .    from this experiment , we conclude that towards the higher luminosities in our sample ( @xmath37 ) , our sample is complete even in the blue cloud , and that there is no substantial population of such blue - cloud agn . for lower luminosities ,  @xmath38 ,",
    "this is no longer true , and there may potentially be agn in the blue cloud whose narrow - line region is overwhelmed by current star formation . if there is such a population of agn , they can not be detected via emission line diagnostics , just as selection in the x - rays would be challenging .",
    "however , a recent search for for broad - line agn hidden in star - forming galaxies by @xcite found only three such objects in a parent sample of over 3,200 objects , establishing a lower limit on the very low - luminosity agn fraction in the blue cloud of @xmath39 , which suggests that the true abundance of such objects is very low , though broad lines may be similarly diluted by host galaxy light .",
    "we diagnose the accretion state of the black hole using the  line . observed correlations between  and other indicators of agn luminosity",
    "imply that  is a reasonably good indicator of the current accretion rate , though with considerable scatter @xcite .",
    "more recent work by @xcite comparing a variety of indicators of the intrinsic bolometric output of local agn do show that  may not be an isotropic indicator and that type 2 agn  such as those in our sample  are intrinsically more obscured , and therefore more luminous , than previously thought , even based on hard x - ray observations ( @xcite ; cf .",

    "while the resolution of the sdss spectra and the templates used is approximately 60 , we are able to use gandalf to probe slightly below this resolution limit .",

    "previous studies have only used this absolute distribution to interpret the role of agn in galaxy evolution ",
    "and then only for the whole galaxy population , not for the two main morphology classes separately .",
    "the agn _ fraction _ on the color - mass diagram ( figure [ fig : sy_frac ] ) is more enlightening than the absolute distribution because in any area on the color - mass diagram , _ the agn fraction is a proxy for the duty cycle of agn and therefore for the importance of agn for the evolution of galaxies of specific masses , colors and morphologies_. the duty cycle is the fraction of the time that a galaxy spends as a agn in a specific population .",
    "the agn fraction is a proxy of this because galaxies do not move rapidly on this diagram relative to the life time of agn phases .",
    "typical agn lifetimes are estimated to be on the order of @xmath47 years , approaching @xmath48 years only for the most massive black holes which , in any case , are not active in the local universe @xcite .",
    "the movement of galaxies on the color - mass diagram on the other hand is slow : mass - doubling timescales due to star formation are on the order of @xmath49 years @xcite while major mergers are rare in the local universe @xcite .",
    "stellar evolution limits the pace of movement in the color direction .",
    "the most rapid color evolution possible is that of the instantaneous shutdown of star formation resulting in a movement from blue to red in @xmath50gyr .",
    "thus , the fraction of agn in any area on the color - mass diagram is probing the fraction of time that agn are switched on in that population , and therefore it is a measure of the duty - cycle .",
    "we present the agn fraction for our sample in figure [ fig : sy_frac ] , which has a very similar layout as figure [ fig : sy_cmass ] .",
    "we do not fill the general galaxy population contours , but do leave the gray dotted contours indicating the whole galaxy population to guide the eye .",
    "we overplot the fraction of agn host galaxies , with increasingly dark shades of green indicating a higher agn fraction .",
    "it is immediately apparent from figures [ fig : sy_cmass ] and [ fig : sy_frac ] that the absolute and relative distribution of agn host galaxies are substantially different , and that this difference is a very strong function of morphology .",
    "figures [ fig : sy_cmass ] and [ fig : sy_frac ] suggest that the early - type and late - type host galaxies of agn are fundamentally different populations , and that analysing the entire agn host galaxy population as a whole obscures these differences .",
    "there is no ` typical ' agn host galaxy .",
    "we note at this point that , out of the entire sample of 942 agn host galaxies , only 12 ( 1.3% ) were classified as ongoing major mergers with serious disturbances by @xcite ; the vast majority of emission - line selected agn in the local universe are _ not _ hosted by galaxies undergoing a major merger .    from their distribution in figure",
    "[ fig : sy_cmass ] , we see that the agn host galaxies span nearly the entire observed range of the general galaxy population ( in this sample ) in stellar mass .",
    "this is not the case for color ; many works have already noted that agn host galaxies preferentially reside in the green valley at intermediate host galaxy colors and that they are less common in the blue cloud and the red sequence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , when we consider the agn fraction in figure [ fig : sy_frac ] , this population is put into context  compared to the total number of galaxies on the red sequence , the agn population is lower by at least a factor of 1020 than in the peak regions , and",
    "therefore so is the duty cycle of these agn .",
    "hence , the importance of agn to galaxy evolution on the red sequence is likely very small : we note that the population of agn host galaxies at the massive end of the red sequence is almost entirely of indeterminate- and late - type morphology ; massive early - type hosts are rare .",
    "the agn fraction is strongly concentrated below the red sequence and at relatively high host stellar masses of @xmath51 .",

    "host galaxies from the blue cloud is more complex : as discussed in section [ sec : complete ] , their absence is not significant for agn at the lower end of the  of agn in our sample ( see figure [ fig : sy_lo3 ] ) , because the signature of the agn narrow - line region could be overwhelmed by star formation . at higher luminosities of @xmath52 , the absence of blue cloud agn",

    "what happens when we split the agn population by morphology ? in the remaining panels of figure [ fig : sy_cmass ] and [ fig : sy_frac ] , a dramatically different picture emerges wherein the early- and late - type agn host galaxies are shown to be significantly different populations .",
    "the absolute distribution of agn host galaxies in figure [ fig : sy_cmass ] already shows that the typical host stellar mass early - type agn hosts is lower than that of late - type agn hosts .    turning to the agn fraction and therefore to where the agn duty cycle is highest",
    ", this picture becomes even more extreme .",
    "the agn fraction peaks at a stellar mass of @xmath51  in the general population , and ranges from @xmath54 .",
    "once we split by morphology in figure [ fig : sy_frac ] , the difference between early- and late - type hosts becomes even more striking than for the absolute distribution : while for the late - types the agn fraction still peaks strongly at @xmath55 , the agn fraction in the early - type population peaks at @xmath56 , an order of magnitude lower than in both the late - types and and the general population",
    ". this division has not been apparent in previous works due to a lack reliable morphological classification for very large numbers of galaxies .",
    "because the early - type agn make up only @xmath57 of all agn ( see table [ tab : sy_prop ] ) , their properties are overwhelmed by the late - types in a general agn host galaxies sample .",
    "the most striking aspect of the agn fraction in figure [ fig : sy_frac ] is that in the early - type population , the agn duty cycle is highest in an extreme population of early - types that do not reside on the red sequence , but rather below it at the low - mass end and above the bulk of the blue cloud , i.e. , in the green valley .",
    "similarly , the agn duty cycle for late - type galaxies is highest in objects that are more massive and redder than the typical late - type population .",
    "these red late - types will include a substantial fraction of inclined spirals with intrinsically blue colours , but dimmed and reddened by dust . if the detected agn fraction is independent of host galaxy inclination , which is expected if the bulk of the nuclear obscuration comes from the central regions orientated randomly with respect to the galaxy , then these contaminants to the red part of the late - type colour - mass diagram from the part with much lower agn fractions will make this conclusion even stronger .",
    "the indeterminate - type galaxies exhibit an agn fraction distribution similar to the late - types , though their agn fraction does not extend into the higher mass red sequence .",
    "this may be explained by the fact that the incidence of indeterminate - type galaxies in the red sequence is much higher than that of late - types .",
    "we therefore tentatively conclude that the indeterminate - type agn , which are 45% of the agn population after all , appear to behave more similar to the late - types than the early - types .",
    "when we make a cut in eddington parameter of @xmath58 , corresponding to an eddington ratio of  @xmath59 , an even more extreme picture occurs . by making a cut in eddington ratio",
    ", we avoid any bias towards more massive black holes which radiate at higher luminosities at fixed  than their low - mass counterparts .",
    "figure [ fig : sy_frac2 ] is identical to figure [ fig : sy_frac ] except for the cut in .",
    "this reveals that the duty cycle of high eddington agn is significant in only one population of low - redshift galaxies : low - mass early - type galaxies in the green valley .",
    "we conclude that the early- and late - type host galaxies of agn are fundamentally different populations : _ for late - type hosts , agn preferentially reside in ) galaxies either with green colors or on the red sequence .",
    "in contrast , early - type agn tend to have and strongly cluster in the green valley in between the blue cloud and the red sequence .",
    "we further showed that the duty cycle for high eddington agn is high only in green valley early - type galaxies .",
    "_    the agn fraction on the color - mass diagram is a new and powerful tool to probe the duty cycle of agn . under the assumption that a high duty cycle agn phase is more likely to affect the host galaxy evolution",
    ", the duty cycle is in turn a measure of the importance of agn for galaxy formation for specific galaxy populations .",
    "we have shown that the properties of early- and late - type agn host galaxies are different .",
    "this in turn strongly suggests that the triggering and fuelling of the agn , as well as their role in the host evolution , are different .",
    "we therefore continue our discussion with the black hole masses and accretion efficiencies of black holes in early- and late - type agn host galaxies .",
    "note that the characteristic black hole mass of the agn is  @xmath60  and that this value is approximately independent of the host galaxy morphology ( table [ tab : sy_prop ] ) .",
    "the active black holes in late - types hosts are typically more massive than those in early - types by only @xmath610.2 dex , or less than a factor of 2",
    ". combined with the fact that the typical accretion rate estimated by  is the same in early- and late - types , we find that the eddington ratios as inferred via the eddington parameter  are similar , with the agn in early - types having eddington ratios that are only about a factor 1.5 lower than those in late - types .",
    "thus , the typical black hole mass growing today in early- and late - type galaxies is the same , with the same range of eddington ratios .",
    "in addition , the host galaxy colors of the agn host galaxies place them preferentially in the green valley , adding to an apparent picture where the conditions for black hole growth are approximately independent of host morphology .",
    "however , as we have shown in the previous section , the stellar masses of early- and late - type host galaxies are very different , so taking only population averages into consideration can obscure crucial variations between populations .",
    "similarly , it is not just relevant which black holes are currently accreting , but also to what degree these growing black holes are different from those in their quiescent parent population , and crucially , how this difference depends on host morphology .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sy_mbh ] , we plot the distribution of inferred supermassive black hole masses for both the agn ( _ striped _ ) and the normal galaxy population ( _ soild _ ) , both for the entire sample , and split by host morphology .",
    "these histograms highlight that taking the mean , and ignoring the distribution of black hole masses in the parent population masks intrinsically very different distributions of black hole growth . even though the median black hole masses of active early- and late - type galaxies are comparable ( table [ tab : sy_prop ] ) , a kolmogorov - smirnov test shows that they are drawn from different parent distributions at the 99.7% significance level .    the distribution of active black holes in late - type hosts skewed towards higher black hole mass , peaks at  @xmath62  and cuts off above  @xmath63 .",
    "this contrasts sharply with the distribution of black hole masses in all late - types galaxies , which decreases with increasing black hole mass . plotting the _ fraction _ of active supermassive black holes in late - type galaxies in figure [ fig : sy_fmbh ] , we find a strongly increasing fraction from @xmath64 at @xmath65to @xmath66 at @xmath67 . at greater black hole masses ,",
    "the fraction may begin to decline again , until we run out of number statistics .",
    "the black holes of early - type galaxies show a radically different picture ( figure [ fig : sy_mbh ] ) .",
    "the mass distribution of active black holes in early - type galaxies is skewed towards the lowest inferred masses in our sample .",
    "plotting the active fraction as for the late - types in figure [ fig : sy_fmbh ] , we find a very different behaviour .",
    "the fraction of active black holes in early - type galaxies is _ decreasing _ with increasing black hole mass , but we run out of galaxies to provide adequate number statistics .",
    "these two very different trends in early- and late - type hosts are unlikely to be selection effects .",
    "since we are able to detect agn in low - mass early - types down to host galaxies with stellar masses of @xmath68 ; we do not see agn in late - type hosts where the lowest - mass hosts are @xmath69 . in order to substantially change the trend of increasing agn fraction with increasing black hole mass",
    ", we would have to have missed a very large number of agn in low mass blue cloud late - type galaxies , more than ten times the number in our sample . to change the distribution to one skewed to low masses similar to the distribution of the early - types , an increase by a factor of @xmath611000 would be required ( figure [ fig : sy_frac ] ) . at luminosities above the @xmath70",
    "completeness limit in section [ sec : complete ] , we are not missing any agn in star - forming galaxies that might change this trend . since the majority of the agn contributing to the trends in figure [ fig : sy_fmbh ] are above this limit ( see figure [ fig : sy_lo3 ] )",
    ", only lower - luminosity agn might change these trends ( see also [ sec : liners ] ) . currently , there are no indications that such a large population of low - luminosity agn exists ( factor of @xmath611000 greater in number than observed ) , but our results are an additional motivation to search for them .    we restrict our agn sample by eddington ratio as we did in section [ sec : hostgals ] by limiting the agn sample to those agn with @xmath58 ( which corresponds to  @xmath71 ) in order to test whether the trend we see in figure [ fig : sy_fmbh ] is due to a bias against low - mass black holes at a fixed eddington ratio .",
    "such a bias is unlikely to be the cause of the different trends we see for early- and late - type hosts as it would imply vastly different distributions of eddington ratios . imposing this cut in eddingto ratio to figure [ fig : sy_fmbh ] yields qualitatively the same trend , though the increase in the agn fraction for the late - type hosts is less steep .",
    "_ in summary , dividing the local agn host galaxy population by morphology reveals that that there are two very different modes of black hole growth : in early - types , it is preferentially the black holes that are actively accreting material in an agn phase . in late - type galaxies , it is preferentially the black holes that are active , with a potential decline at the very highest masses .",
    "_ since the early - type agn are only 11% of the population , this effect can easily be masked by studies of the agn population as a whole .",
    "despite the differences discussed in the previous section , the velocity dispersion  and therefore the bulge mass and black hole mass  of agn host galaxies is independent of morphology ( table [ tab : sy_prop ] and figure [ fig : sy_lo3 ] ) .",
    "another common feature is the green host galaxy colors .",
    "this raises the possibility that these conditions are most favorable to fuelling a black hole , at least in low - redshift galaxies .",
    "the late - type agn hosts are an order of magnitude more massive @xmath72  simply because of the presence of a massive disks .",
    "the bulges of late - types that host agn appear to be very similar to the low - mass , @xmath73 , early - type galaxies that host agn .",
    "however , as we have shown , the early- and late - type host galaxies of agn are fundamentally different populations both in terms of _ which galaxies _ host agn , and also _ which black holes _ are growing . only by comparing the agn hosts to normal galaxies not just of the same mass and color , but also morphology ,",
    "does it become clear that the two populations differ from each other in fundamental ways .",
    "what are the consequences of our findings for the role of agn in galaxy evolution in the local universe ? in this section , we outline a new view of the impact of agn on galaxy evolution and make the case that agn perform very different roles in early- and late - type host galaxies .          as discussed in section [ sec : results ] , while there are a number of agn in early - type galaxies on the red sequence , the fraction of early - type galaxies on the red sequence that host agn is very small , _",
    "i.e. _ , the duty cycle of agn in this population is small as well when compared to the peak duty cycle in the green valley .",
    "we see from figure [ fig : sy_frac ] that the duty cycle of agn in early - type host galaxies is peaked in a well - defined band at intermediate green colors precisely in the green valley above the blue cloud and below the low mass end of the red sequence .",
    "if the early - type agn hosts in the green valley are post - starburst objects , then there clearly is an ample supply of star - forming progenitor galaxies at the same mass in the blue cloud.these progenitors would evolve to the green valley if star formation is suppressed , and will continue to fade onto the low - mass end of the red sequence .",
    "such progenitors may already have early - type morphology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or they may first transform their morphology in a major merger , as simulations seem to show ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such a major merger may also fuel the black hole , giving rise to the agn phase observed at a later stage @xcite .",
    "simulations by @xcite show that minor mergers with a gas - rich dwarf are not sufficient to move a red early - type progenitor to the optical blue cloud ( though they may reach uv - blue colors ) and so are not a good candidate for the trigger mechanism .",
    "of course , it does not follow from the intermediate optical colors of green valley galaxies that they must be in transition from blue to red .",
    "there are multiple , very different star formation histories that can result in green colors",
    ". a slightly enhanced dust screen covering an actively star forming galaxy would suffice .",
    "more complex scenarios are also imaginable .",
    "that early - type agn hosts galaxies genuinely are a transition population was shown by @xcite ; however , this does _ not _ imply that the agn phase in the green valley is necessarily the _ cause _ for the shutdown of star formation and the transition from blue to red .",
    "rather , the absence of active black hole accretion in blue cloud objects , established by @xcite , implies that there must be a significant time delay on the order of at least 100 myr , more likely more like 500 myr , between whichever process suppresses star formation and the onset of substantial agn radiation .",
    "furthermore , @xcite showed that the extremely rapid destruction of the molecular gas reservoir that fuels star formation coincides with a very low - level of accretion preceding the agn phase in so - called composite objects and that this very low - luminosity phase  perhaps accompanied by a radiatively inefficient kinetic outflow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )  may be responsible for the shutdown of star formation by removing the molecular gas reservoir .",
    "regardless of whether any agn phase is responsible for the shutdown of star formation , the duty cycle of agn in the present day early - type galaxy population is highest in low - mass green valley objects in which star formation has already been shut down and which are in the process of moving to the red sequence .",
    "the duty cycle of agn in massive , red sequence early - types on the other hand is very low .",
    "the majority of black hole growth in early - type galaxies at low redshift thus appears to be a post - starburst phenomenon , rather than part of a coeval starburst .",
    "figure [ fig : sy_frac2 ] furthermore illustrates that it is _ only _ this population of low redshift galaxies that has a substantial duty cycle of high eddington accretion .",
    "the late - type agn host galaxies are genuine late - type spirals , not s0/sa galaxies that consist of a large bulge and a small disk , even at the highest masses , where the duty cycle is highest .",
    "we show example images of massive late - type agn hosts in figure [ fig : massive_late_type_agn ] . while the host galaxies are quite massive , their bulges are not  this is apparent from their bulge velocity dispersions , and therefore their modest black hole masses , which are comparable to those of active early - type galaxies ; they therefore must have substantial disks which make up the remaining stellar mass ( figure [ fig : sy_mbh ] and table [ tab : sy_prop ] ) . to put it another way ,",
    "the typical black hole masses , bulge masses and eddington ratios of early- and late - type agn hosts are similar , but the late - type hosts are substantially more massive due to the presence of a massive disk .    at the same time , the distribution of eddington parameters ( figure [ fig : sy_lo3 ] and table [ tab : sy_prop ] ) does not provide a comprehensive picture : comparing figure [ fig : sy_frac ] shows that the duty cycle of agn  as we are able to detect them via emission line diagnostics  is high in high - mass , green late - types .",
    "however , figure [ fig : sy_frac2 ] shows that the duty cycle of high eddington - rate accretion is low in those late - types , especially when compared to the green valley early - types .",
    "given the distinct location of late - type agn host galaxies on the color - mass diagram , what role do the agn play in the evolution of late - type galaxies ?",
    "we argued previously that the early - type agn represent the true green valley transition population .",
    "the majority of agn hosted by late - type galaxies do _ not _ reside between the blue cloud and the low - mass end of the green valley and therefore can not be part of the same blue - green - red transition .",
    "a minority of the late - type agn hosts do however have sufficiently low masses to plausibly originate from the blue cloud .",
    "the absence of a substantial duty cycle for high eddington accretion in these objects further supports this , as the agn of the early - type hosts do have such a high duty cycle .",
    "there is also an absence of agn at the very highest masses @xmath74  which may indicate a feedback process that has shut down accretion in those objects , or this may be due to insufficient number statistics .",
    "we consider a number of scenarios that may account for the presence of agn in late - types ; any such scenario must account for three observational characteristics : ( i ) characteristic host mass of @xmath72 , ( ii ) late - type host galaxy morphology , and ( iii ) intermediate / green host galaxy color .",
    "the first possible scenario for the origin of the late - type agn hosts is the major merger of two disk galaxies that results in the fuelling of the black hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we know from the visual inspection of merging galaxies in the sdss universe that disk - disk mergers at @xmath72  do occur @xcite",
    ". however , there is a lack of _ blue _ progenitor galaxies at @xmath72  that might evolve toward the red sequence as star formation is suppressed ( see figure [ fig : sy_frac ] ) .",
    "both factors thus make it unlikely that late - type agn hosts are the product of such a merger and so we conclude that this scenario does not account for criterion ( i ) .",
    "also , a major merger would likely have destroyed the disk that is clearly visible in the sdss images ( figure [ fig : massive_late_type_agn ] ) .",
    "simulations show that mergers involving particularly gas - rich progenitors can result in a disk - dominated remnant @xcite , but only for particular orientation of the angular momentum vectors .",
    "major mergers are already rare , and this requirement further reduces that probability by a large factor . moreover ,",
    "such extremely gas - rich , massive progenitor galaxies do not exist in the low - redshift universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and so major mergers are an unlikely channel for the triggering of agn in low redshift late - type galaxies .",
    "one possible scenario for the origin of late - type agn is a mixed merger between a disk- and a massive spheroid - dominated system , which is predicted to be very common by some models of galaxy formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mixed merger scenario alleviates one of the problems with major mergers , as there is an ample supply of massive early - type , red progenitors available on the red sequence .",
    "it also accounts to some extent for the green host galaxy colors ( iii ) ; while the red sequence progenitor does not have a ready supply of cold gas available for star formation , the late - type progenitor does .",
    "however , this scenario also faces some problems : why does the mixed merger result in green , rather than blue optical colors ?",
    "one explanation might be that the late - type progenitor originates from the blue cloud proper and is substantially less massive ( @xmath73 ) , bringing in only a small amount of cold gas that can fuel only a minor starburst .",
    "simulations of minor mergers between passive early - type galaxies and an ensemble of small gas - rich galaxies by @xcite show that such events can produce the intermediate @xmath45 colors exhibited by the late - type agn hosts .",
    "while a major mixed merger likely also destroys the disk in the late - type progenitor , a minor merger might not , thus satisfying criterion ( ii ) .",
    "however , another problem is that the bulges of the late - type agn hosts are comparable in velocity dispersion to the significantly less massive early - type agn hosts and therefore are predominantly disk - dominated systems ; a mixed merger of this type seems unlikely to build a massive disk ( similar to that of the milky way ; see section [ sec : mw ] ) around a small bulge .",
    "thus a contradiction arises : in order to account for the green colors , the early - type must be more massive than the late - type , but in order to ensure the survival of the disk , the late - type must be more massive than the early - type .",
    "another possibility is that the agn is regulating the strength of the starburst and preventing it from moving the host galaxy all the way to blue cloud colors , which is commensurate with the idea that agn are more common in late - type galaxies with high black hole masses .",
    "all the scenarios outlined here are problematic and none of them account for all the observed properties of late - type agn host galaxies .",
    "perhaps an agn phase in late - type galaxies does not significantly affect the evolution of the host galaxy , and all we see is secular evolution .",
    "a slight increase in the amount of gas in the bulge increases the odds for stochastic accretion of gas , perhaps driven by a bar @xcite or more generally by disk - driven evolution .",
    "other possibilities include mass loss from evolved stars , the infall of a minor dwarf galaxy or the tidal disruption of a star by the black hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )    as we have discussed , it is unlikely that the late - type agn hosts are involved in the same transition from the blue cloud to the red sequence that the early - types appear to be involved in .",
    "the role of agn in the evolution of late - type galaxies must therefore be a different one from the early - types .",
    "a major difference between the early- and late - type agn hosts that highlights the different nature of black hole accretion is that the late - types do not have any sub - population that has a high duty cycle of high eddington accretion ( figure [ fig : sy_frac2 ] ) .",
    "since there are no major ongoing starbursts in late - type agn hosts and the duty cycle for high eddington accretion is low , perhaps all back hole growth has already taken place at high redshift and all we are seeing is a minor re - activation due to one of the processes mentioned above .    given that none of the scenario we outlined are satisfactory explanations , the co - evolution of late - type galaxies and their black holes  unlike in the case of early - types  remains an outstanding issue .",
    "the only part of the early - type galaxy population that is experiencing a high duty cycle of black hole growth at high efficiencies are low - mass post - starburst early - type galaxies transitioning from the blue cloud to the low - mass end of the red sequence .",
    "this population is continuing the build - up of the red sequence , so it is natural to speculate that the process is a downsized version of the process that led to the formation and quenching of more massive early - type galaxies at high redshift which are known to be older and to have formed on shorter time scales .",
    "the late - type agn are not associated with the same transition from blue cloud to the red sequence and their role in the evolution of their hosts is less clear . the majority of the black hole growth in the local universe is associated with late - type hosts ( at least @xmath75 , and almost 90% , if we include all indeterminate - types ) , and only @xmath6111% is associated with early - types .",
    "thus , the mode of black hole growth at work in late - type galaxies is significantly more common in the local universe than the one at work in early - types , and so most black hole growth is not associated with the blue  red transition seen in early - types .",
    "recent observations of x - ray - selected agn host galaxies in deep fields by @xcite suggest that the fraction of agn host galaxies with late - type morphology is only @xmath76 at @xmath77 , indicating a decrease of the late - type fraction with increasing redshift , though the agn population studied by @xcite is somewhat more luminous that in our sample .",
    "this decrease may suggest that the appearance of the mode of black hole growth at work in late - type galaxies is relatively recent , perhaps becoming apparent only around @xmath77 when the assembly of the hubble sequence begins to finalize .",
    "another possibility is that this mode has always been active at a moderate level , but that the agn host galaxy population at high redshift is dominated by the downsizing mode at work in the early - type population .",
    "the two modes at work in early- and late - type galaxies , respectively , change in importance with cosmic time , the late - type mode may account for the the observed peak at @xmath78 in the number density of moderate - luminosity x - ray selected agn at @xmath79 , while the mode at work in late - types is responsible for the high redshift peak of luminous agn . as star formation and black hole growth moves to less massive early - type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the black hole growth mode in early - type galaxies also becomes less luminous and thus by @xmath80 becomes overwhelmed by the late - type mode .",
    "perhaps the local universe does not tell us much about the agn - host galaxy connection because black hole growth rates and and star formation rates have declined so substantially since @xmath81 except in a few rare systems more reminiscent of activity at high redshift ( e.g. ngc 6240 ) ?",

    "estimates of the stellar mass of the milky way vary , but are around @xmath72 , while the current star formation rate is approximately 3  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these parameters place the milky way right where the agn fraction for late - type galaxies is highest , between 5 and 10% and therefore the duty cycle is the highest .",
    "however , this also implies that the black holes in galaxies like the milky way are _ not _ active @xmath84 of the time at the luminosity of the typical seyfert in the sdss universe ( @xmath70 , see section [ sec : complete ] and [ sec : sy_prop ] ) .",
    "the black hole at the center of the milky way at sagittarius a@xmath85 ( sgr a@xmath85 ) is , apart from occasional weak flares , remarkably quiet with an extremely sub - eddington accretion rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , there is evidence that sgr a@xmath85 was substantially more active in the very recent past .",
    "hard x - ray observations with _",
    "asca _ showed fe k@xmath86 lines around galactic center emitted by the molecular cloud complex surrounding the black hole .",
    "follow - up observations with more recent hard x - ray facilities indicate that sgr a@xmath85 was orders of magnitude , perhaps @xmath87 times more luminous in the last few hundred years than it is currently .",
    "_ suzaku _ observations by @xcite detect a k@xmath86 luminosity consistent with sgr a@xmath85 having been at @xmath88  a mere 300 yrs ago , while used _ integral _ data to argue that sgr a@xmath85 was at a 2200 kev luminosity of @xmath89  just 300 to 400 years ago .",
    "this is not quite the luminosity necessary to excite a narrow - line region sufficiently luminous to be detected by an sdss fibre at @xmath90 , but these observations clearly imply that sgr a@xmath85 is active at slightly lower luminosity on short timescales . together with the duty cycle for milky way - like galaxies derived here , these observations may give a first hint of the lifetime of agn in such galaxies . a caveat to this statement is the fact that the luminosity of this very recent flare is still below the agn luminosity limit of our sample .",
    "under what conditions would the black hole at the center of the milky way reach a sufficient luminosity so that it would be included in our agn sample ? to reach a typical luminosity of a few percent eddington @xmath91  bolometric luminosity ) requires a mass - accretion rate of only @xmath92 .",
    "this only a factor 100 higher than bondi accretion rate inferred from simulations , and there are @xmath93  of molecular gas within 2 pc of the central black hole @xcite , with large clouds at further distances",
    ". it would not necessarily be surprising if dynamical friction or a minor merger , e.g. , the swallowing of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy drove some of these clouds in , temporarily re - igniting the black hole at the center of the milky way .",
    "all the ingredients thus appear to be on hand for turning our galaxy into a seyfert agn .",
    "indeed , the mystery may rather be why is our central black hole so dark and why is gas accretion is so infrequent ?",
    "the implication of this work is that the milky way is in a location on the color - mass diagram where late - type galaxies have the highest duty cycle for agn phases .",
    "the mass of the milky way black hole has been inferred to be @xmath94  @xcite which places it in the typical range of black hole masses in late - type galaxies that are currently growing in the local universe ( figure [ fig : sy_mbh ] and [ fig : sy_fmbh ] ) . thus , 5 - 10% duty cycle for galaxies like the milky way places into context the current quiescence of sgr a@xmath85 , together with the evidence for accretion in the recent past and apparently favorable conditions for a resumption of accretion .",
    "in order to understand the co - evolution of galaxies and the supermassive black holes at their centers , we have investigated which galaxies are more likely to host active black holes and how they differ systematically from their normal counterparts , if at all .",
    "we use data from the sloan digital sky survey and visual classifications of morphology from the galaxy zoo project to analyze black hole growth in the nearby universe ( @xmath0 ) and dissect the agn host galaxy population by color , stellar mass and morphology .",
    "we show for the first time the importance of host galaxy morphology for black hole growth and relate it to our understanding of the way in which galaxies and their supermassive black holes co - evolve . in summary :    1 .",
    "we confirm that the selection of agn via emission line diagnostic diagrams may miss low - luminosity agn (  @xmath95 ) in star - forming galaxies",
    "agn host galaxies as a population have high stellar masses around @xmath5 reside in the green valley , and have median black hole masses around  @xmath96 .",
    "3 .   when we divide the agn host galaxy population into early- and late - types , key differences appear .",
    "while both early- and late - type agn host galaxies have similar typical black hole masses and eddington ratios , their stellar masses are different , with the early - type hosts being significantly less massive ( @xmath73 ) than the late - type hosts ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the late - type hosts nevertheless have the same characteristic bulge masses , and therefore black hole masses , as the early - types .",
    "the difference in stellar mass is due to the presence of a massive stellar disk in the late - types .",
    "we consider the fraction of galaxies hosting an agn as a function of black hole mass .",
    "dividing by morphology into early- and late - type galaxies , we find that in early - type galaxies , it is preferentially the galaxies with the _ least massive _ black holes that are active . in late - type galaxies , it is preferentially the _ most massive _ black holes that are active , with a potential drop in the active fraction above (  @xmath97 ) .",
    "we estimate the duty cycle of agn on the color - mass diagram , split by morphology . while some early - type galaxies lie on the red sequence that host agn",
    ", their duty cycle is negligible .",
    "the duty cycle of agn in early - type galaxies is strongly peaked in the green valley below the low - mass end of the red sequence and above the blue cloud .",
    "the duty cycle of agn in late - types , on the other hand , is high in massive green and red late - types . when we impose a minimum eddington ratio cut , we find that only the green valley early - type agn still have a substantial duty cycle .",
    "no part of the late - type population has a high duty cycle of high - eddington ratio accretion .",
    "we discuss the implications of these results for our understanding of the role of agn in the evolution of galaxies .",
    "we conclude , in particular , that _ there are two fundamentally different modes of black hole growth at work in early- and late - type galaxies_. we now have a good understanding of the role of agn in early - type galaxies : the low - mass early - type agn hosts are post - starburst objects moving towards the low - mass end of the red sequence .",
    "they may represent a low - mass , low - luminosity or _ downsized _ version of the mode of evolution that was involved in the formation of more massive early - type galaxies at high redshift .",
    "the role of agn in the evolution of the late - type galaxies is less clear and we offer some possible scenarios .",
    "the high host stellar masses and grand - design stellar disks makes it implausible that they are the product of recent major mergers moving from the blue cloud to the red sequence .",
    "finally , the milky way likely resides in the ` sweet spot ' on the color - mass diagram where the duty cycle of agn is highest amongst late - type galaxies and that the agn duty cycle for galaxies like the milky way is @xmath98 .",
    "we provide the entire agn host galaxy sample used in this paper , including derived properties such as stellar masses , black hole masses , @xmath99 $ ] luminosities and eddington parameters , in table [ tab : cat ] .",
    "this work would not have been possible without the contributions of citizen scientists as part of the galaxy zoo project .",

    "-band luminosity of the quasar and the galaxy template .",
    "this test shows that we are able to recover the stellar mass within 0.2 dex for galaxies at least ten times more luminous in @xmath100 than the quasar .",
    "stellar mass measurements of host galaxies of brighter quasars degrade as the quasar luminosity approaches the host galaxy.[fig : agn_stellarmass],scaledwidth=49.0% ]    the reliability of galaxy parameters determined from spectral energy distribution fitting techniques is limited by uncertainties in the input models and parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as we perform this stellar mass measurement not only for normal galaxies , but also for the host galaxies of obscured agn , we need to assess the effect of he presence of a small amount of agn continuum on stellar mass measurements .",
    "we generate a set of model seds by combining a galaxy template , @xmath101 with a quasar template @xmath102 , ( taken from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and normalising it by a constant @xmath86 to achieve a specific ratio of @xmath103 in order to explore a range of relative luminosities , specified by the constant , @xmath86 :    @xmath104    the galaxy templates used are ssps ( single stellar populations ) with ages of 100 myr ( young ) , 1 gyr ( intermediate ) and 10 gyr ( old ) and a 1 gyr old exponentially declining csp ( composite stellar population ) .",
    "the results of this experiment are shown in figure [ fig : agn_stellarmass ] .",
    "we find that for the older galaxy templates , the stellar mass estimates remain relatively unaffected up to a luminosity ratio of @xmath105 .",
    "the stellar mass estimates for the younger templates begin to become uncertain at the level of @xmath106 dex when @xmath103 reaches @xmath107 , which is likely the maximum amount of contamination that would be expected in our sample .    adding the quasar template to the galaxy is comparable to adding a very young stellar population .",
    "this explains the perhaps counterintuitive outcome of old stellar populations being relatively unaffected - the two - component code identifies the quasar as a small , very young stellar population with a very low mass - to - light ratio and isolates it from the bulk old stellar population .",
    "the sed fitting method has more trouble with galaxy templates where young stellar populations are genuinely present . in this case , the quasar template becomes entangled with the young population and so leads the code to identify a young stellar population of the wrong age and mass - fraction , resulting in a greater uncertainty in the measured stellar mass .",
    "this means that this effect is not a weakness of two - component codes , but a generic problem for all methods .",
    "this experiment implies that the uncertainty introduced by agn is comparable to the other uncertainties that affect stellar mass measurements .",
    "the agn in the relatively local volume probed by our sample are low - luminosity and obscured , so their expected agn continuum contribution is small . as a consequence , the stellar mass estimates of agn host galaxies are approximately as reliable as those of normal galaxies",
    "since liner spectra are preferentially detected in massive red sequence early - type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the exclusion of liners may bias our agn host galaxies sample . if liners are agn , then their implied eddington ratios inferred from  are systematically lower than those of seyferts @xcite .",
    "this implies that their  luminosities are substantially lower for a given black hole mass , which in turn means that the tpyical liner  luminosity is significantly lower than that of seyferts .",
    "in fact , only 19% of all liners detected using our bpt diagrams have  luminosities greater than the completeness limit of @xmath26that we determine in section [ sec : complete ] . in order to test whether our removal of liners from our sample significantly affects our results ,",
    "we perform the following experiment : we include all liners in the agn sample , but remove all objects ( whether classified seyfert or liner ) with @xmath95  ( this removes @xmath6120% of the seyfert sample as well ) .",
    "when we then redo the analysis of this paper using this new sample , we find that all the qualitative trends we describe remain unchanged , and that the quantitative differences are small ."
