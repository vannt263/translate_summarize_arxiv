    "the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ; lilly et al .",
    "1995a ) and other similar surveys have shown evolutionary changes in the field galaxy population over the redshift interval @xmath11 .",
    "at @xmath12 a substantial population of @xmath13 , blue galaxies with small sizes and irregular morphologies ( brinchmann et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter b98 ; lilly et al .  1998",
    "; hereafter l98 ) appears , a population that is largely absent in the local universe .",
    "studies that have provided e.g. , the morphologies and sizes of the @xmath14 field blue galaxies ( e.g. b98 ; l98 ) , and their internal kinematics have suggested that these blue galaxies have generally the irregular morphologies ( b98 ) , small sizes ( 3 - 5 @xmath15 mpc , l98 ) and low velocity dispersions @xmath16 kms@xmath3 ( guzman et al.1997 ; vogt et al .  1997 ; mallen - ornelas et al .",
    "1999 ) that are usually associated in the local universe with galaxies 2 - 3 magnitudes further down the luminosity function .",
    "these results support at first sight a scenario where the @xmath14 blue galaxies are dwarf galaxies substantially brightened by a burst of star formation .",
    "there are still , however , major gaps in our knowledge of galaxies in the @xmath17 redshift regime , and it is possible that this interpretation of the morphologies and the kinematic data is incorrect .",
    "not least , the possibility that the small - blue - irregular galaxies are the cores of more massive galaxies can not be ruled out at this stage .",
    "for example , the @xmath18-band luminosities of typical blue galaxies at @xmath19 are comparable to those of today s massive galaxies , leading to suggestions that at least some of these blue objects may be indeed the progenitors of massive systems ( cowie et al .  1996 ) .",
    "detailed astrophysical diagnostics are needed to discriminate between the two scenarios .",
    "the metallicity of the interstellar medium ( ism ) of distant starforming field galaxies is particularly important , both as a general indicator of the evolutionary state of these systems , and as a constraint on their possible present - day descendants .",
    "no information has been available about the ism metallicities of galaxies in the @xmath0 redshift regime .",
    "we have therefore begun a program of systematic emission line spectroscopy of cfrs galaxies to determine their ism metallicity , and to study how the metal content in these systems correlates with galaxy luminosity , star - formation rate , structure and morphology .",
    "our program uses the @xmath203727 + [ oiii]4959 + 5007)/h\\beta$ ] metallicity estimator ( pagel et al .",
    "1979 ; see also kobulnicky et al .",
    "1999 for a detailed description of the potential accuracy that can be obtained in using @xmath1 to measure metallicities of unresolved galaxies at high redshifts ) .",
    "the lines required to measure @xmath1 are shifted into the 5000 @xmath21 - 1 @xmath22 m wavelength region for @xmath23 .",
    "a reversal in @xmath1 occurs however at @xmath24 due to cooling effects ( so a low- and a high - metallicity solution are associated with most values of @xmath1 ) , and the [ oiii]5007/[nii]6584 ratio is required to break this degeneracy ( kobulnicky et al .",
    "our program therefore includes supplementary spectroscopy of h@xmath25 , [ nii]6584 and [ sii]6717,6731 lines ( which , for @xmath23 , are shifted into the near - infrared @xmath4-band ) for reddening determinations , agn discrimination and breaking of the @xmath1-degeneracy with metallicity through the [ oiii]/[nii ] ratio .    in this paper",
    "we use deep @xmath26 m multi - object spectrophotometry collected at the canada - france - hawaii telescope in march 2000 ( already published in carollo & lilly 2001 ) , and refer to complementary @xmath4-band spectroscopy that we have in the meanwhile acquired with nirspec at keck for five objects in the optical sample ( in preparation ) .",
    "we use @xmath27 mpc / km / s and @xmath28",
    "the target galaxies were selected from the cfrs to have , in addition to the original @xmath29 photometric selection , an [ oii]3727 flux @xmath30 erg s@xmath3@xmath31 , so as to ensure strong enough lines for a measurement of the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "34 such objects were observed in our first cfht observing run .",
    "the h@xmath32 luminosity is however likely to be better related to the star - formation rate than the [ oii ] flux .",
    "unfortunately , h@xmath32 measurements were not available beforehand , so an approximation to an @xmath33-luminosity selected sample could only be constructed a posteriori . the current optical analysis is therefore based on the 15 out of 34 objects with h@xmath32 luminosities above @xmath34 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "this high-@xmath8 selection well samples the ` blue ' starforming cfrs galaxy population .",
    "three high redshift galaxies in the original sample of 34 had upper limits to their h@xmath32 luminosities which were above our @xmath35 erg s@xmath3 threshold , possibly putting these systems into the high-@xmath8 sub - sample that is discussed in this paper .",
    "the line ratios for these galaxies are necessarily uncertain ; however , we have included these systems in the figures for completeness , and assigned to them the range of line ratios that they would have if their h@xmath32 luminosities were indeed above our threshold .",
    "we have however identified these three objects with different symbols , as a reminder that they may well not belong to the high-@xmath8 sub - sample .",
    "figures 1a and 1b show the [ oiii]5007/[oii]3727 versus @xmath1 relation for the local field sample of jansen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and the high-@xmath8 cfrs galaxies of our sample , respectively . in the figures ,",
    "the solid and dashed lines are lines of constant metallicity . from left to right",
    ", the dashed lines indicate increasing metallicities from 0.02@xmath10 to 0.2@xmath10 . at @xmath36 ,",
    "the reversal of @xmath1 occurs , and the curves of constant metallicity then follow the solid - line sequence in which @xmath37 rises up to about 3@xmath10 from right back to left .",
    "the @xmath38 curve is highlighted with a thicker linewidth . in order to appropriately compare the local and the high@xmath39 samples , the local jansen et al.galaxies which have l@xmath40 ergs s@xmath3",
    "are identified with large circles ; local galaxies with smaller @xmath33 luminosities are represented by small circles .",
    "furthermore , in figure 1a , filled symbols represent objects which have a flux ratio @xmath415007/[nii]6584 > 2 $ ] and thus metallicities @xmath42 , and empty symbols indicate objects with higher metallicities , as indicated by a flux ratio @xmath415007/[nii]6584 < 2 $ ] ( see edmunds & pagel 1984 ) . in figure 1b ,",
    "the high@xmath39 galaxies are represented by the filled squares , with the exception of the three objects which may or may not be in the sample on account of their h@xmath32 upper limits ( empty squares ) .",
    "the fiducial dotted - line box in both panels encompasses the bulk of the jansen s galaxies .",
    "the arrows represent the direction in which the points of the diagram would shift due to reddening by dust ( as described by cardelli et al .",
    "1989 ) ; the length of the arrows refer to an @xmath43 magnitudes at @xmath44 .",
    "the high redshift galaxies fall in the @xmath1 versus [ oiii]/[oii ] plane in locations that are occupied by galaxies in the local jansen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) sample .",
    "furthermore , most of the high redshift sample selected to have @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 occupies the same restricted location in the @xmath1 versus [ oiii]/[oii ] plane as do the objects in the local universe with similarly high @xmath33 luminosities . at both epochs ,",
    "galaxies selected to have the same h@xmath32 luminosities exhibit the same range of @xmath1 and [ oiii]/[oii ] .",
    "two objects have , within the error bars , @xmath45 , the value that is non - degeneratively associated with intermediate metallicities @xmath24 .",
    "these two objects were excluded from the discussion in carollo & lilly ( 2001 ) due to their [ neiii]3869 emission that made them good candidates for agn activity .",
    "the @xmath37-degenerate @xmath1 values that are measured for the remaining high-@xmath39 galaxies indicate either rather low ( @xmath46 ) or rather high ( @xmath47 ) metallicities for these systems .",
    "the similarity between most of the high - redshift galaxies and the low - redshift sample is further illustrated in figure 2 , which shows the relationship between @xmath1 and continuum luminosity m@xmath48 .",
    "there is a startling similarity between the high-@xmath39 and the local galaxies on this diagram .",
    "there is little evidence for an evolutionary change in the relationship between metallicity ( as estimated from @xmath1 ) and the line and continuum luminosities for high-@xmath8 field galaxies between @xmath49 and @xmath12 .",
    "the two [ neiii ] emitters are the only two systems out of 15 which may indicate a different relationship , i.e. one produced by substantial brightening of lower @xmath37 systems .",
    "@xmath4-band spectroscopy is available for five of the 15 galaxies , including the two [ neiii ] emitters .",
    "these new data provide the intensity of the [ nii]6584 emission line , and enable us to compute the degeneracy - breaking [ oiii]5007/[nii]6584 ratio .",
    "three of the five objects have [ oiii]5007/[nii]6584 ratios that undoubtedly place them on the high - metallicity branch of the @xmath1 parameter , with a metallicity of @xmath7 up to solar .",
    "the remaining two objects are the two [ neiii ] emitters , which are proven to be ` normal ' star forming galaxies ( rather than agn ) and confirmed to have the intermediate , @xmath24 value indicated , within the errorbars , by the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "the near - infrared data therefore demonstrate a high , i.e. about solar metallicity for at least some objects in our @xmath50 high-@xmath8 sample .",
    "the hst morphology of one of these high - metallicity objects is that of a regular two - armed spiral ( schade et al .",
    "1995 ) , and so it is possibly not surprising that this galaxy has a high metal content",
    ". it may be that our high-@xmath8 selection favours large well - formed galaxies relative to the general blue cfrs population . however , there is no indication that this is the case from the hst morphology of three additional objects for which the hst data are available ( lilly & carollo 2001 ) .",
    "more importantly , a second object among the three with confirmed high metallicity and hst morphology shows the irregularity and compactness typical of the blue galaxy population at those redshifts .    of course",
    ", until we obtain the infrared spectroscopy for the entire sample , the @xmath1 degeneracy with @xmath37 does not allow us to prove on what branch i.e .",
    ", the low- or the high - metallicity one each individual high-@xmath39 galaxy lies , and the possibility remains that some objects have indeed very low metallicities @xmath51 , making them strong candidates for star bursting dwarfs . however , at this stage , the confirmation that at least a large fraction of the high-@xmath8 @xmath23 star forming galaxies has high metallicities within @xmath52 - 50% of solar contrast the idea that these systems are all low mass , i.e. , low metallicity dwarfs brightened by substantial luminosity evolution . in contrast , the metallicity data seem to suggest that at least a large fraction of these small irregular galaxies are in fact the progenitors of today s massive , metal - rich galaxies , but seen in an earlier phase of their evolution when they were already significantly metal - rich but morphologically more disturbed and smaller .",
