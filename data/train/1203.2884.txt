    "most importantly , they feature long - range van der waals ( vdw ) interactions , which lead to interesting effects like the dipole blockade  @xcite . after initial work",
    "mainly concerned with bulk properties of rydberg ensembles , current effort focuses more and more on spatially resolved observations .",
    "this is motivated not least by experimental progress  @xcite and theoretical proposals  @xcite for spatially resolved excitation imaging . also on the theoretical side , in particular rate equation models  @xcite and full many - body simulations on truncated hilbert spaces",
    "@xcite provide a handle to access spatially resolved properties .    in this spirit",
    ", it has been predicted that spatial pair correlations can be induced in a three - level rydberg gas via the so - called anti - blockade arising from resonant excitations due to single - atom autler - townes splitting  @xcite .",
    "these correlations could be measured based on mechanical forces due to the vdw interaction .",
    "the induced particle motion leads to an encoding of position correlations into a time - dependent penning ionization signal  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in this way , spatial information is gained without a spatially resolved measurement . following these works on spatial properties of pairs of rydberg atoms in large ensembles , it was subsequently shown that also the rydberg ensemble as a whole could form crystalline structures in the rydberg excitation density  @xcite . in a repulsive vdw gas of rydberg atoms",
    ", it can be energetically favorable for a given number of excitations to assume a highly ordered , crystalline state , with distances between the excitations maximized . if the laser detuning acts opposite to the interaction contribution , these ordered states become the quantum mechanical ground state of the system .",
    "it was proposed that such ground - state crystals ( gsc ) could be produced using chirped laser pulses  @xcite .",
    "the chirp of the laser driving induces adiabatic passage to the energetically most favorable state corresponding to the crystalline excitation structure . for dipole - dipole interacting spins in a lattice configuration",
    "a scheme for growing ordered structures by using resonant excitation processes similar to the ones discussed here has been proposed recently @xcite . here",
    ", we study regular excitation structures that arise in an off - resonantly driven disordered gas at fixed laser detuning . we analyze in detail the spatially resolved properties of a one - dimensional disordered gas of rydberg atoms via numerical simulations on a truncated hilbert space .",
    "the regular structures or aggregates predicted here are fundamentally different from the gsc reported previously .",
    "first , the characteristic distances between excitations do not depend on the trap geometry , but only on the laser detuning and interaction potential .",
    "second , the structures are not spatially localized with respect to the trap , but can float over a certain position range between different realizations .",
    "third , global observables , such as the excitation number or the mandel @xmath0 parameter yield results qualitatively different from those for the gsc .",
    "also , due to the floating nature of the aggregates , the total and the excitation - number resolved spatial excitation densities exhibit characteristic structures .",
    "methods to experimentally verify the aggregate structure are discussed .",
    "the underlying resonant excitation mechanism is dynamical , inviting time - resolved studies of the formation of spatial correlations .",
    "part of our predictions can already be probed through the detuning and density dependence of the bulk total number of excitations without the need for spatial resolution .",
    "we find that two characteristic lengths arise in an off - resonantly excited gas .",
    "these length have a fixed ratio of @xmath2 for an interaction potential @xmath3 and can be explained by two different resonant excitation channels connected to one - photon and two - photon processes , respectively . as an application",
    ", we show this unique property can be used to construct a quantum gate .",
    "we find that the gate fidelity sensitively depends on the specific geometric arrangement of the excited atoms .",
    "high fidelity is achieved , as our resonant excitation scheme automatically self - assembles the optimum arrangement out of a homogeneous cloud of atoms , independent of the laser parameters .",

    "we assume temporally and spatially constant laser intensity and wavelength .",

    "the first part of this hamiltonian contains a sum over single - atom contributions .",

    "the second part accounts for the vdw interactions between two atoms in the rydberg state at a mutual distance @xmath13 .",
    "we numerically solve the time dependent schrdinger equation with hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) for given atom positions @xmath14 and parameters @xmath15 , @xmath12 and @xmath9 , starting from an initial state with all atoms in the ground state .",
    "for a many - body system , a naive integration is impractical , as the number of states grows exponentially with the particle number .",
    "we overcome this problem by exploiting the rydberg blockade to truncate the hilbert space to a physically relevant subspace  @xcite .",

    "this choice , however is not restrictive since the results can be mapped to any other parameter values by rescaling time and length . for these parameters ,",

    "[ fig : g2 ] reveals a sequence of double resonances .",
    "the first resonance at lowest interparticle distance is the well - known resonant pair excitation  @xcite in which the ground state is resonantly coupled to a doubly excited state via two - photon excitation if @xmath35 .",
    "we identified the second maximum at slightly higher @xmath20 as the resonant transition from an @xmath36-fold to an @xmath36 + 1-fold excited state , satisfying @xmath37 .",
    "the two conditions are shown as dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2](a ) and coincide very well with the maxima of @xmath31 from the numerical simulation results .",
    "we can thus directly trace back the emergence of spatial correlations to resonant excitation channels . starting from a doubly - excited state with interatomic distance @xmath38 , a triply excited state emerges .",
    "this is also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bare_states_pot](a ) where we show the bare energies ( diagonal elements of the hamiltonian ) as a function of the detuning .",
    "it can be seen that , as long as the density of states is sufficiently high around zero energy , pair states and triplet states are available that can be excited resonantly . for the later analysis it is crucial to note that due to the mutual interaction shifts , the third atom has distance @xmath39 , such that an asymmetric three - particle structure is created .",
    "this triplet causes the third resonance line at @xmath40 in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2](a ) .",
    "subsequent resonances originate from higher - excited states , which most likely occur again at distances @xmath41 from the respective previous structures . in total , for highly excited states , a regular chain of atoms with a single `` defect '' formed by the initial pair of atoms is created .     as a function of the laser detuning .",
    "we used a sample of @xmath42 atoms randomly placed in a one - dimensional trap .",
    "the energy of @xmath36-fold excited states decreases with slope @xmath36 .",
    "the solid red ( upper gray ) and black lines mark states that can be resonantly coupled to from the ground state for a certain detuning @xmath9 .",

    "interestingly , the triply excited state is distinguished by a ratio @xmath44 for an interaction potential @xmath3 , independent of the trap size and the laser parameters . in this sense , the interaction potential leads to a self - assembly of asymmetric excitation structures .",
    "this invites applications exploiting the robust and definite asymmetric spatial configuration with distances @xmath45 and @xmath38 between the excitations , created out of a homogeneous cloud of atoms .",
    "an example for this will be discussed in sec .  [",

    "@xmath46 is the corresponding parameter evaluated without the ground state fraction .",

    "@xmath15 and @xmath48 are as in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2 ] . ]",
    "next , we analyze the structure of the spatial correlations at high detunings in more detail .",
    "figure  [ fig : g2](b ) shows that the pair correlation resonances become narrower with increasing detuning .",
    "the origin of this effect is illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : bare_states_pot](b ) .",
    "the resonances are of lorentzian shape in energy space as a function of the detuning .",
    "the interaction potential @xmath49 translates this dependence on the detuning into a distance dependence . for the same energy - resonance width",
    ", the position - space resonances become narrower as the distance decreases at which the laser moves into resonance .",
    "hence , an increase of the detuning leads to a reduction of the resonant width . for the particular case of a two - photon resonance ,",
    "the energetic resonance width depends on the detuning itself . to quantify this , we adiabatically eliminate the singly excited states in the two - atom problem .",
    "this is valid if @xmath9 is much larger than both , @xmath12 and the two photon detuning @xmath50 .",
    "the resulting effective rabi frequency is @xmath51 , which means that the full width of the resonance with respect to the two photon detuning ( power broadening ) is @xmath52 . linearizing the potential around @xmath38 we obtain the position - space width of the two photon resonance @xmath53 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bare_states_pot](b ) , the numerical simulation data fully agrees with eq .  ( [ eq : res_width ] ) up to an overall prefactor of about 2 due to additional atoms in the trap which broaden the resonance compared to the idealized two - atom case .",
    "note that , since the potential is not strictly linear across the width of the resonance , the spatial shape of the resonance peaks is asymmetric .    in summary",
    ", we find that in the limit of large @xmath9 , the position - space two - photon resonance width decreases as @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , in our model , resonant excitations are only possible at definite positions with lattice spacings determined by the shape of the interaction potential . in the limit of large detuning all features of the pair correlation function can be understood in terms of two - atom properties .",
    "after having established the formation of stronger spatial ordering with increasing detuning , we now address the question how this ordering manifests itself in various observables related to the spatial distribution of rydberg excitations .",
    "we start with the number of rydberg excitations @xmath55 .",
    "[ fig : q_nex](a ) shows that @xmath55 increases with detuning starting from the resonant case , at some positive detuning assumes a maximum , and then decreases towards larger values of @xmath9 .",
    "the initial increase can be attributed to the presence of the off - resonant excitation channels at positive detuning , which also lead to a better packing of the rydberg excitations .",
    "but with increasing detuning , the spatial excitation resonances become more narrow , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bare_states_pot](b ) .",
    "therefore , the number of atom pairs with distance compatible with the resonant distance reduces .",
    "consequently , starting from a certain critical detuning , the total number of excited atoms decreases with increasing @xmath9 . for higher densities",
    ", this effect is expected to set in at higher detunings , since at a given resonance width , the number of pairs having a distance within the resonant range increases with density .",
    "this is supported by our numerical simulation data , as the maximum of the number of rydberg excitations @xmath55 is shifted to higher detunings for higher densities , see fig .",
    "[ fig : q_nex](a ) .",
    "next we investigate the distribution of the number of excitations , which is characterized by the mandel @xmath0 parameter @xmath56 for a poissonian distribution of excitation numbers , like in a coherent state , the @xmath0 parameter is zero , while for sub - poissonian statistics it is negative . in previous proposals on gsc , for a given detuning , a definite number of excitations was predicted in the system .",
    "then , ideally @xmath0 reaches the value @xmath57 for a fock state .",
    "in contrast , fig .  [",
    "fig : q_nex](b ) shows that in our setup , the @xmath0 parameter assumes a minimum at a detuning close to that of the maximum in @xmath58 , but then increases again towards larger @xmath9 .",
    "the interpretation of this result is related to the behavior of @xmath58 .",
    "initially , the off - resonant channels for ordered excitation structures lead to a decrease of @xmath0 .    but towards larger detunings , i.e. , smaller resonance widths , there is an increasing probability that there are few or even no atom pairs at the resonant distance in the ensemble .",
    "furthermore , the spatial width of the resonant pair excitation ( aggregate nucleation ) decreases faster with the detuning than the width for subsequent resonant excitation of further atoms ( aggregate growth ) .",
    "therefore , once a resonant pair is excited , there is a high probability that further atoms connected to this initial seed are excited subsequently .",
    "this then leads to a non - zero probability to detect no exciation at all and at the same time to the emergence of aggregates of size two and higher , while the population of singly excited states is very low .",
    "a signature for this effect is that at large detunings , the system evolves into a bimodal excitation distribution , with one fraction in the ground state , and the second fraction distributed around a parameter - dependent excitation number .",
    "this observation is supported by corresponding results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : q_nex](b ) for @xmath46 , which is the ordinary @xmath0 parameter evaluated without the ground state fraction .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath46 remains low even for higher detunings @xmath9 .",
    "we thus conclude that in the present case of off - resonantly excited rydberg gases , super - poissonian rather than sub - poissonian excitation number statistics are a sign of ordered structures and the buildup of strong correlations , in contrast to the properties of the gsc .",

    "( b ) excitation density for @xmath60 split into excitation - number subspaces . ]",
    "the sharply peaked @xmath31-function in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2 ] indicated that the distances between excitations predominantly are multiples of the resonant excitation distances .",
    "but interestingly , this does not translate into a peaked structure in the spatially resolved excitation density .",
    "[ fig : nex_z](a ) shows that at low detuning ( @xmath61 ) , as is well - known @xcite , an enhancement of the population occurs close to the trap edges . in a simple blockade picture ,",
    "this is due to the fact that for an atom close to the trap edge , the probability to be blockaded by a nearby excitation is smaller since less atoms are present in its vicinity . at high detuning , the excitation density has a rather complicated step - like dependence on the position and the trap edges become depleted .",
    "this can be explained with a geometric argument : if we consider , e.g. , the doubly excited states , we notice that these are only populated if the distance between the excited atoms is the resonant one .",
    "if we now ask how such a pair of excitations with fixed distance can be placed in the 1d ensemble volume , and assume that each of these possibilities is realized with equal probability , it becomes clear that atoms located within one resonant radius from the ends of the trap are excited only half as often as atoms at the center .",
    "this explains the outermost edges in the excitation density .",
    "the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : nex_z](a ) indicates the position @xmath38 away from one edge of the ensemble coinciding with the position of the step in excitation density , clearly supporting this interpretation .",
    "the other edges can be explained analogously , taking into account higher excited states .",
    "this is also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : nex_z](b ) in which the excitation density is split up into contributions of states with different excitation numbers .",
    "e.g. , the plateau - structure of the doubly excited states confirms the above reasoning . in higher dimensions",
    "the condition of resonant excitation is fulfilled for various positions of the third excitation and thus it is less localized .",
    "these results indicate a second fundamental difference of the regular structures found in our setup from previous proposals .",
    "the gsc are located at fixed positions relative to the trap borders . in our case , however , the resonant excitation structures are not fixed relative to the ensemble , but can _ float _ over a certain position range in the atom gas from realization to realization .",

    "[ fig : res_width_cryst ] could be performed . in each run , a certain excitation pattern is obtained . to compensate for the floating , the positions of the leftmost excited atoms in the different runs are matched by a shift of the position axis .",
    "then , the shifted data of the different runs are averaged .",

    "times the correlation peaks build up successively .",
    "remarkably , after 500ns",
    "the qualitative features of the steady - state situation are present already . thereafter , only the absolute height of the peaks increases .",
    "this successive buildup of correlation peaks can be attributed to a finite propagation speed of entanglement , that was studied in lattice geometries recently @xcite .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : res_width_cryst ] that the correlations decrease with increasing distance , unlike in an ideal crystal .",
    "but the correlations extend over a multiple of the interaction length scale .",
    "in consistence with our interpretations , we found that the characteristic distances between excitations are independent of the ensemble volume .",
    "we now turn to a specific application exploiting the spatially asymmetric excitation structure , and show that the generated spatial structures are optimal in the sense that they maximize the success probability of our proposed application . for this",
    "we consider an implementation of a three - particle quantum gate  @xcite .",
    "based on the approach used in ref .",
    "@xcite , the excitation structure generated in the first step can be isolated by removing ground state atoms with a resonant laser pulse , and subsequently mapped onto ground states by resonantly driving a transition to a rapidly decaying @xmath63-state .",
    "that way , a spatial arrangement of ground state atoms is prepared , that corresponds to one specific realization of the original excitation structure . in the case",
    "that three atoms survive this procedure , their mutual distances are @xmath38 , @xmath45 , and @xmath64 , and we denote the three atoms as @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 as indicated in fig .",

    "furthermore , already small deviations in the optimum distance @xmath89 lead to a significant degradation of the gate fidelity . in our setup",
    "this optimum distance is automatically achieved for each given laser detuning , because the resonantly excited correlated structures are created with atomic distances such that the laser detuning condition required for the gate operation is satisfied .",
    "it is in this sense , that the self - assembly of the excitation structures is optimal .",
    "an obvious drawback of the proposed scheme is , that after generating the resonantly excited triples out of a homogeneous sample , one does not know where exactly the atoms are localized due to the floating nature of the excitation structures .",

    "a solution could be to use a dense sample in a small trap that accommodates at most 3 excitations , such that the range for the floating is smaller than the distances between the excitations .",

    "alternatively , one could use a lattice geometry for the whole protocol .",
    "this would have the advantage that after preparing the asymmetric structure , one could determine the positions of the individual atoms , e.g. , by fluorescence imaging .",

    "it has been show recently that this can deteriorate the resonant pair excitation mechanism @xcite . in our case",
    "it would probably lead to a further broadening of the position space resonances and also to additional dephasing effects  @xcite during the gate operation , since for the initial state @xmath95 and @xmath78 , the state @xmath96 is temporarily populated , which suffers from the repulsion between atoms @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the consistent inclusion of motional degrees of freedom in a many - body system of long range interacting atoms , however , remains an unresolved challenge .",
    "in summary , we have shown that regular rydberg excitation structures form at off - resonant laser driving .",
    "these structures differ from previously studied ground state crystals , as their characteristic distances are independent of the ensemble length , as they are not localized relative to the gas , and as the mandel @xmath0 parameter , the rydberg excitation density and the total number of rydberg excitations yield qualitatively different results . we have shown how these structures build up dynamically and found that the ratio of the two different emerging characteristic lengths depends on the interaction potential only .    as an application",
    ", we have shown that excitation structures generated by off - resonant laser driving can be used to implement an efficient three - qubit quantum gate , because the excitation scheme automatically generates an asymmetric spatial arrangement out of a homogeneous atom cloud such that an optimum gate operation is achieved for the given laser parameters .",

    "this way , the shift of the maximum of the rydberg excitation to higher detunings with increasing density and the increasingly super - poissonian excitation statistics at very high detuning could be verified as a first manifestation of the resonant excitation channels .",
    "a position - resolved measurement of the excitations would allow to verify the predicted resonance peaks in @xmath31 , and the formation of the ordered structure as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : g2tdep ] . by determining the position of the resonances as a function of the detuning , also the precise structure of the interaction potential could be probed .",
    "furthermore , the spatial dependence of the various excitation - number subspaces arising from the floating nature of our aggregates could be analyzed .",
    "realizing an excitation volume with sharp boundaries , for example by using flat top beams , one could investigate the enhanced excitation density close to the trap border in the case of resonant excitation which is suppressed in the far off - resonant case ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nex_z ] ) .",
    "the resonant excitation aggregates are formed dynamically throughout the time evolution and do not require a thermalization of the system .",
    "this invites a time - resolved study of the dynamic formation of spatial correlations .    in approximately 1d systems or higher - dimensional systems ,",
    "the higher - order resonance conditions do not uniquely determine the positions of all involved particles .",
    "this leads to a broadening of the corresponding resonances in @xmath31 .",
    "also decoherence due to spontaneous emission , finite laser linewidth , or effects of atomic motion will lead to a broadening of the resonance peaks in @xmath31 .",
    "all these effects lead to a suppression of the resonant two photon processes compared to the off - resonant single photon excitation , which sets limits to the observation of higher - order resonance peaks in experiments .",
    "finally , we note that very recently , super - poissonian excitation statistics have been observed in experiments operating at off - resonant driving in the strongly dissipative regime @xcite .",
    "we expect that the mechanism of aggregate formation discussed here leading to a bimodal distribution of excitation numbers still applies in the presence of substantial decoherence .",
    "the main difference would be that , rather than resonantly excited pairs , off - resonantly excited single atoms function as initial grains for the aggregate formation  @xcite .",
