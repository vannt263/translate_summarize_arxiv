    "the power grid is designed to operate optimally at a nominal frequency and in a balanced fashion  @xcite .",
    "deviations from the nominal nominal frequency and unbalanced operating conditions can adversely affect the performance of different components of the power grid such as compensators and loads  @xcite-@xcite , resulting in harmful operating conditions that can propagate throughout the network .",
    "therefore , monitoring frequency and phasor information of three - phase power distribution networks in real - time is a prerequisite for ensuring nominal operating conditions .",
    "moreover , the system frequency reveals essential information about the dynamics of the power grid .",
    "for example , a rising system frequency indicates that power generation has surpassed power consumption and a falling system frequency is indicative of power consumption exceeding power generation .",

    "most approaches for estimating the frequency of three - phase power systems are either based on real - valued algorithms and use measurements from a single phase or use the clarke transform to map voltage measurements from all three phases on top the complex domain and use standard linear complex - valued algorithms and are shown to be accurate under nominal operating conditions ; however , under unbalanced operating conditions these approaches can lead to non - unique solutions and suffer from large oscillatory errors  @xcite-@xcite . to address this issue , frequency estimators based on widely linear complex signal processing algorithms",
    "have been developed  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "although mapping the three - phase voltages onto the complex domain allows for the use of well established complex - valued signal processing techniques ; however , complex numbers lack the dimensionality necessary to model three - phase systems which leads to partial loss of information specially under unbalanced operating conditions .",

    "the new derivation provides a better insight to the physical interpretation of the elements of the state space vector that is then exploited to estimate the phasors of each phase .",
    "the resulting estimator can fully characterize three - phase systems , operates optimally under both balanced and unbalanced conditions , and eliminates the need to use the clark transform .",
