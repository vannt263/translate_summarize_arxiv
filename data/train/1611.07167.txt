    "the dis region is understood to be the kinematic region with the center of mass energy w @xmath5 2.0 @xmath6 and @xmath7 1.0 @xmath8 .",
    "recently jlab has performed experiments using continuous electron beam facility with energies in the range of approximately 2 - 6 @xmath6 , and precise measurements have been performed for the structure functions @xmath9 , @xmath10 , longitudinal structure function @xmath11 extending to low @xmath3(@xmath12 ) using several nuclear targets  @xcite .",
    "the modification of structure function in nuclear medium has also been studied earlier by nmc  @xcite , jlab  @xcite , slac  @xcite , bcdms  @xcite , etc .",
    "collaborations , in some nuclear targets .",
    "jlab also plans to upgrade electron beam energy to 12 gev and perform the experiments using several nuclear targets .",
    "jlab experiment , has observed that bloom - gilman duality to work even at @xmath13 or may be less than @xmath14 , which means that resonance structure function averaged over the scaling variable is almost equal to the deep inelastic structure function . in the weak sector , several experiments have been performed  @xcite and few others are going on to study neutrino oscillation physics while some of them like miner@xmath15a  @xcite and dune  @xcite are specially designed to precisely measure neutrino and antineutrino cross sections in the dis region on some nuclear targets .",
    "one of the major source of systematic errors in all the neutrino oscillation experiments being performed in the few gev energy region ( @xmath16 @xmath6 ) arises due to lack of the understanding of nuclear medium effects(nme ) in the neutrino / antineutrino - nucleus scattering cross section .",
    "there are many theoretical calculations of nme in quasielastic(qe ) , inelastic(ie ) scattering and deep - inelastic scattering(dis ) processes which give the uncertainty bands in the neutrino - nucleus cross sections arising due to nme .",
    "many efforts have been made in the last one decade to understand medium effects in the quasielastic and one pion production processes arising from neutrino / antineutrino interactions from nuclear targets , not many attempts have been made to understand medium effects in the dis region . despite of these efforts , the cross sections have still an uncertainty of 20 - 30@xmath17 and a better understanding of nme would play decisive role in the study of cp violation in the leptonic sector or in very precise determination of oscillation parameters . to understand nme in the dis region ,",
    "two different approaches are adopted , one is a phenomenological approach and the other is a theoretical approach . in the phenomenological analysis",
    "there are few approaches for determining nuclear pdfs . in most pdf analyses ,",
    "the nuclear correction factors were taken from lepton - nucleus and p - nucleus scattering data , some of them also include drell - yan data as well as ( anti)neutrino - nucleus scattering data .",
    "most of the studies like of eskola et al .",
    "@xcite and de florian et al .",
    "@xcite do not find a difference in the nuclear correction factor obtained using @xmath18 and @xmath19 scattering data .",
    "however , recent studies by cteq - grenoble - karlsruhe collaboration ( ncteq )  @xcite have shown that the nuclear correction factor is different in electromagnetic(em ) interaction vs weak interaction .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand the nature of differences in electromagnetic and weak structure functions as well as to understand the violation of callan - gross relation in nuclei due to nme .",
    "the basic reaction for charged / neutral lepton induced dis process on bound nucleons , in nuclear target is given by @xmath20 for which the leptonic tensor @xmath21 and the nuclear hadronic tensor @xmath22 is @xmath23 which is expressed in terms of nuclear structure functions @xmath24 where @xmath25 for em interaction and @xmath26 for weak interaction .",
    "in the case of electromagnetic interaction the antisymmetric term of leptonic tensor(eq.[eq : lmunu ] ) and the parity violating term of hadronic tensor(eq.[eq : wamunu_weak ] ) do not contribute .",
    "these structure functions are expressed in terms of dimensionless nuclear structure functions as @xmath27 we have performed the numerical calculations in the local density approximation and obtained the nuclear hadronic tensor in terms of hole spectral function(@xmath28 ) and nucleon hadronic tensor using which the expression of nuclear structure functions for nonisoscalar nuclear target are obtained as  @xcite @xmath29,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath30~\\times\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left(\\frac{m_n}{p_0~-~p_z~\\gamma}\\right ) ~f_2^{\\tau , em , weak}(x_n , q^2 ) ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the nucleon mass , @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the nuclear density , @xmath34 , @xmath28 is the hole spectral function which takes into account the effect of fermi motion , binding energy and nucleon correlations , the expression for which is taken from ref .",
    "@xciteand @xmath35 is the nucleon structure function which are expressed in terms of parton distribution functions(pdfs ) .",
    "the only difference in obtaining the expressions of weak and em nuclear structure functions comes from the nucleon pdfs and intermediate boson self energy . in a similar way",

    "we have used the pdfs given by gluck et al .",

    "we find that the results at lo with spectral function is about 18@xmath17 smaller at x=0.2 in comparison to the results obtained using the full model at @xmath48 .",
    "this difference decreases with the increase in x , for example at x=0.4 , it is 12@xmath17 and becomes almost negligible at x=0.6 . when the results obtained by using the full model at nlo are compared with the results evaluated at lo , we find that there is decrease in the results from the lo values .",

    "the results are also presented by using the nuclear pdfs cj12min  @xcite for fix value of strong coupling constant as well as for @xmath3 evolution . from the figure",
    "one may observe that the results obtained with nucleon pdfs cteq6.6 are different than the results obtained using nuclear pdfs cj12min .",
    "it is also noticeable that at low @xmath2 , em structure function is slightly lower than the weak structure function which is about @xmath50 in iron at @xmath51 , and for higher values of @xmath52 it becomes almost negligible .",
    "however , for the heavier nuclear targets the difference in em and weak structure functions is found to be large .    in the right panel of fig.[fig3 ] , the ratio of nuclear structure functions @xmath53 is shown for carbon at @xmath54 .",
    "it may be observed that the ratio is less than unity and further suppressed when we apply a cut of 2 @xmath6 on cm energy @xmath55 .",
    "hence , from the results it may be concluded that callan - gross(cg ) relation deviates inside the nuclear medium .",
    "these results are also in agreement with the jlab data  @xcite .",

    "[ fig4 ] , we show the results for the ratio @xmath57 in various nuclear targets like @xmath46 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath47 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 at @xmath63 .",
    "it may be noticed from the figure that nonisoscalarity effect is larger for heavier nuclear targets like @xmath61 and @xmath62 which implies that the difference in charm and strange quark distributions could be significant for heavy nuclei .",

    "the results are obtained for m=4.5 , 5.5 , 6.5 and 7.5 @xmath6 in carbon at center of mass energy @xmath68 and compared with the e772 data  @xcite .",
    "we find that the nuclear structure effects due to bound nucleon lead to a suppression in the dy yield of about @xmath69 in @xmath46 in the region of @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , we find that there is a significant contribution of mesons which increases the dy ratio i.e. its effect is opposite to the effect of spectral function .",
    "for example , the dy yield increases by around @xmath71 for @xmath70 in @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , we observe that the effect is more at low @xmath64(@xmath72 ) than at high @xmath64 .",
    "we find the contribution from rho meson cloud to be much smaller than the contribution from pion cloud . when the shadowing corrections are included there is further suppression in the dy yield and it is effective in the low region of @xmath73 .",
    "the effect of beam energy loss is also to reduce the dy yield .",
    "both effects add to the suppression obtained using spectral function , where as the mesonic effects lead to an enhancement .",
    "the net effect of shadowing and the energy loss effect is to reduce the dy yield by about @xmath74 at @xmath75 in @xmath46 which becomes @xmath76 at @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "from the present study we may conclude the following :    1 .   the nuclear structure functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 are different due to nuclear medium effects and as a consequence of which callan - gross relation deviates inside the nuclear medium .",
    "2 .   due to the nuclear medium effects , we found the difference in @xmath81 and @xmath82 structure functions in the region of low @xmath2 which vanishes for high x values .",
    "we have also found the difference between the nuclear structure functions obtained by using nucleon and nuclear parton distribution functions .",
    "4 .   in the case of drell - yan process",
    "both the reduction as well as the enhancement due to the nuclear structure effect , shadowing and mesonic cloud contribution , are found to be of similar magnitude as in the case of dis of charged leptons ."
