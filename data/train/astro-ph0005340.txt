    "the discovery and characterization of `` lyman - break '' galaxies ( lbgs ) has opened a new window on the high - redshift universe , revealing a population of star - forming galaxies at @xmath8 whose comoving space density exceeds that of @xmath9 galaxies today @xcite . these galaxies can be identified by their unusual colors in deep imaging surveys because the intrinsic continuum break at @xmath10  and the intergalactic absorption by the ly@xmath3  forest at @xmath11  redshift into optical bands .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up shows that photometry of lyman - break objects yields robust approximate redshifts . from an optical imaging survey",
    ", one can therefore construct a sample of high-@xmath12 galaxies limited primarily by rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) luminosity , which , in the absence of dust extinction , is itself determined mainly by the instantaneous formation rate of massive stars .",
    "application of this approach to the hubble deep field ( hdf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and other deep imaging surveys has yielded first attempts at one of the long - standing goals of observational cosmology , determination of the star formation history of the universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "numerical simulations play two overlapping but distinct roles in cosmological studies .",
    "first , they provide quantitative predictions that can be compared to observations in order to test the underlying cosmological models .",
    "second , they provide greater understanding of the observational phenomena themselves , by showing how observable structures might arise and evolve in a given cosmological scenario . in this paper",
    "we will emphasize the second of these roles , mainly because the numerical limitations of the simulations and our limited knowledge of the physics of star formation contribute uncertainties that are comparable to the differences between cosmological models .",
    "the examination of different cosmologies is still a useful exercise , however , because it shows how cosmological parameters and properties of primordial mass fluctuations affect the properties of the high - redshift galaxy population when other physical and numerical parameters are held fixed .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations complement the main alternative approach to the theoretical study of high - redshift galaxies , based on semi - analytic models of galaxy formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "semi - analytic models have the advantages of simplicity , flexibility , and speed .",
    "the price is a substantial number of approximations and tunable parameters ; the values of some parameters are fixed by matching selected observations , leaving other observables as predictions of the model .",
    "semi - analytic models incorporate simplified descriptions of gravitational collapse , mergers , and cooling of gas within dark halos .",
    "the strength of numerical simulations is their more realistic treatment of these processes .",
    "the only free parameters ( apart from the physical parameters of the cosmological model being studied ) are those related to the treatment of star formation and feedback . given these parameters ,",

    "* ) with a hierarchical tree algorithm @xcite for computing gravitational forces .",
    "the method and illustrative cosmological applications are described in detail by kwh , so here we just specify the simulation parameters and recap the points that are most important to the present investigation .",
    "each of our simulations uses @xmath17 dark matter and @xmath17 sph particles to model a triply periodic volume @xmath18 comoving mpc on a side , where @xmath19 .",
    "the simulations are evolved to @xmath16 .",
    "for the three critical density ( @xmath13 ) cosmological models , the dark matter particle mass is @xmath20 and the sph particle mass is @xmath21 .",
    "for the two low density ( @xmath22 ) models , the dark matter particle mass is @xmath23 and the sph particle mass is @xmath24 .",
    "gravitational forces are softened using a cubic spline kernel with a softening length @xmath25 , equivalent to @xmath26 for a plummer softening law .",

    "particles have individual time steps that satisfy the conditions @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the peculiar velocity and @xmath30 is the acceleration .",
    "sph particle time steps are also required to satisfy the courant condition ( see kwh ) .",
    "the maximum time step for any particle is @xmath31 .",
    "radiative cooling is computed assuming primordial composition gas with helium abundance @xmath32 by mass .",
    "all of the simulations incorporate a photoionizing uv background with the spectral shape and redshift history computed by @xcite , but with intensity reduced by a factor of two in order to approximately match the mean opacity of the ly@xmath3  forest given our assumed baryon density @xcite . in practice , the photoionizing background has negligible effect on the lyman - break galaxy population , at least in the mass range that our simulations can resolve @xcite .",
    "the gas that resides in collapsed dark matter halos exhibits a two - phase structure : hot gas at roughly the halo virial temperature with a density profile similar to that of the dark matter ( but exhibiting a core at small radii ) , and radiatively cooled gas with @xmath33 at much higher overdensity . in simulations that do not incorporate star formation , the clumps of radiatively cooled gas have masses and sizes comparable to the luminous regions of observed galaxies .",
    "our star formation algorithm is essentially a prescription for turning this dense , cold gas into collisionless stars , returning energy from supernova feedback to the surrounding medium .",
    "we provide a brief synopsis of this algorithm here and refer the reader to kwh for details .",
    "an sph gas particle is `` eligible '' to form stars if it is jeans unstable , resides in a region of converging flow , has an overdensity @xmath34 ( corresponding to the virial boundary of a singular isothermal sphere in the spherical collapse model ) , and has a hydrogen number density exceeding @xmath35 ( physical units ) . in practice , it is the physical density threshold that matters  gas with this density almost always satisfies the other criteria , except at very high redshift , where the overdensity threshold ensures that star formation does not occur in uncollapsed regions simply because the cosmic mean density is high . once a gas particle is _ eligible _ to form stars , its star formation _",
    "rate _ is given by @xmath36 or @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a dimensionless star formation rate parameter , @xmath39 is the fraction of the particle s gas mass that will be converted to stellar mass in a single simulation timestep , and the gas flow timescale @xmath40 is the maximum of the local gas dynamical time , @xmath41 , and the local cooling time .",
    "each sph particle has both a gas mass and a stellar mass ( initially zero ) ; the total gas@xmath42stellar mass contributes to gravitational forces , but only the gas mass is used in computing the sph properties and forces .",
    "the probability @xmath43 that an eligible sph particle undergoes a star formation event in an integration timestep of duration @xmath44 is @xmath45 and if the particle does undergo such an event then @xmath46 of its remaining gas mass is converted into stars during that step . in the limit ( nearly always satisfied in the simulations ) that @xmath47 , this algorithm yields the average star formation rate given by equation  ( [ eqn : sfrate ] ) . ) and  ( [ eqn : lnsfrate ] ) , are missing the factor of @xmath39 . ]",
    "once a particle s gas mass falls below 5% of its original mass , it is converted into a collisionless , pure star particle , affected only by gravity , and its residual gas mass is redistributed to its sph neighbors .",
    "when an sph particle undergoes star formation , recycled gas and supernova feedback energy are distributed to the particle and its neighbors , assuming a miller - scalo ( @xcite ) initial mass function truncated at @xmath48 and @xmath49 and @xmath50 ergs per supernova .",
    "this feedback energy is usually radiated away because it is released into a dense , gas rich medium with a short cooling time .",
    "feedback therefore has only a modest impact in our simulations , and this is the physically appropriate result if the proto - galactic interstellar medium is fairly smooth and as dense as our simulations imply .",
    "it is possible that strong inhomogeneities in the interstellar medium ( on scales well below our resolution limits ) allow feedback to have a stronger effect in real proto - galaxies , and explicit modeling of this possibility is an important direction for future investigation .",
    "the scenario that we investigate here is a physically plausible limiting case .    in all of our simulations we set the star formation rate parameter @xmath38 to 0.1 and @xmath39 to 1/3 .",
    "as shown in kwh , the stellar masses of the simulated galaxies are insensitive to the value of @xmath38 . in the kwh tests ,",
    "an order of magnitude increase to @xmath51 changes the total stellar mass in the box at @xmath16 by only 15% , and the effect of a higher @xmath38 is actually to decrease the stellar mass because star formation occurs in lower density gas where supernova feedback can have a stronger effect .",
    "indeed , one obtains nearly the same galaxy population in simulations that do not include star formation at all , except that in this case the `` galaxies '' are the clumps of cold , dense gas instead of the clumps of cold , dense gas and stars ( see kwh , figure 5 ) . in our simulations , the rate at which a galaxy forms stars is governed mainly by the rate at which gas condenses from the hot halo into the cold clump ; the regulation implied by equation  ( [ eqn : sfrate ] ) ensures that the gas condensation rate and the star formation rate can not get too far out of step . the link between star formation rate and gas density",
    "is physically motivated , since denser gas is more gravitationally unstable and more easily able to radiate its energy . in the case where the cooling timescale is short and @xmath52 ,",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : sfrate ] ) implies @xmath53 , similar to the schmidt - law @xmath54 observed to hold over a large dynamic range in a wide variety of local galaxies @xcite .",
    "we consider five different cosmological models , all of which assume gaussian primordial fluctuations and a universe dominated by cold , collisionless dark matter . in all cases",
    "we adopt a baryon density parameter @xmath55 based on @xcite , though a higher @xmath56 is suggested by recent analyses of the ly@xmath3  forest opacity @xcite and the deuterium abundance in high - redshift lyman limit systems ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the model we refer to as `` standard '' cdm ( scdm ) assumes @xmath13 , @xmath57 , and an rms linear theory fluctuation in @xmath58 spheres of @xmath59 . for this model",
    "we use the parameterization of the cdm power spectrum given by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath59 normalization is roughly consistent with the observed abundance of rich galaxy clusters @xcite , but the scdm model does not reproduce the amplitude of cosmic microwave background anisotropies observed by the cobe - dmr experiment @xcite .",
    "our second model , cobe - normalized cdm ( ccdm ) , is the same as scdm except that the normalization @xmath60 is chosen to match the 4-year cobe data ( @xcite ; see @xcite for a discussion of the cdm normalization ) . with this value of @xmath61 and @xmath13 ,",
    "the ccdm model produces galaxy clusters that are too massive to be consistent with observations .",
    "one way to reconcile the cobe - dmr anisotropies and the observed cluster abundance within the context of @xmath13 cdm models is to assume that inflation generates a primeval power spectrum that is `` tilted '' instead of scale - invariant , @xmath62 with @xmath63 . for our tilted cdm ( tcdm ) model , we adopt @xmath64 and the transfer function given by equation ( d28 ) of @xcite , which treats baryon damping effects more accurately than the original @xcite formulation .",
    "we normalize this analytic fit to the power spectrum to the amplitude @xmath65 implied by cobe normalization , which we compute using the cmbfast code of seljak & zaldarriaga ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , assuming the standard tensor mode contribution to microwave background anisotropies predicted by power law inflation models .",
    "another way to resolve the cobe / cluster conflict is to lower the value of @xmath66 , reducing cluster masses for a given @xmath61 .",
    "we consider two different low-@xmath66 cdm models , one ( lcdm ) with a spatially flat universe and a cosmological constant @xmath67 and one ( ocdm ) with an open universe and @xmath14 .",
    "for lcdm we adopt @xmath22 , @xmath68 , and a primeval spectral index @xmath69 . with the tensor mode contribution",
    ", cmbfast implies a normalization @xmath70 , which provides a good match to the cluster abundances for @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we again use the @xcite formulation of the transfer function . for ocdm , we adopt @xmath22 , @xmath68 , @xmath71 , and a 2-year cobe - dmr normalization @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "cluster masses in this model are lower than those in tcdm or lcdm , but they are consistent with current observations given their uncertainties @xcite . for ocdm",
    "we use the transfer function of @xcite with @xmath73 ; the @xcite formulation is more accurate , but we were unaware of it at the time we ran the ocdm simulation . in practice , the differences between different analytic or numerical formulations of transfer functions are of the same magnitude as the changes caused by slight shifts in the adopted values of @xmath74 , @xmath56 , or @xmath66 .    parameters of the five cosmological models are listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : pk ] shows the linear theory power spectra of the five models , over the range of scales represented in the initial conditions of our simulations . instead of @xmath75 itself , we plot @xmath76 , which ( with our fourier transform convention ) is the contribution to the variance of linear mass fluctuations per unit interval of ln@xmath77 ( see * ?",
    "the differences in fluctuation amplitude among the three @xmath13 models are easy to see , as is the difference in @xmath75 shape between the ccdm / scdm models and the tilted ( tcdm ) and low density ( ocdm / lcdm ) models .",
    "although lcdm has a slightly higher normalization than ocdm at @xmath78 ( @xmath79 vs.  @xmath72 ) , ocdm has higher amplitude fluctuations at @xmath1 because of the smaller ratio of linear growth factors between @xmath1 and @xmath78 in an open universe .",

    "@xcite reach a similar conclusion using analytic arguments . by extrapolating the simulation results with the aid of the press - schechter ( @xcite ) mass function , @xcite",
    "conclude that absorption in lower mass systems is sufficient to account for observed damped ly@xmath3  absorption in any of these cosmological models , with the possible exception of tcdm . however , the uncertainties in the extrapolation are large , and definitive examination of the compatibility between lbg and damped ly@xmath3  constraints will require higher resolution simulations .",
    "semi - analytic methods , sometimes combined with n - body simulations of the dark matter distribution , are the main alternative to hydrodynamic simulations for theoretical investigation of high - redshift galaxy formation . using these methods ,",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the semi - analytic papers have led to three rather different suggestions about the nature of lyman - break galaxies . in the first view , observed lbgs are the most massive galactic systems present at high redshift , forming stars at a fairly steady rate @xcite . in the second view , interactions play a crucial role in triggering bursts of star formation , and many lbgs are low mass systems boosted temporarily , and briefly , to prominence @xcite . a third , intermediate case is one in which lbgs are massive galaxies experiencing bursts of star formation stimulated by minor or major mergers @xcite .",
    "this variety of views is mirrored to some extent in the observational literature on lbgs ( compare , for example , @xcite to @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "our simulations suggest a picture that is intermediate between the extremes of this debate , but closest to the first point of view .",
    "star formation in the simulated galaxies is steady on timescales of 200 myr ( figure  [ fig : sfrcomp ] ) , and the instantaneous star formation rate is fairly well correlated with stellar mass ( figure  [ fig : sfrvsmstar ] ) .",
    "however , there is enough scatter in galaxy star formation rates that a sample of galaxies selected above a sfr threshold includes objects with a substantial range of stellar masses ( figure  [ fig : sfrvsmstar ] ) , and these may reside in halos with a wide range of circular velocities ( figure  [ fig : vc40 ] ) .",
    "the simulations automatically include interactions and mergers , but they do not resolve the existence of the low mass systems envisioned to play an important role in the extreme version of the collision - induced starburst model .",
    "the properties of the simulated lbg population depend on the cosmological initial conditions and on the basic physics of gravity and gas dynamics , but they also depend on our adopted prescription for galactic scale star formation",
    ". the crucial features of this prescription are ( 1 ) that the local star formation timescale decreases with increasing gas density , as implied by studies of local galaxies @xcite , and ( 2 ) that supernova feedback energy is deposited mainly in the dense interstellar medium , where it is usually radiated away before it has a large dynamical impact .",
    "since we do not require any external triggers for star formation , an isolated galaxy that steadily accretes cold gas will convert that gas into stars , albeit over many orbital times .",
    "interactions and mergers can enhance star formation by driving gas to higher density , but galaxies do not build up large reservoirs of dense gas that wait to be ignited .",
    "limited resolution may reduce the influence of interactions and mergers in these simulations , since they do not resolve low mass satellites and do not resolve the nuclear star formation that is prominent in high resolution simulations of starbursts induced by minor ( @xcite ; @xcite ) or major @xcite mergers .",
    "a more efficient feedback mechanism could also lead to more episodic star formation histories , by producing cycles of starbursts followed by suppressed accretion and cooling .",
    "since we have not investigated scenarios in which interactions or feedback play a larger role , we can not draw conclusions about their viability . however , our results suggest that the straightforward treatment of star formation described in  [ sec : numerics ] is sufficient to explain at least the basic properties of the observed lbg population within the cdm cosmological framework .",
    "the clearest prediction of the simulations is that the lyman - break galaxies studied by steidel et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) and @xcite represent the tip of an iceberg .",
    "the cumulative distribution curves in figure  [ fig : cumsfr ] should be taken as lower limits to the predicted galaxy number densities , especially at high redshifts , since limited resolution causes these simulations to underestimate the star formation rates in low mass systems , or to miss the systems entirely . nonetheless",
    ", the curves for , e.g. , the lcdm model show that there should be large numbers of @xmath1 galaxies below the magnitude limits of current lbg samples , and significant numbers of galaxies with sfr@xmath154 even at @xmath7 .",
    "recent searches have already yielded a number of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at @xmath155 @xcite , and analyses of deep hst / nicmos images show candidate objects to redshifts @xmath156 @xcite .",
    "systematic characterization of this faint galaxy population will be challenging , so it will be some time before simulations and data can be compared quantitatively in the very high redshift regime .",
    "but the existence of a significant population of star - forming galaxies at @xmath157 is a natural prediction of the cdm scenario .",
    "figures  [ fig : sfrvsmstar ] and  [ fig : starfrac ] also imply some correlations between observable properties of @xmath1 galaxies . while less massive galaxies tend to have lower star formation rates , they usually have higher ratios of instantaneous sfr to time - averaged sfr , and they should therefore have bluer spectral energy distributions unless they are more heavily reddened by dust .",
    "less massive galaxies also tend to be more gas rich . unfortunately",
    ", both of these predicted trends could be exaggerated by numerical resolution effects , so we do not regard them as very robust .",
    "this paper presents a first attempt to characterize the star formation properties of high - redshift galaxies using hydrodynamic simulations , but there is much room for progress with future simulations .",
    "the emerging consensus on cosmological parameters , if it survives the tightening of observational constraints , makes the task easier by focusing effort on a preferred background model .",
    "within such a framework , simulations with different box sizes and resolutions can be combined to model the galaxy population over a wider dynamic range of mass and redshift , improving the comparison to the observed luminosity function ( as in figure  [ fig : diffsfr ] ) and global star formation history ( as in figure  [ fig : madau ] ) .",
    "@xcite take a first step along this path , using multiple simulations of the lcdm model ( with higher @xmath150 ) to predict cumulative sfr distributions from @xmath158 to @xmath159 . since the present simulations resolve galaxies far below the limits of current lbg spectroscopic samples , simulations of larger volumes at lower resolution",
    "will improve the comparison between predicted and observed lbg clustering .",
    "higher resolution simulations , on the other hand , can probe the connection between lbgs and damped ly@xmath3  systems and test the robustness of some of the trends found in  [ sec : gals ] .",
    "they can also provide predictions of the structural properties of high - redshift galaxies , such as size and morphology , though these may be best investigated with simulations that zoom in to follow the formation of individual objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the long run",
    ", we also hope to examine different formulations of star formation and feedback , to determine what descriptions of these physical processes match the observed properties of galaxies and the intergalactic medium over the full range of accessible redshifts .    where are the lyman - break galaxies today ? because our present simulations stop at @xmath16 , we will save a detailed examination of this question for a future paper on the assembly history of galaxies , using simulations ( like those of @xcite ) that continue to @xmath78 .",
    "a first look at these simulations suggests that there is no simple , one - sentence answer .",
    "between @xmath1 and @xmath78 , galaxies accrete fresh material and merge with each other , and many new galaxies form that had no @xmath1 progenitors at all ( at least above the numerical resolution limits ) .",
    "the particles that lie in galaxies at @xmath1 are distributed at @xmath78 among galaxies with a wide range of environments and masses , though the most massive @xmath78 galaxies always contain some of these particles and the least massive often do not .",
    "any link between lbgs and present - day ellipticals , or bulges , or halos , or clusters , can at best capture a general trend , one that is likely to be violated nearly as often as it is obeyed . fortunately , cosmological simulations are an ideal tool for characterizing the full range of possible histories , providing the theoretical thread that can tie snapshots of the galaxy population at different redshifts into a coherent picture of galaxy formation and evolution .",
