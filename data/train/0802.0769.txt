    "the small-@xmath1 behavior of the proton structure function @xmath7 is striking and has inspired many models and parametrizations . in this paper , fits using different parametrizations of the photon - proton cross section are compared .",
    "the standard hand convention  @xcite is used to define the photon flux , yielding the relation : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the fine structure constant and @xmath10 is the proton mass .",
    "given a parametrization for @xmath11 , we can compare predicted values of @xmath12 to data .",
    "data from e665 , nmc , h1 and zeus have been used for these fits .",
    "the behavior of @xmath0 is studied in the proton rest frame in terms of the coherence length of the photon fluctuations , @xmath6 , and the virtuality , @xmath4 .",
    "the physics picture is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : proton ] , where the electron acts as a source of photons , which in turn acts as a source of quarks , antiquarks and gluons .",
    "the partonic wavefunction of the photon state is dependent on @xmath6 and @xmath4 .",
    "the proton is viewed as a set of interaction centers for the incoming partons .        at small-@xmath1 ,",
    "the coherence length of the photon fluctuations  @xcite in the proton rest frame is a more intuitive variable than bjorken-@xmath1 , and we will use this variable and @xmath4 in our parametrizations . recall the definition of the coherence length ,",
    "@xmath6 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 , the change in energy of the photon as it fluctuates into a system of quarks and gluons , is given by @xmath15 where we have set the mass of the hadronic system into which the photon fluctuated , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the photon energy . this yields @xmath18 note that @xmath10 only appears because of the definition of @xmath1 .",
    "this is the standard expression used in the literature for the coherence length , although other possibilities have also been discussed taking different choices for @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the data used in this analysis are restricted to small @xmath1 values so that @xmath6 is many times larger than the proton radius . for compact photon fluctuations ,",
    "the maximum value of @xmath0 is given by the size of the proton multiplied by @xmath9 , giving roughly @xmath20  @xmath21barn .",
    "however , pqcd calculations have pointed to the property of ` color transparency ' for small dipoles  @xcite , indicating that at large @xmath4 the cross section should behave as @xmath22 .",
    "i.e. , the proton appears almost transparent for small dipoles with the cross section proportional to the size of the photon .",
    "the photon state will have a maximum size which is expected to be set by the mass of the lightest vector meson .",
    "an effective mass will be used as a free parameter in the fits .",
    "all parametrization will therefore have a basic term : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is expected to be a typical hadronic cross section ( multiplied by @xmath9 ) .",
    "the parametrizations will primarily be used to discriminate the @xmath6 dependence of the photon - proton cross section .    in the next sections , we start by reviewing the data sets which have been used for the analysis .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of the parametrizations which have been studied , and a description of the fitting technique employed ( bayesian analysis based on markov chains ) .",
    "the results are then presented and discussed .",
    "the proton dis data used in this analysis were taken from the durham data base , with the exception of the h1 data from the 1999 - 2000 running period which was taken from the h1 collaboration web page .",
    "for the final results , only data with @xmath25 have been used .",
    "data from the fixed target experiments nmc and e665 were used , as well as data from h1 and zeus .",

    "the data in the plots used the bin centering from fit 27 .",
    "the d and 2p parametrizations follow the @xmath6 dependence of the data equally well up to @xmath4 values of about @xmath33  gev@xmath31 . beyond this value , the 2p parametrization is closer to the data .",
    "note that the mean value of @xmath6 for the existing data is decreasing as @xmath4 increases .",
    "it was checked whether the turnover of @xmath2 at higher @xmath4 is due to this by limiting the fitted values to @xmath34 .",

    "a turnover is still seen , although the uncertainties are of course much larger .",
    "one point , at @xmath35  gev@xmath31 , shows a large discrepancy when the data is limited to the range @xmath36 ( fit 26 ) .",
    "the reason is that with this cut , no hera data are available at this @xmath4 . the fitted uncertainty on the value of @xmath2 is small because of the small uncertainties of the fixed target data .",
    "it is difficult to conclude at this point how seriously to take the observed turnover of @xmath2 at the higher @xmath4 values .",
    "while the effect seems to be real , it could still be explained by a combination of limited data and a changing @xmath6 range as @xmath4 changes .",

    "the best fits are from the 2p parametrization ( inspired by the two - pomeron model  @xcite ) .",
    "this conclusion goes hand - in - hand with the observation of a flattening of the effective growth of the cross section at large coherence length , @xmath6 .",
    "this flattening is intruiging , and should be verified with future hera data .",
    "the d parametrization , inspired by the known properties of the hera data , does not allow for this turn - over .",
    "it also gives good fits overall , but clearly does not reproduce the observed @xmath2 values at high @xmath4 .",
    "the buchmller - haidt  @xcite inspired parametrization , bh , does not follow the general trends of the data at the lowest and highest @xmath4 .",
    "a possibly interesting observation is the vanishing of the @xmath4 variation of @xmath0 when extrapolated to particular very large values of @xmath6 .",

    "this behavior indicates that @xmath0 will have a roughly @xmath4 independent value for @xmath5  fm",
    ". an interpretation would be that the photon state has evolved sufficiently after this coherence length that it has lost memory of its initial configuration .",
    "this speculation is based on extreme extrapolations , and more data would of course be needed to check this behavior .",
    "many different parametrizations , not reported in this paper , have been attempted to fit the small-@xmath1 data , including some which gave very good fits .",
    "they look very different in form , so that it is impossible to draw strong physics conclusions from the success of any one fit .",
    "the possible turn - over of @xmath2 at high @xmath4 would provide a distinguishing feature which would rule out many possible forms and hopefully point to the correct physics .",
    "further , higher precision data from heraii is expected on this front and could help clarify the situation .",
