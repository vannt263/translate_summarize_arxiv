    "the non - equilibrium fluctuation relations @xcite yield important results for the distribution of dissipation in experiments where external control parameters are varied non - adiabatically  @xcite .",
    "the validity of these relations rests on appropriate expressions for work and free - energy .",
    "this issue was highlighted in a scholarly manner in @xcite .",
    "the presented general treatment allows one to apply it to a specific system , which in the current case is a single - electron box ( seb ) @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : box](a ) .",
    "single - electron transitions @xcite yield a suitable test - bench of fluctuation relations , where reliable statistics can be collected under stable experimental conditions @xcite . in a seb , a tunnel contact , schematically a split box on the left in fig .",
    "[ fig : box](a ) admits electrons to enter or leave the island in the middle at rates determined by standard tunneling expressions .",
    "the characteristic electrostatic energy of the box can be made large ( small size , low temperature ) such that the number of electrons on it is limited to only two neighbouring values in a given control parameter ( gate ) interval .",
    "our analysis is , however , not restricted to such two - state dynamics .",
    "the quantity @xmath0 introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite is the dissipated energy in the tunneling transitions only , and thus it represents the heat generated . in the present paper",
    "we demonstrate mathematically that the dissipated work , @xmath1 , relevant in fluctuation relations  @xcite , consists of the sum of @xmath0 and the electrostatic energy stored in the circuit during the driven evolution .",
    "we discuss the hamiltonian @xmath2 of the seb , yielding the work @xmath3 in a given protocol of the external drive voltage , and the equilibrium free - energy @xmath4 at a given voltage bias , along the general prescription given in @xcite .",
    "the `` bare '' hamiltonian @xmath5 of the seb is given by the bare electrostatic energy of the capacitors in the circuit , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the capacitance of the tunnel junction , and @xmath8 is that of the gate , see fig .",
    "[ fig : box](a ) ; @xmath9 is the charge at the junction and @xmath10 is that of the gate capacitor .",
    "the generalized force of the seb is the gate voltage @xmath11 , and the generalized coordinate is its charge @xmath10 . with the help of these",
    ", we can express the transformed hamiltonian @xmath2 as @xmath12 we give a proper justification of this basic transformation in section [ sec : lagrange ] .",
    "we next write down @xmath2 as a function of the integer number @xmath13 of electrons on the island and the normalized gate voltage @xmath14 .",
    "the gate charge is given by @xmath15 .",
    "here @xmath16 is the island potential @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the total capacitance of the seb . by elementary analysis",
    "we then have @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the charging energy of the seb .",
    "the work performed in a driven process can be written in general as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the control parameter and the dot refers to the derivative with respect to time @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "thus the work for our system reads @xmath24 where the integral is extended over the gate excursion between the end points",
    ". direct differentiation of eq .",
    "( [ box4 ] ) yields @xmath25 and the proper `` thermodynamic '' work is @xmath26 in full analogy to the result in @xcite .",
    "the `` standard '' expression of work is , on the other hand , the integral of the force along the position , i.e. , @xmath27 as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the two expressions ( [ box6 ] ) and ( [ box5 ] ) are identical for a cyclic trajectory where the perturbation @xmath11 is turned on and then off , as can be verified by elementary partial integration .    with the notations we have used above ,",
    "we find @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the gate positions in the beginning and at the end , respectively .",
    "next we find the change in free energy , again according to the standard procedure @xcite . for completeness",
    ", we allow the system to occupy any integer valued charge state @xmath13 although it is exponentially unlikely for the system to visit a state for which @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the inverse temperature of the bath . for writing down the partition function @xmath33 , we first regroup the hamiltonian as @xmath34 , and then perform the summation over possible @xmath13 states as @xmath35 the remaining infinite summation defines a special function which we will refer to as @xmath36 .",
    "the function is periodic in @xmath37 with a period of 1 , which is a manifestation of the fact that there is no absolute reference point for the charge number @xmath13 .    the change of free energy for the given gate sweep @xmath38 is then @xmath39 the dissipated work , @xmath1 , the central quantity in non - equilibrium fluctuation relations ,",
    "can then be written combining eqs .",
    "( [ box7 ] ) and ( [ box10 ] ) as @xmath40 in the basic gate protocol with @xmath41 , @xmath42 , used in the recent experiment by saira et al .",
    "@xcite , the expression for dissipated work assumes the form @xmath43 the same expression is obtained also if only states @xmath44 and @xmath45 are allowed in the calculation of the partition function .",
    "this is the appropriate choice for , e.g. , experiments in the high charging energy regime @xmath46 .",
    "we give an elementary derivation of eq .",
    "( [ box4 ] ) based on ref .  @xcite . following the general procedure , the gate voltage source in fig .",
    "[ fig : box](a ) is represented by a large capacitance @xmath47 in which is stored intially a large charge @xmath48 such that @xmath49 .",

    "the result is @xmath53 it is important to distinguish between @xmath54 , referring to the variable voltage of node @xmath55 , and @xmath11 , the initial voltage of the source capacitor @xmath47 .",
    "the generalized momenta are obtained with the usual relation @xmath56 , and are equal to the sum of charges at the nodes @xmath52 , @xmath57 the hamiltonian @xmath58 is obtained as @xmath59 to obtain a reduced hamiltonian describing the dynamics of the box charge exactly , one needs to subtract the energy of the capacitor @xmath47 from the full hamiltonian . subtracting the instantaneous energy @xmath60 , one obtains @xmath61 which equals @xmath5 of eq .",
    "( [ box1 ] ) , as it should .",
    "on the other hand , subtracting the energy @xmath62 , which was stored initially in the capacitor should yield the hamiltonian @xmath2 of eq .",
    "( [ box3 ] ) in the limit @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath64 we next analyze the difference @xmath65 .",
    "the charge is conserved on the node @xmath55 .",
    "thus the gate charge at an arbitrary time ( assuming it is zero initially ) reads @xmath66 . inserting this charge conservation into the said difference yields @xmath67 in the limit @xmath63 , we have @xmath68 , yielding @xmath69 in accordance with eq .",

    ") - ( [ box17 ] ) to compare @xmath1 and @xmath0 along gate trajectories @xmath70 with different outcomes .",
    "outcome a , @xmath71 , is the expected ( and in the recent experiments  @xcite the only ) choice , where the system makes the expected transition .",
    "there @xmath72 . in the unlikely outcomes of b , c , and d , the electron numbers in the beginning and at the end are @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , respectively .",

    "we now compare the results ( [ box12 ] ) and ( [ box13 ] ) for different outcomes of the experiment . for convenience ,",
    "we integrate eq .",

    "( [ box14])-([box17 ] ) .",
    "the two quantities , the dissipated work , @xmath1 , and dissipation @xmath0 are directly related .",
    "the difference between them is that @xmath0 gives the pure dissipation in the tunneling events , which is then released as heat typically to the phonon system , whereas @xmath1 is the sum of @xmath0 and the energy stored in the electronic system in the gate ramp . in the properly designed experiment where the transition takes place in all realizations ( @xmath46 ) @xcite , the two quantities are equal .",
