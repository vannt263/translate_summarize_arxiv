    "as the expansion coefficient of ag is about seven times that of si , the ag lattice being pinned at the ag / si interface would expand faster in the surface - normal direction enhancing strain in the ag layer . for the ag / si(111 ) system at 700@xmath9c the strain in the ag layer would be much larger compared to that at rt .",
    "if we assume that this larger strain would be relaxed by introducing dislocations at the interface and a fully relaxed ag layer would form at 700@xmath9c , the fully relaxed ag layer would have _ d_@xmath60 . as the thermal expansion coefficient of ag is much higher than that of si , in cooling the sample down to room temperature",
    ", the ag layer would shrink at a higher rate than si . as the in - plane ag lattice would be pinned at the interface to that of si , which shrinks at a slower rate",
    ", the ag layer would have a larger shrinking in the surface - normal direction leading to a ag(111 ) planar spacing in the surface - normal direction smaller than that of bulk ag .",
    "this is schematically illustrated in fig.11 .",
    "a thick ag layer is likely to undergo this process .",
    "this is also consistent with the narrowness of the ag(111 ) peak corresponding to the shorter _ d_-spacing ( _ d_@xmath61 ) .",
    "the lattice contraction is 0.17% with respect to the bulk @xmath62 spacing .",
    "the weak broader ag(111 ) peak is likely to be due to much thinner islands , which would be able to accommodate the strain due to thermal expansion mismatch without introducing dislocations .",
    "the presence of a thinner island is also seen in fig.9(c ) .",
    "there are actually thin islands with a thickness variation .",
    "the broader peak corresponds to a lattice expansion of 0.21% compared to the bulk @xmath62 spacing . for @xmath18 , the angular separation ( @xmath47 ) between the two ag(111 ) peaks , as seen from fig.10 , is 0.05@xmath9 . for @xmath14",
    "this separation would be @xmath63 and with our laboratory set up it would be more difficult to observe these peaks as separated peaks .",
    "-spacing in the annealed film compared to the corresponding bulk value is schematically illustrated .",
    "see text for details .",
    ", height=173 ]    there are reports that desorption of ag from a ag / si system starts around 550@xmath9c under uhv conditions @xcite .",
    "earlier we studied growth of ag(111 ) layers ( @xmath64 ) on si(111 ) and their annealing behavior under high vacuum ( hv ) condition by rbs / channeling experiments @xcite .",
    "we have studied ag / si annealing ( 30 min ) under high vacuum upto 800@xmath9c . at 600@xmath9c",
    ", we observed very little loss of ag . at 700@xmath9c",
    "there were about 25% loss of ag @xmath0 mainly from grain boundaries without any detectable change of actual film thickness . at 800@xmath9c ( 30 min )",
    "ag films were completly desorbed @xcite . in the present case",
    "we expect that some desorption of ag has taken place in the annealed film .",
    "we have studied growth of ag on si(111)-@xmath19 surfaces at room temperature",
    ". initial deposition of @xmath2 1 ml ag produces islands with a strongly preferred height of two atomic layers of ag on the wetting layer .",
    "thicker films show a tendency of growth of n - layer islands , where n is even .",
    "this appears to be a consequence of electron confinement in the metallic film .",
    "as - deposited thicker films ( @xmath5720 ml ) show the formation of hexagonal islands at the top .",
    "these multi - tier islands have monatomic step edges .",
    "annealed films show the formation of hexagonal disc - like islands .",
    "individual islands show double - layer height at the edges , while multi - tier islands show monatomic height edges as in the as - deposited films . while the as - deposited films are epitaxial with a mosaic spread , the epitaxy improves up on annealing .",
    "an annealed 40 ml film has been found to show two closely - spaced ag(111 ) peaks .",
    "the strong peak corresponding to shorter _ d_-spacing compared to the bulk value can be explained by the perependicular contraction up on cooling of the ag lattice , which is presumably relaxed at high temperature during annealing , as a consequence of thermal expansion mismatch between ag and si .    within our limited search",
    "we have not observed , for rt growth , any thickness window for the uniform layer growth @xmath0 a prediction from the electronic growth mechanism .",
    "obviously an extended search over film thickness and growth temperature would be necessary to explore this aspect .    the fact that bilayer growth is prefered even at the outer layers of relatively thick films",
    "needs further theoretical attention .",
    "ag growth on si(111)-(7@xmath17 ) at rt can not be simply classified within the three commonly known growth modes .",
    "the elctronic confinement apparently plays a role in determining the film morphology . to what thickness electron confinement effect",
    "is operative is also an important aspect to be investigated .",
