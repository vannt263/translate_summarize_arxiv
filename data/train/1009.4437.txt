    "the phenomenon of superconductivity appearing in compounds having magnetic elements , has received noticeable attention during the last three decades due to the great variety of exotic electronic and magnetic correlations it involves .",
    "particularly interesting for this topic , has been the discovery of the quaternary intermetallic compounds ; _ _ r__ni@xmath1b@xmath1c , ( _ r _ = rare earths , y , sc , th ) @xcite where coexistence of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity has been observed as for example in _ r _",
    "= ( tm , er , ho , dy , lu ) @xcite .",
    "as far as we know several _ _",
    "r__t@xmath1b@xmath1c intermetallics compounds , with different rare earths ( _ r _ ) and transition metal ( t ) combinations , have been synthesized cava2,muller , cava3,carter , sampath , massalami , gupta2006,anand2007,massalami2009 and most of them , such as honi@xmath1b@xmath1c @xcite , show superconductivity in spite of the presence of the rare earth magnetic element .",
    "the influence of the transition metal magnetism in the magnetic properties of these compounds , seem to be of minor importance compared to that of the rare earth ions , whose magnetic moments apparently impose the magnetic ordering at all . thus in some borocarbides with 3__d _ _ transition elements such as ni and co , neutron - diffraction measurements @xcite , and electronic transport measurements @xcite , have revealed that no significant magnetic moment develops in the t sites .",
    "local structure studies at the ni site , using mossbauer spectroscopy on @xmath6fe doped ( 1 at % ) samples , also support this fact @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the t elements play an indirect role in the magnetism of magnetic _ _ r__t@xmath1b@xmath1c systems through the spatial dependent indirect rkky exchange interactions @xcite , that govern the magnetic ordering in these compounds . on the other hand ,",
    "the electronic influence of the t elements in the superconductivity of _ _ r__t@xmath1b@xmath3c is more relevant than that for the _ r _ , b and c elements .",
    "this is particularly true for the ni based borocarbide superconductors , where the density of state at the fermi level is mainly due to the ni _",
    "3d _ bands @xcite . on the contrary , in a comparative study of the structure and superconducting properties of _ _",
    "r__ni@xmath1b@xmath1c , loureiro _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , showed that the superconducting state is more strongly affected by the magnetism of the _ r _ ion than for the _ r_-ion size , at least for _ r _ between dy and tm .",
    "however , the role of the magnetism and ion - size of t elements in the superconductivity of _ _ r__t@xmath1b@xmath1c when magnetic _ r _ ions are presents , is not clear yet . in this work",
    "we aboard the study of a particularly interesting case : the prt@xmath1b@xmath1c compounds , with t = ni , co , and pt which have revealed many peculiarities .",
    "prni@xmath1b@xmath1c , and prco@xmath1b@xmath1c do not superconduct as measured down to 0.3 k narozhnyi , however , prpt@xmath1b@xmath1c does superconduct at 6 k , even in the magnetic pr@xmath7 ion presence @xcite . noticeably , prpt@xmath1b@xmath1c does not show any magnetic ordering at low temperatures @xcite but in contrast , pr - ni and pr - co based borocarbides , develop antiferromagnetic ordering at about 4 and 8.5 k , respectively duran1prb , duran2prb .",
    "recently , magnetoresistance and specific heat studies in pr(co , pt)@xmath1b@xmath1c @xcite have pointed out that spin fluctuation mechanism is involved in the electronic behavior of these two compounds . however , although evidence for spin fluctuations can be deduced from certain features in the electronic transport measurements , the interpretation of those properties could be not so clear .",
    "high pressure experiments in spin fluctuators such as rco@xmath1 @xcite , ceni@xmath8 @xcite , and upt@xmath9 brodaleupt3pressure have proven to be a useful tool in order to make clear if a spin fluctuation mechanism is occurring in such systems .",
    "the aim of this paper is to enlighten the influence of the chemical and external applied pressure on the superconducting state and magnetic scattering at low temperature for the three pr - based borocarbides : pr(ni , co , pt)@xmath1b@xmath1c .",
    "we analyzed the changes of the resistivity as a function of pressure and temperature .",
    "we assume that interactions between itinerant electrons plays an important role in the low temperature resistivity characteristic , and those can be modified by applied external or internal chemical pressure .",
    "three compounds were prepared : samples of prco@xmath1b@xmath1c , prni@xmath1b@xmath3c , and prpt@xmath1b@xmath1c .",
    "the single crystals were grown by cold copper crucible method as described by durn _",
    "et al _ duran2prb .",
    "all samples were characterized by x - ray diffraction using a bruker p4 diffractometer , with monochromatized mo - k@xmath10 radiation .",
    "the cell parameters were : _ a _",
    "@xmath11  , and _",
    "c _ @xmath12   for prco@xmath1b@xmath1c ,  _ a _",
    "@xmath13  , and _",
    "c _ @xmath14   for prni@xmath1b@xmath1c , and _ a _ @xmath15  , _ c _ @xmath16",
    "  for prpt@xmath1b@xmath1c samples . resistivity measurements in the _ a - b _ plane were performed by the four - probe technique using gold wires of @xmath17 @xmath18 diameter as electrical contacts .",
    "pressure experiments were performed by using a micro - cryogenic diamond anvil cell mcdac ( cell piston - cylinder type be - cu cell ) consisting of two diamonds , each of @xmath19 @xmath20 culet size .",
    "a cu - be gasket was preindented and a @xmath21 @xmath18 diameter hole was drilled at the center .",
    "the samples used have dimensions of about @xmath22 @xmath23 and were placed in the gasket hole .",
    "the transmitting pressure medium was mgo powder .",
    "the metallic gasket was electrically insulated , pressing over it al@xmath1o@xmath9 powder of @xmath24 @xmath18 grain size . as the mcdac pressure increases",
    ", the wires used to measure the electrical resistance may be cut off at the edge of the diamonds because of the diamond indentation . to reduce this problem , we used a thin aluminum foil placed under the four gold wires , with this set up frequently we reached high quasi - hydrostatic pressures in the range about 6 gpa .",
    "also , in order to prevent motion of the sample and of the electrical leads , at the initial compressing , a thin mylar film was placed over them .",
    "additional pressure experiments in polycrystalline pr(ni , pt)@xmath1b@xmath1c compounds up to about 21 gpa were made using a sintered diamond bridgman anvil apparatus , with a pyrophyllite gasket and two steatite disks as the pressure medium . for determination of the pressures",
    "a pb manometer were used .",
    "it is known that the _ _ r__ni@xmath1b@xmath1c compounds crystallize in the tetragonal body - centered structure ( space group _",
    "i4_/mmm ) and when the rare earth atom radii is increased ( _ r _ goes from la to lu ) , the _ c_-parameter becomes larger whereas the _ a_-parameter decreases @xcite .",
    "this structural behavior can be accounted by for the rigidity of the b - c and ni - b bonds and the variable tetrahedral angle in the nib@xmath25 unit .",
    "distortions of this tetrahedral unit are claimed to be a decisive parameter for tc in non magnetic or antiferromagnetic _",
    "_ r__ni@xmath1b@xmath1c and _ _ r__nibc compounds @xcite . in the case when the size of the transition element is increased , maintaining the same rare earth element , the structural behavior of the unit cell seems to be slightly different .",
    "1 displays the t - t shortest length between 3__d _ _ ions , particularly in the pr(ni , co , pt)@xmath1b@xmath1c compounds and that for the metal t. also it shows the behavior of the _ a _ and _ c _ parameters for each compound .",
    "we note that increasing the ionic radii t - size causes an increasing of the _ c_-parameter and an anomaly behavior of the _ a_-parameter for the prco@xmath1b@xmath1c compound . at first glance and",
    "according to the figure , this anomaly is correlated with the variation of the t - t shortest bond in the framework of the prt@xmath1b@xmath1c structure , and not with the ionic radii size of the t element .",
    "2 shows the normalized electrical resistivity in the _ a - b _ plane as a function of temperature for prni@xmath1b@xmath1c , prco@xmath1b@xmath1c , and prpt@xmath1b@xmath1c single crystals at room pressure .",
    "the three compounds present metallic characteristic . at",
    "low temperature ni and co based compounds show notable similarities , but are not superconductors , whereas prpt@xmath1b@xmath1c has a sharp superconducting temperature at about 6 k. the residual resistivity ratios rrr for the first two compounds are @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively , whereas for prpt@xmath1b@xmath1c is @xmath28 .",
    "the residual resistivity  @xmath29 of all three is sample dependent , varying between 5 and 25 @xmath30 the main panel of fig .",
    "2 shows some interesting characteristics : ni and co based compounds present a notable positive curvature from about 150 to 50 k , whereas pt compound presents a wide bump from about 250 to 20 k. these notable differences may signal a clearly distinctive influence of the crystalline field at high temperatures .",
    "a gradual but pronounced drop in resistivity comes to disturb the linear variation to about 8 and 20 k for prni@xmath1b@xmath1c , and prco@xmath1b@xmath1c , respectively .",
    "such resistivity behavior at relatively low temperature is typical for magnetic elements of the _ _",
    "r__ni@xmath1b@xmath1c series , and it has been associated with a decrease of the magnetic scattering of the conduction electrons by rare earth ions ( @xcite and reference therein ) . however , according to the results present below , it is possible that other mechanism involving conduction electrons could also develop at low temperature . the case for prpt@xmath1b@xmath1c is quite different , after following an upward curvature it becomes superconducting at about 6 k. magnetic and heat capacity measurements in this compound @xcite , have revealed a nonmagnetic ground state for pr ions due to cef effects , which is claimed to be the reason for superconductivity .",
    "the inset of the fig .",
    "2 shows the resistivity behavior from 60 to 2 k for the three compounds at room pressure . at first glance ,",
    "increasing the transition metal radiuscorresponds to a major resistivity droop at low temperature .",
    "the @xmath2 curve for prco@xmath1b@xmath1c from about 2 to 8 k shows a clear t@xmath31-law dependence with a cuadratic coefficient a , equal to 0.08 @xmath32cm / k@xmath31 , see fig .",
    "3 . this low - temperature resistivity behavior is similar to the observed in heavy fermion systems , as for example ; ybni@xmath1b@xmath1c and upt@xmath9 compounds @xcite , and could be attributed to spin fluctuations @xcite .",
    "thus , in a similar compound but simpler , rco@xmath1 , a t@xmath31 dependence has been found at low temperatures , which is due to spin fluctuating characteristics @xcite .",
    "the fact that the magnitude of the cuadratic coefficient _ a _ of @xmath33 for prco@xmath1b@xmath1c is of the order of that for rco@xmath1 ( @xcite , found this coefficient as big as three orders of magnitude but in polycrystalline prco@xmath1b@xmath1c ) suggests that spin fluctuating could be the responsible mechanism for the low temperature @xmath33 behavior in this compound .",
    "using the universal relation for heavy fermion compounds ; @xmath34 @xmath35k@xmath36  @xcite the resulted sommerfeld coefficient is @xmath37  @xmath38k@xmath31 which is a low value compared with that for prni@xmath1b@xmath1c ( @xmath39k@xmath40 duran2prb by specific heat measurements ) , but enhanced value as compared to the normal metal co and to other borocarbides as yco@xmath1b@xmath1c massalami , ( gd , tb , dy , ho , er , tm)ni@xmath1b@xmath1c @xcite , whose @xmath41 is about @xmath42  @xmath38k@xmath31 .",
    "4 and 5 shown the @xmath2  curves as a function of pressure for prni@xmath1b@xmath1c and prco@xmath1b@xmath1c single crystals , respectively .",
    "as we can see , these compounds reveal different pressure behaviors .",
    "the overall trend of @xmath2 for the pr - ni based compound does not change as the pressure increases up to 5.3 gpa .",
    "the linear behavior of @xmath43 ( extending from about 100 k to room temperature ) is attributed to electron - phonon scattering and under the applied pressures , it shows a slope decreasing from 0.089 @xmath44cm / k to 0.069 @xmath44cm / k . according to the inset of fig .",
    "4 , the smooth drop of @xmath2 at low temperature , which has been related to the decrease of magnetic scattering @xcite , is reduced with applied pressures increasing up to 5.3 gpa . in the case of prco@xmath1b@xmath1c , as can be seen in panel * b * of fig",
    ". 5 , the pressure effects are more stronger than in prni@xmath1b@xmath1c , mainly in the low temperature regime . from room pressure to about 1.7 gpa the high temperature behavior of @xmath45 from 300 k to about 75 k , remains without appreciable changes and with almost a constant slope of 0.30 @xmath44cm / k . in an opposite way to prni@xmath1b@xmath1c , the low temperature curvature of @xmath2 , which is also associated with magnetic correlations , tends strongly to be suppressed by pressure .",
    "this tendency has also been observed by massalami _ et .",
    "massalammijmmm2004 applying pressures up to about 1.2 gpa , the maximum pressure value they applied .",
    "similar to their results , we also observed that the cuadratic behavior of @xmath2 at low temperatures is maintained under 1.2 gpa .",
    "however , we found , applying pressures higher than 1.7 gpa on this compound , a distinctive characteristic , namely the change of the low temperature curvature from concave to convex and the complete disappearance of the resistivity drop above 2.9 gpa ( see panel * b * in fig.5 ) .",
    "interestingly , at this pressure the _ _ t__@xmath31 behavior disappeared and instead there is an appearing of a type plateau zone in @xmath2 which start about 15 k and extend down to 1.8 k , the lowest temperature available in our experiments . increasing the pressure up to 4.4 gpa , this zone of constant resistivity",
    "is extended from 1.8 k up to 20 k. at this pressure , the overall high temperature behavior of @xmath2 remains almost with the same slope of about 0.30 @xmath44cm / k .",
    "the above experimental facts reveal that the electronic properties of prco@xmath3b@xmath1c are more pressure sensitive than that for prni@xmath1b@xmath1c , mainly at the low temperature regime .",
    "interestingly , we note that the shape of @xmath2 for prco@xmath1b@xmath1c under pressure tends to be qualitatively similar to that for nonmagnetic yco@xmath1b@xmath1c at room pressure @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems the effect of pressure in this compound is to suppress the magnetic correlations which originate the low temperature scattering behavior .",
    "according to fig 5 , the resistivity can be fitted to a @xmath46 behavior only for a region of relatively low temperatures , interestingly under pressure the fitting range is extended .",
    "as already we pointed out , at atmospheric pressure the fitting goes from 2 up to about 8 k with a cuadratic coefficient _ a _ , equal to 0.08 @xmath44cm / k@xmath31 . at 1.7 gpa",
    "the interval extends from 2 to about 19.5 k , with a value of _ a _ decreased to 0.018 @xmath44cm / k@xmath31 . once the applied pressure reaches the value of 2.9 gpa , it was not more possible to fit a cuadratic function to the curvature of @xmath2 because the like plateau zone , also presented for the curves at 3.7 and 4.4 gpa .",
    "this @xmath2 behavior at low temperature and pressures is accounted by the spin fluctuation scenario @xcite , which also take in account the decreasing of the _ a _ parameter with the applied pressure .",
    "additionally , relatively low magnetic fields decreases the _ a _ parameter in a linear form in prco@xmath1b@xmath1c @xcite , which has been claimed to be due to quenching of the spin fluctuation .",
    "similar results have been found in other systems as for example , ce@xmath47(pr , nd)ni@xmath8 , indicating that spin fluctuations tends to be suppressed both by pressure and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the microscopic character of the state resulting from applying a magnetic field is completely different from that obtained with applying pressure ; the first remains magnetic , whereas the last tends to be a real non - magnetic state ; one where no microscopic magnetic moments exists .",
    "this is important because in the spin fluctuations model the state above @xmath48 ( where the spin fluctuation appears and which coincide with the temperature below which a @xmath46 law in resistivity is valid ) is non the non magnetic state ( like in the stoner model ) but a magnetic state , where local moments still exist , but long range order tend to be destroyed by the fluctuations .",
    "the collective modes described by the spin fluctuations can readily be excited at relatively low temperature , where the stoner excitations are still very small but we assume they can be suppressed by two factors : intense magnetic field and/or external applied pressure .",
    "pressure increases the correlation there exist between _ f _ ions and promotes the itinerance of _ f _ electrons . as a result",
    "the _ f_-density of state near the fermi level is lowered modifying the electron structure and influencing thus the prevailing long range order between the band electrons .    in order to know",
    "if the @xmath33 of prni@xmath1b@xmath1c could follow a similar behavior to that for its isomorphs prco@xmath1b@xmath1c at higher pressures , we carried out measurements for polycrystalline sample at several pressures up to 21.5 gpa .",
    "interestingly , we found there is a marked tendency of @xmath33 at low temperature to behave similar to that for prco@xmath1b@xmath3c ( see fig .",
    "6 ) . at about 13.5 gpa",
    "there is a change from negative to positive curvature of @xmath33  at temperatures lower than about 15 k. this curvature change was also found in pr - co system but at about 1.7 gpa .",
    "it is important to mention that from the @xmath49 curves for prni@xmath1b@xmath1c ( see inset of fig .",
    "6 ) , and prco@xmath1b@xmath1c ( not shown ) , we discarded some structural phase changes that could be related to these effects . the fact that pr - ni system requires more pressure to behaves almost in the same way to pr - co system at low temperature , could be related to changes in the _",
    "c- _ parameter .",
    "the main difference in the unit cell of these two compounds stands from this parameter , which is biggest in pr - co system and related to the modifiable tetrahedral b - t - b angle . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that for the spin fluctuator ymn@xmath1 , the existence of a magnetic moment on mn sites depends largely on the interatomic mn - mn distance @xcite . above a critical distance",
    "there exists a magnetic moment .",
    "such distance plays a key - role in determining the magnetic properties and is sensitive to external or internal perturbations . the case for pt in prpt@xmath1b@xmath1c",
    "could be similar .",
    "as we already point out this compound shows an upward curvature in @xmath33  at high temperature which has been related to crystalline electric field ( cef ) effects @xcite .",
    "we make resistivity measurements for polycrystalline prpt@xmath1b@xmath1c under several pressures up to 21.5gpa ( see fig .",
    "as it can be observed , the negative curvature of @xmath33at high temperature is not appreciably modified under pressure and the main changes are at low temperatures .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature , t@xmath50 , decreases at the rate dt@xmath50/dp = -0.34  k/ gpa ( see fig .",
    "it seems there is not correlation with the decreasing of t@xmath50 and the unmodified curvature related to cef effects .",
    "a positive magnetoresistance at low temperature in this compound has been associated with spin fluctuation duran2prb , however although this picture follows the same trends of pr(ni , co)@xmath1b@xmath1c , further investigations are inquired in order to clarify this matter .",
    "high pressure resistivity measurements in pr(co , ni , pt)@xmath1b@xmath1c has been made .",
    "the first and foremost fact we found is that applied pressures of about 4.0 gpa are able to change drastically the low temperature resistivity behavior of prco@xmath1b@xmath1c , but it requires @xmath51 13.0 gpa in order to attain similar changes for prni@xmath1b@xmath1c .",
    "this means that the low temperature electronic transport properties of prco@xmath1b@xmath1c are more pressure sensitive than that for the isomorphous prni@xmath1b@xmath1c .",
    "evidence for spin fluctuation in prco@xmath1b@xmath1c is reported from the cuadratic behavior of its resistivity at low temperature , and from the decreasing of the cuadratic coefficient as a function of pressure . for  prco@xmath3b@xmath1c , the magnetic scattering related to spin disorder",
    "is suppressed at 2.9 gpa , but it remained observable at less under 5.3 gpa for prni@xmath1b@xmath1c . for the case of the superconductor prpt@xmath1b@xmath1c , pressure does not modify the @xmath33 curvature related to cef effects , but decreases tc at the rate dtc / dp = -0.34 k / gpa . finally ,",
    "although these conclusions are no decisive , we believe they would stimulate further experimental and theoretical studies for a better understanding of the pressure effects in the _ _ r__t@xmath1b@xmath1c compounds , which is far for complete .",
