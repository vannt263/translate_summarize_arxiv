    "the flux of the diffuse photon background radiation , its spectrum and its evolution with time are very interesting topics of astrophysics . in nearly all energy regions",
    "both an extragalactic and a galactic component of the diffuse radiation can be identified .",
    "the former component , which is essentially isotropic , gives information about processes and developments at large distances from our galaxy , ranging partly back to the early universe .",
    "details about our own galaxy like the interstellar matter , radiation and magnetic fields as well as about the origin and the propagation of galactic cosmic rays can be deduced from investigations of the galactic diffuse emission .",
    "direct measurements of the diffuse emission in the 30 mev to 50 gev energy range are provided by the egret experiment @xcite . at high galactic latitudes",
    "an extragalactic component has been observed , a significant fraction of which is attributed to the direct emission from agns @xcite .",
    "the main part of the diffuse emission is concentrated at the galactic disc and the inner galaxy , which therefore points to a galactic origin .",
    "the egret data below 1 gev can be well explained by interactions of cosmic - ray electrons and protons with the interstellar radiation field and with the interstellar matter @xcite .",
    "the dominant interaction processes are @xmath10 production by nucleon - nucleon interactions , inverse compton ( ic ) scattering with low - energy photons and high - energy electron bremsstrahlung . above 1 gev",
    "the observed photon flux exceeds the model predictions @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the average interstellar proton spectrum is harder than the spectrum observed in the local neighbourhood , leading to a harder @xmath10 and thus also to a harder diffuse gamma - ray spectrum @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy may also be due to an underestimation of the inverse - compton contribution , which starts to become relevant above 1 gev @xcite .",
    "the favoured hypothesis for an enhanced ic contribution is an average electron spectrum in the galaxy which is substantially harder than that measured locally @xcite .",
    "an alternative or additional contribution could be gamma - radiation from supernova remnants and pulsars @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that in models with increased inverse - compton contribution @xcite not only the excess of photons above 1 gev can be explained but also the longitude and latitude profiles up to the galactic poles can be reproduced .",
    "this could be relevant for the experimental determinations of the isotropic extragalactic emission .    in these models",
    "the ic contribution to the diffuse photon background dominates above 1 gev . depending on the cutoff energy for the electron injection spectrum a maximum of the differential photon flux ( multiplied by @xmath11 )",
    "is predicted between 30 tev and 200 tev @xcite . for the inner galaxy the flux at the maximum corresponds to a fraction of @xmath12 of the cosmic ray flux ( see fig . [ fig15 ] ) .",
    "the ic contribution is rather broad in galactic latitude and extends up to the galactic poles , and even there it is comparable to or greater than the expected isotropic extragalactic contribution @xcite .",
    "the broad distribution in galactic latitude is due to the broad distribution of the interstellar radiation field , which is the target field for the ic process .",
    "in contrast , a model with enhanced @xmath10 production would predict a gamma radiation which is more confined to the galactic disc , because of the narrow distribution of the interstellar matter , the target for the @xmath10 production process .",
    "this difference may allow one to distinguish between the two hypotheses .",
    "contributions to the extragalactic diffuse emission below 100 tev are expected from the cascading of ultra - high - energy photons and electrons on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , creating eventually a pile - up of gamma - rays in the 10 - 100 tev region @xcite .",
    "the ultra - high - energy photons and electrons may be decay products of supermassive particles @xcite , themselves radiated during collapse or annihilation of topological defects @xcite .",
    "alternatively they may result from the interaction of ultra - high - energy hadronic cosmic rays with the cmb @xcite",
    ". the expected level of gamma flux contributed by the cascading process is estimated to be 10@xmath13 of the cosmic ray flux @xcite .    in the 1 tev to 1 pev energy range",
    "there are two experiments which claim the observation of a diffuse photon signal : @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the result reported by @xcite is only a 2.8 sigma effect and may therefore well be considered as an upper limit .",
    "moreover , there may be an additional uncertainty of the result due to uncertainties on the muon content of photon showers @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray excess reported by @xcite is a 3.8 sigma effect , which may be correlated with the loop 1 region . in a later publication by the same collaboration @xcite only an upper limit of the diffuse gamma - ray flux",
    "all other experiments in the 1 tev to 1 pev energy region give upper limits on the diffuse photon flux ( see tables [ table2 ] and [ table5 ] and figs .",
    "[ fig15 ] and [ fig16 ] ) .    in the present analysis @xcite an independent new determination of an upper limit on the diffuse photon background",
    "is performed in the 20 tev - 100 tev region , where only two other experiments have reported results @xcite , in addition to previous measurements with the hegra array @xcite .",
    "the energy region below and around 100 tev is of particular interest because on the one hand the extragalactic component of the diffuse photon background is expected to contribute predominantly in this energy region . on the other hand , according to some models @xcite , the ratio @xmath14 of the differential diffuse photon flux @xmath1 of galactic origin to the cosmic ray flux @xmath2 has a maximum in the 100 tev region ( see figs .",
    "[ fig15 ] and [ fig16 ] ) .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : section 2 describes the experimental details , section 3 the monte carlo simulation . in section 4 the definition of the data sample to be used in the analysis",
    "the measurement of the upper limit on the diffuse photon flux is presented in section 5 and the results are discussed in section 6 .",
    "the data were taken with the hegra air shower array located at 2200 m a.s.l . on the canary island la palma . since april 1998 the array consisted of 97 wide - angle cherenkov detectors ( airobicc ) and of 182 scintillation detectors .",
    "a fire in october 1997 had destroyed 39 airobicc detectors , all of which were rebuilt , and 65 scintillation detectors , of which only 4 were rebuilt .",
    "the two types of detectors measure the cherenkov radiation and the secondary particles ( mainly photons , converted in a 5 mm thick lead plate above the @xmath15 thick plastic scintillator sheet , and electrons ) respectively , which are produced in air showers induced by primary cosmic rays ( including gammas ) in the atmosphere .",
    "the airobicc detectors were distributed over an area of @xmath16 m .",
    "this area contained completely the @xmath17 m area covered by the scintillator array .",
    "the detectors are described in detail in @xcite    the experimental trigger required a time coincidence within 150 ns of @xmath18 6 cherenkov detectors ( airobicc trigger ) or of @xmath18 14 scintillation detectors ( scintillator trigger ) .",
    "the trigger rate was 28 hz on the average .",
    "the data used in this analysis were taken in the period from april 1998 to march 2000 .",
    "only data with an airobicc trigger have been considered .",
    "the total effective observation time amounts to @xmath19 hours .",
    "the detectors register the arrival time ( _ time _ data ) and the light flux ( _ amplitude _ data ) hitting the photocathode of the photomultipliers . for each detector",
    "the amplitude is given in terms of the number of adc channels .",
    "in the case of the scintillator array the relative calibration of amplitudes between the individual detectors is done on the basis of the so - called 1-mip peak. the 1-mip peak is the position of the maximum in the adc spectrum corresponding to the detector response for 1 minimum ionizing particle @xcite . for the cherenkov array a relative calibration between the individual detectors is achieved by normalizing the high - amplitude tails of the individual adc spectra to each other @xcite .",
    "the absolute calibrations of the amplitudes are described in section 3.2 .    by the absolute calibrations",
    "the amplitudes are transformed into a density of cherenkov photons impinging on the surface of the cherenkov detectors or a density of secondary electrons and photons impinging on the surface of the scintillation detectors respectively .    for each shower the shower direction ,",
    "the position of the shower core and the cherenkov light density @xmath20 as a function of the distance @xmath21 from the shower core were reconstructed by a simultaneous fit @xmath22 to the @xmath23 and @xmath24 data from the cherenkov detectors . from @xmath20 the cherenkov light density @xmath25 at @xmath26 m and the light radius @xmath27 in the region 50 m @xmath28",
    "120 m were derived .",
    "the total number @xmath29 of photons and electrons at the detector level was determined by a maximum likelihood fit to the particle densities from the scintillation detectors .",
    "@xmath25 is known to be a good measure of the shower energy . in the following @xmath25 and @xmath30",
    "are assumed to be given in units of and [ m ] respectively .",
    "the quality of the various fits to the @xmath23 and @xmath24 data , expressed in terms of @xmath31probabilities and in terms of errors of fitted parameters , is used below in the definition of the selection criteria for the showers .",
    "an essential part of the present analysis is the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of the experiment .",
    "the simulation comprises :    * the simulation of the physical processes in the shower development , including the production of cherenkov photons .",
    "the corsika program , version 4.068 , was used for this step @xcite . * the simulation of the detector .",
    "a comprehensive discription is given in @xcite .",
    "* the simulation of the chemical composition and of the energy spectrum of the charged cosmic rays . the simulation was based on the compilation @xcite ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "mc data were generated for primary photons , protons , he- , o- and fe nuclei , for the zenith angles @xmath32 = 10@xmath33 , 20@xmath33 and 30@xmath33 and for the energy region 5  tev @xmath34  tev . for each particle type and each zenith angle approximately the same number of showers was generated , giving a total of 133 000 showers . by assigning to each of these showers 20 different core positions , chosen randomly in a @xmath35 m area centered at the actual detector array ,",
    "the statistics of quasi - independent showers was increased by a factor of 20 .",
    "the generated showers were given appropriate weights to simulate the expected distributions in e , @xmath32 and the cosmic ray species .",
    "for the comparisons with the experimental data an admixture of photons with @xmath36 has been assumed in the mc sample ( see table [ table1 ] ) , corresponding to 1/1000 of the hadronic cosmic ray flux at 1 tev .    in the following mc events",
    "always means weighted mc events.      the absolute calibration of @xmath29 and @xmath25 is done separately for each subrun ( corresponding to 30 minutes of observation time ) .",
    "the calibration factor for @xmath29 is determined such that in the experimental data agrees with in the mc data .",
    "this is done using samples defined by the standard selection criteria ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the absolute @xmath29 calibration defines - through the mc simulation - the absolute energy scale in the experimental data . by comparing with other methods of calibrating @xmath29 , for example using the 1-mip peak",
    "not only for the relative but also for the absolute calibration of @xmath29 @xcite , the error in the absolute energy scale is estimated to be in the order 20% .",
    "after calibration , the @xmath37 distributions of the experimental data and of the mc data agree fairly well ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "there is also reasonable agreement in the total number of showers : for a small subset of runs the total number of showers in the experimental data was compared with the corresponding mc number expected on the basis of the measured on - time and the all - particle cosmic ray flux from @xcite .",
    "there is agreement within 7% .",
    "this can be regarded as a good consistency between experimental data and mc data , given the fact that already a miscalibration of @xmath29 by 10% would yield a discrepancy in the number of reconstructed showers of ( @xmath38 ) = 17.6% .",
    "the absolute calibration of @xmath25 is done using the calibrated @xmath29 values , namely by determining a calibration factor for @xmath25 such that @xmath39 in the experimental data coincides with @xmath39 in the mc data .",
    "the calibration factor is determined separately for each of five bins in the variable @xmath40 .",
    "a comparison of the fluctuations of arrival times and amplitudes between experimental data and mc data gave good agreement for the data from the scintillation detectors .",
    "for the cherenkov detectors the fluctuations were found to be significantly lower in the mc data than in the experimental data .",
    "the difference is explained on the one hand by an underestimation of the average light of the night sky background in the mc simulation . on the other hand",
    ", the difference may be due to subtle effects in the conversion chain from the photons to the final electronic signal , such as variations in the winston cone reflectivity , non - uniformity in the quantum efficiency and the photoelectron collection efficiency of the photomultiplyers , etc . .",
    "instead of repeating the mc simulation with a more realistic night sky background and with a refined simulation of the detector non - uniformities , the fluctuations of arrival times and amplitudes from the cherenkov detectors were randomly increased in the mc - generated data to agree with those in the experimental data . on the average the rms of the cherenkov photon densities and that of the cherenkov photon arrival times was increased by a factor of 1.8 .",
    "some comparison of experimental data and mc data are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] to [ fig8 ] .",
    "the data samples are defined by the standard selection criteria listed in section 4 . because these selection criteria are tighter than the trigger condition no simulation of the trigger was necessary . in each of the figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] to [ fig3 ] the two distributions were normalized to the same total number of events . for @xmath37 , @xmath30 and also for @xmath41 versus @xmath42 the agreement between data and mc is quite good .",
    "a large discrepancy is found for @xmath43 at @xmath44 .",
    "this may be due to the time dependence of the light of the night sky in the experimental data which was not taken into account in the mc simulation .",
    "an experimental upper limit of the flux of diffuse photons will obviously be the tighter the better photons can be discriminated from hadrons .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile searching for measurable quantities which allow a photon - hadron discrimination at least to a certain degree . in the present analysis",
    "this is done exclusively with mc data : as no prominent photon signal has been found so far with hegra - array data there is no experimental data sample , sufficiently enriched with photons , that could be used for studying the photon - hadron separation .    as shown in @xcite useful variables in this context",
    "are @xmath45 and the ratio + @xmath41 : because hadron - induced showers in general develop more slowly after the shower maximum than photon - induced showers , the ratio @xmath41 at fixed position of the shower maximum ( estimated by @xmath45 @xcite ) is expected to be on the average larger for hadron than for photon showers .",
    "this behaviour is illustrated in fig .",
    "the photon - hadron difference is quite independent of @xmath46 and @xmath32 ( not shown ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] the experimental data are compared with the mc-(hadron + photon ) sample .",
    "the agreement for the average @xmath41 at fixed @xmath42 is not surprising because it is the result of the absolute calibrations , described in section 3.2 .",
    "mc studies have shown that the shape parameters of the lateral particle distribution , or alternatively the age parameter in the nkg function , as determined in the fit to the @xmath24 data from the scintillation detectors , have a potential for discriminating between photons and hadrons which may be superior to that of the variable @xmath45 .",
    "an approach in this direction was followed in @xcite . in the present analysis , however , this potential could not be exploited due to the unsatisfactory results of the comparison between experimental data and mc data : no good agreement was found in the distribution of the age parameter , the distribution being wider and shifted towards lower values in the mc data .",
    "the aim of the selection criteria is to select well reconstructed showers , to concentrate on energies close to the threshold of the hegra - array and to retain only data taken under good observation conditions .",
    "this is achieved by the set of requirements ( called ` standard selections ' in the following ) :    * @xmath47-probability of the global airobicc fit : @xmath48 * zenith angle @xmath49 * @xmath50 * fitted errors of the zenith angle @xmath32 and of the azimuthal angle @xmath51 : + @xmath52 , @xmath53 * fitted error on @xmath54 and @xmath55 position of the shower core : + @xmath56 * fitted error on @xmath46 : @xmath57 * @xmath47-probability of the maximum likelihood fit to the lateral particle distribution @xmath58 from the scintillation detectors : @xmath59 * fitted error on the total number of particles at the detector level : + @xmath60 * rejection of very - high - energy showers : + @xmath61 + this cut eliminates photon showers above @xmath62  320 tev , proton showers above @xmath62  640 tev and fe showers above @xmath62  1000 tev .",
    "the cut has to be applied in order to ensure consistent conditions for experimental data and mc data , which were generated only up to energies of 1000 tev .    out of",
    "the 163 million triggered showers 19.3 million pass the standard selections .",
    "the number of triggered showers ( 100% ) is reduced to 56% , 36% and 12% by requiring one after another a successful global airobicc fit , a successful fit to the lateral particle distribution @xmath63 and well reconstructed showers .",
    "the strong reduction is explained by the large experimental errors in showers which are close to the energy threshold of the trigger .                 as a function of @xmath42 for",
    "photon - induced ( full circles ) and hadron - induced ( open circles ) showers .",
