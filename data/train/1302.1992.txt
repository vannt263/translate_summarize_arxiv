    "the pygmy dipole resonance ( pdr ) is an electric dipole excitation located at energies close to the nucleon emission threshold , and called pygmy since its strength is much smaller than that of the well studied giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) @xcite .",
    "the reasons of the interest in the presence of the pdr can be grouped in three categories .",
    "a first type of motivations is related to nuclear astrophysics .",
    "the presence of a pdr in neutron rich nuclei , would increase the neutron capture cross section by orders of magnitude @xcite , and , consequently , also the rate of nucleosynthesis r - process .",
    "this effect could clarify the present discrepancy between simulations and observed abundance of medium - heavy nuclei in the solar system @xcite .",
    "a second type of reasons inducing the interest in the pdr is due to the relation between the presence of this resonance and the nuclear matter symmetry energy , and consequently , the connection with the neutron skin , the static dipole polarizability and the values of the landau s parameters of the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction @xcite .    finally , the third set of reasons to be interested in the pdr is related to a genuine curiosity about this new type of nuclear excitation .",
    "there are many aspects of this excitation to be clarified .",
    "for example , if the pdrs are present in all the medium and heavy nuclei or if this type of excitation is peculiar of neutron rich nuclei only .",
    "another question to be answered is whether these resonances are the low energy tail of the gdr or if they represent a different type of excitation .",
    "it also remains to be clarified if the pdrs are produced by collective nuclear motions or if they are generated by single particle ( s.p . )",
    "excitations related to the specific shell structure of nuclei with neutron excess , i.e. @xmath0 .",
    "our work has been mainly inspired by this last type of motivations .",
    "we have investigated the presence and the structure of the pdr in various medium - heavy nuclei , representative of different regions of the nuclear chart .",
    "the theoretical tool we have used in our study is the random phase approximation ( rpa ) theory .",
    "the first results of our study have been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite where we used a phenomenological rpa approach .",
    "basis was generated by using a woods - saxon well .",
    "the parameters of this well were fixed , for each isotope chain , in order to reproduce some empirical properties of the most investigated doubly magic nucleus of the chain .",
    "this implied that s.p .",
    "wave functions and energies were the same for each isotope of the chain .",
    "the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction used in those rpa calculations was a density dependent zero - range landau - migdal force , whose parameters were chosen to reproduce the energies of the low - lying @xmath1 states and the centroid energies of the gdr in @xmath2o , @xmath3ca and @xmath4pb nuclei .",
    "the main result of that investigation was the observation of dipole strength at energies lower than those of the gdr that increased with the neutron excess . in that region",
    "proton and neutron dipole transition densities were in phase , while they were out of phase in the gdr region .    from the theoretical point of view the main limitations of the previous investigation",
    "were the large number of parameters to be selected , and the rigid use of a s.p .",
    "basis within a given set of isotopes .",
    "we overcome these difficulties in the present study by adopting a self - consistent hartree - fock ( hf ) plus rpa approach .",
    "the effective interaction used in hf calculations to generate the s.p bases is also used in the rpa calculations .",
    "recently , we have proposed two parametrizations of the finite - range gogny interaction containing also tensor terms @xcite . however , since the presence of these terms is relevant only in magnetic excitations @xcite , in the present study we used the well tested d1s @xcite and the more modern d1 m @xcite gogny forces that do not include tensor terms .",
    "the parameters of these two interactions have been selected to reproduce some global nuclear properties , therefore each interaction is built to be used to investigate every nucleus in each region of the nuclear chart .",
    "contrary to what has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the present approach each nucleus has its own s.p . basis .",
    "the two parametrization produce similar results whose differences are not large enough to induce to different conclusions .",
    "for this reason we have restricted our presentation to the results obtained with the d1 m parametrization only .",
    "for our investigation we have selected a variety of nuclei with closed sub - shells and , therefore , with spherical symmetry . in this way , not only , we have avoided deformation problems , but we have also minimized the eventual pairing effects .",
    "we have chosen isotope chains containing at least a nucleus where experimental evidence of presence of pdr has been found : @xmath5o @xcite , @xmath6ca @xcite , @xmath7ni @xcite , @xmath8sn @xcite and @xmath4pb @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we briefly present the main features of our self - consistent hf+rpa model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : resu ] we present , and discuss , our results and in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "the first step of our procedure consists in constructing the s.p .",
    "basis by solving the hf equations .",
    "the technical details concerning the solution of the hf equations can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the second step ,",
    "the wave functions obtained in the hf calculation are used to solve the rpa equations by considering , without approximations , the fact that the main part of the s.p .",
    "wave functions above the fermi surface lies in the continuum .",
    "we have labeled continuum rpa ( crpa ) the results obtained in these calculations .",
    "the technique used to solve the crpa equations , which takes care of both direct and exchange matrix elements in the rpa , is based on expansions on a basis of sturm - bessel functions .",
    "the details of this approach can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . the number of the integration points and of the sturm - bessel functions to be used is easily determined by observing the numerical stability of the results ( see @xcite ) . apart from that ,",
    "crpa calculations are parameter free because the interaction is fixed .",
    "unfortunately , crpa calculations have two drawbacks .",
    "a first one is that the crpa equations are formulated with very involute expressions which make very difficult to disentangle the role of the various ingredients of the calculations , for example the relevance of specific particle - hole ( p - h ) excitations .",
    "the second problem is that the calculations are numerically very involved and , for large nuclei our technique suffers of numerical instability . for these reasons , together with the crpa calculations , we carried out rpa calculations where only a discrete set of s.p .",
    "wave functions is used .",
    "we call discrete rpa ( drpa ) this last type of calculations .",
    "the discrete configuration space is obtained in the hf calculation when the iterative procedure has reached the minimum value of the binding energy . at this point",
    ", we calculate the s.p .",
    "wave functions for all the states below the fermi surface , the hole states , and those for a large number of states above it , the particle states .",
    "this calculation is done by assuming that the system is confined in a spherical box with infinite walls .    as it is traditionally done @xcite , in this drpa approach the secular equations written in matrix form are solved by diagonalizing the rpa matrix .",
    "the dimensions of this matrix are given by the number of the p - h pairs contributing to the excitation .",
    "therefore , the results of these drpa calculations depend on both the size of the box considered for the hf calculations and the number of particle states composing the configuration space . the choice of the values of these two parameters has been done by controlling the centroid energies of the giant dipole responses .",
    "we have chosen a box radius of 30 fm for the calculations in oxygen , calcium and nickel isotopes , of 40 fm for zirconium and tin isotopes , and of 45 fm for lead .",
    "for all the nuclei , but @xmath4pb , we have selected a configuration space such as the maximum p - h excitation energy is 100 mev . for @xmath4pb",
    "this would have generated matrices with too large dimensions , therefore we have chosen a maximum value of 60 mev .",
    "we have taken care that the centroid energies did not change by more than 0.5 mev when either the box size , or the configuration space were enlarged .    in our self - consistent hf plus rpa approach , the spurious center of mass motion , showing up as an isoscalar 1@xmath9 excitation , should appear at zero energy @xcite .",
    "this is what happens in the crpa calculations where we do not observe any effect due to the presence of this spurious excited state . on the contrary , this spurious state is present in all our drpa results .",
    "this is due to the truncation of the configuration space . in the great majority of the cases",
    "we have investigated this state is easily identifiable and is well isolated form the other ones . on the other hand",
    ", we observe that for the @xmath10o , @xmath6ni @xmath11sn and @xmath4pb nuclei the spurious state appearing in the range 1.53.0 mev is mixed with other excited states . in the drpa results which will be presented in the next section , the spurious states have been eliminated by hand . in the study of the isoscalar excitations , and of the transition densities , we subtracted the contribution of the spurious state by using the prescriptions of refs . @xcite and @xcite and we found that , from the quantitative point of view , the two procedures are equivalent . in any case",
    ", a comparison with the transition densities obtained without the subtraction of the spurious states does not show numerically relevant differences .",
    "the nuclei we have considered are listed in table [ tab : nuclei ] . as already pointed out , in these nuclei , the s.p .",
    "levels are fully occupied , and this implies a spherical shape .",
    "furthermore , the pairing effects are negligible .",
    "these features are confirmed by the deformed hartree - fock - bogolioubov calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    ".nuclei considered in our calculations .",
    "for each nucleus we show the energy used to separate the pdr and gdr regions , @xmath12 , and the energies @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the discrete states we consider representative of these two regions .",
    "all the energy values are expressed in mev . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have investigated the pygmy and giant dipole excitations in a set of 18 spherical nuclei in various mass regions .",
    "we have conducted our study by doing self - consistent rpa calculations with the finite range d1 m gogny interaction .",
    "we carried out discrete and continuum rpa calculations , the latter ones for 13 nuclei lighter than @xmath11sn .",
    "we have verified the convergence of the discrete and continuum results . for each nucleus",
    "considered we have separated the two energy regions identifying the pygmy and the giant responses .",
    "centroid energies and sum rule exhaustion are conserved in both discrete and continuum rpa calculations in each energy region .      1 .   the dipole strength at energies around the nucleon emission threshold increases with the neutron excess .",
    "the pdr exhausts about 5% of the total energy weighted sum rule , while the gdr about the 90% .",
    "3 .   the values of the collectivity indexes @xmath15 and @xmath16 , eqs . (",
    "[ eq : doc ] ) and ( [ eq : coh ] ) , indicate that the gdrs are more collective than the pdrs .",
    "the pdr is dominated by the neutron p - h excitations , while in the gdr the contributions of both proton and neutron excitations are comparable . 5 .   at the nuclear surface ,",
    "proton and neutron transition densities are in phase in the pdr region , while they are out of phase in the gdr region .",
    "the neutron transition densities of the pdr states are dominated by the motion of the neutrons in excess . in the gdr both",
    "the neutrons in excess and those of the core contribute to the excitation .",
    "the scalar and isospin terms of the effective interaction have opposite effects on the pdr , the former is attractive and the latter repulsive . in any case",
    "these effects are much smaller than those produced by the interaction on the gdr .",
    "our investigation indicates that , as it has been suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite , the emergence of the pdr is an effect more related to the shell structure of the various isotopes than to a real collective nuclear motion .",
    "the limits of our investigation are related to the validity of the intrinsic hypotheses of the theory we used , the rpa .",
    "specifically , we refer to the fact that in rpa the excited states are described as linear combination of one particle - one hole , and one hole - one particle , excitations .",
    "the role of configurations beyond rpa on the pdr was investigated in @xcite where a redistribution of the strength was pointed out as the main effect .",
    "this generate strength also at energies lower than those indicated by rpa calculations @xcite .",
    "a detailed comparison with the future experimental data would require the use of self - consistent theories beyond rpa @xcite .",
    "in any case , the main results of our investigation depend on the global properties of the excitation , rather than on the detailed distribution of the strength . for this reason ,",
    "we believe that they would not be changed by theories more elaborated than rpa .    this work has been partially supported by the prin ( italy ) _ struttura e dinamica dei nuclei fuori dalla valle di",
