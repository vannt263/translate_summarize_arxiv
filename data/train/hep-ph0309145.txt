    "the recent decade of investigating deep inelastic scattering at small bjorken @xmath0 at hera has provided precise data for the @xmath1 structure function or equivalently for @xmath2 at large center - of - mass energies .",
    "many phenomenological analyses have been performed in order to fit the data .",
    "one group of models tries to fit the data using the so - called dipole representation . in this approach ,",
    "initiated in ref.@xcite , one fits parameters of the dipole - nucleon interaction @xcite as a function of the transverse @xmath3 distance .",
    "the fits in the dipole representation take into account only a simple quark - antiquark fock component of the photon .",
    "however , the higher fock components seem to be important to understand the diffraction @xcite .",
    "the first theoretical step in going beyond the @xmath3 component has been undertaken only recently @xcite .",
    "however , no quantitative estimates exist up to now . on the phenomenological side ,",
    "the jet production in virtual - photon - proton scattering , especially at small photon virtuality , shows clearly the presence of the resolved photon component ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the resolved photon component seems also crucial for understanding the world data for the @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "all these arguments put into question the simple fits to the total photon - nucleon cross section with the colour dipole component alone , and call for a multi - component parametrization .",
    "it is known that the lo total @xmath5 cross section in the so - called dipole or mixed representation can be written in the form @xmath6 in this paper we take the so - called quark - antiquark photon wave function of perturbative form @xcite . as usual , in order to correct the photon wave function for large dipole sizes we introduce an effective ( anti)quark mass ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the dipole representation ( [ dipole_nucleon ] ) has been used in recent years to fit the virtual photon - nucleon total cross section @xcite .",
    "the best fit has been achieved in the saturation model of golec - biernat - wsthoff @xcite . in their approach",
    "the dipole - nucleon cross section was parametrized as @xmath8 \\ ; , \\label{gbw_dipole_nucleon}\\ ] ] where the bjorken @xmath0 dependent radius @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 .",
    "model parameters ( normalization constant @xmath11 and parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) have been determined by the fit to the inclusive data on @xmath1 for @xmath14 0.01 @xcite .    in the gbw approach ,",
    "the dipole - nucleon cross section is parametrized as a function of bjorken @xmath0 . as discussed in @xcite , it would be useful to have rather a parametrization in the gluon longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath15 instead of the bjorken @xmath0 .",
    "having @xmath16 instead of bjorken - x better reflects the kinematics of the process and is consistent with the standard approach to photon - gluon fusion .",
    "this involves the following replacement in eq.([gbw_dipole_nucleon ] ) @xmath17 which means also a replacement of @xmath0 by @xmath16 in @xmath9 . as discussed in @xcite , an exact calculation of @xmath16 in the dipole representation",
    "is , however , not possible , and we approximate @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "we intend to construct a simple two - component model . one component of our phenomenological model is the dipole @xmath3 component , while the other one is meant to represent the nonperturbative resolved photon component explicitly .",
    "trying to keep our model as simple as possible we have tried to check if the standard vector dominance model ( vdm ) contribution can be a reasonable representation of the resolved photon .",
    "the cross section for the vdm component is calculated in the standard way @xmath20 we take the simplest diagonal version of vdm with @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 mesons included .",
    "other details can be found in @xcite .",
    "in the previous section we presented formulae for the virtual photon - nucleon cross section . we transform the structure function data from @xcite to @xmath24 .",
    "then we perform two independent fits to the hera data . in fit 1 , only dipole nucleon interaction is included ( see eq.([dipole_nucleon ] ) ) @xmath25 in fit 2 in addition we include the resolved photon component in the spirit of the vector meson dominance model ( see eq.([vdm_component ] ) ) @xmath26 in these fits we limit to 0.15 gev@xmath27 @xmath28 10 gev@xmath29 .",
    "the upper limit is dictated by the simplicity of our model .",
    "the maximal bjorken @xmath0 in the data sample included in our fit is 0.021 , and minimal w = 17.4 gev .",
    "the region of small @xmath30 is sensitive to the value of the effective quark mass .",
    "a good quality fit can be obtained in the broad range of @xmath31 .",
    "the value of @xmath32 in fit 2 ( dipole+vdm ) is smaller than that in fit 1 ( dipole only ) .",
    "this can be taken as the evidence for resolved photon component .",
    "dipole and vdm )  cross sections as a  function of q@xmath29 .",
    "the hera data taken from @xcite.,width=302 ]    the quality of the fit can be judged by inspecting fig.1 .",
    "since there is a rather weak dependence of the cross section on @xmath33 , therefore in the figure both theoretical curves and experimental points are rescaled by an extra factor 2@xmath34 .",
    "careful comparison of fit 1 and fit 2 shows the superiority of the fit 2 in the region of small @xmath30 and large energies @xcite . in presenting the results",
    "we have made an arbitrary choice of @xmath31 .",
    "the results for other sets of parameters ( different @xmath31 ) are almost indistinguishable in the range of the fit .",
    "they differ somewhat , however , outside the range of the fit where no experimental data are available .",
    "the theoretical curves with dipole component only underestimate somewhat the low @xmath30 data .",
    "having shown that a good - quality two - component fit to the hera data with very small number of parameters is possible , we wish to show a decomposition of the cross section into the two model components . in fig.2 , as an example , we show separate contributions of both components as a function of @xmath33 . while at low energy the vdm contribution dominates due to the subleading reggeon exchange , at higher energies they are of comparable size .",
    "the vdm contribution dominates at small values of photon virtualities , while at larger @xmath30 the dipole component becomes dominant .",
    "cross section into dipole ( dotted ) and vdm ( dashed ) contributions for 4 different values of photon virtuality in gev@xmath29.,width=302 ]    up to now we have concentrated on very low-@xmath0 region relevant for dis at hera .",
    "it is interesting to check what happens if we go to somewhat larger bjorken @xmath35 0.05 . in this region",
    "one can not neglect the valence quark contribution to the cross section .",
    "then the cross section is a sum of three components : @xmath36 we have found a good quality description of the fixed target data @xcite .",
    "recent fits to the total @xmath37 cross section in the literature include only the @xmath3 component in the fock decomposition of the photon wave function .",
    "it is known from the phenomenology of the inclusive and exclusive reactions that the vector dominance model in many cases gives a good estimate of the effects characteristic for resolved photon .",
    "we have analyzed if a two - component model , which includes the @xmath3 component and the more complicated components replaced by the standard vdm , can provide a good description of the hera data for @xmath37 scattering .    in order to quantify the effect of the resolved photon",
    "we have performed two different fits to the hera data . in fit no.1",
    "we include only the dipole component .",
    "we have parametrized the dipole - nucleon cross section in terms of a variable which is closer to the gluon longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath16 than to the bjorken @xmath0 . in fit no.2 ,",
    "in addition we include the vdm component while keeping the same functional form of parametrization for the dipole - nucleon interaction . at small @xmath30 and large energies a better fit",
    "is obtained if the resolved photon component is included . when going to slightly larger bjorken @xmath35 0.05 , the model must be supplemented for valence quark contribution .",
    "if this is done , the model describes also the fixed target data quite well .",
