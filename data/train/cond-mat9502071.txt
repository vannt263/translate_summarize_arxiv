    "recent progress in the intrinsic interband spectroscopy @xcite of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) @xcite made a demand for developing a theory of optical phenomena accounting in an appropriate way the basic properties of fqhe phases .",
    "such a theory has to reflect two essential facts : i ) an exciton nature of the low - energy states in a strong magnetic field , and ii ) the presence of an incompressible quantum liquid ( iql ) @xcite underlying the fqhe .",
    "therefore , the theory should describe an exciton against a background of an iql .",
    "there are two approaches to this problem . the first one is based on exact numerical treatment of few - electron systems in a spherical geometry @xcite .",
    "the second one is based on the anyon exciton ( ae ) model @xcite which considers an exciton as a neutral entity consisting of a valence hole and several quasielectrons ( qe s ) carrying fractional negative charges .",
    "these both approaches have a restricted applicability depending on the value of the parameter @xmath6 , here @xmath7 is the separation between electron and hole confinement planes and @xmath8 is the magnetic length .",
    "reliable calculations in a spherical geometry are accessible only for @xmath9 . on the contrary",
    ", the ae approach fails when @xmath6 is small , but is exact in the opposite limit @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , by electrostatic arguments the size of an ae ground state is about @xmath7 , and the model is applicable when the mean distance between anyons is large as compared to the anyon size which is about @xmath11 ; in the same limit the perturbation exerted by a hole is small .",
    "there is our believe that both approaches will result in a similar picture in the intermediate region @xmath12 and , therefore , taken together they will provide a description of excitons in the whole region of the @xmath6 values .",
    "experimental data on excitons are not avalable for the region @xmath13 yet , and therefore a comparison with the experiment can not be performed at present .",
    "for this reason we abstain from discussing the involved problem of the transition probabilities @xcite and concentrate on the energy spectra and electron density distribution .",
    "the relation between the results of the ae approach and of computations for few - particle systems is discussed in the last section .",
    "the oversimplified model of an ae consisting of a hole and two semions ( anyons having charges @xmath14 has been developed by us previously @xcite . in that paper a multiple - branch spectrum of an ae has been established as a basic signature of the charge fractionalization in iql s .",
    "recent data @xcite have revealed the appearance of this structure also in few - particle computations .",
    "it is remarkable that several new exciton branches appear at very moderate values of @xmath15 . in what follows we present for the first time a theory for a realistic case of three qe s which corresponds to a @xmath16 iql .",
    "let us consider an exciton consisting of a valence hole with a charge @xmath17 and three qe s with electrical charges @xmath0 and statistical charges @xmath18 ( @xmath19 for bosons and @xmath20 for fermions ) . in the strong @xmath21 limit , when the coulomb energy @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the cyclotron frequency , it is convenient to use dimentionless variables scaled in units @xmath24 , @xmath11 and @xmath25",
    ". instead of hole , @xmath26 , and anyon , @xmath27 , coordinates it is convenient to introduce the following two - dimensional coordinates : @xmath28 complex coordinates @xmath29 , as well as @xmath30 , are not independent . indeed : @xmath31 since ae is a neutral entity it possesses an in - plane momentum @xmath32 @xcite . as a basis for the exciton wave functions in the halperin s quasi wave function representation @xcite the functions @xmath33 may be chosen . here",

    "the only symmetric polynomial with @xmath48 is a vandermonde determinant in the variables @xmath52 : @xmath53 as distinct from the polynomials @xmath54 with even @xmath3 , which are symmetric both in the bosonic permutations @xmath55 and permutations @xmath56 , etc .",
    ", the polynomial @xmath57 is symmetric in the permutations of the first and antisymmetric in the permutations of the second type .",
    "all independent odd-@xmath3 polynomials can be represented in the form : @xmath58 to our best knowledge , in the previous studies only the even-@xmath3 polynomials have been taken into account @xcite .",

    "the set of quantum numbers consists of @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the only disadvantage of the functions @xmath61 is that the scalar products @xmath62 for @xmath63 . as a result",
    ", the matrix @xmath64 of these scalar products which is diagonal in @xmath32 and @xmath3 has a block - diagonal form ; the block sizes increase with @xmath3 .",

    "we show here the transformation of a matrix element with polynomials @xmath54 substituted by monomials @xmath74 . after the @xmath72-function transformation",
    "the matrix element takes the form : @xmath75 where @xmath76 here @xmath77 ,   @xmath78 is the azimuth of @xmath73 ,   and @xmath79 is a confluent hypergeometric function .",

    "[ eq3 ] differ from bosonic functions only by a statistical factor @xmath80 .",
    "it is of most importance for small values of @xmath81 .",
    "for the same distances the deviation of the anyon - anyon interaction law from a coulomb law @xcite also should be taken into account and results in comparable contributions . in what follows we",
    "restrict ourselves with a coulomb interaction in the hamiltonian @xmath82  , where @xmath83 and @xmath84  , and omit the statistical factor in @xmath61 .",
    "this last approximation strongly simplifies all calculations . indeed , with @xmath19 all functions @xmath79 , eq .",

    "this latter function can not be reduced to a polynomial , hence , one - fold integration over @xmath91 should be performed numerically .",
    "the most complicated are the matrix elements of @xmath92  . to simplify them it is convenient to perform a fourier transformation @xmath93  . in this representation",
    "the integrand contains again three factors @xmath94  .",

    "we choose @xmath61 in such a way that the matrix elements of @xmath97 are real , and the diagonal elements of @xmath64 equal unity .",

    "the anyon - hole attraction becomes smaller , the effect being stronger the less is @xmath3 .",

    "[ f3 ] that only the states with @xmath4 ,  @xmath128 are integers , reach the spectrum bottom .",

    "the periodicity with the period @xmath129 resembles the laughlin s result @xcite for a three - electron system .",
    "we attribute this periodicity in @xmath3 to the quantization rule for identical particles , since the rotation angle between two exchange points ( which enters into the semiclassical quantization rule @xcite ) equals @xmath130 .",

    "it is just the result which is expected in the @xmath144 limit from electrostatic arguments .",
    "the value of @xmath145 , found both as a mean value in a @xmath146 state and by the semiclassical approach in terms of the distances between anyon guiding centers @xcite , satisfies the equation @xmath147 .",
    "the density distribution for @xmath148 shows a single maximum , fig .",
    "2 . in the vicinity of it",
    "the three - particle correlation function reaches the maximum for an equilateral triangle configuration of anyons with @xmath149 . in this respect the functions @xmath150 and @xmath151 show a similar behavior . a strong difference between them is reflected in the anyon two - particle correlation functions @xmath152 : @xmath153 they are shown in fig .

    "the function @xmath154 has a hard core behavior , while @xmath155 reaches its absolute maximum at @xmath124 and has the second maximum which is only by a factor 0.97 lower than the main one . of course ,",
    "all bottom state odd-@xmath3 polynomials with @xmath156 show a hard core behavior .",
    "it follows from the above data that with increasing @xmath7 the charge fractionalization results in the broadening of the anyon density distribution in the low - energy @xmath1 states .",
    "the dependence of the exciton binding energy on @xmath7 is close to the coulomb law , but the numerator is considerably less than unity . in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] the energy of an ordinary @xmath1 magnetoexciton , @xmath157 , is shown for comparison . because of the existence of a hidden symmetry , @xmath157 gives an exact result in the @xmath158 limit .",

    "the both curves should be matched somewhere in the intermediate region , @xmath160 .",

    "[ sec : theory ] , one can expect that with increasing @xmath2 the electron density splits into bundles , their charges being multiples of @xmath163 .",
    "the splitting of the electron shell into two well separated quasiparticles has been observed previously for a two - semion exciton @xcite . for a three - anyon exciton",
    "the pattern are much more impressive .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] for @xmath138 when the criterion of the large electron - hole separation is fulfilled .",
    "the distribution which is cylindrically symmetric for @xmath1 transforms with increasing @xmath2 into a distribution with a single split off anyon , @xmath164 and 3 .",
    "two anyons constituting the exciton core show a slight but distinct splitting in a perpendicular direction",
    ". this core changes its shape with @xmath2 , but remains stable for a long .",
    "finally , for rather large @xmath2 values , it splits in the @xmath119 direction as it is seen in the last figure , @xmath165 . in all figures the center - of - mass of the electron density is at the point @xmath166 , and the asymmetric distribution of the density arises due to the odd-@xmath3 polynomials . in the absence of them the distribution had to be symmetric with respect to the point @xmath119 .",
    "the well outlined profiles of the electron density seen in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] may be somewhat smeared by the oscillatory screening inherent in iql s @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the basic pattern of the charge separation in an exciton should strongly influence the @xmath2 dependence of the magnetoroton - assisted recombination processes since charge density excitations are left in a crystal afterwards .",
    "the above theory is based on a coulomb interaction between all the particles and neglecting the statistical factor @xmath167 in eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] . for small @xmath3 values",
    "the theory results in dense states which can not be described by the ae model , and for larger @xmath3 values in more loose states to which the ae model should be applicable . the @xmath168 state or , more probable ,",
    "the @xmath169 state are the first candidates .",
    "if one takes into account the statistical factor , the effective repulsion of anyons should increase .",
    "therefore , we expect that the critical value of @xmath7 , @xmath170 , when the loose states reach the spectrum bottom must decrease . according to fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , @xmath171 in the ae model , while the computations in the spherical geometry result in @xmath172 for @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "these data are in a reasonable agreement .",
    "the more intriguing question is whether the realistic anyon form - factors and quasipotentials may result in some new types of the @xmath1 ground states , e.g. , the two - scale states like the low - energy component of the @xmath125 state in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] , @xmath173 .",
    "it has been proposed by apalkov and rashba @xcite , that the two - scale exciton observed by them in computations for a @xmath16 iql consisted of a two - anyon core and a split off anyon ( it resembles the exciton shown in our fig .",
    "[ f6 ] , @xmath164 , if described in the @xmath174 rather than @xmath32 representation ) .",
    "such a configuration may be energetically favorable for a @xmath1 exciton if the two - qe repulsion at small distances is suppressed well below its coulomb value .",
    "this hypothesis is in agreement with the data of bran and morf @xcite .",
    "therefore , the configurations of anyon shells of ae s with moderate values of @xmath7 are expected to be sensitive to the qe interaction law , and calculations based on realistic quasipotentials are desirable .",
