    "a _ tournament _ is an orientation of a complete graph and a hamilton cycle in a tournament is a ( consistently oriented ) cycle which contains all the vertices of the tournament .",
    "hamilton cycles in tournaments have a long and rich history .",
    "for instance , one of the most basic results about tournaments is camion s theorem , which states that every strongly connected tournament has a hamilton cycle  @xcite .",
    "this is strengthened by moon s theorem  @xcite , which implies that such a tournament is even pancyclic , i.e.  contains cycles of all possible lengths .",
    "many related results have been proved ; the monograph by bang - jensen and gutin  @xcite gives an overview which also includes many recent results .    in 1982 , thomassen  @xcite made a very natural conjecture on how to guarantee not just one hamilton cycle , but many edge - disjoint ones : he conjectured that for every @xmath0 there is an @xmath1 so that every strongly @xmath1-connected tournament contains @xmath0 edge - disjoint hamilton cycles ( see also the recent surveys  @xcite ) .",
    "this turned out to be surprisingly difficult : not even the existence of @xmath3 was known so far .",
    "our main result shows that @xmath7 .",
    "[ thm : thomconj ] there exists @xmath8 such that for all @xmath9 with @xmath10 every strongly @xmath11-connected tournament contains @xmath0 edge - disjoint hamilton cycles .",
    "in proposition  [ thm : example ] , we describe an example which shows that @xmath12 , i.e.  our bound on the connectivity is asymptotically close to best possible .",
    "thomassen  @xcite observed that @xmath13 and conjectured that @xmath14 .",
    "he also observed that one can not weaken the assumption in theorem  [ thm : thomconj ] by replacing strong connectivity with strong edge - connectivity .    to simplify the presentation , we have made no attempt to optimize the value of the constant  @xmath15 .",
    "our exposition shows that one can take @xmath16 for @xmath17 . rather than proving theorem  [ thm : thomconj ] directly",
    ", we deduce it as an immediate consequence of two further results , which are both of independent interest : we show that every sufficiently highly connected tournament is highly linked ( see theorem  [ thm : linkedness ] ) and show that every highly linked tournament contains many edge - disjoint hamilton cycles ( see theorem  [ thm : mainresult ] ) .",
    "given sets @xmath18 , @xmath19 of size @xmath0 in a strongly @xmath0-connected digraph  @xmath20 , menger s theorem implies that @xmath20 contains @xmath0 vertex - disjoint paths from @xmath18 to @xmath19 . in a @xmath0-linked digraph",
    ", we can even specify the initial and final vertex of each such path ( see section  [ sec : notation ] for the precise definition ) .",
    "[ thm : mainresult ] there exists @xmath21 such that for all @xmath9 with @xmath10 every @xmath22-linked tournament contains @xmath0 edge - disjoint hamilton cycles .",
    "the bound in theorem  [ thm : mainresult ] is asymptotically close to best possible , as we shall discuss below .",
    "we will show that @xmath23 works for all @xmath24 .",
    "( as mentioned earlier , we have made no attempt to optimise the value of this constant . )",
    "it is not clear from the definition that every ( very ) highly connected tournament is also highly linked .",
    "in fact , for general digraphs this is far from true : thomassen  @xcite showed that for all @xmath0 there are strongly @xmath0-connected digraphs which are not even @xmath25-linked . on the other hand , he showed that there is an ( exponential ) function @xmath26 so that every strongly @xmath26-connected tournament is @xmath0-linked  @xcite .",
    "the next result shows that we can take @xmath26 to be almost linear in @xmath0 .",
    "note that this result together with proposition  [ thm : example ] shows that theorem  [ thm : mainresult ] is asymptotically best possible up to logarithmic terms .",
    "[ thm : linkedness ] for all @xmath27 with @xmath10 every strongly @xmath28-connected tournament is @xmath0-linked .    for small  @xmath0 ,",
    "the constant @xmath29 can easily be improved ( see theorem  [ thm : small ] ) . the proof of theorem  [ thm : linkedness ] is based on a fundamental result of ajtai , komls and szemerdi  @xcite on the existence of asymptotically optimal sorting networks . though their result is asymptotically optimal , it is not clear whether this is the case for theorem  [ thm : linkedness ] .",
    "in fact , for the case of ( undirected ) graphs , a deep result of bollobs and thomason  @xcite states that every @xmath30-connected graph is @xmath0-linked ( this was improved to  @xmath31 by thomas and wollan  @xcite ) .",
    "thus one might believe that a similar relation also holds in the case of tournaments :    [ conj : linkage ] there exists @xmath8 such that for all @xmath27 every strongly @xmath32-connected tournament is @xmath0-linked .",
    "similarly , we believe that the logarithmic terms can also be removed in theorems  [ thm : thomconj ] and  [ thm : mainresult ] :    [ conj : cycles ] @xmath33    1 .   there exists @xmath21 such that for all @xmath27 every @xmath34-linked tournament contains @xmath0 edge - disjoint hamilton cycles .",
    "there exists @xmath35 such that for all @xmath27 every strongly @xmath36-connected tournament contains @xmath0 edge - disjoint hamilton cycles .",
    "note that conjectures  [ conj : linkage ] and  [ conj : cycles](i ) together imply conjecture  [ conj : cycles](ii ) .",
    "both hamiltonicity and linkedness in tournaments have also been studied from an algorithmic perspective .",
    "camion s theorem implies that the hamilton cycle problem ( though np - complete in general ) is solvable in polynomial time for tournaments .",
    "chudnovsky , scott and seymour  @xcite solved a long - standing problem of bang - jensen and thomassen  @xcite by showing that the linkedness problem is also solvable in polynomial time for tournaments .",
    "more precisely , for a given tournament on @xmath37 vertices , one can determine in time polynomial in @xmath37 whether it is @xmath0-linked and if yes , one can produce a corresponding set of @xmath0 paths ( also in polynomial time ) .",
    "fortune , hopcroft and wyllie  @xcite showed that for general digraphs , the problem is np - complete even for @xmath38 .",
    "we can use the result in  @xcite to obtain an algorithmic version of theorem  [ thm : mainresult ] .",
    "more precisely , given a @xmath39-linked tournament on @xmath37 vertices , one can find @xmath0 edge - disjoint hamilton cycles in time polynomial in @xmath37 ( where @xmath0 is fixed ) .",
    "we discuss this in more detail in section  [ concluding ] .",
    "note that this immediately results in an algorithmic version of theorem  [ thm : thomconj ] .",
    "proposition  [ thm : example ] actually suggests that the ` bottleneck ' to finding @xmath0 edge - disjoint hamilton cycles is the existence of a @xmath0-regular subdigraph : it states that if the connectivity of a tournament @xmath40 is significantly lower than in theorem  [ thm : thomconj ] , then @xmath40 may not even contain a spanning @xmath0-regular subdigraph .",
    "there are other results which exhibit this phenomenon : if @xmath40 is itself regular , then kelly s conjecture from 1968 states that @xmath40 itself has a hamilton decomposition .",
    "kelly s conjecture was proved very recently ( for large tournaments ) by khn and osthus  @xcite .",
    "erds raised a ` probabilistic ' version of kelly s conjecture : for a tournament @xmath40 , let @xmath41 denote the minimum of the minimum out - degree and the minimum in - degree .",
    "he conjectured that for almost all tournaments @xmath40 , the maximum number of edge - disjoint hamilton cycles in @xmath40 is exactly @xmath41 .",
    "in particular , this would imply that with high probability , @xmath41 is also the degree of a densest spanning regular subdigraph in a random tournament  @xmath40 .",
    "this conjecture of erds was proved by khn and osthus  @xcite , based on the main result in  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to obtain further conditions which relate the degree of the densest spanning regular subdigraph of a tournament  @xmath40 to the number of edge - disjoint hamilton cycles in  @xmath40 .",
    "for undirected graphs , one such conjecture was made in  @xcite : it states that for any graph  @xmath42 satisfying the conditions of dirac s theorem , the number of edge - disjoint hamilton cycles in @xmath42 is exactly half the degree of a densest spanning even - regular subgraph of  @xmath42 . an approximate version of this conjecture was proved by ferber , krivelevich and sudakov  @xcite , see e.g.  @xcite for some related results .",
    "the methods used in the current paper are quite different from those used e.g.  in the papers mentioned in section  [ relresults ] .",
    "a crucial ingredient is the construction of highly structured dominating sets ( see section  [ sec : proofsketch ] for an informal description ) .",
    "we believe that this approach will have further applications .    in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the notation that will be used for the remainder of the paper . in section  [ sec :",
    "proofsketch ] , we give an overview of the proof of theorem  [ thm : mainresult ] . in sections  [ sec :",
    "linkedness ] and  [ sec : example ] , we give the relatively short proofs of theorem  [ thm : linkedness ] and proposition  [ thm : example ] . in section  [ sec : onecycle ] , we show that given a ` linked domination structure ' ( as introduced in the proof sketch ) , we can find a single hamilton cycle ( lemma  [ lem : mainengine ] ) . in section  [ sec :",
    "manycycles ] , we show that given several suitable linked domination structures , we can repeatedly apply lemma  [ lem : mainengine ] to find @xmath0 edge - disjoint hamilton cycles . in section  [ sec : linkagegood ] we show that any highly linked tournament contains such suitable linked domination structures .",
    "finally , section  [ concluding ] contains some concluding remarks .",

    "we write @xmath121 for the binary logarithm and @xmath122 .",
    "in this section , we give an outline of the proof of theorem  [ thm : mainresult ] .",
    "an important idea is the notion of a ` covering edge ' .",
    "given a small ( pre - determined ) set  @xmath123 of vertices in a tournament @xmath40 , this will mean that it will suffice to find a cycle covering all vertices of @xmath124 .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath40 be a tournament , let @xmath125 , and suppose @xmath15 is a cycle in @xmath40 covering @xmath126 . if @xmath127 and @xmath128 , then we can replace @xmath129 by @xmath130 in @xmath15 to turn @xmath15 into a hamilton cycle .",
    "we call @xmath129 a _ covering edge _ for @xmath43",
    ". more generally , if @xmath131 and @xmath15 is a cycle in @xmath40 spanning @xmath132 such that @xmath15 contains a covering edge for each @xmath133 , then we can turn @xmath15 into a hamilton cycle by using all these covering edges .",
    "note that this idea still works if @xmath15 covers some part of @xmath123 .",
    "on the other hand , note that  @xmath123 needs to be fixed at the beginning  this is different than in the recently popularized ` absorbing method ' .",
    "another important tool will be the following consequence of the gallai - milgram theorem : suppose that @xmath42 is an oriented graph on @xmath37 vertices with @xmath134 .",
    "then the vertices of @xmath42 can be covered with @xmath135 vertex - disjoint paths .",
    "we use this as follows : suppose we are given a highly linked tournament @xmath40 and have already found @xmath136 edge - disjoint hamilton cycles in  @xmath40 . then the gallai - milgram theorem implies that we can cover the vertices of the remaining oriented graph by a set of @xmath137 vertex - disjoint paths . very roughly , the aim is to link together these paths using the high linkedness of the original tournament @xmath40 .    to achieve this aim ,",
    "we introduce and use the idea of ` transitive dominating sets ' . here a transitive out - dominating set @xmath138 has the following properties :    * @xmath138 out - dominates @xmath139 , i.e.  every vertex of @xmath139 receives an edge from  @xmath138 .",
    "* @xmath138 induces a transitive tournament in @xmath40 .",
    "transitive in - dominating sets @xmath140 are defined similarly .",
    "now suppose that we have already found @xmath136 edge - disjoint hamilton cycles in a highly linked tournament  @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath141 be the oriented subgraph of @xmath40 obtained by removing the edges of these hamilton cycles .",
    "suppose that we also have the following ` linked dominating structure ' in @xmath141 , which consists of :    * small disjoint transitive out - dominating sets @xmath142 , where @xmath143 ; * small disjoint transitive in - dominating sets @xmath144 ; * a set of short vertex - disjoint paths @xmath145 , where each @xmath146 is a path from the head @xmath147 of @xmath140 to the tail @xmath148 of @xmath138 .",
    "recall that the head of a transitive tournament is the vertex of out - degree zero and the tail is defined analogously .",
    "the paths @xmath146 are found at the outset of the proof , using the assumption that the original tournament  @xmath40 is highly linked .",
    "( note that @xmath141 need not be highly linked . )    let @xmath149 denote the union of the @xmath150 and let @xmath151 denote the union of the @xmath152 .",
    "note that @xmath153 .",
    "so the gallai - milgram theorem implies that we can cover the vertices of @xmath154 with @xmath155 vertex - disjoint paths @xmath156 .",
    "now we can link up successive paths using the above dominating sets as follows .",
    "the final vertex of @xmath157 sends an edge to some vertex @xmath158 in @xmath159 ( since @xmath159 is in - dominating ) .",
    "either @xmath158 is equal to the head @xmath160 of @xmath159 or there is an edge in @xmath161 $ ] from @xmath158 to @xmath160 ( since @xmath161 $ ] is a transitive tournament ) .",
    "now follow the path @xmath162 from @xmath160 to the tail @xmath163 of @xmath164 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath165 $ ] is transitive and that @xmath164 is out - dominating , we can similarly find a path of length at most two from @xmath163 to the initial vertex of @xmath166 . continuing in this way",
    ", we can link up all the paths @xmath167 and @xmath146 into a single cycle @xmath15 which covers all vertices outside @xmath168 ( and some of the vertices inside @xmath168 ) .",
