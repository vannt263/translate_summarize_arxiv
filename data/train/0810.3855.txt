    "<S> +    introduction and statement of the results let @xmath1 be a @xmath2-dimensional , @xmath3 , compact , connected and boundaryless riemaniann manifold endowed with a volume - form @xmath4 and let @xmath5 denote the lebesgue measure associated to it . </S>",
    "<S> we denote by @xmath6 the space of @xmath0 vector fields @xmath7 over @xmath1 such that @xmath7 is _ divergence - free _ , that is its associated flow @xmath8 preserves the measure @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider @xmath6 endowed with the usual whitney @xmath0-topology .    </S>",
    "<S> given a flow @xmath8 one usually deduces properties of it by studying its linear approximation . </S>",
    "<S> one way to do that is by considering the lyapunov exponents which , in broad terms , detect if there are any exponential behavior of the linear tangent map along orbits . </S>",
    "<S> given @xmath9 the existence of lyapunov exponents for almost every point is guaranteed by oseledets theorem ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> positive ( or negative ) exponents assure , in average , exponential rate of divergence ( or convergence ) of two neighboring trajectories , whereas zero exponents give us the lack of any kind of average exponential behavior . </S>",
    "<S> a flow is said to be _ nonuniformly hyperbolic _ if its lyapunov exponents are all different from zero . in  @xcite hu , pesin and talitskaya gave examples of nonuniformly hyperbolic flows in any manifold . </S>",
    "<S> non - zero exponents plus some smoothness assumptions on the flow allows us to obtain invariant manifolds dynamically defined ( see  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> since this stable / unstable manifold theory is the base of capital results on dynamical systems nowadays it is of extreme importance to detect when we have nonzero lyapunov exponents .    in the beginning of the 1980 ricardo ma , in  @xcite , announced a dichotomy for @xmath0-generic discrete - time conservative systems which in broad terms says that for lebesgue almost every point its lyapunov exponents are all equal to zero or else there exists a weak form of uniform hyperbolicity along its orbit .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that hyperbolicity plays a crucial role if one wants to obtain stability . </S>",
    "<S> briefly speaking , hyperbolicity means uniform expansion ( or contraction ) by the tangent map along the orbits and when restricted to particular invariant subbundles . </S>",
    "<S> a quintessential example is an anosov flow  @xcite .    by a weak form of hyperbolicity we mean uniformly contraction of the ratio between the dynamical behavior of the tangent map when computed in an invariant subbundle and the dynamical behavior of the tangent map restricted to another invariant subbundle which is most contracting ( or less expanding ) than the first mentioned .    </S>",
    "<S> later , in  @xcite , ma presented the guidelines for the proof of the aforementioned dichotomy in the surfaces case . </S>",
    "<S> however , it was necessary more ingredients and new tools to obtain a complete proof ( see the work of bochi  @xcite ) . then , in a remarkable paper  @xcite , bochi and viana extended the bochi - ma theorem to any dimensional manifolds and recently bochi ( see  @xcite ) was able to obtain the full statement announced in  @xcite for the symplectomorphisms setting .    for the flow setting the first author proved in  @xcite the three - dimensional version for vectors fields without equilibrium points and also a weak version for general divergence - free vector fields . </S>",
    "<S> later , in  ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * theorem a ) , a global version for vector fields with equilibrium points was obtained . in  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> was proved a version for linear differential systems with conservativeness properties and in  @xcite was obtained a similar result in the hamiltonians setting .    after the perturbation techniques developed in  @xcite and in  @xcite we expected to obtain bochi - viana s theorem for a @xmath0-dense subset of @xmath6 , however by an upgrade refinement on the perturbation framework we were able to obtain this result for a @xmath0-residual subset of @xmath6 , thus achieve the full counterpart of  ( </S>",
    "<S> * ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * theorem 2 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> more precisely we prove the following result .    </S>",
    "<S> [ t1 ] there exists @xmath0-residual set @xmath10 such that if @xmath11 then there exist two @xmath8-invariant subsets of @xmath1 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , whose union has full measure and such that :    * if @xmath14 then all the lyapunov exponents associated to @xmath15 are zero ; * if @xmath16 then its orbit admits a dominated splitting for the linear poincar flow .    </S>",
    "<S> we point out that the abundance of zero exponents from the generic point of view seems to be strongly related to the topology used , namely to the @xmath0-topology . on the other hand recent results obtained by viana ( @xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> show that , in a prevalent way , hlder continuous linear cocycles based on a uniformly hyperbolic system with local product structure have nonzero lyapunov exponents .    </S>",
    "<S> recall that @xmath9 is _ ergodic _ if any measurable @xmath8-invariant set is a zero measure set or is a full measure set . </S>",
    "<S> we say that @xmath9 is a @xmath0-_stably ergodic _ flow if there exists a @xmath0-neighborhood of @xmath7 such that any @xmath17 is ergodic .    </S>",
    "<S> let us denote by @xmath18 the space of the @xmath0-stably ergodic flows in @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we refer the reader to the survey of pugh and shub ( @xcite ) on properties of these systems . from theorem  [ t1 ] </S>",
    "<S> it follows that if @xmath19 then either the set @xmath12 has full measure or else @xmath13 is a full measure set . in the next result we prove that , for an open and dense subset of @xmath18 , actually @xmath12 has zero measure and the pointwise domination given by theorem  [ t1 ] for points in the full measure set @xmath13 is in fact uniform . </S>",
    "<S> this result is a ( strong ) continuous - time version of bochi - fayad - pujals theorem for conservative diffeomorphism ( @xcite ) .    </S>",

    "<S> next theorem shows that if a @xmath11 does not belong to the closure of those having elliptic closed orbits then it exhibits some kind of weak hyperbolicity . </S>",

    "<S> then , there exists a full measure set @xmath23 such that every orbit of @xmath24 admits a dominated splitting for the linear poincar flow .    as a consequence of the previous result </S>",
