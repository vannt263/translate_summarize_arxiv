    "an interest to the exotic systems which consist of antikaons and nucleons rose recently after the statement @xcite that deep and narrow quasi - bound states can exist in @xmath0 and @xmath9 systems . due to this several calculations of the quasi - bound state in the lightest @xmath0 system with @xmath10 quantum numbers , usually called @xmath2 , were performed . among all calculations",
    "those using faddeev - type equations are the most accurate ones .",
    "the first results of the two accurate calculations @xcite confirmed the fact of existence of the quasi - bound state in the @xmath2 , but the evaluated binding energies and widths are far different from the predicted in @xcite .",
    "the results of the two groups @xcite also differ between themselves , and the main reason for this is choice of the antikaon - nucleon interaction , being an input for the three - body calculations .",
    "it was demonstrated@xcite that the crucial role in the @xmath0 calculations plays the model of @xmath5 interaction , which is far more important than nucleon - nucleon one .",
    "but interaction of an antikaon with nucleon is known far less .",
    "therefore , the next step was construction of as accurate model of the interaction as possible .",
    "there is some experimental information about @xmath5 interaction , in particular , cross - sections of @xmath11 scattering were measured , their threshold branching ratios and shift and width of @xmath12 level of kaonic hydrogen ( which should be more accurately called `` antikaonic hydrogen '' ) .",
    "the last observable has quite interesting experimental history , while theoretical methods were limited to use approximate deser or `` corrected deser '' formulas , which connect @xmath12 level shift of an hadronic atom with scattering length , given by strong interaction in the pair .",
    "the question was how accurate are the approximate formulas , derived for the pion - nucleon interaction , for the antikaon - nucleon system .",
    "it was demonstrated @xcite that deser - type formulas has low accuracy for the antikaon - nucleon system .",
    "low accuracy of the `` corrected deser '' formula was late found in @xcite .",
    "another question of antikaon - nucleon interaction is the structure of the @xmath13 resonance , which is usually assumed as a quasi - bound state in the @xmath5 and a resonance in the connected to it @xmath14 channel .",
    "it was found in @xcite that a chirally motivated model of the interaction lead to the two - pole structure of the resonance . keeping all this in mind ,",
    "the new phenomenological @xmath5 potentials were constructed in @xcite . the @xmath12 level shift and width of kaonic hydrogen used for the fits of the interaction models were calculated directly , without using some approximate formulas .",
    "two potentials with one- and two - pole structure of the @xmath13 resonance were constructed and fitted to experimental data .",
    "it turned out @xcite that it is possible to construct potentials with one- and two - pole structure of the @xmath13 resonance which describe existing low - energy experimental data with the same level of accuracy . due to this",
    "the one- and two - pole @xmath5 potentials were used as an input in calculations of the low - energy elastic @xmath4 scattering @xcite .",
    "after publication of @xcite siddharta collaboration reported results of the last measurement of kaonic hydrogen characteristics @xcite , which turned out to be quite different from the previous results of dear experiment @xcite and compatible with older kek data @xcite . due to this , the potentials were refitted in such a way that they reproduce the most recent experimental data on kaonic hydrogen @xmath12 level shift and width and the calculations of low - energy elastic kaon - deuteron scattering were repeated in @xcite . in addition an approximate calculation of the @xmath12 level shift and width of kaonic deuterium was performed .",
    "it was done approximately using complex @xmath15 potential , reproducing elastic three - body amplitudes .",
    "it was found that neither on three - body level it is possible to resolve the question of the number of @xmath13 poles .",
    "therefore , the question of the number of poles is irrelevant . in order to support the statement ,",
    "one more , a chirally - motivated @xmath5 potential was additionally constructed , which , as that one in @xcite , has two poles forming @xmath13 .",
    "parameters of this model were also fitted to the low - energy experimental data on @xmath11 scattering and kaonic hydrogen .",
    "the chirally motivated potential reproduces all antikaon- nucleon data with the same accuracy as the two phenomenological models .",
    "another way of investigation of the @xmath13 resonance was suggested and realized in @xcite , were low - energy breakup of the @xmath4 system was considered .",
    "the resonance should be seen as a bump in so called deviation spectrum of neutrons in the final state of the reaction .",
    "however , @xmath13 is so broad that it was seen as a bump in some cases only .",
    "finally , the calculations of the three - body @xmath0 system with different quantum numbers using all three models of @xmath5 interaction were repeated in @xcite . in particular , binding energy and width of @xmath2 quasi - bound state were evaluated , low - energy @xmath4 amplitudes were calculated and @xmath12 level shift and width of kaonic deuterium were predicted .",
    "a search of a quasi - bound state in the @xmath4 system was also performed with negative results .    after the approximate calculations of the kaonic deuterium characteristics exact calculations were performed in @xcite .",
    "namely , a version of faddeev - type equations with strong plus coulomb interactions , suggested in @xcite , were solved .",
    "it was the first time , when the equations @xcite , initially written for a system with coulomb interaction being a correction to s strong potential , were used for investigations of an hadronic atom , where coulomb potential plays the main role .",
    "since the equations are much more complicated than `` usual '' ags ones ( for short - range potentials only ) , the calculations were performed using simple complex @xmath5 potentials , reproducing only some of the experimental @xmath11 data .",
    "comparison of the dynamically accurate three - body results with the previous approximate ones shown that the approximation of the kaonic deuterium as a two - body system is quite accurate for this task .",
    "another three - body exotic system with antikaons consists of two antikaons and one nucleon was studied in @xcite .",
    "it was expected that a quasi - bound state can exist in the system too .",
    "the three models of the @xmath5 interaction were used , while the @xmath7 potentials were constructed using some theoretical models .",
    "a quasi - bound state was found in the @xmath3 system with smaller binding energy and larger width then in the @xmath2 .",
    "it is interesting , that the parameters of the states allow to associate it with a @xmath16 state mentioned in the particle data group @xcite .",
    "the paper summarises results of the series of works  @xcite devoted to the topic .",
    "the next section is devoted to the two - body interactions , necessary for the three - body calculations .",
    "faddeev - type alt - grassberger - sandhas equations with coupled channels , which were used for three - body calculations with strong interactions , are described in section [ ags_sect ] .",
    "section [ qbs_sect ] is devoted to the quasi - bound states in the @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath3 systems .",
    "near - threshold @xmath17 scattering is considered in section [ kd_elastic_sect ] , the kaonic deuterium  in section [ kaonic_deu_sect ] .",
    "conclusions are given in the last section .",
    "in order to investigate some three - body system it is necessary to know interactions acting between all the pairs of the particles .",
    "the interactions necessary for investigation of the @xmath18 and @xmath1 systems are the follows : @xmath5 and @xmath6 with other channels coupled to them , and one - channel @xmath8 and @xmath7 interactions ( the remained ones were omitted in the three - body calculations ) . all potentials , except one @xmath8 potential , were specially constructed for the calculations .",
    "they have separable form and n - term structure @xmath19 which leads to the separable @xmath20-matrix @xmath21 @xmath22 in  ( [ v_nterm ] ) and  ( [ t_nterm ] ) is a number of terms of the separable potential , @xmath23 is a strength constant , while @xmath24 is a form - factor .",
    "the two - body isospins @xmath25 , @xmath26 in general are not conserved . in particular ,",
    "the two - body isospin is conserved in the phenomenological @xmath27 potentials , but the corresponding @xmath20-matrices do not conserve them due to coulomb interaction and physical masses , taken into account . the chirally motivated @xmath28 potential does not conserve the isospin itself due to its energy and mass dependence .",
    "antikaon - nucleon interaction is the most important interaction for the three - body systems under consideration .",
    "there are several models of the @xmath5 interaction , some of them are `` stand - alone '' ones having the only aim to fit experimental data , others were used in few- of many - body calculations .",
    "the problem is that the first ones are too complicated to be used in few - body calculations , while the second ones are too simple to reproduce all the experimental data properly . due to this , @xmath5 potentials , which are simple enough for using in faddeev - type three - body equations and at the same time reproduce all low - energy experimental data , were constructed .",
    "the resonance is a manifestation of the attractive nature of the antikaon - nucleon interaction , it couples @xmath5 to a lower @xmath14 channel .",
    "not only position and width , but the nature of the resonance itself are opened questions .",
    "a usual assumption is that @xmath13 is a resonance in @xmath14 and a quasi - bound state in @xmath5 channel .",
    "according to the most recent particle data group issue  @xcite the resonance has mass @xmath29 mev and width @xmath30 mev .",
    "there is also an assumption suggested in @xcite and supported by other chiral - based models , that the bump , which is usually understood as @xmath13 resonance , is an effect of two poles . due to this two different phenomenological models of antikaon - nucleon interaction , providing one- or two - pole structure of the @xmath13 ,",
    "were constructed .",
    "the third model is a chirally motivated potential , which has two poles by construction .",
    "extraction of the resonance parameters from experimental data is complicated for two reasons .",
    "first , it can not be studied in a two - body reaction and can be seen in a final state of some few- or many - body process .",
    "second , it s width is large , so the corresponding peak could be blurred .",
    "a theoretical paper  @xcite was devoted to the possibility of tracing the @xmath13 resonance in neutron spectrum of @xmath4 breakup reaction .",
    "the neutron spectra of the @xmath31 reaction were calculated in cm energy range @xmath32 mev .",
    "the three - body system with coupled @xmath0 and @xmath33 channels was studied using faddeev - type ags equations described in section  [ ags_sect ] with four phenomenological @xmath5 potentials with one- or two - pole structure of the @xmath13 .",
    "it was found that kinematic effects completely mask the peak corresponding to the @xmath13 resonance .",
    "therefore , comparison of eventual experimental data on the low - energy @xmath31 reaction with theoretical results hardly can give an answer to the question of the number of @xmath13 poles .",
    "later , similar calculations of the same process were performed for initial kaon momentum @xmath34  gev  @xcite .",
    "ags coupled - channel equations were solved as well using energy - dependent and -independent @xmath5 potentials .",
    "the authors predict a pronounced maximum in the double - differential cross section with a forward emitted neutron at @xmath14 invariant mass @xmath35 gev .",
    "however , applicability of the potentials , fitted to near - threshold data , and nonrelativistic faddeev equations for such high energies is quite doubtful .",
    "several arguments presented in support to the idea of the two - pole structure of the @xmath13 resonance were checked in  @xcite using one- and two - pole phenomenological models of the antikaon - nucleon interaction .",
    "one of them is a difference between charged @xmath14 cross - sections , which is seen in different experiments , e.g. in clas  @xcite .",
    "elasic @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 cross - sections were plotted to check the assumption , that the difference is caused by the two - pole structure .",
    "however , it turned out that the cross sections are different and their maxima are shifted one from each other for both one- and two - pole versions of the @xmath5 potential . therefore , the effect is not a proof of the two - pole structure , but a manifestation of an isospin nonconservation and difference in the background .",
    "another argument for two - pole structure comes from the fact , that the poles in a two - pole model are coupled to different channels .",
    "indeed , gradually switching off the coupling between @xmath5 and @xmath14 channels turns the upper pole into a real bound state in @xmath5 , while the lower one becomes a resonance in uncoupled @xmath14 channel ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , it was suggested , that the poles of a two - body model manifest themselves in different reactions , in particular , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 amplitudes should `` feel '' only one of the two poles .",
    "the hypothesis was also checked in  @xcite , and indeed , the real parts of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 amplitudes in @xmath42 state cross real axis at different energies .",
    "but it is true for both versions of the potential .",
    "this effect must be caused by different background contributions in the reactions .",
    "consequently , a proof of the two - pole structure of the @xmath40 interaction does not exist .",
    "three threshold branching ratios of @xmath11 scattering were measured rather accurately  @xcite @xmath43 since phenomenological @xmath5 potentials , used in the calculations , take the lowest @xmath44 channel into account indirectly , a new ratio @xmath45 @xmath46 which contains measured @xmath47 and @xmath48 and has an `` experimental '' value @xmath49 was constructed .",
    "in contrast to the branching ratios , elastic and inelastic total cross sections with @xmath11 in the initial state were measured not so accurately , see fig.[crosskp.fig ] .",
    "the most promising source of knowledge about @xmath5 interaction is kaonic hydrogen atom ( which correctly should be called ",
    "antikaonic hydrogen  ) .",
    "the atom has reach experimental history , several experiments measured it s @xmath12 level shift @xmath50 and width @xmath51 caused by strong @xmath5 interaction in comparison to pure coulomb case with quite different results .",
    "the most recent one was performed by siddharta collaboration  @xcite @xmath52 paradoxically , the directly measurable observables are not reproduced in the same way in the most of the theoretical works devoted to the antikaon - nucleon interaction . some approximate formula",
    "are used there for reproducing the @xmath12 level shift .",
    "the most popular is a `` corrected deser '' formula obtained in  @xcite , which connects the shift with the scattering length of @xmath11 system @xmath53 @xmath54.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the formula is one of quite a few improved versions of the original formula derived by deser for pion - nucleon system .",
    "it differs from the original one by the second term in the brackets .",
    "however , it was shown that for the antikaon - nucleon system it is not accurate .",
    "phenomenological models of antikaon - nucleon interaction with one- or two - pole structure of the @xmath13 resonance were constructed together with a chirally motivated one .",
    "they directly reproduce the @xmath12 level shift and width of kaonic hydrogen , measured by siddharta collaboration , without using approximate formulas .",
    "the potentials also reproduce experimental data on @xmath11 scattering and the threshold branching ratios , described in the previous subsection .",
    "all three potentials are suitable for using in accurate few - body equations .",
    "the potentials reproduce characteristics of kaonic hydrogen directly , therefore the problem of two particles interacting by strong and coulomb potentials was solved .",
    "the physical masses of the particles were used during the data fits , therefore , the two - body system does not conserve isospin .",
    "the method of solution of lippmann - schwinger equation for a system with coulomb plus separable strong potential is based on the fact that the full @xmath20-matrix of the problem can be written as a sum @xmath55 . here",
    "@xmath56 is the pure coulomb transition matrix and @xmath57 is the coulomb - modified strong @xmath20-matrix . for the present case it was necessary to extend the formalism in order to describe the system of coupled @xmath5 , @xmath14 , and @xmath44 ( for the chirally motivated potential ) channels .",

    "it is different from the phenomenological potentials situation since in that case the potentials conserve two - body isospin ( but not the corresponding @xmath20-matrices ) .",
    "another difference between the chirally motivated and the phenomenological potentials is that in the first case the form - factors @xmath93 depend on the two - body isospin . besides , they are dimensionless due to additional factor @xmath94 in the numerator .",

    "this version of the @xmath7 interaction was called  lattice motivated  .",
    "however , the models of the @xmath7 interaction described above can not be directly used in the ags equations . due to this the @xmath7 interaction",
    "was represented in form of a one - term separable potential with form factors given by @xmath144 the strength parameters @xmath23 , @xmath67 and range parameters @xmath145 were fixed by a fit to the @xmath7 phase shifts and scattering lengths of the  original  and the ` lattice motivated' models of the antikaon - antikaon interaction .",
    "the three - body faddeev equations in the alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) form  @xcite were used for the most of the three - body calculations .",
    "they were extended in order to take @xmath14 channel coupled to the @xmath5 subsystem directly . in practice",

    "this fact is taken into account when the three - body coupled - channel equations are antisymmetrized .",
    "all calculations were performed under or slightly above the @xmath0 threshold , so that orbital angular momentum of all two - body interactions was set to zero and , therefore , the total orbital angular momentum is also @xmath165 .",
    "in particular , the main @xmath5 potential was constructed with orbital angular momentum @xmath166 since the interaction is dominated by the @xmath80-wave @xmath13 resonance .",
    "the interaction of @xmath167-meson with the nucleon is weaker then the other interactions , therefore , it was omitted in the equations .",
    "information about @xmath6 interaction is very poor , and there is no reason to assume significant effect of higher partial waves .",
    "finally , @xmath8 interaction was also taken in @xmath166 state only since physical reasons for sufficient effect of higher partial waves in the present calculation are not seen .",
    "spin of the @xmath0 system is given by spin of the two baryons , which also defines the @xmath8 isospin due to symmetry properties .",
    "looking for the quasi - bound state in @xmath0 , the @xmath168 , @xmath169 state ( usually denoted as @xmath2 ) was chosen due to its connection to experiment .",
    "another possible configuration with @xmath168 , @xmath170 ( @xmath4 ) was also studied . as for the @xmath171 @xmath0 state",

    "the operator @xmath178 has symmetric @xmath8 isospin components , therefore , it has the correct symmetry properties for the @xmath2 system ( here and in what follows the right - hand indices of @xmath179 are omitted : @xmath180 ) .",
    "another operator , @xmath181 , has antisymmetric @xmath8 isospin components , so it drops out of the equations for the @xmath2 system , but remains in the equations describing @xmath4 system .",

    "the total spin of the @xmath183 system is equal to one half since the antikaon is a pseudoscalar meson . since all two - body interactions have zero orbital angular momentum , the total angular momentum @xmath184 is also equal to @xmath185 . as in the case of @xmath0 system ,",
    "the three - body @xmath1 system with the lowest possible value of the isospin @xmath186 was considered .",

    "similarly to the @xmath0 case , the transition operator @xmath187 already has the proper symmetry properties , while the remaining operators form pairs with proper symmetry properties .",
    "it is necessary to note that while coulomb potential was directly included in the two - body equations , used for fitting the antikaon - nucleon models of interaction , the three - body calculations were performed without it ( except the case of kaonic deuterium calculations , of cause ) .",
    "the reason is that the expected effect of its inclusion is small .",
    "in addition , the isospin averaged masses were used in all three - body calculations .",
    "accuracy of this approximation was checked in @xcite , it is quite high .",
    "it was shown in section [ v_kn_sect ] that the phenomenological @xmath5 potentials with one- and two - pole structure of the @xmath13 resonance and the chirally motivated antikaon - nucleon potential can reproduce near - threshold experimental data on @xmath11 scattering and kaonic hydrogen with equal accuracy .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to choose one of these models looking on the two - body sector only .",
    "due to this three - body calculations were performed using all three models of antikaon - nucleon interaction .",
    "the quasi - bound state in the @xmath2 system was the phenomenon which attracted the present interest to the antikaon - nucleus systems .",
    "additionally to being an interesting exotic physical object , the state could clarify still unanswered questions on the antikaon - nucleon interaction , in particular , the nature of the @xmath13 resonance .",
    "one more possible candidate for a strange three - body system with a quasibound state in it is @xmath1 .",
    "however , the strangeness @xmath182 system contains @xmath7 interaction , which is repulsive .",
    "the question was whether the repulsion is strong enough to overtake @xmath5 attraction and by this exclude the possibility of the quasibound state formation .",
    "the state of interest is a quasi - bound state ( a bound state with non - zero width ) for the higher ( for example @xmath0 ) channel and a resonance for the lower ( @xmath33 ) one .",
    "therefore , the pole corresponding to the state should be situated between the @xmath0 and @xmath33 thresholds on the physical energy sheet of the higher channel and on an unphysical sheet of the lower channel ( and similarly for the @xmath1 system ) .",
    "two methods of searching the complex pole position by solving the homogeneous system of equations were used .",
    "the first one is the direct pole search with contour rotation .",
    "the correct analytical continuation of the momentum space equations from the physical energy sheet to the proper unphysical one is achieved by moving the momentum integration into the complex plane .",
    "namely , the integration was performed along a ray in the fourth quadrant of the complex plane with some condition on the momentum variable .",
    "after that the position @xmath188 of a quasi - bound state was found by solving the equation @xmath189 , where @xmath190 is the determinant of the linear system , obtained after discretization of the integral equations corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ full_oper_eq ] ) .    another way of location a quasi - bound state , which avoids integration in the complex plane , was suggested and used in  @xcite .",
    "the idea is that every isolated and quite narrow resonance should manifest itself at real energies .",
    "usually resonances are seen in cross - sections of some reactions . in the case of three - body integral equations",
    "the function @xmath191 enters all possible amplitudes , described by the system of equations .",
    "therefore , instead of evaluation of some cross - sections , containing additional information about the particular processes , the function @xmath192 was calculated .",
    "the corresponding bump in the @xmath192 function calculated at real energy axes can be fitted to a breit - wigner curve with some background . in this way information on the resonance position and width can be obtained .    since",
    "direct search of the complex root is a difficult and non - trivial task , the breit - wigner values can serve as a good starting point for it . on the other hand , it is a test of the directly found pole position , which is free from the possible uncertainty of the proper choice of the riemann sheet .",
    "the first dynamically exact calculation of the quasi - bound state in the @xmath2 system was published in  @xcite , while the extended version of the results appeared in  @xcite .",
    "existence of the @xmath193 three - body quasi - bound state in the @xmath0 system predicted in @xcite was confirmed there , but the evaluated binding energy and width were strongly different .",
    "however , @xmath40 potentials used in @xcite do not reproduce experimental data on @xmath11 system as accurately , as those described in section [ v_kn_sect ] . due to this",
    "the calculations devoted to the @xmath2 system were repeated in @xcite .",
    "the one - pole @xmath58 , two - pole @xmath59 phenomenological potentials from  @xcite and the chirally motivated @xmath194 potential from  @xcite , described in section [ v_kn_sect ] were used as an input .",
    "the other two were the two - term tsa - b nn potential @xcite together with the spin - independent exact optical @xmath6 potential in isospin @xmath168 state and the one - channel @xmath195 in @xmath171 , see section [ nn_sign_sect ] .",
    "the results of the last calculations @xcite are shown in table  [ knn_poles.tab ] .",
    "first of all , comparison of the results obtained using direct pole search and @xmath192 method demonstrates that they are very close each to other for all three @xmath5 potentials .",
    "therefore , the suggested @xmath192 method of finding mass and width of a subthreshold resonance is efficient for the @xmath2 system , and the two methods support each another .",
    "ccccc & & + & @xmath196 & @xmath197 & @xmath196 & @xmath197 + @xmath198 & @xmath199 & @xmath200 & @xmath201 & @xmath202 + @xmath203 & @xmath204 & @xmath205 & @xmath206 & @xmath207 + @xmath208 & @xmath209 & @xmath210 & @xmath211 & @xmath212 +    another fact seen from the results in table  [ knn_poles.tab ] is strong dependence of the binding energy of the quasi - bound state @xmath196 and its width @xmath197 on the @xmath5 interaction models .",
    "it was already observed in @xcite , when older phenomenological antikaon - nucleon potentials were used . in particular , it is seen from table  [ knn_poles.tab ] that the quasi - bound states resulting from the phenomenological potentials lie about @xmath213 mev deeper , than those of the chirally motivated one .",
    "this probably is due to the energy dependence of chirally motivated model of the interaction .",
    "really , all three potentials were fitted to the experimental data near the @xmath5 threshold .",
    "when the @xmath2 quasi - bound state is calculated at lower energies , the phenomenological models of the @xmath5 interaction are unchanged . as for the chirally motivated potential ,",
    "its energy dependence reduces the attraction at the lower energies in the @xmath0 quasi - bound state region , thus producing states with less binding .",
    "widths of the three quasi - bound states are also different : those of the two - pole models of @xmath5 interaction are almost coinciding , while the width evaluated using the one - pole @xmath198 potential is much larger .",
    "it is seen from table  [ phys_char.tab ] that the potentials with the two - pole @xmath13 have very close positions of the higher poles , while the pole of the one - pole potential is different .",
    "therefore , the difference in widths might be connected with the different pole structure of the corresponding @xmath5 interaction models .",
    "importance of the proper inclusion of the second @xmath33 channel in the calculations was first demonstrated in  @xcite .",
    "a simple complex version of the coupled - channel version @xmath40 potentials , described in section [ v_kn_sect ] , was used in  @xcite together with the full version .",
    "this allowed to check importance of the second channel .",
    "comparison of the result of the one - channel complex @xmath0 @xmath214 calculation with the coupled - channel one @xmath215 ( see table iv of  @xcite ) shows that @xmath215 is much deeper and broader than @xmath214 .",
    "this means that the @xmath14 channel within a genuinely three - body coupled - channel calculation plays an important dynamical role in forming the three - body quasi - bound state , over its obvious role of absorbing flux from the @xmath5 channel .",
    "thus , proper inclusion of the second @xmath14 channel is crucial for the @xmath0 system .",
    "it was found later in  @xcite that use of an exact optical @xmath5 potential can serve an alternate way of direct inclusion of the second @xmath14 channel .",
    "an accuracy of use of the exact optical @xmath5 potential , which gives exactly the same on- and off - shell elastic @xmath5 amplitude as the original potential with coupled channels , in one - channel ags calculations for the three actual @xmath5 potentials was checked .",
    "the `` exact optical '' binding energies differ only slightly from the full coupled - channel results from table  [ knn_poles.tab ] , while the widths gain more visible error : @xmath216 however , the difference in widths is not dramatic , so that the one - channel faddeev calculation with exact optical potential could be quite satisfactory approximation to the full calculation with coupled channels .",
    "the three binding energy @xmath196 and width @xmath197 values of the @xmath2 quasi - bound state shown in table [ knn_poles.tab ] can be compared with other theoretical results worth mentioning .",
    "those are : the original prediction of the deep and narrow quasi - bound @xmath2 state  @xcite , the results obtained in the earlier faddeev calculation  @xcite , the most recent results of alternative calculation using the same equations with different input  @xcite and two variational results  @xcite .",
    "only calculations presented in  @xcite together with the earlier ones  @xcite were performed with directly included second @xmath33 channel .",
    "all others take it into account approximately .",
    "the second problem is that none of the @xmath5 potentials , used in that @xmath2 calculations , reproduce data on near - threshold @xmath11 scattering with the same level of accuracy as those described in section  [ v_kn_sect ] .",
    "in addition , none of them reproduce @xmath12 level shift of kaonic hydrogen directly .",
    "the quasi - bound binding energy and width were obtained in  @xcite from a g - matrix calculation .",
    "the one - channel simple complex @xmath5 potential used in those calculations does not reproduce actual @xmath11 experimental data . finally , the most problematic factor of  @xcite is taking into account one @xmath0 channel only .",
    "in a funny way all defects of the calculation presented in  @xcite led to the binding energy ( @xmath217 mev ) and width ( @xmath218 mev ) , which are quite close to those from the exact coupled - channel results from table  [ knn_poles.tab ] obtained with the two - pole and one - pole phenomenological potentials , respectively .    the earlier result for the binding energy @xmath219 mev",
    "@xcite is very close to the actual one from table  [ knn_poles.tab ] calculated with one - pole phenomenological @xmath40 potential .",
    "in fact , in both cases the same three - body equations with coupled @xmath0 and @xmath33 channels were solved .",
    "in addition , the same model of antikaon - nucleon interaction was used but with different sets of parameters .",
    "this difference influenced the width of the quasi - bound state : the older one @xmath220 mev is much larger .",
    "coupled - channel ags equations were also solved in  @xcite with chirally motivated energy dependent and independent @xmath5 potentials .",
    "therefore , in principle , those results obtained with the energy dependent version of the @xmath5 potential @xmath221 should give a result , which is close to those from table  [ knn_poles.tab ] with chirally motivated model of interaction @xmath208 .",
    "however , only those width ( @xmath222 mev ) is comparable to the @xmath223 , while the binding energy obtained in  @xcite ( @xmath224 mev ) is much smaller than the actual one from table  [ knn_poles.tab ] .",
    "the situation is opposite when the actual results are compared with those obtained in @xcite using energy independent antikaon - nucleon potential .",
    "namely , binding energies reported in that paper ( @xmath225 mev ) are comparable with those from table  [ knn_poles.tab ] evaluated using phenomenological @xmath226 and @xmath227 potentials , however , their widths @xmath228 mev are much smaller .",
    "the authors of @xcite neglect @xmath6 interaction in their calculations .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that while the three - body @xmath2 pole position strongly depends on the @xmath40 interaction , dependence on @xmath6 is weak .",
    "some visible effect manifests itself only when the interaction is switched off completely , like in the case of @xcite .",
    "more serious reason of the difference in the case of chirally motivated antikaon - nucleon model of interaction is an approximation used in the chirally motivated models used in @xcite .",
    "namely , the energy - dependent square root factors , responsible for the correct normalization of the amplitudes , are replaced by constant masses",
    ". this can be reasonable for the highest @xmath5 channel , however , it is certainly a poor approximation for the lower lying @xmath14 and @xmath44 channels .",
    "the role of this approximation in the ags calculations was checked in @xcite .",
    "the approximate binding energy @xmath229 mev is really much smaller than the original one @xmath230 mev presented in table  [ knn_poles.tab ] .",
    "the remaining difference between the results from table [ knn_poles.tab ] and those from @xcite could be explained by the lower accuracy of reproducing experimental @xmath11 data by the @xmath5 potentials from @xcite .    finally , no second pole in the @xmath2 system reported in  @xcite was found in @xcite .",
    "the search was performed with all three @xmath5 potentials in the corresponding energy region ( binding energy @xmath231 mev and width @xmath232 mev ) .",
    "variational calculations , performed by two groups , reported the results which are very close to those obtained in  @xcite with the energy - dependent potential : @xmath233 mev , @xmath234 mev in  @xcite and @xmath235 mev , @xmath236 mev in  @xcite .    however , there are a few problematic points in  @xcite .",
    "first of all , the variational calculations were performed solely in the @xmath0 sector .",
    "the authors of the variational calculations  @xcite used a one - channel @xmath5 potential , derived from a chirally motivated model of interaction with many couped channels .",
    "however , the potential is not `` the exact optical '' one .",
    "in fact , it is not clear , how this one - channel potential is connected to the original one and whether it still reproduces some experimental @xmath11 data .",
    "moreover , the position of the quasi - bound state was determined in  @xcite only from the real part of this complex @xmath5 potential , as a real bound state , while the width was estimated as the expectation value of the imaginary part of the potential .",
    "this , essentially perturbative treatment of the inelasticity might be justified for quite narrow resonances , but the quasi - bound state under consideration is certainly not of this type .",
    "another serious problem of the variational calculations is their method of treatment of the energy dependence of the @xmath5 potential in the few - body calculations .",
    "it was already shown in the previous subsection that the energy dependence of the chirally motivated model of @xmath237 interaction has a crucial effect on the @xmath2 quasi - bound state position .",
    "the question of usage of an energy - dependent @xmath5 potential in a few - body calculation was considered in some detail in section iv of  @xcite .",
    "while momentum space faddeev integral equations allow an exact treatment of this energy dependence , coordinate space variational methods can use only energy independent interactions . due to this a series of calculations",
    "was performed in @xcite with differently fixed two - particle @xmath5 energies @xmath238 in the couplings of the chirally motivated interaction .",
    "the conclusion was , that the method used in  @xcite is unable to define an `` averaged '' @xmath238 , for which the fixed - energy chirally motivated interaction , even in a correct three - body calculation , can yield a correct @xmath2 quasi - bound state position .",
    "first , the calculations of @xcite show , that a real @xmath238 has absolutely no chance to reproduce or reasonably approximate the exact quasi - bound state position , even with correct treatment of the imaginary part of the interaction , unlike in  @xcite .",
    "second , the way , how the `` self - consistent '' value of ( generally complex ) @xmath238 is defined in the papers does not seem to guarantee , that the correct value will be reached or at least approximated . in view of the above considerations ,",
    "the results of  @xcite can be considered as rough estimates of what a really energy dependent @xmath5 interaction will produce in the @xmath2 system .",
    "after publication of the exact results  @xcite one more paper on the @xmath239 system appeared @xcite .",
    "hyperspherical harmonics in the momentum representation and faddeev equations in configuration space were used .",
    "however , the authors collected all defects of other approximate calculations .",
    "in particular , they used simple complex antikaon - nucleon potentials and , therefore , neglected proper inclusion of the @xmath33 channel , which is crucial for the system .",
    "in addition , accuracy of experimental @xmath11 data reproduction by the @xmath5 potentials is low since the old potentials from @xcite were used there . keeping all this in mind",
    ", the results of @xcite hardly can be reliable .",
    "strongly attractive isospin - zero part of the @xmath5 potential plays less important role in the spin - one state of the @xmath0 system called @xmath4 than in the spin - zero @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , if a quasi - bound state exists in @xmath17 it should have smaller binding energy than in @xmath2 .",
    "the faddeev calculations of the @xmath4 scattering length @xmath240 , described in section  [ kd_elastic_sect ] , gave some evidence that such a state could exists  @xcite .",
    "a simple analytical continuation of the effective range formula below the @xmath4 threshold suggests a @xmath4 quasi - bound state with binding energy @xmath241 mev ( were the energy is measured from the @xmath4 threshold ) and width @xmath242 mev for the three antikaon - nucleon potentials from section  [ v_kn_sect ] .    however , a systematic search for these states , performed in @xcite with the same two - body input as for the @xmath2 system , did not find the corresponding poles nowhere in the complex plane of energy with real part situated between the @xmath33 and @xmath4 thresholds .",
    "the reason of discrepancy between effective range estimation and the direct calculations must be the validity of the effective range formula , which is limited to the vicinity of the corresponding threshold .",
    "since the @xmath4 state is expected to have , similarly to @xmath2 , rather large width , it is definitely out of such a region .",
    "it was demonstrated in  @xcite that increasing of the attraction in isospin - zero @xmath5 subsystem by hands ( when phenomenological antikaon - nucleon potentials are used ) leads to appearing of @xmath4 quasi - bound states .",
    "the calculations of the quasi - bound state in the @xmath1 system were performed with the two @xmath7 interactions described in section  [ v_kk_sect ] ( original @xmath243 and lattice - motivated @xmath244 ) and three @xmath5 potentials from section  [ v_kn_sect ] : the phenomenological one - pole @xmath198 and two - pole @xmath203 potentials , together with the chirally - motivated @xmath194 .",
    "the results are presented in table [ kkn_poles.tab ] .",
    "it turned out that all combinations of the two - body interactions lead to a quasi - bound state in the @xmath1 three - body system .",
    "therefore , the quasi - bound state exists in the strangeness @xmath182 system in spite of the repulsive character of the @xmath7 interaction .",
    "its binding energy and width are in the region @xmath245 mev and @xmath246 mev , respectively .",
    "therefore , the quasi - bound state in the strangeness @xmath182 @xmath1 system is much shallower and broader than the one in the @xmath164 @xmath2 system , when comparing calculations with the same @xmath5 potential .",

    "the reason is the larger widths of the  phenomenological ",
    "@xmath1 states , which means that the connection between the pole positions and characteristics of the the breit - wigner bumps is less pronounced .",
    "the found @xmath1 quasi - bound state has the same quantum numbers as a @xmath16 baryon with @xmath273 .",
    "the available experimental information on the @xmath16 spectrum is rather limited , see pdg @xcite .",

    "it is known , that original one - channel integral faddeev equations have moving logarithmic singularities in the kernels when scattering above a three - body breakup threshold is considered .",
    "the @xmath4 amplitudes were calculated from zero up to the three - body @xmath0 breakup threshold , so , in principle , the equations could be free of the singularities .",
    "however , the lower @xmath33 channel is opened when @xmath4 scattering is considered , which causes appearance of logarithmic singularities even below the @xmath0 three - body breakup threshold .",

    "it means that it is not possible to resolve the question of the number of the poles forming the @xmath13 resonance from the results on near - threshold elastic @xmath4 scattering .",

    "the three - body observables obtained with the three @xmath5 potentials turned out to be very different each from other .",

    ", both simple complex @xmath5 potentials led to very inaccurate three - body results .",
    "therefore , one - channel faddeev - type calculation with a simple complex antikaon - nucleon potential is not a good approximation for the low - energy elastic @xmath4 scattering .",
    "one more approximate method used for the @xmath240 calculations is so - called `` fixed center approximation to faddeev equations '' ( fca ) , introduced in  @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is a variant of fsa or a two - center formula .",

    "the motion of the heavy particles is subsequently taken into account by averaging the obtained projectile - target amplitude over the bound state wave function of the target .",
    "the approximation is well known and works properly in atomic physics , where an electron is really much lighter than a nucleon or an ion .",
    "having in mind , that the antikaon mass is just a half of the mass of a nucleon , it is expected , that fsa hardly can be a good approximation for the @xmath4 scattering length calculation .",

    "the accuracy of the fca was checked in @xcite using the same input as in the ags equations in order to make the comparison as adequate as possible .",
    "first of all , the scattering lengths provided by the coupled - channel @xmath40 potentials together with the deuteron wave function corresponding to the tsa - b @xmath8 potential were used in fca formula .",
    "second , all @xmath291 parts were removed from the formula because they drop off the ags system of equations after antisymmetrization . finally , the fact , that the fca formula was obtained for a local @xmath5 potential , while separable @xmath40 potentials were used in the faddeev equations , was took into account , and the corresponding changes in the fca formula were made .",
    "the results of using the fca formula without isospin - breaking effects stays far away from the full calculation , as is seen in fig.11 of @xcite . while errors for the imaginary part are not so large , the module of the real part is underestimated by about @xmath292 .",
    "therefore , the calculations performed in @xcite show , that fca is a poor approximation for @xmath4 scattering length calculation .",
    "it is also seen from the figure that the accuracy is lower for the two - pole @xmath5 model of interaction ( note that all the chirally - based models of @xmath5 interaction have two - pole structure ) .",
    "therefore , among the approximate results fca was demonstrated to be the least accurate approximation , especially in reproducing of the real part of the @xmath4 scattering length . on the contrary , the one - channel ags calculation with exact optical @xmath293 potential gives the best approximation to the full coupled - channel result .",
    "all approximations are less accurate for the two - pole phenomenological model of @xmath40 interaction",
    ".    calculations of the @xmath4 scattering length using faddeev equations were also performed in  @xcite , while fca method was used in  @xcite .",
    "four @xmath240 values obtained in other faddeev calculations are shown in table 3 of @xcite together with the results shown in table [ kd_areff_egam.tab ] .",
    "the result of the very recent calculation with coupled channels  @xcite has real part of @xmath240 , which almost coincides with the present result for chirally motivated potential .",
    "the imaginary part of the @xmath4 scattering length from  @xcite is slightly larger .",
    "it might be caused by the fact that the model of @xmath5 interaction used there was fitted to kaonic hydrogen data not directly , but through the @xmath11 scattering length and the approximate formula , which is the least reliable in reproducing namely the imaginary part of the level shift .",
    "two old @xmath240 values  @xcite obtained within coupled - channel faddeev approach significantly underestimate the imaginary part of the @xmath4 scattering length , while their real parts are rather close to those in table  [ kd_areff_egam.tab ] .",
    "one more result of faddeev calculation  @xcite lies far away from all the others .",
    "one of the reasons is that the scattering length @xmath240 was obtained in  @xcite from one - channel faddeev equations with a complex potential .",
    "however , the underestimation of the absolute values of its real part in comparison to other faddeev calculations is so large , that it can not be explained by the method only .",
    "one more reason of the difference is the @xmath5 potential used in the paper .",
    "it gives very large mass of the @xmath11 quasibound state ( @xmath294 mev ) , which , therefore , is situated above the @xmath11 threshold .",

    "they are shown in fig.10 of @xcite , where the result of  @xcite calculated in isospin basis is plotted . however",
    ", even the original fca formula does not give such a large @xmath4 scattering length as @xmath240 from  @xcite , which , therefore , is additionally caused by too large @xmath5 scattering lengths , used there .",
    "as for the result of @xcite , it was obtained by simple applying of two approximate formulae : fca and the corrected deser formula , used for calculation of the @xmath5 scattering lengths , entering the fca .",
    "one of the representative @xmath240 values from  @xcite , having the largest possible imaginary part , is shown in fig .",
    "10 of @xcite .",
    "the values of  @xcite suffer from cumulative errors of two approximations and additional using of dear results on kaonic hydrogen @xmath12 level shift and width .",
    "really , it was shown in @xcite that the error of the corrected deser formula makes about @xmath295 for two - body case .",
    "the problems with dear experimental data were demonstrated in @xcite and in other theoretical works .",
    "the shift of the @xmath12 level in the kaonic deuterium ( which , strictly speaking , is an `` antikaonic '' deuterium ) and its width are caused by the presence of the strong interactions in addition to the coulomb one .",
    "it is a directly measurable value , which is free of a few uncertainties connected with an experiment on the @xmath2 quasi - bound state .",
    "however , from theoretical point of view it is harder task due to necessity to take coulomb potential into account directly together with the strong ones .",
    "there are two powerful ways to solve three - body problems accurately : solution of faddeev equations or use of variational methods .",
    "however , for the case of hadronic atom both methods face serious difficulties .",
    "the problem of the long range coulomb force exists in the faddeev approach , while variational methods suffer from the presence of two very different distance scales , which both are relevant for the calculations .    due to this at the first step",
    "the @xmath12 level energy of kaonic deuterium was calculated approximately using a two - body model of the atom . at the next step a method for simultaneous treatment of short range plus coulomb forces in three - body problems based on faddeev equations  @xcite",
    "was used , and the lowest level of kaonic deuterium was calculated dynamically exactly .",
    "the approximate calculation of the kaonic deuterium was performed assuming that atom can be considered as a two - body system consisting of a point - like deuteron , interacting with an antikaon through the complex @xmath15 potential .",
    "it means that the size of deuteron was taken into account only effectively through the potential , which reproduces the three - body @xmath4 ags amplitudes , evaluated before . keeping in mind relative values of deuteron and bohr radius of kaonic deuterium ,",
    "the approximation seemed well grounded .",
    "thus , a complex two - body @xmath15 potential was constructed and used for investigation of kaonic deuterium by lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "the two - term form of the potential @xmath296 was chosen with yamaguchi form - factors @xmath297    the complex strength parameters @xmath298 and @xmath299 were fixed by the conditions , that the @xmath300 potential reproduces the @xmath4 scattering length @xmath240 and the effective range @xmath281 obtained with one of the @xmath40 potentials and presented in table [ kd_areff_egam.tab ] .",
    "variation of the real @xmath301 and @xmath302 parameters allowed to reproduce the full near - threshold amplitudes from @xcite more accurately . as a result , the near - threshold amplitudes obtained from the three - body calculations @xmath303 are reproduced by the two - body @xmath15 potentials through the interval @xmath304 $ ] with such accuracy , that the two - body functions @xmath305 are indistinguishable from the three - body @xmath306 in fig.3 of  @xcite and in fig.5 of  @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the potentials are shown in table 3 of  @xcite and in eqs.(18,19 ) of  @xcite . both @xmath301 and @xmath302 parameters for every potential turned up to be much smaller then the corresponding @xmath307 parameter , as it can be expected having in mind the size of the deuteron .",
    "the constructed two - body complex potentials @xmath300 were used in the lippmann - schwinger equation .",

    "it is seen that the `` chirally motivated '' absolute values of the level shift @xmath318 and the width @xmath319 are both slightly larger than those obtained using the phenomenological @xmath40 potentials .",
    "however , all three results do not differ one from the other more than several percents .",
    "it is similar to the case of @xmath4 scattering length calculations , which turned out to be very close for the three @xmath5 potentials .",
    "the important point here is the fact that all three @xmath5 potentials reproduce low - energy experimental data on @xmath11 scattering and kaonic hydrogen with the same level of accuracy .",
    "it is also important that @xmath12 level of kaonic deuterium is situated not far from the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "the closeness of the results for kaonic deuterium means that comparison of the theoretical predictions with eventual experimental results hardly could choose one of the models of the @xmath5 interaction , especially taking into account the large widths @xmath309 .",
    "therefore , it could not be possible to say , whether the potential of antikaon - nucleon interaction should have one- or two - pole structure of the @xmath13 resonance and whether the potential should be energy dependent or not .",
    "in fact , it is seen from tables  [ phys_char.tab ] and [ kd_areff_egam.tab ] that there is no correlation between the pole or poles of the @xmath13 resonance described by a @xmath320 potential and the three - body @xmath4 elastic scattering or kaonic deuterium characteristics obtained using the potential .",
    "since some authors use the corrected deser formula eq.([cordes ] ) , which was shown to be inaccurate for the @xmath11 two - body system , for kaonic deuterium , accuracy of the formula was checked for this three - body system .",
    "the result obtained using the @xmath240 values from table  [ kd_areff_egam.tab ] are shown in fig.4 of @xcite and in eq.(20 ) of @xcite .",
    "being compared to the @xmath321 and @xmath322 from the same table [ kd_areff_egam.tab ] , the `` corrected deser '' results show large error for all three versions of the antikaon - nucleon interaction .",
    "while difference for the shift is not so drastic , the width of the @xmath12 level of kaonic deuterium is underestimated by the corrected deser formula by @xmath323 .    the @xmath12 level shift and width presented in table [ kd_areff_egam.tab ]",
    "are not exact , they were evaluated using the two - body approximation , which , however , it is well - grounded .",
    "information on the three - body strong part is taken into account indirectly through the @xmath15 potential , reproducing three - body elastic @xmath4 amplitudes . on the contrary",
    ", the corrected deser formula contains no three - body information at all since the only input is a @xmath4 scattering length ( a complex number ) .",
    "moreover , the formula relies on further approximations , which are absent in the accurate approximate calculations .",
    "some years ago a method for simultaneous treatment of short range plus coulomb forces in three - body problems , based on faddeev equations , was proposed  @xcite .",
    "the method was successfully applied for purely coulomb systems with attraction and repulsion and for the short range plus repulsive coulomb forces .",
    "the case of an hadronic atom with three strongly interacting particles and coulomb attraction between certain pairs was not considered before .",
    "the basic idea of the method was to transform the faddeev integral equations into matrix form using a special discrete and complete set of coulomb sturmian functions as a basis .",
    "coulomb sturmian functions in coordinate space are orthogonal with the weight function @xmath324 , that so they form a bi - orthogonal and complete set with their counter - parts . the most remarkable feature of this particular set is , that in this representation the matrix of the two - body @xmath325 operator , where @xmath326 is an energy and @xmath327 is the pure two - body coulomb hamiltonian , is tridiagonal .",
    "when this property is used for evaluation of the matrix elements of the two - body coulomb green s function @xmath328 , an infinite tridiagonal set of equations , which can be solved exactly , is obtained .",

    "the system of equations with coulomb interaction was solved in @xcite for kaonic deuterium .",
    "this calculation strongly differ from all other three - body calculations , described before .",
    "already the initial form of the faddeev equations for the kaonic deuterium @xmath12 level calculations differ from those for the pure strong interactions , described in section  [ ags_sect ] .",
    "first , the equations should be written in coordinate space , while ags equations were written in momentum space .",
    "second , since coulomb interaction acts between @xmath330 and the proton , particle basis was used and not isospin one . finally , the faddeev equations with coulomb define not transition operators as e.g. those in eq.([u_coupled ] ) , but wave functions .",
    "the equations are written in the noble form  @xcite , when the coulomb interaction appears in the green s functions .",
    "as usual for equations of faddeev type , the total three - body wave function is separated into three components : there are three partition channels @xmath331 , @xmath332 , @xmath333 and three sets of jacobi coordinates .",
    "the system of homogeneous equations to be solved contains the matrix elements of the overlap matrix between basis functions from different jacobi coordinate sets and of the strong potentials .",
    "they all can be calculated directly .",
    "the remaining parts of the kernel are matrix elements of the three - body partition green s functions @xmath334 .",
    "they are the basic quantities of the method , and their calculation depends on the partition channel .    for the @xmath332 channel the partition green s function",
    "@xmath335 contains coulomb interaction in its `` natural '' coordinate .",
    "it describes the @xmath336 subsystem and the neutron , which do not interact between themselves . due to this @xmath335",
    "can be calculated taking a convolution integral along a suitable contour in the complex energy plane over two two - body green functions . as for the matrix elements of the two - body green functions",
    ", they can be calculated using the properties of the coulomb sturmian basis and solving a resolvent equation .",
    "the situation with the remaining @xmath334 functions is more complicated . in the case of the channels with @xmath331 and",
    "@xmath333 the coulomb interaction is written not in its `` natural '' coordinates .",
    "due to this it is necessary to rewrite it as a sum of the coulomb potential in the natural coordinates plus a short range potential @xmath337 , called `` polarization potential '' .",
    "the three - body green function @xmath338 containing coulomb potential in natural for the channel coordinates is called the channel green function , and it is evaluated similarly to the previous @xmath339 case .",
    "namely , since the function describes a two - body subsystem and non - interacting with it third particle , the @xmath340 and @xmath341 can be found by taking a convolution integral with two two - body green s functions . at the last step the @xmath334 function",
    "is found from the equation containing the obtained channel green function @xmath338 and the polarization potential @xmath337 @xmath342    it was also necessary to take into account isospin dependence of the @xmath5 interaction . in particle representation it means that the strong @xmath343 potential is a @xmath344 matrix , containing @xmath345 , @xmath346 and @xmath347 elements . due to this",
    "the final equations for the kaonic deuterium system have four faddeev components , including the additional one in the @xmath348 channel .",
    "the solution of the faddeev - type equations gave the full energy of the @xmath12 level .",
    "since the aim of @xcite was evaluation of the @xmath12 level shift of kaonic deuterium caused by strong interaction between the antikaon and the nucleons , it was necessary not only calculate the energy of the @xmath12 level , but also define the energy , from which the real part of the shift is measured . for the last the lowest eigenvalue of either the channel green function or of the `` original '' green function of the @xmath349 channel can be chosen .",
    "the first one corresponds to a deuteron and an antikaon feeling a coulomb force from the center of mass of the deuteron .",
    "the second reflects the fact that the antikaon interacts via coulomb force not with the center of the deuteron , but with the proton . in principle",

    "the corrected deser formula eq.([cordes ] ) leads to @xmath386 error in the shift , and strongly , up to @xmath387 , underestimates the width .",
    "it is also possible to compare approximate results obtained in @xcite with the four complex @xmath5 potentials and in @xcite with the coupled - channel models of antikaon - nucleon interaction .",
    "it is seen that the ` complex one - channel' absolute values of the @xmath12 level shift and width shown in table  [ kd_shiftexact.tab ] are smaller than the ` coupled - channel' ones presented in table [ kd_areff_egam.tab ] .",
    "similar situation was observed with the exactly evaluated characteristics of the strong pole in the @xmath2 system , while a one - channel simple complex antikaon - nucleon potential led to more narrow and less bound quasi - bound state than the coupled - channel version ( see table iv of  @xcite ) .",
    "the very recent calculations  @xcite of the kaonic deuterium @xmath12 level shift were performed using the same faddeev - type equations with coulomb interaction as in @xcite , but with energy - dependent @xmath5 potentials .",
    "namely , the exact optical versions of the one- and two - pole phenomenological @xmath40 potentials and of the chirally motivated @xmath388 interaction model were used .",
    "the predicted @xmath12 level shifts ( @xmath389 ev ) and widths ( @xmath390 ev ) are larger by absolute value then those from table  [ kd_shiftexact.tab ] evaluated with the simple complex antikaon nucleon potentials .",
    "keeping in mind good accuracy of the results obtained with the exact optical @xmath5 potentials for all three - body @xmath0 observables , demonstrated in the present paper , the predictions of @xcite for the kaonic deuterium must be the most accurate ones up to date .",
    "the two - body approximation used in @xcite , being compared to the more accurate approach of @xcite , gives very accurate value of the @xmath12 level shift ( the error is @xmath384 ) , while the error for the width is larger ( @xmath391 ) .",
    "different characteristics of strangeness @xmath164 @xmath0 and @xmath182 @xmath1 systems were exactly calculated .",
    "phenomenological @xmath27 potentials with one and two - pole structure of the @xmath13 resonance together with the chirally motivated @xmath28 potential , constructed and used for the three - body calculations , allowed to investigate influence of the @xmath5 model on the results .",
    "all three potentials reproduce low - energy experimental data on @xmath11 scattering and kaonic hydrogen with equally high accuracy .",
    "dynamically exact three - body faddeev - type ags equations were solved for investigation quasi - bound states in @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath3 systems .",
    "the version of faddeev equations with coulomb interaction was used for the first exact calculation of the @xmath12 level of kaonic deuterium .",
    "quasi - bound states were predicted in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 systems , no quasi - bound state caused by strong interactions was found in the @xmath4 .",
    "the scattering lengths of @xmath4 system , the effective range and elastic near - threshold @xmath4 amplitudes were evaluated . the @xmath12 level shift and width of kaonic deuterium",
    "were predicted using accurate two - body approximation and exact faddeev - type calculation with coulomb interaction .",
    "it was found that while the quasi - bound state position strongly depends on the model of @xmath5 interaction , the near - threshold observables ( @xmath17 scattering length , @xmath12 level shift and width of kaonic deuterium ) are almost insensitive to it .",
    "therefore , some conclusions on the number of poles of the @xmath13 resonance could be done only if a hight accuracy measurement of @xmath2 binding energy and width will be done .",
    "it was shown that all three - body results weakly depend on the @xmath8 and @xmath6 interactions .",
    "several approximations were checked .",
    "it was demonstrated that the one - channel faddeev calculations with the exact optical @xmath5 potential give quite accurate results , while the one - channel results obtained with simple complex antikaon - nucleon potentials have large errors .",
    "fca approach used for the @xmath4 system is also very inaccurate .",
    "the corrected deser formula gives @xmath392 error for the @xmath11 system and @xmath323 for the @xmath4 . on the contrary ,",
    "the two - body approximation for the investigation of kaonic deuterium with exact solution of the lippmann - schwinger equation was shown to be quite accurate .",
    "the next step in the field of the few - body systems consisting of antikaons and nucleons should be done toward the four body systems .",
    "they give more possibilities , but are much harder for theoretical studies .",
