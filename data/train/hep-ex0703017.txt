    "[ fig : btodpenguin ] ) .",
    "these decays are suppressed in the standard model ( sm ) , with branching fractions at the @xmath9 level .",
    "assuming top - quark dominance in the virtual loop  @xcite , the direct and mixing - induced @xmath3 asymmetries are expected to vanish in these modes .",
    "however , contributions from up and charm quarks as well as from non - sm particles could induce sizeable cp asymmetries  @xcite .",
    "these modes are thus analogous to the @xmath10 decays in the measurement of virtual effects of contributions from non - sm phenomena  @xcite .",
    "additional amplitudes could affect @xmath11 penguin decays differently from @xmath12 penguin decays .",
    "in addition , various relations between branching fractions and cp asymmetries in these modes provide a test of sm predictions  @xcite .",
    "finally , the @xmath6 decay has an annihilation contribution in the sm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : btodpenguin ] ) .",
    "thus , the difference in decay rate between the charged mode and the neutral mode can be used to constrain the effect of this amplitude in @xmath2 decays .",
    "signal decays are separated from background decays using unbinned extended maximum likelihood fitting to distributions of kinematic and event - shape variables . the primary kinematic variables used to identify a reconstructed signal @xmath2 candidate are the difference between its reconstructed energy in the center - of - mass ( cm ) frame and the beam energy ; and a beam - energy substituted mass , @xmath13 , where the @xmath2-candidate momentum @xmath14 and the four - momentum of the initial @xmath15 state @xmath16 are calculated in the laboratory frame .",
    "event - shape variables are used to suppress the dominant `` continuum '' @xmath17 @xmath18 background further , exploiting angular differences between the jet - like topology of continuum decays and the isotropically distributed decays of @xmath19 events .",

    "the amplitude @xmath29 describes @xmath3 violation in the interference between mixed and unmixed decays into the same final state , while @xmath30 describes direct @xmath3 violation in decay .",
    "the time - dependent distribution is corrected for detector resolution effects and for mistag rates in the flavor identification of the other @xmath2 in the event .",
    "@xmath5 decays are reconstructed in the @xmath31 and @xmath32 sub - decay modes . as the @xmath33 meson has a relatively long lifetime of @xmath34 ps",
    ", its decay vertex is separated from the @xmath2 decay vertex by a few centimeters , which complicates the measurement of the @xmath35 position of the signal @xmath2 in the absence of prompt charged tracks originating from its decay vertex . to perform the measurement ,  used a method previously employed in other @xmath33 analyses without prompt charged tracks , wherein the @xmath2 meson is constrained in the vertex fit to decay within the beamspot in the plane transverse to the beam direction  @xcite .",
    "this method exploits the threshold nature of the @xmath36 decay , where the @xmath2 mesons are almost at rest in the cm frame ( @xmath37 mev / c ) and therefore have negligible displacement in the lab frame in the non - boosted transverse direction .",
    "the resulting resolution of the @xmath35 position of the signal @xmath2 vertex is still better than the resolution on the vertex position of the other @xmath2 in the event , yielding a @xmath25 precision ( approximately @xmath38 ps ) comparable to that in modes where the signal @xmath2 has prompt charged tracks in the final state .",
    "only @xmath33 mesons that decay within the silicon vertex tracker can be used with this technique . however , as there are two @xmath33 mesons in the final state , while only one is needed to employ this method , the fraction of signal decays suitable for the time - dependent measurement at  is approximately @xmath39 in this mode .",
    "if no time - dependent measurement is performed , an integrated flavor or charge asymmetry can be measured :    @xmath40     + a non - zero value of this asymmetry signifies the presence of direct @xmath3 violation . in the @xmath41 modes ,",
