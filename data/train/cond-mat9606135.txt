    "collective density fluctuations in superconductors due to the breakdown of the global gauge invariance are well known theoretically @xcite . however , since these modes couple to charge oscillations , the long range coulomb force usually pushes up their energies to the plasma frequency .",
    "one possibility to avoid the coulomb interaction completely , is to consider spin fluctuations instead of charge fluctuations between the layers . in the following",
    "we will show the existence of such a sharp , collective spin mode in the gap , which might have been observed@xcite in inelastic neutron scattering on y - ba - cu - o .",
    "we consider an electronic double - layer system described by the hamiltonian @xmath1 : @xmath2 here @xmath3 describes a tight - binding coupling between the two layers @xmath4 , while @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) are intra-(inter)-layer pairing interactions and the josephson - like coupling @xmath7 describes the coherent transfer of two particles from one layer to the other . in a previous publication",
    "@xcite we treated this model using the nambu formalism including vertex corrections to calculate charge fluctuations between the layers .    in this paper",
    "we are primarily interested in the calculation of correlation functions involving the operator @xmath8 describing the difference of the spin polarization in the two layers and the operators coupling to it ( @xmath9 ) @xmath10 the quantity @xmath11 corresponds to the spin current between the two layers . @xmath12 and @xmath13 describe pairing in different layers in a spin - triplet state with total spin @xmath14 and are the real and imaginary part of the inter - layer triplet - pairing amplitude @xmath15 . to shorten the notation",
    ", we introduce @xmath16 @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) being the pauli matrices in the nambu or two - layer space , respectively ( examples : @xmath19 ) .",
    "in general the correlation functions @xmath20 have to be determined numerically . however , for constant hopping @xmath21 with @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the superconducting s - wave gap ) and weak coupling the collective modes can be calculated analytically ( for @xmath24 ) in the cases i ( ii ) of _ pure _ intra-(inter)-layer pairing . @xmath25    a spin polarization @xmath26 with opposite sign in the two layers obviously induces inter - layer triplet - amplitudes @xmath13 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "these results are closely connected to the collective modes discovered in density - density - correlation functions like @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) in our previous work.@xcite for pure inter-(intra)-layer pairing one has the exact relation @xmath29 which follows from a unitary change of representation @xmath30 with @xmath31    the goldstone theorem @xcite predicts the existence of excitations with vanishing energy , if a continuous , dynamical symmetry @xmath32 ( @xmath33 = 0 $ ] ) is spontaneously broken , e.g. the groundstate @xmath34 is not an eigenstate of @xmath32 . thereby it can help to classify the resonances found in the correlation functions ( [ correl ] ) as so - called goldstone modes connected with certain symmetries of @xmath35 .    assuming pure singlet pairing in equilibrium",
    ", the superconducting groundstate is given by @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 being the singlet - order parameters for intra- and inter - layer pairing , respectively .",
    "the analytical calculations of case i",
    "( ii ) refer to pure intra-(inter-)layer pairing with @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "table [ tabellespontan ] shows ( for different parameters @xmath41 ) the symmetries @xmath42 , which are broken in the presence of intra-(inter)-layer pairing @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    ".[tabellespontan ] broken symmetries if @xmath43 or @xmath44 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the spontaneous breakdown @xmath45 of the global gauge symmetry , which is generated by the total particle number , in @xmath46 is a defining property of the superconducting phase ( case 4 ) , as it is invariably connected with non - vanishing cooper - pair amplitudes ( @xmath47 ) .    in eq .",
    "[ correl ] goldstone modes ( @xmath48 ) appear in case",
    "i ( ii ) , if and only if @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "we can identify these resonances in case i ( ii ) with the modes in table [ tabellespontan ] in the cases 1 ( 3 ) , which are connected with the symmetries @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the transformations @xmath53 show that in both cases the @xmath54=0-component @xmath55 of the triplet - order parameter is excited , which for @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) also creates non - vanishing expectation values @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) and finite responses @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) to an external spin polarization @xmath26 .",
    "thereby @xmath51 mixes intra - layer pairs @xmath60with triplet - inter - layer pairs @xmath61 , which is connected with a spin transfer between the layers without breaking up cooper pairs . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath52 leaves the modulus of the pairing amplitudes invariant , but creates a phase difference between @xmath62 and @xmath63 , which is the origin of a supercurrent of inter - layer pairs , the so - called _ spin josephson - effect_. this terminology is motivated by the close analogy to the usual josephson effect , where a charge rather than a spin transfer is driven by a phase difference of intra- rather than inter - layer pairs .",
    "the density - modes @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) , which correspond according to the relation ( [ intrainter ] ) to the spin modes @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) , can be observed as poles in @xmath66 calculated in our previous work @xcite rather than in @xmath67 . according to eq .",
    "[ correl ] all these modes can not be excited in the absence of particle transfer ( @xmath50 ) between the layers .",
    "finally , @xmath68 connects groundstates with different ratios of inter- and intra - layer - pairing , which for @xmath50 in case 1 and 2 are energetically degenerate .",
    "we carried out numerical calculations for @xmath69 using two slightly different effective masses @xmath70 for the two bands @xmath71 and parameters : @xmath72 ev , @xmath73 ev ( cut - off in k - space ) , @xmath74 ( @xmath75 : averaged density of states of the two bands ) .",
    "then the pairing is mixed and for @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) dominated by intra-(inter)-layer pairing .",
    "[ ssinterintra ] shows the imaginary part of the spin - polarization function for different @xmath7 in the case a ( b ) of dominant inter-(intra)-layer pairing at @xmath78 .",
    "the collective modes appear as @xmath79-peaks below the onset of particle hole excitations around 60 mev . in the appropriate",
    "parameter range the resonances in case a ( b ) coincide with the poles calculated analytically in eq .",
    "[ correl ] in case ii ( i ) , but they exist in a much larger parameter range . for larger positive or negative @xmath7-values than given in the figures the mode frequencies pass zero indicating an instability of the system .",
    "the spectral weight of the phase mode decreases for dominant inter - layer pairing going from negative to positive @xmath7 as indicated by the spectral weight @xmath80 in the approximation formula ( [ approx ] ) .    for positive @xmath7 a further collective mode , the so - called amplitude mode , can be seen in both cases .",
    "it is inside the particle - hole spectrum for small @xmath7 , but undamped for large @xmath7 ( arrows ( a ) or small peaks below the particle - hole threshold ( b ) ) . because of the mixing of intra - layer and inter - layer pairing the spin excitation couples to both the phase @xmath12 and the amplitude @xmath13 of the triplet order - parameter",
    "this causes two collective modes , which were already discussed in @xcite .            to conclude , the anti - ferromagnetic spin polarization couples to the phase and amplitude of the triplet - order parameter with @xmath14 .",
    "this causes a collective mode where spin - up and spin - down particle tunnel in opposite direction ( _ spin josephson - effect _ ) .",
    "this might be connected with a resonance found in magnetic neutron scattering on y - ba - cu - o at finite @xmath83 , which shows the same temperature dependence as our mode@xcite .",
