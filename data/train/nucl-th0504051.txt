    "in recent years , a dynamical model had been developed@xcite to investigate electromagnetic pion production reactions in the region near the @xmath0(1232 ) resonance .",

    "fairly consistent descriptions of all of the available data in the @xmath0 region have been obtained . in this work",
    ", we further extend this model ( called the sl model ) to address two questions of current interest : ( 1 ) will hadron - quark duality first observed by bloom and gilman@xcite in inclusive @xmath16 be also seen in the neutrino - induced @xmath17 and @xmath18 reactions ? ( 2 ) how can parity violating asymmetry of inclusive @xmath19 reaction be used to improve our knowledge about the axial @xmath1-@xmath0 form factor ?",
    "experimental data for testing our predictions can be obtained at new neutrino facilities@xcite and jefferson laboratory ( jlab)@xcite .",
    "our first step is to construct neutral currents within the sl model .",
    "this then allows us to extend our previous calculations@xcite of @xmath20 reactions to also predict @xmath21 reactions for examining some questions concerning the quark - hadron duality .",
    "simply speaking , an inclusive lepton scattering observable exhibits quark - hadron duality when an average of this quantity over an appropriately chosen scaling variable in the resonance region is close to that in the deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) region .",
    "more details on this subject can be found in a recent review by melnitchouk , ent and keppel@xcite .",
    "the quark - hadron duality was first observed@xcite for the @xmath22 structure function @xmath23 .",
    "recent experimental data@xcite for both @xmath5 and @xmath24 have further confirmed more quantitatively this interesting observation .",
    "theoretical attempts in understanding the quark - hadron duality within qcd were already made@xcite in 1970 s .",
    "more recent works are reported in , for example , refs.@xcite .",
    "within the standard model@xcite , it is natural to ask whether the quark - hadron duality should also exist in the neutrino - induced @xmath25 and @xmath18 reactions ( from nowon , @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the neutrinos and charged leptons , respectively , of any generation within the standard model ) . in the absence of necessary neutrino data ,",
    "this can be explored theoretically in the @xmath0 region using the extended sl model presented in this paper .",
    "obviously , we can only explore the local quark - hadron duality in the @xmath0 region .",
    "we will also report on our investigations of the spin dependent structure functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 of @xmath3 processes . to see the accuracy of our model in predicting these quantities ,",
    "we first show that some recent data@xcite of the polarization observables associated with the exclusive @xmath11 and @xmath28 reactions agree well with the predictions from the considered sl model .",
    "we then find that @xmath9 calculated from our model agree reasonably well with the recent data@xcite , but do not show quark - hadron duality when compared with the dis data@xcite .",
    "the calculated @xmath10 is also found to be rather different from the dis data which can be described reasonably well by the wandzura - wilczek formula@xcite .",
    "our second task in this work is to apply the extended sl model to address some questions concerning the @xmath1-@xmath0 form factors .",
    "it has been well recognized that these form factors are important information for testing current hadron models and also lattice qcd calculations in the near future .",
    "the vector parts of the @xmath1-@xmath0 form factors in the @xmath29 ( gev / c)@xmath30 region have been rather well determined by analyzing very extensive high precision data of electromagnetic pion production reactions , as reviewed in ref.@xcite . on the other hand , the axial vector @xmath1-@xmath0 form factor is not well determined mainly because of the short of high precision data of neutrino - induced pion production reactions in the @xmath0 region .",
    "for example , the axial @xmath1-@xmath0 from factor determined in ref.@xcite is rather different from the one determined previously@xcite .",
    "this leads to uncertainties in interpreting the axial @xmath1-@xmath0 form factor in terms of the hadron structure calculations such as those reported in refs.@xcite .",
    "the situation will be improved when the data from new neutrino facilities become available in the near future .",
    "alternatively , progress can be made by following refs.@xcite to investigate the parity violating asymmetry of inclusive @xmath2 reactions .",
    "this polarization observable is due to the interference between the electromagnetic currents and neutral currents and hence can be used to explore the axial @xmath1-@xmath0 form factor .",
    "experimental effort in this direction is being made@xcite at jlab . to facilitate this study",
    ", we have applied the extended sl model to explore the dependence of the parity violating asymmetry of @xmath2 on the axial @xmath1-@xmath0 form factor .    in section",

    "we first recall their forms in the standard model@xcite and then specify how such currents are defined in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom of the sl model . in section iii , we give expressions of the inclusive cross sections and indicate how the structure functions are calculated within our hadronic model and parton model .",

    "however , they can not be used directly for investigating meson production reactions in the resonance region where the perturbative qcd is not applicable . at the present time ,",
    "the most tractable ways for investigating these reactions are in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the starting point is a hadronic effective lagrangian constrained by the symmetry properties of the standard model .",

    "furthermore , the non - resonant mechanisms considered in those works also differ from what are illustrated in fig.1 and well tested in extensive investigations of exclusive @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 reactions .",
    "for example , the vector meson exchanges are not included in refs.@xcite and pseudo - scalar @xmath72 coupling , instead of the pseudo - vector coupling used in the sl model , is used in ref.@xcite .    the resonant term in eq.(16 )",

    "is that the structure functions in the resonance region should slide along the parton model predictions as @xmath131 increases .",
    "this is clearly the case in figs.5 - 7 for @xmath215 ( gev / c)@xmath30 . in fig.8",
    "we further show within the employed sl hadronic model that this should also be the case up to rather high",

    "the existing slac data@xcite do not have enough high accuracy for investigating the @xmath0 at @xmath217 about 6 ( gev / c)@xmath30 .",
    "we now turn to discussing the spin dependent structure functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we first note from eqs.(33)-(36 ) that these functions depend on the interference terms @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "such terms also determine various polarization observables of the exclusive @xmath11 and @xmath12 precesses , as discussed in , for example , ref.@xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to test the sl model predictions against the recent data from such polarization measurements@xcite .",
    "it is clear from figs.9 - 12 that the sl model can describe the jlab data very well and certainly can be used here to investigate the spin dependent structure functions .",
    "the details of these comparisons can be found in refs.@xcite and also in the captions of figs.9 - 12 .",
    "our results for @xmath9 and @xmath10 of @xmath22 are shown in fig.13 . in the left side of",
    "fig.13 we again see that our predictions for @xmath9 ( solid curves ) agree reasonably well with the data@xcite .",
    "( note that the determination of these @xmath9 data from the polarization data of ref.@xcite involved some model dependent input@xcite . ) to get the parton model predictions using eq.(40 ) , we need to known the spin dependent parton distribution functions .",
    "however the determination of such information in the considered large @xmath220 region is still in developing stage and therefore no attempt is made here to do calculation using eq.(40 ) .",
    "instead , we assume that the parton model predictions can be identified with the dashed curve which is from fitting the data of @xmath9 measured in deeply inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "the left side of fig.13 then indicates that @xmath9 clearly does not exhibit the local quark - hadron duality .",
    "such a disagreement was in fact expected@xcite by considering the constraints imposed by the ellis - jaffe integral@xcite and drell - hearn - gerasimov sum rule@xcite .",
    "it is known@xcite that the naive parton model , considered here , can not predict @xmath10 .",

    "clearly it disagrees with the predictions ( solid curves ) from the considered hadronic sl model . unlike the result for @xmath9",
    ", there is no simple explanation of such a similar breakdown of local quark - hadron duality .",
    "the quark - hadron duality for the spin dependent structure functions of @xmath222 and @xmath189 are not investigated here since there are no corresponding pqcd calculations or data from deeply inelastic scattering data to compare with .",
    "the formula for calculating parity violating asymmetry @xmath13 of @xmath2 reactions have been given in literatures@xcite .",
    "for our purposes , we write it in terms of structure functions defined in section iii . with some straightforward derivations ,",
    "we have @xmath223 with @xmath224 here the electromagnetic structure functions @xmath225 are calculated from eqs.(26)-(27 ) with @xmath160 . the interference term @xmath226 between the electromagnetic and neutral currents",
    "can also be calculated from eqs.(26)-(28 ) with the following replacements @xmath227 obviously these quantities can also be calculated from integration @xmath228 defined in eq.(29 ) .",
    "we next focus on the first two terms of @xmath1 of eq.(48 ) which depend on @xmath229 . here",
    "we note that @xmath229 is the symmetric part of the hadron tensor defined in eq.(19 ) .",
    "hence they can only have the contributions from the vector parts of neutral currents because of the vector structure eq.(5 ) of the electromagnetic current . to see this more clearly",
    ", we use eq.(8 ) to write the neutral current as@xmath230 with @xmath231 obviously the @xmath232 $ ] part of eq.(50 ) will not contribute to @xmath229 and hence the first two terms of @xmath1 of eq.(48 ) can then be written as @xmath233 where @xmath234 is defined in eq.(49 ) and @xmath235 is the same as @xmath226 with @xmath236 replaced by the isoscalar vector current [ @xmath237 defined in eq.(51 ) .",
    "thus only the non - resonant isospin @xmath238 @xmath105 state contribute to @xmath235 . with the above relation ,",
    "eq.(47 ) for the asymmetry can then be written as @xmath239 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & - q^2 [ 8.99 \\times 10^{-5 } ] ( 1.075 + \\delta_v + \\delta_a ) \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath131 is in unit of ( gev / c)@xmath30 and @xmath240 in eq.(52 ) we have evaluated ( @xmath241 which is a model - independent constant and is the main contribution to the asymmetry .",
    "this term was identified by cahn and gilman@xcite and later investigators@xcite .",
    "we now note that the term @xmath242 defined by ( 54 ) depends only on @xmath243 which is antisymmetric as defined in eq.(19 ) .",
    "because of the vector structure of electromagnetic current eq.(5 ) , @xmath243 can only have the contributions from the axial vector parts of neutral currents .",
    "clearly , the information about the axial vector @xmath1-@xmath0 form factor , which is the quantity we hope to learn about as discussed in section i , is isolated in @xmath242 through its dependence on @xmath243 .",
    "therefore it is important to identify the region where @xmath242 is much larger than @xmath244 such that the extracted axial @xmath1-@xmath0 form factor has less model dependence .    as mentioned above , only the non - resonant isospin @xmath245 @xmath105 final states contributes to @xmath235 .",
    "thus we expect that @xmath244 is weaker than @xmath242 near the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.14 for incident electron energy @xmath246 gev .",
    "we see that @xmath242 ( solid curve ) is indeed much larger than @xmath244 at energies near @xmath204 gev of the @xmath0 position .",
    "this is also the case for other typical electron kinematics which can be conducted at jlab , as illustrated in fig.15 .",
    "the contribution from @xmath242 ( solid curves ) are clearly much larger than @xmath244 ( dashed curves )",
    ". therefore the asymmetry data at resonance position @xmath204 gev can be used to extract the contributions from the axial vector currents .",
    "we now focus on examining how @xmath242 depends on the axial @xmath1-@xmath0 form factor . recalling eqs.(16)-(18 ) for the current matrix elements , @xmath242 , like other observables , contains contributions from the resonant and non - resonant amplitudes .",
    "as seen in fig.16 , the non - resonant contribution ( dotted curve near the bottom ) is very small compared with the full model prediction ( solid curve ) .",
    "this agrees with previous investigations@xcite , although those earlier works neglected the unitary condition as discussed in section i. the large difference between the solid and the dotted curves in fig.16 indicates that @xmath242 is a useful quantity for extracting the dressed axial @xmath1-@xmath0 form factor defined by eq.(18 ) .",
    "when the pion cloud effects ( second term of eq.(18 ) ) on the @xmath1-@xmath0 transition is turned off , we obtain the dash curves . this is consistent with our previous findings in refs.@xcite that pion cloud effects on @xmath1-@xmath0 transition are significant .",
    "we present in fig.17 our predictions of asymmetry @xmath13 for several incident electron energies @xmath247 gev and at the @xmath0 peak . here",
    "we note that our result for @xmath248 gev is about 10 @xmath249 larger than that shown in fig.6 of ref.@xcite . furthermore",
    ", their @xmath13 decreases with @xmath131 in striking difference with our predictions .",
    "this is perhaps mainly due to the use of different @xmath1-@xmath0 form factor , but the differences in treating the non - resonant amplitudes , which interfere with the dominant @xmath1-@xmath0 transition amplitude , also play some roles .",
    "experimental tests of our predictions in fig.17 will be useful in examining the extent to which the axial @xmath1-@xmath0 form factor eq.(15 ) , which was determined in our study@xcite of @xmath250 reaction , is valid .    as pointed out in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the form factor eq.(15 ) is rather different from the form @xmath251 with @xmath252 and @xmath253 ( gev / c)@xmath30 which was determined in earlier works@xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to see how these two form factors can be distinguished by the parity violation asymmetry of @xmath254 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.18 .",
    "experiment test of our prediction shown in fig .",
    "18 will help distinguish these two axial @xmath1-@xmath0 form factors .    to end this section , we return briefly to the investigation of quark - hadron duality presented in section iv .",
    "it is also interesting to explore@xcite whether the quark - hadron duality also exists in the parity violating asymmetry @xmath13 .",
    "this can be done here by comparing the predictions of our hadronic model and that of parton model .",
    "the formula for calculating @xmath13 within the parton model was derived in ref.@xcite . keeping only the @xmath37 and @xmath38 quarks in the considered large @xmath220 region ,",
    "one finds for a proton target @xmath255-c_{1d}[d(x)+\\bar{d}(x ) ] + y[2c_{2u}(u(x)-\\bar{u}(x))-c_{2d}(d(x)+\\bar{d}(x ) ) ] } { 4(u(x)+\\bar{u}(x))+(d(x)+\\bar{d}(x ) ) } \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath256 note that @xmath257 is the ratio between the longitudinal and transverse total cross sections .",
    "we use the values of @xmath257 calculated from the sl model .",
    "the variable @xmath258 depends on incident electron energy @xmath138 and the energy transfer @xmath61 .",
    "the other coefficients in eq.(55 ) depend on the electroweak coupling constants for leptons and quarks @xmath259 when the radiative corrections within the standard model is included @xcite @xmath260 .",
    "these values are only slightly different from those calculated from eq.(59 ) .",
    "the asymmetry of @xmath254 predicted from our hadronic model ( solid curves ) and parton model ( dashed curves ) for several typical electron kinematics are compared in fig.19 .",
    "if our hadronic model results ( solid curves ) are confirmed experimentally , the parity violating asymmetry in the @xmath0 region obviously does not show local quark - hadron duality .",
    "the situation is similar to the results for the spin dependent structure functions shown in fig.14 .",
    "the dynamical model developed in refs.@xcite ( the sl model ) has been extended to include the weak neutral current contributions for investigating all possible electroweak pion production reactions in the region near the @xmath0 excitation .",
    "the main purpose is to examine the quark - hadron duality in the neutrino - induced reactions and to explore how the axial @xmath1-@xmath0 transition form factor can be determined by using the parity violating asymmetry of @xmath254 .",
    "the experimental data for testing our predictions can be obtained at jlab and new neutrino facilities .",
    "we have found that the @xmath3 structure functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 predicted by the sl model are in good agreement with the recent data@xcite which had verified more quantitatively the quark - hadron duality first observed by bloom and gilman@xcite .",
    "the predicted structure functions for @xmath7 and @xmath8 processes also show quark - hadron duality to the extent similar to what has been observed in @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , we also predict that quark - hadron duality should also be seen in all electroweak reactions on the neutron or equivalently the isospin @xmath213 deuteron - like target .",
    "these results suggest that the sl model can be a candidate hadronic model for developing a theoretical understanding of quark - hadron duality within the standard model .",
    "for example , it will be interesting to explore which parts of the predictions from the sl model can be related to the predictions from the parton model .",
    "this is clearly a difficult question to answer and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have also investigated the spin dependent structure functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 of @xmath3 .",
    "it is found that the quark - hadron duality is not seen in the calculated @xmath9 and @xmath10 , while our results for @xmath9 and some polarization observables associated with the exclusive @xmath11 and @xmath12 reactions are in good agreement with the recent data .",
    "experimental data for @xmath10 in the @xmath0 region are clearly needed . if our predictions are confirmed , we perhaps have more complete information for exploring why the quark - hadron duality breaks down in the spin dependent structure functions .",
    "we should also emphasize that our investigations of quark - hadron duality are rather qualitative since they are based on the naive parton model . to test local quark - hadron duality @xmath214",
