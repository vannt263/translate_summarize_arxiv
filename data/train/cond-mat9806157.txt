    "materials that present extremely large magnetoresistance have potential technological applications . as mixed valence compounds of the form @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 can be ca , sr or ba ) show colossal magnetoresistance there is a renewed interest in these oxides with perovskite structure@xcite .",
    "there is a big correlation between the magnetic and the transport properties of these oxide manganites . for @xmath3 and low temperatures ,",
    "the system is metallic and presents ferromagnetic order . as the temperature ( @xmath4 ) increases the system becomes insulator and paramagnetic .",
    "the metallic ( insulator ) behavior is defined in the sense that @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , being @xmath7 the electrical resistivity . in the insulating phase",
    "the resistivity is bigger than the mott resistivity @xmath8@xcite .",
    "the magnetic transition occurs at a @xmath9-dependent critical temperature @xmath10 .",
    "the metal to insulator transition occurs at a temperature very close to @xmath0 . for @xmath11 and low temperatures",
    "the system is a layer antiferromagnet with ferromagnetic coupling inside planes . at @xmath12 phase separation between hole - rich and hole - poor regions",
    "has been predicted@xcite .",
    "the electron - electron interaction plays an important role at low temperatures , and it produces charge ordering at particular values of @xmath13 and always for values of @xmath14@xcite .    in",
    "the @xmath15 oxides the electronically active orbitals are believed to be the @xmath15 @xmath16 orbitals , and the mean @xmath16 occupancy is @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath15 ions are located at the corners of a simple cubic lattice , and they feel the cubic crystal symmetry , which splits the @xmath16 orbitals into a @xmath18 triplet and a @xmath19 doublet .",
    "there is also a strong ferromagnetic hund s rule coupling which align all electron spins in the @xmath15 @xmath16 orbitals .",
    "the physical picture is that three electrons fill up the @xmath18 levels forming a core spin @xmath20 of magnitude @xmath21 and the rest of the electrons go to the @xmath19 orbitals . for small values of @xmath9 ,",
    "the perovskites show a long - range jahn - teller order which selects a preferred combination of the @xmath19 orbitals and therefore it is possible to assume that the electrons move only through one @xmath16 orbital .    to explain the ferromagnetism in these materials zener@xcite introduced a double exchange ( de ) mechanism , in which the electrons get mobility between the @xmath15 ions using the magnetically inert oxygen as an intermediate .",
    "the oxygens are located at the center of the lines connecting the @xmath15 ions .",
    "this conduction process is proportional to the electron transfer integral and due to the strong ferromagnetic hund s rule coupling it is maximum when the two cores spins involved in the process are parallel and it is zero when they are antiparallel .",
    "so in the de model ferromagnetic coupling between @xmath22 and @xmath23 arises from the hopping of the electrons in the @xmath19 orbitals .",
    "because the alignment of spins on neighboring sites favors electronic motion , the ferromagnetic ground state maximize the electron kinetic energy .",
    "when the temperature increases , the de model undergoes a phase transition towards a paramagnetic state . in this phase",
    "the core spins are randomly oriented and fluctuate at frequencies related only to the temperature . in the paramagnetic phase the electrons minimize their kinetic energy .",
    "the de model was more precisely formulated and extended by anderson and hasegawa@xcite and by de gennes@xcite .",
    "mean field theories have shown that the ferro to paramagnetic phase transitions at @xmath0 is accompanied by a change in the temperature dependence of the resistivity@xcite .",
    "however these calculations do not show metal to insulator transition at temperatures near @xmath0 .",
    "these mean field calculations do not take into account the effect of the berry phase arising from particle motion in a spin background@xcite .",
    "also the possible localization of electrons by the spin disorder in the paramagnetic phase is neglected .",
    "varma@xcite proposed that random hopping in the paramagnetic phase is sufficient to localize electrons and induce a metal to insulator transition at the magnetic critical temperature .",
    "however li _ et al_@xcite have studied the mobility edge of the de model in the limit of @xmath24 and they have found that random hopping alone is not enough to induce anderson localization at the fermi level in the range @xmath25 .",
    "similar results were reported by allub and alascio@xcite using the ziman criterion@xcite .    in this work",
    "we study the temperature dependence of the electric conductance of the de model for different values of the electron concentration .",
    "we find that the system s metallic at all temperatures and , contrary to the mean field results , we do not observe any feature in the temperature dependence of the resistivity near the magnetic critical temperature .",
    "we calculate the dc conductance , @xmath26 , by using the kubo formula .",
    "we perform monte carlo simulations on the classical spin orientations of the de model@xcite , and for each electron concentration and temperature we obtain a statistical ensemble of clusters of @xmath15 ions .",
    "we obtain the conductance by averaging over several configurations .",
    "the temperatures we are interested are @xmath27 ( @xmath10 ) and these temperatures are much smaller than the electron fermi temperature for @xmath28 .",
    "therefore we always consider , both in the monte carlo simulations and in the conductance calculations , that the electron temperature is zero .    in our model the @xmath15 ion spins",
    "are treated as classical and quantum effects , as absorption and emission of spin density waves , are not correctly described .",
    "although quantum effects should be important at very low temperatures@xcite , they do not matter at temperatures near @xmath0 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows , in section ii we introduce the de hamiltonian and describe the monte carlo calculations . in section iii",
    "we give some remarks about the use of the kubo formula in the present context .",
    "section iv is dedicated to present and discuss the results of the paper , and we finish in section v with a summary .",
    "for large jahn - teller splittings , the electronic and magnetic properties of the @xmath15 oxides are described by the following ferromagnetic kondo lattice hamiltonian@xcite , @xmath29 where @xmath30 creates an electron at site @xmath31 and spin @xmath32 , @xmath33 represents the classical core spin at site @xmath31 , @xmath34 is the hopping amplitude between nearest - neighbor sites and @xmath35 is the hund s rule coupling energy . in the limit of infinite @xmath35 , eq.(1 )",
    "becomes the de hamiltonian , @xmath36 here @xmath37 creates an electron at site @xmath31 with spin parallel to @xmath38 , and the hopping amplitude acquires a berry phase and it becomes a complex number given by@xcite , @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the angles which characterize the orientation of @xmath42 .",
    "this complex hopping appears after rotating the conduction electron spins so that the spin quantization axis at site @xmath31 is parallel to @xmath38 , and then project onto the spin parallel to @xmath43 .    in order to calculate the electrical conductance , for each @xmath4 and @xmath9 ,",
    "it is necessary a statistical ensemble of clusters , which simulates the thermal fluctuations .",
    "each cluster is characterized by a set of core spin @xmath44 and its chemical potential @xmath45 .",
    "we obtain the clusters by performing monte carlo simulations on the variables @xmath46 and @xmath47 of the hamiltonian eq.(2 ) . in each monte carlo step",
    "it is necessary to diagonalize a matrix of size equal to the number of @xmath15 ions in the clusters and the de energy is the sum of the eigenenergies of the occupied electron levels . in this process",
    "we assume that the electron fermi energy is much bigger than the temperatures of interest in this work ( at @xmath480.2 , @xmath49 2000@xmath50 and @xmath51 300@xmath50 ) .",
    "the diagonalization imposes a restriction on the dimension of the unit cell used in the simulations .",
    "recently two of us have studied , by using monte carlo simulations , the magnetic phase diagram of the de model@xcite . to avoid finite size problems in the simulation , the following approximation for the energy has been obtained and used for the de energy , @xmath52 here @xmath53 and @xmath54 are quantities which depend on @xmath9 and do not depend on temperature , @xmath55 is the average of the absolute value of the hopping amplitude and @xmath56 represents the angle formed by the core spins located at sites @xmath31 and @xmath57 . in reference @xcite it was showed that expression ( 4 ) is a good approximation to the de kinetic energy . in that work",
    "it was also concluded that the magnetic critical temperatures of the de model are in the range of the experimental ones , and it was obtained that the complex phase of the hopping amplitude has a negligible effect in the value of @xmath0 .    using the conclusions of the cited work , in this paper we perform monte carlo simulations on the variables @xmath46 and @xmath47 , using the expression ( 4 ) for the de energy .",
    "the simulations are performed in @xmath58 cubic lattices .",
    "technical details about the monte carlo calculations are given in reference @xcite , here just say that typically 5000 - 7000 monte carlo steps per spin are used for thermal equilibration .",
    "the different clusters which form the statistical ensemble are chosen every 100 steps per spin after equilibration .",
    "in calculating the conductance of the system we use the standard kubo formula @xcite .",
    "the static electrical conductivity at chemical potential @xmath45 is given by @xmath59 \\ ; , \\label{kuboe}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is calculated from the advanced and retarded green functions @xmath61 \\ ; , \\ ] ] and the velocity ( current ) operator @xmath62 is related to the position operator @xmath63 through the equation of motion @xmath64 \\ ; , \\label{motion}\\ ] ] @xmath65 being the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( 2 ) .",
    "the last ingredient that is necessary for the evaluation of the kubo formula is the velocity operator .",
    "it is obtained through eq.([motion ] ) once the position operator @xmath82 is known .",
    "this operator is determined by the spatial shape of the electric potential energy .",
    "taking advantage from the fact that the detailed form of the electric field does not matter within one - electron linear response theory , an abrupt potential drop at one of the two cluster sides provides the simplest numerical implementation of the kubo formula @xcite .",
    "certainly , eq.([motion ] ) shows that nonvanishing elements of the velocity operator are restricted to the two layers at the sides of the potential drop .",
    "furthermore , the trace appearing in eq.([kuboe ] ) makes the knowledge of the green functions on the same restricted set of sites enough for the evaluation of the conductance .",
    "consequently , green functions are just evaluated for two consecutive layers at the cluster boundary .",
    "we start showing the results corresponding to a perfect ferromagnetic system . in fig.1a",
    "we plot the conductance as a function of the chemical potential for a cluster of size @xmath83=20 at @xmath4=0 .",
    "the conductance is finite for chemical potentials in the range @xmath84 .",
    "this is the range of energies where the density of states of the perfect system is finite , see fig.1b .",
    "since at @xmath4=0 all core spins are aligned , the transport in the system is ballistic and the conductance is just limited by the size of the cluster . therefore , at @xmath4=0 the conductance is proportional to the number of transport channels at the fermi energy , which for large clusters increases as @xmath85 .",
    "we have verified this behavior for @xmath86 and also we have checked that for system sizes bigger than @xmath83=10 , the overall shape of @xmath26 does not depend on the cluster size .    in the opposite limit",
    "we have calculated the conductance in the paramagnetic phase at @xmath24 . in this limit the orientation of the local spins @xmath87 is random .",
    "we choose @xmath38 to be uniformly distributed on a sphere , i.e. the probability @xmath88 of having a core spin with azimuthal angle @xmath47 is @xmath89 , whereas the polar angle distribution verifies @xmath90=1/2 .",
    "in fig.1 we plot the conductance and the density of states as a function of the energy in the @xmath24 limit .",
    "this quantities are averaged on many configurations of clusters of size @xmath83=20 .",
    "the density of states shows an effective band edge at @xmath91 .",
    "this occurs because the average value of the absolute value of the hopping amplitude at @xmath92 is @xmath93=2/3@xmath94 .",
    "although the band edge starts at @xmath95 , @xmath26 is different from zero only for values of the chemical potential in the range @xmath96 .",
    "the difference between the band edge energy and the minimum energy with @xmath97 is due to the fact that all the states with energy @xmath98 are localized and do not contribute to @xmath26 .",
    "therefore @xmath99 - 3.6@xmath34 is the @xmath100 mobility edge of the de model .",
    "this result is in agreement with localization length calculations@xcite , which located the mobility edge at @xmath101 .",
    "our calculations show that @xmath102 is constant for values of @xmath83 bigger than @xmath83=10 .",
    "this implies that for energies lower than @xmath103 the localization length is shorter than 10 lattice parameters . for @xmath10410 , the overall shape of the average conductance as",
    "a function of energy is almost independent of the cluster size , and its value increases linearly with @xmath83 .",
    "this implies that in the @xmath24 limit the system is metallic , the electron transport is diffusive and the system verifies the ohm s law : the cluster resistance is proportional to the cluster length and inversally proportional to the cross - sectional area .",
    "the proportionality constant is the resistivity @xmath7 .    as an example of this behavior we plot in fig.2 the average conductance at @xmath105 as a function of the cluster size @xmath83 .",
    "the linear behavior of @xmath26 versus @xmath83 down to @xmath83=4 , implies that the elastic mean free path is smaller than 4 lattice parameters .",
    "the slope of the straight line is the conductivity , in lattice parameter units , of the de model at @xmath92 and @xmath9=0.5 .",
    "in fig.1 we also plot the average conductance in the @xmath106 limit of the de model but neglecting the berry s phase in the hopping amplitude i.e. @xmath107 . in this case",
    "@xmath26 is bigger than in the case of complex hopping .",
    "also it seems that the mobility edge appears at lower energies than in the complex hopping de model .",
    "the previous calculations correspond to the @xmath4=0 and @xmath24 limits .",
    "now we present the results for @xmath26 as a function of @xmath4 , for different values of @xmath9 . in these case the average of @xmath26 is done with an statistical ensemble of clusters which are obtained from monte carlo calculations as described in section ii .",
    "when @xmath4 increases the disorder in the system increases and two main effects occurs : a ) a @xmath4-dependent mobility edge appears at low energies and b ) the extended states acquire an elastic mean free path , @xmath108 , which decreases with @xmath4 .    with respect to point a ) we know that in the maximum disorder case ( @xmath109 ) , the mobility edge is @xmath110 .",
    "this energy is very close to the effective band edge and only less than 0.5@xmath111 of the total states are localized . for lower temperatures we expect @xmath112 to be closer to the effective band edge and",
    "the number of localized states should be even smaller .",
    "we are interested in values of @xmath1130.1 for which the chemical potential is much higher than @xmath112 and for these electron concentrations we expect the system to be metallic at any @xmath4 . the de model is an insulator only at very small values of the electron concentration , @xmath1140.05 and high temperatures . with respect to the elastic mean free path , point b ) , we find that the conductivity of the system decreases continuously with @xmath4 , until it reaches the @xmath24 limit ( note that @xmath115 ) . on the contrary",
    "if @xmath108 is bigger than the cluster size the transport is ballistic , the conductance is determined by the cluster size , and increases as @xmath85 .",
    "when @xmath108 is shorter than @xmath83 the transport is diffusive and the conductance is proportional to @xmath83 .",
    "in fig.3 we plot the conductance divided by @xmath83 for @xmath9=0.5 and two values of the cluster size , @xmath83=16 and @xmath83=24 . for low temperatures the core spins disorder",
    "is very weak and the elastic mean free path is larger than the cluster size . in this regime",
    "the transport is ballistic and the conductivity increases linearly with @xmath83 . for large values of the temperature , @xmath116 is independent of @xmath83 .",
    "this is because the elastic mean free path is shorter than the cluster size and @xmath116 is the electrical conductivity in units of the system lattice parameter .",
    "for @xmath117 the values of @xmath116 obtained using @xmath118 and @xmath119 coincide , this implies that for these temperatures @xmath116 is the conductivity . for @xmath120",
    "the magnetic critical temperature is @xmath121 , and we can see in fig.3 that the conductivity is a smooth function of @xmath4 , practically constant , near @xmath0 .",
    "in fig.4 we present the same quantity @xmath116 as a function of @xmath4 for @xmath122 .",
    "also for this electron concentration the conductivity near @xmath0 is a smooth function of @xmath4 and the system is metallic .",
    "we have obtained similar results for different values of @xmath123 .",
    "the values for @xmath0 are taken from reference@xcite .    in fig.5",
    "we plot as a function of @xmath9 , the value of the conductivity in lattice units evaluated at @xmath0 . using the value of @xmath124 for the lattice parameter ,",
    "we obtain a resistivity @xmath125 at @xmath126 near @xmath0 .",
    "this resistivity is around ten times smaller than the experimental ones , which also have an insulator - like dependence with @xmath4 .",
    "this is a clear indication that it is necessary to add other terms to the double exchange hamiltonian , in order to explain the occurrence of the metal insulator transition at temperatures near the magnetic critical temperature@xcite .",
    "we have calculated the temperature dependence of the electrical conductance of the double exchange hamiltonian .",
    "the kubo formula has been use for the calculation of the conductance .",
    "conductance is defined as the average conductance over an statistical ensemble of clusters .",
    "these clusters are obtained by performing monte carlo simulations on the classical spin orientation of the double exchange hamiltonian .",
    "the calculations have been done for different electron concentrations .",
    "we find that the system is metallic at all temperatures and , contrary to the mean field calculations , we do not observe any change in the temperature dependence of the resistivity near the magnetical critical temperature .",
    "near @xmath0 the resistivity we obtain is around ten times smaller than the experimental value .",
    "we conclude that the double exchange model is not able to explain the metal to insulator transition which experimentally occurs at temperatures near the magnetic critical temperature .",
    "other effects not included in the de hamiltonian , as electron - electron interaction or electron- phonon interaction , are needed in order to understand the electrical behavior of the oxide @xmath15 .",
