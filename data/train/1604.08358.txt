    "numerical studies of periodic three - body orbits have increased their output over the past few years - more than 40 new orbits , and their `` satellites '' have been discovered , refs .",
    "@xcite . unlike periodic two - body orbits , which are all ellipses , and thus are all topologically equivalent , the non - colliding three - body periodic orbits have one of infinitely many different topologies .",
    "montgomery , ref .",
    "@xcite , had devised an algebraic method to associate a free - group element ( `` word '' ) @xmath7 with a three - body orbit s topology , and thus to label and classify such periodic orbits ; for an elementary introduction to this method , see ref .",
    "that classification method has recently acquired practical importance in the identification of new three - body orbits , refs .",
    "@xcite .    a number of newly discovered orbits , refs .",
    "@xcite , were of the so - called topological satellite type .",
    "such satellite orbits , are also known as `` bifurcation '' in the older literature , refs .",
    "@xcite , where they were only loosely defined in terms of their presumed origin .",
    "it was only in ref .",
    "@xcite that a precise definition of a topological satellite was given . when this definition was applied to the figure-8 satellites , reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , it led to the discovery of a remarkable `` topological kepler s third law''-like regularity for arbitrary orbits with vanishing angular momenta , ref .",
    "the immediate question is whether this regularity persists when the angular momentum does not vanish ?",
    "the present letter is an attempt to answer that question , albeit in a single , specific family of three - body orbits , _ viz .",
    "_ in the broucke - hadjidemetriou - h ' enon ( bhh ) family @xcite , that has the simplest non - trivial topology ( free group element @xmath7=a ) .",
    "the main reason for selecting only this family of orbits is that it is the most thoroughly studied family thus far : it is the only family of orbits with a previously determined dependence of the period @xmath2 on the angular momentum @xmath1 of ( non - satellite , or progenitor ) periodic orbits , refs .",
    "no such , or comparable , study of any of the remaining known families exists to our knowledge at this moment .",
    "moreover , the bhh family is one of only two families of periodic three - body orbits that have been observed in astronomy : all known `` hierarchical '' triple star systems belong to bhh orbits .",
    "moreover , the sun - earth - moon system may be viewed as a bhh solution , albeit with highly asymmetrical mass ratios .    the first step towards this goal , the one of finding as many different bhh satellite orbits as possible , has already been accomplished in ref .",
    "previously , davoust and broucke , ref .",
    "@xcite , had found one ( the first @xmath0=3 ) satellite of one retrograde bhh orbit .",
    "@xcite extended the search for retrograde bhh satellite orbits systematically up to values @xmath8 of the topological exponent @xmath0 , and more haphazardly up to @xmath9 ; thus several different types of bhh satellites with identical values of @xmath0 were discovered , , , see ref .",
    "@xcite , albeit with zero angular momentum .",
    "] as were a few prograde bhh satellites , see the supplemental material @xcite and the web site @xcite .",
    "prograde bhh satellites have not been studied systematically , as yet , mostly due to their paucity at the values of the angular momentum covered in the searches in ref .",
    "presently it is not known how many satellites ought to exist , and under which conditions .",
    "it is interesting , however , that the observed satellites correspond only to linearly stable bhh progenitor orbits .",
    "this is in line with hnon s 1976 conjecture @xcite about kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) stability of linearly stable bhh orbits .    then , motivated by the findings reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , we checked for similar regularities of satellite bhh orbits with non - zero angular momentum .",
    "firstly , we formulated the topological dependence of kepler s third law for three - body orbits with non - zero angular momenta , and secondly we tested it on the presently known satellites of the retrograde bhh family .",
    "secondly we found a striking result : all of our retrograde bhh satellites fall on a single ( continuous ) curve @xmath4 , fig .",
    "[ fig : sat_tl_interpolated ] that is practically indiscernible by naked eye from the @xmath5 curve , fig .",
    "[ fig : lt_bhh ] , for non - satellite ( progenitor ) retrograde bhh solutions , whereas the `` topologically uncorrected '' curve @xmath5 looks very differently , see fig . [",
    "fig : sat_retro_tl ] . a quantitative measure of this ( dis)agreement is shown in terms of corresponding standard deviations .",
    "broucke @xcite , hadjidemetriou @xcite and h ' enon @xcite ( bhh ) explored a set of periodic planar three - body orbits with equal mass bodies .",
    "these orbits form two continuous curves in the l - t plane whose lower ( retrograde ) terminus ( `` end '' ) is the collinear collision ( schubart ) orbit , and both the retrograde and the direct @xmath5 curves approach the same high - l limit at their upper termini , fig .",

    "@xcite . it turns out , however , that there are numerous relative periodic orbits with topology @xmath11 , with @xmath12 .",
    "such orbits are sometimes called satellites @xcite , whereas other authors call them `` bifurcation orbits '' @xcite .",
    "it is well known that kepler s third law ( for two bodies ) follows from the spatio - temporal scaling laws , which , in turn , follow from the homogeneity of the newtonian gravity s static potential , ref .",
    "these scaling laws read @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and consequently @xmath15 . the ( total ) energy scales as @xmath16 , the period @xmath2 as @xmath17 and angular momentum as @xmath18 , i.e. , differently than either the period @xmath2 , or `` size '' @xmath19 , which is the reason why only the vanishing angular momentum @xmath20 is a `` fixed point '' under scaling . for this reason ,",
    "we use scale - invariant angular momentum @xmath21 , scale - invariant period @xmath22 and , for simplicity s sake , equal masses .",
    "thus , we may replace the `` mean size '' @xmath23 of the three - body system in kepler s third law @xmath24 with the inverse absolute value of energy @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath26 , or equivalently @xmath27 .",
    "the `` constant '' on the right - hand - side of this equation is not a universal one in the three - body case , as it is in the two - body case ( where it depends only on the masses and the newtonian coupling @xmath28 ) : it may depend both on the family @xmath7 of the three - body orbit , described by the free - group word @xmath7 , and on the scale - invariant angular momentum @xmath21 of the orbit , see refs .",
    "@xcite , as follows @xmath29 or as an inverse function : @xmath30 thus , the curve @xmath31 as a function of @xmath32 is a fundamental property of any family @xmath7 of periodic orbits . for the bhh family the l(t ) curve , for fixed energy @xmath10 orbits ,",

    "[ fig : lt_bhh ] .",
    "we wish to see if the zero - angular - momentum relation @xmath33 , ref .",
    "@xcite , or some similar statement holds also at non - zero angular momentum ?",
    "the analogon of this relation for orbits with non - zero angular momenta would be a simple relation between l(t ) curves for the progenitor orbit @xmath34 and its @xmath0-th satellite @xmath35 : @xmath36 we shall test this relation in the bhh family of solutions , and in order to do so , we use the bhh satellite orbits from ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "the data are from table [ tab : overview1_norm].,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    after dividing the period t ( at fixed energy ) by the topological exponent @xmath0 , @xmath37 , we can see in fig . [",
    "fig : sat_tl_interpolated ] that the satellite orbits l(t/@xmath0 ) curve ( the angular momentum l as a function of topologically - rescaled period t/@xmath0 ) approximately coincides with the l(t ) curve of bhh retrograde orbits .",
    "it seems that such an appearance of order out of apparent disorder can not be an accident .",
    "next , in fig .",

    "note that the size of the dots on the diagram exceeds the corresponding numerical uncertainties ( `` error bars'').,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we have interpolated h ' enon s , @xcite , 18 stable retrograde data points with a piecewise polynomial fit in this part of the l(t ) curve .",
    "the standard deviations from this interpolated curve were calculated for : 1 ) broucke s 10 progenitor retrograde orbits , @xcite , and 2 ) the 56 out of 57 new satellite orbits from table [ tab : overview1_norm ] ( excluding one orbit that lies near the `` shoulder '' at t=14 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sat_tl_interpolated ] ) , with the following results .",
    "1 ) @xmath38 for broucke s orbits ; and 2 ) @xmath39 for satellite orbits .",
    "this difference of two orders of magnitude between these two numbers clearly indicates that the rescaled satellites periods do _ not _ coincide _ exactly _ with the progenitor ones , but only approximately .",
    "moreover , when one assembles h ' enon s and broucke s , @xcite , retrograde orbits in one set and fits the aggregate data by a polynomial of the sixth degree , fig .",
    "[ fig : sat_tl_interpolated ] , the standard deviation of the fit is @xmath40 , whereas the standard deviation of all satellite orbits from this polynomial curve is @xmath41 , roughly four times bigger .",
    "it is ( statistically ) clear that the satellites do not follow exactly the same l(t ) curve as the progenitors , but the deviation is not large .",
    "this constitutes the evidence for the analogon of the topological dependence of kepler s third law for the @xmath42 case , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , we note that all of our newly found satellite orbits fall into a region of the progenitor l(t ) curve that corresponds to stable progenitor bhh orbits , with one possible exception ( the red point near the `` shoulder '' at t=14 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sat_tl_interpolated ] ) , that `` sits '' on the border point between stable and unstable regions .",
    "we have not found any other satellites in this , the second stable region of bhh retrograde orbits . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sat_tl ] we show the fine structure in the satellites l(t/@xmath0 ) curve , that remains to be studied in finer detail and be better understood .",
    "we have not studied the direct / prograde ( sub)family of bhh orbits , as ref .",
    "@xcite did not search for their satellites , but found four almost inadvertently .",

    "@xcite , relative periodic solutions to the planar three body problem .",
    "thence followed a striking relation between their kinematic and topological properties .",
    "bhh orbits constitute a family with a simple topology , described by the free group element a according to the classification on the shape sphere , and their satellites are orbits of the topology @xmath11 .",
    "the bhh orbits angular momenta l and periods t form a continuous curve l(t ) , at fixed energy .",
    "our satellite orbits form a scattered set of points on the same l(t ) plot , but all of them exhibit the property that after their period t is divided by their topological order @xmath0 , they approximately fall on the l(t ) curve of the original ( @xmath43 ) bhh orbits .",
    "this study was motivated by the discovery , ref .",
    "@xcite , of a relation between the topology and periods among the satellites of the figure - eight orbit , ref.@xcite , and one other type ( `` moth i '' - `` yarn '' in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , of three - body orbits at vanishing angular momentum .",
    "this letter shows that kepler s third law s topological dependence also holds for orbits with @xmath42 , albeit only approximately .",
    "it remains to be seen just precisely what this discrepancy depends on ?    these results are even more striking if one remembers that among our results there are several distinct types of satellite orbits of the same topological power @xmath0 , some with quite different values of l and t , which all display this property",

    "an extension of the search conducted in ref .",
    "@xcite , into hitherto unexplored regions of the l - t plane ought to provide ( new ) data that will further test our result .",

    "@xcite , reproduced in the supplemental material @xcite , that the linearly stable bhh orbits are also nonlinearly , or perpetually , or kam stable .",
    "such kam stability implies the existence of quasiperiodic orbits with periods that conform to the quasiperiodicity condition ( i.e. with periods that are `` almost commensurate '' with the bhh progenitor s period ) , as predicted by the kam theorem , refs .",
