    "in the following , we shall investigate the linewidth narrowing effect of the @xmath0ls .",
    "first of all , we study the single - photon reflective properties under the resonant control field ( @xmath53 ) . and our emphasis is still put on the change of linewidth with the coupling strength , as shown in fig.3 . here",
    "the reflective spectrum appears a multiple peak - dip - peak structure ( eit - like reflective spectrum ) because of the interference between the two transitions .",
    "this is different from a single peak structure in the two - level system .",
    "but with the coupling strength decreasing , the two peaks is becoming declining and narrowing .",
    "this phenomenon is also appear in the above section .",
    "similarly , we can not obtain narrow reflective spectrum with the intensive amplitude only by the means of decreasing coupling strength in @xmath0ls .",
    "then we adjust the frequency of the control field and study the change of the reflective spectrum under the different detuning @xmath27 .",
    "as we all know , the weak coupling means that the decay rate to all other channels dominates over the decay rate of the excited atom to the waveguide modes .",
    "the obtained reflective spectrum is very faint when we decrease the coupling strength because that most of the spontaneous emission of emitters is guided into the free space or non - radiative emission .",
    "therefore , we should suppress the effects of spontaneous decay of the excited state and decrease the coupling strength at the same time .",
    "as we have mentioned above , the transition between the excited state @xmath11 and the metastable state @xmath25 is driven by a classical pulses with the corresponding rabi frequencies signified by @xmath26 .",
    "here we adopts the method proposed by law and eberly@xcite . by adjusting this interaction as far - detuned , we find two dissymmetrical peaks .",
    "one of central frequency locates at @xmath5 , whose change is the same as that of the single peak in tls .",
    "the other peak occurs at the double - photon resonance , which is the ultra - narrow reflective spectrum we need in this letter . and",
    "in this case , the excited state of the emitter can be adiabatically eliminated .",
    "it should be pointed out that the reflective spectrum of @xmath0ls has double dissymmetrical peaks and the tls has only one peak in the reflective spectrum .",
    "here we only use the peak under the case of double - photon resonance to compare with the single peak in tls .",
    "figure 4 shows the change of linewidth as the function of the ratio of @xmath19 . in fig.4",
    ", blue dot line , black dash line and red solid line respectively denote the reflective spectrums of tls , @xmath0ls with @xmath53 , and @xmath0ls with @xmath57 . all other parameters are chosen as the same except for the detuning @xmath27 . from fig.4 , we can see that the reflective spectrum of @xmath0ls is more intensive than that of tls under the same coupling strength . for the @xmath0ls resonant with the control field",
    ", the linewidth of the reflective spectrum has no significant change compared with that of tls .",
    "but when we increase the detuning @xmath27 and keep other parameter as the same , the linewidth can be narrowed greatly and the intensity can be highly preserved .     for tls and @xmath0ls . for tls , the parameters are set as follows : @xmath58 . for @xmath0ls ,",
    "the detuning @xmath27 is set to be 0 for the red solid line and 5 for the black dash line respectively . and",
    "all other parameters are set as follows : @xmath58 , @xmath54 , @xmath56.,width=302 ]    to see the effect of the detuning on the linewidth narrowing more clearly . in the following",
    ", we shall compare the reflective spectrum under the different detuning @xmath27 , as shown in fig.5 .",
    "we still choose the other parameters as the same besides the detuning @xmath27 . here",
    "black dash line , blue dot line and red solid line respectively denote the reflective spectrums of @xmath0ls with @xmath57 , @xmath0ls with @xmath59 , and @xmath0ls with @xmath60 .",
    "we can see that the reflective spectrum is getting more and more narrowing with the increase of the detuning @xmath27 .",
    "but the reflective amplitude is always maintained about 80% .",
    "this property can be utilized to construct a tunable narrow band source . and the needed narrowed frequency and linewidth can both be obtained by choosing approximate parameters .     for @xmath0ls with different @xmath27 .",
    "the detuning @xmath27 is set to be 5 for the black dash line , 10 for the blue dot line , and 15 for the red solid line respectively . and",
    "all other parameters are set as follows : @xmath58 , @xmath54 , @xmath56.,width=302 ]      in conclusion , we have proposed a scheme to construct a narrow - band source via a one - dimensional waveguide coupling with a three - level @xmath0-type emitter . through rigorous theoretical calculation , we find that a ultra - narrow reflective spectrum with intense amplitude can be obtained for the system work in a weak coupling regime and under a far - detuned control field . it is shown that the central frequency of narrowed spectrum can be tunable by choosing approximate parameters . and",
    "the system should work in the weak coupling regime to obtain the narrowed reflective spectrum , which has greatly decreased the requirement of the experiment .",
    "this approach opens up the possibility of plasmonic ultranarrow band source .",
