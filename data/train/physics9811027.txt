    "the development of quantitative methods of characterizing the living matter represents the subject of many researches of our days .",
    "the study of the electric ( dielectric ) properties of biological systems belongs to this kind of programs .",
    "a simple measurement of the dielectric permittivity of a living cells suspension provides us with an important set of data which can be used to describe the living matter @xcite .",
    "there are many factors which may influence the dielectric behavior of the biological materials : structure , molecular dipoles orientation , self interactions , surface conductance , diffusion , membrane transport processes etc .",
    "all these factors influence one each other and it is hard ( if not impossible ) to separate the effect of a single one . however , some effects are dominant in certain ranges of frequencies and certain conditions .",
    "for example , in the @xmath1-dispersion range ( 4 mhz-8 mhz ) , the dielectric behavior of the living cell suspensions is mainly influenced by the dielectric structure . at low frequencies ,",
    "it is dominated by the diffusion effects of the free charges accumulated around the cell membrane @xcite .",
    "also , the orientation of molecular dipoles and membrane transport processes become relevant when strong electric fields are applied . for a survey of the field and an extended bibliography",
    "one can consult @xcite .    the electric activity , in particular",
    ", the existence of the membrane potential is one of the simplest factor which allows us to discern between a living and a nonliving cell .",
    "we will show in this paper its influence on the dielectric properties of biological materials .",
    "our model do not include rotational effects or self interactions , so one expects that our results to be valid only for diluted suspensions and weak electric fields .",
    "we like to think that our work is complementary to the works done in electrophoresis , where the applied electric fields are very strong and the object of investigations is the induced membrane potential @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the applied electric fields are weak and the object of investigation is the influence of the membrane potential .",
    "we calculate the dielectric permittivity of suspensions of shelled , arbitrarily shaped particles with a superficial distribution of free charges on the two faces of the shell , in the limit of small concentrations and weak applied electric fields .",
    "the method used here is similar with that of @xcite , the basic tools being the functional calculus and the spectral decomposition of the operators . for the real situation ,",
    "the distributions of free charges are rather spatial than superficial . for usual values of the ( 3-d ) diffusion constants",
    ", they have the support in the immediate vicinity of the membrane ( the distributions are practically zero for the distances larger than 10@xmath2 m ) and this allows us to treat them as superficial distributions .",
    "our numerical application will reveal the dependence of the dielectric permittivity on the membrane electrical potential , mobility of the free distribution of charges and particle geometry .",
    "all these factors are equally important in the low range of frequency .",
    "it turns out that the consideration of non - spherical geometries ( especially non - convex geometries ) may play an important role in some situations .",
    "for example , if one wants to investigate the living cell cycles by dielectric measurements on synchronized cell suspensions , then definitely , near the subdivision point , the shape effects are considerable @xcite .",
    "we do nt know yet how to relate our results with the electrorotation theory @xcite or how to combine them .",
    "we consider that is premature to compare our theoretical results with the experimental results obtained by electrorotation , which , at this time , seems to be the only accurate experimental data in the low range of frequencies .",
    "this is mainly because of different regimes of the applied electric field and concentrations .",
    "from now , the perturbation of the external electric field ( which will be called the excitation ) , due to the presence of a particle , will be called the response of that particle to the excitation .",
    "it is known that the lorentz method of dielectric permittivity calculus works only if the response of the suspension constituents is linear in respect to the excitation .",
    "when diffusion effects are considered , this fact is no longer true .",
    "this is the reason we start our analysis with the response of a single particle to an external excitation .",
    "let us consider a particle with two dielectric phases ( shelled particle ) , placed in a spacial homogeneous and temporal oscillating electric field .",
    "in addition , we consider that we have a superficial charge distribution on the shell faces .",
    "laplace equation , satisfied by the electrical potential , has to be completed with the boundary conditions on the separation surfaces of the dielectric phases .",
    "these conditions will be deducted from charge conservation equation .",
    "if one considers a surface @xmath3 which separates two dielectric mediums , @xmath4 , with a free charge @xmath5 distributed on it , then the electrical current density is formed by a volume one , given by @xmath6 and a singular density , @xmath7 , having the support on the interface @xmath3 . denoting with @xmath8 the net charge concentration ( note that a part of charges are due to different conductivities @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , the continuity equation for a domain @xmath11 , centered on the surface , is @xmath12 where @xmath13 . using the maxwell equation , @xmath14 , it follows @xmath15 the singular current is the only cause of the superficial distribution variation @xmath16 finally , the passing equation of the electrical field , in the integral form , is @xmath17 and in the differential form is @xmath18 where @xmath19 represents the normal at the interface .",
    "for shelled particles , the complete system of equations will be @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 are the external respective the internal face of the shell and @xmath23 is the external field .",
    "the temporal fourier decomposition leads to the following form of the equations and boundary conditions : @xmath24 for @xmath25 , the equation @xmath26 imposes @xmath27 this means that for @xmath28 and @xmath25 , we obtain trivial boundary conditions .",
    "so the system has a trivial solution . for @xmath29",
    ", the above equation can not be written .",
    "it is being replaced with the condition @xmath30 where @xmath31 represent the total free charge distributed on the two interfaces .",
    "this leads to nontrivial boundary conditions and consequently to a nontrivial solution . in consequence ,",
    "the solution of the system has the following general form : @xmath32 the components @xmath33 and @xmath34 represent the solution of the system for zero external excitation and will represent the equilibrium of the system . the equilibrium will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the components @xmath35 and @xmath5 are solutions of the following system : @xmath36 where the pulsation of the excitation was re - denoted with @xmath37 . introducing the expression of the singular current @xmath38 and working with the complex electric permittivity @xmath39 , we can write @xmath40=-j\\omega \\rho _ { i}\\text { ; } % x\\in \\sigma _ { i } \\\\",
    "\\overset{\\rightarrow } { e}\\longrightarrow \\overset{\\rightarrow } { e_{0}}\\text { as } \\left| \\overset{\\rightarrow } { x}\\right| \\rightarrow \\infty \\text{. } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where the index @xmath3 means that the operators are calculated on the surface .",
    "the system is not linear , because the conductivities of the superficial charges , @xmath41 , depend on @xmath5",
    ". we will consider in the following that we are in the limit of weak external electric fields so we can consider that the conductivities of the free charges are given by the equilibrium configuration .",
    "thus the system becomes linear .",
    "now , the total electric field will be the sum of the electrical fields of the equilibrium configuration and of the perturbation , @xmath42 . in the weak fields approximation",
    ", the average on the different orientations of the particle leads to the following value of the electric field inside of the particle : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the electric field ( only the perturbation part ) inside of the particle , when the external electric field , @xmath45 , is of norm one .",
    "further , this average can be calculate with the formula @xmath46 where @xmath47 designates three orthogonal directions .",
    "the average electric field is proportional with the excitation .",
    "this allows us to use the lorenz formula @xmath48 for the suspension dielectric permittivity calculus . here",
    "@xmath49 is the volume concentration of the suspension and @xmath0 is the polarization of the particles @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the particle volume , @xmath52 is the dielectric permittivity of the exterior medium and @xmath53 is the dielectric permittivity of the particle .",
    "in the following the primitivities and the conductivities will be denoted by : @xmath54 , @xmath55 for the exterior , @xmath56 , @xmath57 for the membrane , @xmath58 , @xmath59 for the interior .",
    "the system which establish the equilibrium configuration is obtained from the general system by cancelling the temporal derivatives : @xmath60 if we consider the conductivity of the membrane , @xmath61 , equal with zero , we obtain trivial neumann condition for the electric potential , inside and outside of the particle .",
    "this imposes constant electrical potential in the two regions .",
    "the distribution of charges on the two interfaces , @xmath62 , can be calculated by applying the gauss law : @xmath63 where @xmath64 includes both , the free charge @xmath5 and the charges which are accumulated on the interfaces due to the conduction currents .",
    "the equations for free charges are @xmath65=0\\longrightarrow d\\delta \\rho _ { 0_{i}}=0\\longleftrightarrow \\rho _ { 0_{i}}=const.\\text{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the tangent electric field to @xmath67 .",
    "the link between @xmath34 and @xmath68 results by the reason that the inside region is not an electric charges reservoir , which means that the total charge on the interfaces is given only by the free charges .",
    "thus @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the electric potential difference between the two surfaces ( membrane potential ) and @xmath71 is the capacity of a condenser having the geometry of the shell and dielectric permittivity equal with @xmath72 .",
    "the values of the @xmath73 fix the electric conductivity on the two interfaces @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 are the charge mobilities on the two interfaces .",
    "it was seen that , in the calculus of the dielectric permittivity , only the perturbation part of the electric field is important .",
    "so the only influence of the membrane electric potential on the dispersions curves of the dielectric permittivity comes from the above formula .",
    "the charges on the second interface lie behind the shell , so the external electric field will have a smaller influence on them than on the charges of the first interface . in the same time , it is an experimental fact that the mobility of the inside charges is much smaller than that of external charges .",
    "both reasons justify the idea of considering the free charges of the inside interface to be fixed ( i.e. zero mobility ) . with this simplification ,",
    "the value of @xmath78 is fixed at the equilibrium value .",
    "now we have inhomogeneous particles with free electric charges only on their surface .",
    "let us consider first the situation of a homogeneous particle , with dielectric permittivity @xmath53 and conductivity @xmath79 , placed in the electric field @xmath80 .",
    "if we use the expression of the simple layer for the electric potential @xmath81 the passing equation for the electric field through the surface of the particle , @xmath3 , becomes the following integral equation for the charge distribution @xmath82 : @xmath83(\\overset{% \\rightarrow } { x})=\\overset{\\rightarrow } { n}\\cdot \\overset{\\rightarrow } { e_{0}% } \\text{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 and @xmath85 is the operator @xmath86 \\left ( \\overset{\\rightarrow } { x}\\right ) = \\frac{1}{% 4\\pi } \\underset{y\\in \\sigma } { \\cdot \\int } \\frac{(\\overset{\\rightarrow } { x}-% \\overset{\\rightarrow } { y})\\cdot \\overset{\\rightarrow } { n_{x}}}{\\left|   \\overset{\\rightarrow } { x}-\\overset{\\rightarrow } { y}\\right| ^{3}}\\mu ( % \\overset{\\rightarrow } { y})ds_{y}\\text{.}\\ ] ] using the spectral decomposition of the @xmath85 operator , the solution of this equation is @xmath87\\text{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the spectral projector corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath89 .",
    "the @xmath85 operator is not a symmetric one , so some precautions are needed . about this operator and the validity of the above decomposition",
    ", one can consult @xcite .",
    "let us consider now the shelled particle placed in the same electric field .",
    "we consider here that the external surface of the shell is obtained by expanding the internal surfaces by a factor @xmath90 .",
    "the equivalence problem between this inhomogeneous dielectric particle and a homogeneous one can be formulated in the following terms : there exists a distribution of charges only on the external surface of the shell , @xmath91 , which provides the true electric field outside of particle . in the dipole approximation , this distribution is given by the following expression : @xmath92\\text{.}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 are given by : @xmath94 comparing with the formula for the homogeneous particle , we conclude that the shelled particle is equivalent to a homogeneous particle which has the same geometry and volume .",
    "the equivalation relation is given by @xmath95 in the particular case of the sphere , the above formula is identical to the existent formula @xcite .",
    "we will give in the following a sketch of the proof .",

    "the exact formula of @xmath0 must be completed with the term which comes from @xmath116@xmath147 as we already discussed , the last term is practically zero at high frequencies and becomes dominant at low frequencies .",
    "first , we will present our method of solving the complicated equation ( 41 ) of @xmath116 . here",
    ", the principal problem is the calculation of the spectral projectors of @xmath85 and @xmath111 operators .",
    "let us suppose that our surface is given in the spherical coordinates by @xmath148 . to solve the problem for the @xmath85 operator , we will choose the following orthonormal basis in @xmath149 : @xmath150 where @xmath151 represents the spherical harmonics and @xmath152 .",
    "the first step is the calculation of the matrix elements of the operator @xmath85 .",
    "then , taking acceptable truncated matrices , we will calculate the approximative spectrum .",
    "the approximative projectors will be given by @xmath153 , where @xmath154 are the polynomials which satisfy @xmath155 for each eigenvalue @xmath156 .",
    "for the operator @xmath111 , we have followed the way presented in @xcite .",
    "we have chosen the surfaces of figure 1 for our numerical application .",
    "as we already emphasized , @xmath157 is proportional with the electrical potential of the membrane and the mobility of the free charges . because the diffusion constant is also proportional with the superficial charge mobility , the quantity @xmath158 is proportional only to the membrane electrical potential .",
    "we will choose different values for the diffusion coefficient , @xmath159 , and for the ratio @xmath158 , which will give us the dependance of the dispersion curves on the mobility of free charges and membrane electrical potential .",
    "because the @xmath0 effect on the conductivity is much smaller than on the dielectric constant , we are enforced to consider two different values of the parameters : one for which one can see in detail the behavior of dielectric constant and one for which one can see in detail the behavior of conductivity .",
    "the results are presented in figures 2 - 13 .",
    "the following parameters were kept constant in our numerical analysis to the following values ( the units are in s.i ) : @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 .",
    "we want to point out first the relation of our results with the existent results . in the @xmath1-dispersion range of frequencies , the importance of @xmath168 operator , in this type of analysis , was pointed out in @xcite .",
    "basically , this method reduces the original equations of the electric field to surface equations .",
    "mathematically , this means that it transforms a problem involving unbounded operators ( laplace operator corresponding to certain boundary conditions ) to a problem involving compact operators ( the operator @xmath85 ) . here and in @xcite",
    "it is given a semi - empirical justification of the formulas ( 28 ) but , unfortunately , the formula of polarization is not exact .",
    "our paper states in very precise terms what equivalation means , proves rigorously the formulas ( 28 ) and that of polarization .",
    "another result directly related with our approach would be @xcite , where the method of equivalation is discussed .",
    "note that this result ( and the method itself ) depends on very particular surfaces considered there . in the @xmath0-dispersion range of frequencies",
    ", there are some results for the case of spherical geometry @xcite ( and what follows after ) but , as is stated in the beginnig of this paper , the results are valid only in a quasi - statical regime .",
    "one can see that , in the limit of zero diffusion constants , its passing equations does not reduce to the usual equation , but rather to two separate equations : one for conduction current and one for displacement current .",
    "in fact , this was our reason for we have treated very carefully the introductory sections .    in conclusion",
    ", this approach gives a unitary treatment of @xmath0 and @xmath169-dispersion in the general context of arbitrary geometries . in the @xmath169-dispersion range of frequency ,",
    "our paper corrects and puts some existent results in rigorous settings . in the @xmath0 range , it proposes a completely new approach which allows us to avoid problems like that mentioned before .",
    "also , it proves the general formula of polarization which includes the effects of the free charges .",
    "our model reproduces , qualitatively , the dielectric behavior of living cell suspensions in both @xmath170 and @xmath1 frequencies ranges and is flexible enough to reproduce any given curve which has this shape .",
    "the numerical application shows a very strong dependency of the dielectric dispersion curves on the membrane electrical potential .",
    "this fact anticipates the possibility of the experimental measurement of the membrane electrical potential by a simple measurement of the dielectric permittivity . besides this important cell parameter",
    ", one can measure the mobility of the free charges and , as in @xcite , the volume concentration of the suspension .",
    "we emphasize that this method is a non - destructive and can be a very fast one ( a discussion about this can be found in @xcite ) .",
