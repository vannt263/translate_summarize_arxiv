    "the statistics of rare or extreme events in a spatially extended system such as a fluctuating interface has attracted considerable recent interest .",

    "some of these theoretical predictions have been recently verified in experimental systems of monatomic steps on vicinal surfaces  @xcite .",
    "another example involves the study of extremal fourier intensities for gaussian interfaces  @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the statistics of yet another extreme observable that has generated considerable recent interest  @xcite , namely the statistics of the globally maximal relative height ( mrh ) ( relative height refers to the height of the interface measured relative to the spatially averaged height in a finite system ) in fluctuating interfaces in its steady state in a finite size system .    the statistics of mrh in fluctuating interfaces has important theoretical consequences .",
    "it turns out that even in cases where the steady state of the interface may be simple , such as in a gaussian interface , analytical calculation of the probability distribution of the mrh is nontrivial due to the presence of strong correlations between the heights at different points of the interface  @xcite .",
    "while the extreme value statistics of a set of independent or uncorrelated random variables is relatively easy to study and well understood along with a complete classification of different universality classes  @xcite , much less is known when the random variables are strongly correlated  @xcite , as in the case of interfaces . in particular , understanding the issue of universality of the extreme statistics in such a correlated system is a challenging problem to which we focus in this paper .",
    "one of the simplest examples of a fluctuating interface is provided by the @xmath8-dimensional edwards - wilkinson equation  @xcite where the height @xmath9 evolves via a diffusion equation in presence of an additive thermal noise . in the long time limit ,",
    "the system reaches a steady state which is well known  @xcite to have the gibbs - boltzmann form , @xmath10 $ ] , with a simple gaussian hamiltonian @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the height of the interface and @xmath2 is the linear size of the substrate .",
    "experimental realizations of such a simple gaussian @xmath8-dimensional interface in thermal equilibrium are provided by thermally fluctuating step edges on crystals with attachment / detachment dynamics of adatoms  @xcite . for periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) @xmath13 , the process @xmath12 defined by the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ st1 ] ) is just a brownian bridge .",
    "this hamiltonian has a zero mode since it is invariant under @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a constant .",
    "this is expected since this hamiltonian does not fix the absolute height @xmath16 of the system .",
    "therefore , a more relevant and physically meaningful observable is the relative height , @xmath17 , measured with respect to the global spatial average .",
    "although the hamiltonian @xmath18 in eq . ( [ st1 ] ) retains the same structure in terms of the relative heights , @xmath19 , the relative heights @xmath20 s , by definition , satisfy a global constraint , @xmath21 .",
    "this constraint turns out to play a crucial role in determining the mrh distribution  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , it was demonstrated numerically that @xmath0 has a scaling form , @xmath27 .",

    "moreover , the scaling function @xmath5 was computed exactly  @xcite using path integral techniques and it was shown to be sensitive to the boundary conditions .",
    "for example , for the pbc , it was shown that the laplace transform of @xmath5 is given by  @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 s are the magnitudes of the zeros of the standard airy function @xmath32 on the negative real axis  @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 etc  @xcite . note that the function @xmath5 defined in eq .",
    "( [ lt1 ] ) can be interpreted as a normalized probability density function ( pdf ) since @xmath36 for all @xmath37 and it can be shown that @xmath38 .",
    "the function @xmath5 has the following asymptotic tails  @xcite @xmath39    remarkably , this function @xmath5 appeared before in a number of seemingly unrelated problems in computer science and graph theory and is known  @xcite as the airy distribution function ( not to be confused with the airy function @xmath40 itself ) . essentially the function @xmath5 describes the pdf of the area under a brownian excursion on an unit interval  @xcite .",
