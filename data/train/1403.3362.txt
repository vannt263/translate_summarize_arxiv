    "for more than three decades now , interest rate modelling has been developed notably , generating a wide range of approaches embodying different emphases ( see , e.g. , james & webber 2000 , cairns 2004 , brigo & mercuiro 2006 , filipovic 2009 , bjrk 2009 , carmona & tehranchi 2010 ) .",
    "one of the more recent approaches that has attracted some attention is based on the specification of the pricing kernel , from which interest rate dynamics are deduced .",
    "the main advantage of the pricing kernel methodology is that it allows a wide range of derivatives , across different asset classes , to be treated and priced in a consistent and transparent manner ( cf .",
    "cochrane 2005 ) .",
    "an early example is flesaker & hughston ( 1996 , 1997 , 1998 ) , who introduced an approach that incorporates interest rate positivity in a canonical way .",
    "extensions of the positive interest approach include rutkowski ( 1997 ) and jin & glasserman ( 2001 ) .",
    "also within the positive - interest context , rogers ( 1997 , 2004 ) developed a ` potential approach ' for the modelling of the pricing kernel , based on the observation that the pricing kernel belongs to a certain class of probabilistic potentials .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to develop a new class of interest - rate models , called ` coherent interest - rate models ' , within the pricing kernel formalism .",
    "coherent interest rate models emerge in the context of the wiener - chaos expansion for the pricing kernel , originally introduced by hughston & rafailidis ( 2004 ) who made the observation that the class of potentials adequate for the characterisation of the pricing kernel admits a representation in terms of the conditional variance of a certain random variable , and proposed the use of the wiener - ito chaos expansion to model and calibrate the underlying random variable .",
    "the chaotic approach to interest - rate modelling was extended further in brody & hughston ( 2004 ) , where the most general forms of positive - interest arbitrage - free term - structure dynamics , within the context of brownian filtration , are obtained by exploiting calculus on function spaces .",
    "see also grasselli & hurd ( 2005 ) and grasselli & tsujimoto ( 2011 ) for further important contributions in the ` chaotoc ' approach to interest rate modelling .    in the present paper , we shall extend the chaos - based models for the pricing kernel in two distinct ways : ( a ) by working out the general representations for the chaos models at each chaos order ; and ( b ) by introducing finite - dimensional realisations of chaos models based on function spaces .",
    "with these objectives in mind , the paper is organised as follows . in sections [ sec:2][sec:4 ] we shall briefly review the background material for the benefit of readers less acquainted with the material , so as to make the present paper reasonably self - contained . specifically , in section  [ sec:2 ] we give a brief description of the pricing kernel and its role in financial modelling , based on the axiomatic framework of hughston & rafailidis ( 2004 ) .",
    "section  [ sec:3 ] summarises the argument leading to the conditional variance representation of hughston & rafailidis ( 2004 ) ( see also bjrk 2007 ) and the associated chaos expansion for calibration . in section  [ sec:4 ]",
    "we explain the definition of the coherent chaos representation introduced in brody & hughston ( 2004 ) , and its role in interest - rate modelling .    in section  [ sec:5 ]",
    "we introduce the notion of an @xmath1-order coherent chaos model , and derive the general representation for the pricing kernel , the short rate , the bond price , and the risk premium in this model .",
    "explicit examples of derivative pricing formulae are then obtained in section  [ sec:6 ] for coherent interest rate models .",
    "specifically , bond option and swaption prices are obtained in closed form .",
    "coherent chaos models are important because they form the building block for general interest rate models .",
    "specifically , a generic interest rate model can be expressed in the form of a linear superposition of the underlying coherent components ( in the sense explained in section  [ sec:4 ] ) , and thus are incoherent . by exploiting the linearity structure",
    "we are able to derive a generic expression in section  [ sec:7 ] for the pricing kernel for @xmath1-order incoherent chaos models .",
    "in section  [ sec:8 ] we shift the gear slightly by investigating finite - dimensional realisations of the coherent chaos models .",
    "we note that a chaos coefficient is given by an element of an infinite - dimensional hilbert space of square - integrable functions . when this coefficient is replaced by the square - root of a _",
    "finite _ number of dirac delta functions , then the resulting system can in effect be treated in a finite - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the corresponding interest rate models are ` simple ' in the sense that the pricing kernel and the bond price processes are given by piecewise step functions , where step sizes are sampled from nonlinear functions of independent gaussian random variables .",
    "the idea of the finite - dimensional realisation example is that it can be used to fit a finite - number of initial bond prices , without relying on interpolation methods .",
    "although the resulting models are rather elementary , we found them to be nevertheless of some interests .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec:9 ] with a brief discussion and further comments .",
    "the pricing kernel approach to valuation and risk management provides perhaps the most direct route towards deriving various familiar results in financial modelling .",
    "it also provides an insight into understanding the relation between risk , risk aversion , and return arising from risky investments when asset prices can jump  an idea that is perhaps difficult to grasp from other approaches available ( brody _ et al_. 2012 ) . for these reasons here we shall adapt the pricing kernel approach to interest rate modelling .",
    "we shall begin in this section with a brief review of the idea of a pricing kernel .",
    "in particular , we find it convenient to follow the axiomatic approach introduced in hughston & rafailidis ( 2004 ) .",
    "the axioms listed below are neither minimum nor unique ( see also brody & hughston 2004 , rogers 2004 , hughston & mina 2012 ) , however , we find that the approach taken in hughston & rafailidis ( 2004 ) leads to the desired representation of the pricing kernel needed for our purpose in the most expedient manner , and thus we shall take this as our starting point .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "we model the economy with a fixed probability space @xmath2 , where the probability measure @xmath3 is the physical probability measure .",
    "we equip this space with the standard augmented filtration @xmath4 generated by a system of one or more independent wiener processes @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "we also assume that asset prices are continuous semimartingales on @xmath7 , which will enable us to utilise various standard results of stochastic calculus . with this setup in mind , hughston & rafailidis ( 2004 )",
    "characterises the absence of arbitrage in the economy by assuming the existence of a pricing kernel , a strictly positive ito process @xmath8 on @xmath7 , such that the following set of axioms hold :    * there exists a strictly increasing absolutely continuous asset with price process @xmath9 that represents the money market account . *",
    "given any asset with price process @xmath10 and with @xmath11-adapted dividend rate process @xmath12 , the process @xmath13 defined by @xmath14 is a @xmath15-martingale .",
    "* there exists an asset  a floating rate note  that offers a continuous dividend rate such that its value remains constant over time .",
    "* there exists a system of discount bonds @xmath16 with the transversal property that @xmath17    from axiom ( a ) , we deduce the existence of an @xmath11-adapted short rate process @xmath18 such that @xmath19 for all @xmath20 and that @xmath21 since the money market account is an asset that pays no dividend , it follows from axiom ( b ) that the process @xmath22 defined by @xmath23 is a martingale .",
    "note that at most one process @xmath24 satisfying ( a ) and ( b ) can exist . due to the fact that @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 is also strictly positive for all @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , @xmath28 is a positive martingale and we can write @xmath29 for some @xmath11-adapted vector - valued process @xmath30 . here and in what follows , for simplicity of notation we shall write @xmath31 to denote the vector inner product @xmath32 . as a consequence of ( [ b sde ] ) , ( [ lambda ] ) , and ( [ lambda sde ] ) , the dynamical equation satisfied by the pricing kernel takes the form @xmath33 or equivalently we can write @xmath34 since the pricing kernel is a product of a martingale and a strictly decreasing process , it follows that @xmath35 is a supermartingale satisfying @xmath36\\leq\\pi_t$ ] .",
    "consider now a system of default - free discount ( zero coupon ) bonds .",
    "we assume , in accordance with axiom ( d ) , that the economy supports such a system of discount bonds over all time horizons .",
    "we write @xmath37 for the value at time @xmath38 of a default - free @xmath39-maturity discount bond that pays one unit of currency at maturity @xmath39 .",
    "since a discount bond pays no dividend , we deduce from axiom ( b ) that for each maturity @xmath39 the process @xmath40 is a martingale , which we shall denote by @xmath41 .",
    "it then follows from equation ( [ lambda ] ) that @xmath42 since @xmath43 is a parametric family of martingales , there exists a vector - valued family of processes @xmath44 such that we can write @xmath45 using ito s product and quotient rules , it follows from equations ( [ b sde ] ) , ( [ lambda sde ] ) , ( [ p = l over b ] ) and ( [ l sde ] ) that the dynamical equation satisfied by the discount - bond system is given by @xmath46 which can alternatively be written in the form @xmath47 we therefore recognise the process @xmath44 for a fixed @xmath39 as the @xmath39-maturity discount bond volatility , while @xmath48 measures the excess rate of return above the short rate arising from risky investments per volatility .",
    "as remarked above , the pricing kernel approach also provides an effective way for the valuation of a contingent claim .",
    "thus , for example , if @xmath49 is the payout of a derivative at time @xmath39 , then on account of axiom ( b ) we find that the value of the derivative at time @xmath38 is given by @xmath50}{\\pi_t } .",
    "\\label{eq:12 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in particular , for a unit cash flow @xmath51 we obtain the bond pricing formula @xmath52}{\\pi_t } .",
    "\\label{bond}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we now take the limit @xmath53 in ( [ bond ] ) , and make use of ( [ lim p ] ) , we find that @xmath54= 0 , \\quad \\mathbb{p } \\ ; \\mbox{- a.s.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this shows that the pricing kernel is a potential , i.e. a right - continuous positive supermartingale whose expectation value vanishes asymptotically as @xmath55 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath35 is a type - d potential ( in the language of meyer 1966 ) .",
    "this observation led rogers ( 1997 ) to introduce the so - called potential approach to interest rate modelling ( see also rogers 2004 , bjrk 2007 ) .",
    "the specification of @xmath35 therefore leads on the one hand to the bond price dynamics as well as the associated short rate process , while on the other hand to the pricing of general contingent claims .",
    "it is for these reasons that we prefer to model @xmath35 directly .",
    "one such approach , as indicated above , is to consider certain types of potentials for the basis of interest rate modelling ; another approach , which we shall consider here , is to employ the wiener chaos expansion technique to build interest rate models .",
    "to proceed we shall follow the observation made in hughston & rafailidis ( 2004 ) that the pricing kernel can be expressed in the form of a conditional variance of an @xmath56-measurable square - integrable random variable .",
    "the idea is as follows .",
    "we write ( [ pi sde ] ) in the integral form @xmath57 and take the @xmath58-conditional expectation on each side of ( [ eq:15 ] ) to obtain @xmath59 + { \\mathbb e}_t\\left [ \\int_t^t r_s \\pi_s { \\mbox{$\\rm d$}}s \\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq:16}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now taking the limit @xmath53 we deduce the following implicit relation for the pricing kernel : @xmath60.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that since @xmath35 and @xmath61 are both @xmath11-adapted , the vector valued process @xmath62 defined by the relation @xmath63 is also @xmath11-adapted . evidently , the vector @xmath64 for each @xmath65 is unique only up to so(@xmath66)-rotational degrees of freedom . for any given representative element @xmath67 of this equivalence class",
    "we define an @xmath58-martingale @xmath68 according to the following prescription : @xmath69 then we have @xmath70 from which , on account of the conditional wiener - ito isometry we deduce that @xmath71\\right)^2\\right ] .",
    "\\label{21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we shall refer to this identity as the conditional - variance representation for the pricing kernel .",
    "the foregoing analysis shows that to model the pricing kernel , it suffices to model the random variable @xmath72 that is an element of the hilbert space @xmath73 of square integrable random variables  more precisely , an element of the subspace of @xmath73 consisting of @xmath74-measurable random variables .",
    "the proposal of hughston & rafailidis ( 2004 ) is to employ the wiener chaos expansion to ` parameterise ' the random variable @xmath72 , work out the pricing kernel @xmath35 , and use the result to obtain pricing formulae for various derivatives ; which in turn allows one to calibrate the functional parameters in the chaos expansion .",
    "specifically , the random variable @xmath72 admits a unique expansion of the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 $ ] , @xmath77 is a square - integrable function of one variable , @xmath78 is a ( symmetric ) square - integrable function of two variables , and so on .",
    "we remark incidentally that the idea of a chaos expansion was introduced by wiener in his seminal paper titled `` homogeneous chaos '' ( wiener 1938 ) ; whereas the representation ( [ eq:22 ] ) in terms of the stochastic integral is due to ito ( 1951 ) .",
    "we refer to ikeda & watanabe ( 1989 ) , nualart ( 1995 ) , janson ( 1997 ) , malliavin ( 1997 ) , ksendal ( 1997 ) , and di  nunno _ et al_. ( 2009 ) for further discussion of the chaos expansion technique and its role in stochastic analysis .    for interest - rate modelling , therefore , we see that by substituting ( [ eq:22 ] ) in ( [ 21 ] ) , the pricing kernel is parameterised by a vector @xmath79 of a set of deterministic quantities : @xmath80 where @xmath79 is itself an element of a fock space @xmath81 of the direct sum of the hilbert spaces of square - integrable functions .",
    "the elements of @xmath79 are called the _ wiener chaos coefficients _ , or _",
    "wiener - ito chaos coefficients _ , and these coefficients fully characterise the information in @xmath72 . since @xmath72 determines the pricing kernel @xmath35 , which in turn determines the bond price process @xmath82 , each interest rate model can be viewed as depending on the specification of its wiener - ito chaos coefficients",
    "there is a special class of vectors in the fock space @xmath81 called ` coherent vectors ' that admit a number of desirable characteristics .",
    "let us consider the tensor product @xmath83 of @xmath0 copies of hilbert spaces .",
    "a generic element of @xmath84 may be written in the form @xmath85 ; whereas a coherent vector of @xmath81 is generated by a map from an element of @xmath86 to an element of @xmath84 .",
    "specifically , given @xmath87 , we consider an element of @xmath84 of the degenerate form @xmath88 the importance of coherent vectors is that the totality of such vectors in @xmath84 constitutes a resolution of the identity , i.e. these vectors are in general not orthogonal but nevertheless are complete .",
    "therefore , an arbitrary element of @xmath84 can be expressed in the form of a linear combination of ( possibly uncountably many ) coherent vectors .",
    "more generally , given an element @xmath89 we can generate a coherent fock vector of the form @xmath90 then an arbitrary element of @xmath81 can likewise be expressed as a linear combination of coherent vectors .",
    "the significance of the completeness of coherent vectors for the chaos expansion , noted in brody & hughston ( 2004 ) , is as follows .",
    "we observe first that if @xmath91 is coherent , then the associated random variable @xmath92 arising from the chaos expansion ( [ eq:22 ] ) takes the form @xmath93 where the @xmath94 term is assumed to be unity .",
    "we now make use of the following identity due to ito ( 1951 ) : @xmath95 where @xmath96 and where @xmath97 denotes the hermite polynomials , satisfying the generating function relation @xmath98 the role of hermite polynomials in relation to gaussian random variables is well known ( see , e.g. , schoutens 2000 ) . here",
    "we merely remark the property that if @xmath99 and @xmath100 are standard normal random variables , then @xmath101 = \\left(\\mathbb{e}[yz]\\right)^n \\ ; \\delta_{mn } ,    \\label{eq:31}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which follows from the fact that hermite polynomials are orthogonal with respect to the standard normal density function .    by comparing ( [ eq:27 ] ) and ( [ eq:30 ] )",
    "we thus deduce that @xmath102 on account of the completeness of the coherent vectors and linearity , therefore , it follows that an arbitrary @xmath56-measurable square - integrable random variable @xmath72 admits a simple representation @xmath103 where @xmath104 are constants satisfying @xmath105 , where @xmath106 for each @xmath107 is a deterministic square - integrable function , and where the summation in ( [ eq:33 ] ) is formal and may be replaced by an appropriate integration in the uncountable case",
    ". it should be evident that an analogous result holds more generally for an arbitrary @xmath58-measurable square - integrable random variable  that is , any such random variable can be expressed in terms of a linear combination of log - normally distributed random variables . putting the matter differently ,",
    "log - normal random variables are dense in the space of square - integrable random variables .",
    "this remarkable fact was applied in brody & hughston ( 2004 ) to identify the general expressions for the pricing kernel and other quantities ( such as the bond price , risk premium , and the various interest rates ) in the brownian - based setting , owing to the fact that the conditional variance of @xmath72 in ( [ eq:33 ] ) is easily calculated in closed form .",
    "the point of departure in the present investigation is to examine more closely the @xmath1-order chaos models for each @xmath0 .",
    "that is to say , we are concerned with interest - rate models that arise from the chaos expansion of the form @xmath108 for each @xmath0 , where @xmath109 . as indicated above",
    ", any such function @xmath110 can be expressed as a linear combination of ( possibly uncountable ) coherent functions of the form @xmath111 .",
    "our strategy therefore is to first work out the interest rate model arising from such a coherent element of @xmath84 , which we shall refer to as the @xmath1-order coherent chaos model , and then consider their linear combinations for more general @xmath1-order chaos models for the pricing kernel .",
    "to proceed , we recall that from ( [ eq:27 ] ) it follows that for a coherent element we have @xmath112 where we have written @xmath113 $ ] .",
    "note that the argument @xmath114 appearing here in the hermite polynomial is , for each @xmath38 , a standard normally distributed random variable ; hence on account of ( [ orth ] ) we find that the martingales @xmath115 are mutually orthogonal .",
    "this property will be exploited in a calculation below when we analyse the more general ` incoherent ' models .",
    "let us now turn to the determination of the pricing kernel : @xmath116 - \\left ( x_t^{(n)}\\right)^2 .",

    "+ _ example 1 _ : as an illustrative example , consider the case in which @xmath247 , and suppose that the chaos expansion involves the superposition of a pair of functions : @xmath248 in this case , after some elementary calculation , we obtain the following expression for the pricing kernel : @xmath249 here , we have written @xmath250 for the two gaussian processes .",
    "we see therefore that the pricing kernel in this case is a simple quadratic cross - polynomial of the two gaussian state variables @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",

    "in this section we consider the case in which the hilbert space of square - integrable functions is approximated by ( or replaced with ) a finite - dimensional hilbert space . to facilitate the calculation , we make use of the dirac delta function so that the function @xmath255 is given by the square root of a weighted sum of a finite number of delta functions .",
    "the idea of finite - dimensional realisations is to generate a set of models that can be calibrated purely in terms of a finite number of available market data , without evoking the assumption of hypothetical initial bond prices across all maturities that do not exist .    to proceed , we recall first that we have made the normalisation convention such that @xmath256 hence , @xmath257 can be interpreted as defining a probability density function , except that now in effect in a finite - dimensional space .",
    "more precisely , and strictly speaking , we continue to work in the infinite - dimensional hilbert space , but by facilitating a finite number of distributions rather than functions , the analysis in effect reduces to that based on a finite - dimensional hilbert space",

    "note that @xmath270 is not an expiry date , but rather an arbitrary time that is beyond the maturity date of the bond in the market with the longest lifetime .",
    "the choice of @xmath270 will not affect the valuation of contracts whose maturities are @xmath271 ; thus the analysis below will not be affected by the arbitrariness of the choice of @xmath270 .",
    "the reason for introducing @xmath270 is merely to fulfil the asymptotic condition ( [ lim p ] ) of axiom ( d ) in the finite - dimensional setup .",
    "conversely , had we not introduced @xmath270 , the discussion below would not be affected .",
    "let us now consider the @xmath1-order coherent chaos model associated with the positive square - root of ( [ eq:94 ] ) . a short calculation using expression ( [ q fdr ] ) in the result ( [ p0 t ] ) for @xmath272 shows that the corresponding initial bond prices with maturity @xmath38 admit the following representation : @xmath273     as a function of maturity time for @xmath247 .",
    "two bond prices are assumed given at times @xmath274 and @xmath275 ; while at time @xmath276 the bond price is assumed to jump to zero .",
    "the parameter values chosen here are @xmath277 , @xmath278 , and @xmath279 . ]    to illustrate the initial term structure in the present model we sketch in figure  [ fig:2 ] an example of the initial bond prices as a function of the maturity time for @xmath247 .",
    "three maturities have been used here : @xmath280 , @xmath281 and the ` artificially ' chosen @xmath276 . according to ( [ eq:96 ] )",
    "the initial value @xmath282 of a bond expiring at time @xmath283 ( where the first jump occurs ) is @xmath284 , the price at time @xmath285 is @xmath286 , and so on .",
    "hence in the pure second - order coherent chaos model with only two data points specified , we have the values @xmath287 , @xmath288 , and @xmath289 .    , its quadratic variation @xmath290 , and the resulting pricing kernel @xmath291 , in the case of a finite - dimensional coherent chaos model with @xmath247 .",
    "the parameters chosen here are @xmath292 and @xmath293 for @xmath294 , and @xmath295 with @xmath296 arbitrary . ]",
    "since it is assumed that the maturities @xmath261 are the points where we have market data for the bond prices , we see that the probability weights @xmath297 can be calibrated from the initial market prices of the discount bonds .",
    "this in turn determines the function @xmath126 , which in turn determines the subsequent dynamics for the term structure .",
    "let us proceed to analyse the term structure dynamics in the finite - dimensional models . to begin , recall that @xmath298 , so in order to determine the gaussian process @xmath130 whose probabilistic characteristics are identical to that of @xmath299 , where @xmath126 is of the form ( [ eq:94 ] ) , let us consider a family of independent gaussian random variables @xmath300 then we can represent the gaussian process @xmath130 according to @xmath301 where equality here holds of course in probability . by making use of ( [ eq:39 ] ) and ( [ eq:41 ] ) , the corresponding pricing kernel can be identified in the finite - dimensional models . in figure  [ fig:3 ]",
    "we illustrate typical sample paths of @xmath290 , @xmath130 , and @xmath302 for @xmath247 and @xmath303 . for simplicity we have chosen a uniform probability and equal spacing : @xmath304 and @xmath293 for @xmath305 .",
    "similarly , in figure  [ fig:4 ] , we show a sample path of a corresponding bond price process , where we have again chosen @xmath304 for @xmath306 with bond maturity @xmath178 .     in the coherent chaos model for order @xmath247 .",
    "the parameters chosen here as @xmath304 for @xmath307 , and the bond maturity is set as @xmath178 .",
    "the bond price fluctuates up and down , but eventually converges to its terminal value one .",
    "the prices jump at the points at which the initial bond prices are assumed given in accordance with ( [ eq:96 ] ) . ]    summing up the section , we see that using the finite - dimensional approach , a class of elementary , highly tractable and easily calibrated models can be constructed .",
    "these models have the characteristic feature that the discount bond process is piecewise flat and that the distribution of the bond price at any time is determined by a ratio of polynomials of standard normal random variables .",
    "the bond price processes emerging in these models can alternatively be viewed as representing ` simple ' approximations to more sophisticated continuous processes . to illustrate how a typical bond price in these models behaves , in figure  [ fig:5 ] we show an example of the bond price dynamics where the ` grid size ' is made ten times finer than the one sketched in figure  [ fig:4 ] .",
    "it is interesting to note in this connection that although the gaussian process @xmath308 formally appears to be continuous , owing to the appearance of distributions in ( [ eq:94 ] ) the resulting process contains jumps , as shown in figure  [ fig:3 ] .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to offer an in - depth analysis of the coherent chaos interest - rate models of each order with the view that they form the basis for generic ( incoherent ) interest - rate models .",
    "we have found that for a pure @xmath1 order coherent chaos model , the pricing kernel is given by a polynomial of order @xmath129 of a gaussian state variable .",
    "this leads to fairly simple expressions for the bond price , the risk premium , and the short rate processes .",
    "additionally , we have shown that in all these models it is possible to derive either analytic or semianalytic formulae for the pricing of both bond options and swaptions , involving at most numerical determination of roots of basic polynomials .     in the coherent chaos model for order @xmath247 .",
    "the parameters chosen here are @xmath309 for @xmath310 , and the bond maturity is set as @xmath178 .",
    "the bond price fluctuates up and down , but eventually converges to its terminal value one .",
    "the prices jump at the points at which the initial bond prices are assumed given in accordance with ( [ eq:96 ] ) . ]",
    "single - factor coherent chaos models , although are themselves considerably richer than elementary gaussian interest rate models , are nevertheless too restrictive on account of the fact that each coherent chaos model depends on just a single functional degree of freedom . for more realistic models , however , it suffices to take linear superpositions of coherent chaos elements in the sense described in section  [ sec:4 ] .",
    "the resulting expression for the pricing kernel , in the most generic case , is somewhat cumbersome , although is nevertheless tractable .",
    "however , for practical purposes it seems sufficient to consider just a small number of ( two or three ) coherent vectors so as to generate rich and flexible interest - rate models .",
    "we hope that the results presented here will form a foundation for further investigation into this direction .    by means of comparison , we draw attention to the fact that implementation of chaos models has recently been carried out in grasselli & tsujimoto ( 2011 ) in the case of a third - order chaos model , with the choices @xmath311 , @xmath312 , and @xmath313 . their model has been shown to fit the forward curve more closely , and with less parameters , as compared to currently preferred models employed in the industry .",
    "an interesting extension would therefore be to consider the implementation of the following generalisation : @xmath311 , @xmath314 , and @xmath315 , in line with the foregoing discussion , and examine how well the generalised model fits both the forward and volatility curves .",
    "in relation to the analysis on finite - dimensional models , it is worth making the following observation . for simplicity ,",
    "if we set @xmath316 , then formally we are led to an expression of the form @xmath317 for the gaussian process @xmath130 , the meaning of which _ a priori _ is not easily interpreted . in the present paper",
    "we have circumvented the direct handling of processes of the form ( [ eq:102 ] ) and its generalisations by means of identifying for each @xmath38 an alternative random variable whose probability law is identical to that of @xmath137 , and used this alternative representation to characterise interest - rate dynamics . for a more direct analysis of stochastic integrals of the form ( [ eq:102 ] ) , calculus on the multiplication of distributions due to colombeau ( 1990 ) might prove useful .",
