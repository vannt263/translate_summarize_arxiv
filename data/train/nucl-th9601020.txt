    "the neutron - halo structure has been observed systematically @xcite in light neutron - rich nuclei near the neutron drip - line .",
    "a large coulomb breakup cross section has been observed for the neutron - halo nucleus in reactions on a heavy target nucleus @xcite , which indicates that a significant amount of @xmath4 strength exists at low excitation energy region of the neutron - halo nucleus @xcite . since stable nuclei",
    "do not have such a strong @xmath4 distribution at low excitation energy , this unusual feature of the neutron - halo nucleus has attracted much attention .",
    "the origin of the strong @xmath4 distribution is still controversial : it may be a resonant character due to the vibration of the halo neutron against a core nucleus @xcite . or it may be understood from an analogy of the strong @xmath4 transitions known in @xmath5be , @xmath0be , and @xmath6c where a single nucleon is weakly coupled to a core nucleus @xcite . a recent argument suggests that the low - lying @xmath4 strength of the light halo nuclei is not considered the vibrational state @xcite .",
    "recent experiments of the coulomb breakup reactions , @xmath0li + @xmath1pb @xcite and @xmath0be + @xmath1pb @xcite , have observed a significant longitudinal momentum difference between the halo neutron(s ) and the core nucleus . the momentum difference has been explained in terms of the coulomb post - acceleration effect by assuming a direct breakup mechanism . in this mechanism",
    "the breakup is assumed to occur instantaneously at the closest approach point between the projectile and target nuclei .",
    "after the breakup of the projectile nucleus , the target coulomb field accelerates only the core nucleus , and causes the momentum difference between the neutron and the core nucleus .",
    "if the breakup proceeds through a resonant state of the projectile nucleus , the core nucleus and the halo neutron moves together during its lifetime and the post - acceleration effect should become small .",
    "the observation of the longitudinal velocity difference is thus recognized as a direct evidence for the non - resonant character of the @xmath4 strength at low excitation energy .",
    "the post - acceleration effect is not explained in the lowest order perturbation treatment of the coulomb excitation .",
    "the evaluation of higher order effects is not easy because the final states involve continuum states .",
    "several theoretical approaches have been proposed to understand the post - acceleration effect , including a classical treatment of the breakup reaction @xcite , a distorted - wave born approach @xcite , a simplified treatment of the higher order perturbations @xcite , and a coupled - channel approach with discretized continuum states @xcite .",
    "contrary to these approaches , some groups have investigated the time evolution of the projectile nucleus by solving a time - dependent schrdinger equation on mesh points of space and time variables @xcite .    in our previous paper",
    "@xcite we studied the coulomb breakup of @xmath0be and found large transverse and small longitudinal momentum differences between the neutron and the @xmath7be nucleus .",
    "the result was understood in the picture of free - particle breakup mechanism which is in contrast to the direct breakup mechanism .",
    "however , the reproduction of the experimental momentum difference remained to be an open problem . in this paper",
    "we extend the previous calculation to a more realistic case by including the spin - orbit interaction between the neutron and the core nucleus .",
    "a full three - dimensional dynamical calculation has also been done in [ 13b ] assuming a simple internal hamiltonian .",
    "no investigation has , however , so far been performed to clarify the roles of the @xmath8 potential and the level structure of excited states .",
    "we first analyze the mechanism of the coulomb breakup quantum - mechanically for various cases of the neutron - core hamiltonian .",
    "the results are discussed in comparison with the intuitive arguments based on the classical mechanics .",
    "the usefulness and limitation of the classical arguments is made clear .",
    "we then analyze the coulomb breakup reaction of @xmath0be + @xmath1pb @xcite with a realistic choice of the potential between the halo neutron and @xmath7be .",
    "we show that the breakup mechanism is sensitive to the structure of the excited states of the projectile and that the inclusion of the spin - orbit interaction is very important to reproduce the observed features quantitatively .    in section 2",
    "we formulate the quantum - mechanical treatment of the coulomb breakup reaction using the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "the method of calculating the time evolution of the wave function is briefly explained . in section 3",
    "the theory is applied to various cases of the halo nucleus to discuss the limitation of the classical arguments for the coulomb breakup reaction and to reveal the characteristics of the quantum aspect .",
    "the coulomb breakup of @xmath0be on a @xmath1pb target is analyzed in section 4 .",
    "a brief summary is given in section 5 .",
    "we consider the coulomb breakup reaction of the nucleus with neutron - halo structure .",
    "the projectile of the halo nucleus is assumed to consist of a single neutron and a core nucleus .",
    "the core nucleus is treated as a structureless particle and binds the neutron weakly by an appropriate potential .",
    "we describe the reaction in the projectile rest frame where the center - of - mass of the projectile is put at the origin of the coordinate .",
    "the time development of the wave function , @xmath9 , of the relative motion between the neutron and the core nucleus is described by the following time - dependent schrdinger equation , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the internal hamiltonian describing the relative motion between the halo neutron and the core nucleus .",
    "we assume that the projectile moves along a straight line trajectory with a constant velocity .",
    "the target nucleus exerts a coulomb potential @xmath12 on the projectile .",
    "the potential is treated as a time - dependent external field in the projectile rest frame , @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the impact parameter which specifies the straight line trajectory , @xmath15 is the incident velocity of the projectile , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the charge numbers of the target and core nucleus , respectively .",
    "the masses of the neutron and the core nucleus are denoted by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the wave function is expanded in partial waves as @xmath20 when the internal hamiltonian @xmath21 includes the spin - orbit interaction , it is convenient to couple the spin of the neutron with the relative orbital angular momentum @xmath22 to the total angular momentum @xmath23 . since the generalization to such",
    "a case is straightforward , we develop the formulation by assuming the wave function of eq.(3 ) .",
    "we descretize the time variable in a step @xmath24 , and represent the wave function of @xmath25-th time step as @xmath26 .",
    "the wave function of @xmath27-th time step is calculated by the following formula , @xmath28 the radial part of the wave function of @xmath25-th step is denoted as @xmath29 .",
    "the time development is then achieved by two successive procedures .",
    "first , the development due to the external field @xmath12 is approximated by @xmath30 the evaluation of the matrix element in eq .",
    "( 5 ) is done by expanding the external field into multipoles .",
    "next the time development by the internal hamiltonian is performed separately for each angular momentum channel , @xmath31 , by using the following approximation @xmath32 with @xmath33 to obtain @xmath34 from @xmath35 , we discretize the radius variable @xmath36 on mesh points of an equal spacing and employ the crank - nicolson formula @xcite using three - point formula for the second order differential operator .    the time evolution is calculated according to the above prescription from an initial wave function , @xmath37 , which is the ground - state wave function of the internal hamiltonian .",
    "the breakup component of the wave function is obtained by eliminating all the bound state components of the hamiltonian , @xmath38 here the subscript @xmath14 is kept to stress that the time evolution of the wave function is calculated for each impact parameter of the external field .",
    "the momentum distribution of the relative motion between the neutron and the core nucleus after the breakup is obtained by @xmath39 where @xmath40 represents the plane wave state .",
    "the integration of eq .",
    "( 9 ) over @xmath41 yields the coulomb breakup probability , @xmath42 , for a given @xmath43 . integrating @xmath44 over the impact parameter vector yields the total coulomb breakup cross section .",
    "the breakup cross section can be expressed as a function of the relative motion energy @xmath45 between the neutron and the core nucleus as follows , @xmath46 where @xmath47 . the convergence of the integral in eq .",
    "( 10 ) is very slow with respect to the impact parameter .",
    "furthermore the calculation of the relative momentum distribution requires a long time step for large impact parameters . to circumvent this difficulty",
    ", we divide the integration interval of @xmath48 to two parts , @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath50 $ ] , and in the latter interval employ the first order perturbation theory to calculate the energy distribution .",
    "the value of @xmath51 is chosen in such a way that the first order perturbation theory ( pt ) and the time - dependent calculation ( td ) give approximately the same energy distribution at @xmath52 .",
    "equation ( 10 ) is then recast to @xmath53 the second term of eq .",
    "( 11 ) is expressed in a closed form by using the perturbation theory .",
    "for this aim we use the breakup probability distribution which is obtained in the first order perturbation theory , @xmath54{d{b}(e1 ) \\over d{e}},\\ ] ] where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the modified bessel functions and @xmath57 . by integrating eq .",
    "( 12 ) over the impact parameter in the interval @xmath50 $ ] , we obtain @xmath58 where @xmath59 .    the @xmath60 strength function in eqs .",
    "( 12 ) and ( 13 ) is defined by @xmath61 with the dipole operator @xmath62 defined by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the mass number of the core nucleus .",
    "the wave functions @xmath65 and @xmath66 of eq .",
    "( 14 ) are the bound excited states and continuum states of the hamiltonian @xmath21 and @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the corresponding eigenvalues , respectively . to calculate the @xmath60 strength function we rewrite eq .",
    "( 14 ) in a time - dependent form , @xmath69 where the ground state is assumed to have @xmath70 .",
    "the wave function @xmath71 satisfies the time - dependent schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian @xmath21 and its initial wave function @xmath72 is equal to @xmath73 . by solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation without an external field , it is possible to obtain the wave function @xmath74 and then calculate the @xmath60 strength function according to eq .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize eq .",
    "( 16 ) to the case where the spin - orbit potential is included .",
    "to elucidate the breakup mechanism of a neutron - halo nucleus , we investigate the breakup process for various choices of the internal hamiltonian @xmath21 . before showing calculated results ,",
    "we first discuss typical intuitive pictures for the breakup mechanism based on the classical mechanics .",
    "they include :      in the direct breakup mechanism , the neutron is assumed to be removed suddenly from the core nucleus when the projectile nucleus approaches the point closest to the target nucleus . after the breakup occurs ,",
    "only the core nucleus is accelerated by the target coulomb field .",
    "the relative momentum between the neutron and the core nucleus is finite both for the longitudinal and transverse directions .",
    "when the projectile nucleus has such a resonance state that can be excited from the ground state by the target coulomb field , the resonant breakup process may become important and the breakup may proceed dominantly by way of the resonance . if the lifetime of the resonance is long enough , the neutron and the core nucleus would move together for a long time before the breakup occurs . in such an extreme case",
    "there is no difference in the relative momentum between the neutron and the core nucleus . in the last case of free - particle breakup mechanism we consider the limiting case where the binding energy of the neutron is extremely small .",
    "then the neutron and the core nucleus behave independently during the reaction .",
    "the core nucleus moves along the rutherford trajectory , while the halo neutron , receiving no coulomb force from the target , moves on the straight line . in the end",
    "the core nucleus receives the momentum only in the transverse direction .",
    "the momentum difference between the neutron and the core nucleus arises only in the transverse direction .",
    "table i summarizes the momentum differences for the three cases discussed above .",
    "it is not clear how well the above classical arguments are quantitatively correct , though they are easily accepted intuitively . in what follows",
    "we show results of the quantum - mechanical calculations for various cases of the neutron - core interactions for which the above - mentioned reaction mechanisms are expected to be manifest .",
    "we choose various parameters for the study of the breakup reaction of @xmath0be on a @xmath1pb nucleus performed at the incident energy of 72 mev / nucleon @xcite .",
    "hence the projectile nucleus of @xmath0be has the incident velocity of @xmath75 . by choosing the reaction plane to be @xmath76-@xmath77 plane , the target nucleus moves on the straight line @xmath78 in the projectile rest frame .",
    "the impact parameter @xmath48 is fixed to @xmath79 fm in the present section .",
    "the radius variable @xmath36 is taken up to 800 fm and it is descretized with the mesh size of @xmath80 fm .",
    "the time step @xmath81 mev@xmath82 is used for calculating the time development of the wave function .",
    "the schrdinger equation is solved for the time interval of @xmath83 mev@xmath82 . at the initial and final stages of the calculation ,",
    "the target nucleus is apart from the projectile s center - of - mass coordinate by about 750 fm in the longitudinal direction .",
    "we assume that the @xmath84 ground state of the @xmath0be nucleus is described with a single neutron - halo structure in the @xmath85 orbit around the inert @xmath7be core .",
    "the potential between the neutron and the core nucleus is taken to be a spherical woods - saxon potential .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction is turned off in the calculation presented in this section .",
    "the radius and diffuseness parameters of the potential are fixed to @xmath86 fm and @xmath87 fm , whereas the depth of the potential is treated as a variable parameter to investigate the breakup mechanism .",
    "the partial waves up to @xmath88 are included in the expansion of eq .",
    "the contribution of higher partial waves is found to be negligible .",
    "the target coulomb field of eq .",
    "( 2 ) is expanded in multipoles around the projectile s center - of - mass , and the dipole and quadrupole multipoles are included in the calculation .",
    "the dipole field plays a dominant role in the present system .",
    "the contribution of the quadrupole field is found to be small .",
    "the average value of the relative momentum between the neutron and the core nucleus is calculated by the following formula @xmath89 similarly the average values of the longitudinal and transverse momentum differences , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , are defined by the breakup component @xmath92 .",
    "we use the convention that the longitudinal and transverse directions indicate the @xmath77 and @xmath76 directions , respectively .      to discuss the validity of the classical arguments summarized in table i ,",
    "we first show the result of calculation obtained by changing the neutron - core potential depth @xmath93 of @xmath70 channel .",
    "the value of @xmath93 is varied to understand the dependence of the breakup reaction mechanism on the binding energy of the halo neutron of the @xmath85 orbit .",
    "the potential depth of other channels , denoted @xmath94 , is set the same as @xmath93 .",
    "the @xmath95 orbit is always bound below the @xmath85 orbit , and there is no resonant nor bound excited state which can be excited from the ground state by the dipole field .",
    "the halo nucleus considered in this subsection is thus a very simple system , and excited to the continuum directly by the coulomb field .",
    "figure 1 displays the magnitude of @xmath90 and @xmath96 values as a function of @xmath93",
    ". the lower part of fig .",
    "1 shows the binding energy of the @xmath85 orbit .",
    "as the binding becomes weaker , the longitudinal momentum difference decreases and approaches zero in the vanishing binding energy , while the transverse momentum difference increases slightly .",
    "this result is consistent with the free - particle breakup picture .",
    "however , the transverse relative momentum is always smaller than the value , @xmath97 fm@xmath82 , which is expected from the classical argument . on the other hand , in the strong binding case , both of the longitudinal and transverse momentum differences are finite and close to the value of @xmath99 fm@xmath82 , which is just expected from the direct breakup picture . these calculations including both weak and strong binding cases indicate that the breakup mechanism of the neutron - halo nucleus , whose binding energy is typically less than 1 mev , proceeds between the two mechanisms of the direct and free - particle breakup .",
    "the free - particle picture becomes more suitable with the decreasing binding energy of the halo neutron .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "2 the @xmath60 strength as a function of the neutron - core relative energy . the value of @xmath100 of eq . ( 16 ) is set 0.01 mev",
    ". the @xmath60 strength function is closely related to the energy spectrum of the breakup cross section ( see eq.(13 ) ) .",
    "the non - perturbative effect gives only a small effect on the energy spectrum of the cross section [ 14,13b ] .",
    "the @xmath60 strength is shown for two cases of the ground - state energy : @xmath101 mev ( @xmath102 mev ) , and @xmath103 mev ( @xmath104 mev ) .",
    "the latter value is chosen to fit the empirical neutron separation energy of @xmath0be .",
    "no resonance exists in @xmath105-wave for both cases .",
    "therefore the peak in the @xmath60 strength which appears at low excitation energy in case of @xmath103 mev has nothing to do with any resonant character .",
    "we see that the energy spectrum of the @xmath60 strength is very sensitive to the neutron binding energy .",
    "since the breakup probability is sensitive to the @xmath4 strength at low excitation energy , the breakup cross section is also sensitive to the neutron binding energy .",
    "here we investigate how the breakup mechanism depends on the structure of the excited states of the halo nucleus .",
    "for this purpose we employ the angular momentum ( @xmath22- ) dependent neutron - core potential .",
    "the potential depth of @xmath70 channel is fixed to @xmath104 mev in order to fit the energy of the @xmath85 orbit to @xmath106 mev , the ground - state energy of @xmath0be from the @xmath107be threshold .",
    "the value of @xmath94 is now treated as a variable parameter . as shown in the lower part of fig .",
    "3 , there is a bound @xmath95 state when @xmath108 mev . in case of @xmath10933.2 mev @xmath110 mev",
    ", the bound @xmath95 state appears between the @xmath85 ground state and the neutron threshold .",
    "this @xmath95 state is excited by the dipole field in the breakup reaction . in case of @xmath11131.3 mev",
    "@xmath112 mev a @xmath105-wave resonance with a long lifetime appears in the continuum .",
    "figure 3 plots the average relative momentum as a function of @xmath94 .",
    "as expected , when the resonance state exists both of the average relative momenta in the longitudinal and transverse directions are very small .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the transverse momentum remains finite even when the resonance energy is very close to zero and thus its lifetime becomes very long .",
    "this indicates that the resonant breakup mechanism is too much oversimplified .",
    "when the potential depth is deep enough to have a bound excited state , the average relative momentum shows quite different behaviour between the longitudinal and transverse directions .",
    "the longitudinal momentum difference is still very small and changes continuously from the case where the excited state is the resonance .",
    "in contrast with this the transverse momentum difference increases discontinuously from the resonance case .",
    "these results of small longitudinal and large transverse relative momenta might suggest that the breakup proceeds through the free - particle breakup mechanism in this case .",
    "there is , however , no physical reason that the free - particle breakup mechanism is correct .",
    "this is because two breakup processes occur when there is a bound excited state : one is the direct breakup to the continuum .",
    "the other is the breakup via the bound excited state .",
    "the latter process apparently does not fit in with the free - particle breakup mechanism . at present",
    "we do not have a simple explanation for the discontinuous change in the transverse momentum difference and the continuous behaviour in the longitudinal momentum difference which show up when the excited @xmath95 orbit crosses the threshold . when the @xmath95 orbit is bound more deeply ( @xmath113 mev ) , or is in the nonresonant continuum ( @xmath114 mev ) , the momentum differences become similar to those of the previous subsection ( @xmath115 mev , see fig .",
    "1 ) , that is , @xmath116 fm@xmath82 and @xmath117 fm@xmath82 , and are rather insensitive to the potential depth .",
    "the @xmath60 strength function is compared in fig . 4 for two choices of @xmath94 : one is @xmath94=@xmath118 mev where the @xmath95 resonance appears at about 0.2 mev . the other is @xmath119 mev which locates the @xmath95 excited state at @xmath45=@xmath120 mev .",
    "the latter case corresponds to the previous calculation in @xcite .",
    "this was chosen because the @xmath121 excited state of @xmath0be is known to have the strong @xmath4 transition strength . the @xmath60 strength calculated with the @xmath22-independent potential",
    "is already presented in fig.2 .",
    "when the resonance exists , the sharp peak appears at the resonance energy . except for the energy region of the sharp peak ,",
    "the @xmath60 strength is rather similar between the two cases of the resonance and the bound excited state .",
    "the @xmath60 strength function with the @xmath22-independent potential has also similar shape , although its magnitude is larger by a constant factor .",
    "this difference is understood by noting that , for the case of the @xmath22-independent potential , there is no resonant nor bound excited state in the @xmath105-wave so that all the @xmath4 strength appears in the continuum .",
    "the similarity in the shape of the @xmath60 strength for three cases indicates that the energy dependence of the non - resonant part of the @xmath60 strength is mainly determined by the wave function of the ground state , and is rather insensitive to the level structure of the excited states .      in this section",
    "we analyze the coulomb breakup reaction of @xmath0be + @xmath1 pb at the incident energy of 72 mev / nucleon done at riken @xcite .",
    "to reproduce the known properties of the @xmath0be structure , we choose the potential between the neutron and the @xmath7be core nucleus in the following way : the depth @xmath93 is determined to reproduce the neutron separation energy of the @xmath0be ( 0.503 mev ) by assuming the @xmath85 orbit of the halo neutron . for @xmath122 channels",
    "the central and @xmath8 potentials are included .",
    "the strength of the @xmath8 potential is set the standard value for the @xmath105-shell nucleus , @xmath12332.8 mev@xmath124@xmath125 .",
    "the strength of the central potential is then determined to reproduce the observed @xmath121 excited state located at @xmath1110.183 mev from the neutron threshold .",
    "the state is assumed to be described simply with the @xmath126 orbit .",
    "no deformation or clustering effect of the @xmath7be core nucleus is taken into account .",
    "the time evolution of the wave function is calculated by using the same parameter sets as the previous section .",
    "the coulomb breakup cross section is obtained by the integration over the impact parameter larger than @xmath127 fm ( see eq .",
    "the reaction of the impact parameters smaller than @xmath128 proceeds by the nuclear force as well as the coulomb force , and is assumed to lead to more violent nuclear reaction processes .",
    "the coulomb breakup process is dominated by the dipole component of the target coulomb field , and proceeds through the excitation to two angular momentum channels , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . the @xmath60 transition strength to the bound level of @xmath121",
    "is calculated to be 0.251 @xmath129@xmath130 in the present model , which is considerably larger than the measured value , 0.115@xmath1310.011 @xmath129@xmath130 @xcite .",
    "the transitions to the other bound levels below the ground state , which should not occur in principle , are not excluded in the process of the time evolution of the wave function , but the mixing - in of those states is found to be negligible in the present calculation .",
    "we show in fig.5 the impact parameter dependence of the breakup cross section @xmath132 .",
    "the calculated distribution is compared with the data @xcite which are extracted from the measured breakup cross sections by using the classical argument for the trajectory .",
    "figure 6 compares the energy spectrum of the breakup cross section , @xmath133 , with the measurement @xcite .",
    "the calculation reasonably reproduces the measured distribution .",
    "dashed curves in figs .",
    "5 and 6 show the previous results of @xcite obtained without use of the @xmath8 potential , where the @xmath95 orbit was fitted to the energy of the bound excited @xmath121 level .",
    "since the @xmath4 transition to this excited state , though fairly strong , does not lead to the breakup reaction , the breakup probability was underestimated in the previous calculation . by the introduction of the @xmath8 potential the @xmath95 orbit",
    "now splits into two levels , @xmath126 and @xmath134 , in the present calculation .",
    "since the bound @xmath134 orbit is located below the ground state and the transition to this state is small , most of the @xmath4 strength in the @xmath135 channel is distributed in the continuum .",
    "this is the reason why the breakup cross section increased in the present model which includes the @xmath8 potential .",
    "the calculated @xmath60 strength function shown in fig .",
    "7 also confirms that the inclusion of the @xmath8 potential leads to the increase in the strength for the same reason mentioned above .",
    "the @xmath60 strength is compared to the experimental data which are extracted from the breakup cross sections by using the method of virtual photon spectra @xcite .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is rather good , which is expected because the energy spectrum of the breakup cross section has already shown reasonable agreement as shown in fig .",
    "we note , however , that the present model overestimates the @xmath60 strength to the @xmath136 excited state , and do not know what effects the overestimation causes on the breakup mechanism .",
    "we display in fig .",
    "8 the longitudinal and the transverse momentum distributions of the neutron - core relative motion .",
    "the impact parameter is set the smallest value , @xmath79 fm .",
    "the longitudinal momentum distribution is obtained by integrating the distribution of eq .",
    "( 9 ) with respect to @xmath137 and @xmath138 , while the transverse distribution is obtained by the integration over @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the longitudinal momentum distribution slightly shifts to the negative direction , whereas the transverse momentum distribution shifts to the positive direction .",
    "the average value of the momentum of the relative motion is @xmath140 fm@xmath82 , and @xmath141 fm@xmath82 , respectively .",
    "the measured difference of the longitudinal momentum is about 0.04 fm@xmath82 , which is close to the value of @xmath142 fm@xmath82 expected from the classical picture .",
    "though the calculation reproduces a right order of magnitude , it explains only a half of the measured value .",
    "finally we consider the breakup mechanism referring to the result of the previous section .",
    "the mechanism is different in two channels , @xmath143 and @xmath144 , because they have different level structure of the excited states . in the @xmath2 channel",
    "there is a bound excited state which is very close to the threshold .",
    "this situation is similar to the case of @xmath119 mev which we already investigated in fig .",
    "3 with the @xmath8 potential turned off .",
    "as expected , the momentum difference in this channel , especially in the longitudinal direction , is very small . on the other hand ,",
    "there is no bound excited state in the @xmath145 channel .",
    "the situation is thus similar to the case of @xmath146 mev in fig .",
    "3 . the average longitudinal momentum difference increases and turns out to be @xmath147 fm@xmath82 , about a half of the classical value of @xmath148 .",
    "the breakup reaction of @xmath0be is thus considered to occur in these two different mechanisms .",
    "our previous treatment @xcite which did not include the @xmath8 potential is equivalent physically to including only the former process .",
    "it is therefore understandable that we obtained the very small longitudinal momentum difference in that case .",
    "a realistic choice of the internal hamiltonian , particularly the inclusion of the spin - orbit interaction , is very important for a quantitative analysis of the breakup reaction of the @xmath0be nucleus .",
    "we investigated the coulomb breakup mechanism of the nuclei with single neutron - halo structure , focusing on the mechanism which causes the momentum difference of the neutron - core relative motion after the breakup .",
    "the breakup process was described in the framework of the time - dependent schrdinger equation by treating the target coulomb field as a time - dependent external potential .",
    "we first discussed the validity and the limitation of the classical arguments made for the post - acceleration effect from the quantum - mechanical viewpoint by investigating the dependence of the reaction mechanism on the neutron binding energy and the level structure of the halo nucleus .",
    "we found that the classical arguments do not have quantitative accuracy though it is useful to understand the qualitative aspects of the quantum calculation .",
    "a behaviour which can not be understood in the classical picture occurred particularly when the bound excited state locates close to the neutron threshold .",
    "small longitudinal and large transverse momentum differences were found in this case .",

    "a spin - orbit potential was included to describe the splitting of the structure of @xmath105 states .",
    "the reaction proceeds through two channels , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "since the @xmath121 channel has a bound excited state near the threshold but the @xmath3 channel does not have any bound excited states or low - lying resonances , the breakup mechanism is rather different in the two channels . by including the neutron-@xmath7be @xmath8 potential we took into account , in the present analysis , the difference in the breakup mechanism which is sensitive to the level structure of the nucleus . by this improvement",
    "the post - acceleration effect was enhanced compared to the previous case which neglected the @xmath8 potential and moreover the magnitude of the energy spectrum of the fragments was in reasonable agreement with the measured values .",
    "the momentum difference in the longitudinal direction was , however , still underestimated by a factor of two compared with experiment .",
