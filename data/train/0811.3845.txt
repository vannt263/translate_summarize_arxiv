    "in nature , there exist a large number of physical phenomena , and their scales range from the smallest scale ( the planck scale ) to the largest scale ( universe size ) .",
    "these phenomena are described in various ways depending on their scales .",
    "for example , small - scale phenomena are described by elementary particle physics , nuclear physics , and so on , while large - scale phenomena by cosmology , astrophysics , and so on .",
    "the scale characterizes each physical phenomenon and creates their hierarchy . in modern physics ,",
    "the scale is one of the most fundamental and important concepts .    in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and",
    "some other field theories , there exists a characteristic phenomenon that describes the nontrivial appearance of a scale . in classical qcd lagrangian ,",
    "only dimensional quantities are quark masses , and therefore qcd is scale invariant in the chiral limit at the classical level . however , after the quantization , scale invariance is violated and an energy scale appears in a nontrivial manner .",
    "this is called as dimensional transmutation , through which many dimensional quantities are created in real qcd , such as  mass gap \" , string tension , various condensates , and mass and size of hadrons .",
    "dimensional transmutation is an important phenomenon in modern field theory @xcite .",
    "one of the most well - known energy scales in qcd is the qcd scale parameter @xmath0 , which is defined through the running coupling constant @xmath1 in perturbative qcd .",
    "it is the energy scale where the naive perturbative calculation does not work at all .    the qcd running coupling constant depends on the energy scale as @xmath2 where @xmath3 , at one - loop level .",
    "therefore , the behavior of qcd phenomena at high energy is entirely different from that at low energy . at high energy or short distance ,",
    "perturbative qcd is valid due to the asymptotic freedom @xcite .",
    "in contrast , at low energy or long distance , the value of the qcd running coupling constant is large and nonperturbative effects are important .",
    "there exist many characteristic phenomena in nonperturbative region , such as quark confinement and chiral symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "it is found that the appearance of the energy scale enriches the qcd phenomena .",
    "one important question is _ what energy scale is relevant for each qcd phenomenon_. one may naively believe that the typical energy scale of nonperturbative qcd is @xmath0 .",
    "however , @xmath0 is just one scale that is defined through the running coupling constant .",
    "we do not know which energy components of gluons and quarks mainly contribute to a qcd phenomenon .",
    "also , it is not trivial whether such relevant energy components are the same or different between different nonperturbative phenomena , for example , quark confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .    in order to determine the relevant energy scale of qcd phenomena , we employ lattice qcd , which is the nonperturbative and first - principle calculation of qcd @xcite . in this paper",

    "the main concept of our framework is simple and general . it is to calculate a physical quantity , after artificially cutting a certain region of momentum space . from the relationship between the cut region and the resulting quantity",
    ", we can determine the relevant energy scale of the quantity .",
    "this concept would be applicable to many theories in physics @xcite . here",
    ", we introduce this concept to lattice qcd .",
    "the fundamental degree of freedom in lattice qcd is a link variable , which represents a gluon field on lattice .",
    "we consider a  cut \" on link variables in momentum space , and investigate its effect on the resulting quantity .",
    "the procedure for each gauge configuration is formulated as the following five steps .",
    "we generate a gauge configuration by monte carlo simulation of lattice qcd under space - time periodic boundary conditions , and obtain a finite number of coordinate - space link variables @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the coordinate - space lattice spacing .",
    "since the procedure is not gauge invariant , we fix the link variables with some gauge .",
    "it is desirable to choose a physically meaningful gauge on the lattice . in this paper",
    ", we mainly use the landau gauge .",
    "the landau gauge is well - known and frequently used also in continuum theory , and it gives a transparent connection between the link variable and the gauge field .",
    "step 2 . by carrying out discrete fourier transformation in the four - dimensional euclid space",
    ", we define the momentum - space link variable @xmath6 as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the total number of lattice sites .",
    "the momentum space represents a lattice with @xmath8 lattice sites , and boundary conditions are periodic .",
    "the first brillouin zone of the momentum space is a four - dimensional hypercube with each side of @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "the momentum - space lattice spacing is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of lattice sites in each direction .",
    "the momentum - space lattice spacing corresponds to the minimum unit of momentum , and it has mass dimension .     two - dimensional schematic figure of the uv cut @xmath12 and the ir cut @xmath13 on momentum - space lattice .",
    "the cut ( shaded ) region is described by eq .",

    "the momentum - space link variable @xmath6 is replaced with the free variable @xmath14 in the cut regions .",

    "we introduce a  cut \" on @xmath6 in a certain region of momentum space . outside the cut ,",
    "@xmath6 is replaced by the free - field link variable @xmath16 then , the momentum - space link variable with the cut is defined as @xmath17 the concrete form of the cut can be taken arbitrarily . the most natural choice to estimate",
    "the energy scale is the cut by a four - momentum length @xmath18 , which corresponds to a simple momentum cut in continuum theory .",
    "for example , an ultraviolet ( uv ) cut or an infrared ( ir ) cut by a four - momentum length is @xmath19 these cuts are schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in this study",
    ", we mainly use these uv and ir cuts for numerical calculations .",
    "another possible choice is , for example , @xmath20 instead of @xmath21 , which respects the lattice structure .",
    "of course , we can cut not only the uv or ir region , but also intermediate - momentum region , anisotropic region , and so on .",
    "step 4 . to return to coordinate space ,",
    "we carry out the inverse fourier transformation as @xmath22 since this @xmath23 is not an su(3 ) matrix , we project it onto an su(3 ) element @xmath24 by maximizing @xmath25.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such a projection is often used in lattice qcd algorithms . by this projection",
    ", we obtain the coordinate - space link variable @xmath24 with the cut , which is an su(3 ) matrix and has the maximal overlap to @xmath23 .",
    "step 5 . using these link variables",
    "@xmath24 , we compute the expectation value of physical quantities in the exact same way as original lattice qcd .    by repeating steps 3 - 5 with different values of the cut , we can quantitatively determine the relevant energy scale of a physical quantity .",
    "since we only have to replace @xmath24 instead of @xmath26 , this framework can be applied to all lattice calculations .",
    "in addition , since the fast fourier transformation is numerically easy task compared to gauge configuration generation or solver calculation , the computing time required for each cut is almost the same as that required for original lattice calculations .",
    "we expect that this framework can be broadly used to the analysis for the relevant energy scale of qcd phenomena .",
    "as for the gauge fixing , we mainly use the landau gauge . in lattice",
    "qcd with the euclidean metric , the landau gauge is defined by the condition that globally maximizes the quantity @xmath27",
    "\\equiv \\sum_{x}\\sum_{\\mu } { \\rm retr } u_\\mu ( x),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by the su(3 ) gauge transformation . in terms of the gauge field",
    "@xmath28 , this condition is equivalent to minimizing @xmath29 in euclidean qcd , and it is a sufficient condition for the local condition @xmath30 .",
    "then , the gauge fluctuation is maximally suppressed , so that the link variable can be expanded as @xmath31 in a well - defined manner , and there exists a transparent connection between the link variable and the gauge field . if one is interested in the direct information about the gauge field , it is possible to construct the similar framework with @xmath32 , which is renormalization - group invariant , instead of @xmath26 .",
    "for example , in the landau gauge , @xmath32 is approximately extracted as @xmath33 the trace part is subtracted for the traceless property of the gluon field .",
    "one may feel that our framework is similar to renormalization .",
    "this framework is _ not _ equivalent to renormalization transformation . in the case of renormalization transformation ,",
    "the gauge field outside cutoff is integrated out , however , in the case of our framework , the gauge field outside the cut is simply removed .",
    "such a simple removal of the gauge - field components breaks gauge invariance . since the gauge transformation property is nonlocal and nontrivial in momentum space , gauge invariance",
    "is lost when a certain momentum region is cut .",
    "if we do not fix the gauge , the resulting expectation value is zero , even in the case of a gauge - invariant operator .",
    "then , gauge fixing is needed in the framework .",
    "note , however , that the procedure itself is not restricted to a specific gauge , and we can use other gauges instead of the landau gauge . by comparing the results obtained in several different gauges , we can check the gauge dependence of the relevant energy scale .    in the case of a general gauge , since gauge fixing and momentum cut do not necessarily commute , it is nontrivial that these two conditions are satisfied simultaneously . in other words ,",
    "@xmath24 can deviate from the gauge - fixing condition which is originally imposed on @xmath26 .",
    "however , in the landau gauge , we have numerically checked that @xmath24 almost satisfies the landau gauge fixing condition , i.e. , @xmath34 $ ] is maximized , even after the back projection to su(3 ) .",
    "we apply our framework to the analysis of the interquark potential in terms of gluonic energy components .",
    "the interquark potential is one of the most fundamental quantities in qcd , and many types of interquark potentials have been studied by lattice qcd @xcite . among them , we here calculate the most basic potential , i.e. , the quark - antiquark ( @xmath35 ) potential . the @xmath35 potential is extracted from the expectation value of the wilson loop , which is a gauge - invariant path - ordered product of link variables along a loop .     the @xmath35 potential with the uv cut @xmath12 plotted against the interquark distance @xmath36 .",

    "the broken line is the original @xmath35 potential in lattice qcd . ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for a more quantitative argument , we need higher accuracy in momentum space .",
    "since the minimum momentum on lattice is the momentum - space lattice spacing @xmath15 , the four - momentum length @xmath21 is restricted to discrete values as @xmath41 then , we can only take discrete variation on the value of the cut .",
    "for example , the lattice calculations in the range @xmath42 yield the same result .",
    "this is a kind of discretization error in momentum space . in order to achieve a finer resolution in momentum , we must calculate with a smaller momentum - space lattice spacing , i.e. , a larger coordinate - space lattice volume .",
    "in addition , it is desirable to calculate with several different momentum - space lattice spacings .",

    "the value of the asymptotic string tension significantly decreases .",
    "we analyze the ir case in the same way and show the result in fig .",
    "all the results consistently suggest that the energy scale of the vanishing of the asymptotic string tension is around @xmath52 gev . above this energy scale , the asymptotic string tension is almost zero and the confinement potential asymptotically disappears .    from these quantitative analyses ,",
    "we conclude that the relevant energy scale of color confinement is below 1.5 gev , i.e. , color confinement originates from the low - energy gluon components below 1.5 gev .",

    "\\(ii ) our framework has an ambiguity of the cut form .",
    "for example , since the rotational invariance is broken on lattice , it is worth introducing a cut which respects the lattice structure of momentum space .",

    "<S> we propose a new lattice framework to extract the relevant gluonic energy scale of qcd phenomena which is based on a  cut \" on link variables in momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> this framework is expected to be broadly applicable to all lattice qcd calculations . using this framework </S>",
    "<S> , we quantitatively determine the relevant energy scale of color confinement , through the analyses of the quark - antiquark potential and meson masses . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant energy scale of color confinement is found to be below 1.5 gev in the landau gauge . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the string tension is almost unchanged even after cutting off the high - momentum gluon component above 1.5 gev . </S>",
    "<S> when the relevant low - energy region is cut , the quark - antiquark potential is approximately reduced to a coulomb - like potential , and each meson becomes a quasi - free quark pair . as an analytical model calculation , we also investigate the dependence of the richardson potential on the cut , and find the consistent behavior with the lattice result . </S>"
