    "suspensions of charged colloids are multi - component mixtures of mesoscopic ( colloidal ) particles and microscopic cations , anions , and solvent molecules . due to the large size- and charge asymmetry between the colloids on the one hand and the microscopic species on the other ,",
    "it is often difficult to treat all species on an equal footing in descriptions of e.g. the thermodynamic equilibrium properties of these systems . given the asymmetry it is natural , and often practical , to view colloidal suspensions as `` colloids - only '' systems described by effective colloidal interactions in which the presence of the microscopic particles appear only through medium properties such as the dielectric constant @xmath0 and the debye screening length @xmath1 .",
    "for bulk systems in equilibrium one can in fact prove ( by formally integrating out all the microscopic degrees of freedom in the partition function in a fixed colloid configuration ) that such a course - grained description yields the exact thermodynamics ; the problem is of course to actually perform the integration explicitly . within linear screening theory it is possible to integrate out the ionic degrees of freedom explicitly , and the resulting effective colloid pair interactions are of the screened - coulomb form @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the center - to - center distance between the colloidal pair @xcite .",
    "descriptions of suspensions of charged colloids on the basis of this effective pair potential have often been used over the years , see e.g. refs.@xcite for a few examples related to crystallisation of charged colloids , and ref.@xcite for a sedimentation study .",
    "however , in recent studies of sedimentation equilibrium of charged colloids at extremely low salinity this effective `` colloids - only '' view was _ not _ taken .",
    "instead the experiments @xcite , theory @xcite , and simulations @xcite of sedimentation equilibrium were essentially all analysed within the so - called primitive model , in which the colloids and ions are treated as charged massive hard spheres and charged massless point particles , respectively , while the solvent is treated as a continuum with dielectric constant @xmath0 .",
    "these studies have shown the existence of a spontaneously formed macroscopic electric field that lifts the colloids to much higher altitudes than to be expected on the basis of their mass .",
    "this electric field is the result of the competition between entropy ( favouring a homogeneous fluid ) , electrostatics ( favouring local neutrality ) , and gravitational energy ( favouring the colloids at the bottom , but not the cations or anions because they are essentially massless ) @xcite . at high salt concentrations local neutrality",
    "can easily be fulfilled at low entropic cost because of the large number of ions , and hence the competition is the usual one between colloid entropy and gravity , giving rise to a barometric distribution at low packing fractions . at low salinity the situation is more complicated , since fulfilling local neutrality would imply , when the colloids are all close to the bottom because of gravity , that a large fraction of the counterions must also be close to the bottom .",
    "such a state has a low ion entropy , because the ion distribution is far from homogeneous .",
    "it turns out , according to theories of e.g. refs.@xcite , that the state with the lowest grand potential spontaneously sacrifices local neutrality at the bottom and at the meniscus , such that an electric field is generated that lifts the colloids upward at the expense of gravitational energy , such that the colloids and the counterions can be rather homogeneously distributed over the available volume , thereby increasing their entropy . for colloids with buoyant mass @xmath4 and charge @xmath5",
    "the generated electric field strength was shown to be @xmath6 at low enough salt concentrations , such that the upward electric force @xmath7 and the downward gravitational force @xmath8 essentially cancel each other , leading to almost homogeneously distributed colloids .",
    "here @xmath9 is the gravitational acceleration , and @xmath10 the proton charge .",
    "this lift mechanism involving a macroscopic electric field was confirmed by primitive model simulations of colloids and explicit ions @xcite , and by a direct measurement of the potential difference between the bottom and the meniscus @xcite .",
    "moreover , quantitative agreement was found between the measured density profiles and the theoretically calculated ones in ref.@xcite , while the measured profiles of refs.@xcite agree with the theory of ref.@xcite which involves the electric field mechanism combined with charge regularisation .",
    "it is at first sight not at all obvious that these phenomena , which involve charge separation and macroscopic electric fields , can be described within the framework of the effective colloids - only picture .",
    "after all , in this picture the presence of anions and cations is only accounted for in the screening length @xmath1 that determines the range of the effective pairwise interactions .",
    "however , the theoretical study of ref.@xcite showed that hydrostatic equilibrium between the external gravity field and the internal ( osmotic ) pressure of the effective colloids - only system ( described by the simple and crude donnan equation of state in ref.@xcite ) , actually predicts the existence of the electric field and the lift effect at low salinity , despite the underlying local density ( and hence local neutrality ) approximation .",
    "the predicted density profile is linear with height @xcite , not unlike those predicted by a density functional treatment of an effective colloids - only system with screened - coulomb interactions @xcite .",
    "recently other accurate osmotic equations of state were employed and revealed the lift effect @xcite , and in fact ref.@xcite shows that the colloid density profile that was experimentally measured and quantitatively described in terms of the primitive model in ref.@xcite , can _ also _ be described quantitatively by a colloids - only theory with screened - coulomb interactions .",
    "the inconsistency of a theory based on local charge neutrality that predicts an electric field without explaining its sources does , apparently , not lead to erroneous predictions for the density profile , at least not for monodisperse suspensions at the parameters considered .",
    "the question we address in this paper is whether the `` colloids - only '' picture can also account for the very recently predicted layering and segregation phenomena in equilibrium sediments of _ binary _ mixtures of charged colloids at low salinity @xcite .",
    "these studies are actually direct extensions of the primitive model discussed before , but now with two ( or more ) colloidal components with different charges and masses . not only was the lifting effect recovered in refs.@xcite , but in addition segregation into layers was found , such that the two colloidal species order with height according to mass - per - charge : the colloids with the lowest mass - per - charge are found at higher altitudes .",
    "this implies the possibility of an inversion phenomenon , whereby sufficiently highly charged heavy colloids float on top of lighter colloids with a lower charge @xcite . in terms of the electric field",
    "this phenomenon can be understood , at least qualitatively , by first considering a pure system of colloidal species with mass @xmath11 and charge @xmath12 , such that the electric field strength is @xmath13 according to @xcite . adding a trace amount of colloids with mass @xmath14 and charge @xmath15 does not change the field strength @xmath16 , and hence the upward force @xmath17 on the colloids of species 2 exceeds the downward force @xmath18 provided @xmath19 . in other words , if the mass - per - charge of the tracer species 2 is smaller than that of species 1 , the former will float on top of the latter , even if @xmath20 . in the case",
    "that both colloidal species are present in substantial amounts , the segregation into layers was found with electric field strengths @xmath21 in the layer with species @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this implies a finite , nonzero charge density in the cross - over regime from one layer to another , as observed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the question we address in this paper is whether hydrostatic equilibrium ( based on a local density and neutrality assumption ) in a colloids - only system with screened - coulomb interactions can catch this layering phenomenon .",
    "there is , in addition , a second motivation for our present study .",
    "it stems from recent experimental progress in preparing binary mixtures with _",
    "oppositely _ charged colloids that do not aggregate but form equilibrium crystals @xcite .",
    "it is of fundamental interest to investigate the consequence of opposite charges in the equilibrium sediment , in particular when there is a substantial mass difference between the two colloidal species : to what extent does the lighter species then lift the heavier one , and to what extent does segregation into layers take place .",
    "we therefore present not only results for colloidal mixtures with the same charge sign ( @xmath23 ) , but also with a different sign ( @xmath24 . sedimentation in this latter parameter regime has , to the best of our knowledge , not been studied at all yet .",
    "we compare the results of computer simulations of the effective colloids - only system with theoretical calculations based on the poisson - boltzmann theory of ref.@xcite .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the model of the suspension , and discuss it viewed as either a mixture of colloids and ions as in ref.@xcite or as an effective colloids - only system that we simulate . in section",
    "iii we present the resulting equilibrium density profiles , and section iv is devoted to a discussion .",
    "in this section we introduce the details and the notation of our model of a binary mixture of charged colloids that we use in this paper , and discuss two alternative ways of describing the equilibrium density profiles in sedimentation equilibrium .",
    "we denote the ( fixed ) colloidal charges , radii , and buoyant masses by @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 for the two species @xmath28 , and assume that the charge is homogeneously distributed on the colloidal surface .",
    "the solvent is a continuum with dielectric constant @xmath0 at temperature @xmath29 , and the solvent volume is @xmath30 with @xmath31 the ( thermodynamically large ) area in the horizontal plane and @xmath32 the vertical height between the bottom of the sample ( at height @xmath33 ) and the meniscus ( at height @xmath34 ) .",
    "the gravitational force points in the negative vertical direction , such that the potential energy of a colloid of species @xmath22 at height @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 , with @xmath9 the gravitational acceleration .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the so - called gravitational length @xmath37 , which is the characteristic length scale of the barometric density distribution that holds in the dilute limit .",
    "the density profiles and the number of colloidal particles in the sample are denoted by @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , for species @xmath28 .",
    "we will also use the packing fraction profile @xmath40 , and we characterise the density of the suspension by the overall packing fractions @xmath41 .",
    "the average height of species @xmath22 , or its center - of - mass , is defined as @xmath42 which can be seen as a rough indication of the nature of the colloidal profile .",
    "the suspension is imagined to be in osmotic contact with a reservoir of massless , monovalent cations and anions of charge @xmath43 , with a total ion density @xmath44 , such that the debye screening length ( in the reservoir ) is @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the bjerrum length of the medium . here",
    "@xmath47 denotes the boltzmann constant .    in the present calculations we restrict attention to spheres of equal radius ,",
    "and we denote the ( common ) diameter of the spheres by @xmath48 .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that this system can be described by five coupled nonlinear equations for the following five unknown profiles : the colloid densities @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the two ion densities @xmath51 for the cations ( + ) and anions ( - ) , and the electrostatic potential @xmath52 or its dimensionless form @xmath53 .",
    "two relations are given by the boltzmann distributions @xmath54 $ ] for the ions , while the other three relations are a boltzmann distribution for the colloidal densities and the poisson equation for the potential , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath55 where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath35 , and where @xmath56 represent normalisation constants such that @xmath57 .",
    "we impose boundary conditions @xmath58 , which corresponds to a globally charge neutral system without any external electric field .",
    "this set of five equations follows directly from the minimum condition on a grand potential functional that only involves ideal - gas contributions for all four species , a potential energy of the colloids due to their mass , and a coulomb energy treated at a mean - field level @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to solve this set numerically on an @xmath35-grid , for details see ref.@xcite . from the solution for @xmath59 the magnitude of the electric field follows as @xmath60 .",
    "we note that these five equations are independent of the hard - core radii @xmath26 of the colloids , i.e. the short - range part of the ( direct ) correlations are not taken into account . as a consequence",
    "this level of approximation is not capable of describing packing effects properly .",
    "the radii @xmath26 are therefore only used to convert @xmath38 to @xmath61 . despite this",
    "shortcoming the present theory agrees quantitatively with the primitive model simulations of refs.@xcite .",
    "the poisson - boltzmann theory for the colloid - ion mixture differs , at least at first sight , substantially from a description of charged colloids based on the idea that colloids interact with each other through effective interactions that depend on the solvent properties such as the dielectric constant @xmath0 , the debye screening length @xmath1 , and the temperature @xmath29 .",
    "standard linear screening theory @xcite predicts that two colloids with charges @xmath25 and @xmath62 and radii @xmath26 and @xmath63 , separated by a distance @xmath3 , interact with the pair potential @xmath64 given by @xmath65 with the boltzmann constant @xmath47 and the bjerrum length @xmath46 as introduced above already . here",
    "we ignore the attractive dispersion forces . within this effective `` colloids - only '' description",
    "the presence of salt ions ( with a concentration @xmath44 in the reservoir ) is entirely included through the screening length @xmath1 .",
    "we assume throughout that the screening length in the colloidal interactions is independent of the colloid concentration .",
    "ignoring the counterion contribution to @xmath66 will turn out to be entirely justified for all cases we study in this paper : the ratio @xmath67 is always such that @xmath68 , i.e. the background electrolyte dominates the screening .",
    "typically we find @xmath69 , and since the effective screening parameter can be written as @xmath70 according to the donnan - like theory of e.g. ref.@xcite , provided the packing fraction is not too high , we find with @xmath71 that the effective screening length differs from the reservoir value @xmath1 by at most a percent .    the effective `` colloids - only '' description based on eq.([vij ] ) has proved to be very successful in describing many facets of colloid science , e.g. in the case of monodisperse suspensions it explains freezing into fcc and bcc crystals at sufficiently high densities @xcite , and it was recently used to describe crystal structures of oppositely charged colloids successfully @xcite .",
    "in this paper we use eq.([vij ] ) in monte carlo simulations in a box of dimensions @xmath72 , with @xmath73 the horizontal area . in all cases the vertical box height was taken to be @xmath74 , and the lateral width @xmath75 .",
    "we checked that @xmath76 was large enough to exclude finite size effects .",
    "we employed periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal directions ; in the vertical direction the system is bounded by hard walls that exclude the center of colloids at heights @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "we first consider binary mixtures of equal - sized colloids with a diameter @xmath79 nm , a bjerrum length @xmath80 nm , and screening constant such that @xmath81 .",
    "this corresponds to a salt concentration @xmath82 nm in the reservoir .",
    "in addition , we fix the colloidal charge of species 1 to @xmath83 , and the gravitational length of species 1 to @xmath84 .",
    "these numerical values , which correspond to the experimental system of ref.@xcite , give rise to an effective contact potential between the colloids of species 1 given by @xmath85 .",
    "the mass of species 2 is taken to be larger than that of species 1 , by a factor of 2 , such that @xmath86 .    in fig.[fig1 ]",
    "we plot the colloidal density profiles for three equimolar suspensions , with average packing fractions @xmath87 , for three values of the charge of species 2 given by ( a ) @xmath88 , ( b ) @xmath89 , and ( 3 ) @xmath90 .",
    "the box height is in all cases @xmath74 . case ( a ) , for which @xmath91 , shows a layer of the heavier species 2 floating on top of a layer of primarily species 1 , both from the theory based on eqs.([pb])@xcite , and from the colloids - only simulations using eq.([vij ] ) .",
    "the agreement between the theory and the simulations is quantitatively reasonable though not perfect .",
    "in particular the packing effects shown by the simulations at length scales of the order of a few @xmath92 close to the hard walls of the container are not reproduced by the theory , and the lifting effect for species 2 as predicted by the theory is quite a bit stronger than that found in the simulations .",
    "nevertheless it is a striking observation that the colloids - only picture is capable of describing the layering phenomenon without invoking explicitly to a selfconsistent electric field .",
    "case ( b ) , where @xmath89 such that it represents a mixture of charged and uncharged colloids , shows a clear lifting effect for species 1 , both from the theory and the simulations .",
    "the theoretical prediction for species 2 is a barometric distribution , which is bound to fail quantitatively in comparison with the simulations given the high packing fraction up to  0.5 at the bottom , which causes hard - sphere like density oscillations of species 1 close to the bottom in the simulations .",
    "case ( c ) is for oppositely charged colloids , and shows again a lifting and layering effect , whereby a layer of the heavier species 2 floats onto a rather dense layer at @xmath93 , both in the simulations and in the theory . ignoring the density oscillations on a length scale of a few @xmath92 in this bottom layer ,",
    "the densities take the almost constant values @xmath94 and @xmath95 , i.e. there is no large systematic decay and the ratio of the two densities does _ not _ correspond to @xmath96 .",
    "in fact , the agreement between theory and simulations in ( c ) is much less satisfactory than in the cases ( a ) and ( b ) : not only are the packing effects in the bottom layer not captured by the theory ( as before ) , but also the `` smoothed '' simulated profiles differ substantially from the theoretically predicted ones .",
    "we expect this to be caused by the strong correlations that build up between attracting pairs of oppositely charged colloids , with a contact potential of @xmath97 , and between the repelling pairs of species 2 with a contact potential @xmath98 .",
    "these correlations are not at all included in the theory .",
    "we checked explicitly that the bottom phase in the simulations is fluid and not crystalline .     and various charges @xmath99 given by ( a ) @xmath88 , ( b ) @xmath89 , and ( c ) @xmath90 , as a function of altitude @xmath35 in a sample of height @xmath74 .",

    "we can quantify this re - entrant layering effect by studying the average height @xmath105 as defined in eq.([hi ] ) as a function of @xmath99 , keeping @xmath106 and all the other parameter fixed .",
    "the result is shown in fig.[fig2 ] , and confirms the re - entrant phenomenon .",
    "it shows gross agreement between theory and simulation for all @xmath107 , although the agreement is substantially better for like - charged colloids ( @xmath108 ) than for opposite colloids ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "for @xmath110 the theory overestimates the lifting effect for the heavier particles and underestimates it for the lighter particles , in comparison with the simulations .",
    "for @xmath111 the theory predicts an essentially barometric distribution for the lighter species ( with a lower absolute charge ) , whereas the simulations still show a considerable lift effect for species 1 in this regime , probably because they are correlated due to the attractions of the highly charged heavier colloids that float on top of them ; this effect is poorly caught within the present theory .",
    "note that for the equimolar case considered here the theory predicts @xmath112 for @xmath113 ( i.e. for @xmath114 here ) and for @xmath115 ( since then @xmath116 ) .",
    "on the basis of the numerical results of fig.[fig2 ] these seem to be reasonable estimates for the crossover regimes .     of light ( open circles , species 1 ) and heavy ( solid squares , species 2 ) colloids as a function of the charge ratio @xmath107 for fixed @xmath83 .",

    "the theory still fails to describe the oscillating character of the profiles close to the bottom and the meniscus , but in all cases it can account for a `` smoothed '' version of the simulated profiles .",

    "this result is not obvious , since the theoretical ion - colloid description invokes the ion - entropy and a selfconsistent electric field that pushes the colloids upwards against gravity , while the ions only occur very indirectly in the screening constant of the effective system .",
    "nevertheless , these results suggest that both pictures are , at least qualitatively , different sides of the same coin . the inconsistency of the colloids - only system , where local electric neutrality is assumed whereas the ( donnan ) potential varies with height and thus requires a non - vanishing local charge density at least somewhere in the system , is apparently no serious problem for describing the phenomenology quantitatively .",
    "it is of interest to try to understand the layering mechanism within the colloids - only picture qualitatively . for",
    "like - charged colloids one may argue that the colloids with the highest charge repel each other most strongly , such that they expand to relatively high altitudes , leaving the lower charged ( and possibly lighter ) colloids behind at lower altitudes .",
    "for oppositely charged colloids the situation is more subtle : the attraction between the most expanded highest charged colloids and the less expanded lower charged colloids is such that the tendency to layering is reduced .",
    "this effect depends , probably , sensitively on composition and charge , and has not been investigated here in any detail .    at a quantitative level",
    "we can conclude that the theory does not catch the oscillatory character of the density profiles that were found close to the bottom and meniscus in the simulations .",
    "this effect requires a better account of the short - range correlations , and will be addressed in future work .",
    "the theory is , all in all , in better agreement with the simulations for repelling like - charged colloids than for attracting oppositely charged colloids .",
    "this can probably also be traced back to the poor level of our theoretical treatment of the short - ranged correlations , which are more pronounced in the presence of attractions .",
    "given the recent exciting new experimental developments in the study of oppositely charged colloids exhibiting equilibrium behaviour ( as opposed to irreversible aggregation phenomena ) @xcite , there is good reason to attempt to improve the theory .",
    "moreover , the theory is also shown to break down completely for @xmath127 ( for the present choice of parameters ) , where short - ranged correlations become more important once more . despite these shortcomings",
    ", our main conclusion should be that the layering phenomenon at low salt , say at @xmath128 , is a real effect that can be understood from a colloid - ion mixture perspective as well as from a colloids - only perspective .",
