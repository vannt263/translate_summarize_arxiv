    "there exist two different approaches to account for factorisable power corrections : they can either be calculated ( under certain modelling assumptions ) within a non - perturbative framework like light - cone sum - rules ( lcsr )  @xcite , or they can be estimated exclusively on the basis of dimensional arguments and fundamental model - independent relations  @xcite . while the first method with full correlations among the form factors is suitable in order to extract the maximal information from a particular non - perturbative calculation , the second option in which correlations are included via large - recoil symmetry relations reduces the dependence on non - perturbative input to a minimum .",
    "the two approaches are thus complementary and , because the large - recoil symmetries are expected to be the dominant source of correlations , they should give similar results .",

    "as the observables are effectively calculated at leading order ( @xmath48 effects are not calculated but only estimated ) , they exhibit a scheme dependence at @xmath48 implying a @xmath49 scheme dependence of power corrections . in order to ensure predictivity of the method",
    ", it is hence crucial to exploit the freedom of choosing a scheme to minimize the impact of the unknown power corrections on the relevant observables ( in the same way as in a fixed - order calculation in quantum field theory the renormalization scheme is chosen such that neglected higher orders do not spoil the perturbative expansion ) .",

    "the only existing calculation @xcite seems to be in contradiction with the low-@xmath11 scenarios of @xmath27 obtained with this ansatz in ref .  @xcite as it finds a much smaller size for the charm loop and , moreover , the opposite sign for its contribution in @xmath50 as compared to @xmath52 ( contrary to the assumption in ref .",

    "<S> after summarizing the current theoretical status of the four - body decay @xmath0 , we apply the formalism of spin - symmetries to the full angular distribution , including the s - wave part involving a broad scalar resonance @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> while we recover in the p - wave sector the known relation between the angular observables @xmath2 , we find in the s - wave sector two new relations connecting the coefficients of the s - wave angular distribution and reducing the number of independent s - wave observables from six to four . </S>",
    "<S> included in the experimental data analysis , these relations can help to reduce the background from s - wave pollution . </S>",
    "<S> we further point out the discriminative power of the maximum of the angular observable @xmath3 as a charm - loop insensitive probe of right - handed currents . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that in absence of right - handed currents the angular observables @xmath4 and @xmath5 fulfill the relation @xmath6 at the position where @xmath3 reaches its maximum . </S>"
