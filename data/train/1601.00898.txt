    "the figure shows the ratio of final avalanche growth rates @xmath149 , with @xmath150 the growth rate obtained in a code run using source @xmath151 ( here the subscript d denotes pure dreicer generation ) .",
    "each marker in the figure is thus computed from three separate code runs . as",
    "a proxy for @xmath152 , the average runaway momentum @xmath153 in the final time step @xmath154 of the simulation without a source was used , and for a given @xmath147 , different @xmath153 were obtained from simulations with varying values of @xmath155 ( and corresponding values of @xmath156 ) .",
    "the simulations were run for @xmath157 collision times , and @xmath154 was set to either @xmath158 , the first time step for which @xmath159 , or the first time step in which the growth rate started to become affected by the proximity of the runaway tail to the end of the simulation grid , whichever occurred first .",
    "the parameters of the scan were chosen to focus on the most interesting region of fig .",
    "[ fig : k_ratio]a  by performing longer simulations on larger momentum grids , the upper part of the figure could also be studied .",
    "exact agreement between figs .",
    "[ fig : k_ratio]a and b can not be expected , since the source , in addition to the cross section , depends on the details of the runaway distribution .",
    "figure [ fig : k_ratio]a should thus be viewed as a simplified analytical estimate for fig .  [",
    "fig : k_ratio]b .",
    "the different regions identified in fig .",
    "[ fig : k_ratio]a are still apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : k_ratio]b , however they are somewhat shifted in parameter space . in particular , the region where the rosenbluth - putvinski operator produces a higher growth rate is larger , whereas the opposite region  where the operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ch ] ) dominates  is smaller , or at least shifted to higher values of @xmath147 .",
    "figure [ fig : growth_vs_temp ] shows all the data points in fig .  [ fig : k_ratio]b , as a function of temperature .",
    "the figure confirms that the region where the more accurate operator produces a significantly higher growth rate is only accessible at temperatures @xmath160ev ( in the domain of validity of a linearized treatment ) . as is evident in the figure , however , regions where the rosenbluth - putvinski operator significantly overestimates the avalanche growth rate ( points below 1 on the vertical axis ) are present at all temperatures .",
    "the operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ch ] ) is thus of general interest .",
    "since the electric field spike responsible for the acceleration of runaways during a tokamak disruption is induced by the temperature drop , and therefore occurs slightly later than the drop itself , the temperature is low during the majority of the acceleration process . for significant runaway acceleration , @xmath161 is therefore required , and during the initial part of the acceleration process , parameters are likely those corresponding to the blue region of fig .

    "post - thermal - quench temperatures in iter are expected be as low as 10 ev and peak electric fields in disruptions can reach 80 v / m or more @xcite . towards the end of the thermal quench , the normalized electric field is then @xmath162 ( with @xmath163v / m , @xmath164ev and @xmath165m@xmath46 ) .",
    "a typical iter disruption would thus ( at least initially ) be firmly in the blue region of fig .",
    "[ fig : k_ratio]b , and the avalanche growth should be significantly higher than what the rosenbluth - putvinski source predicts .",
    "as the temperature is low , the runaways will also spend a comparatively long time at low momenta ( @xmath166 ) , where the disagreement between the operators is most pronounced .",
    "note that , according to the figure , an _",
    "average _ runaway energy of several mev ( @xmath167 ) is needed for the difference between the growth rates to become small for all @xmath147 , at which point the most energetic electrons will have reached energies of several tens of mev or more . however , since the electric field changes rapidly , the runaways may experience parameters corresponding to both the orange and blue regions in fig .  [",
    "fig : k_ratio]b before reaching such energies .",
    "further work is therefore needed to assess the overall impact on the avalanche growth of using the improved operator ( [ eq : ch ] ) , although it is clear that its use is essential for accurate analysis .",
    "runaway electrons are intimately linked to dynamic scenarios , as they predominantly occur during disruptions and sawtooth events in tokamaks .",
    "an accurate description of their dynamics in such scenarios requires kinetic modelling of rapidly changing plasma conditions , and mechanisms such as hot - tail runaway generation add to the already interesting set of phenomena of importance to the evolution of the runaway population .    in this paper",
    "we have described the modelling of several such processes , using the numerical tool code to calculate the momentum - space distribution of runaway electrons . in particular , we have investigated rapid - cooling scenarios where hot - tail runaway - electron generation is dominant .",
    "good agreement with previous theoretical work was observed , but code simulations also allow for flexible study of a variety of parameter regimes not readily accessible in analytical treatments , and involving other processes such as avalanche generation or synchrotron radiation .    furthermore , the full linearized non - relativistic fokker - planck - landau collision operator was discussed , and its implementation described .",
    "the operator was found to reproduce the expected spitzer conductivity in the relevant parameter regime and showed excellent conservation properties .",
    "the use of such an operator is essential for the correct current evolution in self - consistent modelling , and in particular when studying the interplay between current and electric - field evolution and runaway - electron generation during a disruption .",
    "the process of avalanche multiplication of the runaway population via close coulomb collisions was also considered , and an improved operator , relaxing some of the approximations of the commonly used rosenbluth - putvinski operator , was discussed .",
    "it was found that the avalanche growth rate can be significantly affected  increased for low temperatures and high @xmath147 and decreased for low @xmath147  by the use of the new operator .",
    "the change to the growth rate can be especially large during the early stages of the runaway acceleration process , thus potentially affecting the likelihood of a given runaway seed transforming into a serious runaway beam , and use of the improved operator is of particular relevance in disruption scenarios .",
    "the work presented in this paper paves the way for a better understanding of runaway - electron dynamics in rapidly changing scenarios , for instance during tokamak disruptions .",
    "it enables more accurate assessment of the risks posed by runaway electrons in situations of experimental interest , particularly in view of future tokamaks such as iter .",
