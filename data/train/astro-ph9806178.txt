    "the convolution of the theoretical profile obtained for the high resolution siii1808 line with the g160 m line spread function gives a blended feature centered at a velocity of 20.5  kms@xmath1 .",
    "this velocity is therefore adopted for the center of the interstellar siii  absorption lines in the four g160 m spectra , yielding a wavelength calibration of these spectra with the accuracy of the ech - b spectra .",

    "it shows that , as the ionization potential increases from di  to siiii , the central velocity of the absorption profile increases from a velocity intermediate to components c and d up to the velocity of component d , with a small departure for oi  and cii  which are saturated .",

    "there appears to be two distinct components ( named c and d ) with ionization fractions greater than 40% and 90% respectively .",
    "constraints have been derived for the depletion which are similar to those for the warm diffuse gas in both the disk and halo for component c , and to those for the high velocity halo clouds for component d. silicon seems to be undepleted in cloud d and only slightly depleted in cloud c , which is also the case for the other elements studied .",
    "the ionization ratios observed are roughly compatible with those given by theoretical calculations of collisional ionization equilibrium at temperatures close to 20000  k. as the kinetic temperatures of the clouds are actually a factor of two lower , we conclude that if the clouds are collisionally ionized , they are out of equilibrium",
    ". nevertheless photoionization by @xmath0  cma  and @xmath4  cma  has not been ruled out and the data we present should be analysed with more complete photoionization models taking into account the strong euv excess of these stars",
    ".    the processes which have led to this physical state could be the same as those which have given rise to the high velocity clouds detected in the halo .",
    "new obervations of the interstellar medium in the sight - line to @xmath4  cma  lead to similar conclusions for the lic and another component detected toward this star . a shock which travelled in the past through these clouds",
    "could have ionized them and disrupted the dust grains giving rise to the ionization and low depletion values found ; the clouds would now be recombining after cooling .",
    "thus , the main components detected towards @xmath0  cma  could result from the blast - wave that created the so - called local bubble .",
    "we thank alfred vidal - madjar for making the data available to us and dan welty for providing his profile fitting software .",
    "we are grateful to alan harris and to our referee k. de boer for suggestions which led to substantial improvements on the manuscript .",

    "<S> + special models of photoionization by the two euv - excess stars @xmath0 cma and @xmath4 cma would be needed for a detailed discussion of the ionizing mechanisms of the clouds ; their ionization ratios are nevertheless roughly compatible with collisional ionization at temperatures around 20000  k , substantially higher than the kinetic temperatures derived from the line widths . </S>",
    "<S> their characteristics suggest that the clouds may be in the process of cooling down and recombining after having been shocked and ionized by some violent events , possibly related to the local bubble formation . </S>"
