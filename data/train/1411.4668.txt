    "operads are combinatorial devices that encode families of algebras defined by multilinear operations and relations .",
    "common examples are the operads @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 whose algebras are associative , associative and commutative , and lie algebras , respectively .",
    "colored operads are a bit more exotic , with what is likely the most famous example being voronov s `` swiss - cheese operad , '' which models the genus - zero moduli spaces that appear in open - closed string theory .",
    "other examples of colored operads encode complicated algebraic structures such as operadic modules , enriched categories , and even categories of operads themselves .",
    "the study of model category structures on categories of colored operads has found many recent applications including the rectification of diagrams of operads  @xcite and the construction of simplicial models for @xmath6-operads  @xcite .",
    "our goal in this paper is to further the study of the quillen model category structure of colored operads initiated in  @xcite .",
    "specifically we are interested in understanding if the category of colored , symmetric operads is * left proper * ; ie we wish to know if weak equivalences between _ all _ colored , symmetric operads are closed under cobase change along cofibrations .",
    "the main result of this paper is to say that this is not the case , but we give sufficient conditions on a monoidal model category @xmath7 in order for the model category structure of @xmath7-enriched , colored , symmetric operads to be * relatively * left proper , ie for the class of weak equivalences between @xmath1-cofibrant operads to be closed under cobase change along cofibrations ( theorem [ oalg - model - left - proper ] ) .",
    "recall that in any model category , the class of weak equivalences between cofibrant objects is closed under cobase change along cofibrations .",
    "the class of @xmath1-cofibrant operads is much larger than the class of cofibrant operads ; in particular , this class includes small examples such as the associative operad @xmath3 .",
    "if one is instead willing to consider the category of _ reduced _ ( or _ constant - free _ ) operads ( those satisfying @xmath8 ) , then batanin and berger @xcite prove a strict left properness result .",
    "the question of ( relative ) left properness for categories of symmetric operads has many immediate applications .",
    "as an example , left properness makes it easier to identify homotopy pushouts since , in a left proper model category , any pushout along a cofibration is a homotopy pushout .",
    "relative left properness allows us to make similar statements .",
    "furthermore , understanding when left properness holds allows us to describe the rectification of homotopy coherent diagrams and weak maps between homotopy @xmath9-algebras , as first proposed by berger and moerdijk in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6 ) .",
    "more explicitly , it is well known that the structure of a model category on the category of @xmath7-enriched operads is important for the study of up to homotopy algebras over an operad such as @xmath10-algebras and @xmath11-algebras which are respectively associative and commutative `` up to homotopy . ''",
    "the deformations of algebraic structures and morphisms between algebraic structures are controlled by up - to - homotopy resolutions of ( colored ) operads .",
    "these resolutions include the w - construction of boardman and vogt @xcite , the cobar - bar resolutions of ginzburg and kapranov @xcite and kontsevich and soibelman @xcite , and the koszul resolutions of fresse @xcite . in their paper @xcite ,",
    "berger and moerdijk show that a coherent theory of up - to - homotopy resolutions of operadic algebras is provided by a quillen model category structure on @xmath0-colored operads in a general monoidal model category @xmath7 .",
    "( relative ) left properness is one way to establish when these resolutions can be rectified , in the sense of being weakly homotopy equivalent to strict @xmath9-algebras .    * related work * to the knowledge of the authors , the idea of relative left properness , and much of the inspiration for this paper , was first established in the thesis of spitzweck  @xcite where he considers semimodel structures of categories of operads in general monoidal model categories .",
    "similarly , dwyer and hess @xcite and muro @xcite established a left properness result which is identical to that of theorem  [ oalg - model - left - proper ] for nonsymmetric , monochromatic operads enriched in simplicial sets , respectively , monoidal model categories .",
    "of particular note , muro s proof requires that his monoidal model categories satisfy weaker conditions than those imposed on the monoidal model categories in this work .",
    "the stronger conditions in theorem  [ oalg - model - left - proper ] are due to both the extra complexity introduced by the addition of the symmetric group actions and the authors desire to exhibit the most direct proof of this result which still applies in many situations .",
    "it must also be noted that one could obtain similar results using the techniques of the recent paper of batanin - berger  @xcite ; see remark [ remark_on_bb ] .",
    "the actual definition of relative left properness in @xcite is slightly different , though morally the same , as that used in sptizweck  @xcite , muro  @xcite , and this paper and we have made note of similarities in their results and our own throughout this paper .",
    "again , the authors of this work have made stronger assumptions on our enriching monoidal model category , as it is our belief that these assumptions allowed for greater clarity in the arguments while still being applicable in most cases of interest .",
    "these assumptions also allow for generalizations to more complicated cases such as relative left properness of dioperads and wheeled properads @xcite ( the latter of which is inaccessible to the batanin - berger machinery ; see @xcite ) , which will serve as key components of the authors larger body of work constructing models for @xmath6-wheeled properads .    *",
    "acknowledgments * the authors would like to thank giovanni caviglia and kathryn hess for enlightening discussions and for pointing out errors in earlier drafts of this paper .",
    "we would also like to thank bill dwyer for allowing us to use his counter - example to left properness of colored operads in section  [ counter - example ] .",
    "this counter - example was also independently obtained by caviglia as part of his thesis work .",
