    "proton decay is one of the most important predictions of grand unified theories ( guts ) and a lot of experimental effort has been devoted to detect it . up to now , however , no such decay process have been observed , and the lower bound of the proton lifetime has been pushed up to @xmath6 years by the super - kamiokande experiment .    to constrain the parameter space of guts by the proton lifetime ,",
    "we need a reliable estimation of the hadronic matrix elements @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 represents pseudoscaler meson and nucleon respectively and @xmath10 is a three - quark operator . in principle",
    ", lattice qcd allows a precise determination of the matrix elements from the first principles . in previous work",
    ", we made a gut - model - independent calculation of the matrix elements for all dimension - six three - quark operators using the wilson quark action and the plaquette gauge action in the quenched approximation@xcite .",
    "there remain two major systematic errors in the previous calculation : scaling violation and quenching effects . as a first step to reduce the systematic errors , this work is devoted to study the scaling violation effects .",
    "we leave incorporation of the dynamical quark effects to future work .",
    "with the aid of chiral perturbation theory@xcite , the proton decay matrix elements @xmath7 are related to the so - called @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters , which are defined by @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the proton spinor .",
    "calculation of these parameters is much simpler than the direct calculation of the matrix elements @xmath7 : the former is obtained from two - point functions with zero spatial momentum projection , while the latter requires three - point functions with finite spatial momenta .",
    "it should be noted that our previous study showed that the matrix elements obtained from the three - point functions are roughly comparable with the tree - level predictions of the chiral lagrangian with the @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters determined on the lattice .    .",
    "simulation parameters .",
    "the lattice spacing @xmath13 is determined from @xmath14 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the lattice operators relevant for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters are renormalized as @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 and the additional mixing operator is @xmath18 the renormalization constants @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are calculated perturbatively at one - loop level@xcite .",
    "the continuum operators are defined in ndr ( naive dimensional regularization ) with the @xmath22 subtraction scheme .    to obtain the matrix elements ,",
    "we compose a ratio @xmath23 where @xmath24 is defined by @xmath25 this factor is estimated from the proton correlator with local source and local sink .",
    "it is well known that a precise determination of @xmath24 is rather hard because of large statistical fluctuations of the local - local correlator . on the other hand",
    ", the ratio of two - point functions can be calculated using the smear - local proton correlator whose statistical fluctuation is fairly small compared to the local - local correlator .",
    "this situation leads us to the following strategy : ( i ) for @xmath24 we resort to the result obtained from high statistical calculation of the quenched light hadron spectrum performed by the cp - pacs collaboration@xcite .",
    "( ii ) employing the same parameters as the cp - pacs calculation , we make a new simulation to estimate the ratio of two - point functions including the mixing operators , which were not incorporated in the previous cp - pacs simulation . after combining the results of @xmath24 and the ratio of two - point functions",

    "our calculation is carried out in quenched qcd with the wilson quark and the plaquette gauge actions .",

    "we adopt three values of lattice spacings in the range @xmath26 0.1@xmath270.064 fm .",
    "the spatial lattice size is about 3 fm to avoid finite size effects .",
    "we employ four quark masses corresponding to @xmath28 0.75@xmath270.5 for each @xmath1 .    for smearing the source ,",
    "the quark wave function in the pion is measured for each hopping parameter on gauge configurations fixed to the coulomb gauge except for @xmath29=0 time slice where the wall source is placed@xcite .",
    "to estimate @xmath24 we first fit the smeared - local proton correlator to a single exponential form @xmath30 , and then the local - local proton correlator is fitted to @xmath31 with @xmath32 fixed to the value determined by the smeared - local correlator .",
    "the matrix elements defined on the lattice are converted to those in the continuum at @xmath33 and the scale is evolved up to @xmath34=2gev using the two - loop renormalization factor in the continuum@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : lqdep ] shows the light quark mass dependence of the @xmath0 parameter at @xmath35 , which is well described by a linear function .",
    "similar quark mass dependence is found for the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "we check that linear and quadratic extrapolations yield consistent results within error bars in the chiral limit at all the lattice spacings .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : adep ] , we plot the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 in physical unit as a function of lattice spacing @xmath13 , where we experiment with three choices @xmath36 , @xmath14 and @xmath37 as physical input to determine the lattice spacing . in case of the nucleon mass @xmath36 as physical input",
    "we find little scaling violation , which allows us to take the continuum limit of the parameters by linear extrapolation .",
    "we take the extrapolated value as the central one of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters in the continuum limit . on the other hand ,",
    "the parameters show rather large scaling violation if we set the lattice spacing by the rho meson mass @xmath14 or the pion decay constant @xmath37 .",
    "although in these cases the values at the continuum limit possibly deviate from the result obtained with @xmath36 as physical input , simple linear extrapolation is not reliable to estimate the deviation .",
    "instead , we estimate this ambiguity from the result of quenched light hadron mass spectrum obtained by the cp - pacs collaboration@xcite , which shows that the values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 in quenched qcd deviate from the experiment by about 7% and 10% respectively in the continuum limit , once we set the lattice spacing by @xmath14 .    taking account of this ambiguity , we obtain @xmath38 with @xmath39 in the continuum limit , where the first error is statistical and the second one is due to scale setting .",
    "we note that the relative sign of @xmath0 and @xmath1 could be important , whereas the overall one is irrelevant .        this work is supported by large scale simulation program no .",
