    "orbital models have become a very active field of research in the quest for exotic states of matter and novel properties in systems with coupled charge , spin , and orbital degrees of freedom . in real materials ,",
    "each class of active orbital , lattice structure , and extent of electron filling leads to a different set of problems .",
    "an overview of this fabulous wealth of possibilities , focusing on undoped systems and including a complete review of relevant materials , may be found in ref .",
    "[ ] .    among these many models , one of the most exotic and mysterious is the triangular  lattice @xmath0 spin  orbital model considered in ref .",
    "[ ] . by this",
    "is meant the insulating system with a single , fully localized electron on each lattice site , and occupying one of the threefold ",
    "degenerate @xmath0 orbitals , a situation which would be realized , for example , in undistorted natio@xmath1 or , with holes , in coo@xmath1 . depending on",
    "which orbitals they occupy , the particles have both superexchange and direct  exchange interactions whose ratio is _ a priori _ unknown , but it was shown@xcite that different types of bond dimer state of the spin and orbital degrees of freedom are favored very strongly for all values of this ratio .",
    "the resulting , very rich , phase diagram of possible states includes candidate resonating valence  bond ( rvb ) states in the limit of pure superexchange interactions and , in the direct  exchange limit , candidate systems for extremely subtle order  by  disorder selection of special valence  bond crystal ( vbc ) states from very highly degenerate manifolds of dimer coverings .",
    "the question left unanswered despite the extensive energetic studies and plausibility arguments in ref .",
    "[ ] was whether one could gain more explicit indications for the suggested unconventional nature of the true ground state in either of these cases .",
    "the exotic phenomena which are known from simplified models of highly frustrated and degenerate systems include true liquid phases with no unbroken symmetry in the ground state , topological sectors and excitations , and fractionalization and deconfinement of elementary spinon  type quasiparticles . given the exhaustive search for both experimental and theoretical realizations of such phenomena in real , electronic systems , the triangular ",
    "lattice @xmath0 spin ",
    "orbital model is clearly a prime candidate for further investigation . here",
    "it can be noted that the preponderance of evidence in favor of rvb states suggests further that the candidate ( spin  orbital ) liquid phase is gapped , and hence would have only short  ranged correlation functions and massive , fractional spinon ",
    "orbiton excitations .",
    "the aim of this study is to approach the unanswered questions through effective quantum dimer models ( qdms ) .",
    "a review of qdms , including their origin , properties , and rich associated physics , can be found in ref .",
    "[ ] . for the present purposes , specifically pursuing the tantalizing prospect of an rvb state in a real electronic system ,",
    "the agenda is that laid out as a practical prescription in ref .",
    "[ ] , namely to map the starting hamiltonian to the triangular  lattice qdm . in the original qdm exposition of rokhsar and",
    "kivelson,@xcite it was shown for the square lattice that an exact rvb state exists at one point in the phase diagram ( henceforth an `` rk point '' ) , and it was later found@xcite that the same model on the triangular lattice allows a rigorous proof for the existence of a true rvb phase with gapped spinon excitations over a finite regime of parameter space .",
    "this therefore offers not only a finite chance of any given model having the appropriate energetics , but also an approach which captures automatically the topological criteria associated with rvb physics .",
    "the generic qdm phase diagram@xcite nevertheless contains rvb states over at best a rather narrow range of parameters .",
    "its bulk is occupied by static `` columnar '' and `` staggered '' dimer regimes , which respectively maximize or minimize the number of active four  site units , or by other possibilities with a more complex breaking of translational symmetry on generalized plaquettes .",
    "thus the same approach can also be adopted for the direct  exchange limit of the starting model,@xcite not in this case with intent to find an rvb phase , but with a view to isolating the leading fluctuation term which might be responsible for selecting one , or a set of , dimer coverings which are more energetically favorable , through the quantum fluctuations they allow , than all others .    because qdms are in general highly simplified , any mapping from a realistic hamiltonian discards of necessity many degrees of freedom , and thus there is no systematic procedure for their derivation .",
    "when proceeding from real , @xmath2 , spin  singlet dimers , an immediate dichotomy arises between the definition of qdm states as mutually orthogonal and the fact that no conventional spin ",
    "dimer states are orthogonal ( the overlap factor being trivially @xmath3 per site ) .",
    "this non  orthogonality problem is strongly reduced in the triangular  lattice @xmath0 spin  orbital model , and entirely absent in its direct  exchange limit , for reasons which will become apparent in sec .",
    "however , this fact also forbids the type of dimer overlap expansion exploited in ref .  [ ] , and mandates instead a process which proceeds directly from the electronic hamiltonian .",
    "the process of deriving an effective qdm from an orbitally degenerate electronic hamiltonian was followed in ref .",
    "[ ] , in the course of an analysis of linio@xmath1 ( a system of @xmath4 electrons on a triangular lattice ) , and while the rationale is similar here , the orthogonality of dimer coverings requires an approach somewhat different in detail .    as a foretaste of the results to follow , in the superexchange limit",
    "one finds two different types of `` three  color '' qdm . the individual dimers are either spin singlets with three different flavors corresponding to the triplet states of the orbitals ( ss / ot ) , or orbital singlets with a conventional spin  triplet flavor",
    "( os / st )",
    ". in both cases , the 9@xmath59 @xmath6 and @xmath7 matrices of the qdm reflect the strong breaking of translational and rotational symmetry associated with the consideration of four  site plaquette units in the definition of the qdm . in the former case",
    "this drives a lifting of degeneracy in favor of the @xmath8 components of the orbital triplet , while in the latter the spin  triplet dimers may continue to interchange their flavors .    in the direct  exchange limit",
    ", there is no mixing between two pairs of dimers on a plaquette , and both the @xmath6 and @xmath7 terms of the conventional qdm are identically zero ; this rigid locking of dimer color to lattice direction means that the effective model reduces to the one  color variant .",
    "the relevant qdm capturing the lowest  order dimer resonance processes is in fact one defined on six  bond triangular loops .",
    "while this model dictates a specific ground state , selected from the extensively degenerate manifold of dimer coverings , it does not exclude the possibility of a type of one  dimensional physics@xcite where the character of short , fluctuating segments of frustration ",
    "decoupled spin chains persists despite the high site coordination of the triangular lattice .",
    "finally , it should be stressed that none of the physics discussed here is to be confused with that of the `` spin  orbital liquid '' and `` spin ",
    "orbital singlet '' states introduced recently in ref .  [ ] .",
    "the work of these authors depends intrinsically on a strong spin ",
    "orbit coupling interaction @xmath9 , and should perhaps therefore be referred to more strictly as `` ( spin - orbit)al '' physics . in the present study , which follows a line dating back to the seminal work of kugel and khomskii,@xcite the terminology `` spin  orbital '' refers only to the connection , dictated precisely by the electronic hamiltonian , between the magnetic exchange interactions and the orbital state of each ion , with @xmath10 assumed to be negligible .",
    "while this approximation is usually taken to be reasonable for @xmath11 ions , @xmath10 may indeed become important when the physics of the system depends sensitively on the lifting of high degeneracies .",

    "[ ] , but , as explained there , the very different nature of the two types of singlet state mean that @xmath46 has a qualitative effect on the physics of the system only in rare situations",
    ".    before analyzing the model in more detail , it is necessary to delimit the parameter space of interest to this study , and also to make one essential and completely general comment concerning dimer states of colored electrons .",
    "first , the focus of this manuscript is only the two limits of pure superexchange and purely direct exchange . in the superexchange limit , only the regimes with hund coupling ratio @xmath43 and with physical values @xmath47 ( which is `` large '' in a sense to be made explicit below ) , will be considered . in the direct  exchange limit ,",
    "only @xmath43 is of interest in the context of qdms : the physics of dimer  based models is determined by purely static contributions at any finite @xmath34,@xcite and changes away from dimer  based states only at the unrealistically large value @xmath48 .",
    "thus there are three situations to elucidate , all of which have already been shown to be dominated by dimer formation .",
    "this restriction is made partly for reasons of practicality , partly to concentrate on the essentially different physics of the differing limits , and partly as a consequence of the above observation concerning the irrelevance of @xmath46 and absence of meaningful mixed processes .      as noted above ,",
    "a serious problem in mapping real spin models to qdms is the `` non - orthogonality catastrophe , '' the fact that all dimer coverings @xmath49 have finite overlap with all others .",
    "this is a significant impediment to many forms of both analytical and numerical progress . for @xmath2 entities forming bond spin ",
    "singlet states , the generic overlap of two singlets at the same site is simply the prefactor of the singlet wave function , @xmath50 . in the present context ,",
    "the most meaningful calculation involving @xmath51 is to consider the overlap of the wave functions of two `` horizontal '' and two `` vertical '' su(2 ) spin singlets on a four  site plaquette , where it is easy to show from the common elements of @xmath52 and @xmath53 that @xmath54 = 1/2 .",
    "the single most important generic feature of raising the number of dimer colors , noted already in the context of @xmath55 expansions,@xcite is expected to be that @xmath51 is reduced , perhaps by a power .",
    "however , this hypothesis is dependent on the model , and for a model such as the current one , where electron orbital color sectors change with bond direction , the overlap matrix is not uniform , and in some cases is identically zero . for the three cases of interest here ,",
    "this can be shown very simply by repeating the exercise above for ( os / st ) , ( ss / ot ) , and ( ss/@xmath56 ) units , where @xmath57 indicates the bond color .",
    "for each of the two spin ",
    "orbital triplet cases there are nine possible overlap matrix elements to consider , not all of which will be illustrated explicitly .",
    "taking a plaquette of parallel @xmath15 and @xmath12 sides , one has @xmath58 and similarly , whence @xmath59 for ( os / st ) dimers there are finite overlap matrix elements within each @xmath60 sector , all ( but one ) of considerably higher order than the conventional spin  singlet problem .",
    "however , the 9@xmath59 overlap matrix is rather sparse . for ( ss / ot ) dimers ,",
    "the orbital color combinations forbid any overlap matrix elements other than for pairs of @xmath61 dimers . for bond  colored , spin  singlet dimers there are no overlap matrix elements at all .",
    "thus the highly non  uniform nature of the matrix elements in the superexchange model and the fact that they vanish in the direct  exchange model preclude any sort of meaningful expansion in the inverse of the overlap matrix.@xcite as noted in sec .",

    "dimer bonds at @xmath43,@xcite leaving a threefold degeneracy corresponding to the orbital triplet states of the two electrons , @xmath63 , 0 , and @xmath64 .",
    "thus one expects a qdm with three different flavors of dimer , a situation depicted in fig .",
    "note that these `` colors '' are not the same as the spectral colors in fig .  1 , which are associated directly with the symmetry of the @xmath0 levels , but correspond to three possible orbital states on each bond of a given direction [ eqs .",
    "( [ eotp])([eotm ] ) ] .",
    "the three analogous states for a different lattice direction are composed of a different @xmath0color pair .",
    "however , for physical values of @xmath34 around 0.1 , the ( os / st ) dimers are preferred as the direct lifting of degeneracy in the one  bond hamiltonian outweighs the kinetic effects .",
    "this regime is delimited by a lower bound , which for the four  site cluster is @xmath65 , and an upper bound of @xmath66 where the ground state becomes ferromagnetic by a lifting of the spin ",
    "triplet degeneracy.@xcite within this range , one has a three  color qdm similar to the ( ss / ot ) case [ fig .",
    "2(a ) ] , but one in which the colors correspond to the spin triplet states of the two electrons , @xmath67 , 0 , and @xmath64 .",
    "the triplet states in the spin sector are the same for every bond direction , and this fact is responsible for the differences from the ( ss / ot ) situation observed already in the overlap matrix elements .",
    "the qdm matrix elements can also be expected to differ in several respects .",
    "summarizing the situation to this point , in the superexchange limit of the model one has a number of energetic criteria which can be compared to the rvb criteria of ref .",
    "the former are@xcite ( _ i _ ) a very strong tendency to dimer formation , ( _ ii _ ) a large semi  classical degeneracy of basis states , namely the set of coverings formed from these dimers , and ( _ iii _ ) that resonance processes on four  site plaquette units provide a significant energetic contribution . from ( _ iii",
    "_ ) , a minimal triangular  lattice qdm should in principle contain , within the dimer  flipping term @xmath6 and the static pair term @xmath7 , the leading corrections to the static vb energy ( determined by @xmath68 ) .",
    "the question is then reduced to whether the regime @xmath69 of rvb physics@xcite can be attained .      here only the @xmath43 limit of the model , @xmath70 will be considered . as noted above , the spin ",
    "singlet state optimizing the bond energy can be formed only from two electrons of the bond color .",
    "thus the three apparent @xmath0 colors of the dimers are locked rigidly to the bond direction , with no finite matrix elements for directional fluctuations , a situation depicted in fig .",
    "the effective qdm will then be equivalent to a one  color model .",
    "in addition to the studies of ref .",
    "[ ] , this model has also been considered in some detail by jackeli and ivanov.@xcite these authors demonstrated that the extensively degenerate manifold of ( bond  colored ) dimer coverings forms a set of exact eigenstates of the second  order hamiltonian . in deducing the leading perturbations which would select a type of order",
    ", they allowed finite values of @xmath71 , which lead at order @xmath72 to a ferromagnetic interaction on interdimer bonds with one ( but not two ) dimers of the bond color . as a result ,",
    "particular static dimer configurations are selected ( the type of state is unique , albeit with a translational and rotational degeneracy of 60 ) , but there remains no contribution from the positional resonance of dimers .",
    "the aim here is to investigate the consequences of the lowest  order dimer resonance processes of a type which would give valid contributions to a qdm .        in this limit of the model , electrons in dimer singlets",
    "may hop only in the direction corresponding to their bond color .",
    "thus virtual processes are highly restricted and the true dimensionality of the system is far lower than the connectivity of the triangular lattice would suggest.@xcite because a four  site plaquette contains no two bonds of the same direction , not only is the overlap matrix element zero ( above ) but the @xmath6 and @xmath7 terms of the conventional , triangular  lattice qdm are also identically zero . a qdm based on higher",
    " order terms will therefore be required .",
    "the only kinetic contributions on the triangular lattice are given by paths of even side  lengths , and which enclose even numbers of sites .",
    "some valid loops are shown in fig .",
    "the contributions @xmath73 and @xmath74 from fluctuation processes on six  bond triangles will be computed , while the leading perturbations from higher allowed loops ( the 10bond trapezium and 14bond irregular pentagon ) can be argued to be small .",
    "the ground state of the resulting @xmath73@xmath74 qdm should contain the leading effects of dimer resonance processes on the highly degenerate manifold of static vb coverings.@xcite one may then also consider whether the energy of this state is more favorable than the spontaneous one  dimensionalization of the system into effectively decoupled heisenberg chains of a single orbital color .",
    "this outcome , the lowest  energy possibility found in ref .",
    "[ ] , is generally held to be rather unlikely , although from the 1d nature of the electronic processes in this limit of the model it is not entirely implausible .",
    "commenting briefly on further models which may arise within the @xmath0 system on the triangular lattice , clearly there are many of these even at unit filling per site .",
    "the entire range @xmath75 is of obvious physical importance , and in principle presents a model with four types of dimer .",
    "however , the lack of symmetry between the two limits implies automatic selection effects which will favor a smaller number of these dimers ( those maximizing virtual kinetic proceses ) .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "[ ] suggest a first ",
    "order transition from the superexchange regime ( qdms with up to three colors ) to the direct  exchange regime ( a one  color qdm ) at an intermediate value of @xmath76 but with no intermediate phase .",

    "specific colored qdms can be obtained for the three cases of interest and , within the approximations inherent in the derivation process ( by which is meant the breaking of translational symmetry and the discarding of very many degrees of freedom ) , all are expected to yield additional information concerning the physics of the ground state of the starting electronic hamiltonian . before proceeding to a detailed analysis of these models ( sec .",

    "there is thus no need to consider correlated hopping processes occurring on both @xmath12axis bonds simultaneously ( which are in fact available only for the @xmath61 states of all four bonds on the plaquette ) , as these are of order @xmath203 .",
    "thus at second order the plaquette  flipping matrix has the maximally sparse and inhomogeneous form @xmath204 this rather extreme form is due not only to the strict constraints set by the available color combinations , but also to the strong breaking of translational symmetry encoded in the choice of rhombic plaquette .    under these circumstances , it is necessary to consider the second  order contributions to the qdm @xmath7 term not contained in the dimer energy itself . from fluctuation processes on",
    "the three interdimer bonds one obtains @xmath205 the color constraint on the hopping possibilities is therefore sufficiently strong that the result is a diagonal @xmath7 matrix .",

    "restoration effects due to summing over all of the available plaquettes and orientations are of prime importance , and that in this sense the consideration of a qdm does not advance the general understanding beyond that obtained in ref .",
    "in the multicolored qdm , this strong breaking of symmetry will result in a selection process favoring only those dimer colors maximizing the contributions from quantum fluctuations , and hence in a system of @xmath199 and @xmath185 dimers on each active plaquette .    whether it is possible to select the preferred dimer colors",

    "iii , for models with no dimer number  mixing terms and fixed numbers of dimer of each color , the color sectors can not mix and the system is constrained to maximize its energy with the available number of colors of each dimer .",
    "while the ( os / st ) case , in which the dimer color corresponds to the physical spin , is indeed constrained by this type of criterion ( below ) , in the ( ss / ot ) case it is more straightforward to mix bond orbital sectors , as this can be done without changing the net electron orbital color balance , and therefore a selection of unequal numbers of @xmath206 states is not restricted .",

    "this places the system in the regime @xmath207 which is generically unsuitable for resonant states , and hence is the dominant physics deciding the ( static or dynamic ) nature of the ground state ; the type of static phase is in turn determined by the sign of @xmath7 . while it is again necessary to consider the restoration of translational symmetries broken rather crudely at the four  site plaquette level , it is difficult to conceive of circumstances under which this would bridge the gap , which includes changing the sign of @xmath7 , from the columnar phase to an rvb phase .        to conclude the analysis of this and the previous subsection , from effective qdms",
    "it appears very likely that the @xmath0 superexchange models on the triangular lattice favor `` columnar '' vbc states . in the ( ss / ot ) case",
    "this is a type of two  color model with plaquette  ordered ground states , while in the ( os / st ) case it is a three  color model with dimer  ordered ground states .",
    "these states break the symmetry both in real space ( lattice translation and rotation ) and in the space of dimer color .",
    "this result is a consequence of the fact that virtual fluctuations promoting dimer resonance are simply too restrictive ( in `` color '' , be this the orbital type or the real spin ) to be numerous enough to compete qualitatively with virtual fluctuations profiting from static order .          as demonstrated in sec .",
    "ii , in this model ( [ ehd0 ] ) the dimer overlap factor is @xmath224 .",
    "thus the model is naturally color  conserving .",
    "the conventional qdm plaquette terms are simply @xmath225 and the appropriate model is obtained from 6bond , 3dimer loops of the type shown in fig .  3 ( for which there are two orientations ) .",
    "these contribute at sixth order in the electronic hamiltonian , both to a @xmath74 term for processes returning to the starting configuration and to a @xmath73 term for correlated hopping processes in the same direction around the triangle , which lead to a net shift of the dimer positions . for clarity",
    "this is illustrated again in fig .",
    "11 , with the dimers retaining their color code ( which here , in contrast to the preceding subsections , does denote their orbital state ) .",
    "by analogy to the procedure mentioned above , fourth  order contributions to maintaining the static dimer configuration can also be renormalized into the energy of the dimer coverings ( whose extensive degeneracy is not affected by these ) . by writing out the wave functions for the triangle states , @xmath226 and proceeding in a manner analogous to the previous two subsections , one finds @xmath227 as above , the difference in magnitude between @xmath74 and @xmath73 arises due to the prevalence of connected processes not changing the dimer configuration over those leading to the specific resonance loop in question .",
    "thus once again this is a model strongly in the columnar limit : based on a predominant ordering pattern and profiting from limited fluctuations ( occurring only on selected generalized plaquette units ) .",
    "the meaning of the term `` columnar '' in standard qdm literature is a configuration maximizing the number of flippable plaquettes , which for the @xmath73@xmath74 model means the number of up and down  oriented triangles .",
    "examples are shown in fig .",
    "this columnar ground state has three possible color combinations , specifically those where any two colors are used in two triangles each , plus a triangle chirality , and hence is six  fold degenerate .",
    "it does not possess equal numbers of dimers of each color ( the ratio is 1:1:2 ) .",
    "a ground state of a macroscopic system may be expected to have a domain structure , and all states with equal dimer numbers will present defective versions of this phase .",
    "the overall energy gain of this state of the qdm relative to the original manifold ( which has @xmath228 ) is @xmath229 per plaquette , which in the present case of six  bond loops is @xmath230 per bond .",
    "however , because of the higher  order nature of this correction , it is not able to alter the conclusion@xcite that the one  dimensional solution , which has energy @xmath231 per bond , appears to lie lower than all dimer states .",
    "it is worth reiterating in this context that the present considerations are restricted to the case when @xmath34 is identically zero ; as noted in sec .",
    "ii , finite values of @xmath34 lead to the stabilization of particular static vbc configurations which promote energy gains of @xmath232,@xcite also insufficient to redress the energy balance .",
    "the prevalence of the one  dimensional solution in a geometry of such high connectivity is testimony to the enormous degree of orbital  induced frustration in the full physical system .",
    "this manuscript pursues , by mapping to a set of quantum dimer nodels ( qdms ) , the nature of the ground state of the @xmath0 spin  orbital model on the triangular lattice .",
    "the electronic hamiltonian , investigated in detail in ref .  [ ] , represents an insulating @xmath233 electron system on the @xmath234 planes of a system such as natio@xmath1 , where the cubic structural symmetry of edge  sharing metal  oxygen octahedra leads to an unbroken , threefold orbital degeneracy .",
    "this model was shown@xcite to have a very strong preference for dimer  based states of no long  ranged magnetic or orbital order over its entire parameter range in both the ratios @xmath76 ( of the direct and superexchange contributions to the magnetic interactions ) and @xmath235 ( of the hund coupling to the on  site coulomb repulsion ) .",
    "these dimer states were found to span a range of behavior from highly resonant in the superexchange limit to quasi ",
    "static in the direct  exchange limit . both cases present fundamental challenges in determining the nature of the true ground state :",
    "the former is a candidate resonating valence ",
    "bond ( rvb ) state and the latter a situation where subtle selection effects , sometimes known as `` order  by  disorder , '' are responsible for choosing the true ground state from a very highly degenerate manifold . in ref .",
    "[ ] only energetic studies were performed , which were unable to answer the topological questions associated with the formation of an rvb state or to resolve the possible differences among quasi ",
    "static valence  bond coverings .",
    "these questions are addressed by mapping the electronic hamiltonian to the minimal qdm for each of three cases : ( a ) the pure superexchange limit for low @xmath235 , ( b ) the pure superexchange limit for intermediate @xmath235 , and ( c ) the direct  exchange limit for @xmath236 . in case ( a )",
    ", the ground state is composed of spin  singlet , orbital  triplet ( ss / ot ) dimer entities and the effective qdm has three dimer `` colors '' corresponding to their orbital state . in case ( b ) , the ground state is composed of orbital  singlet , spin  triplet ( os / st ) dimers and the effective qdm has again three colors , which correspond to the triplet spin components of the dimers . in case ( c )",
    ", there are three dimer colors corresponding to the orbital colors active in each of the three bond directions of the triangular lattice , but because these are locked to each other , the color is not a degree of freedom and the effective qdm has one color .",
    "the `` non  orthogonality catastrophe '' which affects conventional spin dimers , namely that all dimer coverings have finite overlap , is shown to be very strongly reduced or completely eliminated in the presence of a dimer color in such models .    in order to analyze the properties of these specific qdms ,",
    "first the general multicolored qdm must be understood .",
    "this is investigated for the two  color case , with some additional consideration of three  color qdms where these contain further physics .",
    "both the potential term @xmath7 for adjacent dimers and the kinetic term @xmath6 for these to flip direction on the four  site plaquette they define become @xmath237 matrices , where @xmath238 is the number of colors .",
    "with such a choice of matrix elements , there remains only one rokhsar ",
    "kivelson ( rk ) point , where the equally weighted superposition of all possible dimer coverings ( in a given topological sector ) is an eigenstate , but the regime of parameters in which this ( gapped , rvb ) state is the ground state is expanded considerably .",
    "trivial topological sectors are found for specific choices of matrix elements , notably those conserving the total number of dimers of each color and those which allow this to be altered not in single steps but in units of two .",
    "this gives rise to topological excitations related to the color degree of freedom , which are termed `` color visons . ''",
    "the matrix elements @xmath239 and @xmath240 are deduced from the electronic hamiltonian for cases ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the restrictions on hopping of electrons of different orbital color and the breaking of translational symmetry contained in the consideration of four  site plaquettes lead in case ( a ) to very sparse and asymmetric matrices .",
    "this asymmetry selects only the @xmath8 orbital triplet states , and the model is reduced to one with two colors . in case ( b ) , the physical spin defines `` topological '' sectors which can not mix . in both cases , elements of the @xmath7 matrix",
    "are generally rather larger than those of the @xmath6 matrix , and have in addition a negative sign .",
    "thus the mapping to a qdm indicates strongly that the ground state of both models is a `` columnar '' plaquette phase , one which is based on a small subset of static dimer coverings which maximize the number of flippable four  site plaquettes : this number is 1/12 of the total in case ( a ) and 1/6 in case ( b ) .",
    "while these states gain energy from virtual dimer flipping processes ( quantum fluctuations ) , such processes are not sufficiently strong that they can `` melt '' the plaquette or dimer order in favor of a completely resonant , symmetry  restored phase .    in case ( c ) ,",
    "the overlap matrix elements , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 elements , on a four  site plaquette are identically zero .",
    "the leading quantum fluctuation processes for dimer resonance occur on six  site , triangular units containing one dimer of each bond direction , and hence the corresponding minimal qdm is a @xmath73@xmath74 model defined on these `` plaquettes '' .",
    "once again , @xmath74 is negative and larger in magnitude than @xmath73 , suggesting that the ground state of the system is again a generalized columnar covering ( meaning one which maximizes the number of flippable triangles ) .",
    "these are illustrated and shown to have a six  fold degeneracy , corresponding to the bond direction and the triangle chirality .    in summary ,",
    "effective qdms are used to obtain indications as to the nature of the ground state of a complex electronic hamiltonian for a spin ",
    "orbital model which is known to have no conventional magnetic or orbital order . in all cases of most interest",
    ", the ground state is found to be a resonance",
    " stabilized spin ",
    "orbital vbc covering which maximizes quantum fluctuation processes on a restricted set of plaquettes , but does not allow the melting of a preferred order by these fluctuations . while the derivation of a qdm involves rather crude symmetry  breaking at the level of four ( or six)site plaquettes , and the symmetry  restoring effects of fluctuations across all available plaquettes must be borne in mind , the columnar phases deduced from all three qdms are quite robust , indicating that there is no nearby liquid phase .",
