    "global and local , private and public institutions increasingly rely on numerical indexes for their decision making processes",
    ". a single index may be the difference between approval or rejection .",
    "these indexes , and even the mathematical models behind them , are often made public to enhance transparency , accountability , and establish standards .",
    "the usefulness of an index is measured by the successes and failures of decisions based on it .",
    "thus index creation , computation , selection , comparison , evaluation , and consolidation has become an industry of its own , and an integral part of institutionalized decision making processes .",
    "+ in this work we address the problem of finding suitable indexes for ranking countries according to their influences on the international trade market . in this case",
    "there is an obvious candidate : the influence of a country on the international trade market is proportional to the amount ( counted in us dollars ) of its international trade , i.e. the total amount of imports plus the total amount of exports .",
    "this primordial index is sound and should not be overlooked .",
    "nevertheless , we claim that it disregards some subtle but important issues .",
    "+ suppose we have a couple of countries @xmath0 and @xmath1 both with high levels of international trade , so that they both are highly ranked with the above index .",
    "suppose in addition that @xmath0 and @xmath1 trade essentially with each other , i.e. trade of @xmath0 and @xmath1 with other countries is negligible in comparison with trade between themselves . in this case",
    "our feeling is that @xmath0 and @xmath1 do not exert a strong influence on the international trade market : a disruption on @xmath0 s economy will surely impact @xmath1 s economy , but will have a negligible impact on global trade .",
    "countries @xmath0 and @xmath1 although highly interdependent are in fact quite isolated from the rest of the world , and should not be ranked as highly influential countries in the international trade market .",
    "+ to address this sort of issues we take a network approach @xcite to our index creation problem . in section [ stn ] , we regard the international trade market as a weighted network with nodes representing countries , edges representing trade between countries , and weights measuring the influence that a country exerts on another country trough trade . indeed , in sections [ dit ] and [ dio ] , we are going to introduce a couple of different weights leading to a couple of rankings .",
    "+ once we have established the network settings for approaching our index creation problem , we face the problem of ranking nodes in a network by their influence .",
    "this demands that we paid attention to the distinction between direct and indirect influences in a network , a distinction emphasized by godet and his collaborators @xcite , who stressed the power of studying indirect influences for uncovering hidden relations .",
    "direct influences in a network arise from directed edges .",
    "indirect influences in a network arise from chains of direct influences , i.e. from directed paths .",
    "+ let us consider an extreme case that illustrates the importance of taking indirect influences into account .",
    "cuba and the united states ( us ) have a fairly weak amount of trade , indeed since 1960 the us has placed a series of economic , financial , and commercial prohibitions to trade with cuba .",
    "thus a fairly low influence of the us on the cuban economy is to be expected .",
    "however , the us trades with cuba s main trading partners , and so we may expect that the us exerts a stronger indirect influence on the cuban economy than what one may naively think",
    ". simply put , a disruption of the us s economy will likely impact the spaniard economy , and trough spain it will also be felt by the cuban economy .",
    "the main challenge that we confront in this work is to give a quantitative account of the latter impact . +",
    "after building our mathematical models in sections [ stn ] trough [ hiitn ] , we proceed in sections [ secactn ] and [ wtn2 ] to implement them using real world data . out of united nations",
    "member states we restrict our attention to 177 countries , namely , those that have recent data available in the economic commission for latin america and the caribbean ( eclac ) web site @xcite .",
    "we collect the 2011 data of exports and imports between each pair of countries , as well as the gdp , and the exports and imports totals for each country . using this data",
    "we build the `` international trade network , '' where nodes are countries , and a pair of nodes is connected by an edge if there were exports or imports between them in 2011 .",
    "suppose there actually was trade between countries @xmath0 and @xmath1 , then we define a couple of weights on the edge from @xmath0 to @xmath1 as follows :    1 .   * direct influences on trade .",
    "* this weight computes the proportion of the international trade of @xmath1 ( exports + imports ) that involves country @xmath2 + 2 .   * direct influences on offer .",
    "* this weight computes the relative contribution of the trade between @xmath0 and @xmath1 to the offer of @xmath1 ( gdp + imports ) .    to take indirect influences into account we start from a trade network , with one of the weights just introduced , and apply one of the mathematical methods available for computing indirect influences in complex networks . with any of these methods",
    "one goes beyond computing direct trade between countries @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and takes as well into account trade chains @xmath3 such that country @xmath4 trades with country @xmath5 .",
    "+ in this work we weight chains of trade using the pwp method introduced by daz @xcite . to place this method whiting a general context and for the reader convenience we provide a in section [ mcii ] a succinct description of four closely related methods for computing indirect influences , namely , godet s micmac , google s pagerank , chung s heat kernel , and the pwp method . for more details on the similarities and differences among these methods",
    "the reader may consult @xcite .",
    "our choice of the pwp method rest on the fact that with it any chain of direct influences , of any length , generates indirect influences , and reciprocally , all indirect influences are generated in this fashion .",
    "+ thus we obtain several rankings among nations using the methodology outlined above : for each of the above weights we get the direct and indirect influences rankings .",
    "we compare these rankings among themselves and with the gdp ranking for the american continent trade network in section [ secactn ] , and for the world trade network in section [ wtn2 ] .",
    "we show that there are remarkable differences between the various rankings , and analyse them in economic terms .",
    "+ we remark once again that our economic data refers to year 2011 , and is measured in us dollars . when we compare different indexes what is really at stake is to compare the rankings they induce . in practice what we do is to compare the corresponding normalized indexes .",

    "indeed we have that @xmath76 * the greater the gdp of a country , the lesser its dependence on other countries .",
    "let us compute the china - us bilateral influences on offer .",
    "the gdp of china and us amounted in 2011 to 7,321,935,025 @xmath68 14,991,300,000 , respectively .",

    "these increments in indirect vs direct influences are quite remarkable since , as we shall see in section [ wtn2 ] , the us has decreasing global indirect influences both on trade and on offer . +",
    "the increments in indirect influences come from the fact that , beyond direct trade , the us also influences cuba trough chains of direct trade , which in the simplest case take the form of triangulations .",
    "for example , in figure [ e1 ] we show the triangle of direct influences us - spain - cuba : the us exerts a direct influence on spain in trade and offer of @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively ; in turn , spain exerts a direct influence on cuba in trade and offer of @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "thus it is quite clear that the us economy exerts an indirect influence on the cuban economy trough spain .",
    "+        computing indirect influences gives us a method for quantifying chains of direct influences . in the next sections we compute indirect influences on trade networks for a couple of scenarios",
    ": first we consider the american continent with 35 countries , and then we consider the world wide case with 177 countries . in both cases",

    "this generates various indexes for gauging influences in international trade .",
    "we make a comparative analysis of the different rankings when applied to these scenarios .",
    "we consider 35 countries located on the american continent ranging from mighty us to tiny dominica .",
    "the trade network for the american continent is a nearly complete graph with each country trading in average with 32.2 countries out of 34 possibilities .",
    "the fully connected countries are argentina , brazil , canada , colombia , costa rica , cuba , dominican republic , ecuador , guatemala , jamaica , mexico , peru , salvador , and the us .",
    "the lesser connected countries are bolivia , dominica , haiti , and paraguay , trading respectively with @xmath93 and @xmath94 countries .",
    "+ the american continent trade network , shown in figure [ casa ] , was drawn with sage using the matrix @xmath26 of direct influences on offer from definition [ ddio ] .",
    "+        [ atnit ]        the first thing one notices from the table in figure [ g2 ] is that the us , as expected , leads both in direct and indirect influences .",
    "one , however , may wonder why its direct influences are higher than its indirect influences ?",
    "this happens , we believe , for a couple of reasons : 1 ) because of its leading role , the us is more likely to trade with countries otherwise isolated with little influence on other countries .",
    "2 ) since influences are normalized , the decreasing indirect influences of the us may also be explained by the opposite behaviour in countries such as canada and mexico , whose indirect influences increase to a good extend precisely because of their special relation ( nafta agreement ) with the leading country .",
    "+ note that brazil has higher direct influences than both canada and mexico , this is to be expected since brazil s gdp is only second to the us s in the american continent . nevertheless , brazil has lesser indirect influences than both canada and mexico .",
    "this is due to the fact that in comparison brazil is an inward looking economy , and does not have a privileged relation with the leading country .",
    "+ the case of chile is interesting as well .",
    "its direct influences are quite modest , since chile has a relatively small economy .",
    "however , it has a noticeable increment in indirect influences , due to the fact that chile has an export - oriented economy .",
    "+ trinidad and tobago ( tt ) is perhaps the most revealing case .",
    "its small size economy seems hardly compatible with its high direct influence , and to make this case even more intriguing its indirect influences decrease quite sharply .",
    "this curious situation may be explained as follows .",
    "our indices measure influences on countries , and tt exerts a direct influence on quite a few low gdp countries , mostly caribbean community ( caricom ) member states .",
    "since caricom s countries have small economies the influence of tt on them may be quite high , even if tt has itself a relatively small economy . on the other hand , many caricom member states have low direct influences , so they seldom contribute to the indirect influences of tt . in summary , the difference between direct and indirect influences of tt attests to both the leadership of tt within caricom , and the meager impact of the subregion in the economy of the american continent at large .",
    "+ considering influences on trade in the american continent , see figure [ g1 ] , we find even less correlation between direct and indirect influences .",
    "canada and mexico indirect influences increase quite sharply , while for tt there is a deep fall instead .",
    "antigua goes from position @xmath95 in direct influences , to position @xmath96 in indirect influences .",
    "bolivia has the opposite behaviour going from position @xmath97 in direct influences to position @xmath98 in indirect influences .",
    "the world trade network containing 177 countries distributed all around the globe , shown schematically in figure [ casawtn ] , was drawn feeding sage with the matrix of direct influences on offer from definition [ ddio ] .",
    "+ unsurprisingly , the world trade network contains a big highly connected component containing the vast majority of countries in the world , with the exception of a handful of commercially isolated countries such as buthan , guinea bissau , kiribati , samoa , tonga , and tuvalu . on average",
    "a country trades with @xmath99 countries , and there are @xmath100 countries each trading with at least @xmath101 countries .",
    "+        we proceed to address a couple of questions concerning the world trade network : are gdp and direct or indirect influences correlated ?",
    "are there significative differences between direct and influences ?",
    "these question are both analyzed by looking first to influences on offer , and then influences on trade . instead of a statistical analysis",
    "we simply highlight interesting cases regarding the top 20 countries in indirect influences .",
    "+ naturally , we expect high gdp countries to have high direct and indirect influences on offer , and indeed there is a generic tendency for this correlation to hold , however the actual data reveals a far more subtle situation , see figure [ casag2 ] .",
    "+ japan has the @xmath102rd largest world gdp , but occupies the @xmath103th and @xmath104th places in direct and indirect influences , respectively .",
    "canada is in the @xmath95th place in the gdp ranking , but occupies the 20th and 21st positions in the direct and indirect influences rankings , respectively .",
    "similarly , mexico is in the 14th place in the gdp ranking , but 34th and 31st positions in direct and indirect influences .",
    "the drop in influences compared to gdp in the latter cases is probably consequence of canada s and mexico s strong economic ties to the us , so their influences are somewhat diluted in the us high gdp .",
    "+ comparing direct and indirect influences on offer , see figure [ casag2 ] , we find countries with similar results in both rankings , for example brazil , italy , switzerland , and korea .",
    "there are countries with diminishing indirect influences as australia , china , india , russia , singapore , south africa , thailand , united arab emirates and the us . in the case of south africa and",
    "even more so for thailand the decreases are quite sharp .",
    "there are also countries with raising indirect influences as germany , france , japan , united kingdom , netherlands , belgium and spain . as a rule",
    "european countries tend to have increasing indirect influences , the case of germany being remarkable because a sharp increase occurs .",
    "+ next we consider direct and indirect influences on trade in the world trade network , see figure [ casagra ] . in this case",
    "we expect less correlation with the gdp ranking , since we are looking at influences on international trade and disregarding domestic trade .",
    "for example , netherlands climbs from position @xmath105 in gdp to position @xmath104 in indirect influences on trade .",
    "similarly , belgium occupies the @xmath100th position in gdp , but raises to the @xmath106th position in indirect influences on trade . in the opposite trend , brazil is in the @xmath107th place in gdp , but is in the @xmath105th position in indirect influences on trade .",
    "+        from figures [ casag2 ] and [ casagra ] , it is quite clear that influences on trade measure a different thing that influences on offer , even if the us , china , germany and france , in this order , remain the top 4 countries in both rankings .",
    "for example , south africa , thailand , and the united arab emirates are not longer in the top 20 countries in influences on trade , and are replaced by canada , mexico and poland .",
    "observe that brazil , japan , korea , netherlands , spain , and the united kingdom climb in their ranking positions , belgium remains stable , and australia , india , italy , russia , singapore , and switzerland fall in their rankings positions .",
    "+ similarly , direct and indirect influences on trade are weaklier correlated than direct and indirect influences on trade .",
    "only france , among the top 20 countries , have nearly identical direct and indirect influences on trade .",
    "australia , brazil , india , italy , russia , singapore , spain , switzerland , and the us have diminishing indirect influences , whereas belgium , canada , china , germany , japan , korea , mexico , netherlands , and the united kingdom have increasing indirect influences .",
    "the cases of germany and korea are interesting because of their sharp increments .",
    "+        below we show the indirect dependence - influence planes , both for trade and offer , of the world trade network .",
    "note that the united states and china have high influence and low dependence on offer , while they have both high influence and dependence on trade , this is due to their high gdps .",
    "in contrast , germany have high influence and high dependence both on offer and on trade .",
    "in this work we developed a network viewpoint leading to a couple of ways of ranking direct influences of countries in the international trade market , namely , a ranking based on trade and another ranking based on offer .",
    "the first ranking measures relative international trade trough exports and imports , while the second ranking also takes into account domestic trade trough gdps . +",
    "as far as we can tell a network approach to international trade taking into account indirect influences has not been designed so far .",
    "most studies found in the literature gauge direct influences as evidenced by trade accounts . in this regard , they compare to our networks of direct influences in trade , rather than to our networks of indirect influences in trade . we showed that taking in consideration indirect influences may lead to more realistic indexes , as relevant cases suggest . + we computed indirect influences using the pwp method , and applied it to the american continent trade network and to the world trade network .",
    "thus we obtained new rankings and the corresponding dependence - influence planes .",
    "+        part of the motivation for this work is the high public interest in ranking countries for their centrality in international trade .",
    "various rankings have been introduced , some quite sophisticated such as the dhl global connectedness index @xcite .",
    "this ranking however results from the integration of many features , whereas our rankings focus on a single feature enhanced by taking into account indirect influences . + the problem of further integrating the various rankings proposed in the literature may be attacked by thinking of the set of rankings as a finite metric space .",
    "for example , we can define a suitable normalized euclidean distance between indices @xmath108 $ ] ( with @xmath109 and @xmath110 being the ranking positions of country @xmath0 according to @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively ; and @xmath22 is the total number of countries ) given by @xmath113 furthermore , we also have the problem of consolidating the various indexes into just one index .",
    "+ we applied our methods for computing indirect influences to trade networks at the level of countries .",
    "it should however be clear that these methods may also be applied at the business level , and even at the individual level . in the latter cases ,",
    "finding reliable data at a global scale and managing such huge data are daunting problems .",
    "nevertheless , our methods can be readily applied if one focusses on specific business sectors , just like we made a focus study of indirect influences on trade and offer in the american continent .",
    "+ the models presented in this work were static , in the sense that our data referred to just one year , namely 2011 .",
    "nevertheless , our techniques may be extended to a multiple years dynamical model in which influences are time depended functions ."
