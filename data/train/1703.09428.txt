    "<S> applying ac driving , on the other hand , may result in an invalid distribution . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ohmic_1](b ) , a strong ac driving with @xmath104 ( solid curves ) and @xmath119 leads to negative values of @xmath103 for both @xmath112 ( blue curves ) and @xmath113 ( red curves ) , violating positivity . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the ac driving is weak ( @xmath106 , dashed curves ) , the validity of @xmath105 still holds .    </S>",
    "<S> _ nonclassicality of the dynamics_.@xmath0hereafter , we suggest a physical interpretation of ( quasi)distributions with negative values in terms of witnesses of nonclassicality of the system dynamics with reservoir interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is distinct from other definitions of the nonclassicality of the dynamics focusing on the output states @xcite . in these approaches , </S>",
    "<S> the nonclassicality of the dynamics is traced back to the nonclassicality of the output states . </S>",
    "<S> typically , the nonclassicality of the states is then captured by the wigner function @xcite or the glauber - sudarshan @xmath2 representation @xcite , which may become negative for a state configuration without classical counterpart @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that , even though being genuine quantum states , coherent states are conceived to be classical - like , due to the positivity of their wigner function .    for a total state of the form ( [ eq : total_state_evolution ] ) , the system - environment correlation is fully classical , neither displaying quantum discord nor entanglement at any later time . in such case , where the system dynamics ( of an arrangement ) can be simulated by a hamiltonian ensemble , it is impossible to decide whether the dynamics follows from a system - environment interaction or such time - independent hamiltonian ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore regard this case to be classical - like , as it refers to classical correlations . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , if it is not possible to construct a suitable hamiltonian ensemble to simulate the system dynamics , the latter must be governed by quantum correlations between the system and the environment . in such case </S>",
    "<S> , one may say the quantum correlations are witnessed by the impossibility to construct the simulation .    for the spin - boson model discussed above , </S>",
    "<S> the unital dynamical behavior is classical - like in the absence of an external drive , due to the existence of a hamiltonian ensemble simulation . </S>",
    "<S> applying a strong drive can break this possibility to simulate , witnessing the nonclassicality of the system - environment correlations .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions_.@xmath0inspired by the analogy between open quantum systems and hamiltonian ensembles , we illuminated their correspondence from various perspectives . </S>",
    "<S> first , we considered a general class of system - environment arrangements and identified sufficient conditions , under which the total hamiltonian gives rise to a hamiltonian ensemble decomposition . while these conditions are not met in the spin - boson model , we nevertheless then constructed , on a more abstract level , an appropriate hamiltonian ensemble to simulate its unital pure dephasing dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that this possibility to simulate is broken in the presence of a strong external drive . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that such existence / non - existence of a simulating hamiltonian ensemble may establish a new way to assess the nonclassical nature of dynamical processes .    </S>",
