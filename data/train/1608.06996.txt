    "the notion of _ vector subtraction games _ was introduced by golomb @xcite , motivated by methods in computer science .",
    "( concerning shift - registers)then , much later the game family reappeared @xcite under a different name ( invariant subtraction games ) and now the motivation was a conjecture in number theory .",
    "( concerning complementary beatty sequences).the proposed problem was solved @xcite by introducing the normal - play _ @xmath0-operator _ on the class of games , and subsequently , some very general properties of this @xmath0-operator were discovered @xcite .",
    "all this work was done using the so - called normal - play convention for impartial combinatorial games @xcite . here",
    "we introduce the @xmath0-operator under the _ misre - play _ convention and prove some general properties .",
    "let us begin by using an example of a game in one dimension ( those are usually just called subtraction games ) .",
    "imagine two players who alternate in removing tokens from a single heap , subject to the rules that either 4 or 9 tokens be removed , and that if you can not move , you win ( _ misre - play _ ) . in this particular game the first player to move wins if there are less than 4 tokens in the pile , because these positions are terminal , and if there are between 4 and 7 tokens , then the other player wins . by a recursive procedure",
    ", one computes the pattern of p - positions ( these are the starting positions from which the current player can not win given optimal play ) .",
    "the initial pattern of p - positions is shown in the first line of figure  [ fig : exgame ] and the sequence is periodic as illustrated ( on the 0th line we show the allowed moves of this game ) .",
    "since the underlying structure of the moves and the p - positions is the same ( the non - negative integers ) , one can play a new game where the p - positions of the first game are used as moves in the new game , and this rule defines the @xmath0-operator .",
    "the new set of moves is then @xmath1 the p - positions of this new game are shown on the second row of figure  [ fig : exgame ] . by iterating this process",
    "we get a sequence of games where the moves in the next game consist of the p - positions of the previous game ( this is the @xmath0-operator to be defined formally below ) .    .",
    "the values at level @xmath2 represent the p - positions of the game whose moves are listed on level @xmath3 .",
    "they become the allowed moves in the @xmath2th game . ]    in figure  [ fig : exgame ] , the games shown on rows 4 and 5 have the same moves , and one of the results in this paper is that the sequence of games converges to a limit game , for any choice of the initial set of moves , and in any dimension .    we also show that the limit game is the same for any two games ( in the same dimension ) if the set of smallest ( in the natural partial order ) moves is the same . that the set of smallest moves remains fixed for any number of applications of the @xmath0-operator is direct by definition of the misre - play @xmath0-operator and this property is fundamental in distinguishing the @xmath0-operator s behavior from that of normal-play.moreover , the limit game is reflexive , and we show that it can be defined ( non - recursively ) by a simple `` sum - set '' rule .",
    "this is the third main result of this paper .",
    "we have started preliminary work on two dimensions and have obtained partial structure results , which we will discuss in the section on future work .",
    "we now explain the basic concepts and definitions .",
    "let @xmath4 denote the positive integers , and @xmath5 the non - negative integers .",
    "unless otherwise stated , @xmath6 will be a misre play game on @xmath7 heaps ( dimension @xmath8 ) , and we use calligraphy notation for sets when we want to indicate that we think of a subset of vectors as a game .",
    "all games we consider are impartial and of the following form , e.g. @xcite .",
    "[ def : game ] let @xmath7 , and let @xmath9 be the set of moves . in the _ @xmath8-dimensional vector subtraction game _",
    "@xmath6 , a player can move from position @xmath10 to position @xmath11 if @xmath12 .",
    "a position @xmath13 for which @xmath12 is called an _ option of _ @xmath14 .",
    "we consider the misre - play version of the game , that is , a player who can not move wins .",
    "note that when we talk about a game , we refer to its rule set or _",
    "subtraction set _ , and we are interested to determine for all positions whether they are p- or n - positons .",
    "we are not interested in finding optimatial strategies from a starting position , but rather want to investigate the patterns of the set of p - positions .",
    "since our games are multidimensional , we use the natural partial order on @xmath15 , namely @xmath16 if and only if @xmath17 for @xmath18 , and @xmath19 if and only @xmath16 with strict inequality holding for at least one component .    a non - empty subset @xmath20 of a partially ordered set",
    "@xmath21 is a _ lower ideal _ if for every @xmath22 , @xmath23 implies that @xmath24 .",

    "[ obs:1 ] for any game @xmath6 , in any dimension , the set of terminal positions is a lower ideal , and , moreover , @xmath30 .",
    "it is well - known that for impartial games without cycles ( that is , no repeated game positions ) , there are exactly two _ outcome classes _ , called n and p  @xcite . in misre - play",
    ", they are characterized as follows : a position is an n - position if it has no option , or if there is at least one p - position in its set of options .",
    "otherwise , a position is a p - position . in other words , a position is a p - position if and only if its set of options is a non - empty set of n - position .",
    "we denote the set of n - positions of a misre - play game @xmath6 by @xmath31 , and the set of p - positions by @xmath32 .",
    "note that in definition  [ def : game ] , we allow @xmath33 and also the case @xmath34 ( that is , a pass move is allowed ) . if @xmath34 , then each position can be repeated so the outcome is a draw , and hence @xmath35 .",
    "this trivial draw game was originally included in the definition of normal - play vector subtraction games by golomb @xcite , a definition not used in connection with the @xmath0-operator . ] .",
    "it is not very interesting from a game player s perspective , but from a theoretical point of view , as we will see , there is no reason to exclude it .",
    "similarly , if @xmath33 , then @xmath35 , because all positions are n - positions due to the misre convention .    on the other hand , if @xmath36 , then we get a recursive definition of the outcomes of all positions from the characterization of n- and p - positions above , and by observation  [ obs:1 ] , recurrence starts with n - positions .",
    "moreover observe that any smallest move @xmath37 is a p - position , so in this case @xmath38 .",
    "in fact , each game @xmath6 has a unique set of minimal elements which we denote by @xmath39 , consists of a single value and we sometimes abuse notation and write the minimal number instead of the set .",
    "if @xmath33 then we define @xmath40 . ]",
    "and we have the following fundamental observation .    [ obs:2 ] for any game @xmath6 , in any dimension ,",
    "if @xmath41 , then @xmath42 .",
    "since the underlying structure of moves and p - positions is the same ( sets of integer vectors ) , we can iteratively create new games @xcite .",
    "[ def : star ] let @xmath6 be a game in any dimension . then @xmath43 is the game with subtraction set @xmath44 .",
    "this defines the _ misre - play @xmath0-operator - operator under misre rules is the same as the @xmath0-operator in normal - play @xcite .",
    "however , since in misre - play @xmath45 is never a p - position , the definition simplifies in this case . ] _ which acts on impartial subtraction games - operator is in fact an infinite class of operators , one operator for each dimension .",
    "however , we will refer to `` the '' @xmath0-operator because the operator acts in the same way in each dimension . ] . a p - position in game @xmath6",
    "becomes a move in game @xmath46 ( and an n - position in @xmath6 becomes a non - move in game @xmath46 ) .",
    "we can now study properties of sequence of games created by repeated application of the @xmath0-operator .",
    "first we define special sequences of games , obtained by the fixed points of the operator .",

    "vector subtraction games that have the same sets of p - positions have been studied before ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we will be particularly interested in games for which the set of p - positions is a reflexive game , which motivates the following definition .",
    "given misre or normal - play convention , we call a set of games @xmath60 @xmath61-_solvable _ if , for all @xmath2 , @xmath62 .",
    "if @xmath63 contains all such games ( that is , @xmath64 implies @xmath65 ) , then we say that the set of games @xmath63 is @xmath61-_complete_.    in the next section we expand on the one heap example from figure  [ fig : exgame ] .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : conv ] , we show properties related to convergence in any dimension . in section  [ sec : oneheap ] , we discuss structure results on one heap . in section  [ sec : twoheaps ] , we indicate future directions on two heaps of tokens .",
    "we begin by illustrating our results on reflexive games and their limit behavior via the following examples of play on one heap .",
    "figure  [ fig : onedim ] shows the result of applying the @xmath52-operator five times to two different games . on the left ,",
    "the move set is @xmath66 , while on the right , it is @xmath67 ( same as in figure  [ fig : exgame ] ) .",
    "note that both sets have the same minimal move , @xmath68 .",
    "figure  [ fig : onedim ] suggests that both games converge to the same limit game , which exhibits a periodic structure : it consists of groups of @xmath69 consecutive integers , and the smallest values in consecutive groups differ by @xmath70 .",

    "therefore , the set of positions whose outcome class remains unchanged from iteration to iteration increases in each step , and any values already in the set of  fixed \" positions can not become  unfixed \" .",
    "figure  [ fig : conv ] shows the first five iterations of the game @xmath67 .",
    "the rectangles identify the smallest elements that differ when comparing @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "for example , for games @xmath76 and @xmath77 , the smallest differing element is @xmath78 . for @xmath76 ,",
    "@xmath78 is not a move , but for @xmath77 ( and all subsequent games ) it is .",
    "similarly , the smallest differing element when comparing @xmath77 and @xmath79 is @xmath80 , which is a move in @xmath77 , but then becomes fixed as a non - move in @xmath79 and subsequent games .",

    "as we have seen , the definition of the @xmath0-operator does not depend on the given dimension , and as we will see , neither does its most notable property , convergence to a fixed point , the class of reflexive games being the fixed points of the operator .",
