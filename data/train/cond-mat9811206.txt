    "a ferromagnetic particle becomes monodomain if its size @xmath1 is reduced below a critical value @xmath2 , determined by the competition between dipole and exchange energies @xcite . below this critical size ,",
    "the energy loss due to creation of magnetic domain walls ( proportional to @xmath3 ) is larger than the gain due to disappearance of the dipole magnetic field energy ( proportional to @xmath4 ) .",
    "such monodomain ferromagnetic particles can be viewed as large magnetic units , each having a magnetic moment of thousands bohr magnetons .",
    "usually neighboring particles are well separated ( @xmath5 @xmath6 ) , and direct exchange between particles may be neglected .",
    "thus , the magnetic properties of an assembly of nanoparticles are determined by the dipole field energy along with thermal and magnetic anisotropy energies ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "experiments conducted on magnetic nanoparticles show irreversible magnetic behavior below the  irreversibility line  @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , the zero - field cooled ( zfc ) and field cooled ( fc ) magnetization curves do not coincide , and magnetic hysteresis appears in @xmath8 vs. @xmath9 curves ( see e. g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , time - logarithmic magnetic relaxation , towards the thermodynamic equilibrium state , is observed below @xmath7 .",
    "similar observations are reported here for three systems of @xmath0 nanoparticles with different shape and crystalline magnetic anisotropies .",
    "these nanoparticle samples were prepared by a sonochemical method , which produces  regular  amorphous nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "sonochemical irradiation carried out in the presence of magnetic field results in synthesis of acicular amorphous nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "annealing of amorphous particles leads to crystallization . in this manner",
    "we have prepared regular amorphous , acicular amorphous and crystalline ferromagnetic nanoparticles .",
    "this enables a study of the effect of shape and crystalline anisotropies on magnetic irreversibility and the relaxation rate .",
    "we find that , qualitatively , all three samples exhibit similar irreversible magnetic behavior .",
    "however , their irreversibility lines and relaxation rates differ significantly",
    ".    irreversible magnetic behavior similar to that described here is also observed in other systems .",
    "a noticeable example is magnetic irreversibility in superconductors @xcite . in such systems the origin for irreversibility",
    "is the interplay between thermal energy and some energy barrier , which prevents magnetic reorganization in those materials .",
    "the microscopic origin of the barrier , however , depends on the system .",
    "the magnetic irreversibility in nanoparticles is conventionally associated with the energy required for a particle moment reorientation , overcoming a barrier due to magnetic shape or crystalline anisotropy .",
    "it is important to note that the barrier is considered to be independent of the magnetic moment itself @xcite . in superconductors ,",
    "magnetic irreversibility is due to the inevitable spatial fluctuation of the superconducting order parameter caused by defects , imperfections etc . ; the barrier is the energy required to overcome the pinning due to this disorder .",
    "an important concept in the theory of irreversible magnetic properties of superconductors , based on the work of anderson @xcite , is that the effective barrier for magnetic relaxation increases with time .",
    "this is because the superconducting shielding current ( proportional to the magnetization ) decays with time , causing a decrease in the lorentz force which drives the fluxons away of their positions . in a nice paper lottis _",
    "et al_. @xcite have put forward similar arguments to study slow dynamics .",
    "they noticed the close analogy between ferromagnetic assemblies and superconductors . analyzing the results of numerical computations they concluded that the decay of the demagnetizing field is the origin of what the  quasi - logarithmic  relaxation .",
    "although the distribution of particle sizes may explain quasi - time - logarithmic relaxation in a limited time - interval , it is not necessary for the explanation of the experimentally observed time - logarithmic relaxation .",
    "this approach was later employed in other studies of the magnetic relaxation , for example , in thin magnetic films @xcite .    in this work",
    "we adopt the concept of time varying barrier and derive the phenomenological model to explain magnetic irreversibility and logarithmic magnetic relaxation in nanoparticles .",
    "the physics for the time dependence of the barrier in nanoparticles is related to the fact that the effective barrier for reorientation of the magnetic moment of each nanoparticle depends on the internal magnetic field , which includes the average dipole field from surrounding nanoparticles .",
    "this average dipole field decreases with time due to the increase of randomness in the orientation of the magnetic moments of the surrounding nanoparticles .",
    "this , in turn , causes the increase of the effective barrier with time , yielding a natural explanation to the experimental observation of time - logarithmic relaxation , and a sample dependent irreversibility line and relaxation rate .",
    "interactions between particles as well as shape and crystalline magnetic anisotropies define a new energy scale that controls the magnetic irreversibility . introducing this energy scale yields a self - consistent explanation of the experimental data .",

    "magnetic relaxation is a distinct feature of systems with interacting particles , far from thermodynamic equilibrium . in an assembly of ferromagnetic nanoparticles ,",
    "the elementary process of a change in the magnetization is the rotation of the magnetic moment of a nanoparticle ( or cluster of such magnetic moments ) . in the following",

    "for such a system , the energy @xmath89 of each magnetic nanoparticle , neglecting for the moment the interparticle interactions , varies with the angle as @xcite :    @xmath90    here @xmath91 is the angle between the easy axis @xmath92 and the external magnetic field @xmath93 , and @xmath94 is the angle between the particle magnetic moment @xmath95 and the external field . in order to have any magnetic irreversibility and relaxation , the @xmath96 term in eq .",

    "since the magnetic anisotropy has no preferable direction , there are two minima in the angular dependence of the energy , as shown in fig . @xmath99 .",
    "the external magnetic field fixes the direction of the lowest minima .",
    "we denote by @xmath102 the barrier for reorientation from the lowest minima ( @xmath103 ) to the other minima ( @xmath104 ) .",

    "[ wsimple ] as the internal magnetic field , which is the sum of the external field and the dipole field from the surrounding nanoparticles .",
    "this local magnetic field depends on the directions of neighboring magnetic moments @xcite . since the magnetic moment is a statistical average of those moments , the local field depends , on the average , on the total magnetic moment .",
    "this induces a feedback mechanism : each reorientation of an individual nanoparticle decreases the total magnetic moment .",
    "this is illustrated in figs .",
    "@xmath88 . and @xmath107 .",
    "figure @xmath88 represents a snapshot of a field - cooled system of nanoparticles in which most of the individual magnetic moments are favorably oriented in a direction such that their projections are along the external field . after a field decrease , as a result of thermal fluctuations , some magnetic moments reorient so that their projection is anti - parallel to the external field .",
    "the open arrows in fig . @xmath107 represent those reoriented moments .",
    "since the local dipole field decreases during this process , the average barrier @xmath102 increases .",
    "as indicated in the introduction , an increase of the barrier with time is a characteristic of other irreversible systems , such as type - ii superconductors in the process of magnetic flux creep .",
    "the dynamics resulting from such a scenario is sketched fig . @xmath108 . immediately after reducing the magnetic field , individual magnetic moments are still along the direction of the external field , i. e. , in minima @xmath103 of fig .",

    "since , as discussed above , this barrier depends on the total magnetic moment via dipole fields , it will increase with time as shown in the figure , with dipole fields working on the average against the external field .",
    "the total magnetic moment along the magnetic field is thus decreased , as sketched in fig . @xmath107 .      in a realistic sample ,",
    "the directions of easy axes are randomly distributed , the particles can not physically rotate ( e. g. , in a dense powder of ferromagnetic nanoparticles ) , and dipole interactions are strong .",
    "we will model this situation as outlined below .",
    "any given particle @xmath109 in fig .",
    "@xmath110 has an anisotropy axis at a fixed angle @xmath111 relative to the external magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic moment of this particle is then oriented at an angle @xmath112 to the field .",

    "thermal fluctuations may force particle moment in the minima @xmath119 to change its direction to another minima @xmath120 and vise versa .",

    "[ u21 ] and [ us12 ] of the appendix , respectively .",
    "we then assume that the field @xmath113 can be represented as a simple sum of the external field @xmath9 and the collinear to @xmath9 dipole field @xmath124 ( i.e. independent of @xmath125 ) .",
    "the amplitude of a dipole field @xmath124 at any given site depends upon orientations of the moments of the surrounding particles .",
    "if those orientations are totally random ( minima @xmath103 and @xmath104 are equally occupied ) the dipole field is small , whereas if all surrounding particles are in one of the minima the resulting dipole field is maximal . from this simple analysis ,",
    "we conclude that the magnitude of a dipole field depends upon the total magnetic moment @xmath8 .",
    "considering the balance of forward and backward rotations , and averaging over the volume of the sample , we show in the appendix that magnetic relaxation is described by a differential equation similar to that derived for superconductors @xcite :    @xmath126    where @xmath127 is an attempt frequency and @xmath128 is an effective barrier for magnetic relaxation given by    @xmath129    where    @xmath130    and @xmath131 .",

    "it is worth noting that in our model the barrier @xmath138 depends on the magnetic moment in the same way as that used by anderson @xcite for a description of magnetic relaxation in superconductors .    in the following",
