    "the  spectrum of an unobscured , radio - quiet ( rq ) agn in the energy band is best characterized by a single power - law continuum of the form @xmath8 , where @xmath2 , hereafter the photon index in the energy band , typically lies in the range @xmath71.52.5 .",

    "2005 ; just et al .  2007 ) , and typically no strong dependence of @xmath2 on redshift or luminosity has been detected across the widest possible ranges of these parameters .",
    "on the other hand , a strong anticorrelation between @xmath2 and the full width at half - maximum intensity ( fwhm ) of the broad emission - line region ( belr ) component of h@xmath9  has been found , first by brandt et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the remarkable dependence between  and optical spectroscopic properties has been suggested to arise from a more fundamental correlation between @xmath2 and the accretion rate ( e.g. , brandt & boller 1998 ; laor 2000 ) .",
    "a high accretion rate is expected to soften ( steepen ) the hard-  spectrum by increasing the level of disk emission , resulting in the production of softer photons , which increase the compton cooling of the corona . using recent scaling relations for the belr size , luminosity , and the width of the broad h@xmath9  emission line from reverberation - mapping studies ,",
    "it is clear that the normalized accretion rate ( i.e. , @xmath10/@xmath11 , hereafter @xmath1 , where @xmath10  is the bolometric luminosity ) is proportional to fwhm(h@xmath9)@xmath12 , at least for low ",

    "they have also shown that the @xmath2 values of the five highly luminous sources in their sample , while consistent with the values expected from their normalized accretion rates ( @xmath1 ) , are significantly higher than expected from the widths of their broad h@xmath9  emission lines .",
    "this has enabled , for the first time , breaking of the fwhm(h@xmath9)-@xmath1degeneracy and has provided evidence that @xmath2 depends primarily on the accretion rate . however , the number of highly luminous sources was small , and as explained below , some uncertainties remained .    in this work ,",
    "we double the number of highly luminous sources at high redshift and reinforce the s06 results .",

    "( 2004 ) determination of @xmath10  ( whether from @xmath160 or @xmath3 ) relies , in part , on the very strong and non - linear @xmath3-@xmath157 dependence ( see  [ sec_sed ] ) .",

    "this scatter is inherent in the @xmath1-@xmath2 correlation as it reflects uncertainties in determining @xmath10  from @xmath164 and potential -optical variability .",
    "for example , when @xmath4  values for our core sample of 35 sources are recovered from @xmath1  using the bolometric corrections for @xmath165 , the ratio between these @xmath4  values and the original @xmath4  values obtained in  [ sec_l5100_hb ] is 1 , on average , with a dispersion of a factor of 2 . in an additional test",
    ", we used the @xmath2 and @xmath147 values of six nearby sources from our sample to recover their @xmath4values and compare them with the most recent , direct ( reverberation - mapping based ) @xmath4  measurements from peterson et al .",

    "high - quality  spectra may thus be useful for estimating the accretion rates and bh masses for moderate  high luminosity type  1 , rq agns and , in particular , for -selected sources .",
    "this method may allow tracing the history of bh growth in the universe by utilizing large agn datasets ( see e.g. , brandt & hasinger 2005 ) in which bh growth can not be determined effectively using existing methods [ i.e. , reverberation - mapping based methods ( aka single - epoch methods ) , e.g. , k05 , and host - agn type relations , e.g. , marconi & hunt ( 2003 ) ] , either due to the faintness of the sources in the optical  near - ir bands , or that the required spectroscopic features are either not accessible or can not be modeled reliably .",
    "one advantage of the -based method is the ability to obtain @xmath1  and @xmath4  by measuring broad spectroscopic properties ( i.e. , @xmath2 ) as opposed to detailed spectroscopy for obtaining the width of an emission line ( e.g. , h@xmath9  or ; this involves , for example , careful decontamination of emission features from the uv  optical spectra ) .",
    "moreover , measurements of the hard-  power - law spectral slope are typically not limited to specific redshift ranges , such as those dictated by atmospheric transmission bands ( and detector bandpass ) for ground - based spectroscopy .",
    "these advantages offer a way to obtaining many @xmath1  and @xmath4  estimates , economically , in contrast with more complicated ( and redshift - restricted ) spectroscopic measurements for individual sources done with existing methods .",
    "nevertheless , we caution that the  measurements of @xmath2 and @xmath3 should be done carefully to account for potential complex absorption and compton reflection .",
    "the -based method for estimating @xmath1  and @xmath4  may prove to be even more rewarding in cases where a source is either optically faint and/or the broad - emission lines are too weak to measure if , for example , these lines are overwhelmed by host - galaxy continuum ( e.g. , moran et al .",
    "2002 ; provided the source is not radio loud and that the redshift can be determined ) . in particular , this method may be the best way to determine @xmath1  and @xmath4  directly in obscured ( i.e. , optical type2 ) , moderate  high luminosity agns .",
    "provided the absorption column density is not too high ( @xmath24@xmath168cm@xmath12 ) and can be modeled accurately , the intrinsic hard-  power - law spectrum can , in principle , provide @xmath1  and @xmath4  as outlined above .",

    "2 agns comprise a significant fraction of the agn population , tracing the growth of the supermassive bhs in their centers using the -based method is crucial for testing models of the evolution of bh growth and accretion luminosity in the universe in an unbiased way .",
    "we present  spectroscopy for five highly luminous rq agns at @xmath0 , with accurate fwhm(h@xmath9 ) measurements that allow determinations of their @xmath4  and @xmath1  values .",
    "analysis of the  spectra provided measurements of the hard-  photon index in the rest - frame 2kev band and @xmath5 .",

    "our new highly luminous sources with fwhm(h@xmath9 ) measurements have allowed us to break the degeneracy between the dependence of @xmath2 on fwhm(h@xmath9 ) and on @xmath1 , suggesting that the accretion rate largely determines the hard-  spectral slope across four orders of magnitude in agn luminosity ( i.e. , @xmath169 { \\raisebox{-.5ex}{$\\;\\stackrel{<}{\\sim}\\;$}}48 $ ] ) .",
    "2 .   we found a significant correlation between @xmath1  and @xmath2 with a best - fit line of the form @xmath170 , and an acceptable uncertainty of a factor of 3 on a predicted value of @xmath1 .",

    "( 2006 ) and this work , we find that @xmath5  depends strongly on optical  uv luminosity and only weakly on @xmath1 ; the ( weak ) correlation with @xmath1  is probably due to the strong dependence .",
    "we discuss possible explanations for this result including the possibility that @xmath5  can not be used as an accretion - rate indicator based on its current definition .",
    "we find a significant compton - reflection feature in two of our sources , and the mean relative reflection for seven other sources is @xmath171 . by setting rather loose constraints on the strengths of  emission lines in our highly luminous sources",
    ", we can neither confirm nor rule out a suggested anticorrelation between ew ( ) and either luminosity or @xmath1 ; the upper limit on the mean rest - frame ew ( ) for seven of these sources that do not show compton - reflection features is 105ev .",
    "we have not detected any signature of a soft - excess component in any of our highly luminous sources , including two sources at @xmath172 where our rest - frame coverage extends to @xmath75kev , suggesting that the soft excess does not depend strongly on the accretion rate .",
    "although one of our highly luminous sources , lbqs0109@xmath210213 , exhibits long - term ( i.e. , on timescales of years ) variations , rapid  variations on timescales of @xmath71hr have not been detected in any of our highly luminous ( and high-@xmath4 ) sources , supporting the idea that  variability timescale depends inversely on @xmath4  and does not depend on @xmath1 .",
