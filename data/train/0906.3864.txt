    "in recent years various variants of erasure networks have been the focal point of many works in the fields of information theory , coding theory , communication , and digital signal processing ( dsp ) .",
    "it turns out that the idealization of situations where symbols are detectable with very high or very low probability is useful in providing accurate and tractable assessment of practical interest .",
    "applications of erasure networks , in general , and erasure channels , in particular , include packet - switched networks , wireless fading channels , impulse noise channels , and sensor networks with faulty transducers .",
    "another interesting dsp application is decimation using frequency shaped random erasures @xcite ( see also @xcite for a somewhat dual problem ) .",
    "the simplest non - trivial setting incorporating erasures is perhaps a memoryless discrete channel observed through a memoryless erasure channel . in this case",
    ", it is straightforward to see that the capacity of the concatenated channel is the capacity of the discrete channel times the erasure rate @xcite .",
    "moreover , even if the erasures have memory , the latter result holds @xcite @xcite .",
    "however , adding memory to the discrete channel changes the picture considerably .    in @xcite , tulino",
    "have calculated the capacity of an input power - constrained gaussian channel concatenated with a memoryless erasure channel .",
    "the problem requires obtaining the asymptotic spectral distribution of a sub - matrix of a nonnegative definite toeplitz matrix obtained by randomly deleting rows and columns .",
    "in addition , @xcite presents an explicit expression for the optimal input power spectral density ( psd ) function .",
    "asymptotic capacity expressions in various regimes such as extreme - snr , sporadic erasures events , and sporadic non - erasure events , are reported as well .",
    "in addition , several useful bounds ( lower and upper ) in closed form are presented .",
    "recently , the results of @xcite were extended in @xcite to include any flat fading distribution , not necessarily the on - off process obtained by erasures .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the input - erasure gaussian channel .",
    "according to this setup , erasures ( known at the receiver only ) are applied directly to the gaussian input of a linear time - invariante ( lti ) system ( e.g. a finite input response filter , fir ) , whose output samples are affected by additive gaussian noise . to simplify the analysis , we consider independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "input signaling , and show that in this case the input - erasure channel and the output - erasure channel of @xcite are equivalent . focusing on the case where the channel filter includes two taps , we present an alternative analysis to @xcite that obtains the achievable rate without relying on random matrix theory tools . the analysis is based on a simple observation that in the two - tap case , each erasure splits the output vector into two independent sub - vectors . in addition , it uses a useful property of tri - diagonal matrices , which states that their determinant can be expressed as a weighted sum of the determinants of their two main principal sub - matrices .",
    "it is also shown that the analysis can be extended to the case in which the erasures are not memoryless .",
    "the results are then used to find the achievable rate supported by a simple cellular uplink model ( where inter - cell interference is limited only to adjacent cells ) , in which the transmission of each mobile terminal ( mt ) undergoes erasures due to _ ergodic shadowing _ , which simultaneously blocks it from being received by all the base - stations ( bss ) .",
    "we show that with optimal joint decoding of the received signals from all the bss ( that is , multicell processing , mcp ) , the ergodic per - cell capacity of this cellular uplink equals the rate of the two - tap input - erasure channel considered earlier .",
    "the performance of mcp is compared to that of single - cell processing ( scp ) , demonstrating that the benefits of mcp decrease with the erasure rate ( the reader is referred to @xcite and @xcite for recent surveys on mcp ) .",
    "we then consider a similar cellular uplink setup but with a _ dynamic user activity _ model , in which each user is randomly active or silent for the whole transmission block . we show that with mcp the system throughput per active user is equal to the rate of the two - tap input - erasure channel divided by the probability of an arbitrary user being active .",
    "similar benefits of mcp over scp , as those reported for the shadowing scenario , are observed also for the user activity model .",
    "it is finally noted that a related analysis has been recently reported in @xcite , where the _ outage _ capacity supported by a similar cellular uplink and user activity model was derived with both mcp and scp .",
    "in this work we consider a channel ( see fig . [",
    "fig : iegc oegc schemes].a ) , where erasures @xmath0 , _ known to the receiver only _ , are applied to the inputs symbols @xmath1 of a discrete time lti system with transfer function @xmath2 . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that the lti system is causal and has a finite . ]",
    "impulse response of length @xmath3 symbols .",
    "accordingly , the received signal at time index @xmath4 , is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the impulse response coefficients such that @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the additive complex gaussian noise @xmath9 .",
    "the erasures @xmath10 , are assumed to be i.i.d .",
    "bernoulli distributed random variables ( r.v.s ) @xmath11 ( i.e. , @xmath12 ) .",
    "we consider transmissions in blocks of @xmath13 symbols .",
    "the received vector of an arbitrary block is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the @xmath16 output vector , @xmath17 is the complex gaussian @xmath18 input vector @xmath19 with average power constraint @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the @xmath22 diagonal erasure matrix , and @xmath23 is the @xmath16 noise vector @xmath24 . in addition",

    "unfortunately , finding the optimal covariance matrix and calculating is still an open problem .",
    "instead , we focus in the rest of this work on assessing achievable rates resulting by using i.i.d . inputs , hence , by setting @xmath33 .",
    "here we consider an arbitrary @xmath27-length fir filter and rewrite the logdet term of as : @xmath34 by noting that the left - hand - side ( lhs ) of the last equation is the same as the one resulting from the analysis of the output - erasure channel with i.i.d .",
    "inputs , considered in @xcite ( see fig . [",
    "fig : iegc oegc schemes].b ) , we can state the following .    the gaussian input - erasure and output - erasure channels with i.i.d . inputs are equivalent .",
    "this result implies that with i.i.d .",
    "inputs , both channels achieve the same rate . hence , all the results reported in @xcite hold verbatim for the input - erasure channel with i.i.d .",
    "inputs , by setting the psd accordingly ( i.e. , @xmath35 ) in the results of @xcite .",
    "the analysis in @xcite uses random matrix theory tools to derive the main result which is the rate of the output - erasure channel for any channel fir filter and any input psd .",
    "the rate result of @xcite involves a fixed - point integral equation and in general it is not explicitly formulated .",
    "next , we present an alternative analysis for the special case of i.i.d . inputs and a two - tap channel filter .",
    "the resulting rate expression is considerably different than that of @xcite , and may shed some further light on the problem .",
    "in this section we consider a two - tap channel filter ( i.e. , its impulse - response includes only two non - zero coefficient @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ) .",
    "hence , the channel transfer matrix @xmath39 reduces to a bi - diagonal toeplitz matrix . for this special case",
    "we have the following .    [ prop : two - tap iegc rate ] the achievable rate of the two - tap input - erasure gaussian channel with i.i.d .",
    "inputs is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42    see appendix    the proof relies on a simple observation that in the two - tap case , each erasure splits the output vector into two independent sub - vectors .",
    "in addition , it uses a useful property of tri - diagonal matrices , which states that their determinant can be expressed as a weighted sum of their first two main principal sub - matrices .",
    "it is noted that this analysis does not involve classical random matrix theory . moreover , since it relies heavily on the two - tap assumption , it can not be applied to input - erasure channels with filter lengths larger than two .",
    "examining the rate expression , a few comments are in place .",
    "although the rate expression is an infinite sum , any finite sum , which is evidently a lower bound , can be calculated numerically in a straightforward manner .",
    "in addition , convergence is assured since the expression is a power series and @xmath43 .",
    "it is also observed that the rate is independent of the filter coefficients phases , and hence , random phases ( known to the receiver ) can be added to the channel model without changing the end result . by applying hadamard s inequality directly to the covariance matrix @xmath44 ( see ) , it can be shown that for a fixed filter gain , filter memory reduces the rate . hence , the rate is maximized for a one - tap filter with equal gain . on this note , it is easily verified that for the special case of @xmath45 ( memoryless gaussian channel with erasures ) , @xmath46 and reduces to @xmath47 which was already reported in @xcite .",
    "another special case , which is also an upper bound , is the case where @xmath48 . the capacity of this two - tap channel with i.i.d .",
    "inputs is given by @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is defined in .",
    "turning to asymptotic analyses , we refer the reader to @xcite , where compact closed - form expressions are reported for the rate low - snr characterization , the rate with sporadic erasures , and the rate with sporadic non - erasures .",
    "these expressions can be used verbatim for the two - tap input - erasure channel of interest by setting i.i.d .",
    "inputs in @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite provides also the high - snr characterization of the output - erasure channel rate , albeit the calculation of the high - snr power offset involves a fixed point - equation . applying definitions of @xcite to the rate expression",
    ", we provide an alternative expression for the high - snr power offset as well .",
    "the two - tap input - erasure gaussian channel rate with i.i.d .",
    "inputs is characterized in the high - snr regime by @xmath51    and the deleterious effects of increasing erasure rate @xmath52 are clearly visible .      following the proof of prop .",
    "[ prop : two - tap iegc rate ] , it can be verified that the presented analysis method can handle also erasures with memory ( stationary and ergodic ) .",
    "the only stage that should be altered is the calculation of , that is , the probability of having an isolated sequence @xmath53 of @xmath4 consecutive non - erasures should be recalculated for the new erasure source .",
    "for example , assuming the erasures follow a first order markov chain with transition probabilities @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , it is easily verified that @xmath56 and the corresponding rate of the two - tap input erasure channel with i.i.d .",
    "inputs is given by @xmath57 as expected , for @xmath58 the erasure source is i.i.d . and reduces to .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the special case @xmath59 , which corresponds to a memoryless channel followed by an erasure channel with memory , the rate reduces to @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the steady - state erasure rate .",
    "this results is in agreement with @xcite , where it has been shown that the capacity of a concatenation of a discrete memoryless channel with capacity @xmath62 , and an erasure channel ( possibly with memory ) with erasure rate @xmath52 , is equal to @xmath63 .",
    "the rate ( [ eq : two tap iegc rate ] ) is plotted in figure [ fig : iegc rate vs q 1 ] as a function of the erasure rate @xmath52 , for several snr values , and filter coefficients @xmath64 .",
    "expression is calculated by taking 200 summands and is plotted with solid lines , while monte - carlo simulation results of 50 trials , each with block size of 200 symbols , are shown as well .",
    "examining the figure , the deleterious effect of erasures is evident .",
    "in addition , the figure demonstrates a good match between the monte - carlo simulations and the exact  results .",
    "similar conclusions can be obtained from figure [ fig : iegc rate vs snr 1 ] , which includes rate curves ( calculated from ( [ eq : two tap iegc rate ] ) as above ) as functions of the snr @xmath65 for several values of the erasure rate @xmath52 , and @xmath66 .",
    "in addition , the erasure - free ( @xmath48 ) rate curve is included as a reference .    in figure",
    "[ fig : iegc rate vs h0 1 ] the rate curves are plotted as functions of the filter coefficients @xmath67 for a unit gain filter ( i.e. , @xmath68 ) , and @xmath69 [ db ] .",
    "it is observed that the worst - case filtering corresponds to coefficients with equal amplitudes ( i.e. , @xmath70 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "as claimed earlier , best - case filtering is achieved for flat or memoryless channels ( i.e. , @xmath71 or @xmath71 ) . moreover , these observations are independent of the erasure rate @xmath52 .",
    "cellular systems are currently the main media to provide high - data rate services to mobile users .",
    "therefore , a continued search for techniques that provide better service and coverage in cellular systems is under way .",
    "a promising cooperation - based technique is joint mcp , proposed by wyner in @xcite .",
    "accordingly , clusters of bss jointly process their signals to mitigate or eliminate the overall interference , since more signals are useful . unlike conventional approaches that treats interference stemming from other cells as noise , or tries to avoids it , this approach ( also referred to as _ distributed antenna array _ ) exploits the interference to provide better rates to the clusters mts .",
    "here we are interested in further exploring the benefits of mcp when ergodic erasures affect the mts transmissions in the uplink .",
    "such erasures account for a scenario where an mt may undergo ergodic deep fading ( or shadowing ) such that its transmission can not be received by _ any _ of its cluster s antennas .    motivated by the fact that inter - cell interference is essentially limited to only a small number of bss , and with mathematical tractability in mind , we assume a synchronous wyner - like cellular uplink setup . according to this setup ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sho model ] ) , an infinite number of cells are arranged on a line , as along a highway .",
    "moreover , the each mt `` sees '' its own bs antenna ( with unit path gain ) , and the adjacent bs antenna ( with path gain @xmath72 $ ] ) only .",
    "this model , which was first introduced in @xcite , focuses on users lying on the cells boundaries and is thus sometimes referred to as the _ soft - handoff _ model . specifically , assuming a single active user per - cell ( intra - cell time - division multiple - access ) , the received signal at the @xmath4th bs antenna , for an arbitrary time index , is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the mts transmissions @xmath76 , @xmath10 and @xmath77 are the erasures @xmath78 , and @xmath8 is the additive noise @xmath79 .",

    "the simplest approach is for each cell to decode its own signals while treating the signals from the interfering cell as noise . assuming that each cell is aware of its own user s erasures and those of the interfering cell s user ( see @xcite for a similar setting ) , it is easily verified that the achievable rate is given by @xmath80\\ , \\ ] ] where the expectation is taken over @xmath81 and @xmath82 which represent arbitrary i.i.d .",

    "this is easily explained by noting that with probability @xmath87 the useful signal is received without interference .",
    "here we consider a more involved approach that requires static resource sharing between the cells .",
    "since , according to the soft - handoff model , interference stems from one cell only , by dividing the available bandwidth of @xmath88 [ hz ] into two orthogonal subbands with bandwidth of @xmath89 [ hz ] each , and assigning them alternately to even and odd indexed cells , interference is totally avoided .",

    "the high - snr characterization of @xmath93 is given by @xmath94 where the deleterious effects of both the erasures , and the bandwidth sharing are clearly observed in the multiplexing gain expression .",
    "comparing the multiplexing gains of the scp and inter - cell frequency sharing ( icfs ) rates , reveals the superiority of the latter for erasure rates @xmath95 in the high - snr regime .      with mcp ,",
    "the bss send their received signals to a central processor ( cp ) via an ideal backhaul network .",
    "the cp collects the received signals and jointly decodes the mts messages .",

    "it is noted that , by the symmetry of the model , the ergodic per - cell sum - capacity derived above is also the equal per - cell capacity .    comparing the rate expression of the two - tap input - erasure channel with i.i.d .",

    "[ corr : mcp corr ] the per - cell sum - rate supported by the soft - handoff model with optimal joint decoding and no mt cooperation equals the rate of the two - tap input - erasure gaussian channel with i.i.d . inputs and @xmath99 .",
    "since the shoft - handoff model is equivalent in terms of its per - cell sum - rate to the input - erasure channel , all the results and conclusions reported in section [ sec : iegc rate analysis ] also hold here .",
    "in particular the high - snr characterization reduces to @xmath100 the benefits of mcp are evident in the high - snr regime since its rate has two - fold degrees of freedom relative to the icfs rate , and @xmath101-fold degrees of freedom relative to the scp rate .",

    "it is also worth mentioning that a similar analysis in @xcite facilitates also to address the issue of successful transmission per a given user , and when the average rate per user is examined , the results are in agreement with prop .",

    "it is also observed that icfs is beneficial over scp for erasure rates smaller than a certain threshold .",
    "a different scenario which gives rise to a similar , but _ non - ergodic _ , erasure model in a cellular scenario is one in which the mts may be active or not in a given block with a given probability accounting for dynamic user activity . according to this model , each user is randomly selected to be active with probability @xmath108 throughout the entire transmission block .",

    "also we can observe that both mcp and icfs are robust and maintain their throughput constant ( for icfs ) or almost constant ( for mcp ) regardless of @xmath52 , while the throughput of scp drops sharply with decreasing @xmath52 .",
    "this is easily explained since neither mcp nor icfs suffers from inter - cell interference , the first due to the fact that it leverages all received signals as useful , while the second since it avoids interference by frequency planning . on the other hand",

    "<S> this paper considers the input - erasure gaussian channel . in contrast to the output - erasure channel where </S>",
    "<S> erasures are applied to the output of a linear time - invariant ( lti ) system , here erasures , known to the receiver , are applied to the inputs of the lti system . focusing on the case where the input symbols are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d ) . </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that the two channels ( input- and output - erasure ) are equivalent . furthermore , assuming that the lti system consists of a two - tap finite impulse response ( fir ) filter , and using simple properties of tri - diagonal matrices , an achievable rate expression is presented in the form of an infinite sum . </S>",
    "<S> the results are then used to study the benefits of joint multicell processing ( mcp ) over single - cell processing ( scp ) in a simple linear cellular uplink , where each mobile terminal is received by only the two nearby base - stations ( bss ) . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the analysis accounts for ergodic shadowing that simultaneously blocks the mobile terminal ( mt ) signal from being received by the two bs . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the resulting ergodic per - cell capacity with optimal mcp is equivalent to that of the two - tap input - erasure channel . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the same cellular uplink is addressed by accounting for dynamic user activity , which is modelled by assuming that each mt is randomly selected to be active or to remain silent throughout the whole transmission block . for this alternative model , a similar equivalence results to the input - erasure channel are reported . </S>"
