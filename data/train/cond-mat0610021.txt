    "nonequilibrium steady states , on the other hand , are well known to be characterized by large fluctuations , and among the simplest measures of fluctuations are temporal and spatial correlations .    in this paper",

    "these models were introduced in @xcite as stochastic idealizations of certain mechanical models @xcite .",
    "our study is based on a combination of analytic arguments and numerical simulations .",
    "we believe random halves models are excellent candidates for this method of investigation for two reasons .",
    "first , their dynamics are richer and more complex than rigorously - understood models such as the simple exclusion @xcite and kmp models @xcite , as random halves models have two transported quantities ( energy and matter ) and highly nonlinear interactions involving two different time scales .",
    "these features make a purely analytical study more difficult .",

    "this is seldom the case in more realistic physical models .",

    "our numerical results are consistent with exact analytic results on the simple exclusion and kmp models  @xcite .",
    "we extend the existing picture to a setting of coupled energy and matter transport , with features not present in these two previously studied models .",

    "there is a second transported quantity , namely matter in the form of particles , and energy covariances are shown to be inversely related to local particle density . throughout the paper , we provide cross - checking numerical evidence for the phenomena we identify , and venture to give a physical interpretation whenever we can .",

    "the function @xmath18 is continuous but not differentiable at @xmath19 ; it has opposite concavity on the two sides of @xmath17 if the temperature profile @xmath416 is nonlinear .    that the curvature changes sign at @xmath17 is clearly visible in fig .",

    "via a series of theoretical arguments and numerical simulations , we have developed a coherent picture for the spatial covariances at steady state of the 1-d random halves model .",
    "we have established firmly that stored - energy covariances have order of magnitude @xmath418 away from the boundaries of @xmath4-chains .",
    "this in itself points to the presence of long - range covariances which decay very slowly .",
    "subsequent analysis shows that covariances decay _ linearly _ with macroscopic distance . for sites separated by microscopic distances",
    ", we have a simple formula that encapsulates the main ingredients on which energy covariances depend , including ( i ) a quadratic response to local temperature gradient , ( ii ) diffusive nature of the randomizing effect of the heat baths , and ( iii ) stabilizing effects of large numbers of tracers .",
    "since the random halves models are stochastic idealizations of certain mechanical models , we hope our results will also shed light on these and similar hamiltonian systems .",
    "there are , however , important differences , such as mixing and memory issues ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the extent to which the picture established here carries over to the hamiltonian setting remains to be seen .",
    "finally , it is well known that nonequilibrium phenomena are quite different in higher dimensions .",
    "our detailed study here provides a baseline for explorations in 2-d and 3-d , a project currently being carried out by the authors .",

    "[ sec : ey - desc ] ; expectation values with respect to the invariant measures are computed via time averages over long trajectories .",
    "the numerical issues are quite similar to those of markov chain monte carlo computations .",
    "we calculate empirical error bars using a standard `` batch means '' estimator .",
    "these error bars measure only statistical errors that arise from the fact that expectation values are estimated by time - averaging over finite intervals of time , _",
    "i.e. _ finite - length trajectories .",
    "the error bars do not account for _ finite - size effects _ , _",
    "i.e. _ bias due to the fact that we can only simulate @xmath4-chains with finite @xmath4 . to improve clarity and readability ,",
    "we have suppressed the error bars in most of the figures , displaying only those that are directly relevant to the issues being discussed .    a variety of variance reduction techniques have been invented to speed up the convergence of monte carlo calculations , ranging from multigrid monte carlo @xcite to large deviations - based importance sampling @xcite .",
    "most of these techniques require additional information , such as an explicit expression for the invariant measure or a large deviations functional .",
    "such methods do not work in our setting .",
    "there is on - going work on a class of algorithms which do not require detailed knowledge of the invariant measure @xcite .",
    "however , it is not known whether such techniques can be applied to the random halves model .",
    "the quantities of interest in most of our simulations are the @xmath419 . in general , these are relatively small numbers that are differences of two much larger numbers and can be rather costly to compute .",
    "we estimate the cost of computing @xmath420 as follows : for temperatures which are @xmath421 , both @xmath422 and @xmath423 are @xmath424 , while @xmath425 , where @xmath426 is the typical tracer density per site .",
    "( for the present discussion , we focus on @xmath137 away from the boundaries so that @xmath427 . ) in order to compute @xmath2 with a relative error of @xmath428 , we need @xmath429 with a relative error of @xmath430 ; the same is true for @xmath423 .",
    "since the statistical error in the time average @xmath431 is @xmath432 for some @xmath433 , this means we need to integrate the system for a time @xmath294 which is proportional to @xmath434 .",
    "now , the computational cost of simulating the system up to time @xmath294 , as measured by the total number of `` events , '' is proportional to the number of tracers @xmath435 in the system and the mean rate of activity of each tracer ( which is @xmath436 ) .",
    "thus , we have @xmath437 for our simulations involving long chains , we have found @xmath433 to be typically @xmath438 . as an example , for @xmath439 , @xmath440 , @xmath441 , @xmath442 , @xmath443 , we have @xmath444 , and @xmath445 , so that @xmath446 events are needed . on our computer system",

    "[ exp4 ] , [ exp6 ] , and [ exp9 ] , where we study the small-@xmath207 behavior of the covariance function , this rapid growth prevents us from taking @xmath207 too small .",
    "however , we do not always need small @xmath448 , and a large temperature gradient not only reduces the computational cost , it also takes the system farther out of equilibrium so that some effects are made more transparent .",
    "the cost also grows rapidly as @xmath4 increases .",
    "this is why we use short chains wherever possible , for example in computing the @xmath246-curve . in simulation  [ exp5 ] , we use @xmath449 because we feel that the amount of accuracy gained from using longer chains is perhaps not worth the additional cost .",
    "however , it is not always possible or advisable to use short chains , particularly where infinite - volume limits are involved . in such cases",

    "the number @xmath461 is defined analogously with site @xmath471 playing the role of site @xmath468 .    to prove the invariance of @xmath472 , three sets of balancing conditions have to be met .",
