    "the large area telescope aboard _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ ( @xcite ) has proved remarkably successful at discovering rotation - powered pulsars emitting photons above 0.1  gev .",
    "thanks to its superb sensitivity , the number of gamma - ray pulsars has increased from six in compton gamma ray observatory era ( @xcite ) to more than one hundred ( @xcite ) . plotting their best estimate of the gamma - ray luminosity , @xmath0 , against the spin - down luminosity , @xmath1",
    ", @xcite found the important relation that @xmath0 is approximately proportional to @xmath2 ( with a large scatter ) , where @xmath3 refers to the neutron - star ( ns ) moment of inertia , @xmath4 the ns rotational period , and @xmath5 its temporal derivative .",
    "however , it is unclear why this relationship arises , in spite of its potential importance to discriminate pulsar emission models such as the polar - cap model ( @xcite ) , the outer - gap model ( @xcite ) , the pair - starved polar - cap model ( @xcite ) ( see also @xcite for the possible co - existence of such models ) , and the emission model from the wind zone ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent gamma - ray observations suggest that the pulsed gamma - rays are emitted from the higher altitudes of a pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "this is because the observed light curves ( @xcite ) favor fan - like emission geometry , which scan over a large fraction of the celestial sphere , and because the crab pulsar shows pulsed photons near and above 100  gev ( @xcite ) , which rules out an emission from the lower altitudes , where strong magnetic absorption takes place for @xmath6-rays above @xmath7  gev .",
    "consequently , higher - altitude emission models such as the outer - gap model ( @xcite ) , the high - altitude slot - gap model ( @xcite ) , or the pair - starved polar - cap model ( @xcite ) , gathered attention .",
    "it is noteworthy that the outer - gap model is presently the only higher - altitude emission model that is solvable from the basic equations self - consistently ( @xcite ) . in the present paper , therefore , we focus on the outer - gap model and derive the observed relationship @xmath8 both analytically and numerically .",
    "we schematically depict the pulsar outer - magnetospheric accelerator ( i.e. , the outer gap ) in figure  1 of @xcite as the ns rotates , there appears the light cylinder , within which plasmas can co - rotate with the magnetosphere .",
    "the magnetic field lines that become tangential to the light cylinder at the light cylinder radius , @xmath9 , are called the last - open magnetic field lines , where @xmath10 refers to the speed of light .",
    "pairs are produced via photon - photon pair production mostly near the null - charge surface and quickly polarized by the magnetic - field - aligned electric field , @xmath11 , in the gap . in this paper , we assume that the rotation and magnetic axes reside in the same hemisphere to obtain @xmath12 , which accelerates positrons ( @xmath13 s ) outwards while electrons ( @xmath14 s ) inwards .",
    "these ultra - relativistic particles have lorentz factors , @xmath15 , to emit photons efficiently by the curvature process .",
    "in this section , we analytically derive how the gamma - ray luminosity of an outer gap evolves with time . in the outer magnetosphere ,",
    "only the dipole component remains in the magnetic field ; thus , the inhomogeneous part of the maxwell equation ( i.e. , the poisson equation for the electro - static potential ) gives the magnetic - field - aligned electric field @xcite , @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the ns magnetic dipole moment , and @xmath18 the trans - magnetic - field thickness of the gap .",
    "since the poisson equation is a second - order differential equation , @xmath11 is proportional to @xmath19 .",
    "electrons ( @xmath14 s ) and positrons ( @xmath13 s ) are created via photon - photon ( and sometimes via magnetic ) pair production , being subsequently polarized by @xmath11 and accelerated in the opposite directions , to finally attain the terminal lorentz factor @xmath20 where @xmath21 refers to the radius of curvature of particle s motion in the three - dimensional magnetosphere , @xmath22 the charge on the positron .",
    "photons are radiated by such ultra - relativistic @xmath23 s via curvature process with characteristic energy , @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the planck constant , @xmath26 . once @xmath18 is obtained",
    ", we can readily compute the @xmath6-ray luminosity of curvature radiation from an outer gap by @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 , which has been conventionally assumed to be approximately unity , refers to the flux correction factor @xcite , and @xmath29 the rotation angular frequency of the ns . here",
    ", it is assumed that the current density flowing in the gap is comparable to the goldreich - julain value @xcite .",
    "the last factor , @xmath30 is proportional to the spin - down luminosity , @xmath31 . therefore , the evolution law , @xmath32 , is crucially governed by the evolution of @xmath18 as a function of the ns age , @xmath33 .    the evolution of @xmath18 is essentially controlled by the photon - photon pair production in the pulsar magnetosphere . to analytically examine the pair production , we assume the static dipole magnetic field configuration for simplicity , and consider the plane on which both the rotational and magnetic axes reside . on this two - dimensional latitudinal plane",
    ", the last - open field line intersects the ns surface at magnetic co - latitudinal angle @xmath34 ( measured from the magnetic dipole axis ) that satisfies @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the ns radius , @xmath37 the angle ( measured from the rotation axis ) of the point where the last - open field line becomes tangential to the light cylinder , and @xmath38 the inclination angle of the dipole magnetic axis with respect to the rotation axis .",
    "a magnetic field line can be specified by the magnetic co - latitude ( measured from the dipole axis ) , @xmath39 , where it intersects the stellar surface .",
    "a magnetic field line does not close within the light cylinder ( i.e. , open to large distances ) if @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the last - open field lines , @xmath41 , corresponds to the _ lower _ boundary , which forms a surface in a three - dimensional magnetosphere , of the outer gap .",
    "let us assume that the gap _ upper _ boundary coincides with the magnetic field lines that are specified by @xmath42 .",
    "numerical examinations show that @xmath18 , indeed , changes as a function of the distance along the field line and the magnetic azimuthal angle ( measured counter - clockwise around the dipole axis ) .",
    "nevertheless , except for young pulsars like the crab pulsar , an assumption of a spatially constant @xmath18 gives a relatively good estimate .",
    "thus , for an analytical purpose , we adopt a constant @xmath18 in this analytical examination . in this case , we can specify the middle - latitude field line by the magnetic co - latitude @xmath43 .",
    "screening of @xmath11 due to the polarization of the produced pairs , takes place mostly in the lower altitudes .",
    "it is , therefore , appropriate to evaluate the screening of @xmath11 around the point ( @xmath44,@xmath45 ) where the null - charge surface intersects the middle - latitude field line .",
    "an inwardly migrating electron ( or an outwardly migrating positron ) emits photons inwards ( or outwards ) , which propagate the typical distance @xmath46 ( or @xmath47 ) before escaping from the gap . denoting the cross section of the inward ( or outward ) horizontal line from the point ( @xmath44,@xmath45 ) and the upper boundary as ( @xmath48,@xmath49 ) ( or as ( @xmath50,@xmath51 ) ) , and noting @xmath52",
    ", we obtain @xmath53 @xmath54 along the upper - boundary field line , we obtain @xmath55 }           { r_\\ast},\\ ] ] whereas along the middle - latitude field line , we obtain @xmath56 }           { r_\\ast}.\\ ] ] combining these two equations , and noting @xmath57 , we find that @xmath49 ( @xmath58 ) and @xmath51 ( @xmath59 ) can be given by the solution @xmath60 that satisfies @xmath61 where @xmath45 is given by @xmath62 thus , if we specify @xmath38 , we can solve @xmath63 and @xmath64 as a function of @xmath18 by equation  ( [ eq : s_th1 ] ) . substituting these @xmath49 and @xmath51 into equations  ( [ eq : s_l1 ] ) and ( [ eq : s_l2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where @xmath44 depends on @xmath4 .    if @xmath65 , we can expand the left - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : s_th1 ] ) around @xmath66 , where @xmath63 for inward ( or @xmath64 for outward ) @xmath6-rays to find @xmath67 .",
    "that is , the leading terms in the expansion vanish and we obtain @xmath68 from the next - order terms , which are quadratic to @xmath69 . assuming @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is appropriate for @xmath72 years for a light - element - envelope ns and for @xmath73 years for a heavy - element ns , we find @xmath74 , and hence @xmath75 . since the dipole radiation formula gives @xmath76 , we obtain @xmath77 .",
    "thus , when the gap is very thin , which is expected for a light - element - envelope ns , @xmath0 little evolves with the pulsar age , @xmath33 .",
    "however , if @xmath78 , say , the rapidly expanding magnetic flux tube gives asymmetric solution , @xmath79 .",
    "that is , the third and higher order terms in the expansion contribute significantly compared to the quadratic terms .",
    "thus , we must solve equation  ( [ eq : s_th1 ] ) for @xmath60 ( @xmath80 or @xmath51 ) without assuming @xmath81 , in general .",
    "let us now consider the condition for a gap to be self - sustained . a single ingoing @xmath14 or an outgoing @xmath13 emits @xmath82 or @xmath83 photons while running the typical distance @xmath46 or @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "such photons materialize as pairs with probability @xmath84 or @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 denote the x - ray flux inside and outside of ( @xmath44,@xmath45 ) , respectively ; @xmath88 and @xmath88 are the pair - production cross section for inward and outward photons , respectively .",
    "thus , a single @xmath14 or @xmath13 cascades into @xmath89 pairs or into @xmath90 pairs within the gap .",
    "that is , a single inward - migrating @xmath14 cascades into pairs with multiplicity @xmath91 .",
    "such produced pairs are polarized by @xmath11 .",
    "each returning , outward - migrating @xmath13 cascades into pairs with multiplicity @xmath92 in outer magnetosphere . as a result , a single inward @xmath14 cascades eventually into @xmath93 inward @xmath14 s , which should become unity for the gap to be self - sustained . therefore , in a stationary gap , the gap thickness @xmath18 is automatically regulated so that the gap closure condition , @xmath94 may be satisfied .    approximately speaking , a single , inward - migrating @xmath14 emits @xmath95 curvature photons , a portion of which head - on collide the surface x - ray photons to materialize as pairs with probability @xmath96 within the gap .",
    "thus , a single @xmath14 cascades into @xmath97 pairs in the gap .",
    "each produced @xmath13 return outwards to emit @xmath98 photons , which materialize as pairs with probability @xmath99 by tail - on colliding with the surface x - rays .",
    "in another word , @xmath100 holds regardless of the nature of the pair production process ( e.g. , either photon - photon or magnetic process @xcite ) in the lower altitudes , because it is determined by the pair - production efficiency in the outer magnetosphere @xmath101 , which is always due to photon - photon pair production .",
    "in general , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 are expressed in terms of @xmath18 , @xmath4 , @xmath17 , @xmath106 , and @xmath38 , where @xmath106 denotes the ns surface temperature .",
    "note that we can solve @xmath107 as a function of the ns age , @xmath33 , from the spin - down law .",
    "thus , specifying @xmath38 and the cooling curve , @xmath108 , we can solve @xmath18 as a function of @xmath33 from the gap closure condition , @xmath109 .",
    "note also that the spin - down law readily gives the spin - down luminosity , @xmath110 , as a function of @xmath33 , once @xmath111 is solved . on these grounds ,",
    "@xmath0 can be related to @xmath31 with an intermediate parameter @xmath33 , if we specify the cooling curve and the spin - down law .",
    "substituting equations  ( [ eq : s_n1 ] ) and ( [ eq : s_n2 ] ) into ( [ eq : s_stationary ] ) , we obtain @xmath112 where @xmath113 with @xmath114 ; @xmath115 denotes the @xmath6-ray frequency , and @xmath116 the planck function .",
    "we have to integrate over the soft photon frequency @xmath117 above the threshold energy @xmath118 where @xmath119 refers to the rest - mass energy of the electron .",
    "the cosine of the collision angle @xmath120 becomes @xmath121 for outward ( or @xmath122 for inward ) @xmath6-rays .",
    "that is , collisions take place head - on ( or tail - on ) for inward ( or outward ) @xmath6-rays .",
    "the total cross section is given by @xmath123,\\ ] ] where @xmath124 denotes the thomson cross section and @xmath125    pair production takes place when the @xmath6-rays collide with the surface x - rays in the wien regime , that is , at @xmath126 .",
    "an accurate evaluation of @xmath127 requires a careful treatment of the collision geometry , because the threshold energy , @xmath128 , strongly depends on the tiny collision angles . in the numerical method ( next section ) , the pair - production absorption coefficient is explicitly computed at each point in the three - dimensional pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "however , in this section , for analytical purpose , we simply adopt the empirical relation , @xmath129 where @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 for @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 , respectively ; @xmath136 .",
    "the x - ray flux is evaluated at ( @xmath44,@xmath45 ) such that @xmath137 where @xmath138 refers to the luminosity of photon radiation from the the cooling ns surface . for a smaller @xmath38 , the point ( @xmath50,@xmath51 ) is located in the higher altitudes , where the magnetic field lines begin to collimate along the rotation axis , deviating from the static dipole configuration .",
    "thus , the collision angles near the light cylinder , and hence @xmath127 decreases with decreasing @xmath38 .",
    "the explicit value of @xmath139 can be computed only numerically , solving the photon specific intensity from infrared to @xmath6-ray energies in the three - dimensional pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "the last factor , @xmath140 , in the left - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : s_master ] ) is given by @xmath141 thus , equation  ( [ eq : s_master ] ) gives @xmath142 where the @xmath44 dependence vanishes .",
    "substituting equations  ( [ eq : app_ell ] ) , ( [ eq : app_lf ] ) , ( [ eq : app_eg ] ) into ( [ eq : s_master2 ] ) , we can solve @xmath18 as a function of @xmath143 , @xmath4 , and @xmath17 .    to describe the evolution of @xmath144 ,",
    "we adopt in this paper @xmath145 where @xmath146 for a magnetic dipole braking , while @xmath147 for a force - free braking @xcite . assuming a magnetic dipole braking , we obtain @xmath148 where @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "thus , if we specify a cooling scenario , @xmath108 , equation  ( [ eq : s_master2 ] ) gives @xmath18 as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "note that the @xmath38 dependence of the spin - down law is not essential for the present purpose ; thus , @xmath151 is simply adopted .",
    "once @xmath152 is obtained , equation  ( [ eq : lg_0 ] ) readily gives @xmath0 as a function of @xmath33 , and hence of @xmath31 .",
    "it is worth noting that the heated polar - cap emission is relatively weak compared to the cooling ns emission , except for millisecond or middle - aged pulsars .",
    "we adopt the minimal cooling scenario @xcite within the minimal cooling scenario , the cooling history of a ns substantially depends on the composition of the envelope .",
    "we adopt the cooling curves given in @xcite and consider the two extreme cases : light element and heavy element envelopes .",
    "we present the solved @xmath18 for a light and a heavy element envelope in figure  2 in @xcite .",
    "it follows that the gap becomes thinner for a light element case than for the heavy element cases .",
    "this is because the more luminous photon field of a light element envelope leads to a copious pair production , which prevents the gap to expand in the trans - field direction . as a result",
    ", the predicted @xmath0 becomes less luminous for a light element envelope than a heavy one .    in figure",
    "[ fig : lglsp_2 ] , we present the analytical results of @xmath0 versus @xmath31 as the dotted ( or dashed ) curve for a light ( or a heavy ) element envelope .",
    "as the pulsar spins down , @xmath0 evolves leftwards .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath0 little evolves for a light element envelope , as explained in @xcite .",
    "let us develop the analytical examination and look deeper into a self - consistent solution by a numerical method . to this end",
    ", we adopt the modern outer - gap model @xcite and solve the set of maxwell and boltzmann equations self - consistently and compute @xmath11 , distribution functions of @xmath23 s , and the photon specific intensity at each point in the three - dimensional pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "we consider not only the whole - surface , cooling ns emission but also the heated polar - cap emission as the photon source of photon - photon pair production in the numerical analysis .",
    "the former emission component is given as a function of the pulsar age from the minimum cooling scenario , in the same manner as in the analytical examination , while the latter emission component is solved consistently with the energy flux of the @xmath14 s falling on to the pulsar polar - cap surface .",
    "the numerical method is described in @xcite in detail .",
    "we solve the set of partial and ordinary differential equations under the boundary conditions that @xmath23 s or @xmath6-rays do not penetrate into the gap from outside . by this method",
    ", we can solve the acceleration electric field @xmath11 , particle distribution functions @xmath153 , and the photon specific intensity @xmath154 ( from @xmath155  ev to @xmath156  tev ) , at each position in the three - dimensional magnetosphere of arbitrary rotation - powered pulsars , if we specify @xmath4 , @xmath17 , @xmath38 , and @xmath157 .",
    "we adopt the minimum cooling scenario in the same manner as in   [ sec : analytical ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : lglsp_2 ] , we plot the result of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath31 as the dash - dotted ( or solid ) curve for a light ( or a heavy ) element envelope , where @xmath158 is adopted in the same manner as in the analytical examination .",
    "it follows that these numerical solutions are consistent with the analytical ones , and that @xmath0 decreases slowly until @xmath159 years .",
    "the physical reason why @xmath0 increases with decreasing @xmath31 at @xmath160  years for a light element envelope , is the same as described at the end of ",
    "[ sec : analytical ] .",
    "a realistic ns will have an envelope composition between the two extreme cases , light and heavy elements .",
    "thus , the actual @xmath0 s will distribute between the red solid ( or dashed ) and the blue dash - dotted ( or dotted ) curves .",
    "however , after @xmath0 approaches @xmath31 ( thin dashed straight line ; see @xcite for the death line argument ) , the outer gap survives only along the limited magnetic field lines in the trailing side of the rotating magnetosphere because of a less efficient pair production ; as a result , @xmath0 rapidly decreases with decreasing @xmath31 . for a smaller @xmath38 , even for a light element envelope ,",
    "@xmath0 monotonically decreases as the dash - dot - dot - dot curve shows , because the gap is located in the higher altitudes , and because the less efficient pair production there prevents the produced electric current to increase with decreasing age around @xmath161  years .",
    "to sum up , a light element envelope approximately corresponds to the lower bound of the ( observationally inferred ) gamma - ray luminosity of rotation - powered pulsars , whereas a heavy element one to the upper bound .",
    "the scatter of the intrinsic gamma - ray luminosity is physically determined by the magnetic inclination angle , @xmath38 , and the envelope composition .",
    "the cutoff energy of the primary curvature emission is kept below several gev even for young pulsars , because the gap trans - field thickness , and hence the acceleration electric field , is suppressed by the polarization of the produced pairs in the lower altitudes .    to convert the observed @xmath6-ray flux into luminosity , @xmath0 ,",
    "one has conventionally assumed @xmath162 .",
    "for example , the error bars of the observational data points in figure  [ fig : lglsp_2 ] , do not contain any uncertainties incurred by @xmath28 .",
    "nevertheless , if @xmath38 and @xmath163 can be constrained , we can estimate @xmath0 more accurately , by applying the present quantitative outer - gap calculations .",
    "it is noteworthy that @xmath0 s given in figure  [ fig : lglsp_2 ] little depend on the ns magnetic moment , @xmath17 .",
    "this is particularly true for a light element case , which has @xmath65 , by the reason described after equation  ( [ eq : s_th0 ] ) .",
    "what is more , with an additional determination of @xmath164 ( e.g. , by parallax observations ) , we can infer the composition of individual ns envelopes , by using the constrained flux correction factor , @xmath28 ( fig .  6 in @xcite ) .",
    "we hope to address such a question as the determination of @xmath38 and @xmath163 , and hence @xmath28 , for individual pulsars , by making an atlas of the pulse profiles and phase - resolved spectra that are solved from the basic equations in a wide parameter space of @xmath4 , @xmath17 , @xmath106 , @xmath38 , and @xmath163 , and by comparing the atlas with the observations .",
