    "observation of the early universe through neutrino messengers of the highest possible energies requires a detector of enormous instrumented volume  @xcite . at the same time ,",
    "lepton flavor identification of such radio detection events represents a completely unique tool for the study of cosmological evolution of the universe .",
    "particle interactions at extreme energies provide a probe capable of illuminating the completely unknown acceleration mechanisms of the highest energy cosmic ray events  @xcite .",
    "particle identification is also crucial to the physics program of a next generation `` super '' b factory .",
    "such an accelerator will produce b mesons in sufficiently copious quantities to permit detailed scrutiny of standard model predictions in the flavor sector  @xcite .",
    "any new theories for physics beyond the standard model must leave fingerprints that can be detected via flavor transformation of particles in the final state . therefore , particle identification is essential and the detector and readout electronics must survive the very high signal occupancies expected  @xcite .",
    "we present results from a deep - sampling asic that meets these requirements , based upon extension of the successful labrador asic  @xcite .",
    "the blab1 asic is a single channel , multi - gsa / s waveform sampler with a record depth of @xmath0 analog storage samples .",
    "the blab1 analog input is ac coupled with an external capacitor and 50 @xmath1 terminated with an on - chip terminator , as should be expected for a high - performance rf device .",
    "after the on - chip terminator , an analog buffer tree fans out copies of the signal to the matrix of 128 rows of 512 samples composing the 64k array .",
    "each of the rows may be independently addressed to initiate a storage cycle . within each switched capacitor array",
    "( sca ) storage cell is a capacitor and a comparator . a block diagram of the blab1 readout is shown in fig .  [ block ] .",
    "when an analog switch is pulsed closed , the instantaneous input signal is stored on a 14 ff capacitor .",
    "the charge is then held until either overwritten or discharged due to leakage current .",
    "each sampling capacitor is connected to the negative input of a comparator .",
    "the positive input of each comparator is connected to a common voltage ramp .",
    "a wire - bonded blab1 die photograph is shown in fig .",
    "[ bond ] , with this storage array contained within about 5.25 square mm of the die shown .",
    "m process.,width=272 ]    conversion of these stored samples is via a wilkinson adc method , where the stored voltage is converted into a transition time of the in - cell comparator due to an applied voltage ramp .",
    "this ramp is generated with a current mirror and can be adjusted both by varying the ramping current , as well as an external capacitor .",
    "the typical ramping current range is 10 - 100@xmath2a and the ramp capacitor size is a few hundred @xmath3 .",
    "encoding is performed by measuring the time interval between the ramp start and the comparator output transition . in a simple form of time - to - digital conversion",
    ", this interval is measured by counting the number of high - speed clock cycles taken . in the predecessor asic @xcite ,",
    "the gray code counter was implemented on - chip , whereas in blab1 it is implemented inside a companion programmable logic device , in this case a field programmable gate array ( fpga ) .",
    "when the voltage ramp is started , a gray code counter in the fpga is enabled coincident to a high speed clock ( 500mhz ) and the comparator output is used to latch the counter value . by knowing the ramping voltage slope and the high speed clock frequency , the latched counter value can be converted into voltage .",
    "a group of 32 comparators are selected , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ array_scheme ] , and are read out during each ramping cycle .        by addressing a row and selecting a group of 32 columns for each conversion cycle ,",
    "the window of interest inside the asic is read out .",
    "importantly , this readout operation can be done while sampling continues , providing continuous pipelining and subsequent deadtime reduction .",
    "this decision to move the high - speed clock and registers off - chip also means that the size of each storage cell can be significantly reduced .",
    "a schematic of the base blab1 storage cell is shown in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] , where the comparator is simply a differential nmos pair .",
    "the corresponding layout is shown in fig .  [ pix_cell ] , where the overall dimensions are @xmath4 by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 m .",
    "this corresponds to 4.8@xmath7 m by 16.68@xmath2 m , or about 80@xmath8 required per storage cell .        , which is @xmath9m.,height=355 ]    therefore the core of the sampling array requires only 5.25@xmath10 of chip area , permitting more than an order of magnitude improvement in storage density compared with existing devices  @xcite .",
    "reducing the cell size and subsequently the storage capacitance also helps improve the bandwidth that can be coupled into each storage cell .",
    "since the `` on '' resistance of the switch is relatively high ( @xmath11 ) , frequencies above    @xmath12    will roll off for a given pixel capacitance @xmath13 . the extracted capacitance value for the layout in fig .",
    "[ pix_cell ] is approximately 14 ff .",
    "therefore the expected @xmath14 from the common input bus line into each storage cell is approximately 2.3 ghz .",
    "we note that the size of the storage cell can be reduced further by removing individual sample delay timing chains from each storage row . as seen in the bottom of fig .",
    "[ pix_cell ] , this inverter pair is more than half the area of the storage cell . for power dissipation reasons ,",
    "this removal turns out to be important , as will be discussed later .",
    "a further benefit of decoupling the latching register and clocking functionality is that the conversion clock can be run at a much higher speed inside the fpga , since it is routinely fabricated in either a 65 nm or 90 nm process , compared with the relatively coarse 250 nm ( 0.25@xmath2 m ) process of blab1 .",
    "typically with the chosen xilinx virtex family employed we are able to use a 500mhz clock , and record the phase of the clock as well , thereby effectively having a 1ns least count .",
    "separate testing indicates that this tdc performs very close to the ideal binary interpolation @xmath15 limit ( @xmath16ps ) , as reported previously  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the number of bits of resolution or precision can be completely configurable , which permits a trade - off of the readout latency versus required sample resolution for various applications .",
    "we note in passing that there is a potentially much better method based upon applying this same waveform sampling technique to the timing encoding of the comparator output .",
    "the tdc least count would then become 1ns @xmath17ps , and fitting the output shape , better than binary encoding time resolution may be possible .",
    "while the coupling into individual storage cells can support high analog bandwidth ( @xmath18ghz ) , the cumulative capacitance seen when trying to drive the array of 64k cells is very problematic .",
    "the extracted capacitance of each of the @xmath0 switch drains is about 1.5ff , which sums to a total array capacitance @xmath19 of 98pf .",
    "clearly , for a reasonably low input coupling impedance of @xmath20 , this bandwidth limitation to    @xmath21    would be completely unacceptable . therefore a 3-level buffer tree has been employed , to reduce the loading seen at each stage of signal fan - out .",
    "the unity gain for zero capacitance of these buffer amplifiers is in excess of 1ghz .",
    "in retrospect , the choice of fanout : @xmath22 was not optimal , as the capacitance of the intermediate state was rather high and limits the performance , as will be shown in the testing section .",
    "the sampling speed is controlled by adjusting the vdd / vss supply voltages of one of the two inverter - inverter delay stages between each adjacent sampling cell in a particular sampling row .    as mentioned early , by addressing a row and pulsing the first cell of that particular row , a write strobe then propagates along the row until it reaches the last cell in the row .",
    "the leading edge of the pulse closes the switch and the trailing edge opens the switch , at which point the analog voltage value is stored .    upon the determination of an external trigger condition , further sampling to the row(s ) or interest are blocked in firmware and a ramping voltage is generated by using a constant current source and reference capacitor , as mentioned earlier .",
    "the ramping voltage for the blab1 can be generated using either an external capacitor or an on - chip capacitor .",
    "a external capacitor is necessary for slower ramping speeds .",
    "the current source is set by an external resistor .",
    "a unique feature of the blab1 s digitization technique is that the adc resolution does not have a default value . for a fixed clock frequency ,",
    "reducing the ramping voltage speed will increase adc resolution .",
    "however , by using a slower ramp , it will take longer to digitize .",
    "blab1 was designed to be a low power adc .",
    "three voltage sources are required to operate the blab1 .",
    "a voltage source of 2.5 volts is the main power source .",
    "an adjustable vdd source is used to control the sampling speed .",
    "a pedestal voltage , typically 1.3 volts , is used to set the dc offset of the rf input .",
    "when in quiescent mode , the power draw can be 10mw or less .",
