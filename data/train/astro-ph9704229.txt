    "cygnus  x-2 ( discovered by bowyer et al . 1965 ) is a very well studied bright low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) .",
    "hasinger & van der klis ( 1989 ) classified the brightest lmxbs into two sub - classes , i.e. the `` z '' sources and the `` atoll '' sources , on the basis of their correlated x - ray spectral and fast timing behaviour .",
    "cygnus  x-2 was classified as a z source . in the x - ray colour - colour diagram ( cd )",
    "z sources trace out a z shaped track and move smoothly , without jumps , through the branches . in all the six",
    "known z sources , except gx 349 + 2 , three branches have been identified , the horizontal branch ( hb ) , the normal branch ( nb ) and the flaring branch ( fb ) . the transition between the hb and the nb is called the hard vertex , and between the nb and the fb the soft vertex .",
    "the variation of one single parameter , i.e. the mass transfer rate to the compact object ( ) , is thought to produce the tracks ( e.g. hasinger & van der klis 1989 , lamb 1991 ) .",
    "recent studies of exosat data of the z sources ( see kuulkers et al .",
    "1994a , 1996a , b ; kuulkers & van der klis 1996 ) indicate that the z sources can be divided into two groups , the cyg - like sources ( cyg  x-2 , gx  5 - 1 and gx  340 + 0 ) and the sco - like sources ( sco  x-1 , gx  349 + 2 and gx  17 + 2 ) .",
    "the cyg - like sources show motion of the z pattern in the colour - colour diagram and the hardness - intensity diagram ( hid ) , their hbs are horizontal , and when the sources are on their short fbs the x - ray intensity generally decreases .",
    "the sco - like sources , instead , do not display significant motion of their z pattern in the cd , their hbs are almost vertical , and the x - ray intensity increases when they move onto their extended fbs . it was proposed ( see kuulkers & van der klis 1995b , and references therein ) that the sco - like sources are viewed face - on ( low orbital inclination ) and the cyg - like sources more edge - on ( higher orbital inclination ) , and that the motion of the cyg - like sources could be caused by accreting material , such as a precessing accretion disk getting into the line of sight .",
    "theoretical studies ( psaltis et al . 1995 ) indicate that a difference of magnetic field strength can explain some of the differences between the cyg- and the sco - like sources . in their model ,",
    "the cyg - like sources have a somewhat higher magnetic field strength ( b @xmath1 gauss ) than the sco - like sources ( b @xmath2 gauss ) .",
    "their so - called unified model can explain the z tracks in the cds and hids and the difference in the z shapes between the cyg - like and sco - like sources .",
    "however , no explanation is given for the fact that the cyg - like sources display motion of the tracks , whereas the sco - like sources do not .",
    "cygnus  x-2 shows the most pronounced motion of the z pattern in the cd and the hid of all z sources .",
    "one of the first observations of z pattern motion in the hid was found by vrtilek et al .",
    "( 1986 ) using einstein mpc data .",
    "they observed a factor of two increase in intensity between different epochs but also an increase of the intensity on time scales less than a day . at that time the z track behaviour of cygnus  x-2 was not yet known , so they interpreted the variations as due to orbital effects .",
    "nowadays we know that most of the intensity variations of cygnus  x-2 are due to the non - periodic motion of the source through the z track , and most likely associated with changes in .",
    "however , not all intensity variations that were found by vrtilek et al .",
    "( 1986 ) can be explained in this manner . in their fig .  2",
    ", three branches are present which now can probably be identified as nbs .",
    "these branches are shifted with respect to each other , making this in retrospect the first indication that cygnus  x-2 displays motion of the z - track in the hid .",
    "clear evidence for z track motion in the cd and the hids was found when different exosat observations of   were compared with each other ( hasinger et al .",
    "1985b , hasinger 1987 , 1988 ) .",
    "hasinger ( 1987 ) discussed six exosat observations of cygnus  x-2 .",
    "he found that the z tracks of different observations were displaced in the hids with respect to each other .",
    "hasinger et al .",
    "( 1985b ) and hasinger ( 1988 ) reported a state of cygnus  x-2 with very low count rates .",
    "the count rates , especially in the high energy bands , flared and the spectrum was hard . in the cd",
    "this observation looked like a large fb , and it is displaced to harder colours with respect to other cygnus  x-2 exosat observations ( see also kuulkers et al .",

    "( 1988 ) investigated the long - term temporal variability of cygnus  x-2 using six different instruments on three satellites ( oso 8 , heao 1 , and einstein ) .",
    "three count rate states between 2 and 10 kev were found . during the lowest state the spectrum was harder than during the other two states .",
    "the motion of the z trough the cd and hid was again reported in early ginga observations of cygnus  x-2 reported by hasinger et al .",
    "they found that the z track in the hid during the october 1988 observation was shifted to higher intensities ( by a factor two ) with respect to the july 1988 observation . in the cd the z track of the october 1988 observation was shifted downward parallel to the nb with respect to the july 1988 observation .",
    "the shape of the z track in both the cd and the hid was different between these two observations . during the july 1988 observation",
    "the z track performed a loop in the hid at the nb - fb transition , such that along the fb the source first rose in intensity and later decreased . during the october 1988 observation",
    "no such loop was found .",
    "instead , along the fb the source immediately started to decrease in intensity . in the cd of the july 1988 observations the hb is diagonal and",
    "the fb is large . in the october 1988 cd",
    "the hb is horizontal and the fb is very small .",
    "kuulkers et al .",
    "( 1996a ) reanalysed all exosat observations of cygnus  x-2 .",
    "they also reported motion of the z pattern and different shapes of the z track .",
    "they compared their results with all previous reports on cygnus  x-2 , and described the phenomenolgy in terms of three different intensity levels ( possibly part of a continuous sequence ) . in the rare low level cygnus",
    "x-2 displays a hard spectrum at the lowest intensities .",
    "these episodes seemed to occur at binary phases 0.8 - 0.2 ( with phase 0.0 defined as the x - ray source superior conjunction ) , however not in each orbital cycle .",
    "vritlek et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and kuulkers et al .",
    "( 1996a ) discussed various possible explanations , e.g. that at these times the secondary hides its heated face and/or part of our view of the inner disk region , so that most of the observed radiation then comes from a scattering hot corona surrounding the inner accretion disk , or that a tilted disk or a hot spot at the outer disk hide much of the inner disk region from our view .",
    "the other two intensity levels were called the medium and the high level . a periodicity in the occurence of these intensity levels could not be found .",
    "the shape of the z track in the hids was dependent on these intensity levels .",
    "as the source moves onto the fb during high level episodes , the intensity immediately starts to decrease and the fb in the hid is almost horizontal .",
    "they called this a colour - independent dip . when the source moves up the fb during medium level episodes the intensity first increases and then decreases .",
    "the fb in the hid is also pointed upwards and therefore referred to as a colour - dependent dip .",
    "no z track was observed during the low level .",
    "the fast timing behaviour of z sources is closely related to the position of the sources in the cd and hid ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) . on all branches a very - low frequency noise ( vlfn ) and a high frequency noise ( hfn ) component in the power spectra",
    "can be identified . on the horizontal and normal branches also low frequency noise ( lfn )",
    "can be identified which decreases in amplitude from the hb to the upper normal branch and disappears on the lower normal branch .",
    "quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) are found on the horizontal branch ( called hbos ) with a frequency from @xmath412 hz at the left end of the hb up to @xmath455  hz near the hard vertex , and then remains constant upto halfway the normal branch .",

    "are observed with a frequency between 57 hz .",
    "sometimes the hbo is seen simultaneously with the nbo , indicating different mechanisms are responsible for these qpos . on the flaring branch",
    "sometimes a qpo ( fbo ) is seen with a frequency near 7 hz at the beginning of the fb , but rapidly increasing in frequency up to @xmath5 hz further up the fb .",
    "the 7 - 20 hz flaring branch qpo has not been found on .",
    "however , kuulkers & van der klis ( 1995a ) detected a qpo on the fb of cygnus  x-2 with a frequency of 26 hz .",

    "in cygnus  x-2 burst - like events have been reported ( kahn & grindlay 1984 ; kuulkers et al .",
    "kuulkers et al .",
    "( 1995 ) detected 9 burst - like events in the archival exosat data of cygnus  x-2 .",
    "these burst - like events had a short duration ( t@xmath63 s ) , did not show evidence for cooling , and did not occur in specific regions of the z track . to date it is unclear wether these burst - like events are genuine type i bursts . in this paper",
    "we present an uniform analysis of all available data obtained by the large area counter ( lac ) instrument on board the ginga satellite .",
    "cygnus  x-2 was observed with the ginga satellite ( makino and the astro - c team 1987 ) during 7 observations . for a log of the observations we refer to table [ obslog ] . due to earth occultations and the high background in the south atlantic anomaly ( saa )",
    "the observations were broken up into many pieces with a length of several tens of minutes .    the lac instrument ( turner et al . 1989 ) on board ginga was used in several different observation modes : the mpc1 , mpc2 , mpc3 and the pc mode . in the mpc1 and the mpc2 ( hereafter mpc1/2 ) modes the source",
    "was observed in 48 photon energy channels and the time resolution ranged from 62.5 ms to 16 s. in the mpc3 mode the source was observed in 12 channels with a best high time resolution of 7.8 ms . in the pc mode",
    "only four overlapping channels were used and the time resolution was 1 or 2 ms . by manipulating the coarse gain ( cg ) amplifier , which had two levels , the energy range could be set to either 0.537 kev ( low cg level ) or to 0.318.7 kev ( high cg level ) . by changing the high voltage ( hv ) levels the energy range could be extended to even higher energies ( e.g. up to 60 kev ) . due to these different cg amplifier settings , hv level settings and lower discriminator settings ( see turner et al .",

    "is of the order of a few precent ( hertz et al .",
    "due to , e.g. , a long period without attitude control measurements the offset angle sometimes increased causing the collimator transmission to decrease to about 40% .",
    "the lac collimator shows energy - dependent transmission effects due to reflection of soft x - rays ( below @xmath46  kev ) from the collimator walls at large offset angles ( turner et al .",
    "this low energy reflection was not taken into account when the intensities were corrected for collimator transmission ( sect .",
    "[ makingcdhid ] ) , which gives rise to an overestimation of the count rates for the lowest energy channels . when we encountered data with a collimator transmission below @xmath460 % we used figs .",
    "13 and 14 of turner et al .",
    "( 1989 ) in order to correct the count rates below 6 kev .",
    "usually this means that the count rates were corrected for an overestimation of 34% .",
    "sometimes the offset angle was even higher and the collimator transmission came below @xmath420% . at such high offset angle",
    "the collimator response is independent of incident photon energy ( turner et al .",
    "1989 ) . however , at these times the fractional uncertainty in the collimator transmission , and thus in the corrected count rates , due to aspect jitter is @xmath7 15% ( hertz et al .",
    "for this reason , we did not use any data with a collimator transmission @xmath8% in our analysis .      for our studies of the cds and the hids we used data rebinned to a time resolution of 4 seconds , which were background substracted and corrected for deadtime and aspect using the isas analysis system .",
    "the pc binned data were not corrected for background because no good background determinations are available for them .",
    "the 16 s resolution mpc1 data of the november 1990 and june 1991 observations had multiple register overflows and were left outside our analysis .",
    "the 4 s resolution mpc1 data of the june 1987 , the october 1989 , the may / june 1991 observations and the 2 s resolution mpc2 data of the june / october 1988 and the june 1991 observations had single overflows and the true count rates could be recovered . in order to make cds and hids we calculated the soft colour , the hard colour and the total intensity .",
    "the definitions of those quantities and the energy bands used in order to calculated them , are given in table [ bands ] .",
    "instead of the colours and intensities , usually used in the literature , we used the logarithmic value of those quantities . any process which influences the intensity in the specified energy bands by multiplication , i.e. the instrumental response",
    ", produces only a shift in the cd and the hids . using logarithmic values of the colours and the intensity",
    "therefore makes it easier to compare data of the same source obtained by different instruments , by simply shifting the diagrams . also , the  parametrization ( sect .",
    "[ sz ] ) in this way does not depend on the actual values of the quantities or the count rates , but only on their changes .",
    "it can now be used not only for the cd but for the hids as well .",
    "usually the total intensity was taken as the sum of the count rates in the same energy bands as were used to calculate the colours . however , for the pc data of the 1987 and the 1988 observations the total intensity was defined as the count rate in all four energy channels .",
    "for the 1989 pc data the count rates in the three lowest energy channels were summed , as the fourth channel only contained background photons .",
    "the lowest energy boundary of the 1987 pc data differs slightly from the lowest boundary in the 1988 pc data ( table  [ bands ] ) .",
    "the effect on the z in the cd and hid is negligible and therefore we discuss the 1987 and 1988 pc data together .",
    "the 1989 pc data is discussed seperately because of the different energy boundaries ( see below ) .    in order to compare the mpc1/2 data with the mpc3 data we rebinned the mpc1/2 data to 12 channels using the same energy boundaries as the mpc3 data .",
    "although in the 1991 observations the mpc3 data had slightly different energy boundaries compared to the mpc1/2 data ( table [ bands ] ) , the difference was small and had no significant effect on the place of the z in the cd and hid .",
    "due to the hv and cg levels of 1989 and 1990 observations ( energy range 1 - 60 kev ) the energy boundaries of their spectral channels differ from those of the other five observations . due to",
    "the broad energy channels the energy boundaries of these observations could not be succesfully interpolated to the boundaries of the others . therefore , we discuss the 1989 and 1990 observations",
    "seperately from the other observations . in order to get an approximately uniform analysis we took for the mpc1 mode data colours which resembles the colours used in the other observations .",
    "hasinger et al .",
    "( 1990 ) introduced the concept of rank number of the z track in the cd .",
    "this concept was refined by hertz et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and by dieters & van der klis ( 1996 ) .",
    "here we use the method described by dieters & van der klis ( 1996 ) for the measurement of the position along the z , with the difference that we perform all operations on the logarithmic colours and intensity values ( see sect .",
    "[ makingcdhid ] ) .",
    "we therefore transform the two logarithmic colour coordinates ( hard colour and soft colour ) into the coordinates   ( the distance along the z track ) and   ( the distance perpendicular to the z track ) . we also calculated the velocity ( ) and the acceleration ( ) along the z track , as defined as @xmath9/[{\\rm t}(i+1 ) - { \\rm t}(i-1)],\\ ] ] where ( i ) is the position in the z track on time t(i ) , and @xmath10/[{\\rm t}(i+1 ) - { \\rm t}(i-1)],\\ ] ] respectively ( see also dieters & van der klis ( 1996 ) ) .",
    "the length of the nb is scaled to 1 and positions on the hb and fb are normalised to the length of the nb .",
    "the hard vertex corresponds to = 1 , and the soft vertex to = 2 .",
    "we applied the  parametrization also on the z tracks in the hid .",
    "we obtained a different set of   and   values which we call   and .",
    "the distribution of   or   is a measure for the thickness of the branches in the cd or hid , respectively .",
    "to quantify the thickness of the branches we calculated the sample standard deviation of the   and   distributions using the method discribed in the appendix . as a measure of the overall velocity and acceleration in the cd",
    "the standard deviations of the   and   distribution were used , again using the method outlined in the appendix .      for the power - spectral analysis we used the mpc3 and pc data .",
    "we made ffts of 128s data segments which resulted a frequency range of 0.007864 hz ( mpc3 7.8 ms resolution data ) or 0.0078256 hz ( pc 1.95 ms resolution data ) in the power spectra .",
    "we calculated the ffts for the energy interval 1.218.6 kev ( june 1987 , june / october 1988 and may / june 1991 mpc3 observations ) or 1.219.0 kev ( november 1990 mpc3 observation ) . for the pc mode we used the sum of the energy intervals 0.812.3 kev and 0.69.1 kev ( june 1987 ) , or 0.812.3  kev and 0.89.1 kev ( june and october 1988 ) , or 1.217.9 kev and 1.215.7 kev ( october 1989 ) .",

    "so far , we find no evidence for any difference between the properties of the x - ray variability during different intensity levels on other parts of the z track ( such as the hb )",

    "it is thought ( van der klis et al .",
    "1985 , 1987 ; hasinger & van der klis 1989 ; lamb 1991 ) that variations in   are responsible for the changes in the rapid x - ray variability along the z and the formation of the z track , and that for this reason the rapid x - ray variability is closely related to the position of the source on the z track . however , the shifting and shape changing of the z track in cygnus  x-2 and other z sources suggest that variations in   can not explain all aspects of the formation of the z track .",
    "we , therefore , suggest that both the shape of the z track and the rapid x - ray variability are not totally determined by the mass accretion rate onto the compact object , but also partly by a so far unknown process , which may also cause the long - term intensity variations ( see sect .",

    "if the motion of the z track in the cd and hid in cygnus  x-2 , gx  5 - 1 , gx  340 + 0 are caused by the same phenonemon , we then predict that the rapid x - ray variability in gx  5 - 1 and gx  340 + 0 changes when the z tracks of those sources move through the diagram .",
    "the reason why so far no changes have been found is most likely due to the much lower amplitude of the motion of the z through the cd and hid of gx  5 - 1 and gx  340 + 0 , as compared to , which suggest that the amplitude of the difference of the rapid x - ray variability would also be much smaller .",
    "moreover , in cygnus  x-2 sofar only differences in the rapid x - ray variability were found near the soft vertex and not on e.g. the hb , while gx  5 - 1 and gx  340 + 0 were mainly observed in the hb and upper nb , and hardly near the soft vertex .",
    "kuulkers et al .",

    "van der klis ( 1991 ) suggested that the vlfn could be ( partly ) due to motion of the source along the z track . in our analysis , we found that both the vlfn fractional amplitude and the velocity of motion along the z track increase when the overall intensity level increases .",
    "however , the strongest vlfn was not observed during the most extreme high level , but during the less extreme , slightly lower one , whereas the highest velocity was indeed observed during the most extreme high level .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the motion along the z track is at most only partly responsible for the vlfn . as differences in nb slope in the hid can not explain this , part of the intensity variations causing the vlfn must take place perpendicular to the nb .",
    "the increase in velocity along the z track when the overall intensity increases indicates that the spectrum changes more rapidly during high level episodes than during medium level episodes .",

    "so , in the hid , when the source moves perpendicular to the z track ( change in intensity ) , it also moves along the z track ( change in spectrum ) .",
    "perhaps colours are well correlated with  , but the intensity varies also due to another ( unspecified ) process that is more prominent in the high overall intensity level .",
    "several models have been proposed ( priedhorsky & holt 1987 , and references therein ) in order to explain long - term intensity variations in x - ray binaries , e.g. long - term variations in   and precessing accretion disks .",
    "precessing neutron stars have also been proposed to explain the variations ( see priedhorsky & holt 1987 ; schwarzenberg - czerny 1992 , and references therein ) .",
    "long - term changes in the mass accretion rate have been proposed ( see priedhorsky & holt 1987 ) to explain the long - term intensity variations in low - mass x - ray binaries other than cygnus  x-2 ( e.g 4u  1820 - 30 , the rapid burster , aql  x-1 , excluding her  x-1 ) . however , kuulkers et al .",
    "( 1996a ) and wijnands et al .",
    "( 1996b ) argued that the long - term intensity variations in cygnus  x-2 can not be due to variations in the mass accretion rate .",
    "the main argument is that variations in the mass accretion rate are thought to produce motion of the source along the z track ( see e.g. hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) , while the z track is observed during several different intensity levels .      in order to explain",
    "long term intensity variations , not related to orbital variations , in high - mass x - ray binaries and her x-1 , precessing accretion disks have been proposed ( see priedhorsky & holt 1987 and references therein ) . the recent detection ( smale et al . 1996 , wijnands et al .",
    "1996b ) of a 78 day period in the rxte , vela 5b ( see also smale & lochner 1992 ) and ariel v all sky monitor data of cygnus  x-2 favours a precessing accretion disk in cygnus  x-2 .",
    "however , explaining the long - term x - ray variations of cygnus  x-2 with a precessing accretion disk is not without serious contradictions .",
    "if we assume that , during the medium overall intensity level , the emission region is blocked by ( part of ) the accretion disk and much radiation is absorbed , scattered and/or reflected , the power spectrum should be blurred and quasi - periodic oscillations ( both the nbo and the hbo ) should be harder to detect than when the emission region is not blocked by the accretion disk ( the high level ) .",
    "however , we see exactly the opposite : no nbo is detected during high overall intensity levels .",
    "the upper limits are significantly lower than the actually detected values during the medium levels . if we assume that not during the medium level but during the high level the emission region is blocked by the accretion disk , then the difference between the power spectra are not totally unexpected .",
    "however , it is difficult to explain the increase of the count rate when the accretion disk is blocking our view of the emission region .",
    "another possibility is that the accretion disk blocks , during the medium overall intensity levels , a localised emission area ( e.g. the neutron star surface ) , which is not blocked during the high levels . in this region",
    "no nbo occurs and therefore the fractional amplitude of the nbo during the high level is diluted by the additional flux .",
    "however , not only the strength of the nbo should be affected , but also the strength of the hbo , except when the hbo would originate from this localised area , in which case we would expect an inverse effect .",
    "this , however , is unlikely , because during all intensity levels hbos are observed at approximately the same fractional amplitude .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that the increase in count rates from the medium to the high level is caused by an localised emission region , which is sometimes hidden from our view by a precessing accretion disk , or by a precessing accretion disk , which sometimes blocks part of the total x - ray radiation . kuulkers et al.(1996a ) proposed that the difference in overall count rates in the cyg - like sources is caused by anisotropic emission , the radiation being scattered preferentially into the equatorial plane by a puffed - up inner disk structure . in this model , with increased scattering in the high level , the decrease in nbo amplitude follows naturally due to light travel time effects in the scattering process .",
    "our observations therefore support their model .",
    "another option is that the differences between the levels are due to changes in the properties of the emission region .",
    "a precessing neutron star could produce changes in the inner disk region . due to the precession of the neutron star the orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the accretion disk changes . according to numerical calculations ( psaltis et al .",
    "1995 ) the strength of the magnetic field is enough for the field to have a profound effect on the spectrum of the source and possibly also on the count rate .",
    "a change in the effective magnetic field , caused by a different orientation of the field , could maybe explain the different z tracks during the different levels .",
    "also , the rapid x - ray variability would be affected , although it is not clear if this could explain the differences that we found .",
    "the behaviour of the hbo should differ between the different intensity levels due to the different effective magnetic field , but no difference is found . it is also not clear why the nbo should differ between intensity levels .      the decrease of the hbo frequency from the hard vertex down the nb in the june 1987 and october 1989 pc data allows us to apply the method described by wijnands et al .",
    "( 1996a ) , in order to derive an upper limit for the equatorial magnetic field strength . assuming that the radius of the neutron star is @xmath41",
    "cm we derive an upper limit of @xmath42 g on the star s magnetic field at the magnetic equator .",
    "this value is similar to the value found for gx 17 + 2 ( wijnands et al .",
    "this upper limit is consistent with numerical computations on the x - ray spectrum of cygnus  x-2 ( psaltis et al .",
    "1995 ) . as noted by wijnands et al .",
    "( 1996a ) , a further decrease of the frequency down the nb will reduce this upper limit .",
    "the fact that we see the hbo frequency decrease on the nb in cygnus  x-2 supports the interpretation that the qpo on the nb in gx  17 + 2 , which also decreases in frequency ( wijnands et al .",
    "1996a ) , is the hbo .",
    "we observed cygnus  x-2 over a broad range of intensities .",
    "the source alternated between the known medium and high overall intensity levels and also sometimes in a state in between these two levels , both in intensity and other source characteristics .",
    "we found new correlations between several characteristics of the source and the overall intensity level :    * the velocity and acceleration along the normal branch increase when the overall intensity increases . during the high intensity level cygnus  x-2 moves",
    "faster and more irregularly up and down the normal branch than during lower levels . *",
    "the width of the normal branch in the hardness - intensity diagram increases when the overall intensity increases . *",
    "the very - low frequency noise near the soft vertex increases in amplitude and in steepness when the overall intensity increases .",
    "* the normal branch quasi - periodic oscillation is not detectable ( @xmath40 0.9 % rms ) near the soft vertex when   is in the high level . during the other levels",
    "a nbo can be easily detected at a level of 12.5 % ( rms ) .",
    "the following correlations were already known and are confirmed by our analysis :    * the overall intensity changes with a factor of @xmath41.34 between the medium and the high overall intensity level . *",
    "the shape of the z - track in the colour - colour diagram and hardness - intensity diagram changes when the overall intensity changes . in the colour - colour diagram",
    "the horizontal and the flaring branch become more horizontal when the overall intensity increases . when the source enters the flaring branch during the medium overall intensity level the intensity first increases and later decreases .",
    "when the source enters the flaring branch during the high overall intensity level the intensity immediately starts to decrease .",
    "* the whole z - track shifts to softer colours when the overall intensity increases .",
    "we also found several other previously unreported phenomena :    * clear detection of overall intensity level episodes in - between the medium and the high overall intensity level , indicating that the different overall intensity levels are part of a continouos range instead of a discrete set . *",
    "the frequency of the horizontal branch quasi - periodic oscillation decreases down the nb , giving a model dependent upper limit on the magnetic field strength at the magnetic equator of @xmath43 g. * detection of five bursts in the ginga data , which do not show the characteristics of bona fide type i bursts .",
