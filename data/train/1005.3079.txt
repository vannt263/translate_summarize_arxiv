    "the exclusion process is a continuous time interacting particle system where particles move as independent random walks on a graph except for the exclusion rule that prevents two particles from occupying the same site , or vertex . in the symmetric case",
    ", the process evolves as follows : to each bond we associate a waiting exponential time , which are independent of the waiting time for any other bond ; at the waiting time the occupancies of the sites connected by the bond are exchanged ; the parameter of the exchange times , or exchange rate , depends only on the bond .",
    "the especification of the exchange rates determines the environments for the exclusion process . in our case , as the underlying graph , we consider the discrete torus with @xmath9 points and nearest neighbor bonds .",
    "the variable @xmath10 is the scaling parameter .",
    "this paper studies the hydrodynamical behavior of symmetric exclusion processes in non - homogeneous environments with the presence of slow bonds .",
    "here we mean non - constant environments where a usual bond has exchange rate one and a slow bond has exchange rate lower than one .",
    "with respect to the scaling parameter , we assume that a slow bond has exchange rate of order @xmath6 . when the environment is constant , the exclusion process has a well - known hydrodynamical behavior under diffusive scaling , but , in the presence of slow bonds , particles will not move fast enough to garantee that we still have an hydrodynamic behavior in diffusive scaling .",
    "hydrodynamics in diffusive scaling have been obtained in several cases , even when the environment is random and consists only of slow bonds .",
    "for one dimensional processes , in @xcite , the exchange rate over a bond @xmath11 $ ] is given by @xmath12^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath13 is an @xmath14-stable subordinator of a lvy process .",
    "they obtain a quenched hydrodynamic limit . in papers",
    "previous to @xcite , for example @xcite and @xcite , the randomness or non - homogenity did not survive in the continuum limit .",
    "an also one - dimensional result , following @xcite , was obtained in @xcite , for more general , but non - random , increasing functions @xmath13 . the techniques used in those papers were strongly based on theorems about convergence of one dimensional continuous time stochastic processes .",
    "in fact , even the @xmath1-dimensional case treated in @xcite has considered a class of non - homogeneous environments that could be decomposed , in a proper sense , in @xmath1 one - dimensional cases .",
    "recently , different approaches have been searched to deal with @xmath1-dimensional environments , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we now describe the exclusion processes we are concerned .",
    "let @xmath15 be the canonical base of @xmath16 and @xmath17 be a simple connected region with smooth boundary @xmath8 .",
    "if the bond @xmath18 \\in n^{-1 } { { \\mathbb t}}^d_n$ ] has vertices in each of the regions @xmath0 and @xmath4 , its exchange rate is defined as @xmath6 times the absolute value of the inner product between @xmath5 and the normal exterior vector to @xmath7 . for others edges ,",
    "the exchange rate is defined as one .",
    "this means that the slow bonds are among those crossing the boundary of @xmath0 .",
    "we call this process the exclusion process with slow bonds over @xmath7 .    we can interpret @xmath7 as a permeable membrane , which slows down the passage of particles between the regions @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "for this type of exclusion process , the membrane does not completely prevent the passage of particles , and still survives in the continuum limit , appearing explicitely in the hydrodynamic equation .",
    "the exchange rate of particles for a bond crossing @xmath7 is smaller if the bond is close to a tangent line of @xmath7 .",
    "note that this assumption has physical meaning , take for example cases of reflections in several physical models : partial reflection of light crossing a media with diferent refraction indexes , mechanical systems where particles try to cross some interface , etc .",
    "however the direction of the speed of particles is not changed as usually occur in physical reflection .",
    "our definition of the exchange rates also allows a strong convergence result for the empirical measures associated to the exclusion process making simpler the proof of the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "the hydrodynamical equation of the exclusion process with slow bonds over @xmath7 is a parabolic partial differential equation @xmath19 , where the operator @xmath20 is a sort of @xmath1-dimensional krein - feller operator . without the presence of slow bonds ,",
    "the operator @xmath20 would be replaced by the laplacian operator acting on @xmath21 functions and the hydrodynamical equation is therefore the heat equation . here",
    ", the existence of the membrane modifies the domain , and thus the operator itself .",
    "in fact , we observe that the proper domain for @xmath20 contains functions that are discontinuous over @xmath7 .",
    "geometrically , @xmath20 glues the discontinuity of a function around @xmath7 and then behaves like the laplacian .",
    "one possible approach to prove the hydrodynamic limit for the exclusion process with slow bonds over @xmath7 is through gamma convergence . in @xcite , this approach and the conditions for it to hold",
    "are discussed , see also @xcite . there",
    ", the coersiveness condition would require some kind of rellich - kondrachov s theorem ( namely , the compact embedding in @xmath22 of some sort of sobolev space supporting an extension of @xmath20 , see @xcite ) . in the method presented here , we go in this direction , but instead of reach the hypotheses in @xcite , we have use similar the analytical tools to obtain a short and simple proof of uniqueness of the hydrodynamic equation .",
    "we also show that the extension of @xmath20 satisfies the hille - yoshida theorem . on the other hand ,",
    "the convergence from discrete to continuous that we present here is made in very direct way , and it was inspired by the convergence of the discrete laplacian to the continuous laplacian .",
    "the paper is presented as follows : in section [ 2 ] , we define the model and state all results proved to be proved in the paper ; section [ 3 ] is devoted to prove all the results concerning to the continuous operator @xmath20 ; in section [ 4 ] , the hydrodynamic limit is proved .",
    "let @xmath2 be the @xmath1-dimensional torus , which is @xmath23 with periodic boundary conditions , and @xmath24 be the discrete torus with @xmath9 points , which is @xmath25 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we denote by @xmath26 a typical configuration in the state space @xmath27 , for which , @xmath28 means that site @xmath29 is vacant , and @xmath30 that site @xmath29 is occupied . if a bond of @xmath3 has vertices @xmath31 and @xmath32 , it will be denoted by @xmath33 $ ] .",

    ", the exchange rate of a bond crossing the boundary @xmath7 is also of order @xmath6 , but it depends on the angle of incidence : the crossing of @xmath7 by a particle gets harder to happen as the direction of entrance gets closer to the tangent plane to the surface @xmath7 .    from now on , the rates in the definition of @xmath61 will always be given by [ rates ] .",

    "the exclusion process with slow bonds over @xmath7 has a related random walk on @xmath3 that describes the evolution of the system with a single particle .",
    "thus particles in the exclusion process evolve independently as such random walk except for the hard core interaction . to simplify notation later ,",
