    "it is well known that general relativity ( gr ) and the standard particle model ( spm ) are not able to describe all the phenomena in the universe .",
    "there are three possible ways to overcome these difficulties @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the first one is to add some new content in the universe , like dm and de ) .",
    "the second one is to modify the theory of gravity . and",
    "the third one is some combination of the previous two .",
    "nowadays , the need for dm and de is firmly established in cmb , large - scale structure formation , galaxy clusters , galaxy rotational curves , and in accelerated expansion , high redshift type ia supernovae , etc .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite ) , but their physical nature still remains a mystery .",
    "one of the possibilities for modification of gr is through the f(r ) theories .",
    "they generalize gr by replacing the scalar @xmath2 in the hilbert - einstein action with some function @xmath3 .",
    "unfortunately , the physical intuition can not help find the explicit form of the function f(r ) @xcite . at present",
    "we have not enough observational and experimental data to choose it . as a result",
    ", a lot of such functions could be found in the literature .",
    "for example , @xcite .",
    "more extensive information about the @xmath3 theories can be found in @xcite .",
    "the mdg as a proper generalization of the einstein gr was first introduced by @xcite .",
    "his point was just to give some field - theoretical basis for the `` fifth force '' introduced by @xcite where the term `` dilaton field '' was used in this context for the first time . sometimes , this model is called also the `` massive branse - dicke model with the parameter @xmath4 '' @xcite . following @xcite , the paper @xcite used also the term dilaton for the branse - dicke scalar field @xmath1 .    later on ,",
    "the name mdg was introduced in @xcite to distinguish the ohanlon model from other models with different kinds of dilaton fields used in different physical areas . in @xcite",
    "there were considered , also for the first time , astrophysical and cosmological applications of mdg , and the cosmological constant @xmath5 and cosmological units were introduced , to look for new areas of application of the simple ohanlon model . after that the initial period of development of the mdg model , in @xcite its different applications , as well as further justifications of the general theory were considered .",
    "the mdg is a simple extension of gr based on the following action of the gravi - dilaton sector : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the einstein constant , @xmath8 is the newton gravitational constant , @xmath5 is the cosmological constant , and @xmath9 is the gravitation - dilaton field .",
    "the values of @xmath1 must be positive because a change of the sign would lead to a change of the sign of the gravitational factor @xmath10 , which would lead to antigravity .",
    "we rule out the possibility of antigravity , since it does not correspond to known real physical facts .",
    "the value @xmath11 must be excluded , because in this case the gravity is eliminated .",
    "the value @xmath12 is also unacceptable since it leads to an infinite gravitational factor , and the cauchy problem is not well posed @xcite .",
    "the branse - dicke gravitational dilaton field @xmath1 is introduced in order to have a variable gravitational factor @xmath13 instead of gravitational constant @xmath8 .",
    "the dilaton @xmath1 does not enter in the action of the matter @xmath14 , because it has no interaction with ordinary matter of spm .",
    "due to its specific physical meaning the dilaton @xmath1 has unusual properties .",
    "the function @xmath15 defines the cosmological potential and the whole extra dynamics of the model .",
    "it is introduced in order to have a variable cosmological factor instead of the cosmological constant @xmath5 .",
    "the potential @xmath15 must be a singe valued function of the dilaton field due to astrophysical reasons .",
    "if we set @xmath16 and @xmath17 , we are back into gr with the @xmath5 term .",
    "a special class of potentials are introduced in @xcite .",
    "they are called withholding potentials and they confine dynamically the values of the dilaton @xmath1 in the physical domain . in @xcite",
    "it is also shown that the mdg model is only locally equivalent to the @xmath3 theories .",
    "the case of absence of such global equivalence leads to different physical consequences .",
    "unfortunately , in the large existing literature one is not able to find functions @xmath3 which are globally equivalent to the mdg model with the withholding potentials @xmath15 .",
    "there , only formal equivalence based on the helmholtz approach in classical mechanics is sometimes discussed .    in @xcite ,",
    "mdg modifications of the classical gr effects in the solar system are considered : nordvedt effect , shapiro effect , perihelion shift , etc . in the weak field approximation ,",
    "mdg is compatible with all known observational data if the mass of the dilaton @xmath18 is large enough , i.e. , if @xmath19 .",
    "we also have an estimate from cosmology @xcite @xmath20 .",
    "the value of the dilaton mass @xmath18 is the main open physical problem in mdg , as well as in the locally equivalent to it @xmath3 theories , and in other extended theories of gravity .",
    "the field equation of mdg with matter fields can be found in @xcite .",
    "they can be written in the following form , with @xmath21 : @xmath22 @xmath23    here @xmath24 is the standard stress - energy tensor and @xmath25 is its trace .",
    "we use the standard notation for the einstein tensor @xmath26 .",
    "the dilatonic potential @xmath27 is introduced through its first derivative with respect of the dilaton , @xmath28 .    in the papers @xcite",
    "there were considered models of static spherically symmetric neutron stars ( ns ) with different eos of the matter : ideal fermi gas at zero temperature , polytropic eos , and realistic eos amp1 .",
    "detailed derivation of the basic equations and the boundary conditions are given in @xcite .",
    "some general problems of singular and bifurcation manifolds for such stars were considered in @xcite .    the present paper deals with static ns with four other realistic eos of matter : sly , bsk19 , bsk20 , and bsk21 .",
    "it confirms and extends the basic results of the previous papers and completes the general picture of the mdg models of statically spherically symmetric ns .",
    "with great precision , the static ns are spherically symmetric objects .",
    "so in the problem under consideration we can use the standard space - time interval , @xcite , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the radial luminosity variable .",
    "the inner domain @xmath31 $ ] , where @xmath32 is the luminosity radius of the star , the structure is described by the following system of four first order differential equations , which represent the specific mdg generalization of the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations : @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36    here we have four unknown functions , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the mass , the pressure , the dilaton and the dilaton pressure .",
    "the following notations are used in the system : @xmath39        in the above equation @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the cosmological energy density and cosmological pressure , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the dilaton energy density and dilaton pressure .",
    "we combine cosmological , dilaton and matter energy density in a new variable @xmath44 .",
    "we do the same thing for the cosmological , dilaton and matter pressure in the variable @xmath45 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
