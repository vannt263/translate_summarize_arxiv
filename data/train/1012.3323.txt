    "in wireless communication , systems with multiple antenna arrays at both ends of the link are called mimo ( multiple input multiple output ) .",
    "the main interest is to compute the number of bits / s which can be transmitted by these systems .",
    "it has been shown that this quantity , called channel capacity @xcite , is linked with the transfer matrix @xmath1 whose element @xmath2 is the ratio between the complex current intensity @xmath3 at the load of the @xmath4 receiving ( rx ) antenna over the current @xmath5 which feeds the @xmath6 transmitting ( tx ) antenna . if @xmath7 and @xmath8 are respectively the number of @xmath9 antennas and @xmath10 antennas , then @xmath1 is a @xmath11 matrix .",
    "even if one can experimentally determine @xmath1 in a given environment when the antennas are fixed , its entries show such large variations when moving the antennas arrays from place to place that the knowledge of @xmath1 for some number of locations seems to be insufficient for having an idea of the capacity everywhere .",
    "fortunately , it seems that the eigenvalue distribution of the matrix @xmath12 ( here @xmath13 means adjoint ) is more robust with respect to the displacements , but this has to be better understood . in order to mimic the variations of the entries of @xmath1 ,",
    "one possibility is to replace @xmath1 by random matrices introducing several distributions for their elements ( see @xcite ) . in sharp contrast with this method",
    ", we try to understand the variations through the physical study of the wave propagation in a given environment .",
    "thus we employ a deterministic modeling method and our aim is to describe @xmath14 by quantities linked with the physical characteristics of the antennas and the environment . but certain stochastic aspects can naturally appear if some parameters of the scatterers present in the medium are described by stochastic variables ( like position , density etc ) .",
    "this work was motivated by the existence of an heuristic formula intensively used by the mimo signal experts .",
    "it appeared in the works of b.fleury et al .",
    "see e.g. @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "this formula describes the transfer matrix in the following way : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a direction of departure from the @xmath10 side where @xmath17 are respectively its azimuth and elevation angles and @xmath18 is a direction of arrival at the @xmath9 side , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are respectively @xmath21 and @xmath22 matrices whose elements depend only on the corresponding antennas diagrams and the geometry of the arrays , while @xmath23 is a @xmath24 matrix which depends only on the environment .",
    "our aim is to understand this formula from first principles , that is solving the maxwell equations in a typical complex environment formed by the @xmath10 and @xmath9 antenna arrays surrounded by buildings , persons , trees ... the antennas are pieces of metal described by their geometry and by their conductivity @xmath25 , while the scatterers which are made of dielectric and magnetic materials can also be described by their geometry , permittivity , permeability and conductivity .    to determine @xmath2 one introduces in the second member of the maxwell equations a harmonic current density @xmath26 , in a small volume constituted by a part of the wire which connects the @xmath6 signal source to the antenna .",
    "the current intensity crossing a section @xmath27 of the wire is @xmath28 .",
    "if one knows the electric fields @xmath29 induced by this current density , in particular at a section @xmath30 of the wire connecting the @xmath4 rx antenna to its load , there one can calculate the current density using the ohm law @xmath31 and deduce the current crossing this section , @xmath32 . then @xmath33 ; note that this formula is true when only the @xmath34th emitting antenna is fed with current . for the general case see the discussion around .    to tackle these calculations ,",
    "wave propagation experts try to address the difficulties in the following manner .",
    "they suppose that they know the electromagnetic fields ( em ) fields radiated by the @xmath6 @xmath10 antenna in the free space .",
    "these fields are considered as incoming fields in a scattering problem where the scatterers are constituted by buildings , persons , trees ... and they try to calculate the total fields produced adding the incoming fields and the scattered fields .",
    "this is in fact a difficult problem which is only solved analytically in some very simple and unrealistic situations . practically it is solved using the geometrical optics approximation ( ray tracing ) .",
    "finally , the total @xmath35 fields calculated in this way are considered as incoming fields for the @xmath4 @xmath9 antenna and , once more , one is faced with a scattering problem where now the @xmath9 antennas play the role of scatterers and again one has to determine the new total fields , from which one obtains @xmath3 .",
    "one of the purposes of the paper is to justify this procedure .",
    "we succeed in proving that when the antennas are sufficiently small and spatially separated from the surrounding scatterers , the @xmath35 fields calculated with the procedure explained above appear as the first term in a series giving the exact fields . in lemmas [ lemma1 ] and [ lemma2 ] we give an approximation for the total green function which puts into evidence the decoupling between the @xmath10 antennas , the @xmath9 antennas and the surrounding scatterers .",
    "our proposed methodology is to use the vector potential formalism to solve the maxwell equations .",
    "our main mathematical tool is geometric perturbation theory for closed but non - selfadjoint operators .",
    "these methods have been developed for apparently unrelated quantum scattering problems in @xcite and they can be used for describing the propagation of electromagnetic waves in frequency domain .    in corollary [ corollary1 ]",
    "we derive a stronger version of the fleury heuristic formula as a corollary of theorem [ theorem1 ] , in the case when the antenna arrays are far away from the surrounding scatterers .",
    "in particular , we link the heuristic `` spread matrix function '' @xmath36 to the green function of the environment alone .    in this paper",
    "the language is deliberately made free of too technical notions of functional analysis and operator theory in order to facilitate the understanding for non - mathematicians .",
    "some notions concerning the limiting absorbtion principle for the non self adjoint operators coming from the vector potential description of the @xmath35 fields are not yet proved , so this paper has to be completed in this respect in order to get rigorously the set of frequencies for which the green operators exist when the `` energy '' tends to a real number , as operators in certain weighted @xmath37 spaces .    on the other hand , this paper is a starting point to more applied engineering works since now we understand the link between the heuristic `` spread function '' in formula ( [ februar13 ] ) and the scattering transfer operator of the environment .      throughout this paper",
    "the configuration space will be @xmath38 .",
    "the environment is known , which means that we assume the knowledge of the dielectric constant @xmath39 and the conductivity @xmath25 .",
    "they are smooth functions of the position and frequency .",
    "there are no magnetic effects , that is @xmath40 is constant .",
    "let us assume that we know the current density @xmath41 ( i.e. in time domain ) at the entrance of the transmitting antenna .",
    "it is completely determined by the transmission device .",
    "[ asump1 ] the current density @xmath26 has the following generic properties :    * it is smooth in the time variable ; * it is compactly supported in @xmath42 ; * @xmath43 is a smooth function , compactly supported in @xmath44\\cup [ \\omega_1,\\omega_2]$ ] .",
    "this equality is a consequence of the reality of @xmath41 .",
    "there is an inherent physical imprecision on the very notion of `` external '' source current , since this quantity is supposed to be completely determined by the transmitter .",
    "it is common to assume that the current densities on the wires feeding the transmitting antennas are constant on the disc of the corresponding cross sections .",
    "but this fact does not affect the conclusions of our paper .",
    "[ asump2 ] further technical assumptions on the environment :    * @xmath45 and @xmath46 are smooth in @xmath42 .",
    "the case with piecewise constant @xmath39 requires a rather complicated regularization procedure which will be considered elsewhere ; * the dielectric constant of the air is constant and equals @xmath47 ; * @xmath48 + where all the relative @xmath49 s are compactly supported perturbations , with disjoint supports . here",
    "@xmath50 means the transmitting antenna(s ) , @xmath51 the receiver(s ) , and @xmath7 the scatterer(s ) . *",
    "the conductivity can be written @xmath52 where the @xmath25 s are compactly supported on the regions containing the antennas .",
    "in the frequency domain , the electric and magnetic fields @xmath29 and @xmath53 satisfy the following system of equations : @xmath54 here we incorporate ohm s law in , in the sense that an electric field @xmath29 generates a charge - current density @xmath55 in metals .",
    "we stress that we do not work with perfect conducting antennas ; taking @xmath25 to infinity is a singular operation within our formalism , and the study of this limit is a very interesting mathematical problem which is left as an open problem .",
    "we note that one can start with infinite conductivities right from the beginning , but the price is that one needs to deal with severely ill - posed inverse problems ( see e.g. @xcite ) .      equations and",
    "allow us to eliminate the unknown charge density @xmath56 : @xmath57 equation allows us to represent @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a magnetic vector potential .",
    "using this in gives @xmath60 , thus there exists a scalar potential @xmath61 such that : @xmath62 introducing the magnetic vector potential in and using we obtain : @xmath63 note the important thing that if we have a pair @xmath64 which solves , then is automatically satisfied because the left hand side of is divergence free .",
    "thus we have the freedom of choosing a @xmath61 completely determined by @xmath65 through a lorenz - type gauge condition , and then solve for @xmath59 . denoting by @xmath66 such a special solution",
    ", we choose : @xmath67 with this choice , simplifies to : @xmath68 introducing the notation @xmath69 we can rewrite as : @xmath70 now if we have a solution to , then the fields @xmath71 and @xmath53 are given by : @xmath72    denoting by @xmath73 and using @xmath74 ( see ) we have : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is smooth and compactly supported .",
    "note that @xmath77 can not be zero if @xmath78 .",
    "define the following first order differential operator @xmath79 in the following way : @xmath80 and observe that it is relatively compact with respect to @xmath81 on the hilbert space @xmath82 ^ 3 $ ] .",
    "moreover , the operator sum @xmath83 is closed on the sobolev space @xmath84 ^ 3 $ ] , and if @xmath85 then we can define the inverse @xmath86 for at least when @xmath87 is large enough .",
    "the solution we are looking for in is : @xmath88 where we have to give a rigorous sense to the limiting absorption principle .",
    "the problem is far from being trivial because the perturbation @xmath79 is not symmetric ; technical details and full proofs will be given elsewhere .",
    "we only want to mention that under rather general conditions , the limit in is expected to hold outside a discrete set of frequencies . in order to simplify the notation",
    ", we stop writing @xmath89 .",
    "having determined @xmath66 , we can derive @xmath29 from :    @xmath90    let us be more precise and assume that we have @xmath91 transmitting antennas for which we can write : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the current running through the tranverse section of the @xmath34-th antenna , and @xmath94 is its corresponding normalized current density ( i.e. the flux integral of any @xmath94 through the transverse section of antenna @xmath34 equals one ) .    according to , the receiving region has a conductivity @xmath95 .",
    "let us assume that there are @xmath96 disjoint receiving antennas so that we can write : @xmath97 via ohm s law @xmath98 we determine the current density at the @xmath99-th receiving antenna .",
    "assume that @xmath100 is the transverse section of the @xmath99-th receiving antenna .",
    "then the current induced in it will be :    @xmath101    the transfer matrix elements @xmath2 are only frequency dependent and give the current induced in the @xmath99-th receiving antenna when only the @xmath34-th transmitting antenna is fed with current .",
    "one must note that the above formula takes into consideration all possible couplings . in the rest of the paper we will try to reduce the complexity of this formula and to arrive to a simpler and practically more convenient expression .",
    "it is important to realize that the resolvent @xmath102 contains the whole information about both the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "we will express this resolvent and thus @xmath2 in a different way , which shows a decoupling between transmitters , receivers and scatterers .",
    "let us introduce some notation which would describe a situation in which only the transmitter would be present : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is again smooth and supported only near the transmitter(s ) . in a similar way we introduce the corresponding quantities for @xmath7 and @xmath51 .",
    "the perturbation corresponding only to the transmitter(s ) @xmath105 is : @xmath106 and similar objects can be defined for @xmath51 and @xmath7 .",
    "let us introduce the following operators : @xmath107 here @xmath108 only takes into consideration the perturbation induced by the transmitter(s ) , @xmath109 does the same thing for the environment , and @xmath110 for the receiver(s ) .",
    "assume that both the transmitter(s ) and receiver(s ) are separated from all other scatterers , and from each other ( see figure 1 for what follows ) .",
    "figure 1 .",

    "let us also note the identity : @xmath126    since we assumed @xmath127 , we can choose a smooth function @xmath128 such that @xmath129 take a point in @xmath123 as the origin of coordinates and let @xmath130 .",

    "we obtain : @xmath169 now use in the right hand side of .",
    "we obtain : @xmath170 but the first term on the rhs of the above equality is zero , again due to the supports . finally , use in the above equation , and the proof is over .    _",
    "remark_. note that @xmath171 is the operator entering in giving the general transfer matrix element , because @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "although is an * exact * formula , it is not very useful yet because in the middle of the right hand side we still have the full resolvent and not just the resolvent corresponding to the environment .",
    "but in the next subsection we will show that @xmath174 can be better and better approximated with @xmath175 if the space occupied by the antennas become smaller and smaller compared to the distances between different objects .",
    "remember that @xmath139 and @xmath140 are the characteristic functions of two spherical annuli which are at a distance @xmath127 from both the transmitter(s ) and the receiver(s ) .",
    "if the physical space occupied by our antennas becomes very small ( mathematically this means that the volume of the supports of @xmath177 and @xmath117 i.e. of @xmath123 and @xmath120 is very small ) , then it would be natural to be able to approximate @xmath176 with @xmath178 .",
    "let us show this here .",
    "[ lemma2 ] let @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "then outside a discrete set of frequencies , the vector potential can be approximated in any @xmath181 norm with @xmath182 in the following way : @xmath183^{-1}\\chi_{t_a }   k_t(k_0 ^ 2+j0_+){{\\bf j}}_{\\rm in}=o(\\max\\{v_t , v_r\\}).\\ ] ]    in the appendix we have formulated a lippmann - schwinger type representation of the total resolvent in the presence of @xmath8 perturbations , see .",
    "we want to particularize that formula for @xmath184 objects .",
    "we put @xmath185 , we take @xmath105 to be @xmath186 , and @xmath187 will be @xmath188 .",
    "the formula reads as : @xmath189 this implies : @xmath190 now the idea is to show that the right hand side of is small when the volume of the supports of @xmath191 and @xmath192 are smaller and smaller .",
    "we need to estimate the norm of the operator @xmath193 the factor @xmath194 is a hilbert - schmidt operator and its hilbert - schmidt norm tends to zero like @xmath195 .",
    "a similar result holds true for @xmath196 .",
    "it means that the right hand side of is close to zero when the linear dimensions of our antennas become very small .",
    "we can thus write : @xmath197 outside of a discrete set of frequencies .",
    "this proves the lemma for the @xmath198 norm ; one can actually show that this convergence is also true in any @xmath199 norm ; the ingredients are the elliptic regularity and the fact that the supports of @xmath177 , @xmath117 , @xmath140 and @xmath139 are disjoint .",
    "the proof is over .    _",
    "remark_. an obvious interpretation of this formula is the following : the input current is transformed into a signal by @xmath200 ( only depending on the transmitter(s ) ) and sent into the annulus given by @xmath139 .",
    "from there , @xmath109 scatters the signal into the observation region of the receiver(s ) , or @xmath140 .",
    "finally , @xmath201 takes over the signal and sends it to the receiver(s ) .",
    "note that the diameters of @xmath139 and @xmath140 _ do not have to be large _ , and this is exactly what happens when some scatterers are close to our antennas .",
    "but _ the linear dimensions of the emitting and receveing antennas have to be small _ in order to be sure that we can approximate @xmath202 with @xmath203 .",
    "another important observation : if the linear dimensions of the antennas are important relatively to the other distances in our decomposition , then the expression in is not correct .",
    "we would need to take into consideration the complete formula for the full resolvent , because we can no longer ignore the higher order coupling between the emitting and receiving antennas given by the * exact * formula .",
    "remember that the transfer matrix in is completely characterized by the value of @xmath204 .",
    "in this subsection we assume that the antennas are small enough so that makes a good approximation . in order to simplify notation , we write @xmath205 instead of @xmath206 .",
    "all the resolvents we have considered until now are integral operators in the following sense : @xmath207 their integral kernels are smooth functions of @xmath42 and @xmath208 outside the diagonal @xmath209 , due to general elliptic regularity results .",
    "we will now express the quantity in with the help of the various integral kernels appearing in that equality . using and we may write ( here @xmath210 ) : @xmath211 in order to simplify the notation",
    ", we will assume that the transmitters are located near the origin of coordinates , while the receivers are located near @xmath212 .",
    "in this formula we will choose @xmath213 to be a mollifier of the characteristic function of the ball @xmath214 , and @xmath215 to be a mollifier of the characteristic function of @xmath216 .",
    "in @xmath217 we may choose to work with local spherical coordinates @xmath218 , with @xmath219 and @xmath220 .",
    "the same thing can be done for @xmath221 , and denote its local spherical coordinates by @xmath222 .",
    "we choose @xmath213 and @xmath215 to be radial in these coordinates .",
    "then as they converge towards the characteristic functions , one can prove that the expression in converges to : @xmath223 perform the radial integrals and write @xmath224 as a sum of four terms : @xmath225 let us introduce the notation ( boldface @xmath226 indicates @xmath227 matrices ) : @xmath228 and @xmath229 then the key equation can be rewritten as :    @xmath230    where the transposition operation is considered with respect to the @xmath24 structure .    already here",
    "we can see the complete separation between the transmitters , receivers , and the rest of the scatterers in the environment . introducing this formula back into , we prove the following theorem :    [ theorem1]in the case in which the linear dimensions of the emitting and receiving antennas are small , we can approximate the transfer matrix elements by the formula : @xmath231 where @xmath232 denotes the usual dot - product in @xmath233 , while @xmath234 are two six - dimensional vectors only depending on the transmitters and receivers respectively .",
    "they characterize the radiation pattern of our transmitting and receiving antennas , and they do not change with the environment .      the key mathematical object which completely characterizes how the various scatterers affect the signal is the green function of the environment @xmath235 .",
    "we will try to obtain some relatively simple formulas for this green function .",
    "we have already given in the appendix a fairly general expression for the resolvent in the presence of @xmath8 scatterers , see and .",
    "we would like to give an even simpler , yet generic expression of this green function when the distance between the scatterers and the two balls @xmath236 and @xmath237 is large enough .",
    "as before , let us use @xmath238 .",
    "assume that the total number of these scatterers is @xmath239 .",
    "the free green function is given by the well known formula @xmath240 let us denote by @xmath241 its associated operator .",
    "then gives : @xmath242 here the operator @xmath243 contains all possible interactions between various scatterers present in the environment .",
    "now assume that the distance between scatterers and the observation points @xmath244 and @xmath245 is much larger than the radius @xmath132 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "figure 2 .        then if @xmath246 and @xmath247 are in the support of the scatterers we may write : @xmath248 and @xmath249 therefore @xmath250    using some elliptic regularity estimates and integration by parts , one can prove the existence of some @xmath251 matrices @xmath252 and @xmath253 which are jointly continuous as functions of @xmath254 and @xmath255 on the support of @xmath256 and @xmath257 such that : @xmath258 where @xmath259 is as in ( i.e. the minimal distance between the emittors / receivers and the scatterers of the environment ) .",
    "the matrices @xmath260 and @xmath261 contain the full scattering information and depend on all scatterers not just on @xmath262 and @xmath263 .",
    "note though that the dependence of @xmath42 and @xmath208 is now very explicit .",
    "using in allows us to introduce a single @xmath251 matrix kernel @xmath264 which contains the full scattering information of the medium : @xmath265 where @xmath118 is the characteristic function of all scatterers , while @xmath264 has the structure : @xmath266 where @xmath267 and @xmath268 are continuous on their domain of definition .",
    "these functions play the role of a scattering kernel , and contain the full scattering information of the medium .    when we introduce this formula in we obtain two contributions : one from the `` empty '' space and another one coming from the scatterers .",
    "the same happens with the transfer matrix .",
    "this scattering generated contribution can be expressed as :    @xmath269    where @xmath270 is constructed by introducing the scattering contribution from in which gives : @xmath271 we are now ready to formulate the main result of this section :    [ corollary1 ] the scattering contribution @xmath272 to the transfer matrix element can be expressed as @xmath273 where @xmath274 is a six dimensional vector which can be interpreted as the signal sent by the transmiter in the direction @xmath123 , then @xmath36 is a @xmath275 spread matrix only depending on the scatterers , and finally @xmath276 is a six dimensional vector describing what the receiver got from the direction @xmath120 .    going back to we may assume that : @xmath277 where the @xmath278 s and @xmath53 s are some three dimensional vectors .",
    "then we have : @xmath279 now we integrate with respect to the angles @xmath280 and @xmath281 in .",
    "it is useful to define local spherical coordinates near both the transmitters and the receivers .",
    "introduce @xmath282 and @xmath283 , and @xmath284 and @xmath285 .",
    "now we can define : @xmath286 @xmath287 and @xmath288 then follows immediately .",
    "note that the integrand in the double integral defining the spread matrix @xmath36 is different from zero only on the compact radial supports of the total scatterer defined by the intersection of the scatterer with the direction @xmath123 seen by an observer placed at the origin and by the intersection of the scatterer with the direction @xmath120 seen by an observer placed at @xmath212 .",
    "1 .   starting from the maxwell equations and the ohm s law we give a rigorous analysis of the input - output relationship of a mimo system as a direct , well - posed problem .",
    "the main observation is that we can decouple the group of transmitters from the group of receivers and scatterers if the linear dimensions of all our antennas are small enough , see and the discussion around it . even if this smallness condition would not be satisfied , we could in theory give higher order corrections with respect to the decoupled case .",
    "+ we stress that the transmitting ( receiving ) antennas are allowed to interfere among themselves , so in principle the coupling in between the transmitting ( receiving ) antennas is taken into account .",
    "2 .   in the decoupled case",
    ", we can analyze the transfer matrix and identify in it the spread kernel due to the environment alone .",
    "the most important result of our paper is contained in the equations and ; there we do not need the scatterers to be located in the far - field region of the receiving and transmitting antennas . in the particular case in which the scatterers are far away , then our formulas simplify and",
    "we can recover previously known empirical results derived in @xcite ; in this case , our results are given in - .",
    "+ in a future work we will investigate the behavior of the spread kernel as a function of angles and frequency for scatterers which are not necessarily far away from the emitting and receiving antennas .",
    "3 .   our formalism does not ( yet ) allow ideal metals ( @xmath289 ) or discontinuities in @xmath39 s .",
    "investigating how our formalism behaves when one takes the limit of non - smooth coefficients is a very interesting and difficult problem of operator theory and functional analysis , which will be investigated elsewhere .",
    "we have not elaborated on the question of the limiting absorption principle formulated in ; complete proofs based on the analytic fredholm alternative will be given elsewhere .",
    "we think that our new understanding of the construction of the transfer matrix @xmath1 paves the way for the study of the behavior of the capacity in the case the number of antennas grows in a definite volume ( see @xcite for a discussion on this subject ) .",
    "let us consider an operator @xmath290 where @xmath291 is a `` nice '' elliptic second order reference differential operator ( the typical example is @xmath81 ) , and the perturbations @xmath292 are first order differential operator with smooth coefficients .",
    "the supports of the coefficients of @xmath292 are disjoint from those of the coefficients of @xmath293 if @xmath294 .",
    "denote by @xmath295 the characteristic function of a ball completely containing the support of the coefficients of @xmath296 .",
    "denote by @xmath297 the distance between the supports of @xmath295 and @xmath298 .",
    "denote by @xmath299 and by @xmath300 whenever the two inverses ( resolvents ) exist .",
    "assume @xmath301 .",
    "choose @xmath142 in the resolvent set of @xmath291 .",
    "if the imaginary part of @xmath142 is large enough , then @xmath302 and @xmath114 exists as a bounded operator in @xmath303 .",
    "the second resolvent identity reads as : @xmath304 multiply the above equation with @xmath186 at the left , and write @xmath305 using that @xmath306 we have : @xmath307 where @xmath308 is the identity operator in @xmath309 .",
    "the inverse @xmath310 ( if it exists ) is to be taken in @xmath311 .",
    "we will always assume the existence of this inverse ; generically this is true if @xmath186 is relatively compact to @xmath312 and one can apply the fredholm alternative .    note that if we know @xmath313 , then we know @xmath51 everywhere in the space because we can replace in and obtain : @xmath314      let @xmath315 .",
    "the equivalent of reads as : @xmath316 we multiply with @xmath317 at the left on both sides of the above equality and obtain : @xmath318 denote by @xmath319 .",
    "define the bounded operator @xmath320 given by @xmath321 define the immersion operator @xmath322    denoting the total perturbation by @xmath323 , the equation can be seen as : @xmath324 denote by @xmath325 the identity operator in @xmath326 .",
    "if @xmath327 is invertible in @xmath326 , then the above equation can be rewritten as : @xmath328 moreover , equation can be written as : @xmath329 where in the second line we used .",
    "it follows that the full resolvent can be always written as : @xmath330 where the operators @xmath331 act in @xmath303 .",
    "now let us assume that the distance @xmath297 between any two different supports is large .",
    "we can split the operator @xmath320 in a diagonal and off - diagonal part : @xmath332 clearly , the norm of @xmath333 becomes smaller and smaller when @xmath297 becomes larger .",
    "for example , if @xmath334 we have that @xmath335 .",
