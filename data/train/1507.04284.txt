    "understanding the electronic band structure is at the foundation of solid - state physics .    in practice ,",
    "no potential is perfectly periodic and no refractive index modulation is disorder - free .",
    "therefore , it is important to investigate the impact of disorder on the band structure in electronic systems , optical gratings , and other coherent wave systems  @xcite .",
    "there have been numerous studies of disordered coherent wave systems , much of which follows the seminal work of philip anderson  @xcite .",
    "he showed that for a sufficiently high level of disorder the electronic wavefunction is exponentially attenuated , resulting in diminished transport and conductivity  @xcite , as also confirmed in subsequent work by others  @xcite .",
    "a one - dimensional ( 1d ) periodic bragg grating is simple and elegant ",
    "its band structure is easy to understand and analytical calculations can often be performed to study its characteristics  @xcite . moreover , many of its properties are generic and can be extended to 2d and 3d gratings .",
    "a highly disordered 1d grating made from a random stack of dielectric slabs has also been treated analytically by berry and klein  @xcite .",
    "they showed that the average transmitted intensity drops exponentially with the number of slabs .",
    "the problem of a perfectly periodic bragg grating is well understood , and so is that of a highly disordered grating . the intention of this article is to shed further light on intermediate situations with moderate disorder  @xcite .",
    "we explore the transition from a deterministic periodic bragg grating to a fully random grating , and highlight the gradual emergence of the disorder - related phenomena in intermediate regimes . in particular ,",
    "we present two critical properties of partially disordered 1d bragg gratings . because our analysis is carried out for a stack of dielectric slabs similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , we present these properties in the language of dielectric slabs for simplicity :    _ first _ we find a globally conserved quantity in the reciprocal wavevector space that is quite instrumental in visualizing the wave localization behavior in a partially disordered stack of dielectric slabs .",
    "we show that the total area under the curve of the logarithm of the transmittance plotted in the reciprocal wavevector space is the same for all bragg gratings , regardless of the amount of disorder . as a consequence of this conservation law ,",
    "if the transmittance is higher in some region of the reciprocal space , it has to be lower in another region to conserve the total area .",
    "for example , the presence of a strong bandgap for a periodic bragg grating necessitates a strong bandpass in a different region of the reciprocal space .    _",
    "second _ we observe that for any amount of disorder , the average transmitted intensity decays exponentially with the number of slabs as @xmath0 for sufficiently large @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath2 is a constant whose value depends on the amount of disorder , and @xmath1 is the number of slabs . even in the absence of disorder , the simple exponential decay law holds in the bandgap region for large @xmath1 .",
    "conversely , the simple exponential decay form _ does not _ hold for small @xmath1 except for a highly disordered system .    in the following",
    ", these ideas will be presented in the framework of optical transmission through a 1d stack of dielectric slabs .",
    "the slabs are assumed to be identical with refractive index @xmath3 and are embedded in a background dielectric of refractive index @xmath4 .",

    "averaging , the transmittance curve would look rather noisy but still satisfies the conserved area theorem .",
    "the conserved area theorem provides a very intuitive and useful approach to visualize the impact of partial disorder .",

    "[ eq : bragganalytical ] , the transmittance in the bandpass is a non - decaying oscillatory function of @xmath1 . however , in the bandgap , it is an exponentially decaying function of @xmath1 for large @xmath1 .",

    "the main difference is for the solid black line , which relates to the periodic bragg grating with @xmath27 : @xmath2 oscillates and asymptotically approaches zero as @xmath71 ; therefore , transmittance does not decay exponentially even for large @xmath1 .",
    "this behavior is expected because @xmath70 is at the center of the bandpass for the bragg grating .",
    "when a slight amount of disorder marked by @xmath72 is introduced , the @xmath2-curve ( long - dashed blue ) goes through a brief oscillation and then approaches asymptotically to a nonzero value , indicating that for large @xmath1 the @xmath58 behavior is observed . increasing randomness to @xmath73 increases the scaled decay exponent monotonically . increasing @xmath26 beyond 0.5",
    "initially increases @xmath2 , but eventually rolls it back to make the @xmath2-curve for @xmath74 the same as that of @xmath73 .",
    "the universal exponential decay behavior at large @xmath1 is expected because all 1d disordered systems are anderson localized  @xcite",
    ". however , the converse observation that for small @xmath1 , the transmittance curve can significantly deviate from the simple exponential decay form despite being anderson - localized is worthy of special attention .",
    "the exponential decay is regarded as the main signature for anderson localization and the stated converse observation signifies the importance of asymptotic analysis in establishing anderson localization . in other words , large deviations from an exponential decay in the first few layers do not exclude the possibility of anderson localization .",
    "the transition from a deterministic periodic bragg grating to a fully random grating and the gradual emergence of the disorder - related phenomena in the intermediate regimes is studied in detail .",
    "it is shown that for any amount of disorder the average transmittance decays exponentially with the number of grating layers in the simple form of @xmath0 for sufficiently large @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a constant . for a highly disordered grating",
    ", this simple form is true regardless of the number of mirrors @xmath1 .",
    "conversely , for small @xmath1 , the transmittance curve can deviate from the simple exponential decay form and can even oscillate as it decays . whether increasing the disorder increases or decreases the decay exponent depends on the _ location _ of the grating in the reciprocal wavevector space , the amount of disorder , and other parameters defining the grating .",
    "it is also shown that the integral of the logarithm of the transmittance over the reciprocal wavevector space is a conserved quantity . the randomness in the examples used in this article",
