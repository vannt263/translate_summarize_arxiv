    "in recent years a lot of effort has been devoted to the analysis of rather peculiar phenomenological implications of string inspired cosmological models @xcite .",
    "one of the distinctive features of the low - energy string effective action is indeed the presence of the dilaton field whose sharp growth amplifies , via gravitational instability , not only the scalar and tensor fluctuations of the geometry @xcite but also the ( quantum mechanical ) inhomogeneities associated with other fields which are not part of the homogeneous background like the gauge fields @xcite and the universal axion of string theory @xcite , i.e. the ( four - dimensional ) dual of the kalb - ramond antisymmetric tensor field present in the ( effective ) low energy limit of the action .    the main difference between the amplification of the metric fluctuations and the amplification of other fields with no homogeneous background turned out to be , a posteriori , the spectral amplitudes . in the case of metric fluctuations",
    "the growing modes appearing in the corresponding evolution equations lead typically , to increasing ( `` violet '' ) spectra , whereas in the case of abelian gauge fields and axions the spectral slope can be much milder .",
    "these results refer to the case of a homogeneous background geometry whose spatial section naturally decomposes into the direct product of two ( maximally symmetric ) euclidean sub - manifolds which will be called , for short , _ external _ and _ internal_. this type of metric describes a situation of dimensional decoupling where the external dimensions expand and the internal dimensions contract . in previous studies concerning the phenomenological implications of string inspired scenarios ,",
    "the expanding dimensions have been always taken to be isotropic ( i.e. described by a unique scale factor ) .",
    "similarly , the internal dimensions have been also taken to be isotropic ( this situation can happen if we compactify the internal dimensions on a six - dimensional torus ) .",
    "this choice is not a limitation .",
    "in fact we know that the dilaton `` vacuum '' solutions can be solved for arbitrary ( anisotropic ) manifolds .",
    "there are , a priori , no reasons why the external and/or internal sub - manifolds should be considered , separately , to be isotropic . in the context of the pre - big - bang scenario @xcite the dilaton driven phase starts when the coupling constant and the curvature are quite small but this does not necessarily implies the isotropy of the expanding manifold .",
    "in fact , the study of the occurrence of a dilaton - driven , expanding , regime ( in the string frame ) can be connected to the problem of the gravitational collapse of a stiff ( perfect ) fluid in general relativity .",
    "therefore , as it was recently shown @xcite , an anisotropic dilaton - driven phase can be expected also in four dimensions .",
    "if the four - dimensional metric is _ not _ isotropic different phenomenological consequences can be expected both for the metric inhomogeneities and for the fluctuations of other fields ( like the kalb - ramond axions ) not contributing to the homogeneous background .",
    "concerning the metric perturbations , it is well known that if the four - dimensional geometry is completely anisotropic the scalar , vector and tensor modes of the corresponding fluctuations are all coupled @xcite .",
    "more precisely the tensor modes can still be decoupled from the scalar ones , provided the four - dimensional metric possess some special symmetry @xcite ( like the spherical symmetry , as assumed in @xcite or the cylindrical symmetry as suggested in @xcite ) .",
    "similar problems were addressed not in the framework of the pre - big - bang evolution but in the context of a post - big - bang ( kasner ) behavior of the general relativistic solutions in the vicinity of a cosmological singularity @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will concentrate our attention on the description of mass - less string axions fields in a fully anisotropic four - dimensional metric .",
    "dilaton and graviton production in anisotropic string cosmological models can be studied using techniques similar to the ones we are going to exploit .",
    "there is a simple reason for this choice . in the study of the quantum mechanical inhomogeneities amplified in string",
    "cosmology the scalar and tensor modes of the metric become relevant at large frequencies @xcite ( i.e. small distance scales ) , whereas the axion and gauge perturbations seem to be more important at small frequencies where they can have interesting effects on the cosmic structures .",
    "gauge field fluctuations can have interesting implications in the context of the problem of large scale magnetic fields @xcite and in the context of large scale anisotropies @xcite .",
    "massless ( kalb - ramond ) axions interact only with couplings of gravitational strength and , therefore , their presence is not constrained by present tests of the equivalence principle .",
    "moreover the smallness of the coupling to the anomaly makes their conversion to photons ( in strong magnetic fields ) negligible .",
    "recently it was pointed out that kalb - ramond axions , amplified from vacuum fluctuations , can represent an interesting constraint for pre - big - bang models since they could be invoked for the generation of the cmbr anisotropy in string cosmology @xcite .",
    "the purpose of our investigation is to understand which are the main consequences of treating axionic perturbations in a fully anisotropic four - dimensional metric .",
    "our aim is to show that the evolution of the growing modes of the axionic seeds will be significantly influenced by the breaking of the isotropy with quite unexpected consequences .",
    "indeed in the case of four dimensional ( isotropic ) string cosmological metrics we have that the frequency dependence of the ( logarithmic ) energy spectra associated with the axion is typically `` red '' , i.e. the energy density of axions ( in critical units ) increases at large distances .",
    "this occurrence simply indicates that if we wait long enough time these fluctuations may become dominant ( possibly over - closing the universe ) in the far future .",
    "if we go to the case of ten dimensional exact solutions of the low energy beta functions ( of the type discussed in @xcite ) with four expanding and six contracting dimensions flat spectra of axionic fluctuations are allowed @xcite ( provided the axionic fluctuations along the internal dimensions are frozen ) .",
    "the question we want to address is then the following : _ if we consider the completely anisotropic case are there any indications ( already in four dimension ) for different spectral behaviors ? _ in this sense our investigation complements and extends previous studies on the subject .",
    "if the dilaton driven phase is followed by a radiation dominated phase it is possible to compute the logarithmic energy spectrum according to the standard techniques developed in the case of metric and gauge fluctuations @xcite with the result that the axion energy density @xmath11 will be given , in critical units , as @xmath12^ { 3 - 2 \\mu } \\label{1.3}\\ ] ] ( @xmath13 is the physical momentum ; @xmath14 is the maximal amplified frequency ; @xmath15 is the value of the coupling constant at the moment of the transition from the dilaton - driven phase to the radiation dominated phase , and @xmath16 is the critical fraction of energy density stored in radiation at a given time @xmath2 ) . from eq .",
    "( [ 1.3 ] ) we see that if @xmath6 , as implied by the background ( [ 1.1 ] ) , the spectral slope in eq .",
    "( [ 1.3 ] ) is @xmath17 , namely the logarithmic energy spectrum is decreasing in frequency .",
    "usually these type of spectra are called red simply because the largest power is stored at large distance scales .",
    "if one wants to use axionic seeds for the explanation of large scale ( temperature ) fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) red spectra do not seem ideal @xcite since one would need either flat or `` blue '' spectra ( i.e. @xmath18 ) . as noted in @xcite by adding six ( internal ) contracting dimensions and by assuming that axion fluctuations do not propagate along the internal dimensions , it is possible to achieve @xmath19 . in this case",
    "the scale factors of the external , @xmath20-dimensional ( expanding ) and internal , @xmath21-dimensional ( contracting ) manifolds will evolve , respectively as @xmath22 and @xmath23 while the dilaton is constant @xcite . this kind of background could also be dynamically justified not only in terms of vacuum solutions but also in terms of a string driven dynamics where the ( vacuum ) background equations are supplemented by ( effective ) string sources with negative pressure @xcite .",
    "are the conclusions of the present analysis valid in the case of a _ completely anisotropic four - dimensional metric _ ?",
    "this is the main point we would like to investigate .",
    "thus , we should study which is the evolution of the ( super - horizon ) axion fluctuations when we drop the assumption of isotropy for the four dimensional metric .",
    "we will also have to compute precisely the spectral energy density when the axionic inhomogeneities , amplified during the anisotropic ( dilaton - driven ) phase , re - enter during an isotropic radiation dominated phase .    the plan of our paper in then the following . in section",
    "ii we will review the basic equations describing the dynamics of anisotropic dilaton - driven phases .",
    "we will also set up the main evolution equations of the axionic mode functions . in section iii",
    "we will study the evolution of axionic perturbations in the anisotropic models and we will show , in some analytic examples , how blue energy spectra appear . in section iv we will concentrate our attention on numerical solutions . finally in section v we will study the influence of string tension corrections on our picture paying special attention to the class of models leading to blue axion ( logarithmic ) energy spectra .",

    "this restriction is not essential and all the results discussed in the present paper can be extended to the case of @xmath29 . at the same time we find this simplification useful for the physical intuition .",
    "notice , moreover , that if @xmath30 the tensor modes of the geometry propagating along the @xmath31 axis can be decoupled from the scalar modes ( this is not the case if @xmath29 ) @xcite .",

    "the result is reported in fig .",
    "the arc of the ellipse bounded by the two ( full ) thick lines correspond to ( anisotropic ) vacuum solutions leading to growing modes compatible with `` blue '' spectra .",
    "the intersections between the two full lines and the ellipse correspond to the case @xmath78 ( flat spectrum ) . of course",
    "not all the models within the full lines are realistic .    for examples we could have , in principle , growing spectra with @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( first quadrant ) .",

    "it is quite amusing to work out the einstein frame description of this solution .",
    "the einstein frame scale factors are related to the ones of the string frame by trivial conformal rescalings involving the dilaton , namely @xmath93 since the conformal time coordinate does not change passing from one frame to the other ( i.e. @xmath94 we can obtain easily that , in the einstein frame , our solution looks like @xmath95 and @xmath96 ( since @xmath97 is constant @xmath36 and @xmath2 coincide up to a constant factor ) .",
    "it is interesting to point out that this solution was kasner - like in the string frame ( i.e. @xmath98 ) and it becomes true kasner in the einstein frame .",
    "this solution is well known in the theory of the gravitational collapse @xcite and it might be thought as the limit ( in the vicinity of the singularity ) of a spherically symmetric space filled with a stiff ( perfect ) fluid .",

    "thus also in the fully anisotropic case the spectral distribution of the amplified axions is determined by the solution of the mode equation in the small @xmath2 limit .",
    "furthermore , on the basis of the analytical treatment performed in the present section we can argue that as long as @xmath141 in eq . ( [ can3 ] ) , the spectral slope of the spectral energy density @xmath142 is completely determined by the `` angular momentum '' term appearing in eq .",

    "<S> we show that this conclusion can be evaded not only in the case of higher dimensional backgrounds with contracting internal dimensions but also in the case of string cosmological scenarios which are _ completely anisotropic in four dimensions_. in this case the logarithmic energy spectra turn out to be  blue \" in frequency and , consequently , _ decreasing _ at large distance scales . </S>",
    "<S> we elaborate on anisotropic dilaton - driven models and we argue that , incidentally , the background models leading to ( or flat ) logarithmic energy spectra for axionic fluctuations are likely to be isotropized by the effect of string tension corrections .    </S>",
