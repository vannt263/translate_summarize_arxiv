    "we let @xmath10 denote the cell in @xmath6-th row from the bottom and @xmath11-th column from the left of the @xmath1 rectangle and we let @xmath12 denote the element in cell @xmath10 of @xmath13 . for example",

    "it is easy to see that latexmath:[\\[\\label{number }    @xmath5 , allowing all permutations of the elements in each column gives rise to @xmath16 fillings of the @xmath1 rectangle with the numbers @xmath2 . since there are @xmath17 fillings of the @xmath1 rectangle with the numbers @xmath2 , ( [ number ] ) easily follows .    given a partition @xmath18 where @xmath19 , we let @xmath20 denote the ferrers diagram of @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath20 is the set of left - justified rows of squares where the size of the @xmath6-th row , reading from top to bottom , is @xmath22 .",
    "thus a @xmath1 rectangular array corresponds to the ferrers diagram corresponding to @xmath23 . if @xmath5 and the integers are increasing in each row , reading from left to right , then @xmath7 is a standard tableau of shape @xmath23 .",

    "the goal of this paper is to study pattern matching conditions in @xmath0 .",
    "clearly , when @xmath30 , we have @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the symmetric group , so our results can be viewed as generalizations of results on pattern matching in @xmath32 .",
    "our long term goal is to extend the work of this paper to the study pattern matching conditions in standard tableaux of rectangular shape as well as pattern matching conditions in column strict tableaux of rectangular shapes over a fixed alphabet @xmath33 .",
    "the study of pattern matching conditions in @xmath0 is considerably easier than the study of pattern matching conditions in standard tableaux or column strict tableax .",
    "nevertheless , we shall see that the study of pattern matching conditions in @xmath0 requires us to prove some interesting results on pattern matching conditions in standard tableaux .",
    "in particular , we shall generalize two classical results on permutations . given a permutation @xmath34 ,",
    "we let @xmath35 we let @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "then the generating function for the distribution of rises or descents in @xmath32 is given by @xmath38 see stanley @xcite .",

    "let @xmath43 denote the number of alternating permutations of @xmath32 .",
    "then andr @xcite , @xcite proved that @xmath44 and @xmath45    if @xmath7 is any filling of a @xmath1-rectangle with distinct positive integers such that elements in each column increase , reading from bottom to top , then we let @xmath46 denote the element of @xmath0 which results from @xmath7 by replacing the @xmath6-th smallest element of @xmath7 by @xmath6 . for example , figure [ figure : red ] demonstrates a filling , @xmath7 , with its corresponding reduced filling , @xmath46 .    if @xmath5 and @xmath47 , then we let @xmath48 $ ] be the filling of the @xmath49 rectangle where the elements in column @xmath50 of @xmath48 $ ] equal the elements in column @xmath51 in @xmath7 for @xmath52",

    "again , when @xmath30 , then @xmath58 , where @xmath32 is the symmetric group , and our definitions reduce to the standard definitions that have appeared in the pattern matching literature .",
    "we note that kitaev , mansour , and vella @xcite have studied pattern matching in matrices which is a more general setting than the one we are considering in this paper .",
    "we let @xmath59 denote the number of @xmath3-matches in @xmath7 and let @xmath60 be the maximum number of nonoverlapping @xmath3-matches in @xmath7 , where two @xmath3-matches are said to overlap if they share a common column .",

    ", we must have the situation pictured in figure [ figure : deg1 ] .",
    "that is , because @xmath3 is a column strict tableau , arrows that go from column 1 to column 2 can not cross each other .",
    "hence all the cells of the form @xmath608 where @xmath682 must have been hit by vertical arrows . but",
    "this is impossible because then @xmath683 would be a set of consecutive elements so it would be impossible to have @xmath680 , as is required for @xmath3 to be a column strict tableau .    since we know",
    "that @xmath684 , to prove that @xmath291 is bijection , we need only show that @xmath291 is 1:1 .",
    "let @xmath685 and @xmath686 be two distinct column strict tableaux of shape @xmath648 .",
    "let @xmath627 be the largest element such that @xmath687 are in the same cells in both @xmath685 and @xmath686 and suppose that @xmath627 is in cell @xmath688 .",
    "then without loss of generality , we can assume that @xmath689 is in column 1 in @xmath685 and in column 2 in @xmath686 .",
    "but this means that the arrow out of @xmath688 goes to column 1 in @xmath690 and to column 2 in @xmath691 , which implies that the @xmath6-th step in @xmath692 is not equal to the @xmath6-th step in @xmath693 , so @xmath694 .",

    "we end this section with a few remarks about how we have derived formulas for @xmath155 for certain column strict tableaux @xmath3 .",
