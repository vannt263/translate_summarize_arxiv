    "percolation  @xcite is one of the best studied problems in statistical physics , both because of its fundamental nature and its vast array of applications .",
    "the most natural type of percolation , perhaps , is continuum percolation , where the positions of the constituting elements are not restricted to the discrete sites or bonds of a regular lattice .",
    "a simple example of continuum percolation is a conducting material with uniformly - sized holes placed at random . due to its similarity to swiss cheese , this model is commonly called the swiss - cheese model .",
    "since the holes are allowed to overlap , the system ceases to support electrical transport when the total volume of the holes exceeds a critical fraction @xmath7 . near this percolation threshold @xmath7",
    "the conducting network consists of many narrow bottlenecks each of which is bounded by inter - penetrating holes .",
    "thus , it is plausible that the swiss - cheese model can be mapped onto the random resistor network ( rrn ) problem where conducting nearest neighbor bonds on a hyper - cubic @xmath4-dimensional lattice are randomly occupied with a probability @xmath8 .",
    "apparently , the bottlenecks are playing a role similar to the occupied conducting bonds .",
    "however , the bottlenecks have a wide distribution of widths , in contrast to the standard rrn , where all occupied bonds are identical . due to the wide distribution of neck - widths",
    "the swiss - cheese model corresponds to a modified rrn in which the conductances @xmath0 of the individual occupied bonds have a broad distribution in the form of a power law @xmath1 with @xmath9  . due to its relation to the swiss - cheese model , we abbreviate such a rrn by @xmath10 .",
    "it is well established that the purely geometrical percolation exponents for the swiss - cheese model are in conformity with their analogs in the discrete models  .",
    "for example , the correlation length @xmath11 is governed in both models by the same exponent @xmath5 .",
    "the reason is that only the connectivity of the bottlenecks is relevant for the geometrical exponents .",
    "as the widths of the individual bottlenecks do not matter , they can be regarded identical in the context of connectivity properties and the problem is essentially equivalent to standard discrete percolation .",
    "the situation is different for critical exponents pertaining to transport quantities .",
    "let us consider the conductivity exponent @xmath12 for the rrn .",
    "it describes the decrease of the average macroscopic conductivity @xmath13 when the critical occupation probability @xmath14 is approached from above  @xcite @xmath15 the conductivity exponent is related to the resistance exponent @xmath6 governing the average resistance @xmath16 between two terminal sites @xmath17 and @xmath18 known to be on the same cluster  @xcite @xmath19 via the scaling relation @xmath20 the conductivity exponent for the @xmath21on the other hand depends on a , i.e. , @xmath22 early estimates of @xmath23 were given by kogut and straley  @xcite , and ben - mizrahi and bergman  @xcite .",
