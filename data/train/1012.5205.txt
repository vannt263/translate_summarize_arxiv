    "the dynamics of suspended particles whose size is larger than the smallest active scales of the carrier turbulent flow is important for the understanding of many natural and industrial applications . let us mention two concrete problems borrowed from the study of planet formation and of rain processes . in the first situation ,",
    "the role of turbulence is still unsettled in the dynamical mechanisms that take place during the origination of planets in a proto - planetary disk ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a key issue is to understand whether or not the disk turbulence can generate an increase of the rate at which a large body can accrete dust .",
    "in other terms , it requires identifying the turbulent fluctuation mechanisms that lead to a snowball effect where the larger bodies have a growth speed all the more fast as their size increases .",
    "the same kind of question arises in the precipitation process when a large raindrop falls under the effect of gravity and collides with much smaller droplets that are transported by the turbulent airflow in the cloud ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for this problem",
    ", another question is to know the efficiency of wet deposition ( or scavenging ) of particle pollutants that are present in the atmosphere ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these various phenomena are still poorly understood and are subject to empirical ad - hoc modeling .",
    "such fundamental open questions , which are taken from natural sciences but also arise in a number of industrial settings , reflect an inadequate current level of modeling for large particles in turbulent flows .",
    "current approaches for the dynamics of finite - size particles are commonly assuming that the particles are infinitely small ( point particles ) and that the reynolds number associated to their interaction with the flow vanishes , so that their dynamics can be obtained by matching the solution to the stokes equation in their vicinity to an unperturbed fluid velocity .",
    "recent experimental work showed that the dynamics of finite - size particles is not well described by such models ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "significant size effects have been for instance measured in the acceleration statistics of such particles . despite the fact that the flatness of the acceleration distribution depends only weakly on the diameter of the particle , its variance strongly decreases with diameter and temporal correlations of the acceleration vary with the particle size in a manner that can not be predicted by standard point - particle models .",
    "improved models accounting for the so - called `` faxn corrections '' ( spatial averages of fluid velocities and accelerations over the volume of the particle ) are in much better agreement with such qualitative trends but hardly reproduce quantitatively the mentioned experimental data ( see * ? ? ?",
    "one of the most challenging requirement for improving such models is to get a precise understanding on how the carrier flow is modified in the vicinity of the particle in situations where such effects occurs on scales which are comparable to the active scales of the surrounding turbulence .",
    "for instance , it is clear that much work is still needed in order to get a better handling on how the kinetic turbulent energy , the dissipation rate , as well as other standard statistical properties of turbulence , varies in the turbulent boundary layer enclosing the particle .",
    "direct numerical simulations appear to be valuable candidates as they give a unique global and instantaneous access to such quantities .",
    "however , the numerical problem is challenging for several reasons : _",
    "( i ) _ the numerical approach has to resolve all active scales of a fully developed turbulent flow , which span several decades ; _ ( ii ) _ at small scales the boundary layer around the particle is of great importance and has to be well resolved ; _ ( iii ) _ if one considers a moving particle the algorithm has to follow the displacement of the particle accurately and efficiently ; _ ( iv ) _ for a sufficient separation of the different scales involved ( forcing scales , inertial range of scales , dissipative scales ) the algorithm has to parallelize efficiently on massively parallel computers .    two different strategies have been recently proposed in order to solve the incompressible navier ",
    "stokes equations together with no - slip boundary conditions at the surface of a spherical particle . both make use of a homogeneous grid covering of the complete physical domain .",
    "the first,``physalis '' , which was developed by @xcite and extended and used by @xcite , makes use of known analytic solutions to the stokes equation for the boundary layer in the vicinity of the particle , in order to describe the velocity at the nearest surface points of the grid .",
    "iteratively , the analytic solution and the solution on the homogeneous grid are matched .",
    "an advantage of this strategy is that the no - slip condition is imposed in an exact manner .",
    "however , improvement are required in order to achieve very - large reynolds number carrier flows ( the value @xmath1 of the taylor - microscale reynolds number was chosen in * ? ? ?",
    "the other recently developed approach consists in using and matching two different grids .",
    "a spherical one encloses the particle surface and is designed to resolve the boundary layer and a second homogeneous grid covers the entire domain .",
    "this `` overset grid '' technique proposed by @xcite uses a third - order interpolation to transfer values from one grid to the other in order to couple the two solutions .",
    "this method was shown to reproduce very accurately experimental measurements of the drag coefficient at a particle reynolds number of @xmath2 .",
    "in turbulent settings , this method was used with a reynolds number @xmath3 .",
    "both of these methods reside on finite - difference schemes and are at the moment limited to rather small carrier - flow reynolds numbers .",
    "we propose here a new method that allows one to reach much higher reynolds numbers .",
    "the idea is to combine a standard pseudo - fourier - spectral with a penalty method .",
    "the former is well adapted to incompressible homogeneous and isotropic turbulence and has been extensively used in such settings during the past .",
    "its advantages comprise its degree of accuracy and its performance on massive parallel supercomputers such as the bluegene / p system or large intel / amd clusters . in combination with an immersed boundary and penalization strategy , high reynolds numbers turbulent flow with an extended inertial range of scales can be reached .",
    "the proposed method is a modification of that used by @xcite for investigating the dynamics of neutrally buoyant particles suspended in turbulent flows .",
    "the former version of the method was well - adapted to particles displaying a small slip velocity with respect to the fluid but happened to show some limitations when the slip is too large .",
    "we present here a modification of this method that unravels such shortcomings .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : method ] we present in details the proposed method , together with some considerations concerning its convergence .",
    "section  [ sec : benchmarks ] presents measurements of drag and lift coefficients in various settings and compare them to other numerical and experimental works .",
    "we consider the cases of a stationary sphere in a flow at a constant speed , of a freely rotating sphere and a translating sphere in a flow maintained at rest .",
    "section  [ sec : wake ] deals with the characterization of the turbulence decay in the particle wake .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] encompasses concluding remarks and open questions .",
    "the dynamics of an incompressible flow in which is embedded a particle is given by the navier - stokes equations @xmath4 together with the no - slip boundary condition on the surface of the particle @xmath5 @xmath6 denotes here external forces that are exerted on the flow , @xmath7 is the full physical domain containing both the fluid and the particle , @xmath8 is the boundary of the physical location @xmath9 of the particle at time @xmath10 , and @xmath11 denotes the velocity of the particle surface .",
    "note that in the case of a solid spherical particle with diameter @xmath12 , one has @xmath13 and @xmath14 \\times \\bm\\omega_p(t)$ ] , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the translational and angular velocities of the particle , respectively .",
    "the particle motion is then obtained by solving newton equations where the force exerted by the fluid is obtained by integrating on the surface of the particle the contribution from pressure and viscous stress to the fluid stress tensor .    the numerical method presented here",
    "consists in integrating the navier  stokes equation ( [ eq : navier - stokes ] ) by using a strongly - stable , low - storage runge - kutta scheme of third order that was introduced by @xcite .",
    "it reads @xmath17 @xmath18 denotes here the time step and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the velocity fields at time steps @xmath21 and @xmath22 and the operator @xmath23 denotes the right - hand side ( rhs ) of ( [ eq : navier - stokes ] ) .",
    "the later is integrated on a homogeneous rectangular periodic spatial grid with a fourier pseudo - spectral solver using the standard 2/3 rule to avoid aliasing due to its quadratic nonlinearity ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the pressure term is obtained by solving the poisson equation @xmath24 directly in fourier space .",
    "the viscous term is treated implicitly via an exponential factor .    to impose the no - slip boundary conditions ( [ eq : bc ] ) at the surface of the particle , we make use of an immersed boundary technique .",
    "it consists in introducing in the right - hand side of the navier - stokes equation ( [ eq : navier - stokes ] ) a penalty force @xmath25 , which acts as a lagrange multiplier associated to the constraint defined by the boundary condition ( [ eq : bc ] ) .",
    "the full problem ( [ eq : navier - stokes])-([eq : bc ] ) can then be rewritten as @xmath26 this system then has to be associated with the problem @xmath27 one can easily see that , when the solution is approximated by the galerkin truncation associated with the fourier spectral method , these two conditions can not be satisfied in an exact manner : an non - zero function that vanishes on a full sub - domain is necessarily non - analytic and can not be represented by a finite number of fourier modes .",
    "the idea of the method which is used here is to relax the problem of finding the penalty force @xmath28 to @xmath29 all the difficulty of integrating this system is now in finding an efficient manner of solving the optimization problem above , which involves local condition in the physical space , while spectral methods try to be as local as possible in fourier space .",
    "as this has to be done at every sub - time steps , the use of standard minimization techniques would introduce a very large number of operations and result in a cost - inefficient algorithm .",
    "efficient strategies consist in guessing acceptable values of the field @xmath28 .",
    "we here make use of the `` direct - forcing '' method proposed by @xcite . to explain this method ,",
    "let us consider a simple euler - discretization in time of ( [ eq : ib ] ) @xmath30.\\ ] ] the idea of the direct - forcing method is to use the fact that we want to impose @xmath31 in @xmath32 to write from ( [ eq : euler ] ) @xmath33,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 denotes the characteristic function of the particle : @xmath35 if @xmath36 and 0 otherwise .",
    "other similar approaches consist in imposing the boundary conditions by means of a darcy term , i.e. @xmath37 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the particle volume is then seen as a porous media where a large value of the parameter @xmath38 ensures the no - slip boundary conditions but results in choosing a sufficiently small value of the time step .",
    "the advantage of direct forcing is that it consists in combining the value of the parameter @xmath38 that is optimal for a given choice of the time step @xmath39 , together with a compensation of the overall evolution of the velocity field inside the particle due to @xmath23",
    ".      the expression ( [ eq : directforcing ] ) for @xmath40 would be correct if the position of the grid points coincided with the immersed boundary .",
    "this is not true in the case of a spherical particle embedded in a cubic grid .",
    "an interpolation procedure is then needed in order to prescribe the boundary conditions at the grid - points next to the surface . for this",
    "we use a volume - fraction scheme proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the characteristic function @xmath41 describing the geometry of the particle is averaged over two grid cell : @xmath42 this representation has two advantages .",
    "first , as a typical velocity field around a particle is continuous but not differentiable at the surface , gibbs oscillations are created in the vicinity of the boundary ; replacing the characteristic function by @xmath43 reduces such oscillations .",
    "second , this volume averaged @xmath43 allows for a continuous displacement of the immersed boundary which is important in the case of a moving particle .",
    "another issue arises when combining a spectral with a penalty method .",
    "although applying the force @xmath40 to the velocity field imposes the boundary conditions precisely , the divergence - freeness of @xmath44 requires a subsequent projection of the velocity field onto its solenoidal part which violates the formally correct boundary conditions .",
    "a solution to this conflict is to solve the poisson equation ( [ eq : pressure - poisson ] ) for pressure with modified boundary conditions as for example proposed by @xcite in combination with a finite - difference scheme .",
    "however , this is not possible with a fourier - spectral method as in this case ( [ eq : pressure - poisson ] ) is solved with generic periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we attenuate this intrinsic problem of a fourier - spectral approach by using a predictor for the pressure gradient in ( [ eq : ib ] ) , as considered by @xcite .",
    "we will now explain our procedure .",
    "the usual strategy in spectral codes without immersed boundaries consists in advancing first the velocity without taking into account the pressure gradient in ( [ eq : navier - stokes ] ) @xmath45.\\ ] ] the intermediate velocity field @xmath46 is compressible and is projected in a second step onto its solenoidal part @xmath47 this projection is equivalent to subtracting the gradient of the pressure that is given by the poisson equation ( [ eq : pressure - poisson ] ) .",
    "this splitting of the integration is called fractional - step method .",
    "if the domain contains immersed boundaries with no - slip conditions , the penalty force @xmath28 has to be additionally applied .",
    "this can be seen as an intermediate step @xmath48 leading to a compressible @xmath49 , which is again projected onto its solenoidal part as in ( [ eq : discproj ] ) .",
    "a problem arises since the two operators @xmath50 and @xmath51 do not commute .",
    "the application of @xmath50 spoils the result of @xmath51 .",
    "our approach consists in attenuating this conflict by adding a predictor for the pressure gradient to ( [ eq : discnav1 ] ) .",
    "we make of @xmath52 , i.e. of the value of the pressure gradient at the last time step .",
    "this predictor already includes the major part of the pressure needed to keep the velocity field very close to being divergence - free .",
    "the predictor is updated during the projection step according to @xmath53 it is important to stress that we apply the operators p and b and also the update of the pressure predictor during each sub - time step of the third - order temporal scheme ( [ eq : rk3 ] ) .    the importance of the predictor for a fourier - spectral scheme is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : predictor_comp ] where the streamwise velocity profile on a line passing through the particle is shown .",
    "the flow conditions correspond to a numerical wind tunnel experiment where a fixed spherical particle ( @xmath54 ) is embedded in a homogeneous flow .",
    "the velocity fluctuations introduced by the wake of the particle are eliminated in a zone at the right boundary by an additional application of the penalty method .",
    "the accuracy of the upstream boundary condition at the particle surface is strongly affected by the pressure predictor . with the predictor",
    "we achieve a no - slip condition at the surface while the fluid significantly enters the particle when we neglect the pressure predictor .",

    "we have seen above that the self - similar wake approach reproduces well the decay @xmath146 of the mean velocity deficit . however , this approach can not be fully true as no similarity is observed in the wake . in order to get a better handling , we relate in this section this observed behavior to the decay of turbulent kinetic energy in the wake of the spherical particle .",
    "it is known since the seminal work of @xcite that the law of decay of turbulent kinetic energy is dictated by the `` principle of permanence of large eddies '' .",
    "we follow here the phenomenological presentation of this law made by @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the initial turbulent velocity correlations follow a infrared asymptotic self - similarity of the form @xmath147 at large scales @xmath148 , the decay behavior of all turbulent quantities is dictated by the value of the exponent @xmath149 .",
    "indeed , by continuity of velocity statistics , the integral - scale velocity should then itself behave as @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the turbulent kinetic energy and @xmath152 is the integral scale .",
    "however , we know that the energy decays with a rate that can be related to velocity by @xmath153 . replacing @xmath151 by @xmath154 in this equation , we obtain that @xmath155 , so that @xmath156 .",
    "this evolution of the integral scale implies that the kinetic turbulent energy behave as @xmath157 .    when considering the decay of wake turbulence ,",
    "all the turbulent quantities have to be of course evaluated in planes perpendicular to the axisymmetric axis and time has to be replaced by @xmath158 by invoking taylor hypothesis .",
    "the above considerations hence imply that if the velocity correlations @xmath159 behave as @xmath160 in a plane @xmath161 located in the developing wake , then at any @xmath162 , the large - scale correlations should remember this initial form and the turbulent kinetic energy is expected to decay as @xmath163 .",

    "such a fast decay of the correlations is associated in the above phenomenological formalism to a value of the exponent @xmath165 ( an exponential is faster than any power law ) , leading to a decay of the turbulent kinetic energy @xmath166 .",

    "the mean velocity deficit @xmath170 approximatively obeys the equation @xmath171 @xmath101 denotes here the reynolds tensor introduced in previous subsections .",

    "simulations that were performed with this method in the case of a spherical particle embedded in a homogeneous flow , show that such a strategy reproduces with a high accuracy known results on the variation of the drag and lift forces as a function of the particle reynolds number and give a precise handling on the turbulent fluctuations that arise in the wake downstream the sphere .",
    "such benchmarking will now allow us confidently attacking the physical problems that motivated the development of such a code .",
    "the first question that is subject to ongoing work concerns the dynamics of neutrally buoyant finite - size particles that are transported by a developed turbulent flow in the case when the diameter of such particles falls inside the turbulent inertial range of lengthscales .",
    "the drag , lift , slip velocity associated to such settings are still not well defined because of the fluctuating nature of the fluid surrounding environment .",
    "this situation still requires an important modeling effort and a first step consists in understanding how the fluid velocity statistical properties are modified by the presence of the particle .",
    "preliminary results confirm that a turbulent boundary layer develops around the particle and that its thickness is comparable to the particle size .",
    "an important open question that is worth mentioning here relates to possible improvements of the order of the method that is presented here .",
    "as we have seen , the error of the proposed method is of the order of @xmath172 . to go beyond this first order ,",

    "[ sec : method ] and which consists in expressing the penalty force as a solution to a minimization problem . to avoid gibbs oscillations that , as we showed , are responsible for the observed error , it could be envisaged to relax such minimality to the surface instead of the full particle volume , allowing for instance the fluid flow to develop inside the particle , without affecting the no - slip boundary condition .",
