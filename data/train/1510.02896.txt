    "this contradicts the fact that @xmath499 is simply - connected .",
    "now by applying brikhoff curve - shortening process we obtain a closed geodesic in @xmath1 of length at most @xmath6 proving corollary [ systolic ] for the case when @xmath513 .    if @xmath1 is homeomorphic to a 3-sphere then by the min - max argument described in @xcite existence of a sweepout , which is continuous in @xmath209 by short 1-cycles implies existence of a geodesic net with the desired length bound .",
    "the first open question is the relation between the almgren - pitts min - max minimal surface and the simon - smith ( also colding - de lellis ) min - max minimal surface in @xmath514 with positive ricci curvature ( or even in any 3-manifold with positive ricci curvature ) . the almgren - pitts minimal surface , which we use in this paper , has area bounded by the @xmath515-power of the volume up to a universal constant , and genus @xmath2 ; while the simon - smith min - max minimal surface has genus @xmath26 ( heegaard genus for @xmath516 ) but no a priori area bound in terms of the volume of the ambient manifold .",
    "it is then a natural question to compare them .",
    "the second open question is whether we could have diameter bound for the whole min - max family constructed in theorem [ main theorem3 ] when we assume the scalar curvature lower bound instead of just getting a diameter bound for the min - max surface as in theorem [ main theorem3.1 ] .",
    "these two questions are related to the problem of finding an upper bound for the length of the shortest non - trivial closed geodesic in manifold @xmath514 .",
    "the methods of this paper produce a sweepout of @xmath514 by short 1-cycles which yields a stationary geodesic net in @xmath514 of controlled length , but they do not give any bound for the length of the shortest closed geodesic .",
    "for this purpose one would need to consider sweepouts by loops instead of 1-cycles .",
    "if a manifold @xmath514 admits a sweepout by 2-spheres or 2-tori of controlled area @xmath95 and diameter @xmath517 then it seems plausible that using methods of @xcite one could bound the length of the shortest closed geodesic in @xmath514 in terms of @xmath95 and @xmath517 .",
