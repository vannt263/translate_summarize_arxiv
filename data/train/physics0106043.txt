    "the physical motivation of the present paper is a growing interest in the exciton transfer in the antenna systems ( ass ) of the purple bacteria photosynthetic units ( psus ) .",
    "the light - harvesting complexes that are present in photosynthetic systems perform two major functions : harvest ( absorb ) the incident light and transport the energy in form of frenkel excitons to the reaction center ( rc ) .",
    "many investigations , both experimental and theoretical ones , have been directed towards understanding of the exciton transfer in the ass of purple bacteria psus and are reviewed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "although considerable progress has been made during recent years , our knowledge about the mechanism of energy transfer and relaxation is still far from complete .    in 1995",
    "the first high - resolution three - dimensional x - ray structure of a bacterial antenna complex lh2 from _ rhodopseudomonas acidophila _ was published by mc dermott et al .",
    "@xcite . it consists ( see fig . 2 in @xcite ) of nine identical units , protomers ,",
    "each of which is formed by two proteins ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) with bound bacteriochlorophyls ( bchl ) .",
    "the nine @xmath0 subunits are packed in an inner ring to form a hollow cylinder of radius 1.8 nm .",
    "the 9 @xmath1 subunits are arranged radially outwards with respect to the @xmath0 subunits to form another ring with a radius of 3.4 nm .",
    "the protein serves as a scaffold for the bchls and furthermore specifically influences the spectroscopic properties of the bchls by supplying a characteristic environment for them .",
    "a ring with a radius of about 2.5 nm of 18 bchl molecules is sandwiched between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 subunits .",
    "the very symmetric arrangement with short distances between the pigments provides a new impulse to the discussion about , e.g. , the exciton transfer regime and the exciton delocalization in lh2 . the extent of the exciton delocalization , which could be reduced by dynamic and static disorders , has been discussed .",
    "the principal question reads : are the states contributing to the optical and transport properties of the lh2 ring localized or delocalized ?    in the past knowledge of the energy transfer was mainly derived from steady state spectroscopic experiments leading to several absorption bands at different wavelengths .",
    "pigment molecules b850 , that we are dealing with , are characterized by the absorption wavelength in the lh2 subunits of the ass of purple bacteria . at room temperature",
    "the solvent and the protein environment fluctuate with characteristic time scales ranging from femtoseconds to nanoseconds .",
    "the dynamical aspects of the system are reflected in the line shapes of the electronic transitions . to fully characterize the line shape of a transition and thereby the dynamics of the system",
    ", one needs to know not only the fluctuation amplitude @xmath2 ( coupling strength ) but also the time scale of each process involved .",
    "the observed linewidths reflect the combined influence of static disorder and exciton coupling to intermolecular , intramolecular , and solvent nuclear motions .",
    "the simplest approach is to decompose the line profile into homogeneous and inhomogeneous contributions . in more sophisticated models ,",
    "each process is defined with its characteristic time scale as well as a coupling strength @xcite .    both the exciton - phonon coupling and the static disorder lead to localization of excitons .",
    "one tries to avoid the influence either of the dynamical disorder by measuring at very low temperatures or of the static disorder by performing single - molecule spectroscopy experiments .",
    "the absorption , circular dichroism , and hole - burning spectra of the lh2 complex are reproduced reasonably well by theoretical treatments , that consider frenkel exciton states of the entire complex but invoke moderate disorder in the excitation energies of the individual bchls @xcite .    in a homogeneous system ,",
    "in which the @xmath3 transition dipole moments of the b850 bchls all lie approximately in the plane of the ring , most of the dipole strength of the b850 band would come from a degenerate pair of orthogonally polarized transitions at an energy slightly higher than the transition energy of the lowest exciton state .",
    "however , energetic or structural disorder that disrupts the symmetry of the complex will make both the low - energy transition and transitions at higher energies weakly allowed .",
    "time - dependent experiments ( absorption , fluorescence , photon echo , etc . ) , which used ( sub-)picosecond light pulses of low energy with high repetition rate tunable through the infrared absorption bands of the various bchl pigments in a variety of bacterial ass , made it possible to study the long - time as well as femtosecond dynamics of the energy transfer and relaxation @xcite .",
    "the nature of the rapid relaxation is of interest because it depends on how photosynthetic antenna complexes absorb and transfer energy and because it may provide an experimental window to protein dynamics on very short time scales @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of time - dependent experiments on femtosecond time scale requires a theory which incorporates both dynamic disorder and different kinds of static disorder .",
    "recently , models based on extended exciton states with moderate static disorder @xmath4 have found acceptance in the interpretation of the experiments @xcite in which it has been shown that the elementary dynamics occurs on a time scale of about 100 fs @xcite .",
    "for the ring of bchls in the lh2 antenna complex kumble and hochstrasser @xcite has presented a time - domain analysis of the effects of local energy inhomogeneity upon the dynamics of optical excitations .",
    "they examined the manifestation of disorder scattering in polarized femtosecond spectroscopy and the degree to which exciton delocalization is revealed in emission and transient absorption anisotropy measurements .",
    "the time evolution of the quantum states , prepared by impulsive excitation of a statically disordered circular aggregate model for lh2 antenna complexes , have been calculated exactly quantum mechanically for varying degrees of inhomogeneity ( static disorder ) , but without taking into account the interaction with a heat bath ( dynamic disorder ) . for a gaussian distribution of local energies",
    ", the dynamics of coherence loss ( scattering ) has been explored as a function of the ratio of the standard deviation @xmath5 of the distribution to the intersite interaction energy @xmath6 .",
    "( please note that kumble and hochstrasser used the symbol @xmath7 for the standard deviation in their paper @xcite . )",
    "it has been found , that modest degrees of disorder ( @xmath8 ) are sufficient to cause scattering on a sub-100 fs time scale .",
    "the estimate of static disorder emerging from this investigation should be considered as an upper limit . by neglecting the influence of phonons , kumble and hochstrasser s model",
    "does not take into account the dynamic scattering effects which contribute to dephasing of the initial wave packet state and which promote thermalization of the dephased populations .",
    "nagarjan et al.@xcite measured the changes in absorption and stimulated emission caused by excitation with 35 fs pulses centered at 875 nm . substantial relaxation on the time scale of 10 - 100 fs and an anomalously large initial anisotropy of 0.7 in the bleaching and stimulated - emission signal has been observed .",
    "these results have been interpreted in the simple model of a homogeneous system in which excitations are delocalized over the whole ring .",
    "the high initial anisotropy was ascribed to coherent excitation of a degenerate pair of states with allowed transitions and the relaxations to electronic dephasing and equilibration with states at lower energies which have forbidden transitions .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that excitation of membrane - bound lh2 complexes with low - intensity femtosecond pulses causes changes in absorption and stimulated emission that initially depend on the excitation wavelength but relax to a quasi - equilibrium with a time constant of 100  @xmath9  20  fs . the signals have an apparent initial anisotropy of approximately 0.5 when the complex is excited with broadband pulses , and of 0.35 - 0.4 with narrower pulses .",
    "the anisotropy decays to 0.1 with a time constant of about 30  fs .    using a density - matrix formalism nagarjan et al.@xcite",
    "have shown that the initial light - induced signals are consistent with coherent excitation of multiple exciton levels in an inhomogeneous ensemble of lh2 complexes and that the main features of the spectral relaxations and the anisotropy can be explained by electronic dephasing and thermal equilibration within the manifold of exciton levels .",
    "for one initial state three different possibilities of the form of the exciton density matrix @xmath10 have been taken into account . beside the full matrix description , which has been represented as a coherent superposition of the allowed `` one exciton '' states , the second",
    "is obtained by setting the off - diagonal terms of @xmath10 to zero , which gives an incoherent mixture of one - exciton states with the same initial populations .",
    "finally , in the third form the diagonal elements of @xmath10 are replaced by the populations for a boltzmann equilibrium at temperature t ( with the off - diagonal terms zero ) .",
    "nagarjan et al.@xcite have discussed several different processes which could contribute to the spectral relaxations and the rapid decay of the anisotropy .",
    "they concluded , that the main features of the spectral relaxations and the decay of anisotropy are reproduced well by a model that considers decay processes of electronic coherences within the manifold of the exciton states and the thermal equilibration among excitonic states .",
    "they have not attempted to calculate the dynamics theoretically .",
    "but the model described in @xcite appears capable of rationalizing the observation that the anisotropy decay is faster than the spectral relaxation .",
    "moderate static disorder , which leads to electronic dephasing , causes a large decrease in the calculated anisotropy , whereas the relaxation of the overall signal occurs mainly during thermalization , because the two most strongly allowed exciton states tend to be close together in energy and to have approximately orthogonal transition dipoles .",
    "nagarjan et al .",
    "@xcite concluded that the static inhomogeneity assumed in their lh2 model would cause the off - diagonal terms @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the density matrix to decay with a time constant of the order of 160  fs .",
    "this suggests that the more rapid dephasing indicated by the anisotropy decay ( @xmath13  fs ) is driven mainly by dynamic processes .    the aim of the present paper is to extend the investigation by kumble and hochstrasser @xcite and also by nagarjan et al .",
    "@xcite taking into account the simultaneous influence of static and dynamic disorders on the exciton scattering after impulse excitation and on the time - dependent optical anisotropy .",
    "different time dependent spectroscopic properties have been calculated before but within the secular approximation @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows : in the next section we present the model we have used . in section 3",
    "several different theories giving the dynamical equations for the exciton density matrix are reviewed .",
    "our results are presented in section 4 and in the last section we discuss them and draw some conclusions .",
    "in this paper we deal with just one exciton , already created at time @xmath14 , on a ring interacting with a heat bath .",
    "the hamiltonian therefore consists of three parts : @xmath15 the first term is the hamiltonian @xmath16 belonging to the single exciton in the ideal ring .",
    "operators @xmath17 or @xmath18 create or annihilate an exciton at site @xmath19 .",

    "the diagonal elements @xmath23 are the local energies @xmath24 at site @xmath22 which could take into account , e.g. , a dimerization @xmath25 .",
    "the second term , @xmath26 , describes the phonons .",
    "we assume independent heat baths for each chromophore and the harmonic approximation for the phonons . @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote phonon creation and annihilation operators , respectively .",
    "the last term , @xmath29 , represents the interaction between the exciton and the bath .",
    "the exciton ",

    "can be diagonalized using the wave vector representation with corresponding delocalized `` bloch '' states and energies .",
    "considering , e.g. , only nearest neighbor transfer matrix elements @xmath34 , the same local energies @xmath35 at every site and using fourier transformed excitonic operators ( bloch representation ) @xmath36 the simplest exciton hamiltonian in @xmath37 representation reads @xmath38 the dispersion of the excitonic energies is given by @xmath39 a splitting of the local degenerate exciton energies in one ring , to a band of energies @xmath40 , corresponding to the exciton eigenstates , is produced .",
    "the quasistatic disorder is described by the time - dependent part of the hamiltonian @xmath41 .",
    "this part @xmath42 describes fluctuations of the local excitation energies @xmath43 due to slow motion of the protein environment .",
    "fluctuations of the local excitation energies @xmath43 have exponentially decaying correlation functions .",
    "the mean values and correlation functions are given by @xmath44 @xmath45 in what follows the simplification is used , that we work only with pure static disorder , @xmath46 , and a gaussian distribution for the uncorrelated local energy fluctuations @xmath47 with a standard deviation @xmath5 .      despite the long history of theoretical and computer modeling of the experimental results no unified set of microscopic parameters entering the hamiltonian",
    "@xmath48 has been revealed up to now @xcite .",
    "the one - exciton band of the ideal ring @xmath49 consists of two groups of 9 transitions arranged asymmetrically relative to the zero local site energy .",
    "these davydov manifolds appear because the 18 bchl molecules in the b850 ring are grouped into heterodimers with different coupling energies within the elementary dimers @xmath31 and between them @xmath32 as well as different local energies @xmath50 .    in the presence of static disorder ( @xmath51 in @xmath52 )",
    "virtually all exciton transitions gain strength at the expense of the low energy @xmath53 transitions , which dominate the spectrum of the ideal b850 ring .",
    "there is still a discrepancy between the measurement by freiberg et al .",
    "@xcite and results of hole - burning experiments by small ( see references in @xcite ) . in the former experiments",
    "considerable intensity of about @xmath54 ( averaged over a large ensemble ) attained by the lowest @xmath55 transition has been revealed . in interpreting these experiments",
    "it was concluded @xcite that the shape of the linear absorption spectrum of b850 at 8  k could be well reproduced by taking @xmath56 .",
    "the hole burning results at 4  k imply much smaller disorder leading to a relative intensity of the @xmath55 subband of only @xmath57 .",
    "the model parameters obtained by freiberg from fitting the simulated linear and nonlinear absorption spectra to the low temperature experimental data are the transfer integrals @xmath58  @xmath59 and @xmath60  @xmath59 as well as the strength of the static disorder @xmath61",
    "@xmath59 with @xmath62  @xmath59 .",

    "koolhaas et al.@xcite have recently obtained the transfer integrals @xmath71  @xmath59 and @xmath72  @xmath59 .    in what follows",
    "we will use the transfer integral @xmath31 as energy unit .",
    "we choose @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath5 between 0.2 and 1 . to convert the time @xmath75 in these units into seconds one has to divide @xmath75 by @xmath76 with @xmath77 the speed of light in cm / s and @xmath31 in units of @xmath59 .",
    "so @xmath78 corresponds to 21.2  fs for @xmath79 and to 13.3  fs for @xmath80 .      for a coplanar arrangement of site transition moments",
    "@xmath81 dipole - allowed transitions from the ground state populate only the degenerate @xmath82 levels of the ideal ( without dynamic and static disorders ) ring with hamiltonian @xmath83 and eigenstates @xmath84 .",
    "if static disorder of the local energies is present ( @xmath85 ) , the stationary states , i.e.  the eigenstates @xmath86 of the hamiltonian @xmath87 , correspond to mixtures of @xmath88 and an excitation will prepare a superposition of the @xmath89 states .    however , kumble and hochstrasser @xcite concluded , that in the case of pump - pulse excitation the dipole strength is simply redistributed among the exciton levels due to disorder .",
    "so the amplitudes of site excitations and the phase relationships in the initial state are necessarily identical to that of an equal superposition of @xmath90 excitons of the ideal ring .",
    "thus , generally , the excitation with a pump pulse of sufficiently wide spectral bandwidth will always prepare the same initial state , irrespective of the actual eigenstates of the system .",
    "the nature of this initial state is entirely determined by the selection rules of the unperturbed system .",

    "the nonexponential nature of scattering dynamics has been demonstrated : for @xmath107 the initial state decays in two distinct phases ; a dominant @xmath108  fs component and a slower ( 200300  fs ) decay are evident .",
    "optical anisotropy measurements provide a convenient mean to follow experimentally the decay of a virtual exciton within the lh2 ring . since this initial state is prepared as a superposition of eigenstates of the aggregate , polarized pump - probe ( or fluorescence ) signals contain contributions from interference terms which last so long that the phase coherence between different levels is maintained .",
    "the decay of these cross terms directly reflects the time scale of electronic dephasing . in the present case it therefore represents the survival time of a virtual exciton within the disordered system .",
    "kumble and hochstrasser @xcite calculated the usual time - dependent anisotropy using @xmath109 where the brackets @xmath110 denote the ensemble average and the average over the direction of the laser pulses with fixed relative directions @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
