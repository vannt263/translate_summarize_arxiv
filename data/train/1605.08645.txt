    "chiral magnets , i.e. magnets with a non - centrosymmetric crystal lattice , show a variety of non - collinear magnetic states stabilized by the relativistic dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction .",
    "the recent discovery of skyrmions in chiral magnets @xcite led to many theoretical and experimental studies of unusual physical properties of these topological excitations @xcite .",
    "low critical currents required to set skyrmions into motion @xcite opened a new active field of research in memory and logic devices , in which information is carried by skyrmions @xcite .    the dm interaction imprints the chirality of crystal lattice into the chirality of magnetic orders : the direction of spin rotation in spirals and skyrmions is determined by the lattice .",
    "non - collinear magnetism can also originate from competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between spins in mott insulators .",
    "it was recently shown that frustrated magnets form a new class of materials that can host skyrmion crystals and isolated skyrmions @xcite .",
    "in contrast to dm interactions , exchange interactions are insensitive to the direction of spin rotation in non - collinear magnetic states , which gives skyrmions two additional degrees of freedom  vorticity and helicity ( see fig .",
    "1a ) , and leads to new interesting new physics @xcite .",
    "magnetic frustration is not limited to mott insulators : rkky interactions @xcite , competing double exchange and superexchange interactions @xcite , double exchange in charge - transfer systems @xcite and fluxes of effective magnetic fields @xcite can stabilize non - collinear and even non - coplanar magnetic states in itinerant magnets .    here",
    ", we explore the current - induced dynamics of skyrmions and antiskyrmions in nanostripes of frustrated magnets ( see fig",
    ". 1a ) and show that it is strongly affected by the periodically modulated spin structures formed at the stripe edges .",
    "these edge states are topological and have a highly non - linear dynamics of their own : under an applied electric current they emit and absorb skyrmions and antiskyrmions .",
    "these processes , governed by a topological conservation law , allow for electric control of edge state topology .",
    "the nontrivial skyrmion topology gives rise to a high energy barrier that prevents the decay of skyrmions into magnons .",
    "however , near the boundaries of a magnet this barrier can be significantly lower or may not exist at all .",
    "therefore , the practical use of skyrmions crucially depends on their repulsion from edges of magnetic nanostructures . in chiral magnets such a repulsion",
    "is naturally provided by the bulk dm interaction , which tilts the magnetization vector away from the magnetic field direction at the edges of a magnet , giving rise to the so - called edge states @xcite .",
    "competing spin interactions in frustrated magnets do not necessarily induce similar spin tilts . however , exchange interactions and magnetic anisotropies at surfaces or interfaces of magnetic materials can be significantly different from those in bulk , because of a lower symmetry of magnetic ions at the edges @xcite .",
    "we have found that a strong surface anisotropy gives rise to edge states in frustrated magnets with a variety of complex structures , which confine skyrmions to a nanostripe .",
    "we studied minimal - energy states in a stripe of a frustrated magnet @xcite , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the unit vector in the direction of the magnetization at the site @xmath10 of a triangular lattice .",
    "the first and the second terms in the energy describe the competing ferromagnetic nearest - neighbour and antiferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbour interactions ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 is the magnetic field applied in the @xmath3-direction normal to the stripe , @xmath13 is the bulk _ easy axis _ magnetic anisotropy and @xmath14 is the _ easy plane",
    "_ anisotropy added near the edges .",
    "the rich phase diagram of this model counts 8 different phases including the skyrmion crystal state @xcite .",
    "important for our present study is a large region of the field - induced collinear ferromagnetic state , where isolated skyrmions are stable .",
    "we use the set of bulk model parameters , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( in units of @xmath18 ) , for which spins _ inside the stripe _ are collinear .",
    "figure 1b shows three types of evanescent edge states induced by the easy plane surface anisotropy in one or more rows at the edges of the magnetic stripe .",
    "the type i edge state with collinear in - plane spin components is induced by @xmath19 in the first row ; @xmath20 in the three rows induces type ii state  the evanescent conical spiral state with the wave vector along the boundary ( @xmath2-direction ) and the in - plane magnetization vector rotating around the @xmath3 axis .",
    "@xmath21 in the first two row and @xmath22 in the second row give rise to type iii state , in which the in - plane magnetization vector shows fan - like oscillations around a fixed direction in the @xmath23-plane .",
    "importantly , in all edge states the in - plane magnetization oscillates with the decaying amplitude along the @xmath7-axis normal to the edge ( see fig .",
    "these oscillations are a characteristic property of frustrated magnets and the three types of edge states are generic .",
    "the origin of the oscillations can be understood by considering asymptotic of the in - plane magnetization vector , @xmath24 , deep inside the magnetic stripe . in the continuum limit , @xmath25 , @xmath26 where the first two terms originate from the expansion of the exchange energy of a frustrated magnet in powers of @xmath27 @xmath28 .",
    "this bi - quadratic equation with real coefficients has four solutions : @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "in the situation when modulated states are suppressed in the bulk , all four wave vectors have a nonzero imaginary part @xmath31 .",
    "they can be grouped into two pairs according to the sign of @xmath31 : @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "one pair describes @xmath34 with an amplitude decreasing away from the upper edge and another pair describes the evanescent state near the lower edge .",
    "the real parts of the two wave vectors in each pair have opposite signs .",

    "the potential energy is measured in units of energy of an isolated skyrmion .",
    "@xmath37 was calculated by imposing the constraint , @xmath38 , at the skyrmion centre and minimizing the energy with respect to spins at all other sites .",
    "( b ) the potential energy landscape for skyrmion interacting with type iii state .",
    "the local minima of @xmath37 give rise to a sequence of edge channels separated by the potential barriers , which guide the current - induced motion of skyrmions .",
    "the first channel corresponds to the global minimum of @xmath37 . ]    in fact , any magnetic defect in frustrated magnets , such as skyrmion or domain wall , gives rise to similar decaying spin oscillations .",
    "they lead to sign changes of the skyrmion - skyrmion interaction potential as a function of distance between two skyrmions @xcite .",
    "similarly , the interaction energy of skyrmion with an edge state , @xmath37 , oscillates with @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "this leads to a sequence of edge channels centered around minima of @xmath37 ( see fig .",
    "2b ) , which run continuously along the boundaries of a nanostructure and guide the motion of skyrmions .    in eq . ( [ eq : q ] ) @xmath39 . for periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath2 direction , @xmath40 , where @xmath0 is the length of the stripe and @xmath41 is an integer number . thus eq . ( [ eq : q ] ) gives @xmath42 for a given @xmath41 . for type i state , @xmath43 ; for the type ii state shown in fig .",
    "1b , @xmath44 and the type iii state shown in the same figure is a superposition of type i and type ii states .",
    "in the continuum limit , in which the period of modulated states and the skyrmion diameter are much larger than the lattice constant , the spin model eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) can be used to describe itinerant frustrated magnets .",
    "we study the current - induced dynamics of skyrmions and antiskyrmions in the stripe of a frustrated magnet with edge states by solving landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation ( see methods ) with the electric current @xmath45 running along the stripe ( see fig .",
    "1a and supplementary movies 1 and 2 ) .",
    "in contrast to chiral magnets , the skyrmion vorticity @xmath46 in frustrated magnets can have either sign , @xmath47 @xcite , so that for a given direction of the magnetic field , the skyrmion topological charge , @xmath48 , also can have either sign .",
    "assuming @xmath49 , we call the magnetic defects with positive vorticity , @xmath50 , skyrmions , while those with @xmath51 are called antiskyrmions . figure 3a shows the time dependence of the @xmath7-coordinate of skyrmion , initially placed into the channel 3 , for several values of the electric current ( see supplementary movie 1 ) .",
    "a relatively low current , @xmath52 , moves skyrmion along the channel .",
    "a larger current , @xmath53 , forces skyrmion to jump into the channel 2 , and @xmath54 , eventually brings skyrmion into the channel 1 ( the one closest to the edge ) .",
    "figure 3b shows that the @xmath2-component of the skyrmion velocity @xmath55 varies , when the skyrmion moves across channels , and approaches a constant value , when it moves in a channel . thus the channel , in which skyrmion moves , can be selected by the electric current .",
    "motion of skyrmions through multi - channel structures formed by edge states .",
    "( a ) time dependence of the @xmath7-coordinate of the skyrmion centre for @xmath56 ( see supplementary movie 1 ) .",
    "skyrmion is initially located in the third channel of type iii edge state . for @xmath52 skyrmion moves in the third channel ( green dash - dotted line )",
    "; for @xmath53 , it jumps into the second channel ( dashed red line ) and for @xmath54 it eventually ends up in the first channel ( black solid line ) .",
    "( b ) time dependence of the skyrmion drift velocity , @xmath55 , for the same parameters as in panel ( a ) . for @xmath54 ,",
    "skyrmion changes channels twice , which gives rise to two humps in @xmath57 . in the steady state @xmath58 .",

    "for the steady state motion along a channel , @xmath63 . ]    the driving force for the channel switching is the skyrmion hall effect , i.e. the skyrmion motion with a velocity @xmath64 in the direction transverse to the applied current @xcite .",
    "the skyrmions and antiskyrmions are deflected towards opposite edges of the magnetic stripe , which eventually drives them into the edge channels where both @xmath55 and @xmath64 are strongly affected by the oscillating edge - state potential , @xmath37 .",
    "the skyrmion motion through the system of edge channels is qualitatively described by thiele equation @xcite : @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 is the gilbert damping constant and @xmath59 describes the non - adiabatic spin - torque .    for an unconstrained skyrmion motion away from the edges ( @xmath69 ) and",
    "( [ eq : thiele ] ) gives @xmath70 for @xmath71 . on the other hand , for a skyrmion moving along the channel ( @xmath72 ) , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the skyrmion hall effect pushes skyrmion to a slope of the potential well , which gives rise to the force , @xmath75 , in the transverse direction .",
    "if the potential separating neighbouring channels is not high enough to provide the necessary force , the skyrmion jumps into another channel .",
    "equation ( [ eq : constrained ] ) also applies to type ii and type iii edge states that are inhomogeneous along the @xmath2 axis and , therefore , move along the boundary when an electric current is applied .",
    "when skyrmion is captured by such an edge state , they move with the same speed .",
    "this speed is proportional to @xmath59 and the motion stops for @xmath62 ( see fig . 3c and supplementary movie 2 ) .",
    "thiele equation ( [ eq : thiele ] ) ignores the helicity dynamics of skyrmions @xcite .",
    "supplementary movie 2 shows that the transverse motion of skyrmion from one channel into another is accompanied by a rotation of spins in the skyrmion , resulting from the skyrmion deformation in the edge state potential .",
    "the simultaneous presense of skyrmions and antiskyrmions in frustrated magnets can be very useful for implementation of logical operations .",
    "however , since skyrmions and antiskyrmions have the same energy , they can form random mixtures ( see fig .",
    "the skyrmion hall effect can be employed to separate them : since the sign of the transverse velocity depends on the sign of topological charge ( eq .",
    "( [ unconstrained ] ) ) , skyrmions and antiskyrmions under an applied current move towards opposite edges .",
    "supplementary movie 3 shows how the skyrmion hall effect and a notch at one of the edges help to filter out antiskyrmions . the final state with skyrmions separated from antiskyrmions",
    "is shown in fig . 4b .",
    "above a critical electric current edge states become unstable against emission of skyrmion - antiskyrmion pairs .",
    "figure 5 and supplementary movie 4 show complex dynamics of type ii edge states under an applied current @xmath76 .",
    "these spiral edge states with in - plane spins at the edge are characterized by the winding number , @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the angle describing the spin orientation and the @xmath79 sign is for the upper / lower edge . for periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath2 axis",

    "the skyrmion hall effect pushes skyrmions towards the lower edge , while antiskyrmions return to the upper edge ( figs .",
    "after the skyrmions and antiskyrmions have vanished at the corresponding edges , the winding numbers of the edge states become @xmath82 ( fig .",
    "then the lower edge state becomes unstable and emits 2 skyrmion - antiskyrmion pairs ( fig .",
    "5h ) , which separate into two skyrmions that return to the lower edge and two skyrmions that move towards the upper edge ( fig .",
    "5e ) . in the final state ( fig .",
    "5i ) the winding numbers of the edge states are @xmath83 and @xmath84 , i.e. in the end of these transformations the upper and lower edge states exchanged their winding numbers .",

    "separation of skyrmions from antiskyrmions in a nanotrack with a notch .",
    "( a ) the initial state of two skyrmions ( their positive topological charge density is indicated by yellow colour ) and four antiskyrmions ( dark green colour indicating negative topological charge density ) .",

    "the motion of skyrmions is hindered by a notch .",
    "skyrmions are deflected towards the lower - edge channels of the nanotrack . ]",
    "these metamorphoses can be understood , if we notice that the type ii edge state with in - plane spins at the edge has topological charge , @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the @xmath3-component of the unit magnetization vector @xmath89 at the edge , @xmath90 is the bulk value of @xmath91 and @xmath41 is the winding number of the edge state . for @xmath92 and @xmath93 , the topological charge , @xmath94 , is integer or half - integer .",
    "more generally , edge states carry a fractional topological charge .",
    "the reason for the instability of the upper - edge state , which initially had @xmath95 , is the skyrmion hall effect that , for @xmath96 , pushes this state downwards .",
    "similarly , the lower - edge state with a negative topological number is pushed upwards , which leads to its instability ( figs .",
    "5f , g ) . in the stable final state ( fig .",
    "5i ) the upper - edge state has negative topological charge , @xmath97 , and lower - edge state has positive topological charge , @xmath98 .",
    "these states can be made unstable by reversing the direction of the electric current .",
    "remarkably , when skyrmion or antiskyrmion vanishes at an edge , the winding number of the edge state changes by @xmath99 , which suggests that such processes are governed by a conservation law of topological nature .",
    "the total topological charge of the stripe equal the sum of topological charges of skyrmions , antiskyrmions and the two edge states , is not conserved .",
    "for example , when a skyrmion with @xmath100 `` passes '' through the lower edge , the topological charge of the edge state increases by @xmath101 .",
    "what is conserved , is the total vorticity equal the sum of vorticities of skyrmions and antiskyrmions inside the stripe and the winding numbers of the edge states : @xmath102 here , @xmath103 is the number of skyrmions with vorticity @xmath104 and @xmath105 is the number of antiskyrmions with vorticity @xmath106 .",
    "one can check that @xmath107 is invariant under all transmutations shown in fig . 5 , including the emission of skyrmion - antiskyrmion pairs .",
    "when skyrmion is absorbed by an edge , the ring of in - plane spins winding around the skyrmion centre is cut , stretched into a straight segment and becomes a part of the edge state , which explains the conservation of vorticity .",
    "the current - induced instability of edge states in frustrated magnets that leads to emission of skyrmion - antiskyrmion pairs , is analogous to the magnetic - field induced instability of chiral magnets , which generates chains of skyrmions parallel to the edges @xcite .",
    "the novel aspect of our study is the crucial role of the edge state topology and the skyrmion hall effect for the emergence of the instability .",
    "the skyrmion hall effect is likely involved in the nucleation of skyrmions at boundaries with sharp corners @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq : conservation ] ) describing the conservation of the total vorticity in the skyrmion / antiskyrmion absorption by the edge states is similar to the winding number conservation that governs the dynamics of domain walls and half - integer vortices in ferromagnetic nanostripes @xcite . in those systems , however , magnetization is confined to the stripe plane , whereas in our case the magnetization inside the stripe is vertical .",
    "in conclusion , we showed that the states formed at the edges of frustrated magnets give rise to interesting physics , which can be useful in more than one way .",
    "the multiple edge channels continuously running along the boundaries of magnetic nanostructures and guiding the motion of skyrmions can be employed for magnetic patterning of nanodevices .",
    "skyrmions , which fit perfectly into these edge channels , can be directed by pulsed currents along different paths .",
    "the simultaneous presence of skyrmions and antiskyrmions , which under the applied current move towards opposite edges , opens new ways to do logical operations with these topological objects .",
    "our results suggest that information can be stored in winding numbers of edge states and manipulated by electric currents through the exchange of skyrmions and antiskyrmions between the edges .",
    "these results open new avenues for design of magnetic devices .",
