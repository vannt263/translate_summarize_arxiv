    "successive fe layers show oscillatory antiferromagnetic ( afm ) and fm couplings but with decreasing peak coupling strength .",
    "it is believed that in an external magnetic field @xmath2 , the magnetization in the fe layers are aligned as in a ferromagnetic material but in the absence of the magnetic field they are in antiferromagnetic configuration .",
    "our study is focussed at finding the magnetic relaxation of these multilayers in low external magnetic fields ( @xmath3100 oe ) .",
    "thermoremanent magnetization is a thermally activated process .",
    "when the applied magnetic field is removed the magnetization tries to approach the remanent magnetization value in order to minimise the energy of the system .",
    "a magnetic system has dipolar energy , anisotropy energy , and exchange energy . in general , ferromagnetic materials",
    "do not respond to the magnetic fields immediately .",
    "there is a time lag between the application / withdrawl of the magnetic field and the response of magnetization to the field .",
    "this phenomenon is called `` magnetic viscosity '' @xcite .",
    "folks and street @xcite described this time lag by domain processes which progress through states of metastable equilibrium to a stable state .",
    "the major domain processes are :    1 .",
    "coherent or incoherent rotation of magnetization in single domain particles , 2 .   pinning and unpinning of domain boundary walls , and 3 .",
    "nucleation of domains of reverse magnetization .    coherent rotation of magnetization vector and the bloch - wall formation are primary consequences of lowering energy after the external field is applied / removed .",
    "thermal agitation plays an important role in transition from metastable to stable states .",
    "one may ask what are the time scales to achieve stable states for paramagnetic , fm , and afm materials . what is the role of magnetic interaction and crystal structure in the time dependence of magnetization ?",
    "dahlberg et al .",
    "@xcite explained the time dependence as a consequence of interactions or couplings .",
    "the interaction between relaxing spins , the dipole coupling , drives the system from an initial state towards the equilibrium state .",
    "they attributed the strong time dependence of the magnetization in co - cr films to the demagnetization in the film .",

    "found that in @xmath4 ( @xmath5 = 30 , fm phase ) m(t ) fits well to the power law decay .",
    "they found that with the increase of wait time , the exponent becomes smaller .",
    "for @xmath5 = 14 ( af phase ) also , power law decay describes m(t ) quite well and the exponent decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "chamberlin @xcite studied eus which is considered to be an ideal heisenberg fm system with a curie temperature @xmath6 k. they found that the plots of remanent magnetization versus logarithm of time show negative curvature for @xmath7(=17.75 k ) and exhibits an s - shaped curve for @xmath8 .",

    "leighton and schuller @xcite used time - dependent magnetization measurements to probe the asymmetry in the magnetization reversal mechanism in exchange - biased @xmath10 bilayers .",
    "they found that on one side of the loop , coherent rotation of magnetization plays an important role while on the other side the domain nucleation .",
    "the time dependence of the magnetization on the coherent rotation side of the loop had a form that is consistent with a small distribution of energy barriers .",
    "the side of the loop characterised by domain nucleation and propagation shows a logarithmic time dependence with a field dependent viscosity .",
    "similar investigation was also carried by fullerton and bader @xcite on fe / fesi multilayers .",
    "chamberlin et al .",
    "@xcite studied the time decay of the thermoremanent magnetization in 1.0 % cumn and 2.6 % agmn spin glasses .",
    "they found it to be a stretched exponential function . till that time",
    "no data had been published supporting an algebraic decay ( power law ) for magnetization .",
    "chamberlin also @xcite found that the effect of wait- time @xmath11 can be empirically characterised as an exponential decrease of the relaxation frequency with increasing wait time .",
    "if the sample is allowed to remain in the field - cooled state long enough before the field is removed , then the magnetization will not relax : a spin glass can have a permanent magnetization in zero field .",
    "chubykalo and gonzalez @xcite simulated the relaxational behavior of co - ni multilayers with different layer thickness .",

    "@xcite found that the magnetization relaxation of a @xmath13_{10}$ ] sample obeys a power - law decay of the thermoremanent magnetic moment with an asymptotic remanence when starting from a completely relaxed fc state .",
    "street and brown @xcite described two types of mechanisms that are responsible for the time dependence in ferromagnetic materials known as `` diffusion '' and `` fluctuation '' after - effect or viscosity .",
    "chantrell et al .",

    "the slow relaxation is related to the irreversible magnetic behavior via a fictitious fluctuation field @xmath14 which itself determines a quantity called the activation volume @xmath15 .",
    "both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are related to the magnetization reversal process . for granular materials @xmath15",
    "is generally smaller than the grain size . a simple model for the time dependence of the switching field in magnetic recording media by sharrock @xcite accounts for thermally assisted crossing of an energy barrier whose height is reduced by the applied field .",
    "goodman et al .",
    "@xcite studied a system with a narrow distribution of energy barriers .",
    "in such systems , at fields less than the coercive field , an accelerating variation of magnetization with log of time is seen and a decelerating behavior of field above the coercivity . in the coercive field region",
    "an ` s ' shaped variation is observed .",
    "our samples were grown on si substrates by ion beam sputter deposition technique using xe ion at 900 v with beam current of 20 ma and 1100 v with beam current of 30 ma .",
    "the typical structures are si / cr(50 )/[fe(20 )/cr(t )]@xmath16 30/cr(50 -t  ) . samples 1 - 4 have t = 6 , 8 , 10 and 12  , respectively . samples 1 and 2 are deposited at 900 v and samples 3 and 4 are at 1100 v. our multilayers show a gmr @xmath17 of @xmath18 1 , 33 , 20 and 21 % at 4.2 k for an external field of @xmath18 1 tesla ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "these samples are well characterised and the details have been given elsewhere@xcite .",
    "all the experiments were done with a quantum design superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer(mpms ) .",
    "a magnetic field of 100 oe is applied in the plane of the multilayer samples at 300 k and the sample is cooled down to the measuring temperature .",
    "after the temperature is stabilised , the magnetic field is set to zero and m(t ) measurements were started and continued till 12,000 s.",
    "chamberlin @xcite summarised the time dependence of magnetization in terms of different mathematical expressions as follows :",
    "the most popular empirical expression for characterising amorphous materials has been the kohlrausch - williams - watts stretched exponential @xmath20 .",
    "2 .   for crystals , the curie - von schweidler power law @xmath21 .",
    "3 .   for magnetic aftereffects , the nel logarithmic time dependence @xmath22 is popular .    when the applied magnetic field is removed , the magnetization takes finite time to cross the energy barrier for reversal .",
    "if the energy barriers are identical then the magnetic moment @xmath23 is given by @xcite    @xmath24    where    @xmath25    @xmath26 and @xmath27 are constants , @xmath28 represents the elapsed time , @xmath29 is the attempt frequency , @xmath30 is the activation energy , and t is the measurement temperature . when there is a distribution of barriers , then    @xmath31    here s is called the",
    " magnetic viscosity \" and @xmath32 is a constant at a given measuring field .",
    "s is expected to reach a peak value near the coercive field @xmath33 where the rate of change of the moment with time reaches the maximum .",
    "the intermediate case with a small distribution of barrier heights is more complicated to quantify .",
    "power - law behavior is predicted by scaling theories for domain growth and internal dynamics @xcite .",
    "calculations based on sherrington - kirkpatrick mean - field model suggest that the magnetization decays algebraically as    @xmath34    other treatments yield kolrausch - williams - watts stretched - exponential relaxation which is common in spin - glass like systems @xcite given by    @xmath35    when measured in a small static field , the temperature dependence of the magnetization of a spin glass changes abruptly at the glass transition temperature ( @xmath36 ) . above @xmath36",
    "the magnetization obeys the curie - weiss law , attributable to weakly interacting paramagnetic spins whereas below @xmath36 the magnetization is cooling history dependent .",
    "if it is field cooled then the magnetization is nearly independent of temperature below @xmath36 ; if it is zero - field cooled then the magnetization increases with increasing temperature .",
    "structure - wise our samples are a good combination of crystalline layers of ferromagnetic fe and antiferromagnetic cr and the polycrystalline interfaces .",
    "so these samples provide a complicated combination of crystalline layers and polycrystalline interfaces consisting of ferromagnetic , antiferromagnetic and spin - glass like structures as shown schematically in fig . [",
    "fig : sample ] . in this figure",
    "black and grey spheres represent cr and fe atoms , respectively .",
    "directions of the arrow show the direction of spin alignment .",
    "typical estimates of the relative strengths of the fe - fe , fe - cr , and cr - cr couplings are 1 : -0.3 : -0.18 @xcite and 1 : -0.55 : -0.3 @xcite .",
    "in other words , fe - fe coupling is fm and fe - cr & cr - cr couplings are af .",
    "fe - fe coupling is two / three times stronger than fe - cr coupling . ` ? ' in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] represents uncertainty of spin direction(frustration ) at that site . for a particular direction , either it will be violating the fm fe - fe coupling or the af fe - cr coupling . as the fe - fe coupling is stronger than the fe - cr and cr - cr coupling most of the frustration occurs at cr sites ( black spheres ) .",
    "attempts to explain magnetic relaxation with mathematical expressions began a century back .",
    "we have made a similar attempt to understand the response of the combined system for small magnetic fields .",
    "although chamberlin@xcite argued that these empirical expressions are simple mathematical formulae that give generally good agreement with a wide variety of measurements but demonstrating agreement with these formulae tells nothing about the mechanism of response .      in our multilayer system , the ferromagnetic fe layers have in - plane magnetization but as they are not super - lattices , there will be some domain like structures in the ferromagnetic plane with distribution of domain volume .",
    "thus we expect that there is a distribution of barriers for which logarithmic relaxation of magnetization is generally found .",
    "so we first tried the logarithmic fit in the form of eq .",
    "(  [ eq : ln ] ) . for our analysis",
    "we have taken data from 100 s to 12,000 s. we have made measurements with a squid magnetometer and it takes @xmath3 10 s to make one measurement and a much longer time to achieve stability and equilibrium condition after removal of the magnetic field .",
    "so we have not analysed the data for t @xmath0 100 s.    logarithmic relaxation gives excellent fits for samples 2 - 4 with correlation coefficients @xmath3 0.997 and the normalised @xmath37 consistent with the experimental resolution of one part in @xmath39 .",
    "for sample 1 , which has the least gmr , the fit is not so good ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "figures [ fig : s2ln ] , [ fig : x4alllog ] , and [ fig : x6alllog ] show the raw m vs. ln t data and the fits for samples 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively at different temperatures . for each sample",
    ", @xmath32 decreases with increasing temperature which can be understood as the decrease in magnetization due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "the coefficient s , which is termed as the magnetic viscosity , initially increases linearly with temperature ; then it decreases at higher temperatures .",
    "larger s implies larger change in the magnetization during the observational time period .",
    "s shows a peak around @xmath36 of the zfc magnetization curves ( samples 2 - 4 show @xmath36 at @xmath3 62 , 123 , and 83 k , respectively taken at 100 oe @xcite ) .",
    "this can be understood as follows : at temperatures much lower than the freezing temperature , due to the low temperature ( less thermal energy ) , the magnetic moments can not relax much ( as they are nearly frozen ) .",
    "so lower the temperature lower is the value of s. at temperatures much higher than the freezing temperature , due to higher thermal energy the system behaves more and more like a paramagnetic / superparamagnetic system . in the paramagnetic region the entire magnetization relaxes very rapidly ( @xmath010 s)@xcite . so in our measurement time window ( @xmath41 s ) we hardly observe any relaxation and hence s looks small . at around @xmath36 in the zfc magnetization curve ,",
    "the thermal energy provides the moments freedom to move and they can also interact with one another . in this region ,",
    "the system is like a spin glass which is about to unfreeze and so the magnetization responds much faster .",
    "that is why we find maxima in the magnetic viscosity vs. temperature curves .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pwrp ] . to make the comparison more clear we have shown the percentage change in magnetization with time at different temperatures for sample 2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : f83d ] . similar variation of s with temperature was found by guy @xcite in a au - fe spin - glass alloy containing 2 at .",
    "however , lottis et al .",
    "@xcite found broad maxima in the temperature dependence of s in co - cr films .",
    "figure [ fig : s1ln ] shows the raw m vs. ln t data and the fit for sample 1 .",
    "sample 1 showed the least gmr .",
    "the interpretation for the least gmr is that in this sample with cr thickness of 6   most fe layers are coupled ferromagnetically to the neighbouring fe layers .",
    "so the whole sample is like a fm material .",
    "the zfc magnetization measurements of this sample show that the magnetization decreases monotonically with increasing temperature .",
    "so measurement temperatures of 50 , 100 , and 150 k are much above the @xmath12 of this sample .",
    "the magnetization , plotted on a logarithmic scale , has clearly an ` s'- shape as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s1ln ] .    next we tried to fit the data to the power law in the form of eq .",
    "(  [ eq : power ] ) .",
    "we find that the power law gives equally good fits for samples 2 - 4 , with @xmath42 0.99 along with @xmath37 consistent with the experimental resolution .",
    "the numerical value of the parameter @xmath43 is the same as of the parameter ` s ' divided by @xmath32 of eq .",
    "(  [ eq : ln ] ) .",
    "we can rewrite eq .",
    "(  [ eq : power ] ) as      since @xmath43 is very small and so we can neglect higher order terms .",
    "this has a form similar to that of eq .",
    "(  [ eq : ln ] ) . for larger time scale @xmath45",
    "s , @xmath46 decreases faster than @xmath47 .",
    "we have tried to show this feature in fig .",
    "[ fig : s3ex ] .",
    "in other words , from our measurement time window we shall not be able to distinguish log and power fits .",
    "however , a careful observation from tables i - iv indicates a small difference between the two fits .",
    "(  [ eq : ln ] ) gives better fit than eq .",
    "(  [ eq : power ] ) at low temperatures but at higher temperatures ( much above @xmath36 ) eq .",
    "(  [ eq : power ] ) gives better fits .",
    "sample 1 does not have @xmath36 or @xmath12 in the measured temperature range and so the power law fit is better for all the temperatures .",
    "a stronger proof would have been possible if we could take data till @xmath48 s.    next we tried the stretched exponential fit in the form of eq .",
    "(  [ eq : strexp ] ) .",
    "the low - field magnetization measurements on samples 2 - 4 had shown spin - glass - like history dependent behaviour .",
    "but this fitting gave unrealistic large time constants @xmath49 with equally large errors .",
    "to conclude , in these sputtered gmr multilayers which are structural combinations of fm fe films , af cr films , and fe - cr mixed interfaces , the magnetization decays logarithmically at low temperatures and above @xmath36 the magnetization decays algebraically . in the multilayers",
    "one expects less distribution of energy barriers but we could not find any exponential decay . for ` afm ' ( sample 2 , 3 , and 4 ) and ` fm ' ( sample 1 ) multilayers we found different decay mechanisms . the power law decay is better at higher temperatures .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish between ` good afm ' ( sample 2 with gmr of 33 % ) and ` afm ' ( sample 3 with gmr of 21 % and sample 4 with gmr of 20 % ) samples from their decay behavior .",
