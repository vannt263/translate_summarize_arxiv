    "both the kait and itagaki prediscovery data were taken in unfiltered bands , while our multi - filter observations began only after discovery ; thus , here we focus our analysis on the early unfiltered light curve .",
    "all kait images were reduced using our image - reduction pipeline ( ganeshalingam et  al .",
    "2010 ) , and we similarly processed and reduced all of the itagaki images . in order to remove the host - galaxy contribution , we applied the same image - subtraction procedure to both kait and itagaki images using a galaxy template image taken with each telescope before the sn explosion .",
    "figure [ fc_kait ] shows several examples of both kait and itagaki images before and after subtraction , with sn  2014j located at the center of each image .",
    "point - spread - function photometry was then performed using daophot ( stetson 1987 ) from the idl astronomy user s library .",
    "the sn instrumental magnitudes have been calibrated to two nearby stars from the usno b1.0 catalog : s1 with @xmath17mag and j2000 coordinates @xmath18 , @xmath19 ; s2 with @xmath20mag and j2000 coordinates @xmath21 , @xmath22 .    for nondetections , we present an upper - limit magnitude ( 3@xmath23 ) .",
    "owing to the complicated background light from m82 , it is inappropriate to measure the image noise directly from the original image .",
    "however , the host - galaxy background structure is mostly absent after subtraction ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fc_kait ] ) .",
    "we therefore measure the standard deviation in the residual image at several positions around sn  2014j and use these to derive a 3@xmath23 upper limit on the object s brightness and its uncertainty for each image .",
    "this is further cross - checked by simulation : we inject a simulated star signal ( 3@xmath23 of sky noise ) into the nondetection images at the sn position , perform the same subtraction procedure , and measure the magnitude of the simulated star in residual images using aperture photometry . in 100 simulation trials ,",
    "we are able to recover a majority ( @xmath24% ) of the measurements with a mean magnitude value within 0.1mag of our reported limiting magnitude .",
    "our analysis includes unfiltered observations from two separate telescopes and cameras , so it is necessary to measure any possible offset between kait and itagaki magnitudes before beginning a joint analysis .",
    "since both are unfiltered , the response of each system is dominated by the ccd quantum efficiency ( qe ) .",
    "kait uses a microline 77 camera from finger lakes instrumentation ( chip model e2v ccd77 - 00-bi - imo ) , with a qe curve that reaches half - peak values at @xmath25  3800 and @xmath25  8900 .",
    "itagaki uses a bn-83e camera manufactured by bitran ( chip model kaf-1001e ) , with a qe curve that reaches half - peak values at @xmath25  4100 and @xmath25  8900 .",
    "these response curves , and therefore the effective passbands of the two systems , are very similar .",
    "however , we can directly check by comparing photometry of isolated field stars that are present in both datasets .",
    "we did this for more than 30 stars in 4 different fields ( including the sn  2014j field ) that have recently been observed by both kait and itagaki .",
    "we find that , overall , the unfiltered magnitudes measured from kait and itagaki have a systematic offset of only 0.02mag and a scatter of 0.02mag .",
    "these stars exhibit a range of more than 0.9mag in @xmath26 color , so we expect color - dependent difference between the two photometric systems to be small .",

[ figure_lc_brokenpl ] ]    to determine the first - light time , one can assume that the sn luminosity scales as the surface area of the expanding fireball , and therefore increases quadratically with time ( @xmath36 , commonly known as the @xmath37 model ; e.g. , arnett 1982 ; riess et  al .",
    "the @xmath37 model provides a good fit for several sne  ia with early observations ( e.g. , sn  2011fe , nugent et  al .",

    "we applied this model to the joint dataset from both kait and itagaki , finding a poor fit ( with @xmath38 per degree of freedom of 1.73 ) ; the data imply a steeper power - law index .",

    "though the simple power - law model fits the detected light curve well ( dashed black line in fig .  [ figure_lc_brokenpl ] ) , it is strongly at odds with both the kait and itagaki nondetections .",
    "the very deep nondetection limit requires the first - light time to be much closer to our first detection point , and a rapid increase in brightness ( more than 4mag ) within a short time ( one day ) therefore yields a different power - law index .",
    "this is very similar to the case of sn  2013dy , which also showed a very rapid rise ( the brightness of sn 2013dy increased more than 2mag within the first 0.5d ) .",
    "hence , in a manner similar to our work on sn  2013dy ( z13 ) , as well as to models widely used for observed gamma - ray burst afterglows ( e.g. , zheng et  al .",

    ", we were able to constrain the value of @xmath35 with a very early detection of sn  2013dy ; sadly , we do not have a similarly early detection of sn  2014j .",
    "however , we use two methods to obtain quite narrow limits on the first - light time with the existing data . in method 1",
    ", we treat the latest nondetection as a marginal  real detection , \" yielding an effective upper limit on the value of @xmath35 . assuming our broken power - law model applies back to the time of first light",
    ", it also provides a lower limit on this time .",
    "based on this assumption , and setting the time of our first detection to @xmath48 , our best fit gives @xmath49d , @xmath50d , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "this implies that first light occurred on jan .  14.54 , and the fit is shown by the solid red line in figure [ figure_lc_brokenpl ] . in method 2",
    ", we assume that the very early rise of sn  2014j was similar to that of sn  2013dy . the best - fit @xmath35 value found for sn  2013dy was @xmath55 ( z13 ) . to place a conservative upper limit on the first - light time of sn  2014j",
    ", we adopt @xmath56 , the @xmath35 value ( 3@xmath23 ) from sn  2013dy .",
    "we find a best - fit model with @xmath57d , @xmath58d , @xmath59 , @xmath56 ( fixed during fitting ) , and @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "this implies that first light occurred on jan .  14.96 , and the fit is shown by the dotted red line in figure [ figure_lc_brokenpl ] .",
    "as shown above , the best fits for the @xmath62 model and the two broken power - law models are much better than the @xmath37 model . the @xmath63 value for the @xmath62 model and the two broken power - law models are comparable , but a simple @xmath63 analysis does not take into account the strong constraints from our nondetections , which rule out a simple power - law model .",
    "we therefore favor the broken power - law model .",
    "our two methods constrain the time of first light to be somewhere between @xmath64d and @xmath65d before our first detection .",
    "we adopt , as our best estimate , the mean of these two values : jan .  14.75 , or @xmath2d before our first detection .",
    "both the iptf - h@xmath9 and rotse detections are after , and thus consistent with , our derived first - light time ( by 0.43d and 0.63d , respectively ) .",
    "this makes sn  2014j one of the earliest detected sne  ia , along with sn  2013dy ( 0.10d after first light ; z13 ) , sn  2011fe ( 0.46d ; nugent et  al .",
    "2011 ) , and sn 2009ig ( 0.71d ; foley",
    "et  al . 2012 ) .",
    "the extremely rapid rise in the first day of sn  2014j s light curve reinforces several of the conclusions obtained by z13 when studying sn  2013dy , showing that the @xmath37 model is not sufficient for every sn  ia .",
    "( 1 ) within the first day after first light , some sne  ia exhibit a very rapid increase in brightness , in the case of sn  2014j becoming more than 4mag brighter in a single day . actually observing this very rapid rise is a challenge given the very short timespan over which it occurs .",
    "( 2 ) some sn  ia light curves are best described by power laws with an exponent not equal to 2 ( see also piro & nakar 2012 ) .",
    "( 3 ) the best - fit power - law exponent likely varies with time . with sn  2014j ,",
    "we add to the mounting evidence that the @xmath37 model has worked for previous sne  ia only because observations constraining the shape of the light curve at very early times were rare .",
    "the early - time light curves of sn  2013dy and sn  2014j demonstrate that a varying power - law exponent may be a common phenomenon in the light curves of very young sne  ia , and that sne  ia are likely more complex than the simple fireball model assumes .",
    "the physical explanation for the varying exponent of sne  ia is still unclear .",
    "perhaps the very early fireball exhibits significant changes in either the photospheric temperature or the velocity during expansion , or the fireball input energy may change owing to the geometric structure of the ni@xmath66 distribution in outer layers .",
    "another possibility is that the very early light curve may include some contribution from the shock - heated cooling emission after shock breakout , although this phenomenon is predicted to exhibit a power - law index of 1.5 ( @xmath67 ; see eq .",
