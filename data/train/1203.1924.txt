    "the bl lac objects constitute a rare class of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "their observational features include : weak or absent emission lines , high radio and optical polarization , superluminal motions , and a typical double - humped spectral energy distribution ( sed , @xmath3 ) .",
    "their continuum emission is dominated by non - thermal radiations from radio to @xmath0-ray frequencies , that make them the most frequently detected class of extragalactic sources at tev energies . the observed broadband emission",
    "is widely interpreted as arising in a jet of relativistic particles closely aligned to our line of sight ( l.o.s . )",
    "@xcite .    in the widely accepted framework of leptonic synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) radiation , the low - energy bump",
    "is constituted by synchrotron emission from ultrarelativistic electrons accelerated in the jets ; the high - energy component is due to inverse - compton scattering of these synchrotron photons by the same electron population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the bl lacs come in two subclasses : the  low - frequency peaked bl lacs \" ( lbls ) in which the synchrotron peak falls in the ir - optical range , and the  high - frequency peaked bl lacs \" ( hbls ) where it falls in the uv - x - ray bands @xcite . to mark the hbls detected at tev energies from those undetected , we refer to the former as tbls and to the latter as ubls @xcite .",
    "a convenient description of the bl lac seds has been suggested by landau et al .",
    "( 1986 ) in terms of a _ log - parabolic _ ( lp ) model , i.e. , a curved , parabolic shape in a double - log plot .",
    "subsequently , the lp model has been frequently adopted to describe the x - ray spectral continuum in hbls @xcite as well as the tev emission from the tbls @xcite ; it has been also used @xcite to describe bl lac seds in the sub - mm and infrared bands .",
    "such curved spectra are known to arise both by synchrotron or inverse - compton radiations from electron distributions featuring in turn a log - parabolic shape @xcite .",
    "recently , we carried out an extensive investigation of the x - ray synchrotron emission of both tbl and ubl subclasses , based on archival observations carried out by _ bepposax _ , _ xmm - newton _  and _ swift _   between 1997 and 2010 @xcite . on adopting the lp model , the x - ray sed of hbls is described in terms of 3 parameters : the sed peak position @xmath1 ,",
    "its maximum flux @xmath4 evaluated at @xmath1 ( or the corresponding peak luminosities @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 in terms of the luminosity distance @xmath8 ) , and the spectral curvature @xmath9 around @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "comparing the spectral properties of tbls and ubls , we found that : ( i ) the @xmath1 distributions of ubls and tbls are _ similarly _ symmetric around a value of few kevs for both subclasses ; and ( ii ) the x - ray spectral curvature @xmath9 is systematically lower in ubls than in tbls , so that the former feature _ narrower _ spectral shapes @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we compare the x - ray synchrotron luminosities @xmath5 of the tbls and the ubls , as derived from our previous analysis @xcite .",
    "motivated by the observational results recalled above , we interpret both the tbls and ubls @xmath1 distributions in terms of a coherent electron acceleration scenario , and those of @xmath9 as due to accompanying stochastic acceleration .",
    "finally , we provide a relation between the x - ray spectral curvatures @xmath9 and the ic luminosities .",
    "we use cgs units throughout this letter and assume a flat cosmology with @xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the following ,",
    "the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 refer to the observer reference frame , while all unprimed quantities refer to the jet frame .",
    "log - parabolic electron energy distributions ( peds ; i.e. , number of particles per unit volume and lorentz factor @xmath0 ) are generally written in the form @xmath14 , where @xmath0 is the electron lorentz factor , @xmath15 the normalization , @xmath16 the mean particle energy ( i.e. , the peak of @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 the electron curvature parameter .",
    "such peds represent the general solution of the energy and time dependent fokker - planck kinetic equation , that includes systematic ( e.g. , electrostatic or electrodynamic ) and stochastic ( e.g. , turbulent ) accelerations , together with radiative and adiabatic cooling as well as particle escape and injection terms @xcite .    in general ,",
    "both the peak energy @xmath1 and the peak luminosity @xmath5 of a synchrotron sed emitted by a curved electron distribution depend on @xmath19 , the peak energy of the distribution @xmath20 .",
    "but in the case of a log - parabolic spectrum @xmath19 is proportional to @xmath21 itself to imply @xmath22 given that the relation between the curvature parameter @xmath18 of the ped and the homologous @xmath9 of the synchrotron sed reads simply @xmath23 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . then for a typical tbl with",
    "@xmath24 0.3 or ubl with @xmath24 0.7 @xcite the ratio of @xmath19 to @xmath21 is always @xmath25 3 .",
    "distribution of ubls ( red ) and tbls ( black ) .",
    "tbl data do not include mrk 421 and pks 2155 - 304 and the giant flares of mrk 501 and 1h 1426 + 421 @xcite .",
    "the maximal separation @xmath26 between the two cumulative distributions , ( i.e , the ks test variable ) is reported.,width=321,height=249 ]    the synchrotron peak energy @xmath1 is generally proportional to @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the mean magnetic field and @xmath29 the beaming factor @xmath30 , with @xmath31 the bulk lorentz factor in the jet and @xmath32 its opening angle ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". in the case of a log - parabolic ped , this relation simplifies to the proportionality @xmath33 on account of equation  [ eq : gammap ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the synchrotron peak luminosity @xmath5 scales proportionally to @xmath34 when considering variations of the ped , spectral shape @xcite .",
    "but , in the case of log - parabolic peds , for the product @xmath35 obtains , where @xmath36 is the total number of emitting electrons , and @xmath37 is a spectral factor depending only on @xmath18 and ranging from 2.5 to 1.3 for the typical values of spectral curvature of the tbls and ubls , respectively .",
    "we compare the @xmath5 distributions of the two hbl subclasses by performing a ks test , and find that they are indistinguishable at a confidence level of 99% ( see figure [ fig : histograms ] ) . the @xmath5 distribution for the two hbl populations may still differ within one standard deviation . as complementary test",
    ", we simulate the two distributions of @xmath38 with the same number of events ( i.e. , 55 for tbls and 76 for ubls ) , adopting the statistical approach described in massaro et al .",
    "( 2011a ) .",
    "we considered two gaussian simulated distributions , having the same median ( @xmath39(ubls ) = 43.80 and @xmath39(tbls ) 44.17 ) , the same variance ( @xmath40(ubls ) = 0.06 and @xmath40(tbls ) = 0.11 ) of the observed distributions and spanning the same range of @xmath5 .",
    "then , we measured the ks variable , @xmath41 , between the two simulated distributions .",
    "we built the distribution of @xmath41 repeating the simulations 8000 times and we found that the probability to obtain , randomly , the observed @xmath42 is 86% . thus , ubls and tbls have the same @xmath1 and @xmath5 distributions , and differ , significantly , only as for the spectral curvature @xmath9 .",
    "accordingly , we can assume that @xmath21 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 have close values in both tbls and ubls .",
    "then , given the proportionality relations for @xmath5 and @xmath1 written above , these observational results allow to consider a similar number @xmath36 of emitting electrons for both hbl subclasses .",
    "moreover , the impact of limited variations of @xmath5 is softened on @xmath21 and even more on @xmath28 , since we expect @xmath43 ( see section  [ sec : systematic ] ) ; furthermore , the values of @xmath1 are closely the same for the two populations , and so @xmath5 turns out to be proportional to @xmath44 .",
    "the characteristic energy @xmath21 of the ped , simply relates to the synchrotron sed peak energy by @xmath45 as said in section  [ sec : spectra ] , is mainly set by the systematic acceleration component . on the other hand , the stochastic acceleration mechanism is responsible for the curvature @xmath18 of the ped , related to the spectral width @xmath9 .    in the following , we assume the acceleration mechanisms effective in bl lac jets to be a combination of systematic coherent acceleration , responsible for the energy peak position of the ped , and of stochastic acceleration , which accounts for the broadened ped around its peak related to the lower spectral curvature .",
    "we consider inverse compton radiative losses to be subdominant compared to those by synchrotron emission , consistent with the observational lack of inverse compton dominance in the hbl seds , ( e.g. , pks 0548 - 322 , @xcite , 1es 0806 + 524 , @xcite ) , for which any external component appears to be necessary to describe their spectral evolution .",
    "according to @xcite , bl lac jets are likely to be powered by the blandford & znajek ( bz , @xcite ) or the @xcite mechanism ( see also @xcite ) , i.e. , by the extraction of rotational power from a spinning supermassive black hole via the poynting flux associated with the adjacent magnetosphere .    as discussed by the above authors , the simple force - free condition @xmath46 governing these magnetospheres is likely to break down at the jet boundaries , due to considerable electric fields @xmath47 parallel to magnetic field ( e.g. @xcite ) ; such fields are present in the bz configuration , especially at the jet boundary .",
    "alternatively , they may result from magnetic field reconnections in current layers at the jet boundary ( e.g. @xcite ) ; the related systematic acceleration mechanism is primarily electrostatic ( see @xcite for the case of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "however , these electric fields will be electrodynamically screened out by the embedding plasma at distances that exceed the screening length @xmath48 defined by @xmath49 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath50 is the plasma frequency , @xmath21 is the characteristic electron lorentz factor , @xmath51 is the electron mass , @xmath52 its electric charge , @xmath53 the speed of light , and @xmath54 the total electron ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    accordingly ,",
    "the electron energy gained for each acceleration step writes @xmath55 assimilating @xmath56 , from equations [ eq4 ] and [ eq5 ] we obtain the expression for the typical lorentz factor of the accelerated electrons @xmath57    the peak energy @xmath1 of the synchrotron emission for an electron of lorentz factor @xmath58 10@xmath59 falls in the x - ray band , on adopting for the parameters standard values for hbls @xmath60 25 , @xmath61 @xmath62 and @xmath63 1 g ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the maximal energy radiated by an electron with lorentz factor 10@xmath59 is @xmath64 0.05 tev .",
    "then , considering again @xmath65 25 we expect the peak of the inverse compton emission to lie at around @xmath64 0.5 tev .",
    "this is consistent with all tbl observations that have a @xmath0-ray photon index typically 2 or higher in the tev energy range , implying the energy peak of their inverse compton component to lie below a few tevs .    to complete the above scenario ,",
    "the limiting electron lorentz factor @xmath66 attained by an electron corresponds to the condition where the acceleration compensates the radiative ( mainly synchrotron ) losses .",
    "this occurs for @xmath67 at values considerably higher than given by equation [ gammap ] for our standard values of @xmath28 and @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the maximal energy available to the bulk of the electron population is of order @xmath68 @xmath69 1 tev for @xmath70 1 g , in agreement with the observed tev spectral  tail \" of tbls .",
    "finally , we note that lower values of the magnetic field coupled with high doppler factors have also been found to provide good fits of the hbl spectra during high luminous states ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the simplest source condition obtains when the acceleration and the emitting region are cospatial . in particular , we suggest that the emission arises from thin sheaths of thickness @xmath71 that bound the jet with radius @xmath72 , as shown in figure  [ fig : geometry ] . there the particle density is low , and the screening length is sufficiently long as to allow the electrons to attain the required high energies to emit up to tev energies as discussed above .    in this scenario",
    "the relativistic aberration of light concentrates radiation isotropically emitted in the comoving frame into a cone with opening angle @xmath73 , where @xmath31 is the bulk lorentz factor of the jet . on the other hand , only photons emitted within @xmath32 around the l.o.s .",
    "will be detected by the observer .",
    "the typical delay time @xmath74 between two photons emitted simultaneously in the comoving frame from different points on the jet surface is @xmath75 \\simeq 2\\gamma^2 \\frac{l}{c}\\ ] ] the variability timescale @xmath76 consistent with the delay time @xmath77 of the photons in the observer s frame implies an upper limit on the physical length of the emitting region of order @xmath78 this differs from the one usually adopted based on the motion of the jet bulk toward the observer and implying @xmath79 .",
    "such a  flashlight \" effect is analogous to the one presented by ryde & petrosian ( 2002 ) in the case of grbs , but adapted to a cylindrical geometry , and so more like a flash along the jet axis over @xmath80 cm , produced by a relativistic shear instability .",
    "observed variability timescales @xmath81 of order 10@xmath82s imply @xmath83 @xmath69 @xmath84 @xmath69 10@xmath85 cm to hold for a bulk beaming factor @xmath86 25 .",
    "this is also consistent with the synchrotron loss length @xmath87 of order 10@xmath88 cm for an electron with @xmath8910@xmath59 in a field @xmath90 1 g. considering these emitting regions to lie at the base of the jet close to the supermassive black hole central to the agn , the jet radius @xmath84 can match the height @xmath83 ( i.e. , @xmath91 , see figure  [ fig : geometry ] ) .",
    "assuming for the thickness of the effective acceleration and emitting region @xmath9210@xmath93 , the total volume filled by the emitting electrons is @xmath9410@xmath95 @xmath96 , close to the standard values considered for leptonic radiation processes of hbls ( e.g. , @xcite ) .      the observational evidence reported in section [ sec : intro ] that ubls feature systematically",
    "narrower spectra compared to tbls may be interpreted in terms of a less efficient stochastic acceleration occurring in the former s jets .",
    "in fact , the curvature parameter of the ped is related to the stochastic acceleration term in a fokker - planck kinetic equation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and is inversely proportional to the stochastic acceleration rate ; thus the synchrotron seds are relatively broader when the stochastic acceleration is more efficient .",
    "specifically , the ped curvature @xmath18 is directly related to the diffusion coefficient @xmath97 in the fokker - planck kinetic equation by @xmath98 .",
    "higher values of @xmath97 and faster diffusion also imply less time spent in the acceleration region ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in a simple statistical picture ,",
    "@xmath18 is proportional to the energy gain @xmath99 itself , while it is inversely proportional to the number @xmath100 of acceleration steps , and to the variance @xmath101 of the energy gain ; in sum , @xmath102 @xcite . as tbls and ubls",
    "show similar @xmath1 distributions , we can assume that both subclasses have similar values of @xmath28 and of the @xmath103 ratio .",
    "thus higher values of @xmath100 correspond to lower values of @xmath18 ; we suggest such high values of @xmath100 to be comparable with smaller acceleration regions , since each acceleration step is shorter .",
    "so , the observational evidence that @xmath9 is systematically larger in ubls than in tbls is consistent with larger volumes @xmath104 for the former than for the latter .    finally",
    ", we remark that while the average magnetic field is comparable in tbls and ubls , the difference is due to the small scale fluctuations in the power spectrum . on large scales b",
    "is related to the electric field ( see section  [ sec : systematic ] ) which is responsible for the systematic acceleration ; on small scales , a turbulent component gives rise to stochastic diffusion ( see e.g. , brunetti & lazarian 2011 , for a related approach concerning radio volumes ) .",
    "the latter component yields different numbers of acceleration steps in tbls and ubls , but averages out on large scales .    on the other hand , considering that the similarities between the @xmath1 and @xmath5 distributions of tbls and ubls have been interpreted in terms of similar numbers of emitting electrons @xmath36 ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : spectra ] ) , the curvature - volume relation described above suggests that the electron density @xmath105 is larger in tbls than in ubls , making a _",
    "brighter _ inverse compton peak in a ssc scenario .",
    "we conclude that the tbls , not only have _ wider _ x - ray spectra , but are also expected to be _",
    "brighter _ in @xmath0-rays than ubls .",
    "in addition , the diffusion / acceleration timescale is inversely proportional to the diffusion coefficient ; so low values of @xmath97 will correspond to less variable sources .",
    "this feature is also consistent with the lower variability and the lack of giant x - ray flares found in the whole sample of ubls in comparison with the tbls @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , we analyzed and compared the x - ray spectral properties of tbls and ubls , finding that they have _ similar _ @xmath1 distributions , both symmetric around a value of few kevs , while the x - ray spectral curvature @xmath9 is systematically lower in the former .    in this letter , we have compared the @xmath5 distributions of the two hbl subclasses , finding them similar at high level of confidence level .",
    "then ubls and tbls differ mainly as for the spectral curvature @xmath9 ; these observational results likely imply similar numbers @xmath36 of emitting electrons for both subclasses .",
    "we have proposed to interpret the @xmath1 and @xmath9 distributions on assuming that the electron energy gain is due to both coherent and stochastic particle accelerations .",
    "the scenario is based on re - acceleration rather than continuous injection of fresh highly relativistic electrons ; re - acceleration occurs via both systematic and stochastic mechanisms , with equilibrium occurring between the overall acceleration rate and the radiative losses .    describing the coherent acceleration in terms of energy gain from an electric field ,",
    "we have derived a relation for the expected particle lorentz factors @xmath21 @xmath25 10@xmath59 .",
    "thus for a typical hbl with magnetic fields b @xmath691 g , plasma density @xmath106 1 @xmath62 and a beaming factor @xmath29 @xmath69 25 , the expected synchrotron peak energy is at @xmath107 1 kev , as in fact observed in the x - ray seds of hbls @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the stochastic acceleration component is mainly responsible for spectral broadening around @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , the curvature @xmath9 of the x - ray spectra is _ only _ dependent on the stochastic acceleration term in a fokker - planck equation , and thus is inversely proportional to the diffusion coefficient @xmath97 and to the stochastic acceleration rate @xmath108 , that is , @xmath109 .",
    "thus , we interpret the narrow x - ray seds of ubls in terms of less efficient stochastic acceleration compared to tbls .    finally , pursuing the stochastic acceleration scenario we have linked the curvature parameter @xmath9 to the volume of the emitting region , through its inverse proportionality to the number of acceleration steps @xmath100 ( see section  [ sec : stochastic ] ) .",
    "this curvature - volume relation , combined with the above consideration of similar values of @xmath36 , indicates the emitting electron density to be larger in tbls than in ubls , making the inverse compton peak _ brighter _ in the former than in the latter .",
    "thus electron energies sufficiently _ high _ to radiate in the tev range are related to sufficient _ bright _ luminosities for effective detection .",
    "conversely , narrower seds and lower fluxes make ubls harder to detect in the tev range than tbls , in agreement with our previous results concerning their x - ray observations .",
