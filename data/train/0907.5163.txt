    "cross sectional scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) is a sophisticated and extremely valuable nanoscience experimental tool .",
    "it enables , in particular , the manipulation and characterization of individual impurities in semiconductors and metals with unprecedented spatial resolution and electronic sensitivity . in the last few years",
    "this technique has been used to study the electronic and magnetic properties of individual@xcite mn atoms and mn atom pairs@xcite in gaas .",
    "interest in these studies stems in part from the notion that investigating mn dopants in gaas at the atomic scale could lead to a better understanding of and better control over magnetism in diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dmss ) .",
    "recently stm methods were used to substitute individual ga atoms with mn atoms in the first layer of a gaas(110 ) surface.@xcite stm allowed experimentalists to visualize the electronic properties of the acceptor wavefunction bound to the mn position , and to probe the valence - band - hole mediated exchange interactions between two mn atoms.@xcite apart from its possible relevance in probing the basic physics of dmss , this experiment is a remarkable example of how stm techniques can now be employed to engineer novel nanomagnets with specifically designed quantum mechanical properties .    in refs .  [ ]",
    "it was shown that both the mn - induced ( acceptor ) in - gap state and the exchange interaction between mn pairs are strongly anisotropic with respect to crystallographic orientation . a theoretical analysis@xcite based on a tight - binding model of mn atoms in _ bulk _ gaas@xcite reproduces some of these features",
    "qualitatively . nevertheless , it seems clear that the proximity of the mn atoms to the surface must have a significant impact on their properties .",
    "in fact , a more recent study@xcite , in which individual mn atoms were carefully positioned on the gaas(110 ) surface and layer - by - layer on the first few layers below , showed that the reduced symmetry at the surface strongly modifies the wave function of the impurity .",
    "the acceptor wavefunction properties depend on the precise substitutional depth at which the impurity is located .",
    "this experimental conclusion is supported by a recent theoretical study.@xcite in this paper we present a theoretical study of individual mn dopants substituting for ga atoms in a gaas(110 ) surface , or in one of atomic layers below the surface .",
    "our aim is to provide a systematic analysis of how the electronic and magnetic properties of the acceptor wavefunction are modified by the presence of the surface as the mn impurity is inserted into successively deeper layers , and compare with the limiting case of a mn in bulk gaas .",
    "in contrast to previous studies@xcite , we focus on the spin - orbit induced dependence of the acceptor wave function on the direction of the mn magnetic moment orientation .",
    "we compare our surface - influenced results with the results of ref .  ,",
    "in which the dependence of the acceptor wavefunction on the magnetic moment direction was studied for a mn atom in bulk gaas .",
    "our analysis is based on a microscopic tight - binding model , which accounts for the crucial relaxation of the gaas(110 ) surface layer and for spin - orbit interactions in the valence band which play an essential@xcite role in ( ga , mn)as magnetism .",
    "we do not account explicitly for the mn @xmath0-orbitals , but account for @xmath1 hybridization instead by adding an effective exchange interaction between the mn moment and valence band orbitals on nearest - neighbor as sites .",
    "we also include other interaction terms to account for the coulomb repulsion of electrons by the mn ion .",
    "our calculations show that the acceptor wavefunction is in general strongly anisotropic in space ; the detailed anisotropy features depend very strongly on the sublayer in which the impurity is located , in agreement with experiment@xcite and with previous calculations.@xcite for a reasonable choice of the parameters of our model , we find that for a mn located in the topmost layer or in the first subsurface layer , the acceptor state has a large binding energy and a strongly localized wavefunction with a very weak dependence on the mn magnetic moment direction . as the impurity",
    "is inserted deeper beneath the surface , the acceptor wavefunction becomes progressively more delocalized and its dependence on the mn moment orientation increases significantly .",
    "in particular , we find that the ldos feature on the gaas(110 ) surface due to the acceptor level , the quantity which is probed most directly by stm , is noticeably different between the cases of a magnetic moment pointing along the easy and hard magnetic directions when the impurity is located a few monolayers below the surface",
    ". this prediction could be tested in stm experiments in which the direction of the magnetic moment is manipulated with an external magnetic field . we also show that total magnetic anisotropy is related in a simple way to the magnetic anisotropy of the acceptor state and that the magnetic anisotropy landscape depends in a non trivial way on the sublayer in which the impurity is located .",

    "[ results ] we present the results of the model , starting in sec .  [ results_bulk ] with the case of a single mn substituted for ga in bulk gaas .",
    "we then proceed in sec .",
    "[ results_surface ] to discuss a substitutional mn in a @xmath2 surface layer , highlighting emerging features and relating these to experiment .",
    "[ surface_to_bulk ] is devoted to the study of the transition from surface to bulk , in which the mn is placed in successively deeper sublayers below the surface .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions and discuss the implications of our results in sec .  [ conclusions ] . the main text of this paper provides a detailed description of the mn impurity at different depths below the @xmath3 surface layer of the host semi - conductor . some readers may wish to begin by reading the summary and conclusion section , which gives a brief description of our main results , before exploring the main body of the paper .",
    "in a @xmath4as iii - v dilute magnetic semiconductor ( dms ) , the most energetically stable position for the mn is a ga atom site .",
    "this property can be understood as following from the atomic electronic structure of mn , @xmath53d^{5}4s^{2}$ ] , with the @xmath6 electrons allowing for the formation of crystal bonds similar to those between the ga ( @xmath53d^{10}4s^{2}p^{1}$ ] ) and the as ( @xmath53d^{10}4s^{2}p^{3}$ ] ) atoms of the host crystal .",
    "because the mn is missing the 4@xmath7 valence electron of ga , it acts as an acceptor .",
    "the mn ion repels electrons and attracts a weakly bound hole , forming a neutral state.@xcite mn both generates the local magnetic moments ( via the @xmath8 half - filled d - shell ) and acts as a supplier of potentially itinerant holes that can mediate their coupling .",
    "zener s kinetic - exchange @xcite or indirect - exchange interaction applies to systems like ( ga , mn)as in which local moments formed by the magnetic impurities are coupled via itinerant @xmath9- or @xmath7-band carriers .",
    "our study is based on tight - binding model with a hamiltonian @xmath10 that includes a kinetic exchange interaction between the local - moment and the band electrons .",
    "the kinetic - exchange model is appropriate@xcite when the mn-@xmath0 to as-@xmath7 hopping amplitudes ( see below ) are smaller than the energetic separation between the @xmath0-orbitals and the top of the valence band . the band term in eq .  [ hamiltonian ]",
    "is given in terms of the slater - koster parameters@xcite for bulk gaas.@xcite @xmath11 here , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are atomic indices , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are orbital and spin indices , respectively .",
    "the @xmath16 are the slater - koster parameters that do not depend on spin .",
    "the only non - zero parameters are the on - site energies ( @xmath17 @xmath18 ) and the nearest neighbor hopping matrix elements for the @xmath19 @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 orbitals .",
    "our model contains @xmath9 and @xmath7 electrons only , the @xmath0-electrons of the mn enter the model in the form of a mn local moment with spin @xmath23 spin which we treat classically in this paper .",
    "this local magnetic moment is formed by the five @xmath24-electrons of mn that in the tetrahedral host results in bonding and antibonding @xmath25-@xmath0 states in the form@xcite of a triplet of @xmath26-symmetry ( @xmath27-@xmath28- and 3@xmath29-like ) and an occupied doublet of @xmath30-symmetry ( @xmath31- and @xmath32-like ) .",
    "the doublet couples only weakly to the host , and is split from the triplet by the tetrahedral crystal field .",
    "the triplet hybridizes with the connecting @xmath25-orbitals and the weakly bound hole occupies one of the three @xmath25-@xmath0 antibonding states at the top of the valence band , predominantly of as 4@xmath7-character.@xcite the hybridization of the occupied mn 3@xmath0-electrons with the nearest neighbor as 4@xmath7-electrons , cause the @xmath7-states at the top of the valence band with spin parallel to the mn spin to move up in energy relative those that are antiparallel , which hybridize with high - energy unoccupied @xmath0-orbitals .",
    "the direct exchange interaction between holes at the top of the valence band and the mn @xmath0-electrons is weak , such that @xmath7-@xmath0 hybridization dominates which results in an antiferromagnetic coupling.@xcite this physics is captured in the @xmath33 term of ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , which induces an exchange field on the nearest - neighbor as @xmath7-electrons , @xmath34}\\vec{s}_{n}\\cdot\\hat{\\omega}_{m}\\ ; , \\label{exchange}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 ev is the approximate value of the exchange coupling constant inferred from refs .

    "the valence band electronic structure depends on the classical mn spin orientation @xmath42 ( which we parametrized by polar @xmath43 and azimuthal @xmath44 angles ) through the scalar product @xmath45 .",
    "we approximate the spin - orbit coupling hamiltonian @xmath46 by a local atomic one - body operator , in which the spin quantization axis is defined by @xmath47 : @xmath48 where @xmath12 is an atomic index and @xmath49 denotes the renormalized spin - orbit splitting@xcite for which we use the values @xmath50 mev , @xmath51 mev , and @xmath52 .",
    "the spin - orbit term causes the total energy of the system , as obtained by summing the energies of all occupied eigenstates , to depend on the magnetization direction parametrized by @xmath47 .",
    "our procedure allows us to calculate the magnetic anisotropy landscape on the unit sphere and extract the magnetic anisotropy energy as @xmath53 .",
    "the polar coordinate system is defined such that @xmath54 corresponds to the [ 001 ] direction , and with @xmath55 and @xmath56 correspond to the [ 100 ] and the [ 010 ] directions respectively .",
    "the presence of a negatively charged mn ion attracts holes and repels electrons .",
    "we represent the spin - independent part of the effective potential due to mn substitution by a long - range repulsive coulomb part and a mn central cell correction term , @xmath57 the first term in ( [ coulomb ] ) represents the long - range part , which is reduced by the host material dielectric constant @xmath58 to account crudely for weaker dielectric screening at the surface , the dielectric constant for a mn on the surface is reduced to @xmath59 for the affected surface atoms .",
    "the correction term consists of on- and off - site parts , @xmath60 which influence the mn ion and its nearest neighbors respectively .",
    "the on - site coulomb correction is estimated to @xmath61 ev from the ionization energy of mn .",
    "the off - site coulomb correction affects all the nearest - neighbor as surrounding the mn ion and together with @xmath33 ( [ exchange ] ) reflects primarily @xmath7-@xmath0 hybridization physics .",
    "it is one of the most important parameters of the model and its value is set by tuning the position of the mn - induced acceptor level in the bulk to the experimentally observed position@xcite at 113 mev above the first valence band level .",
    "the value thus obtained is @xmath62 ev . in this picture ,",
    "long - range coulomb , exchange and correction interactions all play an important role in determining the character of mn acceptor levels .",
    "we model the electronic structure of gaas with a single substitutional mn by performing a super - cell type calculation with a cubic cluster of 3200 atoms and periodic boundary conditions in either 2 or 3 dimensions , depending on whether we are studying the @xmath2 surface or a bulk - like system .",
    "the @xmath2 surface of gaas is simplified from both theoretical and experimental points of view , by the absence of large surface reconstruction .",
    "relaxation of surface layer positions must nevertheless be included since it removes dangling - bond states that would otherwise obscure the band - gap .",
    "we follow the procedure outlined in refs .  [ ] , in which atomic shifts as deep as the 2nd sublayer are taken into account .",
    "the resulting @xmath2 surface is summarized in fig .",
    "[ relaxfig ] and the top layer and first subsurface layer are depicted in fig .",

    "the most salient feature is an up - shift of the surface as , accompanied by a down - shift of the surface ga .",

    "the rescaling parameter is small and is at most @xmath65    by projecting the eigenvector of the acceptor level onto surface sites obtained after diagonalizing the hamiltonian @xmath66 , we can study the surface ldos , which is intimately related to the topographic stm images.@xcite in our cluster approach we sum the absolute square of the coefficients in the eigenvector corresponding to the ldos on a given atom @xmath13 , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is an eigenvalue index , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are atomic indices , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote orbital and spin respectively . in ( [ projatom ] ) @xmath69 projects out the ldos of atom @xmath70 similarly , we can define operators that project out the orbital and spin character for a given eigenlevel @xmath68 : @xmath71 the procedure we follow in generating ldos plots is similar to the approach used by tang  _ et al . _ in ref .  .",
    "we place gaussians on the atomic positions with a magnitude equal to the ldos of that atom , and a full - width at half - maximum equal to half the nearest neighbor spacing .",
    "( this procedure mimics the finite spatial resolution of an stm tip ) .",
    "in all the ldos plots the normalization is such that the sum of ldos over all atoms in the cluster is unity for a single eigenlevel . when the stm is operating in constant current mode",
    "( see for example ref .  ) , the tunneling current is maintained at a fixed value by varying the tip - surface distance .",
    "the exponential decay of the surface wavefunction causes the distance recorded to depend approximately logarithmically on the ldos at the surface .",
    "we therefore employ a logarithmic color - scale in our images of the ldos .    when imaging states in a semi - conductor band gap at a low bias , it is necessary to move the tip very close to the substrate surface .",
    "this means that interactions between the tip and the sample can cause a change in the surface wavefunction .",
    "in addition , many - body effects beyond those captured by the mean - field description of electronic states outlined above can be important in some cases .",
    "in particular , as detailed below , we find that acceptor levels for mn very close to the surface lie deep in the gap .",
    "stm experiments provide a partial profile of the spatial distribution of added or removed electrons .",
    "when the acceptor is deep in the gap , addition or removal will cause a big change in the potential seen by other electrons .",
    "these various many - body effects are partly captured by our phenomenological model , but we can not expect to find exact correspondence with the experimental images .",
    "our starting point is a single mn in bulk , as represented in our model by placing it at the center of a cubic gaas cluster of 3200 atoms and enforcing periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the dimensions of the cluster ( in the crystalline directions @xmath72\\times\\lbrack1\\bar{1}0]\\times\\lbrack001]$ ] ) used in all calculations are @xmath73@xmath74 or in terms of atomic layers @xmath75 . creating the supercell in the form of a cubic cluster defined by the limiting planes @xmath76 ,",
    "@xmath77 and @xmath78 , enables us to apply periodic boundary conditions in two directions and study the ( 110 ) surface .",
    "the generated cluster can also be given periodic boundary conditions in all three directions to create a bulk system , which should simply be regarded as the fully periodic counterpart of the surface system .",
    "the magnetic anisotropy energy for the fully periodic system as a function of the magnetization direction @xmath79 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ bulkmae ] .",
    "we find bistable minima and an easy axis parallel to the @xmath80001@xmath81 $ ] direction , separated by a single barrier equal to @xmath82 mev .",
    "the anisotropy is very sensitive to the cubic symmetry and the particular easy direction @xmath80001@xmath81 $ ] can be seen as a consequence of the supercell symmetry .",
    "the closest distance between mn in adjacent supercells is 38   along the [ 110 ] and [ 110 ] directions , along which the most prominent hopping path occurs via closely spaced as and ga .",
    "the distance along the 4 other equivalent symmetry directions is much longer , resulting in the observed anisotropy .",
    "scaling down the size of the supercell ( and thereby increasing the effective mn doping ) to 1200 atoms yields an anisotropy of 8.8 mev , and the value increases further as the supercell size is decreased .",
    "we conclude from this calculation that the magnetic anisotropy of a single mn in the bulk of an infinite crystal is much smaller than @xmath83 mev , and that , as far as magnetic anisotropy is concerned , the dilute _ isolated impurity _ limit is achieved only at mn atom fractions @xmath84 much smaller than @xmath85 , and much smaller than what can be represented in this or any other supercell calculation .",

    "[ bulkldos ] reveals much higher values of the ldos .",
    "the cut of the mn plane in the easy direction ( fig .",
    "[ bulkldos ] ( a ) ) has 6% of the spectral weight of the acceptor wavefunction on the mn atom , a total of 15.4% on the 4 nearest neighbors as and the rest is spread out in the lattice .",

    ". in both cases model parameters were adjusted to give the correct energetic position for the bulk mn acceptor level .",
    "the difference in wavefunctions demonstrates that satisfying this criterion does not guarantee that the character of the acceptor level is correctly captured .",
    "in particular , accounting for the contribution to binding from longer ranged coulomb interactions lead to more extended wavefunctions at a given acceptor energy .",
    "the observed correlation between spatial anisotropy and mn spin direction agrees qualitatively with previous calculations@xcite , in which a decrease of 90% in maximum spectral weight at the center of the ( 110 ) plane images is seen four layers away from the mn ( corresponding to fig .",

    "the source of this difference in the behavior of the ldos between odd and even layers away from the mn , is that the odd layer maximum is on the as and the even layer maximum is on the ga in the nearest neighbor hoping path along the [ 110 ] .",
    "this effect becomes pronounced three layers away from the mn and higher . although the actual percentages differ somewhat , the same strong anisotropic behavior of the acceptor wavefunction as in ref .",
    "[ ] is observed .",
    "the strong dependence of the ldos on mn spin - orientation , combined with the weak magnetic anisotropy , implies that the observed ldos should be strongly sensitive to external magnetic fields .",

    "as the acceptor wavefunction detaches from the surface with increasing depth , the extension towards the surface becomes reduced and it begins to extend along [ 110 ] ( not shown in this sequence of images as the extension along [ 110 ] is parallel to the line of sight ) .",

    "[ subcuts ] ( b)-(e ) ) , the ldos on the ( 110 ) surface displays a characteristic triangular shape with one vertex pointing down in the [ 001 ] direction . as the mn is inserted into yet deeper layers , the triangular shape evolves into shape resembling a butterfly or bow - tie , with stronger _ upper _ wing .",
    "these features have been observed experimentally@xcite and found in agreement with tb calculations@xcite similar to ours .",
    "it is interesting to notice that for a mn in bulk , calculated cross - section ldos on ( 110 ) plane located @xmath68 atomic layers from the mn shows a similar butterfly shape , but with a stronger _ lower _ wing.@xcite our calculations for bulk mn shown in fig .",
    "[ bulkldos ] displays a similar tendency  see in particular fig .",

    "this symmetry reversal of the bow - tie shape with respect to the [ 001 ] direction for a mn close to the surface has been ascribed to the intrinsic strain associated with the buckling relaxation.@xcite the change of the mn - induced ldos from a triangular to a bow - tie shape as the impurity is inserted into deeper layers below the ( 110 ) surface occurs after sublayer 5 , where the magnetic anisotropy landscape starts to develop a quasi - easy plane .",
    "the mn spin is now free to explore the easy - plane ( 110 ) , with in more spectral weight in the [ 110 ] direction in the mn layer below the surface .",
    "we now proceed with a more quantitative evaluation of fig .",
    "[ subcuts ] .",
    "the ldos of the first sublayer ( fig .",
    "[ subcuts ] ( a ) ) is highly localized with a maximum spectral weight on the surface as of 50% .",
    "the mn , one layer below , has only 8% spectral weight .",
    "the change in the ldos with the mn spin direction is minute and the resulting very low variations in orbital and spin character yield a low anisotropy energy .",
    "it is clear that the rising anisotropy in sublayer 2 and below is associated with a generally more spread out acceptor wavefunction . in sublayer 2 ( fig .",
    "[ subcuts ] ( b ) ) , the hole is now much more spread out than at the surface and subsurface , and it shows that a large part of the extended spectral weight lodges at the surface . in sublayer 1 and 2 there is little change between the hard and easy direction , and in sublayer 3 and 4 the maximum spectral weight going from the hard to the easy direction , decreases by 14% and 33% . in sublayer 5 ( fig .",
    "[ subcuts ] ( e ) ) , where the maximum anisotropy energy is reached , the easy direction surface ldos instead becomes more pronounced and the maximum ldos decreases by 60% from the easy to the hard direction .",
    "there is clearly something special about sublayer 5 , where the surface has a high impact on the anisotropic extensions of the acceptor wavefunction .",
    "in addition to the large change in magnitude between the hard and easy directions when the mn is in this particular layer , the surface ldos begins to show a qualitative change . in sublayer 6 ( fig .",
    "[ subcuts ] ( f ) ) , at which the high and low barriers are first interchanged , the wavefunction again shows a stronger surface ldos in the hard direction . as we move further below the surface , the ldos maximum decreases by around 40% as the mn spin reorients from the hard to the easy direction . at the deepest level in sublayer 9 ( fig .",
    "[ subcuts ] ( i ) ) the quasi - easy ( 110 ) plane has formed , and the surface ldos maximum abruptly drops 82% between the hard and easy direction . the general trend in acceptor wavefunction character as layer depth",
    "is increased is that the surface ldos is decreases and extends more along the [ 110 ] direction , running below the surface .",
    "although the surface ldos is biased on the [ 001 ] side of the mn , the patterns are consistent with the fact that the wavefunction tends to extend along directions perpendicular to the mn spin . in the hard directions ( where the mn spin is in the [ 111 ] or the [ 110 ] )",
    ", we therefore consistently see more spectral weight on the [ 001 ] side of the mn relative the easy direction ldos , and a more pronounced bow - tie like pattern . for the deeper levels where",
    "the low barrier has dropped significantly , thermal and quantum fluctuations , as well as mn - mn interactions in the sample can cause the mn spin to fluctuate in the ( 110 ) plane , such that the bow - tie shape becomes more pronounced .",
    "the small inset in fig .",
    "[ subcuts ] ( i ) shows the ldos at the surface when the mn spin is in the [ 001 ] direction , which has the familiar slightly asymmetric bow - tie shape .",
    "this solution is very close in energy to the easy direction , only 1 mev higher . for deep impurities ,",
    "the wavefunction is essentially dominated by the subsurface extension along the [ 110 ] , such that the mn spin can move across the low barrier in the ( 110 ) plane . comparing with the fully periodic system , where the wavefunction extends equally along the [ 110 ] and the [ 110 ] in the ground state",
    ", we see that the effect of the surface on the deep impurities is to reduce the extension along the surface normal , such that reversal paths open up in the single barrier for bulk ( see fig .  [ bulkmae ] ) .",
    "it is also noteworthy that in sublayer 5 , the low and the high barrier has not yet interchanged , but are comparable in energy .",
    "the ldos at the surface when the mn spin is pointing in the direction of the lower barrier is larger than the ldos in the easy direction , then following the same qualitative pattern as all the other depths .",
    "this indicates that the wavefunction is very sensitive to the level dynamics as the gap between the highest occupied and the acceptor level closes in .",
    "the odd behavior of sublayer 5 is associated with a quasi - degeneracy between the highest occupied and the acceptor level , as indicated by the large variations 5 - 50 mev of the gap between them ( see fig .",
    "[ sublevels ] ) .",
    "this sensitive situation , causes a large total amount of spectral weight to be shifted on and off the surface between the hard and easy direction , such that large variations in orbital and spin character occur , yielding the high anisotropy .    in fig .",
    "[ ldosdistributions ] the acceptor level ldos values on all 3200 atoms are sorted in size and then plotted on a logarithmic scale .",
    "note that what is shown is not a continuous curve illustrating a parameter dependence but 3200 closely spaced points , one for each atom .",
    "the reason that the values have been sorted in size is that we are only interested in the possible magnitudes of the atomic ldos here .",
    "there is no spatial information in this plot , but it shows how the ldos magnitides are spread over the population of atoms .",
    "the sum of the ldos values is normalized to unity .",
    "this plot demonstrates that an increased depth of the mn is associated with a delocalization of the acceptor wavefunction , which manifests itself as a large population of atoms with increased spectral weight .",
    "as the mn depth increases a large population of atoms emerges with approximately 2 - 3 orders of magnitude larger ldos relative the highly localized surface set .",
    "the surface ( marked 0 ) and the first sublayer ( marked 1 ) exhibit similar distributions , with a localized signature and a larger spectral weight in the very narrow high end limit on the far right . for the surface and subsurface ,",
    "the bulk of the spectral weight is located in close vicinity to the mn , which results in a large population of atoms with a much lower ldos in the range @xmath108 . for sublayer 3 and deeper ,",
    "the majority of atoms show increased weight in the approximate range @xmath109 .",
    "this large population represents atoms farther away from the mn core region , which means that the acceptor wavefunction is becoming much more extended away from the surface .",
    "the spatial spread of the acceptor wavefunction is connected with the variations in orbital and spin character .",
    "[ orbstats ] shows the maximum and minimum orbital and spin down character on the unit sphere of the mn magnetic moment directions as a function of mn depth for the acceptor level .",
    "layer 0 ( the surface ) and layer 1 ( the subsurface ) show little variation .",
    "the difference between maximum and minimum orbital character rapidly increases from sublayer 3 and reach high values in sublayer 5 and 6 , where the anisotropy energy is also large .",
    "as we move further down , the orbital @xmath7-characters level out towards a 25% maximum and minimum difference . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ sublevels ] the acceptor level comes very close to the highest occupied level in sublayer 5 , leading to a quasi - degeneracy between these two levels in the hard direction .",
    "this leads to a large anisotropy energy , as the quasi - degeneracy is lifted and the total energy lowered , when the mn spin is pointing in the easy direction .",
    "associated with this quasi - degeneracy , is a mixing of the two levels and a change in the nature of the acceptor wavefunction .",
    "this change manifests itself as large fluctuations in orbital and spin character of the wavefunction in sublayer 5 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ orbstats ] .",
    "the quasi - degeneracy between the acceptor and highest occupied level in sublayer 6 , is also related to the change in orbital and spin character responsible for the interchange of the high and low barriers as we go from sublayer 5 to 6 ( see fig .",
    "[ subanis ] ( e - f ) ) . the spin - down character variation ( fig .",
    "[ orbstats ] ( c ) ) increases steeply in sublayer 2 and reaches a maximum in sublayer 4 , after which the difference drops quickly towards 5% .",
    "the anisotropy is also quite high in sublayer 4 , but the orbital character variations are not as large as in sublayers 5 and 6 .",
    "however , looking at the variations in spin - down character , we see that there is a sharp maximum on sublayer 4 .",
    "this points to the crucial impact of small spin character fluctuations of the acceptor level on the magnetic anisotropy energy .",
    "[ ldosdistributions ] and [ orbstats ] show that the acceptor wavefunction delocalizes with depth , leading to larger variations in orbital and spin character as the spread increases .",
    "because of the surface , the variations in spin and orbital character are related to the geometry of the system that is responsible for redistribution of the ldos between the hard and easy directions .",
    "the total redistribution is very large for the maximal anisotropy layer , essentially depleting the surface ldos in the hard direction to the advantage of the ldos in the easy direction .",
    "we have undertaken a study of the properties of a single mn embedded in a large 3200 atom gaas matrix .",
    "our model is based on a kinetic - exchange tight - binding hamiltonian that accounts for the polarization of the as @xmath7-electrons nearest neighbors of a mn spin via an off - site exchange term , and includes the local atomic spin - orbit interaction as well as the coulomb field from the mn ion .",
    "the relaxation of the ( 110 ) surface was taken into account since it plays an essential role@xcite in the ( 110 ) surface electronic structure . in agreement with previous calculations@xcite",
    "we find that the acceptor wavefunction is generally highly dependent on the mn spin direction .",
    "an exception occurs for the cases of surface and subsurface layer mn spin locations , for which we find a highly localized acceptor wavefunction that does not spatially redistribute as the mn spin changes direction .",
    "we find , in particular , that a single mn in the ( 110 ) surface produces a highly localized acceptor - level wavefunction and that the level lodges deep in the gap due to the loss of coordination at the surface .",
    "a deep acceptor level at the surface is also found in experiment@xcite , although uncertainly about band - bending effects has been responsible for some confusion as to its energetic position .",
    "the anisotropy of the surface state is relatively low , as expected for a deep - gap state .",
    "the actual depth of this state in our model depends sensitively on a purely phenomenological parameter in our calculation , the off - site coulomb correction , which needs to be reduced relative to its bulk value in order to reproduce the experimentally observed position in the gap .",
    "the acceptor level spatial structure is probed experimentally via the ldos contributions to the surface layer . as the mn is placed in deeper subsurface layers ,",
    "the surface ldos first displays a triangular pattern , which then evolves into an asymmetric butterfly or bow - tie shape when the mn is located still further from the surface .",
    "this finding is in qualitative agreement with experiment.@xcite we find in addition that the anisotropy energy grows with depth , as the acceptor wavefunction becomes more extended .",
    "the magnetic anisotropy easy direction is strongly affected by the surface , and we find that its presence tends to favor [ 111 ] as an approximate easy direction . the observed easy axis is associated with a tilt of the wavefunction due to the up and down shift of the surface as and ga atoms . this symmetry is responsible for the triangular pattern on one side of the mn and persists to deep layers , after which the mn spin becomes more free to move across the surface normal . by comparing a three - dimensionally periodic calculation with the corresponding wide surface slab calculations",
    ", we see that for the deeper mn , the effect of the surface is to open up additional reversal paths in the bulk mn impurity s single - barrier magnetic anisotropy landscape .",
    "this is because at the deepest layers , the ground state solution yields an acceptor wavefunction that is suppressed along the surface normal [ 110 ] , relative to the fully periodic system .",
    "the deep layer wavefunction extends instead most strongly along the [ 110 ] direction , such that a quasi - easy [ 110 ] plane is formed . a strong magnetically and spatially anisotropic state",
    "is found in sublayer 5 , where a quasi - degeneracy between the acceptor and highest occupied level leads to a large anisotropy energy and a large shift of the ldos at the surface between hard and easy directions .",
    "our predictions can in principle be checked experimentally by manipulating the mn magnetic moment direction with an external magnetic field . as a function of the mn depth",
    ", effects could be visible as early as the third sublayer , where our calculations indicate that the surface - layer ldos for magnetization along the [ 111 ] hard direction should be larger than the surface layer ldos when the magnetization is along the easy direction [ 111 ] . in sublayer 3 and 4",
    "the maximum ldos  decreases by 14% and 33% from the hard to the easy direction .",
    "the acceptor level becomes increasingly shallow with increasing mn layer depth and approaches the valence band in sublayer 5 .",
    "we observe a strong signature in sublayer 5 . at this point",
    "the surface - layer ldos is instead larger for magnetization along the easy direction , with a 60% decrease in maximum ldos from the easy to the hard direction .",
    "it should be noted however , that this situation depends very sensitively on the local environment since this signature is associated with a quasi - degeneracy between the highest occupied level and the acceptor level .",
    "for instance , increased mn doping can affect the layer index at which this change occurs . in sublayer 6 , the high and the low barriers have interchanged , with the high barrier now in the [ 110 ] direction parallel to the surface . at this point",
    "the easy direction is still approximately the [ 111 ] , but it then moves towards [ 110 ] with further increased depth .",
    "in addition to a large 40% decrease in the maximum ldos from the hard to the easy direction , our calculations indicate that a more symmetric bow - tie shape appears in the hard direction for layer 6 and deeper .",
    "the mn spin - orientation can be influenced by thermal and quantum fluctuations as well as by external magnetic fields .",
    "we will address the influence of quantum fluctuations in a subsequent publication , and comment here only on the interplay between external fields and thermal fluctuations . at temperatures higher than the anisotropy energy the mn spin orientation will be randomized by interactions with its thermal bath .",
    "the measured surface - layer ldos should then correspond to an average of the results obtained here for particular orientations . at low - temperatures",
    "thermal fluctuations become unimportant and the magnetization orientation will depend on a competition between zeeman coupling and magnetic anisotropy .",
    "as we have explained , the surface - layer ldos pattern provides an indirect fingerprint of the magnetization orientation .",
    "our experimental predictions for the depth dependence of magnetic anisotropy can be tested by identifying the zeeman - coupling strength required to change the surface - layer ldos .",
    "for example we predict that for mn in deeper layers there are high magnetic barriers of the order 10 mev , which implies that large magnetic fields are required to reorient the mn spin to the hard directions .",
    "these high barriers for a single mn suggests that it might be possible to engineer few - atom substitutional mn impurity clusters near the gaas surface which act like nanomagnets with attractively large magnetic blocking temperatures .",
