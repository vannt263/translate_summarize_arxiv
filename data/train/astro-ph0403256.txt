    "recent cosmological measurements strengthen the evidence from type  ia supernova redshift - magnitude measurements ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al .  1999 ) that the energy density of the current universe is dominated by einstein s cosmological constant @xmath0 , or by a dark energy term in the cosmic stress - energy tensor that only varies slowly with time and space and so acts like @xmath0 .",
    "these measurements include : ( 1 ) more recent type  ia supernova redshift - magnitude measurements ( see , e.g. , knop et al .",
    "2003 ; barris et al .  2004 ) ; ( 2 ) the space - based wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) measurement of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy , with some input from other measurements ( see , e.g. , page et al .  2003 ; spergel et al .  2003",
    "; scranton et al .",
    "2003 ) ; and ( 3 ) other measurements of cmb anisotropy , which indicate the universe is close to spatially flat ( see , e.g. , podariu et al .  2001b",
    "; durrer , novosyadlyj , & apunevych 2003 ; melchiorri & dman 2003 ) , in combination with the continuing strong evidence for low non - relativistic matter density ( chen & ratra 2003b and references therein ) .",
    "see peebles & ratra ( 2003 ) , padmanabhan ( 2003 ) , bernardeau ( 2003 ) , steinhardt ( 2003 ) , and carroll ( 2004 ) for reviews of the current state of affairs .    while einstein s @xmath0 was the first example of dark energy , nowadays much attention",
    "is focused on scalar field models in which the energy density slowly decreases with time and so behaves like a time - variable @xmath0 ( see , e.g. , peebles 1984 ; peebles & ratra 1988 , 2003 ; padmanabhan 2003 ; steinhardt 2003 ; carroll 2004 ) .",
    "a simple scalar field dark energy model has scalar field @xmath1 potential energy density @xmath2 at low redshift , with @xmath3 ( see , e.g. , peebles & ratra 1988 ; ratra & peebles 1988 ) .",
    "podariu & ratra ( 2000 ) , waga & frieman ( 2000 ) , and gott et al .  (",
    "2001 ) examine constraints on this model using type  ia supernova redshift - magnitude data .",
    "they find that a broad range of @xmath4 is consistent with the supernova data .",
    "it is important that these dark energy models be tested by other independent methods .",
    "the redshift  angular - size test is one option .",
    "indications from current data , while not as compelling as those discussed above , are consistent with a significant dark energy density at low redshift ( see , e.g. , daly & guerra 2002 ; zhu & fujimoto 2002 ; chen & ratra 2003a ; podariu et al .  2003 ; jain , dev , & alcaniz 2003 ; jackson 2003 ) .",
    "future higher - quality data should turn this into a much more precise cosmological test .",
    "the redshift - counts test also appears to be on the verge of becoming a very promising test ( see , e.g. , newman & davis 2000 ; huterer & turner 2001 ; podariu & ratra 2001 ; levine , schulz , & white 2002 ) .",
    "statistical analyses of strong gravitational lensing can be used to provide constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "fukugita , futamase , & kasai ( 1990 ) and turner ( 1990 ) note that the rate of gravitational lensing increases rapidly with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "ratra & quillen ( 1992 ) and waga & frieman ( 2000 ) study gravitational lensing in the inverse power - law potential scalar field dark energy model .",
    "the recently completed cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class ) is the largest uniform survey for strong lensing ( myers et al .",
    "2003 ; browne et al .",
    "the survey has discovered 22 cases of multiple - imaging ( that are induced by galaxy - scale lens potentials ) out of @xmath5 extragalactic radio sources .",
    "a subsample of 8958 sources containing 13 multiply - imaged sources satisfy well - defined observational selection criteria and is referred to as the class statistical sample ( browne et al .",
    "the class statistical sample has been used to constrain cosmological parameters ( see , e.g. , chae et al .  2002 ; chae 2003 ; kuhlen , keeton , & madau 2004 ; mitchell et al .  2004 ) as well as to constrain global properties of galaxies ( chae 2003 ; davis , huterer , & krauss 2003 ) and galaxy evolution ( chae & mao 2003 ) .",
    "the lensing - based constraints on cosmological parameters are consistent with those based on type  ia supernova magnitude - redshift data but have larger statistical errors .    in this work we use the class statistical sample to constrain the inverse power - law potential scalar - field dark energy model ( peebles & ratra 1988 ) .",
    "in linear perturbation theory , a scalar field is mathematically equivalent to a fluid with time - dependent equation of state parameter @xmath6 and speed of sound squared @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the pressure and energy density , and the dot denotes a time derivative ( see , e.g. , ratra 1991 ) .",
    "the xcdm parametrization of this dark energy model approximates @xmath10 as a constant , which is accurate during the radiation and matter dominated epochs but not in the current , scalar - field dark energy dominated epoch .",
    "this xcdm approximation thus leads to inaccurate predictions for the gravitational lensing considered here , which probes the low redshift universe .",
    "we emphasize , however , that unlike a lot of earlier work , we do not work in the xcdm approximation , instead we explicitly integrate the scalar - field dark energy equations of motion .    in @xmath112",
    "we summarize the data and method used .",
    "results are presented and discussed in @xmath113 .",
    "we use the data listed in chae ( 2003 ) except for the following modifications owing to the very recent spectroscopic observations of several class lens systems by mckean et al .",
    "the 13 lens systems in the class statistical sample ( table  1 of chae 2003 ) are 0218 + 357 , 0445 + 123 , 0631 + 519 , 0712 + 472 , 0850 + 054 , 1152 + 199 , 1359 + 154 , 1422 + 231 , 1608 + 656 , 1933 + 503 , 2045 + 265 , 2114 + 022 , and 2319 + 051 . from mckean et al .",
    "( 2004 ) we adopt the following lens redshifts @xmath12 , 0.620 , and 0.588 respectively for 0445 + 123 , 0631 + 519 , and 0850 + 054 .",
    "we also use the finding by mckean et al .",
    "( 2004 ) that the lenses for 0445 + 123 and 0631 + 519 are early - type galaxies while that for 0850 + 054 is a spiral - type galaxy .",
    "sheth et al .  ( 2003 ) directly estimate the velocity ( dispersion ) function ( vf ) of early - type galaxies based on the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data ; a correction to their normalization is reported in mitchell et al .",
    ". it would be desirable to use the sheth et al .",
    "( 2003 ) vf for lensing analyses .",
    "however , we find a posteriori that the maximum likelihood for the sheth et al.(2003 ) vf is far worse than that for the chae ( 2003 ) inferred vf based on the second southern sky redshift survey ( ssrs2 ) .",
    "this implies that the ssrs2 vf is more consistent with the image separations in the class statistical sample ( chae 2004 , in preparation ) . in this work",
    "we use the ssrs2 vf as in chae et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , chae ( 2003 ) , and chae & mao ( 2003 ) .",
    "we use the method of statistical analysis of lensing described in chae ( 2003 ) except we now work in the spatially - flat scalar - field dark energy cosmological model ( peebles & ratra 1988 ) . in particular , as in chae ( 2003 ) we assume that the comoving number density of early - type galaxies is constant from @xmath13 to the present epoch and the characteristic velocity dispersion for @xmath14 is not assumed known a priori but determined from the image - splitting sizes of the multiply - imaged systems . and einstein s @xmath0 is assumed , the class data are consistent with non - evolution of early - type galaxies since @xmath13 . ] here we briefly review essential concepts in lensing statistics ( chae 2003 ) and the spatially - flat scalar - field dark energy cosmological model ( peebles & ratra 1988 ) . let the differential probability for a cosmologically distant source to be multiply - imaged with image - splitting size @xmath15 to @xmath16 by a lens at redshift @xmath17 to @xmath18 be @xmath19 and the probability of multiple - imaging be the integral of @xmath19 over @xmath15 and @xmath17 . then for a statistical sample that contains",
    "@xmath20 lensed sources and @xmath21 unlensed sources , the likelihood @xmath22 of the observation given the statistical lensing model including the background cosmology is @xmath23 the differential and integrated lensing probabilities depend both on the properties of galaxies and on the underlying cosmological model through proper time element and angular - diameter distances ( see , e.g. , chae 2003 ) , so that the above likelihood has dependence on cosmological parameters under consideration .",
    "the action for the scalar - field model of peebles & ratra ( 1988 ) is given by @xmath24,\\ ] ] where ` natural units ' ( i.e.  @xmath25 ) are adopted , the planck mass @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is newton s gravitational constant ) , @xmath28 is the lagrangian density for matter and radiation , and @xmath29 and @xmath3 are the parameters characterizing the scalar - field inverse power - law potential energy density . for a spatially flat cosmological model equation  ( 2 )",
    "yields the following equations of motion : @xmath30 ,   \\nonumber \\\\ p_\\phi & = & \\frac{m_p^2}{32\\pi}[(\\dot{\\phi})^2- \\kappa m_p^2 \\phi^{-\\alpha}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where dots denote derivatives with respect to time , @xmath31 is the cosmological scale factor , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are respectively the energy density and pressure of @xmath34 .",
    "cosmological quantities in the above model are computed through a combination of numerical integration , tabulation , and interpolation .",
    "specifically , we numerically integrate the equations of motion given by equation  ( 3 ) to compute @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the proper time normalized by the hubble time ( see  2.1.2 of chae 2003 ) .",
    "we compute and tabulate the values of @xmath35 in the 3-dimensional grid spanned by @xmath37 , @xmath4 , and @xmath17 .",
    "then the value of @xmath35 for any @xmath37 , @xmath4 , and @xmath17 is obtained by interpolation and the angular - diameter distance between two redshifts is obtained as usual by the trivial numerical integration of @xmath38 .",
    "figure 1 shows the class lensing - based constraints on the parameters of the spatially - flat inverse power - law potential scalar field dark energy cosmological model .",
    "the likelihood is maximized for @xmath39 and @xmath40 , i.e. , a conventional cosmological constant . at 68% confidence ,",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 . would be @xmath43 .",
    "see  2 and chae ( 2004 , in preparation ) for why we choose to use the ssrs2 vf .",
    "] however , at 95% confidence both @xmath44 and @xmath45 are allowed . as mentioned in  2 ,",
    "these results are based on the assumption that the comoving number density of early - type galaxies is unchanged from @xmath13 .",
    "however , if there were fewer early - type galaxies at intermediate redshifts compared with the present epoch , the maximum likelihood estimate of @xmath37 would become lower and the confidence ranges for @xmath4 and @xmath37 would become narrower .",
    "the above results are consistent with , but not as constraining as , those derived from type  ia supernova redshift - magnitude data ( podariu & ratra 2000 ; waga & frieman 2000 ) .",
    "they are also consistent with , but more constraining than , those determined using measurements of angular size as a function of redshift ( chen & ratra 2003a ; podariu et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that various disparate data sets give consistent constraints on the inverse power - law potential energy density scalar - field dark energy model that weakly favor the conventional cosmological constant over a dynamical scalar field dark energy .",
    "however , current results are tentative and future much larger data sets are required to resolve this issue . future lensing data ( e.g. ,  class2 ; see  6 of chae 2003 ) would be valuable in this respect and are eagerly anticipated .",
