    "new - physics scenarios ( np ) based on very heavy virtual quanta exchanges can be described , below the direct production threshold , by effective , contact - interactions that can can have only _ indirect _ signatures by contributing corrective terms to the standard model ( sm ) amplitudes , suppressed by some power of the ratio between the collider c.m .",

    "these corrections will reveal themselves _ via _ deviations of the measured observables from the sm predictions or , in few specific cases , by the observation of processes forbidden by the sm .    in principle",
    ", different kinds of np interactions may produce similar deviations and , consequently , it would be desirable to assess , for each non - standard model , not only the `` discovery reach '' , represented by the maximal value of the relevant mass scale below which a deviation can be observed at a given c.l . within the experimental accuracy but , also , the `` identification reach '' , defined as the upper limit of the mass range of values for which the model can be discriminated from the other potentially competing scenarios .",
    "we will focus on the discrimination reach on the add models of gravity in large , compactified , extra spatial dimensions @xcite , with respect to the four - fermion contact interactions inspired by compositeness @xcite , and _ viceversa _ , looking at the differential cross sections of @xmath1 with @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ; @xmath4 ) , at the ilc with longitudinally polarized beams @xcite . in ref .",

    "to estimate the level at which it may be discriminated from other , in principle competing np scenarios ( `` tested '' models ) , for any values of the relevant mass parameters , say example one of the four - fermion ci models ( [ ci ] ) , we introduce relative deviations of the differential cross section ( denoted by @xmath35 ) from the add predictions due to the ci in each angular bin , and a corresponding @xmath36 function : @xmath37 here , @xmath38s represent the expected relative uncertainties , which combine statistical and systematic ones , the former one being related to the add model prediction .",
