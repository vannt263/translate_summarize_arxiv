    "during the last few years there has been a renaissance of the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) approach @xcite in its original minkowski space formulation .",
    "it is caused by the progress in finding new methods which allow to overcome the difficulties resulting from the singularities of the bs equation and to obtain solution in the minkowski space both on- and off - mass shell .",
    "the on - shell solution , found few decades ago @xcite , allows to compute the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) scattering phase shifts and parametrize the nn - interaction .",
    "the off - shell solution for the bound @xcite and scattering states @xcite is much more recent and allows to properly calculate the electromagnetic elastic @xcite and transition form factors describing the electro - disintegration of a bound system ( e.g. the deuteron ) .",
    "note that the euclidean solution can not be used for that purpose , since the wick rotation can be done in the bs equation itself , but not in the integral expression giving the form factors @xcite .",
    "the full bs program has been achieved for a nn system interacting via separable kernel @xcite since in this case , the singular integrals  both in the equation and in the form factors  are performed analytically .",
    "however it is not yet fully realized for a field - theoretically inspired description . for one - boson exchange kernel the analytical treatment of singularities is also possible due to the fact that the bound state bs solution is found in the form of the nakanishi integral representation . in this case",
    "one can also calculate the integrals analytically and express the form factor @xcite through the non - singular nakanishi weight function @xcite . for",
    "the scattering states the development of this method ( based on the nakanishi representation @xcite ) is in progress @xcite but did not yet enter in the stage of numerical calculations . on the other hand ,",
    "we have recently developed a different approach @xcite based on the direct treatment of the singularities and which allows to find both the bound and scattering state solutions .",
    "the direct treatment of singularities is required also when calculating the transition form factors . in the present work",
    "we briefly explain our approach to this problem and present the first numerical results . in absence , for the time being , of scattering state solutions in the nakanishi form , our method is the only one that allows to calculate this quantity .",
    "we consider in this contribution only the case of spinless particles .",
    "the non - zero spin case complicates the algebra but do not change the singularities of the propagators .",
    "let us start with the expression for the transition current , represented graphically in figure [ triangle ] . @xmath0",
    "[ ( p'-k)^2-m^2+i\\epsilon]}.\\ ] ] the plane wave contribution will not be considered in this short presentation .",
    "the quantities @xmath1 and @xmath2 are respectively the initial ( bound state ) and final ( scattering ) vertex functions .",
    "@xmath2 is the half - off - shell s - wave scattering bs amplitude found in . like any scattering amplitude",
    ", @xmath2 depends on the initial and final four - momenta satisfying the conservation law .",
    "therefore , the expression ( [ ffin0 ] ) depends on the four - momenta @xmath3 ( excluding @xmath4 from the conservation law ) or alternativley on @xmath5 and @xmath6 . for a given partial wave , say s - wave , we average it over the angles of the vector @xmath7 in the c.m",
    ". frame of the final state where @xmath8 .",
    "after that the four - vector @xmath9 does not enter in the decomposition of @xmath10 , though the result depends on the module @xmath11 which we will still denote as @xmath9 .",
    "it determines the final state mass @xmath12 .",
    "therefore we have in our disposal the four - vectors @xmath13 only .",
    "notice also that in the approximation given by fig .",
    "[ triangle ] , restricted to the one - body electromagnetic current for the interaction of photons with constituents , the current @xmath10 is not conserved , that is @xmath14 .",
    "it can be decomposed as : @xmath15 in this situation , one can chose one of the two following strategies : ( _ i _ )  find both @xmath16 and @xmath17 and use the current ( [ ffa ] ) , in spite of its non - conservation , to calculate the electro - disintegration cross section ; ( _ ii _ )  start with ( [ ffa ] ) and construct the conserved current @xmath18{$\\cdot$}}\\tilde{j})=\\left[(p_{\\mu}+p'_{\\mu})+ \\frac{({m_f}^2-m_i^2)}{q^2}(p'_{\\mu}-p_{\\mu})\\right]f(q^2)\\ ] ] which satisfies to @xmath19{$\\cdot$}}j=0 $ ] ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) . due to the constraint",
    "@xmath19{$\\cdot$}}j=0 $ ] , the current @xmath23 is determined only by the form factor @xmath24 , and this is the quantity that will be calculated below . the form factor @xmath25 , if at all necessary , can be obtained analogously .",
    "it is convenient to carry out the calculations in the system of reference where @xmath26 ( i.e. @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are collinear ( i.e. , they are either parallel or anti - parallel to each other , depending on the @xmath30 value ) . in the elastic case ,",
    "this system coincides with the breit frame @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath26 . in the inelastic case ,",
    "since one still has @xmath26 , the three - momenta are different @xmath33 .",
    "this frame can be obtained by performing a lorentz transform from the breit frame .    using this reference frame ,",
    "the form factor @xmath24 can be computed by taking the zero component of the current : @xmath34 that is : @xmath35 [ ( p'_0-k_0)^2-e_{\\vec{p'}-\\vec{k}}^2+i\\epsilon]},\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the on - shell energy ( and similarly for other energies ) .",
    "this 4d integral is in practice a 3d one , since the azimuthal integration gives simply a factor @xmath37 . to calculate it numerically , we treat the singularities in a similar way to what was done for solving the scattering states bs equation @xcite .",
    "namely , we represent each of three propagators as the sum of the principal value ( pv ) integrals and the @xmath38-function contributions , that is , symbolically : @xmath39    the non - zero contributions result from the terms containing two , one and zero @xmath38-functions . performing explicit integrations of the @xmath38-functions , we get , correspondingly , the sum of 1d , 2d and 3d pv integrals . to treat the pole singularities in the @xmath40 variable in the pv integrals ,",
    "we introduce a function @xmath41 which has the same pole singularities  and only them  and the same residues as the integrand of ( [ ffin1 ] ) , once ( [ pvdelta ] ) being inserted .",
    "we perform usual subtraction technique in the integrand with @xmath41 in such a way that the difference is smooth function and can be safely integrated numerically .",
    "since the function @xmath41 is the sum of a few pole terms only , its integral is calculated analytically .",
    "all other singularities ( the vertex functions @xmath42 , or in @xmath43 variable , after integration over @xmath40 ) are logarithmic or weaker and therefore can be also integrated numerically , though with some care . in this way we can properly treat the singularities in the integral ( [ ffin1 ] ) and calculate the transition form factor .",
    "the details of this calculation will be given in a subsequent publication @xcite .",
    "as a test of our calculation we have considered the case @xmath44 .",
    "we used the two - parameters feynman parametrization to calculate analytically the 4d integral ( [ ffin0 ] ) .",
    "the resulting integral is calculated analytically over one feynman parameter and numerically over the second one .",
    "we took small value of @xmath45 in the denominator of ( [ ffin0 ] ) and obtained a stable result relative to variation of @xmath45 . in this way , we reproduced both real and imaginary parts of the transition form factor vs. @xmath30 found by the method described above .",
    "taking @xmath46 , we reproduced the ( real ) elastic form factor .",
    ".,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    .,scaledwidth=90.0% ]",
    "we present the results corresponding to the one - boson exchange model with the constituent mass @xmath47 , exchange boson mass @xmath48 and the coupling constant @xmath49 , providing a bound state with the mass @xmath50 .",
    "the initial bound state bs amplitude @xmath1 and the final scattering state amplitudes @xmath2 have been obtained by the method described in @xcite . using these solutions , the transition form factor @xmath24",
    "was calculated by the methods presented above .",
    "its real and imaginary parts vs. @xmath30 for the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . for these kinematical parameters",
    "the form factor is almost real ( like the elastic form factor ) since the final mass is very close to the initial one .    for @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) and for the same values of other parameters",
    "the transition form factor is shown in fig .",
    "now , for considerably larger inelasticity ( i.e. , for larger effective final state mass ) , the imaginary part of form factor is comparable with its real part . in our calculations , we have no restrictions for the values of momentum transfer @xmath30 and the final state mass @xmath55 .",
    "several aspects remain to be clarified , like e.g. the relative importance of the plane wave graph and the dependence on the binding energy of the initial state .",
    "the solutions of bethe - salpeter equation in the natural minkowski metric are difficult by the singularities presented in the integral equation and in the solution itself .",
    "the euclidean solutions are much more easy to get but they are not suitable for obtaining the scattering amplitudes as well as the electromagnetic and/or transition form factors due to the impossibility to perform the wick rotation in the corresponding integral expressions .    a series of works have been undertaken in the last years to overcome this difficulty .",
    "they had the aim of safely obtaining the minkowski solutions for bound and scattering states @xcite and compute the elastic electromagnetic form factor @xcite .",
