    "the structure of a cluster is one of its primary properties and one which has been intensely studied , experimentally and theoretically @xcite . however , there is still much to be learnt about the fundamentals of cluster structure and the possible structures that can be formed . for atomic clusters with pair interactions , it is relatively well - understood how the form of the potential determines the observed structure .",
    "for example , the effects of the width of the potential well @xcite and oscillations in the potential @xcite have been systematically studied . however , for the systems that are of most interest , the interatomic interactions are usually much more complex . in particular , metal clusters , which are of great technological relevance @xcite ,",
    "have a strong many - body character to their bonding .",
    "this presents a number of challenges to our understanding of cluster structure in metals .",
    "first , there is the possibility that new types of structure could emerge as a result of many - body effects .",
    "although , the structural types observed for pair potentials are also frequently observed for metals , e.g.  the competition between icosahedral , decahedral and close - packed structures is also common for metals @xcite , there are an increasing number of intriguing exceptions .",
    "one seemingly common feature for small metal clusters is to exhibit structures with no discernible order @xcite .",
    "however , it might be that the disorder is a result of new structural principles that can not be fully satisfied at the sizes considered ( hence the disorder ) , but which could lead to novel high symmetry structures at certain magic sizes @xcite . indeed , there are general grounds to expect high symmetry structures to emerge irrespective of the potential @xcite",
    ". studies that just reoptimize known cluster structures will of course miss such new features , and so it is important that efficient global optimization algorithms are used .",
    "secondly , the many - body character makes it increasingly difficult to relate the observed structure back to the interactions , even when the assumed form for the many - body potential is relatively simple .",
    "there has been some interesting progress recently in this area , namely into the causes of the disordered structures @xcite , and the effect of the range of the attraction and repulsion on the competition between icosahedral , decahedral and close - packed clusters @xcite , but there is much still to be discovered .",
    "this task is particularly important because of the difficulty in producing good empirical metal potentials ( it is not feasible to study the sizes in which we are interested in any other way ) .",
    "one needs this kind of physical insight to understand the strengths and deficiencies of a potential and how it could be improved .",
    "it would also help one to discriminate between different potentials that purport to model the same material but give rise to different structures .",
    "lead clusters illustrate some of these challenges .",
    "the first theoretical study on large clusters by lim _",
    "_ using a glue potential seemed to indicate that the most stable clusters at relatively small sizes ( from at least @xmath2 ) are face - centred cubic ( fcc ) @xcite , the preferred bulk structure @xcite .",
    "this conclusion was based on a comparison of the energies of a series of mackay icosahedra and fcc cuboctahedra .",
    "it is quite unusual to see bulk structures already being favoured at such small sizes , but this finding was rationalized on the basis of the particularly small value of @xmath3 , the ratio of the surface energies of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 faces @xcite .",
    "usually , the mackay icosahedra have an energetic advantage at small sizes , because exclusively having @xmath5 facets gives them an appreciably lower surface energy .",
    "furthermore , these results were not inconsistent with the experiments in the literature at that time , which were mass spectroscopic studies on very small lead clusters @xcite , and electron diffraction experiments on very large clusters , which were identified as fcc , but with possibly some vestiges of amorphous structure @xcite .    this basic picture",
    "though has recently been challenged by both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite results . electron diffraction of clusters from 3 to 7@xmath6 nm indicates that the largest clusters are dominated by decahedra , but for the smaller clusters it was not possible to obtain an adequate fit to the diffraction pattern , suggesting that alternative structural models need to be considered @xcite .",
    "simulations of the melting and freezing of large lead clusters ( modelled by the glue potential used by lim _",
    "@xcite ) unexpectedly revealed that for a certain size range ( @xmath7 , at least ) fcc structures are not lowest in energy @xcite .",
    "instead , a new type of icosahedral structure , which is more stable than the fcc structures , spontaneously formed both on freezing and on heating at temperatures just below that for melting .",
    "similar structures had been previously seen in some simulations of large lead clusters but it was not recognised that they could be lowest in energy @xcite .",
    "they resemble anti - mackay icosahedra @xcite , which have a mackay icosahedral core but with most of the outer layer in ` hexagonal close - packed ' ( hcp ) surface sites rather than the ` fcc ' sites that would continue the packing in the mackay icosahedra .",
    "these results naturally raise intriguing questions about the structures of small lead clusters .",
    "what alternative structural models might be needed to understand the experimental results ?",
    "do lead clusters , as modelled by the glue potential , really favour fcc structures at small sizes ?",
    "et al . _ clearly showed that other standard forms were not lower in energy , so the structures would have to be somewhat unusual .",
    "interestingly , a simple analysis using macroscopic properties as inputs suggested that lead would be a particular likely candidate for disordered clusters to be low in energy @xcite .    here , we address some of these issues by performing global optimization for lead clusters with up to 160 atoms .",
    "we pay particular attention to characterizing the structures of these clusters and to understanding why the potential favours the lowest - energy structures .",
    "to model the lead clusters we use a glue potential @xcite of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a short - ranged pair potential , @xmath10 is a many - body glue function and @xmath11 is a `` generalized coordination number '' for atom @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath11 is defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an `` atomic density '' function .",
    "these three functions have been fitted for lead using a variety of bulk and surface properties @xcite .",
    "the use of surface energies is particularly important for the application of this potential to model clusters . as well as clusters ,",
    "this potential has been also used to model the surface reconstructions and pre - melting of low - index lead surfaces @xcite , and lead nanowires @xcite .",
    "the choice of this empirical potential is motivated by the need for computational efficiency in order that global optimization is feasible for the sizes we consider here , and by our intention to compare with previous results .",
    "the use of _ ab initio _ electronic structure methods for lead is prohibitively expensive , especially as relativistic effects would need to be included to obtain reasonable results @xcite .",
    "for example , sophisticated density functional calculations are unable to reproduce the experimental surface energies and anisotropies @xcite .    the three functions that make up the lead glue potential : ( a ) @xmath9 , @xmath14 and ( b ) @xmath10 . the pair distances and @xmath11 values in the 13-atom decahedron",
    "are also plotted as impulses , with the heights proportional to the number that take that value.,width=317 ]    the functions @xmath10 , @xmath9 and @xmath14 are displayed in figure [ fig : potential ] .",
    "the pair potential has a very shallow well and so most of the binding energy comes from the glue term .",
    "the glue term has been chosen to have its minimum at @xmath15=12 , consistent with the designation of @xmath15 as an effective coordination number .",
    "the form of @xmath14 is particularly significant .",
    "as @xmath14 decreases relatively slowly with increasing @xmath16 beyond the minimum in the pair potential , next - nearest neighbours make a significant contribution to @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , the difference in surface energies between the @xmath5 and @xmath4 faces is small because , although an atom on a @xmath5 face has fewer nearest neighbours , it has more next - nearest neigbours @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath14 then decreases relatively rapidly to zero at the cutoff at @xmath17 , which typically occurs between the second and third neighbour shells .    for a pair potential",
    "the pair distances are the most important quantities .",
    "for example , the lowest - energy structure of a cluster involves a balance between maximization of the number of nearest neighbours , whilst minimizing the strain energy that results from nearest - neighbour pair distances deviating from the equilibrium pair value , @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "however , for a glue potential , such as the current one , where the main contribution to the energy is from the glue function , the most important quantities are the @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , one of the key factors in generating a low - energy structure is to have the @xmath11 values as close as possible to @xmath19 , the value of @xmath15 at the minimum of @xmath20 .",
    "this can potentially lead to different ordering principles than for pair potentials .",
    "only structures that have their nearest - neighbour pair distances close to @xmath18 are generally competitive for pair potentials .",
    "however , this constraint is relaxed for glue potentials , and particularly when , as in the current case , @xmath14 initially falls off weakly with @xmath16 .    for the atoms on the surface of a cluster @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , there will be a driving force for contraction of the surface to make the pair distances for the surface atoms smaller and hence their @xmath11 larger . at equilibrium",
    "the surface contraction will be balanced by the increase in energy due to the resulting compression of the cluster core .",
    "these considerations represent a particular problem for some of the usual forms for atomic clusters , such as the mackay icosahedra and to a lesser extent decahedra . the inherent strain in these clusters results in pair distances between surface atoms that are longer than @xmath18 , and so the compression needed to increase @xmath11 for the surface atoms is particularly large .",
    "therefore , these traditional structural forms are expected to become increasingly disfavoured by potentials for which the pair separation depends strongly on coordination number @xcite . instead",
    ", novel forms that are able to obtain large @xmath11 values for the surface atoms , whilst not having too large an energetic penalty for compression of the cluster interior , could potentially be lowest in energy .",
    "the global optimization of the lead clusters was performed using the basin - hopping @xcite ( or monte carlo minimization @xcite ) approach .",
    "this method has proved particularly successful in locating putative global minima for a wide variety of cluster systems @xcite .",
    "the optimization task becomes rapidly more difficult with increasing @xmath22 ( e.g.  the number of minima on the potential energy surface is thought to scale exponentially with @xmath22 @xcite ) and so , of course , the possibility that we have not been able to obtain the true global minimum increases .",
    "however , the structural principles and trends are clear from our results .",
    "the energies and point groups for the putative global minima are given in table [ table : gmin ] .",
    "point files will be made available online at the cambridge cluster database @xcite .",
    "the energies of the global minima are represented in figure [ fig : egmin ] in such a way that makes particularly stable clusters stand out .",
    "all clusters in the range @xmath24 are depicted in figure [ fig : pbsmall ] and a selection of particularly stable larger clusters in figure [ fig : pbbig ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as flagged in the introduction , an important aim of this paper is not only to characterize the global minima for this lead potential , but to understand how the observed structures relate back to the form of the potential .",
    "we start by examining the decahedral 13-atom global minimum , for which the @xmath25 and @xmath11 values have been included in figure [ fig : potential ] .",
    "it is noticeable that there is a significant dispersion of nearest - neighbour distances .",
    "in fact the longest distance is 11.7% longer than the shortest , which compares to a 2.3% difference for the same structure when optimized for the lennard - jones potential .",
    "as expected from the discussion in section [ sect : methods ] , the structure distorts to move the @xmath11 values as close to @xmath19 as possible , rather than keeping the nearest - neighbour distances near to the minimum of the pair potential .",
    "this is achieved by an expansion along the fivefold axis and a contraction of the equator of the cluster .",
    "this reduces the @xmath11 values for the two vertex atoms on the fivefold axis , but increases the @xmath11 values for the other ten surface atoms , while maintaining the @xmath11 value for the central atom close to @xmath19 .",
    "a similar anisotropy of the pair distances has previously been noted by lim _",
    "_ in their analysis of the lead cuboctahedra @xcite ; there is a greater contraction for the @xmath4 faces of the cuboctahedra than the @xmath5 faces because of the enhanced contribution to @xmath11 from next neighbours across the diagonals of the squares on the @xmath4 faces .    to understand why novel structural forms are observed for this lead potential ,",
    "we take pb@xmath26 as an example and compare the contributions to the energy from a series of competing structures ( table [ table : edecomp ] and figure [ fig : analyse ] ) .",
    "the global minimum is based on the 54-atom structure illustrated in figure [ fig : pbbig ] but with an additional surface atom .",
    "also possible at this size are a fcc cuboctahedron , an ino decahedron and a mackay icosahedron .",
    "a comparison of the properties of the 55-atom global minimum ( gmin ) to the fcc cuboctahedron ( @xmath27 ) , the ino decahedron ( @xmath28 ) and the mackay icosahedron ( @xmath29 ) , the same four clusters as in table [ table : edecomp ] .",
    "( a ) the atomic energies , @xmath30 , for each atom in the cluster .",
    "the atoms have been ranked by their distance from the centre of mass , with atom 1 being the closest to the centre .",
    "( b ) @xmath31 .",
    "( c ) @xmath32 . , width=317 ]    in table [ table : edecomp ] we have decomposed the pair energy into two components : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the number of nearest neighbours , @xmath35 is the depth of the pair potential , and @xmath36 is the energetic penalty for distances that deviate from @xmath18 , the distance corresponding to the minimum of the pair potential .",
    "more formally , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a distance criterion that distinguishes nearest from next - nearest neighbours .",
    "for all the structures we consider , there is a clear separation between these coordination shells .",
    "as expected the pair energy only contributes a small fraction of the total energy .",
    "it is also noticeable that @xmath36 is of similar magnitude to @xmath39 .",
    "this is in marked contrast to what occurs for pair potentials , where minimization of the strain energy is a key element of a structure s stability .",
    "@xmath36 for the global minimum is particularly large .",
    "although the pair energy is small in magnitude , it is structure sensitive and so it can still determine the relative stabilities of structures when the energies from the glue term , @xmath40 , are similar .",
    "for example , the major component of the difference in energy between the 55-atom cuboctahedron and decahedron is the greater pair energy of the cuboctahedron .",
    "it is clear from table [ table : edecomp ] that the global minimum s stability is a result of its significantly lower glue energy , which is a result of the atoms being able to achieve @xmath11 values that are closer to the ideal value , @xmath19 .",
    "however , this lower glue energy is partially offset by the higher pair energy resulting from the distortion of the pair distances that is necessary to achieve an increase in @xmath11 .",
    "if we look at the atomic contributions to the energy ( table [ table : edecomp ] and figure [ fig : analyse](a ) ) it is clear that the lower energy results from a lower average energy for the surface atoms ( particularly atoms 1333 in figure [ fig : analyse](a ) ) , which outweighs the somewhat less favourable energies for the atoms in the interior of the cluster .",
    "it is also interesting to understand what structural features of the global minimum lead to the larger value of @xmath41 .",
    "we analyse this in figure [ fig : analyse](b ) and ( c ) , first by looking at the cumulative contribution to @xmath41 from pairs with distances less than @xmath16 : @xmath42 it is particularly interesting to note that @xmath43 for the global minimum only becomes largest beyond 4.926 . therefore , although the contribution to @xmath41 from distances beyond this distance is small in magnitude , it is key in stabilizing the global minimum relative to the more conventional forms .",
    "we can analyse this further by considering @xmath32 , the number of pairs of atoms that are separated by less than @xmath16 .",
    "it can be seen from figure [ fig : analyse](c ) that the number of pair distances within the radius of the cutoff distance for @xmath44 is significantly larger for the global minimum than for the competing structures , which in turn correlates with the larger value of @xmath45 .",
    "however , this is only true because the cutoff is located between the second and third coordination shell .",
    "the cuboctahedron , decahedron and icosahedron all have a relatively narrow distribution of nearest - neighbour distances , which leads to a clear distinction between the second and third coordination shell .",
    "by contrast , the global minimum has a much more disperse nearest - neighbour shell and hence there is no clear distinction between a second and third neighbour shell . instead",
    ", there is a steady increase in @xmath32 beyond the start of the second neighbour shell .",
    "although the above analysis has been presented for a single cluster , repeating this procedure for other sizes has confirmed the generality of the conclusions .",
    "we have shown by the locating the global minima for small lead clusters interacting with a many - body potential of the glue form that , contrary to the original conclusion of lim _ et al .",
    "_ , these clusters do not adopt fcc geometries for @xmath23 .",
    "instead , they form a series of novel structures that are a consequence of the many - body character of the potential .",
    "these results naturally lead one to wonder at what size bulk - like fcc structures will develop . to help us answer this question we have plotted in figure [ fig : e_large ] the energies of the global minima , alongside those for a number of sequences of high - symmetry structures and the novel icosahedral forms that hendy obtained by simulations of freezing @xcite and by construction @xcite .     a comparison of the energies of the global minima and the new icosahedra discovered by hendy @xcite , to series of high - symmetric structures , which include mackay and anti - mackay icosahedra , cuboctahedra , truncated octahedra ( with regular hexagonal @xmath5 faces ) , ino decahedra and marks decahedra .",
    "the energies are measured with respect to @xmath46 .",
    ", width=317 ]    the figure confirms that the icosahedra and decahedra are always higher in energy than the best fcc structures ( except at the smaller sizes considered in the last section ) and that the fcc truncated octahedra become slightly lower in energy than the cuboctahedra @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , we can clearly see that both the global minima we have found and the new icosahedra produced by hendy @xcite are significantly lower in energy than the best fcc clusters .",
    "thus , extrapolations between these two sizes ranges @xcite suggest that fcc clusters might well not be the lowest in energy for intermediate sizes , and hence that fcc clusters are not lowest in energy until at least @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "this is a surprising result , for although it is not uncommon to find small ( @xmath48 ) metal clusters that do not exhibit any of the usual cluster structures , it is unprecedented for this behaviour to persist up to such large sizes .",
    "the results are also relevant to the ongoing issue of disordered metal clusters . like recent theoretical results for gold @xcite , cadmium , zinc @xcite and vanadium @xcite",
    "many of our global minima do not fit with the fcc , hcp , decahedral and icosahedral structures that are often found for close - packed materials .",
    "however , to call these lead clusters disordered would be too strong because , although most of the clusters for @xmath49 have no overall stuctural order , there are common local structural preferences which at a few sizes result in highly symmetric ordered structures that are particularly stable .    for pair potentials ,",
    "clusters tend to retain a lattice structure away from the magic numbers , because it is unfavourable for the pair distances to deviate significantly from the equilibrium value .",
    "for example , most small lennard - jones clusters can be considered to be based upon mackay icosahedra , either with an incomplete outer layer or covered by an ordered overlayer @xcite . by contrast , for metal clusters the many - body character of the bonding can make it favourable to break the lattice structure away from the magic numbers so that the atoms can ( in the language of the current potential ) increase their effective coordination numbers ( @xmath11 s ) . a structure with no overall order results .",
    "therefore , if one only examines a few cluster sizes the presence of particularly stable ordered structures may be missed .    from our analysis of the energetics of the competing structural forms we have seen that the shape of @xmath14 , in particular the shoulder and the position of the cutoff , is key to the stability of the novel structures that we find to be lowest in energy .",
    "this dependence on the cutoff is somewhat worrying both because it is a rather long - range feature of the potential and because its position is not physically motivated , but chosen more for computational convenience .",
    "these results illustrate how sensitively cluster structure depends on the potential ; the correct determination of the relative energies of competing clusters is a stringent test of any potential @xcite .",
    "our results also help us to understand the structures exhibited by lead nanowires @xcite modelled using the same potential .",
    "were surprised at the apparent contradiction between the non - fcc character of their nanowires and the cluster results of lim _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and so suggested a number of reasons for the differing structural tendencies .",
    "however , our results show that the non - fcc character is common to both systems .",
