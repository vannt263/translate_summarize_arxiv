    "in recent years , the study of long range correlations in experimental data has moved into the focus of interest .",
    "whereas a large amount of empirical results has been obtained using detrended fluctuation analysis @xcite , the same information is , in principle , also contained in the power spectrum .",
    "observations of nontrivial power law decays of the power spectrum have a long tradition and are usually denoted by @xmath2-noise , or , more precisely , @xmath0 with @xmath3 .",
    "examples include noise in electric resistors , in semiconductor devices ( flicker noise ) , and fluctuations in geophysical data @xcite .",
    "by weak ergodicity breaking one describes the behavior of a system which is ergodic in the sense that a single trajectory is able to explore completely some invariant component of the phase - space ( it is indecomposable ) , but where the invariant measure is not normalizable , so that the time scales for this exploration might diverge ( in other words , there is no finite microscopic time scale ) .",
    "this concept goes back to bouchaud @xcite .",
    "a consequence of this is that time averages computed on a single ( infinite ) trajectory will not converge to the ensemble mean . instead , the time average is a random variable itself , as a function of the initial condition of the trajectory , which is drawn from a distribution with non - zero variance .",
    "it has been shown that continuous - time random walks @xcite , but also specific deterministic dynamical systems @xcite exhibit this behavior",
    ". a natural consequence of it is the non - existence of a finite correlation time , reflected by a power law decay of the auto - correlation function , which translates itself into a @xmath0-behavior of the power spectrum .",
    "this type of spectrum has been derived for a two state process of this type by margolin and barkai ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 33 ) ) .",
    "as said , the crucial aspect of systems with weak ergodicity breaking is that a time average in the limit of an infinite trajectory does not converge to a sharp value but is a random variable with a distribution of finite width .",
    "this should also hold for the power spectrum .",
    "therefore , it is not evident that an estimation of @xmath1 from a numerically computed power spectrum of a single trajectory is reliable .",
    "we therefore investigate the estimation of the power spectrum from single realizations of a specific process with weak ergodicity breaking .",
    "a relevant remark is necessary : if one estimates the power spectrum by a discrete fourier transform from a time series with sampling interval @xmath4 ( i.e. , uses the periodogram ) , then the variance of the estimator @xmath5 for the power contained in the @xmath6th discrete frequency is @xmath7 .",
    "however , if the correlations in the time domain decay exponentially fast , then the errors in adjacent frequencies @xmath5 and @xmath8 are sufficiently weakly correlated such that the error of a _ binned _ spectrum where one takes averages over @xmath9 adjacent frequencies decays like @xmath10 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sect.13.4 ) . in the limit of an infinite time",
    "series , the estimation error of the binned power spectrum of an ergodic process therefore decays to zero , i.e. , the spectrum assumes uniquely defined values . in the following , we will discuss results for binned power spectra of processes with weak ergodicity breaking .",
    "the binning implies that in the analytical calculations we are allowed to ignore the time discretization which is present in every numerical data analysis .",
    "the next sections are devoted to an analytical derivation of the fact that the binned power spectrum of a weakly non - ergodic process is a random variable whose distribution has a non - zero variance .",
    "in addition , we compute the correlations between different bins .",
    "we will show that because of these correlations , further binning can not reduce the uncertainty about the true power , and moreover , that the whole uncertainty about the power spectrum reduces to a random normalization factor .",
    "this has the important consequence that the power law exponent @xmath1 can indeed be estimated numerically regardless of the difficulties to estimate the spectrum itself .    in section [ sectionnumericalsimulations ]",
    "we illustrate the analytical ( asymptotic ) results by numerical simulations , also opposing time averages to ensemble averages .",
    "note that because of the long range correlations , cutting a long trajectory into pieces and treat these as an ensemble is not valid , since this ensemble would not represent an independent sample of initial conditions .",
    "rebenshtok and barkai introduced the following model for a thermodynamic system showing weak ergodicity breaking @xcite : in its simplest form it is characterized by two distributions , one waiting time distribution with density @xmath11 and one distribution of an observable @xmath12 according to the probability density @xmath13 . in the model let @xmath14 be i.i.d .",
    "random variables distributed according to @xmath13 and let @xmath15 be i.i.d . waiting times distributed according to @xmath11 .",

    "we assume that the first four moments of @xmath13 are finite , i.e. , @xmath23 moreover , we assume that the distribution is centered , i.e. , @xmath24 .",
