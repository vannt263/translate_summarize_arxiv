    "complete genome sequencing and the analysis of the binding of transcriptional regulators to specific promoter sequences have uncovered the global organization of the gene transcriptional regulatory network in well - studied organisms such like _ escherichia coli _",
    "@xcite and yeast _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _  @xcite .",
    "the gene network describes a directed relationship - regulation - between different genes , and its architecture is characterized by broad connectivity distributions  @xcite , over - representation of selected motifs  @xcite , and so on .",
    "these features are rarely found in random networks , probably being the consequence of evolutionary selection . therefore illuminating the functional characteristics associated with those discovered structural features can help trace back their origins . in this work ,",
    "we show heterogeneous connectivity can facilitate the balancing between dynamical stability and instability .",
    "both robustness and evolvability are essential for living organisms , which achieve their specific phenotype by their gene expression program  @xcite .",
    "thus the transcriptional regulatory network should be organized in a way that supports the coexistence of these apparently contradictory properties and from this perspective , it has been proposed that the gene network should be at the boundary between stable and unstable phases , called the edge of chaos  @xcite .",
    "the question then arises : what are the characteristics of the network architecture that can support the requirement to be located at the edge of chaos ?",
    "a simple model incorporating recently available information turns out to be useful to answer this question .",
    "the kauffman model  @xcite was used in the past to study the gene network dynamics which is far from completely known because of its complexity . in this model",
    ", each node has a boolean variable , @xmath4 or @xmath5 , the discretized expression level , evolving regulated by other @xmath6 nodes according to the quenched rules that are randomly distributed with a parameter @xmath7 .",
    "in spite of these simplifications involved , the model revealed detailed relations between the dynamical stability against perturbations and the network architecture  @xcite .",
    "moreover , distinct attractors in the configuration space are considered as corresponding to different cell types in a given organism and thus its scaling with the number of genes ( nodes ) across different organisms has been of great interest  @xcite .",
    "empirically , the number of cell types scales as the square - root of the number of genes , and the same scaling relation was believed to hold between the number of attractors and the number of nodes in the kauffman model at the critical point @xmath8 , supporting the hypothesis that living organisms should be between order and chaos  @xcite .",
    "recently , however , it was found that under - sampling effects may hamper numerical enumeration of distinct attractors  @xcite and further investigations demonstrated that the total number of attractors grows faster than any power law with the system size  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it was also reported that attractors stable against deviation from synchronous update show a sub - linear scaling behavior  @xcite .",
    "recent investiations of real gene networks suggest generalization of the original kauffman model .",
    "first , the distribution of the regulating rules is structured showing a bias towards the canalyzing functions  @xcite .",
    "second , the number of links or degree is not constant but different from node to node , resulting in broad degree distributions  @xcite . in the gene regulatory networks of _ e. coli _",
    "@xcite and yeast  @xcite , the distributions of out - degree ( number of target genes for each regulator ) and in - degree ( number of regulators for each target gene ) were not delta - functions but shown to take power - law or exponential - decaying form , respectively , although true asymptotic behaviors were hard to discern due to finite size effects . while the effects of the structured distribution of regulating rules have been intensively studied  @xcite , it remains to show how the heterogeneous connectivity affects the dynamical stability  @xcite .",
    "we consider the kauffman model on directed networks with general in- and out - degree distributions and compare two evolving dynamical configurations by computing their hamming distance , to determine whether a given network is dynamically stable ( zero distance ) or unstable ( non - zero distance ) against perturbations .",
    "the critical point of the boolean networks with power - law degree distributions was studied recently  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we show quantitatively how the hamming distance behaves near the critical point , which will provide a deeper understanding of the critical phenomena of boolean networks with heterogeneous connectivity patterns and insights into the interplay of structure and dynamics in living organisms .",
    "the hamming distance for infinite system size ( thermodynamic limit ) can be computed by the method presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and we here present a detailed description of the method along with a discussion on the effects of correlation between in- and out - degree of the same node . then , more importantly , we extend the method to derive the hamming distance for finite system size , which enables us to check the analytic predictions with numerical simulation results .",
    "our main result is that for in - degree distributions with a diverging second moment the hamming distance increases very slowly when moving from the phase boundary towards the unstable phase and the width of the boundary in finite - size systems is very broad .",
    "this indicates that strongly heterogeneous genetic networks have a large capacity to stay at the edge of chaos when their structural and functional organization is subject to variation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "this deviation seems to be rooted in the use of the annealed approximation for the hamming distance .",
    "it has been reported that the analytic prediction of the critical point in the framework of the mean - field theory deviates slightly from the numerical analysis in the ising model  @xcite and in the kuramoto model for synchronization phenomena  @xcite .",
    "an improvement can be made by considering the cayley tree with a given degree distribution as the underlying network topology  @xcite .",
    "our results show that the width of the critical regime @xmath227 in the @xmath48 axis increases as the in - degree exponent @xmath3 decreases below @xmath117 while its scaling behavior remains the same for all @xmath148 . since the number of genes in most organisms is not infinite but of order @xmath228 at most , the width of the critical regime may be between @xmath229 and @xmath230 , depending on the in - degree exponent .",
    "such a broad critical regime for small values of @xmath3 should help living organisms to remain in the critical regime and in turn , to balance between robustness and evolvability .",
    "individual dynamical responses depend on the properties of the perturbed elements , i.e , , on their connectivities and regulating rules , which leads to perturbation propagation on various scales in heterogeneous networks  @xcite . here",
    "we have analyzed the whole ensemble of such differentiated dynamical responses in heterogeneous networks and found that it can remain critical more easily with the help of extremely heterogeneous connectivity patterns .",
    "the effects of correlation between in- and out - degree of the same node , which we have ignored so far , can be addressed in the results we obtained . in presence of the in- and out - degree correlation ,",
    "@xmath231 should be considered instead of @xmath91 to compute the hamming distance , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr ] ) .",
    "if it holds that @xmath232 for large @xmath38 , we have to consider the effective in - degree exponent , @xmath233 , in place of @xmath3 for power - law in - degree distributions in all the results we obtained , including the scaling exponents in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : beta ] ) and ( [ eq : mu ] ) .",
    "in summary , we investigated the phase transition between the stable ( ordered ) and unstable ( chaotic ) phase in the boolean dynamical network .",
    "heterogeneous connectivities are found to broaden substantially the small hamming distance region close to the phase boundary by suppressing the perturbation propagation in the unstable phase .",
    "furthermore the transition region for finite system sizes turns out to be much wider than in homogeneous networks .",
    "such a robust pseudo - criticality is expected to be also present in transcriptional regulatory networks and also in other biological networks such as neural networks  @xcite , which can be a source for stability and evolvability coexisting in living organisms .",
    "our results suggest that the heterogeneous connectivity patterns of many biological networks have been selected in the course of evolution in part to serve for achieving stability and evolvability simultaneously",
    ". therefore it would be desirable to propose a model in which heterogeneous connectivity patterns emerge driven by the evolutionary pressure towards a broad edge of chaos .",
    "there are indeed models for co - evolution of network structure and dynamics , which reproduce networks with a selected number of links supporting dynamic criticality by dynamics - correlated addition and deletion of links  @xcite . similarly to these models , if one allows link rewiring only , preserving the total number of links , and make it happen depending on the network s dynamical state , the network is expected to be organized so as to have a broad degree distribution , which is under investigation .",
    "while we focussed on the hamming distance to capture the effects of structural features on the dynamic stability of boolean networks , it would be also interesting to see how the heterogeneous connectivity patterns affect the properties of attractors in the configuration space , given the recent interests  @xcite in the scaling behavior of the number and length of the attractors in the critical boolean networks .",
    "it has been shown that the median attractor length of sf networks is larger than that of networks with fixed in - degree at the critical point  @xcite , but much more properties remain to be investigated .    the asymptotic behaviors of the in - degree distributions of real transcriptional regulatory networks of _ e. coli _  @xcite and yeast  @xcite are hard to discern due to finite size effects . in both organisms , there are about one hundred regulators ( nodes with outgoing links ) , which impose a cut - off in the measured in - degree distributions .",
    "however , one can find for the network of yeast that its in - degree distribution is much broader than that of the networks generated by randomly rewiring the links , and that the hamming distance of the boolean dynamics is much slower than that in the randomized networks , demonstrating the contribution of heterogeneous connectivity pattern to maintaining dynamic criticality  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the real transcriptional regulatory networks and other biological networks have much richer structural properties than described here and their relation to the dynamic criticality of the system is of interest .",
    "for example , the correlation of the degrees of neighboring nodes has been identified in many real - world networks  @xcite including the yeast gene regulatory network  @xcite and there are studies on the effects of the degree - degree correlation on the structure and dynamics of complex networks  @xcite . while it has been shown  @xcite that",
    "a negative ( positive ) degree - degree correlation is irrelevant ( relevant ) to the percolation transition in complex networks , it still remains to be addressed how the correlation affects the critical phenomena of boolean networks .",
