    "space - time adaptive processing ( stap ) is an efficient tool for detection of slow targets by airborne or spaceborne radar systems in serious environments , such as strong clutter and lots of jammers @xcite .",
    "however , the full - rank adaptive stap based on linearly constrained minimum variance ( lcmv ) criterion gives rise to two of the major limitations in practical applications of radar @xcite .",
    "first , the computational load required to solve the interference matrix inversion is quite intense .",
    "in addition , the number of training data samples required for an accurate estimate of the interference covariance matrix can become impractical for high - dimensional problems , particularly in heterogeneous environments .",
    "it is therefore desirable to develop stap techniques with low computational complexity and that can provide high performance in small - sample support situations .    the diagonal loading sample matrix inversion ( lsmi ) technique is considered to be a simple and robust approach for both homogeneous and heterogeneous environments @xcite , but has a high computational cost .",
    "reduced - rank techniques have been investigated for solving the previously discussed problems in the last decades @xcite .",
    "one of the most important reduced - rank techniques is the class of the krylov subspace methods , which includes the auxiliary - vector filters ( avf ) @xcite , the multistage wiener filter ( mwf ) @xcite and the conjugate gradient ( cg ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "these methods project the observation data onto a lower - dimensional krylov subspace and can obtain an improved convergence and tracking performance .",
    "the main differences amongst them lie on the computational cost , structure of adaptation and ease of implementation .",
    "knowledge - aided ( ka ) stap techniques have currently gained significant attention as an effective stap algorithm to mitigate the effects of the heterogeneity in the secondary data by exploiting a priori knowledge @xcite .",
    "however , the exact form of prior knowledge is still problem - dependent and hard to be derived .",
    "more recently , several authors have considered sparse recovery ( sr ) ideas for moving target indication ( mti ) and stap problems @xcite . these work based on sr techniques relys on the recovery of the clutter power in the angle - doppler plane , which is usually carried out via two steps : first , recovering the clutter angle - doppler profile by some sr algorithms ; second , estimating the covariance matrix based on the result obtained in the first step , and computing the capon s optimal filter . although some fast sparse recovery algorithms are proposed , e.g. , the fast iterated shrinkage / thresholding ( fista ) algorithm @xcite , and the focal underdetermined system solution ( focuss ) based algorithm @xcite , it is more computationally expensive than conventional stap because of the capon s optimal filter requiring matrix inversion , and the recovery procedure being an additive computational burden .    in airborne radar systems ,",
    "most interference suppression problems are rank deficient in nature @xcite , that is they require less adaptive degrees of freedom ( dof ) than the full dof provided by the array . in this case",
    ", the total adaptive dof provided by the array will be much great than the number that needed to suppress the interference .",
    "motivated by this , the authors in @xcite proposed an sequential approach that gave a sparse solution for the transformation matrix to select the `` best '' dof to be retained in a partially adaptive beamformer .",
    "moreover , the property described above can be seen that there is a high degree of sparsity of the filter weight vector .",
    "hence , in our prior work , an @xmath0 type regularization to the generalized sidelobe canceler ( gsc ) stap processor using the @xmath0-based online coordinate gradient ( ocd ) method @xcite and the @xmath0-based recursive least squares method @xcite is introduced to exploit the sparsity of the received data and filter weights , resulting in an improvement in both convergence rate and steady - state signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) performance . in this paper",
    ", we extend the work presented in @xcite and @xcite to the direct filter stap processor ( dfp ) . by adding the sparsity constraint ( @xmath0-norm regularization ) to the mv cost function",
    ", we derive the @xmath0-regularized optimal filter weight vector under some reasonable assumptions , and then propose a sparsity - aware ( sa ) adaptive stap strategy for airborne radar systems . one direct way is to use the @xmath0-based smi recursion algorithm to compute the filter weights .",
    "however , it requires the matrix inversion operation , which prevents its use in practice .",
    "the cg method has a low computational complexity and is the simplest krylov subspace method since it only needs the forward stage , unlike the mwf that requires both forward and backward stages .",
    "therefore , low complexity @xmath0-based cg type algorithms are devised .",
    "the simulations are conducted using both simulated and measured data , which show that the proposed algorithms exhibit improved performance as compared to existing techniques .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii introduces the stap signal model for airborne radar . in section iii",
    ", we first introduce the strategy of the sa - stap algorithm . then @xmath0-based smi and @xmath0-based cg type algorithms are developed and their computational complexity",
    "is also shown .",
    "furthermore , we conduct an analysis of the proposed algorithms . in section iv , some examples of performance of the proposed algorithms with both simulated and the mountain top data are exhibited .",
    "finally , the conclusions are given in section v.    notation : in this paper , scalar quantities are denoted with italic typeface .",
    "lowercase boldface quantities denote vectors and uppercase boldface quantities denote matrices .",
    "the operations of transposition , complex conjugation , and conjugate transposition are denoted by superscripts @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , respectively . the symbols @xmath4 represents the kronecker product and @xmath5 denotes the hadamard matrix product . finally , the symbol @xmath6 denotes the expected value of a random quantity , operator @xmath7 $ ] selects the real part of argument , and the symbol @xmath8 denotes the @xmath9-norm operation of a vector .",
    "the system under consideration is a pulsed doppler radar residing on an airborne platform .",
    "the radar antenna is a uniformly linear spaced array ( ula ) which consists of @xmath10 elements .",

    "the chosen coordinate system is shown in fig.[fig1.sub1 ] .",
    "the angle variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 refer to elevation and azimuth .",
    "the radar transmits a coherent burst of pulses at a constant pulse repetition frequency ( prf ) @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the pulse repetition interval ( pri ) .",
    "the transmitter carrier frequency is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the propagation velocity and @xmath19 is the wavelength .",
    "the coherent processing interval ( cpi ) length is equal to @xmath20 . for each pri ,",
    "@xmath21 time samples are collected to cover the range interval . after matched filtering to the radar returns from each pulse , the received data set for one cpi comprises @xmath22 complex baseband samples , which is referred to as the radar datacube shown in fig.[fig1.sub2 ] .",
    "the data are then processed at one range of interest , which corresponds to a slice of the cpi datacube .",
    "the slice is an @xmath23 matrix which consists of @xmath24 spatial snapshots for pulses at the range of interest .",
    "it is convenient to stack the matrix column - wise to form the @xmath25 vector @xmath26 $ ] , termed a space - time snapshot , where @xmath27 is the range sample index and @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "target detection in airborne radar systems can be formulated into a binary hypothesis problem , where the hypothesis @xmath29 corresponds to target absence and the hypothesis @xmath30 corresponds to target presence , given as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a complex gain and the vector @xmath33 , which is the @xmath25 normalized space - time steering vector in the space - time look - direction , defined as @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the @xmath36 temporal steering vector at the target doppler frequency @xmath37 and @xmath38 denotes the @xmath24 spatial steering vector in the direction provided by the target frequency @xmath39 .",
    "the vector @xmath40 encompasses any undesired interference or noise component of the data including clutter @xmath41 , jamming @xmath42 and thermal noise @xmath43 .",

    "@xmath49 describes the average voltage for the @xmath50th clutter patch and @xmath27th range .",
    "the clutter - jammer - noise ( for short , calling interference in the following part ) covariance matrix @xmath51 can be expressed as @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , denote clutter , jammer and thermal noise covariance matrix , respectively .",
    "generally , the space - time processor linearly combines the elements of the data snapshot , yielding the scalar output@xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the @xmath58 weight vector .",
    "the idea behind lcmv approach is to minimize the stap output power whilst constraining the gain in the direction of the desired signal .",
    "this leads to the following power minimization with constraints @xmath59 using the method of lagrange multipliers , the optimal full - rank lcmv stap weights are given by@xcite @xmath60",
    "in this section , we detail the design of the proposed sa - stap strategy , derive the @xmath0-based smi recursion algorithm and the @xmath0-based cg type algorithms and detail their complexity . finally , the analysis of the proposed sa - stap algorithms is shown .      in airborne radar systems , most interference suppression problems are rank deficient in nature , that is they require less adaptive dof than are offered by the array",
    ", the additional dof that are not required can be discarded so that only those that are important are retained , which is termed as partially stap technique @xcite .",
    "furthermore , full dof will lead to slow convergence , i.e. requiring many snapshots to training the filter , which is difficult to obtain especially in non - homogeneous clutter environments . as a result ,",
    "the total adaptive dof provided by the array will be much great than the number that needed to suppress the interference . in another word",
    ", there is a high degree of sparsity of the filter weight vector .",
    "however , in the practical , it is not easy to estimate the required dof , related with the sparsity , and to decide which dof are the most important ones . herein , the authors in @xcite proposed an @xmath0 regularized stap algorithm for gsc structure to exploit the sparsity of the received data and filter weights . in this paper",
    ", we extend this work to a more general framework for airborne radar systems , by employing the sparse regularization to the mv stap cost function , which is described as the following optimization problem @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a positive scalar which provides a trade - off between the sparsity and the output interference power .",
    "the larger the chosen @xmath63 , the more components are shrunk to zero @xcite .",
    "the sparse regularization is usually conducted by the @xmath64-norm constraint @xcite . however , since this kind of optimization problem is known to be np - hard , one of the approximation algorithms , called @xmath0-norm , is considered for the convexity and simple complexity @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we adopt the @xmath0-norm regularization , i.e. , @xmath65 .",
    "now , the question that arises is how to effectively solve the @xmath0 regularized mv stap .",
    "albeit convex , the cost function @xmath66 is non - differentiable which leads to difficulty with the use of the method of lagrange multipliers directly .",
    "thus , we propose an approximation to the regularization term , which is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a small positive constant ( e.g. , @xmath70 is acceptable),and @xmath71 are the entries of the filter weight vector @xmath57 .",
    "thus the regularization term @xmath72 has a quadratic structure , if we assume the diagonal matrix @xmath73 to be fixed .",
    "minimization can be done iteratively by assuming that the term @xmath73 is fixed , being computed with the current solution @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "so , fixing the term @xmath73 , we take the differential term with respect to @xmath75 of ( [ eql1.3 ] ) , which is given as follows @xmath76    the above constrained optimization problem described by ( [ eql1.1 ] ) can be transformed into an unconstrained optimization problem by the method of lagrange multipliers , whose cost function becomes @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a complex lagrange multiplier .",
    "computing the gradient terms of ( [ eql1.6 ] ) with respect to @xmath75 and @xmath79 , we get @xmath80 by equating the above gradient terms to zero , we obtain the filter weight vector @xmath81^{-1}{\\bf s}}{{\\bf s}^h\\left[{\\bf r}+\\lambda{\\boldsymbol \\lambda}\\right]^{-1}{\\bf s}}.\\ ] ]    by inspecting ( [ eql1.8 ] ) , we verify that there is an additional term @xmath82 in the inverse of the interference covariance matrix @xmath51 , which is due to the @xmath0-norm regularization .",
    "one should note that the filter weight vector expression in ( [ eql1.8 ] ) is not a closed - form solution since @xmath83 is a function of @xmath57 .",
    "thus it is necessary to develop an iterative procedure to compute the filter weight vector , which will be shown in the following parts .      in practice , because the interference covariance is unknown to us , it is most common to compute the interference covariance matrix estimate as @xcite @xmath84{\\bf x}^h[n],\\ ] ] where @xmath85\\right\\}^l_{n=1}$ ] are known as the secondary or training data . in our following derivation , to develop an iterative procedure , we add an exponential weighting factor to the interference covariance matrix , which may allow the stap algorithms to accommodate possible non - stationarities in the input .",
    "we write the @xmath86 $ ] as @xmath87 = \\sum^i_{n=1}\\beta^{k - n}{\\bf x}[n]{\\bf x}^h[n]= \\beta\\hat{{\\bf r}}[k-1 ] + { \\bf x}[i]{\\bf x}^h[i],\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the forgetting factor , and @xmath89=\\delta{\\bf i}$ ] , where @xmath90 is a small positive quantity and @xmath91 is the identity matrix . since @xmath92 $ ] is a function of @xmath93 $ ] , we assume that the filter weight values do not change significantly in a single snapshot step , which is reasonable because we want the instantaneous error of the filter weight vector to change slowly @xcite .",

    ", we introduce low complexity adaptive algorithms based on cg techniques to iteratively compute the filter weights .",
    "there are two different basic strategies for using the cg method .",
    "one is the conventional cg ( ccg ) @xcite , which executes several iterations per sample and runs the reset periodically for convergence .",
    "the other is the modified cg ( mcg ) @xcite , which operates only one iteration per sample .",
    "ccg has a faster convergence than mcg , but a higher computational complexity . in the following ,",

    "for the @xmath27th sample , it assumes constant @xmath86 + \\lambda{\\boldsymbol \\lambda}[k]$ ] within the internal iterations , and @xmath104 internal iterations are performed per input data sample .",
    "the main difference between the @xmath0-based ccg algorithm and the existing ccg algorithm after the derivation is that we add an additional term @xmath105 $ ] to the estimated interference covariance matrix @xmath86 $ ] .",
    "a summary of the algorithm is shown in table [ tabel.ccg ] .",
    "the @xmath0-based ccg algorithm operates multiple iterations per sample and runs the reset periodically for convergence , which increases the computational load in the sample - by - sample update . in the following ,",
    "we detail the derivations of the @xmath0-based mcg algorithm with one iteration per sample for stap . from @xcite ,",
    "one way to realize the conjugate gradient method with one iteration per snapshot is the application of the degenerated scheme , which means that the residual vector @xmath106 $ ] will not be completely orthogonal to the subspace spanned by the direction vectors @xmath107,{\\bf p}[1],\\cdots,{\\bf p}[k-1]\\right\\}$ ] . under this condition",

    ", we note that the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithms is related to the cg - based weight vector error @xmath132 $ ] and the condition number @xmath133 .      in this section ,",
    "we detail the computational complexity in terms of complex additions and complex multiplications of the proposed @xmath0-based smi , @xmath0-based cg type algorithms , and other existing stap algorithms , namely the lsmi , the avf , the mwf and the conventional cg type algorithms , as shown in table [ table.complexity ] .",
    "one aspect should be noted that , the rank @xmath104 may not equal to the clutter rank , and can be smaller than that .",
    "this is because the principle of the krylov subspace approach is different from that of the eigen - decomposition approach .",
    "an eigen - decomposition approach would usually require an svd on the full - rank covariance matrix and the selection of the @xmath104 eigenvectors associated with the @xmath104 largest eigenvalues , which is high related to the clutter rank .",
    "in contrast to that , the krylov - based approach does not require eigen - decomposition and selects the @xmath104 basis vectors which minimize the desired cost function and will form the projection matrix , where @xmath104 can be decreased without significantly degrading the sinr @xcite . in the table , @xmath104 is the rank for ccg type , avf and mwf algorithms , and @xmath134 is the system size .",
    "seen from the table , the computational complexity of @xmath0-based smi is similar to the conventional lsmi algorithm , both requiring one to calculate the matrix inversion . with respect to the proposed @xmath0-based cg type algorithms ,",
    "the computational complexity is nearly the same as the conventional cg type algorithms .",
    "note that the complexity of ccg type , avf and mwf algorithms is dependent on the rank @xmath104 .",
    "this is a tradeoff between complexity and performance .",
    "we found that the rank of the proposed @xmath0-based ccg algorithm with @xmath135 works well ( while the best rank for avf and mwf is much larger ) , as will be verified in the following simulations .",
    "the low - rank characteristic will bring computational savings .",
    "the computational complexity of all algorithms is shown in fig.[complexity ] , where we use the best rank obtained from the simulations for these algorithms ( @xmath135 for ccg type , @xmath136 for avf and @xmath137 for mwf ) .",
    "we see that the proposed cg type algorithms have much lower complexity than avf and mwf algorithms .",
    "furthermore , it requires to compute the filter weights repeatedly for target detection in airborne radar systems , especially in heterogeneous environment . in this case",
    ", our proposed algorithms can work in an iterative way and do not need to recompute all the filter weights , which can lead to significant computational savings .",
    "usually , secondary data of the sliding window are used in detection procedures , where the parameter that defines the length of the sliding window is @xmath21 .",
    "assume @xmath138 $ ] denotes the estimated interference covariance matrix according to ( [ smi.2 ] ) and @xmath139 $ ] denotes the filter weight vector at the cell under test ( cut ) of the @xmath126th range bin , respectively .",
    "consider the case of the @xmath140th cut , we first remove the impact of @xmath140th cut , given by @xmath141 = { \\bf r}_i[k]-{\\bf x}[i+1]{\\bf x}^h[i+1].\\ ] ] since an exponentially decaying data window is used , we do not need to remove the first snapshot used to compute the filter weights .",
    "then , similarly , we consider the case of adding snapshots .",
    "two snapshots , one is at the primary @xmath126th cut and another is the new snapshot @xmath142 which was not included in the sliding window before , should be added to the @xmath140th cut secondary data .",

    "in addition , the proposed algorithms adopt an adaptive filtering approaches , which can obtain a near optimum interference rejection at a low cost @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that filtering can be accomplished in a pipeline mode as the echo pulses come in .",
    "the required number of calculations for filtering can be realized easily with nowadays digital technology @xcite .      at this point",
    ", we have finished the derivation of the sa - stap algorithms .",
    "the following simulation results will show that the proposed sa - stap algorithms have a faster sinr convergence speed and better sinr steady - state performance than the conventional algorithms .",
    "this translates into a superior detection performance .",
    "however , why do the sa - stap algorithms work is an interesting question . this section will try to explain that from two points of view .",
    "first , to understand the behavior , we write the filter weight vector using the eigenvalue decomposition ( evd ) of @xmath146 .",
    "we assume that the eigenvalues of the estimated interference covariance matrix are @xmath147 with the corresponding eigenvectors denoted by @xmath148 , @xmath149 .",
    "the eigenvalues are ordered as , @xmath150 thus , through the evd , the estimated interference covariance matrix can be written as @xmath151 substituting ( [ a.r ] ) into ( [ eql1.8 ] ) , the filter weight vector of the sa - stap algorithm can be written as @xmath152 where @xmath153 , @xmath154 is the difference between @xmath155 and @xmath156 , and @xmath157 is a scalar quantity , which does not affect the sinr .    by inspecting ( [ a.4 ] ) , we observe that the sa - stap belongs to the class of diagonal loading stap techniques in a sense .",
    "moreover , it is equivalent to an adaptive diagonal loading technique , which will apply to each eigenbeam of the interference covariance matrix different weights and exploit the sparsity of the filter weights and the received data .",
    "second , we will investigate the relationship between the sinr performance and the @xmath0-norm - sum quantity of the filter weights .",
