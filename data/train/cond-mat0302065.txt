    ", the spin glass ( sg ) transition for strongly disordered regime has been confirmed in the gauge glass systems by numerical simulations @xcite and renormalization group ( rg ) analyses @xcite , which is consistent with experimental observations @xcite .    in two dimensions ,",

    "although the long - range sg order is denied in two dimensions @xcite , there is a possibility of a quasi - long - range order in which the sg correlation decays according to a power law @xcite like the ferromagnetic ( fm ) correlation in the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) phase @xcite .",
    "some numerical simulations supported the latter case @xcite , while experimental observation @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite deny it . in weakly disordered regime ,",
    "the instability of the kt phase against small disorder is suggested by the perturbation expansion and the rg analysis @xcite , while it is denied by numerical simulations @xcite and other rg analyses @xcite .",
    "there is another controversy in two dimensions about the existence of re - entrant transition from the kt phase to the non - kt one .",

    "the same results are obtained by monte carlo simulations @xcite and the rg analyses @xcite .",
    "since randomness and frustration make it difficult to examine short - range systems analytically as well as numerically , only few things have been confirmed definitely in spite of huge number of studies .",
    "thus , it is highly desirable to have analytic method for understanding the thermodynamic and critical behaviors in random spin systems .",
    "the method of gauge transformation is a useful technique to derive analytic results in gauge symmetric random spin systems @xcite .",
    "it was firstly applied to the ising sg models @xcite , and provides the internal energy and an upper bound on the specific heat exactly as non - singular functions of the temperature on the nishimori line in the temperature - randomness phase diagram .",
    "further , it is proven that the boundary between the fm and non - fm phases in the temperature lower than the multicritical point ( mcp , see fig .  [ phased ] ) at which paramagnetic ( pm ) , fm and sg phases meet and the nishimori line intersects , is vertical or re - entrant . using a model with a modified probability distribution of randomness ,",
    "the verticality is concluded @xcite , which implies the absence of re - entrance : although the theory needs a plausible but unproved assumption on the thermodynamic behavior of the modified model , the result is consistent with other theories and experiments of ising - like spin glasses @xcite .",

    "the gauge transformation is also extended to dynamical systems @xcite . for the ising sg case ,",
    "some important relations are derived for nonequilibrium auto - correlation functions , order parameter and energy relaxations .",
    "they provide discussions on the absence of re - entrance , the regime of the mixed phase in the phase diagram , the multi - critical dynamics , and the equivalence of two nonequilibrium processes in the sg phase .",

    "in contrast to the standard sg systems , not many studies on the dynamical properties have been performed for gauge glass systems .",
    "it would be helpful for future investigations to present exact results including dynamical properties .    in this paper , we study the gauge transformation for dynamical systems of the gauge glass model . in the static case",
    ", the gauge symmetric models can be treated in the same manner as the ising sg @xcite .",
    "it is also straightforward to apply the dynamical gauge theory for the ising sg @xcite , in which the stochastic dynamics is treated , to the gauge glass model .",
    "since the gauge glass system has a continuous spin space , one can consider a deterministic dynamics with equations of motion , which is also treated in the present theory .",
    "several exact relations are derived among dynamical quantities such as equilibrium and nonequilibrium auto - correlation functions , relaxation functions of order parameter and internal energy .",
    "using them , we discuss physical properties including the aging , the multicritical dynamics , dynamics in the sg , a possible mixed phase and griffiths phase , and the absence of re - entrant transition in two or higher dimensions .",

    "<S> several exact relations are derived among dynamical quantities such as equilibrium and nonequilibrium auto - correlation functions , relaxation functions of order parameter and internal energy . </S>",
    "<S> they provide physical properties in terms of dynamics in the sg phase , a possible mixed phase and the griffiths phase , the multicritical dynamics and the aging phenomenon . </S>",
