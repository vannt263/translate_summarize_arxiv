    "one of the most challenging aspects of heavy @xmath0 resonance searches lies in the reconstruction and identification of boosted top quark decays .",
    "a top quark being produced with very high transverse momentum is a source of a new experimental phenomenology : its decay products become very collimated ( figure  [ topo_jetmass].a ) and as a consequence , jets tend to merge into a single reconstructed jet .",
    "different boost regimes will give rise to different event topologies .",
    "as shown in figure  [ topo_jetmass].b the mass of the heaviest jet ( the jet mass is defined as the mass of the 4-momenta sum of its massless constituents ) in the event can be used to classify such topologies .",
    "the main motivation that drives the so - called minimal approach is its applicability in the very early stages of the experiment with a high signal efficiency over a wide range of @xmath1 .",
    "it relies on a few number of observables , no flavour tagging ( for @xmath2-jets ) is employed and it does not attempt to reconstruct the top quarks individually . as a consequence , the algorithm can be commissioned early on in the experiment and the sensitivity to systematic biases is minimised .",
    "jets are defined by means of the atlas cone algorithm with a @xmath3 parameter of 0.4 and only those jets with transverse energy @xmath4 greater than 40 gev are further considered in the analysis .",
    "the events are classified according to the highest jet mass and the number of jets in the event . thus with 4 or more selected jets , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 refers to the 4 highest @xmath4 jets , the reconstructed letpon and the reconstructed neutrino ( from the @xmath9 mass constraint using the missing @xmath10 and the lepton momentum ) , respectively . with 3 selected jets , similarly , @xmath11 but",
    "the sample is further split into two subsamples of events according to the highest jet mass found in the event ( that is if @xmath12 is above or below 65 gev ) . in the absence of signal , an exclusion limit of @xmath13 br(@xmath14 ) = 3.6 pb ( 1.1 pb ) is expected with this method for a resonance mass of 1 tev ( 2 tev ) ( see figure  [ sensitivities].a ) .",
    "this algorithm aims at providing a much tighter control of the reducible background by performing , as its name suggests , a full reconstruction of the top and anti - top quark .",
    "flavour tagging is also used .",
    "jets are defined by means of the anti-@xmath15 algorithm with a @xmath3 parameter of 0.4 and only those jets with transverse energy @xmath4 greater than 20 gev are further considered in the analysis .",
    "this full reconstruction approach also adapts its reconstruction scheme according to the event topology which is determined by classifying events according to the highest jet mass in the event .",
    "the measured top masses are in addition replaced by the generated top mass @xmath16 in order to improve the resonance mass resolution . in the absence of signal , an exclusion limit of @xmath13 br(@xmath14 ) = 2.9",
    "pb ( 1.1 pb ) is expected with this method for a resonance mass of 1 tev ( 2 tev ) ( see figure  [ sensitivities].b ) .",
    "* @xmath17 gev ( resolved ) : + @xmath18 jets required , among which 2 should be identified @xmath2-jets . @xmath19 * 65 gev @xmath20 gev ( partial merge ) : + @xmath21 jets required , among which 1 should be identified @xmath2-jets . @xmath22 * @xmath23 gev ( mono - jet ) : + @xmath24 jets required , among which 1 should be identified @xmath2-jets .",
    "@xmath25      the mono - jet reconstruction algorithm favors the high end of the @xmath1 spectrum where top quarks are highly boosted .",
    "it offers a good mass resolution and a strong handle on the background processes . as opposed to the previous two reconstruction approaches , this algorithm solely relies on the mono - jet topology which is enhanced by the choice of the jet definition .",
    "indeed , the anti-@xmath15 algorithm with a @xmath3 parameter of 1.0 is employed .",
    "three - dimensional topological calorimeter clusters are used as inputs and only those jets with transverse energy @xmath4 greater than 200 gev are further considered in the analysis to reflect the assumption that the top quarks are boosted .",
    "only at least two jets are required and @xmath26 , wjere @xmath27 is the identified top mono - jet and @xmath28 is the reconstructed semi - leptonic top . in the absence of signal , an exclusion limit of @xmath13 br(@xmath14 ) = 3.3",
    "pb ( 1.1 pb ) is expected with this method for a resonance mass of 1 tev ( 2 tev ) ( see figure  [ sensitivities].c ) .",
    "the boosted top identification is detailed in the following sub - sections .",
    "+    the high transverse momentum of the leptonically decaying top quark causes the lepton from the @xmath9 decay to be embedded in the jet . as a result ,",
    "the traditional lepton isolation requirements become inefficient .",
    "one therefore needs to disentangle this signal from soft leptons in jets originating from the decay of @xmath29- and @xmath30-hadrons in heavy flavor qcd jets .",
    "this can be achieved by using discriminant observables to probe the presence of a hard lepton in the jet .",
    "figure  [ substructure].c , d shows distribution of such observables for boosted semi - leptonic top candidates . + for hadronically decaying top quarks in the mono - jet topology , the decay products are fully merged and reconstructed as a single fat jet . the challenge here is to disentangle top mono - jets from qcd high-@xmath31 jets .",
    "the jet mass ( figure  [ substructure].a ) is a natural observable to do so but it does not probe the jet hard substructure that we expect from a 3 body decay . to achieve this ,",
    "the hierarchical nature of the @xmath32 jet algorithm is exploited by reclustering the initial jet s constituents with the @xmath32 algorithm .",
    "the last and penultimate stages of this process correspond on average to the merging of the top quark decay products and hence jet substructure can be probed via the first few @xmath32 splitting scales ( figure  [ substructure].b ) .",
    "three complementary algorithms for the reconstruction of the @xmath0 invariant mass spectrum have been developed and their performance evaluated on fully simulated events .",
    "two adaptations of classical top reconstruction algorithms allow for high signal efficiency even in the tev regime ( @xmath33% and 5% in the @xmath34 tev range for the minimal and full reconstruction approaches respectively ) .",
    "the mono - jet approach has been shown to be efficient down to @xmath35 tev , with a signal efficiency of @xmath36% ( 15% ) at @xmath37 tev ( 2 tev ) .",
    "thus , the very challenging mass region where different topologies coexist is covered .",
    "if no deviation from the standard model is observed , a 95% c.l .",
    "limit of @xmath13 br(@xmath14 ) = 3 pb is expected for a resonance mass of 1 tev after 200 pb@xmath38 at center - of - mass energy of 10 tev .",
    "approximately the same sensitivity for @xmath37 tev is expected for 1 fb@xmath38 of data at 7 tev ."
