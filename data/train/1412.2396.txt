    "tracing the evolution of information falling into a black hole has recently become the focus of increased research activity .",
    "the premise naturally tests the limits of quantum information theory and string theory , and necessitates a peek into black hole horizon mechanics .",

    "complex physical systems scramble information over times scaling as a power law in the entropy .",
    "this phenomenon is generic , dictated by ergodic , random walk - like dissipation of information .",
    "motivated by various paradoxes and thought experiments , the authors of  @xcite have proposed that a black hole is the fastest scrambling machine , diffusing information on timescales given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is entropy and @xmath2 is temperature . indeed , any faster scrambling would lead to a violation of the no - cloning principle of quantum mechanics . to date , there is no known physical system proven to achieve such a fast rate of scrambling .",
    "contrived non - physical models have been developed in the literature  @xcite , but none that are related to black holes or gravitational dynamics , let alone being realized within string theory ( other interesting efforts in this direction can be found in  @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "if the conjecture of  @xcite is correct , string theory  or any candidate theory of quantum gravity  should be able to demonstrate this fast scrambling phenomenon . in  @xcite",
    ", it was suggested that matrix theory , as a framework for m theory , may provide for a fast scrambling mechanism .    in a previous work  @xcite , a controlled setting for addressing the fast scrambling conjecture was developed within berenstein - maldacena - nastase ( bmn ) matrix theory  @xcite .",
    "the latter is related to the banks - fischler - shenker - susskind ( bfss ) matrix model  @xcite and is also conjectured to describe dynamics of m - theory  in particular light - cone m - theory in a plane - wave background .",
    "the bmn setup comes with a infra - red cutoff ( related to the background plane wave ) which allows for vacua in the form of bogomolnyi-prasad-sommerfield ( bps ) spherical membranes ( m2 branes of light - cone m - theory ) , or fuzzy spheres ( d2 branes of iia theory )  @xcite . in the proper regime of the parameters ,",
    "gravitational geometries have been identified that are dual to these matrix vacua  @xcite . on the matrix theory side",
    ", one can perturb around these vacua and effectively study the dynamics of these objects .",
    "qubits correspond to the spherical harmonic modes of the eleven dimensional supergravity multiplet on a sphere .",
    "the system has both an infrared ( ir ) cutoff ( the size of the sphere ) and an ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff ( related to @xmath3 , the regularization of the fuzzy sphere ) .",
    "the remaning @xmath4 bosonic degrees of freedom describe the deformations of the shape of the m2 sphere in a three dimensional subset of the full space .",
    "( b ) our setup makes a heat bath out of the membrane ripples , in the background of which the qubits evolve . integrating out the bosonic heat bath generates a dense network of interactions between the qubits .",
    "we look for entanglement evolution in this qubit system to determine whether bmn matrix theory has the right ingredients to be a fast scrambler.,width=528 ]    these perturbations of the fuzzy spheres come in two types : geometric deformations of the spherical membrane , appearing as bosonic degrees of freedom in the matrix theory ; and harmonics of the eleven dimensional supergravity multiplet  arising from fermionic degrees of freedom in the matrix theory . in  @xcite",
    ", it was shown that , for the vacuum of bmn theory corresponding to a single spherical m2 brane with @xmath3 units of light - cone momentum , the perturbation dynamics can be mapped onto the dynamics of @xmath5 qubits coupled to @xmath4 bosonic variables that describe the shape of the m2 brane ( see figure  [ fig : cartoon ] ) .",
    "it was then demonstrated that the coupling between the qubits and the bosonic variables is necessary if the bmn theory is to achieve fast scrambling in the qubit sector .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on an explicit computation in bmn matrix theory with aim to ascertain whether the theory is indeed a fast scrambler .",
    "we start with the system of  @xcite and arrange the bosonic degrees of freedom in a heat bath at a fixed temperature @xmath2 .",
    "this represents for us a background matrix black hole model  @xcite through which we can trace the evolution of the qubits .",
    "we then compute the density matrix of the qubit system and measure entanglement as a function of time at one loop order .",
    "since the qubits represent the graviton , 3-form , and gravitino modes of eleven dimensional supergravity , we are then tracking the evolution of information stored in the supergravity multiplet near the surface of a spherical rippling m2 brane .",
    "we are able to obtain a closed form expression for the entanglement entropy .",
    "we then extract the timescale of information scrambling from this result .",
    "our results are consistent with a scrambling time that scales as the logarithm of the entropy of the qubits .    in section 2",
    ", we develop the perturbation theory about the bps membrane vacua of bmn theory . in section 3 ,",
    "we present the core technology , the feynman - vernon technique of integrating out a heat bath ; and we apply it to our system leading up to identifying the fast scrambling timescale . in section 4 , we present our conclusions and a discussion of future directions .",
    "the appendices collect some of the more detailed results : appendix a shows samples of combinatorial terms arising from the feynman diagrams used in the computation ; appendix b shows a justification of the chosen coupling constant for a perturbative expansion ; and appendix c shows the main result  part of the computed entanglement entropy as a function time  used in identifying fast scrambling .",

    "@xmath72 and @xmath73 are linear in the structure constants @xmath74 , while @xmath75 is quadratic . in appendix b , we demonstrate that these @xmath74s are @xmath3 independent for large @xmath3 .",

    "the reason we are interested in the regime delineated by  ( [ eq : regime ] ) is that strongly coupled non - commutative dynamics of a spherical d2 brane is rather reminiscent of the matrix black hole proposals of  @xcite .",
    "hence , through perturbation in @xmath70 we may expect to capture the essence of black hole horizon physics  keeping in non - local dynamics in the picture yet scaling out superfluous complications from gravity , as is typical in non - commutative field theory settings  @xcite .",

    "the remaining terms of the lagrangian , @xmath72 and @xmath75 , involve cubic and quartic interactions between these modes  scaled respectively by @xmath70 and @xmath97 . in the limit of small @xmath70 we will be focusing on",
    ", we will see that we do not need to consider these interactions for the purpose of demonstrating fast scrambling .",
    "hence we do not show the explicit and rather complicated forms of @xmath72 and @xmath75 .",
    "the fermionic sector involves diagonalized quadratic terms  @xcite @xmath98 where the dot implies sum over the @xmath99 indices of the spinors .",
    "quantizing this diagonalized form leads to the hamiltonian @xmath100 with the commutation relations @xmath101 hence , we have a system of @xmath5 disjoint qubits ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "however , there is also coupling to the bosonic sector through the terms @xmath102 where we have used the compact notation introduced in the previous section ; and the @xmath103s are defined by @xmath104 the coefficients shown as @xmath105 , with @xmath106 , are rather complicated numerical expressions .",
    "samples are shown in appendix a. they satisfy the identities @xmath107 which assure that the lagrangian is real .",
    "they consist of linear combinations of the structure constants @xmath74 of equation  ( [ eq : fs ] ) , and hence involve the combinatorics of combining angular momentum modes through @xmath108 and @xmath109 symbols .",

    "each line has @xmath114 polarizations labeled by the angular momenta indices @xmath42 and @xmath49 .",

    "( b ) integrating out the bosonic heat bath leaves a fermi four - qubit interaction that creates a large number of interaction links between the @xmath5 qubits of the system .",
    "the scrambling mechanism arises entirely from diagrams i , ii , and iii , all involving one or more @xmath73 couplings .",

    "i.e. _ an angular momentum mode couples to almost all other angular momentum modes .",
    "interestingly , the strongest couplings arise between the largest and smallest angular momentum modes.,width=624 ]    our approach is to compute the density matrix for the qubits as a function of time  using the bosonic sector as a heat bath at a fixed temperature .",
    "we then construct the reduced density matrix by integrating over half of the qubits and obtain the entanglement entropy as a function of time . analyzing this , we extract the characteristic scrambling timescale as a function of @xmath3 . to manage the computation , we consider the limit of small coupling constant @xmath111 and large @xmath118 . in this small @xmath70 regime ,",
    "our leading order computation amounts to considering the schematic feynman diagrams shown in figure  [ fig : diagrams ] .",
    "we would then be integrating out the bosonic dynamics to order @xmath97 leading to a four qubit fermi interaction .",
    "these quartic interactions are bound to generate a dense network of connections between the qubits , and the question we are to address is whether this high density of connections is enough to lead to _ fast _ scrambling of qubit information . in this regard , note that entanglement can only be generated by a boson - fermion - fermion vertex since this is the only dynamical mechanism for flipping and entangling qubits . in particular , there is no direct scrambling at a work in the last two diagrams of figure  [ fig : diagrams](a ) .",
    "our first goal is to compute the density matrix of the qubit system in the background of a bosonic thermal bath .",
    "we do this by using the feynman - vernon path integration technique  @xcite . in this language ,",
    "the @xmath60s and @xmath62s become grassmanian variables . to simplify the notation ,",
    "we represent them as @xmath119 @xmath120 with @xmath121 being the @xmath99 index .",

    "the novelty that arises in the feynman - vernon technique  as opposed to the traditional path integration approach to scattering amplitude computations  is that the in - out qubits ( row - column entry labels ) of the density matrix specify the boundary conditions in the path integration .",
    "in addition , we need to adapt the original feynman - vernon technique to a system involving fermions . as depicted in figure 1(a ) , the computation is expected to be at the one - loop level to order @xmath97 .",

    "this leaves the @xmath137 terms arising in diagram iii only , while the remaining two diagrams , i and ii , involve the @xmath138 terms . due to the complexity of the computation ,",
    "we will attempt to simplify things further : we drop diagram iii with the following reasoning : considering this diagram in addition to diagram ii can only _ add _ interactions between the qubits that may lead to faster but not slower scrambling ; and if we can show that diagram ii is enough to achieve fast scrambling without considering diagram iii , our goal is achieved . on the other hand , if we were to find that the system does _ not _ fast scramble",
    ", we would need to come back and add diagram iii and check once again .",
    "phrased differently , we are trying to find an _ upper bound _ on the scrambling timescale ; and if considering either diagram ii _ or _ iii demonstrates a timescale bound scaling logarithmically with entropy , we have proved that the system is a fast scrambler .",
    "this additional simplification then allows us to drop the @xmath137 terms as well from  ( [ eq : sbf ] ) .",

    "we first trace over about half of the qubits by integrating out the @xmath181 variables to generate a reduced density matrix @xmath182 this operation takes the integral form over grassmanian variables @xmath183 this gives an expression of the form @xmath184 @xmath185 arises from diagram i of figure  [ fig : diagrams](a ) or @xmath177 in equation  ( [ eq : rho ] ) ; whereas @xmath186 arises from diagram ii or @xmath178 in equation  ( [ eq : rho ] ) . we can then obtain the von neumann entropy through @xmath187 however , there is a subtlety one needs to be careful about .",
    "our computation at one loop renormalizes the qubit wavefunctions .",
    "hence , we need to make sure that the proper counter terms are added so that @xmath188 we write @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the ` bare ' density matrix computed as a series expansion in @xmath70 @xmath191 and @xmath192 is the ( wavefunction ) renormalization factor @xmath193 and we can see that one needs @xmath194 this then leads to the following expression for the entropy in terms of the bare density matrix @xmath195 note that the leading contribution of the entanglement entropy arises at order @xmath196 and there is no contribution to this from any part of the density matrix beyond order @xmath97 .",
    "hence , to obtain the entanglement entropy at leading order in @xmath70 , we must compute @xmath197 and @xmath198  both of which we have done .",
    "however , for the purposes of identifying the scrambling timescale , we have found that looking at the @xmath199 term is enough to demonstrate fast scrambling .",
    "hence , we do not write the very lengthy full result and instead only quote the result for @xmath197 in appendix c.      in this section , we collect the results of analyzing the evolution of the von neumann entropy .",
    "we have computed the entire expression given by  ( [ eq : entropy ] ) in closed form .",

    "we are hence unable to present analytical results .",

    "however , the model on the left gives as good of a fit as the logarithmic model of figure  [ fig : nplot ] .",

    ", it can only be used to find an _",
    "upper bound _ on scrambling timescale since the additional diagram that we have ignored can only make the scrambling faster .",
    "hence , there is the possibility that our computation is identifying a power law upper bound on scrambling timescale that , over the range of @xmath3 values we explored , decreases with @xmath3 but then at some point must and would reverse and increase with @xmath3 as needed .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ] .,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]    we are then lead to conclude that the data is promising evidence that the bmn matrix model , in the regime of the parameters we have explored , is a fast scrambler as suggested by figure  [ fig : nplot ] .",
    "yet we can not conclusively rule out the possibility that we have instead identified a strange power law upper bound as depicted on the left of figure  [ fig : nplot2 ] .    .",
    "high temperature is towards the left of the horizontal axis , low temperature on the right .",
    "the inset shows a zoomed out range for low enough temperatures that are still above the ir cutoff scale . for this plot",
    ", we have @xmath208.,width=480 ]    finally , assuming the promising logarithmic trend of figure  [ fig : nplot ] , we look at the temperature dependence of the scrambling time . figure  [ fig : temp ] shows the scrambling time as a function of inverse temperature @xmath215 . as discussed earlier , the system has a ir cutoff of order one in units of @xmath16",
    "hence , at low temperatures @xmath216 , we expect finite size effects to kick in and a freeze out of the heat bath temperature .",
    "correspondingly , we see from the figure that the scrambling timescale becomes independent of temperature  that is , there is no dynamics in larger thermal wavelengths than the size of the box in which the system is placed . for low enough temperatures @xmath86 above the ir cutoff scale",
    ", we should however expect @xmath217 .",
    "the inset in the figure shows a zoomed view of this temperature regime , demonstrating a linear dependence on @xmath215 as expected .",
    "[ sub : conclusion ]    given the connections fast scrambling has to black hole dynamics  @xcite , our result is further circumstantial evidence that bmn matrix theory is a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "however , the mechanism of fast scrambling we identified is also present in the bfss lagrangian : a dense network of connections between qubits arising from the commutator of matrices , essentially from the density of the structure constants of equation  ( [ eq : fs ] ) .",
    "hence , the more general implication of this work is a confirmation of the suggestion by  @xcite that m - theory - related matrix theories are indeed fast scramblers .",
    "furthermore , to achieve this fast scrambling , the problem relies on the combinatorial complexities involved in coupling representations of @xmath29  that is , a dense web of interactions between all spherical harmonic modes  which in turn makes an asymptotic analytical treatment most challenging .",
    "it is interesting to note that the structure constants of equation  ( [ eq : fs ] ) which determine the density of the effective qubit - qubit network are peaked for couplings that mix the highest and lowest angular momentum modes  as if a stringy uv - ir mixing is central to the highly efficient scrambling dynamics .",
    "the model we employed is very reminiscent of the matrix black hole of  @xcite . in a sense , we have made this original matrix black hole narrative more concrete : a heat bath associated with the shape of a spherical membrane  a structure akin to the membrane paradigm of the black hole horizon  to which one tethers qubits that represent the supergravity degrees of freedom .",
    "the equilibrium state would correspond to the two sectors of the model  the membrane shape degrees of freedom and the qubits  being in thermal equilibrium . in this work",
    ", we artificially arranged the qubits in their ground state and tracked the subsequent evolution towards thermalization .",
    "this then naturally allowed us to identify the scrambling timescale .",
    "the energy regime we focused on corresponds to non - local fuzzy d2 brane dynamics , strongly coupled yet without gravitational dressing .",
    "the implication is that gravitational physics is a red herring in the information scrambling problem : the relevant ingredient is non - local interactions near the black hole horizon .",
    "this setup is only one step of exploration in an otherwise very rich system that admits many more interesting black hole - related applications .    for future explorations , there are many interesting venues to pursue .",
    "one can complete the full calculation by including all feynman diagrams to construct the full form of the entanglement entropy as a function of time .",
    "while we do not expect that this will add to the punchline of fast scrambling , analyzing the full form of the evolution of the entropy may help identify other interesting timescales that are typically at work in thermalization processes  @xcite . and",
    "while we were forced to fall back on a numerical analysis of the final entropy expression , there is the potential for a successful analytical analysis : the asymptotics of the structure constants for @xmath218 can be worked out using edmonds relations and their extensions  @xcite .",
    "the analogue of the thermodynamic limit in our system is indeed the regime @xmath219 ; and hence techniques used in traditional statistical systems can perhaps be used to tame the complicated entropy expression .    black hole evaporation should correspond to qubits freeing themselves from the thermal bath , the membrane at the horizon .",
    "the entanglement between hawking radiation and the black hole then translates to the entanglement between evaporated qubits and membrane - attached qubits .",
    "toy models of qubit - based evaporation mechanisms for black holes have already been explored in the literature  @xcite , albeit with too much freedom in choosing arbitrary mechanisms of qubit - qubit interactions . however",
    ", this matrix theory model provides for a concrete string theory - embedded mechanism for determining the details of matrix black hole evaporation . along the same line of thought , one can attempt to address the in - fall problem by initially arranging for a small subspace of the matrices away from the spherical configuration and then tracking the merging of the probe into the membrane structure .",
    "qubits can then once again be used as probes of the evolution of information into the matrix black hole . perhaps all this can lead to a better understanding of a horizon firewall  @xcite .",
    "bmn matrix theory also admits other interesting regimes in its parameter space .",
    "in particular , spherical five brane vacua can be realized in the theory , along with a similar perturbation problem yet to be explored .",
    "finally , vacua of bmn matrix theory have dual holographic spacetimes that are valid geometries in complementary regimes to the one we have focused on  @xcite .",
    "our setup corresponds instead to a setting without gravity but with non - local dynamics ",
    "the realm of non - commutative field theories .",
    "it would be interesting to develop a more detailed map between qubits or perturbations in the matrix theory language and corresponding supergravity excitation modes .",
    "this would help to directly connect the scrambling dynamics we analyzed to the supergravity black hole scrambling phenomenon .",
    "here we give a couple of samples for the type of expressions that arise in computing the boson - qubit coupling terms of the action , packaged into what we label as the @xmath221 coefficients .",
    "for example , we have @xmath222 or @xmath223    in writing @xmath221 , we have @xmath224 and @xmath225 . for @xmath226 and @xmath227 ,",
    "the @xmath221 is a scalar , but for other @xmath228s it is a vector in the @xmath229 index . as shown in appendix b ,",
    "the @xmath117s are @xmath3 independent .",
    "the interactions packaged in the @xmath220s are essentially a packaging of the combinatorics of combining @xmath29 representations .      in this appendix",
    ", we show that the structure constants @xmath230 are @xmath3 independent .",
    "figure  [ fig : fplots ] shows a plot of @xmath230 for all values of its indices .",
    "the horizontal axis is scaled from @xmath231 to @xmath232 to map onto the various possibilities of @xmath233  sorted according to the value of the corresponding @xmath230 .",
    "the different curves correspond to different values of @xmath3 , from @xmath207 to @xmath234 .",
    "we see a clear convergence pattern , with the maximum and minimum values of @xmath117 capped off about @xmath235 , independent of @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , the asymptotic form of this profile for large @xmath3 can be obtained in closed form through edmonds formula  @xcite .",
    "the peaks of @xmath117 arise when two of the @xmath42s are maximized and the third is minimized .",
    "for example , for @xmath236 , maxima arise around @xmath237 and permutations of these @xmath238 , @xmath239 , and @xmath240 .",
    "this implies that the predominant contribution in our computation comes from dynamics that mixes the highest and lowest angular momentum modes .     versus all allowed values of @xmath233 .",
