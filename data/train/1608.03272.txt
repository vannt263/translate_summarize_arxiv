    "the type ia supernovae and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite observations point out that our universe is precisely accelerating which is caused by some unknown fluid having positive energy density and negative pressure , called as  dark energy \" ( de ) .",

    "moreover , the reconstruction phenomenon of different de models @xcite gains great attention to discuss the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "+ in recent years , an interest has been proposed to study the dark energy in the new form i.e. , holographic dark energy ( hde ) model @xcite which arises from the holographic principle @xcite stating that the number of degrees of freedom of a physical model must be finite @xcite and an infrared cut - off should constrain it @xcite . in quantum field theory @xcite ,",

    "in this work , we have assumed the @xmath0 modified gravity theory in the background of flat frw universe .",
    "we found the modified friedmann equations and then from the equations , we found the effective energy density and pressure for @xmath0 modified gravity theory .",
    "modified gravity gives a natural unification of the early - time inflation and late - time acceleration .",
    "we have assumed two types of power law forms of scale factor , the first class ( class i ) has the future singularity and the second class ( class ii ) has the initial singularity . in the framework of @xmath0 modified gravity model , four types of dark energy",
    "have been considered , they are ( i ) entropy - corrected holographic dark energy ( echde ) in power - law version , ( ii ) entropy - corrected holographic dark energy ( echde ) in logarithmic version,(iii ) entropy - corrected new agegraphic dark energy ( ecnade ) in power - law version and ( iv ) entropy - corrected new agegraphic dark energy ( ecnade ) in logarithmic version , where , @xmath74 is assumed to be the future event horizon and @xmath20 is assumed to be conformal time . using the two classes of scale factors , the unknown function @xmath0 has been found in term of @xmath1 for echde and ecnade models in power - law and logarithmic versions . the corresponding equation of states have also been generated .",
    "for the cases of echde and ecnade in power - law and logarithmic versions the natures of @xmath0 vs @xmath1 have been shown in figures * 1 * , * 2 * , * 7 * , * 8 * , * 13 * , * 14 * , * 19 * , * 20*. for the cases of echde in power - law version ( class i ) and logarithmic version ( class i and ii ) , ecnade in power - law version ( class i ) and logarithmic version ( class i and ii ) the equation of state parameter @xmath88 has been shown in * figures 3 , 5 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 15 , 17 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 * whereas in figures * 3 * , * 5 * ; * 21 * , * 23 * and * 22 * , * 24 * the eos parameter is divergent at @xmath126,@xmath127 ; @xmath128 , @xmath129 and at @xmath130 , @xmath131 . for the cases of echde in power - law version ( class ii ) and ecnade in power - law version ( class ii ) the equation of state parameter @xmath88 has been shown in figures * 4 * , * 6 * , * 16 * , * 18 * and from the figures we have seen that these models lie entirely in the phantom region .",
    "it should be mentioned that karami et al @xcite have investigated the @xmath0 reconstructions for hde , nade models and logarithmic versions of echde , ecnade models only and for these models we got the similar expressions of @xmath0 but we have details studied the results graphically . to examine the stability test for all the reconstructing models",
    ", we have investigated the signs of the square of the velocity of sound . for echde model in power - law version , we have concluded from figures * 25 * and * 27 * , that the corresponding model is a classical stable for @xmath132 , @xmath133 and classically unstable for @xmath134 , @xmath135 for the first class and from figures * 26 * and * 28 * the corresponding model is a classically unstable for second class of a given perturbation in general relativity . for echde model in logarithmic version ,",
    "we have concluded from figures * 29 * , * 30 * , * 31 * , * 32 * that the corresponding models are unstable for class i and class ii both . on the other hand , for ecnade model in power - law version ( class i ) , we have seen from figures * 33 * , * 35 * that the corresponding model is stable and for ecnade model in power - law version ( class ii ) we have seen from figures * 34 * , * 36 * that the corresponding model is unstable . again for ecnade in logarithmic version ( class i and ii ) , we have seen from figures * 37 * , * 38 * , * 39 * , * 40 * the corresponding models are stable . thus we may conclude that our reconstructing echde model ( class i ) , ecnade model in power - law version ( class i ) and logarithmic version ( class i and ii ) are more realistic ( and classically stable ) than the discussed other models ( classically unstable ) . + * acknowledgement : * + one of the author ( ud ) is thankful to iucaa , pune , india for warm hospitality where part of the work was carried out .",
