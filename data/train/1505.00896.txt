    "if we will approximate @xmath219 by real - valued simple step functions , then it is natural to wait that under some `` nice restrictions '' on @xmath219 the solutions obtained by theorem 3.2 , will give us a `` good approximation '' of the solution of the required linear partial differential equation of the higher order in two variables with corresponding initial conditions ."
