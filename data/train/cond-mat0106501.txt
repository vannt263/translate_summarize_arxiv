    "carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) are ideal model systems for the exploration of electrical transport in low dimensions.@xcite two sorts of nanotubes ( nts ) exist : single - wall and multi - wall nts .",
    "an ideal ( undoped ) swnt can be either metallic or semiconducting , but here , we only focus on metallic nts . in these tubes ,",
    "the current is carried by two modes , modes , spin - degeneracy is not included . ]",
    "leading to a conductance of @xmath4 , provided backscattering is absent .",
    "recent experiments have shown that scattering within metallic swnt is weak . in a particular nice experiment",
    "the electrostatic potential drop along a voltage - biased nt was measured by using the tip of an atomic - force microscope as a probe.@xcite for swnts , most of the potential drops at the contacts .",
    "in contrast , for mwnts a considerable fraction of the potential drops along the tube , suggesting intrinsic scattering in mwnts .",
    "a length dependent resistance was deduced before from electric resistance measurements on multiply contacted mwnts.@xcite the typical value for the resistance per unit length is .",
    "we mention , that there is one conflicting results : frank _ et al._@xcite came to the conclusion that mwnts are ballistic conductors even at room temperature.d subbands is comparable to @xmath5 . ]",
    "seemingly compelling evidence for diffusive transport in mwnts is provided by measurements of the magnetoresistance , both in parallel and perpendicular magnetic field.@xcite for example , the resistance modulation in parallel magnetic field can be described very well by the altshuler - aronov - spivak ( aas ) theory ( weak - localization in a cylindrical conductor ) , which relies on _ diffusive _",
    "transport.@xcite these experiments did also show that the electrical current is preferentially carried by the outermost tube , at least at low temperatures .",
    "hence , a single nanotube is probed , albeit one with a large diameter of , which is about ten times larger than that of prototype swnts .",
    "as emphasized before , a metallic swnt is characterized by only @xmath6 @xmath2d - modes , a property that should be independent of the diameter .",
    "how can we than reconcile the availability of only @xmath7 modes for an ideal nt with the observation of diffusive motion .",
    "diffusive transport requires @xmath8 .",
    "may it be that mwnts are doped to a such a degree that @xmath8 ?    by using a new gating technique ( electrochemical gating ) , we have recently shown that mwnts are indeed ( hole- ) doped.@xcite the number of @xmath2d - modes is @xmath9 , but rather @xmath10 , see section  2 .",
    "mwnts are not single - mode , but rather few mode quasi - one - dimensional wires .",
    "whether they are @xmath2d diffusive , i.e. quasi - ballistic with a mean - free path @xmath11 exceeding the circumference @xmath12 , or @xmath13 diffusive is another question .    taking ( @xmath14 is tube length ) , yields which is of order of the circumference .",
    "this simple estimate is in good agreement with measurements of the energy - dependent tunneling dos @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath15 is not structureless , as would be expected if , but shows features reminiscent of quantization into @xmath2d - modes , albeit with some broadening.@xcite    recently , we have studied gate - induced conductance fluctuations in mwnts at low temperatures and tried to compare the measurements with ucf theory . in the regime of thermally - induced averaging ,",
    "i.e. for tubes which are much longer than the phase - coherence length @xmath16 and/or the thermal length @xmath17 , the functional dependence is in agreement with theory .",
    "these data allow to deduce @xmath16 , which follows nyquist - dephasing below .",
    "however , when we approach the universal limit , i.e. if @xmath18 , the temperature dependence of conductance fluctuations markedly deviates from standard theories .",
    "this has led us to study shorter tubes in more detail by measuring the differential conductance @xmath19 as a function of transport voltage @xmath20 and gate voltage @xmath21 in the fully coherent regime , i.e. for @xmath22 .",
    "displaying @xmath23 in a greyscale plot helps to recognize the underlying physics .",
    "this is in particular true for single - electron charging effects which might be present simultaneously to quantum interference effects , both modulating the equilibrium conductance .",
    "single - electron charging effects ( single - electron tunneling = set ) , such as coulomb blockade and coulomb oscillations were observed in swnts from the beginning.@xcite however , in our own work on mwnts we have never observed clear evidence of coulomb blockade until now .",
    "we have argued that this absence is due to the low - ohmic contacts in our experiments , which are always of order .@xcite in contrast , measurements on mwnts with high - ohmic contacts ( ) display the conventional features of single - electron charging effects.@xcite the evaporation of au over the nanotubes , the method we prefer for fabricating contacts , leads to contact resistances that can be as low as at room temperature .",
    "this is low enough to suppress set . at cryogenic temperature , however , contact resistances usually increase , so that set may show up . in section  3",
    "we present our first ( and still rare ) observation of set in transport through a mwnt with ` low - ohmic ' contacts .",
    "since the coupling to the contacts is rather strong , the conductance is dominated by higher - order co - tunneling processes .",
    "these new data allow to extract the single - particle level spacing @xmath24 of the mwnt quantum dot .",
    "similar to the result from electrochemical gating , the measured @xmath24 suggests that @xmath25 modes are occupied .",
    "in order to determine the degree of doping in mwnts ( or other nanotubes ) the position of the fermi energy need to be determined .",
    "one possible approach is to measure the conductance as a function of a gate voltage @xmath21 , which shifts the fermi energy @xmath0 .",
    "if the conductance @xmath26 increases ( decreases ) with increasing @xmath0 , the nt is n - doped ( p - doped ) , see fig .",
    "1a . at , or in the vicinity of the charge - neutrality point ( cnp ) ,",
    "the number of modes is minimal .",
    "it is @xmath7 for a metallic tube and zero for a semiconducting one.d bandstructure in fig .",
    "1a is considerably smeared , so that no abrupt transitions are expected if @xmath0 crosses a band onset . ]",
    "hence , one expects to see a conductance minimum ( or a resistance maximum ) if @xmath0 crosses the cnp .",
    "ideally , for an undoped nt , @xmath0 should lie at the cnp and the resistance maximum should appear at @xmath27 .",
    "if this maximum is observed at @xmath28 , the fermi level is shifted due to some doping . in order to deduce @xmath0 from the measured gate voltage ,",
    "the electrochemical capacitance between gate and nt needs to be known .",
    "conventional back gates ( see fig .",
    "1b ) have relatively low capacitance .",
    "consequently fermi - level shifts are small even for large applied gate voltages . in this case , the resistance maximum can not be measured , and hence , the doping level can not be determined .",
    "this problem is circumvented in our approach , in which the coupling capacitance is made very large .",
    "we immerse the nanotube into an electrolyte through which gating is achieved , see fig  1c . for details , see ref .",
    "very large gate capacitances are possible due to the large double - layer capacitance of the electrolyte nt interface .",
    "this has an important implication : because the double - layer capacitance is much larger than the electrochemical capacitance of the nt , the total capacitance ( series connection of the two ) is determined by the nanotube alone .",
    "hence , there is a one - to - one correspondence between gate - voltage change @xmath29 and fermi level shift @xmath30 , i.e. @xmath31 .    electrochemical gating is studied at room temperature on single mwnts with lithographically defined au contacts evaporated over the nts .",
    "the nanotube - contact structure is fabricated on degenerately doped si with a thick spacer layer .",
    "the subtsrate can be used as a conventional backgate , fig  1b . if , as outlined in fig .",
    "1c , a positive gate voltage @xmath21 is applied , the nt - electrolyte interface is polarized by the attraction of cations . consequently , the fermi level increases in the nt to maintain charge neutrality .",
    "an example for the dependence of the nanotube resistance on ( electrochemical ) gate voltage is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "a pronounced resistance maximum is seen at @xmath32 , which we identify as the cnp . in order to reach the cnp the fermi energy",
    "must first be raised by .",
    "this suggests that the nt is considerably hole - doped at @xmath27 .",
    "there is , however , a time dependence ( not shown).@xcite after immersion , the resistance maximum is observed at a smaller voltage of .",
    "the position of maximum @xmath33 then gradually moves to larger voltages to finally stabilize at in this example .",
    "hence , the doping level increases in the electrolyte . typical fermi - level shifts in air ( before immersion ) amount to .    based on measurements of the electrical resistance of swnts in a controlled environment of different gases",
    "it was suggested that hole - doping is induced by by oxygen.@xcite our own experiments show that oxygen has an effect on the doping state of mwnts . however , the effect is weak , as much larger doping shifts are seen in ambient air .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    ", we compare the evolution of the resistance of a mwnt at zero ( back- ) gate voltage when exposed to oxygen and air . prior to exposure",
    ", the nt was annealed at in vacuum . as a consequence of added hole doping the resistance",
    "is seen to decrease .",
    "the decrease is much more pronounced for air than for oxygen .",
    "the resistance increases again in vacuum , nicely demonstrating that the oxidizing species are only weakly adsorbed .",
    "the strongest source of doping is most likely due to water , as large fermi - level shifts can be induced by water vapour alone .    for the interpretation of previous electrical measurements ,",
    "the net doping concentration @xmath34 and the fermi - level shift for a ` virgin ' mwnt in air are important .",
    "typical values for the latter are . comparing this with the average @xmath2d subband spacing ( for a diameter nt )",
    ", we conclude that @xmath35 subbands may contribute to the conductance instead of @xmath7 for an ideal metallic nt .",
    "a doping - induced corresponds to a doping concentration of , or expressed per surface area to giving approximately one elementary charge per @xmath36 carbon atoms .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction single - electron tunneling ( set ) such as coulomb oscillations have been observed in mwnts and swnts , provided the contacts were high - ohmic , i.e. .@xcite in the opposite limit of relatively low - ohmic contacts of order charging effects have not yet been observed in transport through mwnts . though we have observed pronounced conductance oscillations as a function of gate voltage  @xcite and also as a function of magnetic field in the latter type of samples  @xcite ,",
    "these can not readily be assigned to charging effects , as the oscillations were strongly aperiodic .",
    "we have assigned these oscillations to quantum interference of non - interacting quasi - particles , with the interference being caused by the presence of randomly distributed scatterers .",
    "it may be that this interpretation need to be reconsidered , since we have recently observed set effects in mwnts low - ohmic contacts ( ) .    in order to entangle set from quantum interference",
    "it is useful to measure @xmath37 as a function of gate voltage @xmath21 and transport voltage @xmath20 .",
    "the obtained greyscale plots greatly helps to recognize the underlying physics .    in small ( semi ) isolated objects , like our mwnt devices",
    ", transport may be blocked by coulomb interaction ( coulomb blockade ) .",
    "this is the case , if the energy for adding a single electron to the tube ( the single - electron charging energy @xmath38 ) is larger than the thermal energy @xmath5 and if the object is only weakly coupled to external leads ( contact resistance @xmath39 ) . coulomb blockade is suppressed if the energy of two charge states are degenerate .",
    "for example , if @xmath40 , where @xmath41 denotes the total ground - state energy of the nt with @xmath42 electrons , an equilibrium current can flow via the sequence @xmath43 .",
    "such degeneracies can be induced by the gate voltage @xmath21 and appear in the simplest possible model ( constant interaction model ) periodic in @xmath21 . in swnts coulomb blockade has been observed by several groups before.@xcite until now , it was believed that mwnts do not display coulomb blockade because of low contact resistances .",
    "recently , we have observed clear signatures of single - electron charging in a long mwnt ( distance between the contacts ) with reasonably low - ohmic contacts ( i.e. contact resistance @xmath44 ) .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "4 . in ( a ) , measured for @xmath45 , a regular sequence is seen consisting of a large ` diamond ' followed by three smaller ones .",
    "this pattern suggests a four - fold degeneracy of the single - electron states which we assign to spin degeneracy and an additional twofold orbital degeneracy .",
    "the latter may be caused by a peculiar degeneracy inherent to the graphite lattice , the so - called k , k@xmath46 degeneracy which originates from the presence of two identical carbon atoms per unit cell .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , this is quite amusing , because this basic feature has up to now not been seen in swnts .",
    "4b shows @xmath37 measured at .",
    "now , an irregular sequence is observed .",
    "it is well known that the k , k@xmath46 degeneracy is lifted in magnetic - field .",
    "on the one hand , we do see clear signatures of coulomb blockade suggesting low transparent contacts . on the other hand ,",
    "the measured two - terminal resistance is low , of order of @xmath47 , suggesting highly ( or intermediate ) transparent contacts .",
    "therefore , higher - order tunneling processes can play an important role in the electrical transport .",
    "a well known higher - order tunneling process is the kondo effect , i.e. the dynamic screening of the spin on the dot due to exchange - correlation effects between the dot state and the electrodes .",
    "we observe the kondo effect in a mwnt for the first time , see the features in fig .",
    "4 . , which are highlighted by arrows . at @xmath48 and within the region of coulomb blockade",
    "there are two ` ridges ' of enhanced conductance . for the simplest filling scheme , i.e. @xmath49",
    ", these ridges are expected to form in every second ` diamond ' where the spin is @xmath50 .",
    "the kondo effect has been observed before in swnts.@xcite    the data in fig .  4",
    "allow to extract the single - particle level spacing @xmath24 .",
    "the large diamonds are large because an electron has to be added to a new level .",
    "the addition energy is therefore the sum of charging energy @xmath51 and @xmath24 . due to the fourfold degeneracy ,",
    "the addition energy for the next three electrons is only @xmath51 .",
    "comparing the energies leads to a mean level spacing of .",
    "the @xmath52d level spacing is predicted to be for one mode , yielding ( ) . the number of modes participating is therefore .",
    "again we see that there are more than @xmath7 modes occupied in mwnts .. ]    since the measured two - terminal conductance @xmath53 , is a typical value for all our mwnt devices with contact separation @xmath54 nm . ]",
    "the mean transmission probability @xmath55 per mode is only @xmath56 ( here , we have taken @xmath57 ) . if all modes would have @xmath58 , co - tunneling effects like the kondo effects could safely be neglected .",
    "hence , there must be a distribution of transmission eigenvalues similar to that in many - mode diffusive wires .",
    "for the latter , random - matrix shows that the distribution is bimodal .",
    "although we are dealing with a very small ensemble ( only 10 modes ) , the distribution of transmission values is most likely bimodal , too .",
    "though there are @xmath25 modes available to accommodate charge , charge transport to the contacts is determined by only one mode ( or a very small number of modes ) .",
    "if the mode with highest transmission probability has the appropriate @xmath55 ( not too low , but also not too high ) , the kondo effect will show up.@xcite if @xmath55 is larger , the observed conductance pattern can no longer be assigned to co - tunneling set effects but rather reflects fabry - perot type interference.@xcite",
    "multi - wall nanotubes in air are hole doped , most likely induced by the adsorption of water",
    ". consequently , there are more than two @xmath2d - modes occupied .",
    "a typical number is @xmath59 , not counting spin degeneracy .",
    "estimates for the scattering mean - free path @xmath11 vary widely in the literature and also among our own experiments .",
    "however , surprisingly many experiments suggests that the @xmath11 is of order of the circumference of the tube .",
    "this may be a coincidence , but might also have a deeper reason : it was pointed out very early by white _",
    "et al._@xcite that the mean - free path should grow with tube diameter @xmath60 according to @xmath61 , provided the number of scatterers per unit length is constant . on the other hand ,",
    "if we assume that the source of scattering is a direct consequence of doping , the scattering density is proportional to the doping density which for a given environment can be taken to be constant .",
    "therefore , the number of dopants per unit length ( or the number of scatterers ) grows linearly with @xmath60 .",
    "the combination of both effects results in a diameter independent mean - free path .",
    "another argument for a diameter - independent mean - free path in mwnts was put forward by egger and gogolin.@xcite    at low temperature , single - electron tunneling ( set ) effects have been observed in mwnts with low - ohmic contacts , i.e. .",
    "this has allowed to determine the single electron level spacing which appears to be consistent with the estimated number of occupied modes deduced from electrochemical gating .",
    "the presence of co - tunneling points to high transmission at the contacts .",
    "even stronger : the prevailing absence of set effects in mwnts with @xmath53 suggests that at least one highly transmissive channel is present at low temperature .",
