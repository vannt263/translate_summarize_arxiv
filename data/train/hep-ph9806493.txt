    "the analytical perturbative approach to multiparticle production in jets @xcite is widely used to describe inclusive observables in @xmath0 annihilation . in this framework ,",
    "a parton cascade is evolved down to small scales of a few hundred mev for the transverse momentum cutoff @xmath1 , and partonic predictions are directly compared to hadronic observales , according to the notion of local parton hadron duality ( lphd ) @xcite .",
    "the description of the parton cascade is given within the so - called modified leading logarithmic approximation ( mlla ) , which takes into account the leading double logarithmic and next to leading single logarithmic terms ; in this approximation , qcd coherence is included by means of angular ordering , and the running of the coupling @xmath2 at one - loop level and energy conservation effects are included as well .",
    "this approach has been applied to a large variety of experimental data and found to be rather successful ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . in particular , by considering predictions which fully take into account the effects of the energy conservation law , a quantitative description of available experimental data for single particle observables , like for instance the momentum spectrum @xcite and both the jet and the particle multiplicity  @xcite , has been achieved . however , in the case of observables related to genuine multiparticle correlations , like factorial cumulants and factorial moments of the multiplicity distributions , the available theoretical predictions  @xcite , which include only partially the energy conservation effects , do not quantitatively reproduce the experimental data@xcite .    in this letter",
    "we extend the results of  @xcite for the average multiplicity and we present a numerical solution of the complete mlla evolution equation of qcd for factorial moments of any order with the full inclusion of energy conservation effects . in this way , we can quantitatively describe within the purely perturbative approach recent experimental data on multiparticle correlations both in single quark and gluon jets and in @xmath0 annihilation , thus lending further support to the analytical perturbative approach to multiparticle production .",
    "in order to study genuine multiparticle correlations in a quark or gluon jet , it is convenient to study the properties of the ( unnormalized ) factorial moments of order @xmath3 , given in terms of the multiplicity distribution @xmath4 by @xmath5 and the ( unnormalized ) factorial cumulants of order @xmath3 , related to the factorial moments by a cluster expansion : @xmath6 factorial moments and factorial cumulants are integrals of @xmath3-particle inclusive distributions and @xmath3-particle correlations functions , respectively .",

    ", an improved description of data in the low @xmath43 energy region could be achieved@xcite .",

    "compares the data for factorial cumulants of order @xmath3 = 2 up to 5 in single quark jets of 45.6 gev and single gluon jets of 41.8 gev with the predictions computed in this paper and with the predictions of @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the full inclusion of energy conservation is very important for these observables and that , by including this effect , the perturbative approach can quantitatively describe experimental data in this configuration .",
    "it is also possible to obtain predictions for high order moments in single quark and gluon jets .",
    "predictions for the ratio @xmath51 inside single quark and gluon jets up to order 18 are shown in table  2 .",
    "it is particularly interesting to notice that oscillations of the @xmath51 moments are up to two orders of magnitude larger in quark jets than in gluon jets .",
    "2 shows the dependence on @xmath52 of the second order normalized factorial moment @xmath53 .",
    "experimental data@xcite are compared with the leading@xcite and next - to - leading predictions@xcite and with our predictions , where the result for the full event has been obtained from the prediction for a single quark - jet according to eq .",
    "( [ twohem ] ) in the following way : @xmath54 also in this case , our improved description is in quantitative agreement with the experimental data and reaches an accuracy comparable to the widely used monte carlo generators .    in order to investigate whether our predictions give a good description of correlations of yet higher order as well ,",
    "we have also compared them with the data for the ratio of factorial cumulants over factorial moments , @xmath51 , as a function of the order @xmath3 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that an important part of the oscillatory behaviour of the @xmath51 moments actually comes from the superposition of two different samples of two - jet and multi - jets events , an effect which is not taken into account in our simple treatment of correlations between the two hemispheres according to  ( [ twohem ] ) . at the moment , we can not then aim at a description of data for the whole @xmath0 annihilation events  @xcite , which requires an improved treatment of the composition of the two hemispheres , but we should look at data for two - jet events only . we have therefore compared in fig .  3 our predictions with data for the @xmath51 moments extracted as in @xcite from experimental data@xcite on multiplicity distributions in three samples of two - jet events , defined according to the jade jet finder algorithm with three different values of the jet resolution parameter @xmath55 .",
    "one can easily see that the theory can describe the gross features of the data for correlations of arbitrary order as well . in this case , a more quantitative comparison should not be pursued , since data have been extracted by using a different jet finder algorithm than the one used in the theory .",
    "we have numerically solved the qcd evolution equations in mlla for factorial moments of any order in quark and gluon jets , by fully taking into account the effects of energy conservation law . by keeping the same parameters previously fixed in order to describe the mean jet and particle multiplicities , a quantitative description of existing data on factorial moments , factorial cumulants and their ratio",
    "both in single quark and gluon jets and in the two - jet sample of @xmath0 annihilation has been achieved .",
    "the analytical perturbative approach , based on perturbative qcd description of parton evolution assuming local parton hadron duality , is then shown to be quantitatively successful in describing genuine multiparticle correlations inside jets .",
