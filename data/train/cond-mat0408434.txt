    "recent investigations@xcite with a scanning force microscope produced evidence , that the spatial distribution of the dissipative current , carried by a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2d eg ) in a hall bar under the conditions of the quantized hall effect ( qhe ) , is dominated by the existence of incompressible strips ( iss ) , which are expected to develop in the space regions where an integer number of landau levels ( lls ) is filled.@xcite subsequent theoretical work,@xcite which calculated electron density and electrostatic potential within a self - consistent thomas - fermi - poisson approximation , and current density and position - dependent electrochemical potential from a local version of ohm s law , confirmed the experimental evidence and found that the current flows in the iss , in which the local longitudinal resistivity vanishes . due to the thomas - fermi approximation ( tfa )",
    ", incompressible strips were found for all values @xmath0 of the magnetic field below a threshold @xmath1 , at which the center of the sample becomes incompressible.@xcite this leads to a vanishing total resistance for @xmath2 , to a potential drop in several steps across iss , which may coexist near a sample edge , and , for @xmath2 , to the absence of @xmath0 intervals with linear variation of the hall potential across the sample .",
    "these shortcomings are not in agreement with experiment@xcite and require an improvement of the model.@xcite",
    "we have recently improved on the approach of gven and gerhardts@xcite in two essential respects@xcite .",
    "first , replacing the tfa by a hartree - type approximation , which takes the finite extent of wavefunctions into account , we demonstrate that the existence of incompressible strips is restricted to finite @xmath0 intervals below @xmath1@xcite .",
    "second , we relax the assumption of a strictly local relation between conductivity and electron density , which leads to singular current density even along isolated lines of integer ll - filling factors , and we simulate non - local effects by a suitable averaging of the local conductivity tensor@xcite .    following the previous work,@xcite",
    "we calculate density profile and effective confinement potential of the 2d eg in thermal equilibrium self - consistently . assuming that all charges , including a homogeneous positive background and induced charges on gates , defining the hall bar ( in @xmath3 ) , are concentrated on the plane @xmath4 with translation invariance in @xmath5-direction",
    ", we calculate the potential @xmath6 from the electron density @xmath7 solving poisson s equation under suitable boundary conditions.@xcite electrostatic self - consistency requires that the density of the spin - degenerate 2d eg is calculated from n_el(x)= dx_0 _ n=0^ , [ geneled ] where @xmath8 is the magnetic length , @xmath9 a center coordinate , @xmath10 the electrochemical potential . the energy eigenvalues @xmath11 and eigenfunctions @xmath12 should be calculated from the single - electron schrdinger equation with the confinement potential @xmath6 . in the previous work one assumed @xmath6 to vary slowly on the scale @xmath13 and",
    "evaluated eq.([geneled ] ) in the tfa , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , neglecting the extent of the wavefunctions.@xcite    @xmath16    @xmath16    this yields flat iss in the density profile with local filling factor @xmath17 for all magnetic - field values @xmath18 , with @xmath19 for all @xmath20 , etc .",
    "this is , however , an artifact of the tfa . if one takes the width @xmath21 of the wavefunctions into account , e.g. in the full hartree approximation , one finds that the iss calculated in the tfa are smeared out if their width becomes smaller than @xmath21 .",
    "this is already seen for the `` quasi - hartree approximation '' ( qha ) , which uses again @xmath14 but replaces the @xmath12 by the landau wavefunctions of the unconfined 2d eg , as is demonstrated in fig.[fig1]a and in fig.[fig1]b , which shows within the qha no iss for @xmath22 .",
    "the stationary state with an applied dissipative current @xmath23 was described@xcite by a local ohm s law @xmath24 , with @xmath25^{-1}$ ] , which allows us to calculate current density @xmath26 and driving field @xmath27 with the constant components @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and with @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , with @xmath32 the longitudinal and @xmath33 the hall resistivity .",
    "this yields the hall resistance @xmath34 and the longitudinal resistance @xmath35 : [ equ2 ]",
    "i = e_y^0 _ -d^ddx 1/_l(x ) , v_h= e_y^0_-d^d dx_h(x)/_l(x ) .",
    "the feedback of the applied current on the ( measurable ) change of the electrostatic potential@xcite was considered by requiring the stationary state to be in local equilibrium.@xcite here we consider only a linear response situation , in which the current - induced change of the electrostatic potential equals that of the electrochemical potential . to avoid spurious singularities of the integrals in eq.([equ2 ] ) along isolated lines of vanishing @xmath32 , i.e. integer @xmath36 , which are an artifact of the strictly local model , we average the conductivity tensor ,    @xmath16    @xmath16    over a length @xmath37 of the order of the mean electron distance ( fermi wavelength ) : @xmath38 starting with the self - consistent born approximation@xcite for the conductivity tensor of a homogeneous 2d eg , @xmath39 , replacing the filling factor @xmath40 by the local @xmath36 calculated within the tfa , and performing the spatial average , we find strips with vanishing denominators in eq.([equ2 ] ) only for iss which are wider than @xmath41 and survive also in the qha . if such wide iss with @xmath42 exist in a certain @xmath0-interval , they carry all the current ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig2]a ) and lead , for @xmath43 , to exactly quantized resistance values , @xmath44 , @xmath45 . for all other @xmath0-values the current",
    "is spread over the sample , and eq.([equ2 ] ) yields reasonable average values for @xmath46 and @xmath47 , as is demonstrated in fig.[fig2]b .",
    "in conclusion , the spatial averaging of the conductivity tensor , which simulates non - local effects and eliminates spurious singularities due to narrow iss , which are an artifact of the tfa and do not survive in a hartree - type approximation , represents an essential improvement of the theory and allows us to calculate reasonable results for the longitudinal ( @xmath47 ) and the hall ( @xmath46 ) resistance as continuous functions of @xmath0 , with high - precision plateau values in the @xmath0 intervals in which sufficiently wide iss exist .",
    "furthermore , we find three different types of the variation of the hall potential across the sample ( fig.[fig3 ] ) , in excellent agreement with the experiments.@xcite"
