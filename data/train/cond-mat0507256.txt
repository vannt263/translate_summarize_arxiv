    "since their experimental realization in 1995 @xcite , bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) have become one of the most exciting fields in physics . because the high degree of control and the good understanding of the microscopic physics involved , they provide an excellent opportunity to investigate various issues in atomic and molecular physics , quantum optics , solid state physics and even high energy physics and cosmology @xcite .",
    "the interest in these systems is also boosted by its possible use in the implementation of quantum information processing ( qip)@xcite . cold neutral atoms in optical lattices are a naturally scalable system , and because of the weak coupling to the environment long decoherence times are expected .",
    "there are detailed proposals on how to build quantum gates @xcite and qubit buses @xcite to exchange information between different locations .",
    "all these properties make these systems a promising candidate for qip .    in most proposals ,",
    "the physical qubit is a single atom which may be in one of two preferred hyperfine states .",
    "this implies a strict control of the number of atoms per site , which in principle may be achieved by driving the system deep into the mott insulator ( mi ) regime @xcite .",
    "however , the gas is usually first condensed in a trap , and then the lattice is imprinted on it .",
    "this implies driving the system through the superfluid ( sf ) - insulator transition . as with other phase transitions",
    ", we expect the particle distribution will be determined by events at or just below the critical point ; once the hopping parameter is low enough , this distribution will be simply frozen in @xcite .    to amplify this important point , we observe that it is expected both landau and beliaev damping will be strongly suppressed in the mott regime @xcite ; this means that the equilibration times will grow sharply as we cross from the superfluid to the insulator phases .",
    "the pattern of correlations among different sites and particle number fluctuations will get frozen once the relaxation time is long compared with the characteristic time in which the parameters of the model are being changed . unless this change is made very slowly",
    ", this will happen soon after entering the mott regime . in this `` diabatic '' transition",
    ", the likelihood of a vacancy or of a multiply occupied site will correspond to those of a lattice near the critical point , rather than to the parameters of the operating regime .",
    "the goal of this paper is to formulate an analytical model for a cold bosonic gas on an optical lattice ( with densities of the order of @xmath0 particle per site ) targeting the critical regime of the bec superfluid - mott insulator transition @xcite .",
    "we focus on the computation of the one - body density matrix @xcite and its fourier transform , the momentum distribution which is directly obtainable from ` time of flight' measurements @xcite ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the expected number of particles with zero momentum may be identified with the condensate population , if it is close to the total number of particles .",
    "our main result is an analytic expression for this observable , interpolating between the known results valid for the two regimes separately : the standard bogoliubov approximation valid in the superfluid regime @xcite and the strong coupling perturbation theory valid in the mott regime @xcite .",
    "comparison of our analytic results with exact numerical solutions for @xmath1 particles in a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath2 sites shows that unlike the standard bogoliubov and strong coupling perturbation our analytic solution sustains an uniform accuracy throughout .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath1 particles distributed over @xmath3 lattice sites , with an integer mean occupation number @xmath4 . in terms of the creation and destruction",
    "operators @xmath5 and @xmath6 the dynamics is described by the bose - hubbard hamiltonian ( bhm ) @xcite    @xmath7    where the first term describes hopping between sites , and the second term the in - site repulsion between particles .",
    "the matrix @xmath8 is equal to @xmath9 if the sites @xmath10 and @xmath11 are nearest neighbors , and zero otherwise .",
    "when the repulsion term dominates , the ground state of the system has definite occupation numbers for each site , and weak correlations among different sites .",
    "the system is in the so - called mott insulator ( mi ) phase .",
    "when the hopping term dominates , atoms condense into a single quantum state extended over the whole lattice ; the system is in the superfluid ( sf ) phase .    in this paper",
    "we shall focus on the calculation of the one - body density matrix    @xmath12    and its fourier transform    @xmath13    @xmath14 is the expected total number of particles with momentum @xmath15 ( in units of @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the lattice spacing ) .",
    "@xmath18 may be identified with the condensate population .    in the  deep mott regime ( @xmath19 ) ,",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 is the same for all modes . in the opposite limit ( @xmath22 )",
    "@xmath23 for every pair of sites and @xmath24    our goal is to obtain analytic expressions for this observable in the intermediate regime @xmath25 with @xmath26 as well .      to motivate our perspective below ,",
    "let us begin with a brief discussion of some of the most common approaches to this problem in the literature and place our work in this context .",
    "we feel that other than the few full - fledged numerical calculations ( @xcite@xcite ) , none of the analytic approaches fully cover the transition regime described above . moreover , even if a numerical calculation is feasible it is useful to have a reliable analytic approach to match against",
    ".    to begin with , since our interest is @xmath27 , approaches based on the gutzwiller ansatz or mean field theory @xcite would not be sufficient .",
    "these methods are very powerful to investigate the phase diagram , but because they treat different sites as independent , they severely distort the one - body density matrix .",
    "these approaches may be improved on , of course .",
    "the gutzwiller ansatz may be taken as just the first step in a consistent perturbative expansion @xcite , and the mean field decoupling ansatz may be applied to full cells rather than individual sites @xcite .",
    "however , the required order in perturbation theory ( or the size of the fundamental cell ) to get a reliable result scales with the size of the lattice , and soon the difficulty becomes comparable to a full numerical solution .",
    "starting from the superfluid regime , the simplest way to get @xmath27 is the bogoliubov approach @xcite .",
    "since we shall consider the case in which the gas is at fixed total particle number , rather than fixed chemical potential , we must consider instead the particle number conserving ( pnc ) formalism @xcite .",
    "however , for the purpose of this preliminary discussion we may make abstraction of the difference .    a simple minded mean field approach , in which we simply replace @xmath28 by its `` expectation value '' @xmath29 , is bound to fail . since the bh hamiltonian has the global phase invariance @xmath30 in view of goldstone theorem the mean field theory must be gapless @xcite . in other words , simple- minded mean field theory can only describe the superfluid phase .    since the one - body density matrix is the time coincidence limit of the two - point function @xmath31 one could think of finding equations of motion for these functions directly , without including a mean field @xcite , but this approach also fails . in a nutshell ,",
    "the difficulty is as follows .",
    "the heisenberg equation of motion for @xmath32 is    @xmath33 = -\\sum_{i}j_{ij}a_{i}^{\\dagger } + ua_{j}^{\\dagger 2}a_{j},\\ ] ]    whereby    @xmath34    and we face a closure problem , namely , how to express the four point function in the last term in terms of two point functions . a typical resolution is a hartree - like scheme , where we approximate    @xmath35    however , in the weak hopping limit we expect the system will be close to the mi ground state    @xmath36    ( that is , each site is in a state of well defined occupation number ) where we can compute    @xmath37    @xmath38    we see the hartree approximation is off by a factor of two , even if @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "a possible way around this problem is to obtain a formal equation of motion for an object ( say a two point function ) for finite @xmath40 and @xmath41 and then approximate the coefficients in the formal equation ( for example , a self - energy ) by their exact value at @xmath19 or for very large @xmath9 , as needed @xcite .",
    "however , the actual expressions derived in this way are not reliable at the transition region , which is where our main interest rests .    in the opposite mott insulator regime ,",
    "the most straightforward approach is rayleigh - schrodinger perturbation theory in the parameter @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "however , the complexity of the calculation increases steeply with each increasing order , and so its accuracy for finite values of @xmath9 is hard to assess .",
    "comparison against exact solutions for @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xmath44 and @xmath45 shows that first order perturbation theory breaks down before the transition ( see below ) .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that perturbation theory breaks down when @xmath46    dilute gases with very strong repulsion may be treated as a free fermi gas @xcite .",
    "this approach has been recently successfully extended to densities @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "returning to our the above failed hartree attempt , it is clear that the closure problem arises in the @xmath40 term because it is  the nonlinear term , while the @xmath9 term is linear .",
    "one obvious alternative is to reformulate the theory in such a way that this situation is reversed .",
    "this is accomplished in the so - called slave boson /slave fermion method @xcite .",
    "the slave boson method requires the introduction of a large number of auxiliary fields and new constraints on the theory . in this paper",
    "we shall explore a similar strategy ( that is , making the repulsion term linear , the hopping term nonlinear ) while keeping closer to the original fields in the hamiltonian .",
    "one possible way to implement this is to observe that the interaction term is actually quadratic on the site occupation number @xmath48 , since @xmath49 .",
    "this suggests to consider as fundamental a `` phase '' variable @xmath50 canonically conjugated to the occupation numbers @xmath51 @xcite    @xmath52 = -i\\delta _ { ij},\\ ] ]    ( here and after we assume @xmath53 ) . the original creation and destruction operators",
    "are    @xmath54 \\sqrt{n_{i } }   \\label{mad1}\\ ] ]    @xmath55 .",
    "\\label{mad2}\\ ] ]    the implementation of this idea hits some well known difficulties @xcite . if the operator @xmath50 exists and is hermitean , then the operators @xmath56 are unitary and shift the state @xmath57 into @xmath58 . but",
    "such operators annihilate the vacuum state @xmath59 so they can not be unitary .",
    "we shall return to these difficulties below .    in terms of the density and phase variables ,",
    "the classical hamiltonian becomes    @xmath60 + \\frac{u}{2}n_{i}\\left ( n_{i}-1\\right ) \\right\\}.\\ ] ]    if we further approximate @xmath61 in the hopping term , then we obtain the quantum phase model @xcite .",
    "this model displays a phase transition , and it has been used to investigate nonequilibrium aspects of the mott transition @xcite .    on closer examination ,",
    "the approximation involved is valid when @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "therefore , for @xmath26 it fails at the transition region . in conclusion , while the quantum phase model is the best option on the shelf , it must be generalized to lower densities to be truly reliable in the relevant regime @xcite .",
    "one possibility is to allow for particle fluctuations , but only as far as any given site is never more than one particle above or below the average .",
    "then it is possible to map the problem onto the @xmath63 model or else use a path integral representation in terms of spin 1 coherent states @xcite .",
    "these model also display a phase transition , and a gross - pitaievsky description has been recently developed .",
    "however , we are not aware of attempts to carry the perturbative evaluation of these models to higher orders . below we shall explore an alternative strategy with the same overall goals .",
    "finally we observe that the so - called truncated wigner approximation and other phase space methods have been successfully applied in the @xmath64 limit @xcite .    from this description",
    "we see the lack of suitable treatment in the literature of the one body density matrix at the transition region for low densities . not only there is no single approach which is fully reliable throughout , but moreover those which are successful on one asymptotic regime are based on a quite different physical model than the ones which succeed on the other ( compare , e.g. , bogoliubov methods against the tonks - girardeau gas approach or strong coupling perturbation theory ) .",
    "a model which is able to describe the transition region within a single physical model and keeping an uniform accuracy would be a definite step forward .",
    "this is our aim here . to be fully understood , however , we must identify some desirable features any new approach to this problem must possess to be truly useful .",
    "as we mentioned above , our interest in this problem of the loading of bec atoms on to an optical lattice is motivated by the feasibility of using this process to initialize a quantum computer .",
    "this longer range goal sets certain constraints on the model which we choose to perform our analysis .",
    "the first consideration is that , although in this paper we shall only discuss the equilibrium case , in last analysis one needs a full nonequilibrium formulation of the problem . with this goal in mind",
    ", we adopt the schwinger - keldysh or closed time - path ( ctp ) @xcite formalism from scratch . as a side benefit",
    ", we shall see below that this choice is also helpful in overcoming the formal difficulties of the density - phase representation .",
    "a related requirement is that there should be a well defined way to carry the perturbative evaluation of the model to any order , but because this will be unavoidably complex , already the first order in the expansion must give sensible results . in particular , it is desirable to have the model in path integral language , as it is most adapt to further implementation of perturbation theory .    actually , the simplest quantum phase model formulation fails this test ;",
    "with some oversimplification , the problem is that @xmath65 is a bad approximation if @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "we shall seek a new set of variables in which the perturbative evaluation of @xmath67 is more accurate than in the original ones .",
    "we shall show this by comparing the first order approximation to our model with the exact solutions in the case of small systems , and to the pnc and strong coupling perturbation theories for larger densities .",
    "it is seen in actual experiments that collisions with noncondensed particles and loss are not significant except on the longest time scales ( above @xmath0s @xcite ) .",
    "therefore we shall consider the case of an isolated gas , i. e. , the total number of particles will be constant @xcite , as opposed to the case of a gas interacting with a particle reservoir , whereby the chemical potential remains constant .",
    "however , instead of the pnc approach , we shall develop a formalism which is more suitable to the path integral formulation of the model .",
    "we shall regard the given value of the total particle number @xmath68 as a constraint on allowed states of the system , rather than just a dynamical condition .",
    "the resulting theory will amount to an independent quantization of the system ; our model and the pnc one will agree only with respect to the time evolution of observables which commute with @xmath69 of course , @xmath70 is one of these observables ; not so the creation or destruction operators separately .",
    "a detailed comparison of the path integral and pnc approaches is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us observe that this procedure is less unusual than it may seem .",
    "for example , in studies of the ground state of the system , it is common to adopt trial wave functions which preclude site occupations farther from the mean than a few units ( a similar policy is sometimes adopted for the numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian ) . in practice , this means that the hilbert space of allowable states is constrained ; the reduction is actually more drastic than the one postulated here .",
    "a similar procedure has been implemented in the field of high temperature superconductors near the mott limit , to enforce such constraints as excluding double occupancy @xcite .    from the technical point of view",
    ", the advantage of taking the given value of @xmath1 as a hard constraint is that in the constrained system , the global phase invariance of the bose - hubbard model ( bhm ) becomes local in time .",
    "technically , the model becomes a gauge theory , with the constraint @xmath1 as gauge generator @xcite .",
    "this allows us to take advantage of the powerful methods of gauge theory quantization ( of which we shall only have a glimpse in this first take of the problem ) @xcite .",
    "when seen under the light of our stated long term goal , a number of shortcomings of our present work clearly stand up , and it is only fair that we mention some of them .",
    "first , to be sure we have an accurate description of the transition we should also compute other observables , such as the particle number fluctuations @xcite and the dynamic structure factor @xcite . we have only considered a homogeneous lattice , while a lattice superimposed to a harmonic trap would be more relevant to applications @xcite ( the presence of the trap has a drastic effect on the transition @xcite ) .",
    "we have not considered lattice fluctuations @xcite nor finite temperature effects @xcite .",
    "we have considered a condensate of atoms without internal degrees of freedom , while of course the internal structure is essential for qip @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to observe that some of the quantities we compute in this paper have been measured , both in one and three dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "we will comment briefly on these results in section vii ; a detailed discussion will be given elsewhere @xcite .    in spite of these unachieved goals ,",
    "the formulation of a fully analytic theory of the one body density matrix is a necessary first step towards constructing a realistic theory of the loading process , which we now proceed to tackle .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . over the next four sections ,",
    "we develop a formal presentation of the model . in section",
    "ii , we develop the ctp path integral representation for expectation values of bec observables . in section iii , this representation is translated to the density - phase representation . in section iv , we shift to a new set of variables , more suitable for the further perturbative evaluation of these expectation values .",
    "in section v we explore the simplest approximation , where the theory is linearized in the inhomogeneous modes .    in section",
    "vi we apply this machinery to the computation of the one - body density matrix and the momentum distribution function . in the final section vii",
    "we show the results of a comparison of our model against both exact numerical results and other approximated approaches , and conclude with some final remarks .    in appendix",
    "a we present a brief derivation of the other approximate approaches discussed in the results section , namely , first order perturbation theory in @xmath71 and the pnc approach to first order in @xmath72 this results are not new , and are included only to prevent any misunderstandings due to different notations between this and the original papers .",

    "the `` expectation values '' derived from @xmath93 are generally complex , even if @xmath76 is hermitian , and they do not evolve causally in time @xcite .",
    "the problem comes from the fact that they are no longer expectation values , but rather matrix elements between the asymptotic vacua @xmath94 and @xmath95 , which are not necessarily equivalent in this time - dependent situation .",

    "the exact solution was obtained by numerical diagonalization of the bose hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "we set @xmath404 and change @xmath40 from @xmath405 to @xmath406 .",
    "we have performed similar calculations for @xmath407 and @xmath44 sites , finding the results to be totally consistent with the @xmath2 case .",
    "the allowed values of momentum are given by @xmath408 @xmath409 where @xmath17 is the lattice spacing and @xmath15 is an integer . since by symmetry @xmath410 , there are only five independent occupation numbers , corresponding to @xmath411 ( the condensate ) to @xmath412 these are plotted in figs . 1 to 5 , respectively .    in these figures",
    "we have also plotted the occupation numbers as given by the pnc method ( bogoliubov ) calculations , and by first order strong coupling perturbation theory . in all the plots ,",
    "the solid - red line is our prediction , the black dash - dotted line is the exact numerical solution , the pink dots correspond to first order strong coupling perturbation theory , and the blue - dashed line to the pnc method .",
    "we see that for these small lattices our model fares worse than perturbation theory or the pnc approach in the corresponding limits of the deep mott or superfluid regions , but unlike these formalisms , it sustains an uniform accuracy throughout .",
    "it therefore achieves the goals set in the introduction .      in this paper",
    "we have presented an analytic approximation for the one body density matrix ( or equivalently , its fourier transform , the momentum distribution ) for a cold gas of structureless bosons in an homogeneous optical lattice .",
    "we have focused on the regime of low integer filling factor near the superfluid - insulator transition , which is not sufficiently covered in the literature .",
    "we have checked our results against exact calculations for small lattices , and against the theoretical predictions from the bogoliubov approach and first order strong coupling perturbation theory .",
    "our model interpolates between these theoretical alternatives , keeping an uniform accuracy in the transition region .",
    "our model works deep in the mi region , because it is built to be exact when @xmath413 .",
    "this is an advantage of our choice of variables over the usual density -phase variables . in the superfluid regime",
    "the model predicts that quantum fluctuations in the @xmath293 degrees of freedom scale like @xmath40 ( cf .",
    "( [ propagator ] ) and thus also qualitatively captures the decay of condensate population and the increase of non - condensate atoms .",
    "however , the agreement is not perfect . the qualitative but not quantitative agreement suggest that higher order corrections are required for a proper description of the physics . for observables like the number fluctuations at one site , which vanish in the mott regime according to the linearized approximation , for example",
    ", higher order corrections would be dominant .",
    "quantum corrections will also be important for the dynamic structure factor .",
    "there is no contradiction between the phonon spectrum of our model ( cfr .",
    "( [ phonspec ] ) ) and a gapped dynamic structure factor , because in the mott regime the amplitudes of the single phonon poles go to zero , while other poles arise because of higher order corrections .",
    "however , in this paper , we have not presented actual results for the particle number fluctuations nor the dynamic structure factor ; these must be included in the list of unfinished business we discussed in the introduction .    a preliminary comparison we made against available experimental results @xcite of the condensate fraction from an array of one - dimensional lattices contained within a three dimensional trap for variable @xmath414 showed fair agreement between the experimental results and the predictions of our model . in these experiments , the central tubes had around @xmath415 populated sites @xcite .",
    "the mean occupation number was close to @xmath416 near the center of the trap , and close to @xmath42 if averaged over all lattices @xcite .",
    "we have compared the experimental results to the predictions of our model for several values of @xmath3 around @xmath417 and filling fractions @xmath42 and @xmath418 the results are fairly independent of @xmath3 in this range , and very sensitive to @xmath419 instead . as a typical representative ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "6 the prediction of our model for the condensate fraction for @xmath420 and @xmath421we have superimposed the experimental results as reported in @xcite .",
    "we do not regard this as a validation of our model , since it was derived for a translationally invariant lattice and the parabolic confinement is not adequately included in our model .",
    "nevertheless , the agreement is encouraging and suggest that our model might be more suitable for trapped systems as in this case , in contrast to the commensurate translationally invariant lattice , there is not a sharp mi transition .",
    "we defer a detailed discussion to a future communication @xcite .    in summary , in our view , the most important contribution of this work is that it is the first step in the formulation of a quantum field theoretical approach capable of dealing with the intermediate regime . even though the agreement with exact numerical solutions is not perfect , we find it satisfactory because we are using only the first order approximation .",
    "it is a reasonable expectation that by including higher order corrections we might narrow the present gap .",
    "we are perhaps still a long way from a reliable , fully nonequilibrium model of the initialization process of a qip device based on cold atoms on an optical lattice , but from this work we have gained some confidence that we are moving in the right direction .",
