    "as has been known since bohr , van leeuwen and landau @xcite , edge effects play an important role in the physics of magnetized charged - particle systems in equilibrium .",
    "in particular , the diamagnetic response of these systems in the quantum regime is determined by electric currents flowing near the walls .",
    "the profiles of these currents , and of the closely related particle density , for a non - interacting magnetized electron gas near a hard wall parallel to the magnetic field have been investigated in detail @xcite , @xcite  @xcite .",
    "much less is known about the profiles in an interacting magnetized electron gas .    equally important for a physical understanding of the properties of an equilibrium quantum system",
    "are the correlation functions . for positions in the bulk of the system",
    "these have been studied extensively , both for a non - interacting magnetized electron gas and for its interacting counterpart . for the non - interacting gas",
    "the bulk pair correlation function can be determined analytically both for dilute systems at high temperatures and for dense low - temperature systems , in which quantum degeneracy effects are important @xcite . for the interacting electron gas information on the behaviour of the bulk correlation functions",
    "is more difficult to obtain . even for the non - magnetized case these functions have surprising properties .",
    "in fact , it has been demonstrated that the bulk correlation functions of the interacting electron gas possess slowly decaying tails with an algebraic dependence on the position difference @xcite .",
    "for the magnetized interacting gas similar methods have been employed to prove the existence of analogous algebraic tails , albeit with a different exponent @xcite .",
    "the correlation functions are expected to change near a hard wall . for a non - magnetized free - particle system",
    "these changes are easily determined by using a reflection principle @xcite .",
    "the problem becomes a lot more complicated when either interactions between the particles or a magnetic field or both are incorporated . in a recent paper @xcite the interactions between the charged particles have been taken into account in a model system consisting of two quantum charges immersed in a classical plasma confined by a wall .",
    "an algebraic tail in the pair correlation function of the quantum particles near the wall was found . however , the exponent governing the algebraic tail turned out to be different from that of the bulk correlation functions discussed above .",
    "the result corroborates earlier findings based on linear response arguments @xcite .",
    "the influence of a magnetic field on the surface correlation functions in the adopted model system remains to be studied .",
    "as the influence of a wall on the correlations in magnetized quantum systems is not yet fully understood , it appears to be useful to try and investigate the correlation functions for the relatively simple case of a non - interacting magnetized electron gas in the presence of a hard wall . in the following we present some new results for this system . in particular",
    ", we will analyze the correlations for the strongly degenerate case of high density and low temperature , where the influence of fermi statistics is important .",
    "both strong and weak fields will be considered , so that the number of filled landau levels can vary considerably .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with two sections that serve to prepare the ground . in section 2",
    "we define the relevant correlation functions for a system of independent particles and discuss their relation to the one - particle green functions .",
    "the pair correlation function in the bulk is considered in section 3 , where the influence of the magnetic field on the correlations is determined both analytically and numerically . after these preparatory sections we start considering the influence of the wall in section 4 . in that section",
    "we use the so - called ` path - decomposition expansion ' , which follows from a path - integral formulation , to determine the lowest - order corrections in the correlation functions at positions in the transition region , where the presence of the wall starts to be felt . an alternative way to determine these corrections is based on an eigenfunction expansion of the green function , which is the subject of section 5 .",
    "the asymptotic form of the correlation functions for large position differences is established in section 6 , separately for directions parallel with and transverse to the magnetic field . in section 7 the correlation functions for positions close to the wall",
    "are studied , again for both directions . in the final section 8",
    "some conclusions will be drawn .",
    "the equilibrium quantum statistical properties of a system of independent particles are determined by the temperature green function @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the inverse temperature , and @xmath2 and @xmath3 the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the one - particle hamiltonian @xmath4 , which is assumed to be independent of the spin of the particles .",
    "the reduced single - particle density matrix @xmath5 of such a system at inverse temperature @xmath1 and chemical potential @xmath6 is found by incorporating the effects of quantum degeneracy . for fermi - dirac particles one has @xmath7 where the spin degeneracy has been taking into account . the local particle density @xmath8 is the diagonal part of ( [ 2.2 ] ) .    for a completely degenerate system at zero temperature",
    "the reduced single - particle density matrix becomes @xmath9 with @xmath10 the step function .",
    "the diagonal part gives the local particle density @xmath11 of the completely degenerate system .",
    "the @xmath6-dependent green function , as defined here , is obtained from the temperature green function by an inverse laplace transform @xcite @xmath12 with @xmath13 .    the @xmath14-particle reduced density matrix @xmath15 follows from its one - particle counterpart by a symmetrized factorization : @xmath16 here the sum is taken over all permutations of the @xmath14 position vectors , with @xmath17 the sign of the permutation .",
    "the structure of the @xmath14-particle reduced density matrix has been analyzed quite generally for a system of interacting particles by using a path - integral formalism @xcite .",
    "the factorization property for a system of independent particles then follows as a special case .",
    "the argument is not changed by incorporating an external magnetic field and a hard wall that confines the system .    for the completely degenerate case a relation similar to ( [ 2.5 ] ) holds for @xmath18 .",
    "in particular , the diagonal part of the two - point reduced density matrix at zero temperature is @xmath19 often it is convenient to introduce the two - point correlation function @xmath20 in the following we will study this correlation function , and the influence of a magnetic field and a hard wall on its properties .",
    "we consider a system of charged particles which move in a magnetic field directed along the @xmath21-axis .",
    "the interaction between the particles is neglected . to describe the magnetic field",
    "we adopt the landau gauge , with vector potential @xmath22 .",
    "the particles are confined to the half - space @xmath23 by a plane hard wall at @xmath24 .    for positions",
    "far from the wall the temperature green function @xmath25 reduces to the bulk green function @xmath26 .",

    "we introduce the dimensionless variables @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",

    "the expressions ( [ 3.6 ] ) and ( [ 3.7 ] ) are particularly useful for strong fields when only a few landau levels are occupied .",
    "an alternative expression , which is useful for weak fields only , has been derived in @xcite . to study the limit @xmath48 in ( [ 3.6 ] ) , we return to the original variables , since measuring the distances in terms of the cyclotron radius , or the chemical potential in terms of the energy difference between adjacent landau levels , becomes meaningless for vanishing magnetic fields .",
    "the number of terms in the sum becomes large , as the upper limit is inversely proportional to @xmath49 at fixed @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , the argument of the laguerre polynomial gets small for fixed @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "hence , we can use the asymptotic form of the laguerre polynomials @xcite @xmath52 which is valid for @xmath53 .",
    "use of this approximation gives @xmath54    { \\sum_n } ' \\;j_0\\big(\\sqrt{2b(n+1/2 ) } \\ ,   { |{\\bi{r}}_\\perp-{\\bi{r}}'_\\perp|}\\big )    \\nonumber\\\\ \\times    \\frac{\\sin\\big[\\sqrt{2[\\mu - b(n+1/2)]}\\ , ( z - z')\\big]}{\\sqrt{b}\\ , ( z - z')}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for small magnetic fields .",

    "is @xmath64 .",
    "the two - particle correlation function in the bulk follows upon inserting ( [ 3.14 ] ) in ( [ 2.7 ] )    in figure  [ fig1 ] we have plotted the bulk correlation function for @xmath65 and for @xmath66 with @xmath67 and @xmath68 . for non - vanishing magnetic field",

    "@xmath76 , however , the correlation functions become fairly similar , both in the nodal structure , and in the amplitudes .",
    "as it turns out , these similarities are manifest already for @xmath68 , where the number of completely filled landau levels is still rather low .    comparing ( [ 3.14 ] ) with ( [ 3.6 ] ) , we see that , by turning on the magnetic field , the range of the correlations in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field becomes smaller , with a gaussian instead of an algebraic decay .",
    "in contrast , the range of the correlations in the direction parallel to the magnetic field becomes somewhat larger .",
    "in fact , although the decay remains algebraic when the field is switched on , the dominant contribution in the tail of the correlation function becomes inversely proportional to the square of the distance , whereas it is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the distance in the field - free case .",
    "introducing the wall at @xmath24 makes the temperature green function dependent on the distance from the wall , i.e.  the coordinate @xmath77 . in the absence of a magnetic field the influence of the wall on the green function",

    "the temperature green function becomes @xmath78 with the bulk green function ( [ 3.15 ] ) and the reflected position @xmath79 defined as @xmath80 .",
    "likewise , the @xmath6-dependent green function gets the form @xmath81 with the bulk green function ( [ 3.14 ] ) .    when a magnetic field is present , the influence of the wall on the properties of the system is more difficult to determine . in @xcite",

    "<S> equilibrium quantum statistical methods are used to study the pair correlation function for a magnetized free - electron gas in the presence of a hard wall that is parallel to the field . with the help of a path - integral technique and a green function representation </S>",
    "<S> the modifications in the correlation function caused by the wall are determined both for a non - degenerate and for a completely degenerate gas . in the latter case the asymptotic behaviour of the correlation function for large position differences in the direction parallel to the wall and perpendicular to the field , </S>",
    "<S> is found to change from gaussian in the bulk to algebraic near the wall . </S>"
