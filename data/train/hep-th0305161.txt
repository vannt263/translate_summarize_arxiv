    "this means that the time spent by the modes of interest in the region where the wkb approximation is violated is small . in turn",
    ", this requires a link between the two scales @xmath334 and @xmath148 which characterizes the shape of the dispersion relation and the hubble constant @xmath26 which characterizes the `` velocity '' with which a mode crosses the region where the wkb approximation is not valid .",
    "using the expressions of @xmath292 and @xmath335 , one finds that the link between @xmath148 , @xmath336 and @xmath312 can be expressed as @xmath337   \\biggl[-\\sqrt{2}+(\\alpha + 1)\\frac{k_{_{\\rm c}}}{h}\\biggr]\\ , .\\ ] ] if @xmath338 and @xmath339 , then one has @xmath340 , as expected .",

    "it is worth noticing that we have not assumed anything about the ratio @xmath317 in order to obtain the previous expression ( only the parameter @xmath312 was supposed to be small ) .",
    "the previous expression is the main result of this section .",
    "it should be compared with eqs .",
    "( [ minkops ] ) and ( [ dpsgw ] ) obtained previously .",
    "we see that the magnitude of the correction is no longer controled by any power of the ratio of two scales as it was before .",
    "the magnitude of the effect is determined by the time spent in the region where the wkb approximation is violated which in turn depends on the shape of the dispersion relation that was assumed .",
    "finally , let us return to the back - reaction problem .",
    "there is no back - reaction problem if @xmath347 .",
    "using the expression of @xmath297 derived before and assuming that @xmath348 , we see that the parameter @xmath312 must satisfy @xmath349 .",
    "this amounts to a severe fine - tuning of the scales @xmath336 , @xmath148 and of the hubble parameter @xmath26 during inflation in order to satisfy this condition .",
    "we have analyzed the magnitude of correction terms to the power spectra of scalar metric ( density ) fluctuations and gravitational waves in inflationary cosmology under the assumption that fluctuation modes are generated when their physical length scale equals some critical length determined by the unknown planck - scale physics , but without modifying the equations of motion for the fluctuations .",
    "the magnitude of the correction terms can then be expressed as a function of the dimensionless ratio @xmath350 , where @xmath351 is the characteristic hubble expansion rate during inflation , and @xmath1 is the mass scale at which the new physics sets in .    it is important to realize that the magnitude of the correction terms is in general different for gravitational waves and for scalar metric fluctuations - a point not realized in some papers on the `` trans - planckian problem '' of inflationary cosmology .",
    "in addition , the magnitude of the correction terms depends sensitively on the initial state chosen .",
    "we have shown that for the local minkowski vacuum state , the correction terms are of the order @xmath352 ( in agreement with the results of @xcite ) , whereas for nontrivial @xmath9-vacua the effects are much larger . if the bogoliubov coefficients which describe the mode mixing do not depend on @xmath230 , then the correction terms can be of order unity . in the case of danielsson s @xmath9-vacuum",
    "for which the bogoliubov coefficients depend on @xmath230 , the corrections to the gravitational wave spectrum are suppressed by one power of @xmath230 ( in agreement with the results of @xcite ) , the corrections to the scalar metric fluctuation spectrum by two powers of @xmath230 .",
    "thus , the consistency relation for fluctuations in inflationary cosmology obtains corrections of linear order in @xmath230 , as already emphasized in @xcite .    in the final section of the paper we compared the results obtained in earlier sections with the results obtained by assuming that trans - planckian physics leads to a modified dispersion relation . in this case , corrections to the usual power spectra of fluctuations can be obtained which are not suppressed by any small dimensionless combinations of energy scales in the problem . however , demanding that the back - reaction remains under control leads to severe fine - tuning requirements on such models .",
