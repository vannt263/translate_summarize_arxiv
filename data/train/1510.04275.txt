    "quantum spin models on the honeycomb lattice attract significant interest for several interrelated reasons .",
    "first are the proposals of exotic spin - liquid and valence - bond states @xcite together with a potential experimental realization of some of them in iridium - based compounds and other systems .",
    "@xcite second is the possibility of inducing various forms of magnetism in graphene structures.@xcite third is due to a number of intriguing order by disorder effects@xcite and unusual ordered ground states in cases when anisotropy and frustration are involved .",
    "@xcite    historically , the honeycomb lattice was also considered as a path to enhanced quantum fluctuations in the 2d spin models due to the low coordination number of nearest neighbors.@xcite the majority of theoretical studies of these models are devoted to the ground - state problem with the spectral properties receiving less attention.@xcite thus , the main focus of the present work is on the role of potentially stronger effect of quantum fluctuations in the spectral properties of the honeycomb - lattice spin systems , the subject relevant to a number of experimental systems that have recently become available .",
    "there is a significant variety of materials related to this interest , in many of which excitation spectra have been investigated by the inelastic neutron scattering.@xcite    in this work we present a consideration of the spectral properties of the nearest - neighbor @xmath1 model on a honeycomb lattice , in which frustration is induced by external magnetic field . while the ground state in this case is a fairly trivial canted modification of the nel state , it can be expected that the spectral properties may become rather involved due to the field - induced non - collinearity of the spin structure and to the concomitant decays of spin excitations .",
    "such an expectation is based on the studies of the decay - induced dynamical properties of the square - lattice antiferromagnets in a field,@xcite in which drastic modifications of the spectra and various forms of singular behavior have been documented .    in the present work ,",
    "we provide a similar systematic analysis of the decay - induced dynamics for the honeycomb - lattice antiferromagnets .",
    "although both the square and the honeycomb lattices are bipartite and thus one can expect a close similarity of the results , there are several important differences that make the honeycomb case significantly richer .",
    "first , the honeycomb lattice is non - bravais with two distinct magnon modes present . in an anisotropic case and for any value of the field ,",
    "the decays of the `` optical''-like mode into two magnons from the `` acoustic '' branch are kinematically allowed , while in the square lattice the field must exceed a threshold value for that to happen.@xcite then , for the square lattice , the @xmath2 mode is protected against decays as it is associated with the uniform precession of the field - induced magnetization .",
    "one of the interesting questions about the honeycomb case is whether the @xmath2 `` optical '' mode has a similar protection or it is allowed to decay .",
    "second , the honeycomb lattice is not inversion - symmetric with respect to the lattice points .",
    "as we will demonstrate , this feature complicates analytical aspects of the nonlinear spin - wave theory because of the complex magnon hopping amplitudes .",
    "it is also _ a priori _ not obvious what differences can follow from that . in addition , the dirac - like degeneracy points connecting magnon branches are present in the spectra of the @xmath1 model at the @xmath3-points of the brillouin zone , modifying kinematic consideration for the decays and for the associated singularities .",
    "lastly , due to a larger role of quantum fluctuations in the ground state,@xcite one can also expect a significantly enhanced role of the decays in the spectrum of the honeycomb - lattice models compared to the square - lattice case .",
    "we thus offer a comprehensive study of the decay - induced dynamical effects in the nearest - neighbor @xmath1 model on a honeycomb lattice in a field using the @xmath0 approach .",
    "one of the achievements of the present work is the formulation of the nonlinear spin - wave theory for the honeycomb - lattice models .",
    "while we ignore the contributions of the higher - order @xmath0 terms and of the non - decay corrections of the same order , one can still expect a qualitative applicability of our results even for the @xmath4 case , similarly to the problems studied previously.@xcite extensions of our consideration to the @xmath5 model as well as to the other cases can also be anticipated to retain main qualitative features of our findings .",
    "one can anticipate an immediate applicability of our results to realistic materials discussed in refs .",
    ", which exhibit ordered ground states .",
    "we expect that applying magnetic field will result in a redistribution of spectral weight according to the predictions of our work .",
    "next - nearest - neighbor interactions@xcite should not affect the results significantly .",

    "we would also like to note that the structure of the derived anharmonic terms bears a close similarity to the ones in the other models on the non - bravais lattices , such as kagome - lattice model studied recently,@xcite and we attempt to preserve a generality in the respective notations .",

    "the following treatment of the anharmonic terms in the hamiltonian expansion in ( [ eq_expansion ] ) is also similar , but requires additional care due to complex hopping amplitude ( [ gk ] ) and to the phase factors in the unitary transformation ( [ eq_phaseshift ] ) .    since we are interested in the decay - induced effects in the spectrum , we need to transform cubic anharmonic terms from the odd part of the hamiltonian in . after holstein - primakoff transformation ( [ hp ] ) it gives @xmath101 where we have introduced a shorthand notation @xmath102 fourier transformation   of the cubic term ( [ h3ij ] ) yields @xmath103 where @xmath104 and the off - diagonal elements , @xmath105 , of the dimensionless tensor are given by @xmath106 with the diagonal elements @xmath107 .",

    "one of the key differences of the present case from the previously studied systems is in the complex phase factors in ( [ gk ] ) , which originate from the lack of inversion symmetry with respect to the lattice points of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "we point out that the symmetric distribution of these phase factors among boson operators in ( [ eq_phaseshift ] ) is responsible for the compact and purely real or purely imaginary vertices @xmath118 in ( [ fcompact ] ) , which also translate to purely real or imaginary ultimate vertices in ( [ hsource])-([eq_decayvertex ] ) and provide a significant advantage for both numerical evaluations of the decay rates and for analytical studies of their asymptotic behavior .",
    "in this section , we discuss kinematic conditions for magnon decays , i.e. energy and momentum conservation that define whether the nonlinear , anharmonic terms in the spin - wave hamiltonian will lead to the broadening in the magnon spectra .",

    "this analysis can be performed independently of the actual calculation of the decay rates , based on the results of the harmonic approximation for the excitation energies , and is simply expressed as @xmath121 condition . while one can expect spectrum renormalization effects beyond the harmonic theory and also contributions of the higher - order processes to play a role , such a consideration is still immensely instructive .",
    "not only does it help to identify the regions where decays occur already in the lowest born approximation and thus are likely to be the strongest even if the higher - order processes are included , but it also provides an information on the presence of singularities in the spectrum , associated with the van hove singularities in the two - particle continuum , to which the single - particle branch is coupled.@xcite    a distinct feature of the present consideration is in having two branches of excitations , which makes multiple decay channels possible , so the general decay condition is modified to @xmath122 where @xmath123 and we will denote a particular decay channel as @xmath124 . more specifically , since , as is mentioned above , @xmath97 for any @xmath125 at any value of the field , out of nominally six potential decay channels",
    "there are only three that can be kinematically allowed in the @xmath1 honeycomb - lattice model in a field , one for the lower branch , @xmath126 , and two for the upper branch , @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "another , more subtle distinction of the present case is in the existence of the dirac - like degeneracy points between the two branches of excitations at the @xmath98 and @xmath99 points of the brillouin zone , which are also fixed at the energy @xmath100 , independently of the value of the field or anisotropy .",

    "decays in the @xmath127 channel are possible for any @xmath133 and @xmath134 ; see text . ]",
    "the decay channel for the lower branch , @xmath126 , bears a lot of similarity to the square - lattice case , although there are also some important differences .",
    "the main similarity is in the existence of a `` critical '' ( threshold ) value of the field @xmath130 at which decays become kinematically allowed .",
    "this boundary is related to the change of the curvature of the long - wavelength part of the spectrum vs field , which is also similar to the consideration given by pitaevskii@xcite to the phonon - like excitations in @xmath135he .",
    "considering the low - energy magnons and expanding @xmath136 in ( [ eq_energyspectrum ] ) near the @xmath137 point gives @xmath138 where @xmath139 is in units of inverse lattice spacing @xmath140 .",
    "a long - wavelength excitation becomes unstable towards spontaneous decays when the second term in the bracket is positive , corresponding to the positive , i.e. upward curvature of the spectrum . as is obvious from ( [ w1_curvature ] ) , in our case this happens for @xmath141 . using the implicit relation between the field and anisotropy via ( [ lambda ] )",

    "[ fig_phasediagram1 ] vs @xmath57 .",
    "we note that at the saturation field , @xmath129 , the decays _ are _ still kinematically allowed , but the fully saturated , ferromagnetic - like state forbids a direct coupling of the single - magnon and the two - magnon sectors , thus forbidding the decays.@xcite    [ sec_lowerbranch ] the next steps in the kinematic analysis are the studies of the extent of the region in the brillouin zone where decays are allowed for a given field and of the evolution of such a region vs field .",
    "these studies are based on a simple observation that the region where decays in a given channel are allowed must be separated from the region where such decays are forbidden by a _",
    "decay threshold boundary_,@xcite which , in turn , must correspond to a crossing of the single - particle excitation branch with the _ minimum _ of the two - particle continuum , e.g. @xmath145 for the considered @xmath143 channel .",
    "thus , the search for the decay threshold boundaries generally reduces to the search for the extrema of the two - particle continuum , determined from @xmath146 , which is satisfied when the two decay products have equal velocities , @xmath147 , where @xmath148 .",
    "this equation must be solved together with the energy conservation condition ( [ eq_channels ] ) . in fact , such a search yields more than just decay threshold boundaries , as it also provides contours ( in 2d ) along which the single particle branch meets the other van hove singularities of the two - magnon continuum , such as saddle points , which , generally , lead to singularities in the decay rate , see ref .   and the next section .    some of the typical solutions for the decay threshold boundary are:@xcite ( i ) emission of two magnons with equal momenta , @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is a reciprocal lattice vector , which gives an implicit solution for the contour in the form @xmath151 , and ( ii ) emission of an acoustic magnon , @xmath152 , which means that the velocity of the decaying magnon is equal to the velocity of the goldstone mode @xmath153 .",
    "in the considered case of the @xmath143 channel , the boundary of the decay region is determined by an emission of magnons with equal momenta , case ( i ) above , for any value of the field .",

    "[ fig_d1_region ] for @xmath154",
    ". decay region nucleates at the @xmath137 point at the field slightly exceeding @xmath155 and grows quickly with the increasing field . at about @xmath156",
    "there are no regions left in the brillouin zone where magnons are stable .",
    "since our analysis is based on the the harmonic spectrum , which depends on @xmath57 and @xmath16 via a single parameter @xmath53 ( [ lambda ] ) , a similar field - evolution of the decay region boundary is expected for all other values of @xmath57 .",
    "we note the differences of these results from the case of the square - lattice antiferromagnet.@xcite in the square - lattice case , the decay boundary at @xmath157 is partially determined by the emission of the acoustic magnon , case ( ii ) above .",
    "another important difference is that while in the present case the brillouin zone is fully taken over by the decays at @xmath158 , in the square - lattice case the decay region reaches all corners of the brillouin zone only asymptotically at @xmath159 .",
    "this difference originates in the structure of the high - energy portion of the lower - branch spectrum that has dirac - like @xmath98-points at fixed energy , see fig .",
    "[ fig_spectrum ] , which are not true extrema , but have a cone - like dispersion in their vicinity .      in the considered case of the honeycomb lattice we have two branches of excitations . while magnons from the lower , acoustic branch are only able to decay into themselves , the upper - branch optical magnons have two channels of decay that should be analyzed separately .",
    "first of the two is the decay of the optical magnon into the optical and acoustic ones , denoted as the @xmath131 decay channel .",
    "similarly to the acoustic branch decays discussed above , the kinematic conditions for this channel are met only above a threshold field value , see fig .",
    "[ fig_phasediagram1 ] . by inspection , the first type of the decay processes encountered by the optical branch upon the field increase is the emission of the goldstone mode of the acoustic branch , similar to the case ( ii ) of the previous consideration .",
    "the first instance when such a decay is possible is when the velocity of the optical magnon anywhere in the brillouin zone exceeds the velocity of the @xmath160 mode of the acoustic branch : @xmath161 .",
    "navely , this condition should be first met when the slope of the dirac - like cone for the upper branch at the @xmath98-point matches the slope of the goldstone mode , see fig .",
    "[ fig_spectrum ] for guidance .",
    "however , the dirac cone has an anomalous dispersion , in which the linear term is followed by the @xmath162-term with the varying convexity , depending on the azimuthal angle as @xmath163 .",
    "because of that , matching of the velocities first occurs at a finite distance from the @xmath98-points and at particular angles .",

    "[ fig_d122_regions2 ] .",
    "there are two notable features of the field - evolution of the decay regions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_d122_regions2 ] .",
    "first , unlike in the @xmath126 channel , the decay - free regions of the brilloiun zone are eliminated completely only at the saturation field @xmath159 .",
    "second , the evolution of the decay threshold boundaries is far more intriguing . upon increase of the field ,",
    "only part of the decay boundaries is defined by the goldstone emission , as can be seen in the more peculiar shapes of the boundaries .",

    "[ fig_d122_regions1 ] for @xmath164 and @xmath177 , which shows a union of three types of boundaries .",

    "[ fig_d122_regions1 ] , these dirac - emission threshold contours correspond to strong singularities in the decay rate discussed in the next section .",
    "this is contrary to the goldstone - emission contours , which are associated with the vanishing density of states and correspond only to weak singularities .",

    "the difference from the previously studied models@xcite is that such an abrupt transition can happen _ within _ the decay region , i.e. for a part of the magnon spectrum which already has a finite lifetime .",

    "although our consideration is partially qualitative , one can expect that the massive spectral weight redistribution and significant suppression of the quasiparticle peaks together with the rather peculiar distribution of strongly and weakly affected regions in the @xmath219-space will survive a more rigorous treatment of the problem.@xcite        a different view on the unusual spectral features of the @xmath1 honeycomb - lattice antiferromagnet in a field can be gained via the constant - energy cuts of the @xmath273 , the approach often used in the modern inelastic neutron - scattering experiments . in fig .",

    "a very strong deviation from sharp quasiparticle contours , characterized by intense broadening and massive redistribution of the spectral weight into different regions of the @xmath219-space , together with the non - trivial character of such redistribution , can be observed for both energies in the set in fig .",

    "these results are general and should apply to various honeycomb - based systems and we expect future experiments in applied magnetic field on such materials to confirm our findings .",
    "to summarize , we have developed a formalism of the nonlinear spin - wave theory for the nearest - neighbor honeycomb - lattice @xmath1 model in a field and have provided a comprehensive study of the dynamical effects that are induced by the two - magnon decay processes in its spectrum at zero temperature .",
    "we have given a detailed analysis of important and distinct features that make decays of spin excitations in the honeycomb - lattice antiferromagnets significantly richer than in the previously studied cases , such as non - bravais nature of the system and the dirac - like points in the spectrum .",
    "in particular , the decays of the optical mode into two acoustic ones are allowed for any non - zero field , while the other decay channels , such as acoustic into two acoustic or optical into a mix of optical and acoustic , require threshold fields to be exceeded .",
    "a separate degree of complication is added by the dirac - like degeneracy points connecting magnon branches that contribute to the intriguing field - evolution of the decay regions in the @xmath219 space , which has been studied in detail in the present work together with the concomitant singularities originating from the coupling to the two - magnon continuum .",
    "we have illustrated our findings by the maps of the field - dependent decay regions , singularity contours , and decay rates in all the channels for several representative values of anisotropy and field .",
    "we have also provided a meticulous analysis of the singularities in decay rates and have studied asymptotic behavior of the latter in the vicinities of the high - symmetry points .",

    "we have shown that the kinematic formfactors can modulate observed signal in different brillouin zones owing to the non - bravais nature of the system , thus offering a clear separation of the contribution from different modes .",
    "the main effects of the decays are in the clear and dramatic broadening of the quasiparticle peaks and in the strong spectral weight redistribution .",
