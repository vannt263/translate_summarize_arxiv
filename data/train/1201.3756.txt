    "the interaction of vector mesons with the baryon octet using the hidden gauge formalism , produces nine resonances dynamically generated , degenerate in @xmath173 , which can be associated to states of the pdg .",
    "however the results show that the theoretical widths are significantly smaller than the experimental ones .",
    "so , one could think that there is something else involved in the vector meson - baryon octet interaction .",
    "since , pseudoscalar mesons couple both , to vectors and baryons , one can think that it is possible that the interaction is mediated not only by a vector exchange but also by a pseudoscalar exchange .",
    "we found a mechanism , the box diagram involving @xmath174 in two vertices , which is common to @xmath1 and @xmath68 and gives the same contribution in both cases .",
    "in addition to this mechanism , there are other ones involving a contact term ( vertex correction of the kroll - ruderman type ) which only contribute for @xmath1 , thus breaking the original degeneracy between these states .",
    "the box diagram gives a relatively small contribution , but the terms involving the contact term are more important , producing a widening of the resonance and some times a small shift to smaller energies .",
    "in particular we found very rewarding that this splitting leads to a good phenomenological result in the case of the @xmath141 and @xmath142 , which are well reproduced both for the masses and widths . the tendency to have a bigger width in the state of @xmath67 than in the partner with @xmath68",
    "is also observed in the low lying resonances . for higher mass resonances we noted the difficulty to establish a clean correspondence with particles in the pdg given the large fluctuation of results between different experiments .",
    "the study of the scattering matrix reveals that in fact the widths of the resonances found with this new potential , are bigger than the original ones , and are in a better agreement with the experimental results found in the pdg .",
    "also the couplings are studied , and although the real and imaginary parts are somewhat different from the original ones , the moduli remain very similar for most of the cases .",
    "the formalism done here could be extended to the complementary problem of studying the effect of the vector baryon channels in the resonances which are largely made of pseudoscalar - baryon channels .",
    "the interplay of pseudoscalar - baryon , vector - baryon and @xmath175-baryon channels is emerging also as a new experimental line in different reactions , like the photoproduction of @xmath100 close to threshold @xcite and @xmath176 photoproduction close to the @xmath100 threshold @xcite .",
