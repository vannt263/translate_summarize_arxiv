    "the consequences of the braneworld theory @xcite in general relativity have been studied with great interest during the past years @xcite ( see also a review paper @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "its possible effects on our observable 4d universe have been extensively studied through cosmological scenarios @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the study of the consequences in astrophysics @xcite has been mostly limited to the exterior region , even though it is well known that gravitational collapse could produce very high energies in the interior , where the braneworld corrections to general relativity would become significant @xcite ( see @xcite for a recent study of black holes on the brane ) .    in the astrophysics context , the general fact that a single 5d solution can generate different scenarios in 4d @xcite ,",
    "makes the analysis in the exterior region particularly attractive in searching for solutions beyond schwarzschild s .",
    "hence several scenarios which might be useful in predicting observable effects from the extra dimension can be considered . on the other hand , the study on internal stellar structure in the braneworld remains unknown so far .",
    "the reason is very simple : the internal stellar structure is more complex that any other scenario , thus the high energy and nonlocal corrections to einstein s field equation , which in general lead to a complicated indefinite system of equations in the brane , produce an even more complicated system of equations in the interior .",
    "hence the construction and eventual study of internal stellar solutions in the brane is a difficult process , except when uniform distributions are considered .",
    "consequently there are some important questions which remain without answer .",
    "for instance , the role played by density gradients as a source of weyl stresses , and its eventual consequence on the gravitational collapse remain unknown . an internal consistent solution would be useful in order to consider these issues .",
    "however , in general , finding a consistent solution in the brane , no matter which scenario is being considered , represents a challenge which final answer require more information on the 5d geometry and the way on how our 4d spacetime is embedded in the bulk .    there is a large number of studies on the consistency of braneworld models in the brane .",
    "for instance , the approach developed in the series of papers by mukohyama @xcite has been extensively used in calculating gravity perturbations in a braneworld scenario .",
    "early works on consistent linearized gravity @xcite , tests of consistency beyond linear order @xcite , stability and energy conservation @xcite , thus as low energy effective theory in the context of the braneworld @xcite-@xcite , have been extensively used as well . on the other hand , and from the point of view of a brane observer , there is an issue which must be faced in the search of any consistent solution in the brane ; namely , the non locality and non closure of the braneworld equations @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this is an open problem for which a solution requires a better understanding of the bulk geometry and proper boundary conditions .",
    "it is well known that the source of the non locality and non closure of the braneworld equations is directly related with the projection @xmath1 of the bulk weyl tensor on the brane .",
    "several ways have been taken to overcome this problem , most of them based in restrictions on the tensor @xmath1 . for instance a restriction which has proven to be useful consists in discarding the anisotropic stress associated to @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a different and more radical restriction on @xmath1 consist in imposing the constraint @xmath2 .",
    "however this condition , which was initially used in some papers , is incompatible with the bianchi identity in the brane @xcite .",
    "in this paper there will be no direct restrictions on @xmath3 . instead of this approach , the method developed in ref.@xcite shall be used to solve the non closure problem of braneworld equations .",
    "this method , based in the fact that any stellar solution on the brane must have the general relativity solution as a limit , is used in this paper to generate the first exact and physically acceptable interior solution for a nonuniform stellar distribution having local and non - local bulk terms on the brane .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "* 2 * the einstein field equations and matching conditions in the brane for a spherically symmetric distribution is reminded . in section * 3 * a regular and physically acceptable exact internal solution is found . in section * 4 * an analysis of the solution is carried out . in the last section",
    "the conclusions are presented .",
    "the einstein field equations on the brane may be written as a modification of the standard field equations @xcite@xmath4@xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the cosmological constant on the brane .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor has new terms carrying bulk effects onto the brane : @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the brane tension .",
    "the new terms @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the high - energy corrections and @xmath11 corrections respectively , and are given by @xmath12,\\ ] ] @xmath13,\\ ] ] being @xmath14 the bulk weyl scalar and @xmath15 and @xmath16 the anisotropic stress and energy flux respectively .",
    "we consider a spherically symmetric static distribution , hence @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a unit radial vector and @xmath20 the projection tensor with 4-velocity @xmath21 .",
    "the line element is given in schwarzschild - like coordinates by @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are functions of @xmath25 .",
    "the metric ( [ metric ] ) has to satisfy ( [ einst ] ) .",
    "in our case with @xmath26 we have :    @xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath30    where @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the general relativity is regained when @xmath33 and ( [ con1 ] ) becomes a linear combination of ( [ ec1])-([ec3 ] ) .",

    "the equation ( [ matchingf ] ) gives the general matching condition for any static spherical braneworld star @xcite .",
    "when @xmath33 we obtain the well known matching condition @xmath41 . in the particular case of the schwarzschild exterior solution @xmath42 , the matching condition ( [ matchingf ] ) becomes : @xmath43 thus the matching conditions do not have a unique solution on the brane .",
    "it is easily seen that the field equations ( [ ec1])-([ec3 ] ) can be written as @xmath44dr,\\ ] ] @xmath45 @xmath46 with @xmath47 @xmath48.\\ ] ] the equation ( [ usual ] ) actually represents an integral differential equation for the geometrical function @xmath49 , something completely different from the general relativistic case , and a direct consequence of the non locality of the braneworld equations .",
    "the only solution known for this equation is given as @xcite @xmath50dr,\\ ] ] with @xmath51,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath53 the function @xmath54 measures the anisotropic effects due to bulk consequences on @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath23 , and its physical meaning will be useful in the searching of exact solutions .",
    "this will be addressed in the next section .",
    "so far we have the interior weyl functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 plus the geometric function @xmath49 , respectively given by ( [ pp ] ) , ( [ uu ] ) and ( [ edlrwss ] ) , and three unknown functions @xmath59 satisfying one equation , namely , the conservation equation ( [ con1 ] ) . therefore it is necessary to prescribe additional information to close the system .",
    "first of all , to ensure the correct limit at low energies , the following constraint is imposed on the brane @xmath60 the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) has been proven to be useful in finding solutions which possesses general relativity as a limit @xcite , and has a clear physical interpretation : eventual bulk consequences on @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath23 do not produce anisotropic effects on the brane .",
    "this constraint ensures that a braneworld solution be consistent with general relativity , as is shown in ref.@xcite . unfortunately this constraint is not enough , and one additional condition must be imposed .",
    "therefore , from the point of view of a brane observer , many solutions are possible .",
    "however not all of these solutions are of physical interest .",
    "hence the brane observer has to impose a condition in the brane which must lead to a physically acceptable solution , namely , regular at the origin , pressure and density defined positive , well defined mass and radius , monotonic decrease of the density and pressure with increasing radius , etc .",
    "all these conditions reduce enormously the possible solutions @xmath61 to @xmath62 and @xmath63 , even more in the searching of an exact solution",
    ".    it might be logical to think of the schwarzschild condition @xmath64 to close the system .",
    "however this would produce a very complicated integral differential equation for @xmath24 , as can be seen through ( [ edlrwss ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it is clear that to find an exact expression for the geometric function @xmath49 , given by ( [ edlrwss ] ) , an analytic solution for ( [ i ] ) is needed . keeping this in mind ,",
    "a huge and simple family of exact solutions for ( [ i ] ) is considered , given by @xmath65 which is characterized by the constants @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the constants @xmath66 and @xmath67 are eventually found through matching conditions , whereas @xmath68 and @xmath69 are parameters to be used in the searching of an exact solution for @xmath70 and @xmath71 .    using ( [ regularmet00 ] ) in ( [ con1 ] )",
    "the pressure is found in terms of the density @xmath72 with @xmath73 a constant of integration .    now using ( [ regularmet00 ] ) and ( [ prev2 ] ) in the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) , the following integral equation for the density",
    "is obtained @xmath74 \\nonumber \\\\           & & - \\frac{12\\,\\pi \\ ,       \\left ( -2\\,b +         { \\sqrt{a}}\\,c\\,m\\,n\\ ,          \\int_0^r r^{-1 + m}\\ ,              { \\left ( 1 + c\\,r^m \\right ) } ^               { -1 + \\frac{n}{2}}\\,\\rho(r)\\ ,             dr \\right ) } { { \\sqrt{a}}\\ ,       { \\left ( 1 + c\\,r^m \\right ) } ^        { \\frac{n}{2 } } } \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{4\\,\\pi \\ ,       \\left ( 2 + c\\ ,          \\left ( 2 + m\\,n \\right ) \\,r^m",

    "it is important to stress that the goal of this paper is to find a simple exact braneworld solution , hence we are not interested in the most general solution @xmath71 to the integral equation ( [ intdiffeq ] ) .",
    "indeed , a particularly useful solution for ( [ prev2 ] ) and ( [ intdiffeq ] ) , leading to an exact braneworld solution through ( [ edlrwss ] ) , will be constructed .",
    "this is shown below .",
    "the first step is to examine the complicated bulk contribution to @xmath49 in ( [ edlrwss ] ) . when the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) is imposed to ensure general relativity as a limit , the geometric function @xmath49 underwent a great simplification , leaving only high energy corrective terms .",
    "then when ( [ regularmet00 ] ) is used , the complicated integral expression in ( [ edlrwss ] ) is reduced even more , leading to @xmath75 } ^     { \\frac{4 + n\\left ( m-3 \\right ) }       { 4 + m\\,n } } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left(\\rho^2 + 3\\rho p\\right)dr.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finding a physically acceptable exact solution for ( [ prev2 ] ) and ( [ intdiffeq ] ) , which can produce an exact solution for ( [ edlrwss2 ] ) , represents a difficult process . hence the integral expression ( [ edlrwss2 ] ) has to be simplified as much as possible . indeed ,",
    "the integral ( [ edlrwss2 ] ) is tremendously simplified when @xmath76 , leading to @xmath77 the next step will be to consider in ( [ prev2 ] ) a simple ansatz for @xmath71 which is capable of producing a simple expression for the pressure , and then to use ( [ intdiffeq ] ) to fix the parameters of the ansatz . the idea is to obtain a solution for both @xmath70 and @xmath71 as simple as possible such that the integral ( [ edlrwss3 ] ) has an analytic expression .",
    "if this is accomplished , the geometric function @xmath49 , given through ( [ edlrwss ] ) , and both interior weyl functions @xmath57 and @xmath14 , given by ( [ pp ] ) and ( [ uu ] ) respectively , will have exact expressions .    by simple inspection of ( [ prev2 ] )",
    "it is easy to see that a convenient ansatz for @xmath71 can be written by @xmath78 on the other hand , since ( [ regularmet00 ] ) must be regular at the origin @xmath79 , @xmath68 has to be positive .",
    "the constant @xmath69 , which is given by @xmath80 , is considered positive to obtain a pressure with a physically acceptable behaviour .",
    "thus in our case @xmath68 satisfies @xmath81 .",
    "taking @xmath82 and using ( [ ansrho ] ) in ( [ prev2 ] ) , it is found that @xmath70 has a relatively simple expression free of special functions when and @xmath83 produce a solution to ( [ prev2 ] ) having special functions .",
    "this special functions eventually would make impossible an exact solution to @xmath49 through ( [ edlrwss ] ) . ] @xmath84 hence the following expression for the pressure is found @xmath85 where @xmath86 the expression ( [ prev22 ] ) will hardly produce an exact function to ( [ edlrwss3 ] ) unless the logarithmic function be removed .",
    "thus , @xmath87 now using ( [ ansrho2 ] ) , the constraint ( [ intdiffeq ] ) is written as @xmath88 hence it is found that @xmath89    using ( [ constccc ] ) and ( [ constv2 ] ) in ( [ ansrho2 ] ) and ( [ prev22 ] ) , a simple and physically acceptable expression is found for both the pressure and density .",
    "thus the solution for ( [ con1 ] ) and ( [ constraint ] ) is finally written as and @xmath56 were found in @xcite for a perfect fluid in the context of general relativity .",
    "however the solution shown there is not physically acceptable due to @xmath90 .",

    "as can be seen by figure 1 , the scalar function @xmath0 is always negative inside the stellar distribution , with a maximum negative value at the origin @xmath79 .",
    "this situation may be explained through the general expression for @xmath0 , given by eq .",
    "( [ uu ] ) .",
    "it shows two `` sources '' for @xmath0 : the first kind given by the first two terms in the second hand side of eq .",

    "the second kind is given by the remaining terms , which clearly represent an anisotropic expression , which is always positive .",
    "hence when the anisotropy projected onto the brane is not high enough , the dominant high energy terms produce a negative scalar function @xmath0 , which is the case presented here .",
    "this negative scalar function reduces both the effective density and the effective pressure , as can be seen by the field equations ( [ ec1])-([ec3 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the anisotropy inside the braneworld star is shown by the figure 2 .",
    "it increases until reaches a maximum value , then decreases until @xmath103 at @xmath79 .",

    "@xcite .",
    "it was found that the weyl scalar function @xmath0 is always negative inside the stellar distribution . in consequence",
    "it reduces both the effective density and the effective pressure .",
    "on the other hand , the anisotropy inside the braneworld star , which is directly connected with the deformation underwent by @xmath24 due to bulk gravity effects , has an acceptable physical behaviour .",
    "the exact solution found in this paper was possible as a direct consequence of the constraint @xmath141 .",

    "furthermore , this constraint reduces the deformation of @xmath49 , leaving a corrective term proportional to high - energy effects of bulk gravity , as can be clearly seen through the equation ( [ edlrwss ] ) .",
    "since the constraint @xmath143 removes all possible sources of anisotropy except for the corrective term of @xmath49 proportional to high - energy effects , it follows that the anisotropic effect of the bulk on the brane is reduced to its minimal expression , hence the constraint imposed represents a _ condition of minimal anisotropy _ on the brane .",
    "the condition of minimal anisotropy , represented by the constraint @xmath54=@xmath144 , is not only a direct path to avoid the loss of the general relativity limit , but also a natural way to reduce the degrees of freedom on the brane .",
    "this is an enormous simplification which has proven to be useful in searching physically relevant exact solution on braneworld .",
    "furthermore , this method works equally for analytic as well for numerical methods .",
    "hence the condition of minimal anisotropy might help in the search of not only analytic physically acceptable , but also numerical solutions when a non - uniform distribution is considered .",
    "thus the role played by the density gradients as a source of weyl stresses in the interior could be studied .",
    "the work developed in this paper represents the point of view of a brane observer .",
    "hence the solution found here , a physically acceptable one , does not ensure that the bulk eventually constructed will not be plagued with singularities or any other problem .",
    "however , since the condition of minimal anisotropy on the brane ensures the correct limit at low energies , it could be used when the bulk configuration is investigated , thus some general features of the five dimensional bulk might be elucidated .",
    "this is currently been investigated .",

    "<S> in this paper the first exact interior solution to einstein s field equations for a static and non - uniform braneworld star with local and non - local bulk terms is presented . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the bulk weyl scalar @xmath0 is always negative inside the stellar distribution , in consequence it reduces both the effective density and the effective pressure . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the anisotropy generated by bulk gravity effect has an acceptable physical behaviour inside the distribution . using a reissner - nrdstrom - like exterior solution , </S>",
    "<S> the effects of bulk gravity on pressure and density are found through matching conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> keywords : general relativity ; braneworld ; exact solutions . </S>"
