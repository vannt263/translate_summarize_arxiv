    "so far , the nucleus was studied in the @xmath0tc @xmath4-decay @xcite , @xmath2ru(d , p ) reaction @xcite and @xmath5-capture on @xmath2ru @xcite .",
    "however , these reaction mechanisms are highly selective and populate only low - spin states . in the 1990s the high - resolution high - granularity multidetector @xmath1-ray arrays become available , which have enabled the use of induced fission reactions for @xmath1-ray spectroscopy , providing the opportunity to fill in the gap of transitional nuclei situated between the line of beta stability and the most exotic neutron - rich nuclei produced in fission . by using induced fission reaction , the intruder negative - parity band in @xmath0ru was observed for the first time and extended to @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the present work reports on new results for @xmath0ru , obtained also from induced fission .",
    "two positive - parity bands were observed on top of the known @xmath7 and @xmath8 states , which help to parametrize the rigid - triaxial - rotor - plus - particle model and test its applicability to the low - lying low - spin states observed prior to our study in @xmath0ru .",
    "@xmath0ru was produced as a fission fragment in the disintegration of the @xmath9pb compound nucleus , which was synthesized in the @xmath10si+@xmath11er reaction at a beam energy of @xmath12si)=142 mev . in order to stop the recoils ,",
    "the 1.15 mg/@xmath13 thick @xmath14er target was deposited on a 9 mg/@xmath13 gold backing .",

    ", the branching ratios from the adopted gammas will be used in these cases .",
    "the spin and parity ( @xmath38 ) assignments to the states , below the 230-kev level , are based on the @xmath4-decay feeding @xcite , on the decay branches of primary transitions observed from the @xmath5-capture state at 5.9 mev @xcite , the @xmath39 transfer in @xmath40 reaction @xcite and the @xmath1-decay pattern to states with known spins and parities .",

    "the @xmath38 assignments in the present work are also supported by the systematics of the positive - parity states in the ru isotopic chain . only @xmath41 and @xmath42 nature is assumed for the prompt @xmath1-rays above the @xmath7 state .",
    "given that the induced fission reaction populates mainly yrast states , it can be expected that at moderate and high energies there will be a little overlap between the states produced in the present experiment and in the @xmath4-decay or @xmath5-capture primary transitions .",

    ".  @xcite .",
    "thus , for example a 466-kev level is reported from @xmath4-decay , @xmath2ru@xmath40 and @xmath2ru(@xmath30 ) data . there",
    ", the level decays via a branch of four transitions with energies of 307 , 358 , 446 , and 466 kev to levels with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath33 .",
    "also , the 466-kev level is fed by a primary transition from the @xmath49 @xmath5-capture state at 5.9 mev which constrains the possible @xmath38 assignments to @xmath47 and @xmath48 , with the last one being adopted in ref .",
    "in contrast , the 466-kev level , observed in the present study , decays via a strong 235-kev transition in addition to the main 357-kev decay branch and the 307 and 466-kev decay branches were not observed at all .",
    "therefore the state , observed in the present study , is tentatively interpreted as a @xmath50 state , different from the low - spin 466-kev level known prior our work .",
    "a similar situation occurs for the 670-kev level , which is observed to decay via 204 and 440-kev transitions in the present study , while in ref .",
    "@xcite the level at 670 kev is de - excited by 398 and 563-kev transitions .",
    "again , the low - spin assignment to the 670-kev level in nndc is based on the feeding from the @xmath5-capture state at 5.9-mev via a 5.24-mev primary transition .",
    "in contrast to the nndc data , the 670-kev level in the present study decays to the @xmath32 and @xmath51 states which , along with the assumption that it is an yrast state , leads to @xmath52 assignment to this level .    before closing this section , we should note that the intensity balance at the 21-kev level , performed from the @xmath5-capture data @xcite , leads to an experimental electron conversion coefficient @xmath53 , which along with the electron conversion coefficients calculated for a pure @xmath41 or @xmath42 20.56-kev transition @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xcite , respectively , gives a multipole mixing ratio @xmath56 .",
    "the half - life @xmath57(15 ) ns of the first excited state was measured by the @xmath58 delayed coincidences in the @xmath0tc @xmath4-decay @xcite , which leads to a hindered @xmath41 component with @xmath59 w.u . and",
    "possibly enhanced @xmath42 component with @xmath60 w.u .    the 164-kev level in ref .",
    "@xcite , not observed in the present study , decays with @xmath61 ns via a week 55-kev transition to the 108-kev @xmath62 level as well as via a strong 143-kev @xmath63 transition to the 21-kev @xmath64 level . in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath65 was assigned to this level .",
    "hence , the reduced transition probabilities are @xmath66 ( 22 ) w.u . and @xmath67 ( 15 ) w.u .",
    "for the two decay branches , respectively .",
    "the respective @xmath42 component of the 143-kev transition has @xmath68 ( 13 ) w.u .. thus , the two low - lying isomeric states , observed in @xmath0ru prior our study , decay via hindered @xmath41 transitions .",
    "even though the low - lying states in @xmath0ru are extensively studied via different experiments their structure is still not well understood .",
    "thus , from ( d , p ) reactions @xcite , large spectroscopic factors were obtained for the @xmath69 ( 21 kev ) , @xmath70 ( 160 kev ) , @xmath71 ( 209 kev ) , @xmath7 ( 230 kev ) and @xmath72 ( 466 kev ) states in @xmath0ru , shown in the experimental level scheme on fig .",
    "[ 105th ] , suggesting that they contain a large fraction of the single particle strength of the @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 orbitals .",
    "however , @xmath0ru has a high level density at low energies @xcite and the remaining single - particle strength is distributed over a larger number of states . in the shell model approach , some of these states can be interpreted as seniority @xmath78 states @xcite .",
    "such an interpretation was already suggested in @xcite for the ground state , in order to account for the small spectroscopic factor observed in the @xmath40 reaction .",
    "indeed , @xmath79 calculations , shown in fig .  [ 105th ] , with a two - body matrix elements parametrized with respect to the neighboring @xmath2ru , reproduce correctly the @xmath48 ground state .",
    "the @xmath33 member of the multiplet is calculated at 102 kev above the ground state , which is consistent with the 108-kev state in the experimental level scheme and the small spectroscopic factor obtained from the @xmath40 reaction .",
    "also , the empirical shell model calculations predict a @xmath51 level at 795 kev .",
    "given that the @xmath80-forbidden @xmath41 transitions in this mass region are typically hindered by two or three orders of magnitude @xcite , the extra degrees of forbiddenness observed for the @xmath41 transition from the 21-kev , @xmath81 level is consistent with a more complex structure of the ground state , which could involve a @xmath82 configuration .",
    "this scenario could be further tested if we knew the half - life of the 108-kev level , given that the transitions between the same multiplet members are hindered @xcite . by closing this paragraph",
    ", it worth noting that the @xmath83 orbit is also observed at low energy and the occurrence of the respective @xmath84 multiplet members would make the picture even more complicated .",
    "thus , to account for all single - particle orbits a detailed shell - model calculations are needed .",
    "an alternative approach to the problem would be to restrict the valence space as it is realized in the particle - core coupling models . in the weak - coupling model @xcite , discussed in the literature as a possible approach to the @xmath0ru case ,",
    "the excitations of an odd - mass nucleus is considered to be either single - particle or collective excitations of the even - even core . in this model ,",
    "the @xmath41 transitions between the same multiplet members are forbidden while the @xmath42 transitions are enhanced .",
    "this resembles the @xmath0ru case , however , the magnitude of the multiplets splitting in @xmath0ru is of the order of the first phonon energy which makes it difficult to identify the multiplet members",
    ". also , the weak coupling model , which should work better for less deformed nuclei , fails in describing @xmath85ru @xcite suggesting that it might not be suitable for @xmath0ru too .    in the present work",
    ", the particle - core coupling concept will be further tested for @xmath0ru by using the rigid - triaxial - rotor - plus - particle model ( rtrpm ) @xcite .",
    "this model seems to be appropriate for the case of @xmath0ru , given that the nucleus is located in an island of triaxal nuclei .",
    "theoretical calculations for @xmath0ru were performed with the rtrpm in a strong coupling basis @xcite .",
    "the single - particle wave functions were calculated with gampn code , which is part of the asyrmo package @xcite .",
    "a standard set of the nilsson parameters @xcite @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 and @xmath89 was used .",
    "the level energies were calculated with asyrmo @xcite , which diagonalyzes the particle+triaxial rotor hamiltionian .",
    "the quadrupole deformation @xmath90 and the moment - of - inertia @xmath91 parameters were deduced from the neighboring even - even nuclei .",
    "a corriolis attenuation factor @xmath92 was also used to obtain a better description of the band structure .",
    "the pairing was parametrized via @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 . in order to obtain a better fit to the experimental data , @xmath90 , @xmath96 , @xmath1 and @xmath97",
    "parameters were varied .",
    "a good fit to the experimental level energies was obtained with @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 mev .",
    "this set of parameters is consistent with the respective @xmath90 and @xmath1 , obtained from the neighboring even - even nuclei .",
    "a comparison of the experimental and theoretical rtrpm level energies is shown in fig .",
    "[ 105th ] and an example of the variation procedures applied for @xmath0ru is present in fig .",
    "[ rtrpmc ] .    the level energy dependence on @xmath90 is shown in fig .",
    "[ rtrpmc](a ) .",
    "the figure shows also that @xmath48 is the ground state in @xmath0ru only at large deformations , i.e. @xmath102 . also , the relative position of the low - lying states strongly depends on the deformation parameter @xmath90 .",
    "figure [ rtrpmc](b ) shows that @xmath48 is the ground state of @xmath0ru in a wide range of @xmath96 .",
    "this parameter slightly affects also the behavior of the @xmath70 and @xmath8 levels , while its influence on the @xmath72 , @xmath64 and @xmath7 level energies is stronger .",
    "figure  [ rtrpmc](c ) shows that the @xmath0ru level energies strongly depend on the parameter of triaxial deformation @xmath1 for @xmath103 .",
    "this is well pronounced for the @xmath70 and @xmath8 levels and to a lower extent for the @xmath7 , @xmath64 and @xmath104 levels . except for @xmath105 to 26@xmath106",
    ", @xmath48 is the ground state in the entire range of @xmath107 .",
    "figure  [ rtrpmc](d ) shows that the ground state is less sensitive to the moment of inertia parameter and @xmath48 is the ground state for @xmath1080.6 mev .",
    "depending on the effect of the moment - of - inertia parameter on the level energies , two subset of states can be distinguished .",
    "the first group of levels is formed by the @xmath104 and @xmath64 levels , which are almost independent on this parameter .",
    "the second sub - set is formed by the @xmath49 and the @xmath32 states with energies strongly dependent on the moment - of - inertia parameter . @xmath109 and",
    "@xmath110 have a more intermediate trend with respect to the @xmath97 parameter .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ 105th ] , a good overall description of the experimental bands , based on the @xmath32 and @xmath64 excited states , is achieved up to @xmath111 . at higher spins , the experimental bands are more squeezed than the theoretical .",
    "this effect could be explained by the backbending usually observed in the positive parity bands of the odd-@xmath112 , even-@xmath113 nuclei in this mass region .",
    "indeed , the positive - parity sequence , based on the @xmath32 state , closely resembles the yrast band in @xmath2ru , as shown in fig .  [ 105th ] , where backbending is observed .",
    "the energy of the non - yrast @xmath8 and @xmath49 states , experimentally observed close to the ground state , is also well reproduced .",
    "the only major discrepancy between the theory and the experiment at low energies , is in the @xmath72 level energy which is underestimated by the calculations by approximately 200 kev .",
    "this is , somewhat surprising , given this level is expected to be of single - particle nature and hence should be in the model space .",
    "the @xmath41 and @xmath42 transition probabilities were calculated with probamo @xcite . the standard value of @xmath114 for the modification of the free gyromagnetic factor was used .",
    "the magnetic moment of the @xmath48 ground state , obtained from the rtrpm calculations is @xmath115 , which is consistent with the experimental value @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath117 w.u . , calculated for the @xmath118 isomeric transition , is consistent with the experimental value 30.7 w.u . , and shows that the @xmath64 wave function has a collective component .",
    "however , the @xmath119 w.u . , calculated with rtrpm , is highly overestimated given that the experimental @xmath120 w.u . even though , the theoretical @xmath121 is enhanced with respect to the experimental value",
    ", this is still consistent with the experimental data . in the case where the initial state is",
    "a @xmath81 state and the ground state involves a @xmath82 component , which is outside the rtrpm model space , extra degrees of forbiddenness can be expected .",
    "the 55-ns isomer , observed at 164-kev in @xmath0ru @xcite has even a more obscure structure .",
    "this is partially because the existing experimental data does not allow a specific @xmath38 assignment to that level @xcite and also the @xmath122 ns was assigned rather to a @xmath49 level @xcite than to the 164-kev level , assuming the 143-kev transition is a @xmath80-forbidden transition .",
    "indeed , the rtrpm calculations does predict a @xmath48 state at 251 kev , which could be the 164-kev state in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , it decays to the first and the second @xmath33 states via transitions with @xmath123 w.u . and 3.3@xmath124 w.u .",
    ", respectively .",
    "the extra degree of hindrance , observed in the experimental @xmath121 to the @xmath8 state , could be related to the structure of the final state given it is a member of the @xmath82 multiplet .",
    "similarly , the @xmath125 w.u",
    ". decay branch to the ground state , calculated with the rtrpm , is not experimentally observed .",
    "hence , to completely understand the structure of the 164-kev state more experimental data is needed , including unambiguous data for the @xmath38 assignments and a thorough study of its decay branches .",
    "@xmath0ru was produced in induced fission reaction .",
    "its level scheme was extended up to @xmath126 and a new positive - parity band was identified .",

    "the model was parametrized to fit the level energies , known from literature , as well as the data obtained in the present study . in the medium - spin regime ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath127 , the model correctly describes the level energies . at higher spins ,",
    "the experimental level energies are overestimated by the model calculations .",
    "this is not surprising , since the positive - parity bands in the odd - mass , even-@xmath113 nuclei from this mass region exhibit a back - bending due to a @xmath128 pair breaking , which is outside the rtrpm model space .",
