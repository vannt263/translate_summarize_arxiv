    "few years ago , measurements of high energy cosmic - ray ( cr ) electrons above @xmath4 gev were performed mainly by balloon - borne experiments ( kobayashi et al .",
    "2004 and references therein ) .",
    "their measurements showed that the electron spectrum follow a power - law behaviour of the form @xmath5 with the index @xmath6 without any significant features up to energies around @xmath7 tev .",
    "however , recent measurements made by the atic balloon experiment had found a sharp peak at @xmath8gev ( chang et al .",
    "but , this feature was not later detected by two other experiments , the spaced - borne fermi - lat and the ground - based hess experiments ( abdo et al .",
    "2009 , aharonian et al . 2008b , 2009 ) which measured the energy spectrum in the range of @xmath9 .",
    "their combined spectrum can be closely represented by a broken power - law with spectral indices @xmath10 and @xmath11 for energies below and above @xmath2 tev respectively . in standard cr propagation studies assuming a homogeneous source distribution , one way to explain such a spectral behavior is to assume that the electron source spectrum follow a power - law behavior with an exponential cut - off of the form exp@xmath12 with @xmath13tev .",
    "radio and x - ray observations do support such a form of electron spectrum inside supernova remnants ( snrs ) , but with cut - off energies as high as @xmath14 tev as suggested by the study of reynolds @xmath15 keohane 1999 considering magnetic field strengths of @xmath16 g inside the remnants .",
    "however , for young snrs where magnetic field amplification seems to occur , the field strengths can reach values even more than @xmath17 g ( vlk et al . 2005 ) and the maximum energies for the electrons can be strongly limited by radiative losses to values less than @xmath18 tev .",
    "the observed break can also be an effect of inhomogeneous distribution of cr sources contributing to the electrons at higher energies ( atoyan et al .",
    "1995 , kobayashi et al .",
    "2004 , blasi 2009 ) .",
    "this is because high energy electrons can not travel far distances in the galaxy due to their faster radiative cooling .",
    "therefore , it is possible that most of the tev electrons that we measure in the solar system are produced by few young nearby sources",
    ". then , the general assumption of a continuous source distribution may break down and a more reasonable treatment would be to take into account a discrete source distribution . a common method to do this is to use the idea of separation of distant and nearby sources , i.e. , assuming a continuous distribution for the distant sources and considering known snrs or pulsars as the nearby discrete sources .",
    "one of the main uncertainties involved in such studies can be the effect of missing sources due to detection biases . moreover , even for the known sources , the lack of precise informations about the source parameters like the distance , age and the spectral informations can lead to strong uncertainties in the high energy electron spectrum . recently delahaye et al .",
    "2010 presented a detailed study using this method where they included all the known snrs and pulsars located within @xmath7 kpc from the earth and they found that the total high energy spectrum from the nearby sources strongly depends on several source parameters including the assumed cut - off energy .",
    "they also showed that the cut - off energy should be somewhere around a few tev in order to explain the break in the observed data .",
    "an alternative explanation for the break , as will be shown in this paper , is that after acceleration the high energy electrons might have suffered significant losses within the sources itself before they are released into the galaxy .    on the other hand ,",
    "measurements of cr secondary - to - primary ( s / p ) ratios like the boron - to - carbon ( b / c ) up to @xmath19 gev / n by several independent experiments ( see the experiments listed in stephens @xmath15 streitmatter 1998 ) show that above @xmath2 gev / n , the ratio decreases with energy as @xmath20 with the index @xmath21 implying an energy dependent cr propagation path length in the galaxy",
    ". however , these measurements seem to indicate a possible hardening at higher energies ( see also swordy et al . 1990 ) .",
    "recent data from the cream balloon - borne experiment also show flattening at energies around @xmath2 tev / n ( ahn et al . 2008 ) .",
    "one way to explain this is to assume that crs traverse some minimum amount of matter of approximately @xmath22 g @xmath23 in the galaxy ( ave et al .",
    "this implies an energy dependent escape path length of crs up to some certain energy and beyond that energy , the path length becomes constant in energy .",
    "this view is , in fact , supported by the observed cr anisotropy which remain almost constant above around @xmath3 gev energies .",
    "but such model need to assume a break in the source spectrum in order to explain the observed cr spectrum which closely follow a pure power - law without any break up to the knee .",
    "another possible explanation is that some amount of secondaries might be produced inside the sources due to the nuclear interaction of the primaries with the matter ( berezhko et al .",
    "2003 ) . under such models ,",
    "the cr anisotropy is expected to increase with energy as @xmath24 which does not agree well with the observed data .",
    "however , it is quite possible that at higher energies the anisotropy might not be determined by the global diffusion leakage of crs from the galaxy .",
    "rather , it might be the effects of high energy crs coming from nearby sources because of their faster diffusion in the galaxy ( ptuskin et al .",
    "2005 , thoudam 2007 ) .",
    "one more possible explanation which we will not discuss here is the possible reacceleration of some fraction of the background crs by strong snr shocks while propagating in the galaxy ( wandel et al .",
    "1987 , berezhko et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present one possible explanation for the observed break in the electron spectrum at around @xmath2 tev and its possible correlation with the flattening in the b / c ratio at energies above around @xmath3 gev / n . in our model",
    ", we assume that crs are accelerated by snr shock waves by diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) mechanism ( bell 1978 , blandford @xmath15 eichler 1987 ) . under dsa theory , suprathermal particles in the tail of the maxwell - boltzmann distribution present in the interstellar medium ( ism )",
    "are injected into the supernova shock front .",
    "they are then reflected back and forth several times across the shock by the magnetic turbulence generated on either side of the shock and in each crossing , the particles gain energy by first order fermi acceleration . in a simple planar shocks model",
    ", such a mechanism naturally leads to a power - law spectrum of the form @xmath5 with @xmath25 for strong shocks which is in good agreement with radio observations of several snrs ( green 2009 ) .",
    "one important consideration of the standard dsa theory is that most of the particles do not escape upstream of the shock , they can only escape downstream mainly due to advection by the bulk flow and remain confined within the remnant due to the strong magnetic turbulence generated by the crs themselves . though it is still not fully understood , it is generally considered that the particles remain inside the remnant until the shock remains strong . during the confinement period , the high energy electrons may suffer from radiative energy losses while the nuclear components suffer from nuclear fragmentations . at later stages",
    "when the shock slows down and does not efficiently accelerate the crs , the magnetic turbulence level goes down and the particles can no longer be confined effectively within the remnant . at such stage , all the particles present inside the remnant escape and they are injected into the ism . for a typical ism density of @xmath2 h @xmath26 , this happens at around @xmath27 yr after the supernova explosion ( berezhko @xmath15 vlk 2000 ) .",
    "the scenario described above might be true mostly for the lower energy particles because it is quite possible that some of the highest energy particles may escape the remnant already at the start of the sedov phase itself due to their faster diffusion .",
    "such an energy dependent escape of particles has been discussed in a number of literatures ( ptuskin @xmath15 zirakashvili 2005 , gabici , aharonian @xmath15 casanova 2009 ) .",
    "recent high energy @xmath28-ray observations of snrs associated with molecular clouds also suggest that some of the high energy particles might have already escaped the remnant at much early times ( aharonian et al .",
    "2007 , aharonian et al .",
    "but , as mentioned above , it is still not clear how and when exactly the particles escape the remnant .",
    "for simplicity , we consider an energy independent scenario for our present work and assume that all the particles are released into the ism at some characteristic time after the supernova explosion .",
    "once the crs are released into the ism , we assume that they undergo diffusive propagation in the galaxy where the electrons again suffer from radiative losses and the nuclei from nuclear spallation with the interstellar matter .",
    "therefore , in our model the cr spectra that we finally observe in the solar system are modified from their original source spectrum ( the one generated by the snr shocks ) due to the various interactions or energy loss processes occurring not only during their propagation in the galaxy , but also within the snrs itself .",
    "our paper is planned as follows . in section 2 , we present our calculations for the cr spectra inside the snrs and in section 3 , we calculate the spectra in the galaxy .",
    "then , in section 4 , we compare our results with the observed data and also give a short discussions about our results .",
    "finally in section 5 , we give a brief conclusion of our study .",
    "we assume that cr acceleration by snr shock waves begins at the time of the supernova explosion itself and the crs then escape downstream of the shock and remain confined within the remnant .",
    "we further assume that at some later stage of the snr evolution characterize by age @xmath29 when the shock slows down , particle acceleration stops and also all the crs present inside the remnant are released into the ism . in our study , we do not consider the expansion of the remnant and hence neglect the effect of adiabatic energy losses and other related effects .",
    "detailed study including the evolution of the remnant , the weakening of the shock with time and the possible energy dependent escape of crs will be presented elsewhere .      under the assumption that the acceleration time of crs is much less than their confinement time within the snr",
    ", the cr electron spectrum inside an snr can be described by the following equation , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the total number of electrons of kinetic energy @xmath32 present within the snr at time @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the energy loss rate and @xmath35 is the source term which , in our case , is the rate at which cr electrons are injected downstream of the shock .",
    "we believe that eq .",
    "( 1 ) represents a valid approximation at least for energies up to around @xmath4 tev for which the typical acceleration timescale is less than @xmath36 yr ( sturner et al . 1997 ) . in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we consider the energy loss of the electrons to be due to synchrotron and inverse compton interactions which is true for energies @xmath37 gev .",
    "therefore , we take in the thompson regime @xmath38 with @xmath39 gev@xmath40 s@xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the energy densities of the radiation fields and the magnetic field respectively in ev @xmath26 . with this , we define the radiative energy loss timescale for the electrons as @xmath43 .",
    "now , for the source spectrum taken as power - law of the form , @xmath44 the solution of eq .",
    "( 1 ) at time @xmath33 can be written as ( kardashev 1962 , gratton 1972 ) @xmath45 , \\ ;",

    "( 4 ) shows that for energies @xmath48 , the electron spectrum still reflects the source spectrum because of their large @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath49 .",
    "however , for electrons with energies @xmath50 , their spectrum is quite steeper due to their faster energy loss rate and follows @xmath51 .      for the cr primary nuclei",

    "( 6 ) becomes @xmath60 .    during the time when primary crs are confined within the snrs",
    ", they interact with matter and produce secondary nuclei of almost the same kinetic energy per nucleon as their primaries .",
    "these secondaries can also be described by an equation similar to eq .",
    "( 5 ) by replacing the source term by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the total fragmentation crossection of primary to secondary .",
    "the solution for these secondaries is then obtained by @xmath63\\ ] ] where , @xmath64 in eq .",

    "crs after escaping from the snrs undergo diffusive propagation in the galaxy due to scattering either by magnetic field irregularities or by self excited alfven and hydromagnetic waves . for the present work",
    ", we assume the diffusion region as a cylindrical disk of infinite radius with finite half - thickness @xmath66 and that the sources as well as the matter are distributed uniformly and continuously in the galactic disk with half - thickness @xmath67 and radius @xmath68 , where @xmath69 .",
    "the details of the geometry are described in thoudam 2008 . during the propagation ,",
    "high energy electrons interact with the background radiation and the magnetic fields and lose their energies . on the other hand ,",
    "cr nuclei undergo nuclear spallation interactions with the interstellar matter and produce lighter nuclear species .",
    "as already mentioned in section 1 , the assumption of a continuous source distribution may not be fully appropriate for high energy electrons particularly those in the tev region because of their faster energy loss rate .",
    "electrons with energies greater than @xmath2 tev can not travel distances more than @xmath70 kpc in the galaxy through diffusive propagation before they lost all their energies .",
    "therefore , high energy electrons from distant and old sources may not reach the earth effectively and tev electrons that we observe can be mostly dominated by those produced by few young local sources .",
    "the effect of this can be that the spectrum at high energies can be quite complex because of its strong dependence on the local source parameters ( delahaye et al .",
    "moreover , it may even show up features related to the stochastic nature of the local sources in space and time ( see e.g. , pohl @xmath15 esposito 1998 ) .    in our study ,",
    "our main focus is to explore the possibility of explaining the break in the electron spectrum as an effect of cr confinement in the downstream region of snrs and at the same time , following the standard model of cr propagation in the galaxy .",
    "such an effect of confinement within the sources are generally not considered in cr propagation studies and we believe that they may exist if snrs are the main sources of galactic crs . therefore , we do not intend to focus on a detailed source distribution and in what follows , we adopt the continuous and stationary source distribution for calculating the cr spectrum in the galaxy .      under the diffusion model",
    ", the propagation of high energy electrons in the galaxy can be described by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the electron number density in the galaxy , @xmath73 is the diffusion coefficient which is assumed to be constant through out the galaxy and @xmath74 is the source term given by @xmath75 . here , @xmath76 is given by eq .",

    "our model , in its present form , looks similar to the the nested leaky box model proposed by cowsik @xmath15 wilson 1973 , 1975 .",
    "however , there are major differences in the basic assumptions between the two models . they assumed that crs after acceleration spend some time in a cocoon - like region surrounding the sources where the primaries interact with the matter and produce secondaries .",
    "the residence time of crs inside the cocoon was assumed to be energy _",
    "dependent _ and after they are released from the source region , they undergo an energy _",
    "independent _ propagation in the galaxy . in their model ,",
    "secondary production inside the cocoon dominates at lower energies and at higher energies , it is dominated by the production in the ism . on the other hand , the basic idea of our model comes from our understanding of dsa theory inside snrs . in our model ,",
    "the cr confinement region as well as the confinement time are strongly related to the acceleration mechanism itself . moreover",
    ", secondary production inside the remnant dominates only at higher energies while at lower energies , they are dominated mostly by those produced in the galaxy .",
    "a more proper treatment of our model would be to perform a self consistent calculation of primary cr acceleration and their confinement , both of which are strongly related to the efficiency of cr scattering around the shocks by magnetic turbulence .",
    "also , we should include the secondaries produced during the acceleration process along with those produced during the confinement period and if there , also their acceleration by the same shock waves which accelerate their primaries .",
    "such a scenario of secondary acceleration has been considered to explain the rise in the positron fraction reported by the pamela experiment ( blasi 2009 ) . though it is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss this issue , it is worthwhile to mention in relation to our present model , that the relative contribution of the accelerated and the non - accelerated secondaries to their total spectrum strongly depends on the relative time their primaries spend in the acceleration region and in the downstream region ( see e.g. kachelriess et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "we emphasize that under our present model , both the high energy electron spectrum and the s / p ratio depend strongly on the cr confinement time inside the snrs .",
    "therefore , their data can be used to put constraints on the average confinement time provided that detailed informations about the magnetic field strengths and the matter densities inside the remnants are taken into account .",
    "note that the value of the magnetic field strength of @xmath179 g and also that of the matter density @xmath180 @xmath26 adopted in our present work can be different from those expected in snrs .",
    "for snrs expanding in an environment consisting of monoatomic ideal gas , their values are expected to be equal to the ism values scaled by some constant factor which in the case of strong shocks is approximately equal to @xmath181 .",
    "moreover , these values can also be different for different snrs and their true values can only be inferred from observations of radio or x - ray synchrotron emissions and thermal x - rays from snrs ( bamba et al .",
    "2003 , uchiyama et al .",
    "2007 ) . in future",
    ", we will include such details in our calculation and also try to extend our work to other secondary species like the cr anti - protons and the positrons .",
    "in addition , we will also include some important aspects which we have neglected in our present study like the evolution of the remnant , the weakening of the shocks and the energy dependent escape of crs from the snrs .",
    "adding such aspects , particularly the energy dependent escape , can strongly affect our results .",
    "for instance , assuming an escape model which follows the same energy dependence as in the galaxy can lead to disappearance of the flattening in the s / p ratio at higher energies .",

    "st would also like to thank d. mller for carefully reading the first draft of this manuscript and for giving valuable suggestions .",
