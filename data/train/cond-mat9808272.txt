    "absorbing type dynamic phase transitions are the focus of extensive research  @xcite .",
    "these transitions occur in dynamic processes with trapped states . at the absorbing side of the phase transition",
    ", the system evolves into one specific microscopic state , a so - called absorbing state , out of which it can not escape . at the active side of the phase transition , the system manages to avoid such traps .",
    "an ensemble has a finite probability to stay alive .",
    "two distinct types of absorbing phase transitions have been identified in one dimension : the directed percolation  ( dp ) and directed ising  ( di ) universality class .",
    "dp type dynamic critical behavior has been found in , e.g. ,  schlgl s first model for contact processes  @xcite , pair contact processes  @xcite , and branching annihilating random walks  ( baw ) with an odd - number of offspring  @xcite .",
    "di type dynamic critical behavior has been found in , e.g. ,  probabilistic cellular automata  @xcite , nonequilibrium kinetic ising type models  @xcite , interacting monomer - dimer models  @xcite , and baw models with an even - number of offspring  @xcite .",
    "these models describe a wide range of phenomena , in particular epidemic spreading and catalytic chemical reactions .    in analogy with equilibrium phase transitions",
    ", it is believed that dynamic universality classes are determined by the degeneracy and symmetries of the absorbing states and by the symmetry properties of interfaces ( domain walls ) between them  @xcite .",
    "dp type transitions involve typically only a single absorbing state or a set of absorbing states with one of them dynamically more prominent in a coarse grained sense than the others  @xcite .",
    "di type transitions involve two equivalent adsorbing states or two equivalent classes of absorbing states  @xcite .",
    "counting the number of absorbing states is not sufficient .",
    "the degeneracy of the absorbing states can be obscured by the formulation of the dynamic rule .",
    "for example , in baw dynamics involving only one species of particles , the  empty \" absorbing state seems not to be degenerate , but the transition belongs to the di universality class if the dynamics conserves the particle number modulo 2  @xcite . in that case particles can be reinterpreted as domain walls and we can color the domains at opposite sides of the walls alternatingly with two colors .",
    "one of the two colors dies out in the adsorbing state .",
    "this is reminiscent of the domain wall formulation of the equilibrium ising model , where the existence of two coexisting phases is also obscured .",
    "one appealing scheme of classifying absorbing phase transitions is by association with conventional equilibrium phase transitions .",
    "for example , consider the one - dimensional ising model with single spin - flip dynamics . in terms of domain walls",
    "this involves the following processes : spontaneous creation of domain wall pairs @xmath0 with probability @xmath1 ( the boltzmann weight ) , hopping of single domain walls with probability @xmath2 , and pair annihilation @xmath3 with probability @xmath4 .",
    "the stationary state of this model is the equilibrium state , which is obviously  disordered \" ( active ) in one dimension .",
    "however , the model evolves always into one of the two perfectly ordered ( absorbing ) states if we disallow the spontaneous creation of domain walls , @xmath5 , because then the domain wall density can only decrease .",
    "the di transition comes into play when branching processes are allowed ; i.e. , the creation of domain wall pairs in the vicinity of existing domain walls , @xmath6 . branching can keep the system alive , while the two perfectly ordered ising ground states still remain absorbing states .",
    "the resulting model is known as the baw model with two offspring .    the same line of reasoning associates a distinct absorbing type dynamic universality class with each conventional equilibrium universality class , like the familiar @xmath7-state potts and @xmath7-state clock universality classes .",
    "however , none of the models studied thus far with higher symmetries than the ising model has an absorbing phase transition .",
    "dynamic processes with more than 2 equivalent absorbing states @xmath8 appear to be always active  @xcite .",
    "cardy and tuber provide a possible explanation for this @xcite .",
    "additional systematic numerical studies are needed to settle this issue .",
    "in this paper we introduce an application of absorbing phase transitions to the dynamics of one - dimensional solid - gas interfaces . we find a one - dimensional dynamic preroughening ( pr ) transition from an ordered flat ( absorbing ) phase to a disordered flat ( active ) phase .",
    "consider the one - dimensional restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) model description of crystal surfaces .",
    "the height difference between nearest neighboring columns of particles is 0 or @xmath9 , i.e. ,  only steps ( kinks ) with single atomic heights are allowed .",
    "a conventional dynamic monte carlo type equilibration process where single particles adsorb on or desorb from the surface with equal probability leads to a rough equilibrium surface with edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) type  @xcite scaling properties .",
    "in analogy with the above directed ising model discussion , we transform the perfectly ordered flat state into an absorbing state by disallowing adsorption and desorption of particles at flat segments of the surface ( spontaneous creation of step pairs ) .",
    "the only processes allowed are : hopping / pair annihilation of steps by adsorbing or desorbing a particle at step edges and branching of steps by adsorption or desorption at the next nearest neighbour sites near existing steps .",
    "the branching processes fall into two classes : the ones that preserve local flatness and those that create local roughness .",
    "we give them independent probabilities .",
    "this model describes the evolution of the one dimensional interface from any initial random rough configuration to three types of stationary states : a rough phase with dynamic exponent @xmath10 ( ew type ) , a perfectly ordered flat ( of ) absorbing phase without steps , and an active disordered flat ( dof ) phase .",
    "dof phases are well known in equilibrium surfaces .",
    "they represent step liquids where the surface remains flat due to long - range step - up step - down alternating order but steps are placed randomly  @xcite .",
    "our dynamic dof stationary state has no defects , i.e. , the up - down alternating order is perfect and the the steps are placed randomly .",
    "although the dynamic dof phase is active , it has an absorbing state type property .",
    "the of absorbing state and the dof active phase at the other side of the transition have in common that both  ground states \" lack thermodynamic defects ( both are at their fixed point in the sense of renormalization theory ) .",
    "equilibrium preroughening transitions belong to the ashkin - teller universality class  @xcite .",
    "they involve two coupled ising type order parameters .",
    "they are non - zero at opposite sides of the transition .",
    "a perfectly dof initial configuration has a half integer average surface height @xmath11 and evolves at the of side of the pr transition into a perfectly flat ordered absorbing state with @xmath12 or @xmath13 integer surface height .",
    "this of - type two - fold degeneracy is the conventional spontaneous symmetry breaking associated with di type transitions .",
    "however , an ising type degeneracy exists also at the dof side of the pr transition .",
    "an initial state with an integer average surface height @xmath12 , evolves into a stationary dof state with surface height @xmath11 or @xmath14 .",
    "we call this the dof - type degeneracy",
    ". in analogy with equilibrium transitions one might expect therefore that the dynamic pr transition be described by 2 coupled di transitions .",
    "this turns out not to be the case .",
    "the dynamic pr transition belongs to the ( single ) di universality class .",
    "the two types of spontaneous symmetry breaking are not on an equal footing .",
    "a perfect dof initial state can decay into the of state , but a perfect of state is frozen forever ( even at the dof side of the pr transition ) .",
    "the dof type degeneracy does not create additional di critical fluctuations .",
    "but it still affects the scaling behaviour .",
    "configurations with perfect dof order form an invariant subspace ( which includes the of ordered state ) .",
    "as shown below , this leads to a peculiar initial configuration dependence of the asymptotic decay of the step densities ( the kinks in the one - dimensional interface ) .    in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce our model in detail .",
    "it is instructive to interpret it not only as a model for surface relaxation , but also for surface catalysis . in its latter reincarnation ,",
    "the process is a two - species generalization of the baw model with two offspring .",
    "the up and down steps ( kinks ) represent two species of particles , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    in section 3",
    "we limit ourselves to configurations with perfect @xmath17 alternating order .",
    "these dof type configurations form a dynamical invariant subspace .",
    "the numerical results presented in section 3 confirm that our pr transition belongs to the di universality class .    in section 4",
    ", we discuss the crossover scaling properties of the di critical point into the rough phase .",
    "the rough phase has conventional ew type scaling properties .",
    "recall that we disallow spontaneous adsorption and desorption from flat surface segments ; surface roughness can only be created and maintained by branching . apparently , this restriction does not alter the scaling properties of the rough phase .",
    "the dof - type ising degeneracy shows up in the evolution of arbitrary initial states . the kink densities scale in time in an unusual way , not only at the pr transition , but also everywhere in the of and dof phases .",
    "they depend strongly on the initial conditions ; whether the initial configuration is flat or rough , and on the correlations in such initial rough states .",
    "conventional wisdom tells us that the long time scaling of dynamic processes depends only on the dynamic exponent and the stationary state exponents of a process . in our case ,",
    "critical exponents vary with the initial conditions .",
    "we present an analytical scaling theory for this in section 5 and numerical results in section 6 .",
    "consider a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "each site is vacant or occupied by at most one @xmath15 or one @xmath16 type particle . in the surface catalysis interpretation ,",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 represent two types of particles . in the surface formulation , they represent up and down steps .",
    "configurations evolve in time according to the following dynamic rule .",
    "first choose a site at random .",
    "if the site is empty , nothing happens .",
    "if the site is occupied , the particle can hop to its nearest - neighbor sites with probability @xmath18 .",
    "if it lands on top of an existing particle of the opposite kind , the @xmath19 pair annihilates immediately . the move is rejected if the particle would land on top of a particle of the same type .",
    "besides hopping , each particle can also branch into three particles by the creation of an @xmath19 pair .",
    "branching comes in two distinct flavours ; the one that preserves local @xmath17 order and the one that breaks it .",
    "order preserving branching ( opb ) creates local dof step - up step - down order in the surface .",
    "order breaking branching ( obb ) creates local roughness ( see fig .",
    "[ rule ] ) .",
    "these branching processes occur with probability @xmath7 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "branching could lead into double occupancy of a site .",
    "@xmath19 pairs at the same site annihilate immediately .",
    "the branching event is rejected if it would result in two particles of the same type at any site .",
    "we require that the chosen particle must attempt to hop or branch .",
    "this implies that @xmath21 . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are our choices for independent parameters .    we need to distinguish also between so - called dynamic and static branching .",
    "the two new particles , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , created by each branching process may be placed in two different ways .",
    "the center of mass is stationary ( static branching ) or moves ( dynamic branching )  @xcite . in the latter",
    "the new particles are placed both to the left or both to the right of the parent particle with equal probability . in the interface representation of the model , dynamic",
    "branching corresponds to single particle adsorption / desorption .",
    "static branching represents two - particle events ( see fig .",
    "[ rule ] ) .",
    "so dynamic branching is more natural .",
    "these details do not affect the universality of the phase transition .",
    "but they can change dramatically the location of the critical point@xcite .",
    "it is well known that in the baw model with two offspring the stationary state is always absorbing .",
    "static branching does not create enough activity to destabilize the absorbing phase  .",
    "we applied both type of branching in our simulations .",
    "the universal scaling properties do not change . here only our results for dynamic branching are presented .    each particle configuration of the surface catalysis model maps onto a surface height configuration of the rsos type surface growth model .",
    "the @xmath15 and @xmath16 particles represent up and down steps of unit height .",
    "the above dynamic rules for the @xmath15 and @xmath16 type particles translate into placement or removal of a single surface atom near existing steps ( fig .",
    "[ rule ] ) .",
    "adsorptions and desorptions have equal probability",
    ". the surface does not advance nor retreat on average .",
    "flat segments of the surface are inactive , which makes the perfectly ordered flat state an absorbing state .    the structure of the phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] .",
    "the numerical details will be presented in section 3 and 4 . here",
    "we want to point out the general features .",
    "opb type branching preserves the average surface height , while obb type branching creates local roughness .",
    "this suggests two distinct types of active phases . in the region of the phase diagram where opb type branching is dominant , the steps prefer up - down alternating order . the surface likes to remain flat on average with randomly placed steps .",
    "this is a one - dimensional dynamical version of the dof phase known from two - dimensional equilibrium crystal surfaces  @xcite . in the region of the phase diagram where obb type branching is dominant",
    ", the active phase lacks step up - down alternating order and is therefore probably rough .    in the presence of obb",
    "type branching ( @xmath24 ) , the stationary surface state turns out to be always rough ( see fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] ) . along the @xmath25 line ,",
    "the surface is flat ; in the of absorbing phase for @xmath26 and the dof active phase for @xmath27 .",
    "spontaneous order is difficult to maintain in one dimension .",
    "this explains why the dof phase is limited to the @xmath25 subspace .",
    "it would have been nice , but a surprise if the of phase extended into @xmath28 .",
    "equilibrium roughening phase transitions can be viewed as @xmath29 limits of the @xmath7-state clock model .",
    "absorbing phase transitions with @xmath30 are unknown and may not exist at all as mentioned in section 1  @xcite .",
    "the transition point @xmath31 in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] represents a one - dimensional dynamic analogue of equilibrium preroughening transitions .",
    "the disordered flat phase is active ( a step liquid phase ) , but maintains perfect step - up step - down alternating order . @xmath15 and @xmath16 type particles move around like in a liquid , but remain perfectly @xmath17 ordered .",
    "the distances between neighboring @xmath15 and @xmath16 particles are randomly distributed .    to determine the scaling properties of this transition ( section 3 ) we measure the step ( particle ) density @xmath32 as a function of time @xmath33 , which is the sum of the two single particle densities , @xmath34 .",
    "the difference between them , @xmath35 , describes the global tilt of the surface and is preserved by the dynamic rule .",
    "the step density @xmath36 in the stationary state vanishes in the absorbing phase and remains non - zero in the two active ( rough and dof ) phases .",
    "we monitor also the density of @xmath19 pairs of particles , @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath15 and @xmath16 particles in each @xmath19 pair do not have to be immediately adjacent to each other .",
    "they can be separated by a stretch of empty space of arbitrary length .",

    "in this section we present numerical evidence for the di nature of the dynamic preroughening transition .",

    ", each site may be empty or occupied by a particle of a single species .",
    "those particles can hop to a nearest neighbor site with probability @xmath18 or create two offspring on the nearest and next - nearest neighbor sites to the left or to the right with probability @xmath51 ( dynamic branching ) .",
    "two particles annihilate immediately when they happen to land on the same site .",
    "this baw model exhibits an absorbing phase transition at @xmath52 , which belongs to the di universality class  @xcite .",
    "there is an exact two - on - one mapping between the configurations in our model and those in the above baw model .",
    "simply label the particles in the latter as @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( or @xmath16 and @xmath15 ) alternatingly .",
    "the dynamic processes for the two models are virtually the same , except for one detail . in the baw model , without @xmath15 and @xmath16 labels , particles can always annihilate when they land on the same site . in our model",
    "only @xmath15 and @xmath16 pairs can annihilate , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 pairs repel each other .",
    "hopping events are not affected by this , but opb type branching processes are .",
    "consider a configuration with an isolated @xmath19 nearest pair , like @xmath53 where @xmath54 represents a vacant site .",
    "suppose that the @xmath15 particle is chosen to branch a pair of @xmath55 particles to the right . in our model , this attempt is rejected because it would result in two @xmath16 particles on a single site . in the the baw model this attempt is accepted , and results in the annihilation of two particles .",
    "this difference between the two models does not affect the mod 2 conservation of the total particle number .",
    "so we expect a di - type absorbing phase transition along the @xmath25 line , but the of phase must be more stable .",
    "the mapping between configurations of the baw model and our model is lost outside the configurational subspace with perfect @xmath17 order .",
    "the dof subspace is an attractor , however .",
    "it contains the global stationary state for arbitrary initial configurations .",
    "consider an arbitrary configuration , i.e. , one with @xmath40 and @xmath41 pairs .",
    "for @xmath56 there is no mechanism to increase their total numbers , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . hopping and opb type branching decrease @xmath57 and @xmath58 , by annihilation of @xmath19 pairs but",
    "never increase them .",

    "<S> we present a realization of directed ising ( di ) type dynamic absorbing state phase transitions in the context of one - dimensional interfaces , such as the relaxation of a step on a vicinal surface . under the restriction that particle deposition and evaporation can only take place near existing kinks </S>",
    "<S> , the interface relaxes into one of three steady states : rough , perfectly ordered flat ( of ) without kinks , or disordered flat ( dof ) with randomly placed kinks but in perfect up - down alternating order . </S>",
    "<S> a di type dynamic preroughening transition takes place between the of and dof phases . at this critical point </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic time evolution is controlled not only by the di exponents but also by the initial condition . </S>",
