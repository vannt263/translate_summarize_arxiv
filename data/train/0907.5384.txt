    "the model systematically underestimates the amplitude of the @xmath99 oscillations , with the largest discrepancy occurring when the energy sweep causes a compression of the spectrum .",
    "this has to be expected as the quantum interference between different processes that bring the excited electron to a given final state becomes most important in this case .",
    "the broadening of the spectra is reproduced much better ; in particular , the time point at which the spectral width is maximal is predicted rather accurately .",
    "the numerical experiments , thus , suggest that the limitations of the ssa lie in treating the interaction with the laser field , i.e. , in eq .",

    "( [ newmod ] ) is quite reasonable .    in view of the complicated interplay between different broadening mechanisms and",
    "because the pulse width @xmath115 is a non - linear function of both @xmath20 and @xmath67 the question arises whether a chirped pulse can be characterized by extracting only the gross parameter @xmath99 from the streaking measurements .",
    "a more general but complicated procedure is to measure a complete spectrogram @xmath123 and decipher it with a frog algorithm ( frequency - resolved optical gating ) , which under certain conditions allows to reconstruct both the intensity profile and the phase of the pulse  @xcite .",

    "this simple relation tells us that the laser free photoelectron spectrum is determined by the spectrum of the exciting pulse but does not depend upon its temporal structure . in the streaking measurements it is just the temporal structure which is probed , and we have shown that the resulting spectrum depends on the intensity envelope , while the phase structure of the pump pulse is blurred . in the case of a fourier limited pulse",
    "it enters only indirectly , as the relation between the temporal and the spectral extent of the pulse . in the case of a chirped pulse",
    "it is insufficient to know the time envelope and the spectrum .",
    "we have shown that this more complicated temporal structure can to a good approximation be treated in spirit of the formal instantaneous frequency by introducing an instantaneous spectral distribution and again neglecting the actual phase relations .",
    "we have applied these considerations to calculating streaked spectra within the semiclassical superposition approximation .",
    "although the concept of initial time - momentum distribution @xmath0 lacks a rigorous physical meaning a function with the required properties can be constructed , which is capable of describing the lineshapes of streaked spectra for chirped pump pulses .",
    "in addition to the temporal structure of the pulse it takes into account its spectral extent , i.e. , the fact that during the action of the pulse electrons are created in all states but with different rate .",
    "both the temporal and the spectral factors are important for the shape of the streaked edc , and the photon energy sweep , which both complicates the temporal structure and broadens the spectrum , provides a severe test of the ssa model .",
    "the model yields quantitatively correct results for a wide range of parameters and provides a useful basis for the understanding of the role of pulse parameters and properties of the electronic system . the latter are included through the energy dependent photoemission cross - section , which was found to strongly affect the lineshapes .",
    "the property of the model to decouple the semiclassical calculation of the time evolution of the system from the quantum - mechanical calculation of the dipole matrix elements makes it attractive for use for more complicated many - body systems , for which a consistent quantum - mechanical calculation is currently computationally infeasible : one can reasonably suppose that the present formalism would remain valid with a more advanced description of the excitation , see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "the main limitations of the model naturally come from its neglect of the quantum interference that accompanies the acceleration of the wave packet by the laser field . in the case",
    "considered this led to underestimated broadening and compression for sufficiently large pulse durations and chirp rates , but did not affect the qualitative picture .",
    "the phenomenological function @xmath1 suggested in this paper differs from the time - momentum distribution @xmath129 in the absence of the laser field in the two essential features : it discards the retardation of the final state population with respect to the pulse intensity profile and avoids negative values of the population rate .",
    "thereby the function @xmath1 provides the most direct connection between the input pulse and the output edc , and , moreover , the two aspects are found instrumental in reproducing the shape of the streaked edcs within the ssa .",
    "this means , however , that in solving the inverse problem , i.e. , obtaining information about the pump process from streaking measurements some essential features of the process may be lost .",
    "we have shown that in the simplest case of a linear chirp the relation between the input pulse and output spectrum can be presented on a map that establishes a one to one correspondence between gross features of the input and the output .",
    "this means that provided a reliable theory of photoemission is available and the experimental resolution is high the pump pulse can be characterized by a few streak records .",
