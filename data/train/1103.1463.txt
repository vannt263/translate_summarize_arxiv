    "in 1965 hagedorn  @xcite proposed that the number of hadronic resonances increases exponentially with the mass @xmath2 of the resonances .",
    "the idea , which was debated strongly when first proposed , has since been widely accepted and discussed by many authors  @xcite . the concept was based on the assumption that the observed increase in the number of hadronic resonances would continue towards higher and higher masses as more experimental data became available  @xcite .",
    "the scale of the exponential increase determines the value of the hagedorn temperature , @xmath0 .",
    "recent papers  @xcite have used the latest results from the particle data group  @xcite to revisit the original analysis of hagedorn to update the value of @xmath0 .",
    "this resulted in a surprising wide spread of possible values , with large variations as to whether one considers mesons or baryons with values ranging from @xmath3 mev to @xmath4 mev depending on the parametrization used and on the set of hadrons ( mesons or baryons ) .",
    "there thus exists uncertainty as to the value of the hagedorn temperature .",
    "these have two origins :    * sparse information about hadronic resonances certainly above 3 gev , * the analytical form of the hagedorn spectrum , especially the factor multiplying the exponential .",
    "the first item will probably never be resolved satisfactorily due to the width of resonances and also due to their large number making it difficult to identify them . splitting the spectrum into baryons and mesons further decreases the quality of the fits to the mass dependence of the mass spectrum .",
    "we therefore propose to stick to the original analysis of hagedorn and consider a sum over all resonances , baryons , mesons , strange , non - strange , charm , bottom etc .. this is the state that is produced at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , namely , a hadronic ensemble containing all possible resonances . the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ nocutoff ] and leads to a good determination of @xmath0 because the range in @xmath2 is reasonably large extending up to 3 gev before reaching a plateau presumably due to the parsity of hadronic resonances above this value .",
    "details about the parametrization used will be presented below .",
    "+    . again",
    "the hadronic data are made up of all resonances , including baryons , mesons and also heavy resonances made up of charm and bottom quarks.,title=\"fig:\",width=529,height=377 ] [ nocutoff ]    the hagedorn temperature naturally leads to the notion that hadronic matter can not exceed a limiting temperature and increasing the beam energy in proton@xmath5proton and proton@xmath5antiproton collisions results in more and more hadronic resonances being produced without a corresponding increase in the temperature of the final ( freeze - out ) state .",
    "this is the situation observed at the highest energies at the lhc .",
    "it was suggested long ago  @xcite that the hagedorn temperature is connected to the existence of a different phase in which quarks and gluons are no longer confined . at present , the hagedorn temperature is often understood as the temperature of the phase transition from hadrons to a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "+ a recent analysis  @xcite investigated the hadron resonance gas model  @xcite to show the stability of various thermodynamic quantities in heavy - ion collisions when the hagedorn spectrum is used literally , i.e. without a cut - off on the number of resonances beyond a certain mass . in particular , the authors explored the addition of the hadron resonance gas model including an exponentially large number of undiscovered resonances which are naturally included in the hagedorn model .",
    "their results showed that the hadron resonance gas model gave different results for thermodynamic quantities but the overall chemical analysis was reasonably stable .",
    "furthermore , the use of so - called hagedorn states ( hs ) , based on the exponentially increasing spectrum , close to the critical temperature can explain fast chemical equilibration by hs regeneration  @xcite and provide a unique method to compare lattice results for @xmath6 using thermal fits hs provide a lower @xmath7 than thermal fits without hs @xcite .",
    "these authors estimated effects by extending the hadron mass spectrum beyond @xmath8 gev for @xmath0 = 200 mev and assume that high mass excited @xmath9 states produce one kaon while producing multiple pions thus further reducing the @xmath10 @xcite .    in this paper , we extend previous work  @xcite by extending explicit expressions of relevant thermodynamic quantities for non - zero chemical potentials",
    ". in particular the speed of sound , @xmath11 , can be considered as a sensitive indicator of the critical behavior in strongly interacting matter .",
    "the results show a sharp dip of @xmath11 in the critical region , which is an indication that thermodynamics in the vicinity of confinement is indeed driven by the higher excited hadronic states .",
    "+ the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present the influence of the hagedorn spectrum on the hadron yields to find the thermodynamic parameters and explain the basic concepts used in this paper . in section 3",
    ", we derive the number , energy and entropy densities and also the speed of sound . in section 4",
    ", we show the results using the hadron and its extension resonance gas model for particular thermodynamic quantities and discuss the relationship of @xmath11 with temperature and chemical potentials and compare thermodynamic quantities , like energy and entropy density .",
    "the last section covers the conclusion .",
    "the particle data table contains hundreds of hadronic resonances  @xcite including the well known stable hadrons like nucleons , pions , hyperons ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , kaons etc .. in our calculations we used a list of hadronic resonances including in total @xmath15 baryons and antibaryons , @xmath16 mesons and antimesons ( counted without considering their isospin and spin degeneracies ) .",
    "most of the hadronic resonances decay quickly via strong interactions before reaching the detector , hence they are usually identified via their decay products .",
    "the mass of a decaying particle is equal to the total energy of the products measured in its rest frame .",
    "+ the basic idea of this paper is to add resonances using the hagedorn model for the spectrum . using the hadronic data we show the relationship between the number of hadronic resonances and the mass in fig .",

    "it is well - known  @xcite that the speed of sound has to be calculated at constant entropy per particle @xmath68 .",
    "this makes the calculation more complicated than the one at zero chemical potential where it is sufficient to keep the temperature fixed . in our extension",
    "we take the condition  @xcite into account for non - zero baryon and strangeness chemical potentials , imposing overall strangeness zero .",

    "there is not much difference between the hrgm and ehrgm models at low temperature , @xmath75 since the heavy resonances do not play an important role there . alternatively , at high temperatures , @xmath76 , it should agree with the results of the lattice simulations of qcd @xcite . in our case",
    ", we have determined the temperature and chemical potential dependencies of the pressure and the number , energy and entropy densities using the chemical freeze - out curve  @xcite . using these results ,",
    "we have then calculated the speed of sound .",

    "the velocity of sound at @xmath88 is different from zero ; it is expected to become zero but due to finite volume effects .",
    "in this paper we have made a new analysis of the number of hadronic resonances using the latest information from the particle data group  @xcite .",
