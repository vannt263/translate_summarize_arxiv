    "accretion disks are presently thought as the scenario for hydrodynamical flows in close binary systems , galactic nuclei and quasars . despite this fast growing recognition , models which allow for some particle processes , taking into account the detailed nature of the flow , as well as realistic processes that may act as the source for the required viscosity , are still lacking .",
    "concerning particles processes , most of the theoretical work on the field has focused on the production of positron - electron pairs .",
    "steady state scenarios , under the assumption of production - annihilation equilibrium , have been first tackled by @xcite , who found that , if particle - particle dominates pair creation , equilibrium is only possible for lepton temperature below @xmath8 , @xcite , @xcite , and by @xcite , who considered pair production dominated by gamma - gamma interactions , in a plasma under wien equilibrium , finding multivalued solutions to the disk structure .",
    "these results , however , are applicable only to a small region of parameter space or to a subset of important reactions .",
    "more general studies have been subsequently carried out by many authors @xcite , which contributed to a better understanding of radiative processes in very hot astrophysical plasmas , opening the way to the understanding of the topology of the disk equations solution , which at fixed @xmath9 in the @xmath10 plane forms an s - shape kink corresponding to its multiple valued nature @xcite .",
    "this multivalueness consists of three branches , two of them being hot ( one pair dominated and the other pair deficient ) and the third being cool and pair deficient .",
    "the hot pair dominated branch is very promising to explain some especial features in some black hole candidates , like the mev bump of cygnus x-1 , the radio plasmoid bipolar outflow of the jet sources , and the alleged annihilation line features @xcite .",
    "it may happen that , under the conditions prevailing in the innermost parts of some systems , the time needed for the matter to cross these regions is comparable to , or even less than , the time the electrons need to extract energy from the protons , through collisional energy exchange .",
    "these regions will grow in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the disk , becoming geometrically thick ( swelling of the disk may also occur for systems with eddington or super eddington luminosities @xcite , not considered in this paper ) . from angular momentum transport point of view , collective processes are efficiently operative to generate viscosity ( due to the protons ) , but with a deficient cooling ( due to the electrons ) .",
    "this drives protons and electrons out of thermal equilibrium , the ion temperature being much greater and close to the virial one . for a disk around a maximally ( synchronously ) rotating kerr black hole the inner radius of the disk may reach the horizon , with the ion temperature approaching the mass of the proton .",
    "a two temperature geometrically thicker and optically thin disk model was first developed by @xcite to explain the hard x - ray from cygnus x-1 .",
    "these authors , however , have not considered radial advection of energy and entropy which , in that situation , are very important and the local approximation breaks down .",
    "advection of energy in optically thin disks was first considered by @xcite , in the context of the bimodal behavior of the x - ray spectra from cygnus x-1 , @xcite who considered advection in an optically thin , two - temperature disk , and by @xcite who studied advection of energy and pairs in optically thin disks .",
    "@xcite , have unraveled the basic physics of advection in accretion flows with their studies on the properties and structure of optically thick disks . however , only recently , advective cooling in optically thin accretion flows has been recognized thanks to a systematic work by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "neglecting pairs , these authors have studied the topology of the solution in the @xmath10 plane , showing the existence of a maximum accretion rate , above which no steady state solution is allowed , and that , below it , there are two optically thin solutions , namely the radiative cooling dominated and the advective cooling dominated states .",
    "a general description of flows in accretion disks , taking advection into account and neglecting pairs , was given by @xcite .",
    "they have shown that , at a given radius , there exist exactly four physically distinct types of accretion disks .",
    "two of these correspond to values of @xmath11 , the viscosity parameter , smaller than a critical value , and the other two , to values of @xmath11 greater than this critical value .",
    "inclusion of pairs have been considered by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , who have shown that pairs do not modify the topology of the solution , besides being negligible for @xmath12 .",
    "it should be remarked that , though the advective model constitutes an improvement as far as the standard shakura and sunyaev disk model is considered , till the moment , no global solution exists for the disk @xcite .",
    "at this point , we must realize the importance of the viscosity parameter and , yet , we do nt know the physical process that may be the source for such a viscosity . since the seminal paper by @xcite , a lot of mechanisms",
    "have been proposed to account for viscosity : shear turbulence generated by the keplerian rotation of the disk @xcite , turbulence driven by convection @xcite , tangled magnetic fields sheared by differential rotation @xcite , angular momentum transport by waves @xcite , velikov - chandrasekhar magnetic instability @xcite , ion viscosity and neutron viscosity @xcite , radiative viscosity @xcite .",
    "none of these processes , however , is immune to criticism : concerning shear turbulence , disks satisfy rayleigh s criterion for stability ; convection may transport angular momentum inwards rather than outwards ; magnetic field may be removed by magnetic buoyance and ohmic dissipation ; concerning wave turbulence , it seems that the most stable mode have low wavenumbers , giving rise to structures of the order of the size of the system , being very sensitive to the coriolis force which hinders the appearance of smaller structures ; the velikov - chandrasekhar instability is highly dependent on the radial structure of the azimuthal component of the magnetic field , and can only occur if the alfvn velocity is of the order of the keplerian one , or if the typical scale of the magnetic field is smaller than the keplerian one ; as far as ion viscosity is concerned , besides needing high temperatures ( the system needs another process to achieve these high temperatures ) , any small magnetic field present in the flow will decrease the strength of the viscosity by orders of magnitude ; neutron viscosity needs high temperature to ignite nuclear reactions capable _  _ to produce neutrons , needing , therefore , some other process _  _ to heat up particles till these high temperatures ; keplerian thin disks can not be supported by radiative viscosity , because the required energy density of the photon gas should be one or two orders of magnitude larger .    in view of all these uncertainties concerning the hydrodynamics of the flow , as well as the angular momentum transport in accretion disks ,",
    "we would like to consider neutron viscosity , assuming neutron production through helium break up and through pion production due to proton - proton collisions .",
    "the threshold for helium breakup is about 20 mev and about 290 mev for the production of pions ( and neutrons ) in the proton - proton collision .",
    "close to the horizon , the energy in the rest frame of two colliding protons is about 2 gev , which means that , at least theoretically , these reactions are energetically viable .",
    "the real difficulty is to find conditions in parameter space , if they exist , such that the plasma is no longer ruled by electromagnetic interactions alone and nuclear interactions start playing a role .",
    "effectiveness of strong interactions depends not only on the value of ion temperature itself but also on the electron temperature .",
    "this is so because electromagnetic interactions are restricted to the debye sphere and the number of electrons within it decreases with electron temperature .",
    "high electron temperature will favor , not only the production of electron - positron pairs , but also the possibility of nuclear reactions .",
    "one has to realize we are here dealing with a very intricate situation highly dependent on the viscosity .",
    "it is well known , that for a given density , electron and proton temperatures , drift time decreases with increasing viscosity parameter while @xmath13 , the electron - proton collision time , has inverse behavior .",
    "however , physical variables in the disk are very sensitive functions of the viscosity parameter and we have to make a self - consistent calculation to find a region in parameter space where the nuclear reactions effects are maximized .",
    "account for nuclear reactions in the accretion disks may have interesting observational consequences such as the lines spectral features of hydrogen - helium plasmas at high temperatures and @xmath14-ray lines production . from the theoretical point of view , helium breakup and pion production reactions produce neutrons whose collisions with the accreting matter may be a source for the viscosity in the disk , which , in turn , will depend upon electron temperature , proton temperature and accretion rate .",
    "this may have interesting consequences as far as the topology of the solution is concerned .",
    "this is a problem we want to tackle in a future work .",
    "however , in the present paper , it should be stressed , our main concern is to find out if neutron production through proton - proton collisions is viable in the innermost region in accretion disks , and if its collisions with the accreting matter can drive accretion on .",
    "we will , therefore , be interested only in order of magnitude estimates . keeping this on mind",
    ", we will make some reasonable approximations , mainly on the radiative transport , pair production and on the hydrodynamics , which , at the right moment , will be justified .",
    "a potentially promising application of the afore mentioned reactions is the modelling of some x - ray systems , like cygnus x-1 , that exhibit multimodal behavior . in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", it was shown that although these reactions , in steady state accretion , can not supply the disk with enough neutrons to make their collisions with the accreting matter the main source of viscosity , they may have strong implications as far as the temporal behavior of the disks is concerned .",
    "we have considered , however , only the production of neutrons through the @xmath0he breakup reaction @xmath15for ion temperatures greater than @xmath16 mev . assuming that a steady accretion can be achieved with the drift time equal to the nuclear reaction time , we were able to show the existence of a critical accretion rate , below which there is no steady state accretion onto the hole . above the critical accretion rate it is possible , under special circumstances , for the disk to choose between the two states of steady accretion .",
    "this kind of procedure has to be criticized on the grounds that equality between drift and nuclear reaction times is a very stringent constraint and , at the temperature range considered , electron - positron pair production should be taken into account .",
    "besides , as we approach the hole , ion temperature can be much greater and even exceed the threshold temperature for the reaction @xmath17    we claim that accounting of both reactions in the inner parts of an accretion disk together with allowance for thermal instability may explain the transitions observed in cygnus x-1 , between the states of high and low luminosity .",
    "there is a widely accepted suspicion that the unseen compact object in the binary system cygnus x-1 is a black hole @xcite .",
    "support for this suspicion is found on detailed analyses carried on radial velocity measurements as well as on recent analyses based on spectrum synthesis @xcite both of which give a mass of about @xmath18 , comfortably larger than the @xmath19 upper limit of a neutron star mass .",
    "the luminosity is sub - eddington , but greater than @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "cygnus x-1 , being one of the most studied sources in the sky , especially in the hard x - rays , some of its properties ( characteristic hard x - ray spectrum , episodic emergence of an ultra soft component , anticorrelated soft and hard x - ray transitions , chaotic variability down to milliseconds , persistent gamma - ray tail above an mev , episodic gamma - ray bumps at a few hundred kev - mev , persistent radio emission and radio flaring correlated with x - ray transitions and low - frequency quasi periodic oscillations ( qpo ) ) have been accepted as evidence for black hole candidacy @xcite .",
    "observations usually find the system in one of the two states : the hard state and the soft state @xcite .",
    "most of the time , cygnus x-1 is found in the hard state , where its soft x - ray ( 2 - 10 kev ) is relatively low and the hard x - ray spectrum is hard . after being in this state for a few years",
    ", the system undergoes a transition to the soft state , increasing its soft x - ray flux by a factor of about 10 , softening its x - ray spectrum .",
    "it remains in the soft state from weeks to months before returning to the hard state .",
    "the transition between the two states lasts from less than a day to more than a week @xcite . in the hard state",
    ", cygnus x-1 has a power law spectrum characterized by a photon index @xmath21 . during the hard state the soft x - ray spectrum below 10",
    "kev is often a simple continuation of the hard x - ray power law , with increasing flattening below 3 kev . in that case , the entire x - ray continuum is likely produced by a single hot component .",
    "however , during some episodes of cygnus x-1 hard state , the best fit model still requires a small black - body component of temperature a few tenths of kev on the top of the power law , presuming the existence of another region of lesser temperature @xcite .",
    "this is highly suggestive of a soft photon source , as expected in the inverse compton model .",
    "in addition there is often evidence of the fek - edge absorption at @xmath22 7 kev @xcite .",
    "when cygnus x-1 is in the soft state , its spectrum switches to one that is dominated by an ultrasoft component , with a temperature @xmath23 kev .",
    "the spectrum above 10 kev becomes much softer than in the hard state , with a variable photon index @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "it exhibits , also , pair annihilation features in the region @xmath25 kev @xcite .",
    "the region we shall be concerned extends away from @xmath26 , inner radius of the disk , to approximately @xmath27 to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , @xmath30 being the gravitational radius",
    ".    we shall assume conditions such that the ion temperature , @xmath31 , is much greater than @xmath32 , the electron temperature , with pressure given by the ions .",
    "in the outermost parts of the disk , matter composition is hydrogen ( nine tenth ) and helium ( one tenth ) . in its way down to the hole , he depletion starts and the neutrons produced gradually contributes to the viscosity .",
    "as the incoming matter comes closer to the hole , charge exchange reactions start to contribute to the neutron production .",
    "concomitant to these reactions , electron - positron pairs are radioactively produced .",
    "we shall assume production - annihilation equilibrium .",
    "we shall also assume an external source of soft photons that are continuously impinging upon the disk .",
    "part of these soft photons succeed being upscattered in energy , reaching the wien peak where they interact and produce pairs .",
    "the remaining are upscattered , but leave the disk before reaching the wien peak .",
    "both nuclear reactions we are considering are endothermic , so they lower the plasma temperature by taking the energy they need to ignite . for the helium breakup ,",
    "the number of the resulting particles is greater than the number of the interacting particles .",
    "these particles have to be thermalized and so act as an additional source of cooling .",
    "the pion produced by the charge exchange reaction rapidly decay , producing a positron that has to be thermalized and a neutrino that leaves the system , cooling the disk even more .",
    "our model has axial symmetry , the azimuthal velocity being keplerian , and hydrostatic equilibrium holds in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the disk , with the pressure given by the nucleons .",
    "the disk is heated by viscous processes and locally cooled by radiation and by nuclear reactions .",
    "this innermost region is surrounded by a region in which matter is completely depleted of he , due to breakup . out of this neighboring region",
    ", we assume the existence of some unknown process that heats the gas and makes he breakup viable .",
    "since the nucleon temperature should be close to the virial one for charge exchange reactions to occur , the disk will be geometrically thick , and advection should be important .",
    "however , the more important advection is , the less important is the radiative cooling , and the greater the nucleon temperature will be , a fact that favors the onset of nuclear reactions .",
    "contradictory as it may seem , we do nt know by sure the effect on the nuclear reaction rate by the neglecting of advection .",
    "besides this , @xcite have studied the behavior of advection as a function of the accretion rate and of the viscosity parameter , concluding for its importance of for small values of @xmath33 ( in eddington units ) . as @xmath33 increases , from @xmath34 to a critical value that depends on the viscosity parameter , the advection zone becomes very luminous .",
    "the advection zone shrinks in size with further increase of the accretion rate , and for sufficiently large values it disappears , with the thin disk extending down to the marginally stable orbit . in this paper",
    "we are interested in order of magnitude estimates , and accounting of advection would make our calculations very complex .",
    "@xcite has taken conductive transport into account in the inner geometrically thick region of a two temperature soft comptonized accretion disk in cygnus x-1 , showing that this process is much more important than radiative cooling . for a matter of consistency , were advection included , we should also have included conduction , which would render the problem much more complicated .",
    "hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction reads @xmath35where @xmath36 is the density , @xmath37 is the keplerian angular velocity and @xmath38 is the semi - scale height of the disk .",
    "@xmath39 , the total pressure , is mainly given by the pressure due to the protons , i.e. , @xmath40@xmath41 being the proton number density , @xmath42 the boltzmann constant .",
    "ion temperature is in units of @xmath43 and electron temperature in units of @xmath44 .",
    "unless otherwise stated , physical variables are expressed in the cgs system of units .",
    "combining eq .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) we obtain @xmath45    mass conservation , together with conservation of angular momentum and the definition of the viscosity parameter yield @xmath46 which implies for the column density @xmath47 @xmath7 being the viscosity parameter , @xmath48 is the accretion and @xmath49is a function that depends on the boundary condition imposed on the torque at the inner radius . for @xmath50 ,",
    "the heat flux , viscously generated , going into the disk at a distance @xmath51 from the central object , @xmath52    in the two - temperature regime , energy is collisionally transferred from protons to electrons and pairs at a rate , corrected for the inclusion of neutrons , given by @xcite @xmath53where @xmath54 is the total neutron abundance , @xmath55 is the abundance due to pion production and @xmath56 is the positron density to proton density ratio .",
    "the electrons and pairs , in turn , loose energy through unsaturated inverse comptonization of externally supplied soft photons . like @xcite , we shall assume these photons are copiously supplied and that the kompaneetz @xmath57 parameter is constant and equal to @xmath58 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath59where @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 otherwise , @xmath63 for @xmath64 and @xmath62 otherwise .",
    "we shall assume that the intensity of the soft photons coming from the external source overwhelms the intensity due to photons internally produced ( bremsstrahlung ) .",
    "with the inclusion of neutrons , the electron scattering depth changes to @xmath65@xmath66 being the thomson cross section for electron scattering and @xmath67 the proton mass .",
    "clearly , this way of treating the radiative problem in the disk relies heavily on the existence of an external soft photon source , which we assume , from the very beginning , as granted .",
    "we should emphasize , since our main concern is not the radiative problem , we adopt this procedure for practical reasons : the spectrum of these soft photons , after being upscattered in energy , through unsaturated inverse comptonization in the inner region , reproduces fairly well the observed spectrum of cygnus x-1 , in the 8 - 500 kev region @xcite .    for the moment",
    "we postpone the discussion about the cooling of the disk due to breakup and pion production .",
    "we next discuss pair production in the disk .",
    "as we have emphasized before , our main concern in this paper is find out the possibility of occurrence of nuclear reactions in the inner region of the disk .",
    "we , therefore , construct a reasonable and realistic environment of photons and pairs , in which the nuclear reactions take place . as we have done in the case of radiative transport",
    ", we shall make some simplifications when treating the pairs .",
    "we assume pairs are created mainly by wien photons interacting with wien photons .",
    "however , instead of writing down the formal pair equilibrium equation , we shall adopt a procedure similar to @xcite paper .",
    "this essentially consists in relating the photon chemical potential to the soft photon flux .",
    "this kind of procedure is valid as long as the plasma is in wien equilibrium @xcite , which implies @xmath68 .",
    "below , we briefly review this procedure .    for @xmath69 , @xmath70 ,",
    "the photon occupation number , obeys the kompaneetz equation . in that limit",
    "@xmath71where @xmath72 is the photon chemical potential and @xmath73 .",
    "the occupation number @xmath74 for positrons and electrons may be written , respectively,@xmath75@xmath76since the number of particles is conserved in the reaction @xmath77the chemical potential should satisfy @xmath78for cygnus x-1 and related sources @xmath79 , which implies @xmath80 . the radiative cooling will be @xmath81    now , using eqs .",
    "( 12 ) , ( 13 ) , ( 14 ) , ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) we obtain @xmath82 where @xmath83 is given by @xmath84 @xmath85 being the modified bessel function of 2nd kind and we have substituted in the slowly varying function @xmath86 for canonical values appropriate for cygnus x-1 .    it is worth mentioning that the radiative cooling now will be given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the nuclear cooling .",
    "adopting the procedure as we did to treat radiative cooling and pair production we have overestimated both processes . since the energy production is constant , this implies in underestimation of the nuclear reaction rate .",
    "in the chain of reactions leading to the @xmath90 breakup @xmath91@xmath92@xmath93@xmath94@xmath95@xmath96the one that takes longer to occur is the first one .",
    "once this reaction has ignited , the other follow very rapidly .",
    "so , we assume the breakup dominated by this reaction @xcite and use a prescription @xcite to write the neutron reaction rate for this reaction , @xmath97this implies a neutron abundance , @xmath98 , due to this reaction , given by , @xmath99the total neutron abundance @xmath54 will be given by @xmath100using eq .",

    "their calculations have been carried out under the prescription of the one boson exchange ( obe ) model , with allowance for the inclusion of both nucleon and delta isobar excitations in the intermediate states , as well as for the exchange of @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 mesons .",

    "as far as the requirement of huge ion temperatures needed to ignite pion production , we have assumed a maximally synchronously rotating kerr black hole , the inner radius of the disk equal to its horizon , @xmath172 .",
    "the region of the disk we were concerned is the one extending from the horizon to about @xmath173 . in the outer parts of the inner region , the contribution of the reaction @xmath174 to the production of neutrons is negligible , this being dominated by@xmath0he breakup , which we use as a kind of boundary condition .",
    "neutrons produced by this reaction contribute to the viscosity and the plasma heats up as we approach the hole , making possible the production of pions which , in turn , increase the viscosity by concomitant production of neutrons .",
    "the radiative cooling of the disk was assumed to be due to unsaturated inverse comptonization of soft external photons impinging upon the disk .",
    "since we have not considered the reaction @xmath175 , we have not taken into account the radiative cooling due to photons coming from the @xmath176 decay .",
    "part of those soft photons are upscattered in energy , reaching the wien peak where they interact with themselves producing pairs .",
    "radiative cooling and pair production decrease the electron temperature , an effect that hinders the efficiency of nuclear reactions , even if the ion temperature is great enough for them to occur .",
    "when @xmath32 decreases , the number of interacting electrons with one proton increases sharply , due to less shielding .",
    "nuclear forces only act at short distances and the high ion temperature needed to overcome the coulomb barrier also hinders the occurrence of nuclear events due to very short time in the nuclear range . as a matter of fact , reaction rate due to electromagnetic interactions prevails over the rate due to nuclear interactions",
    "if @xmath32 satisfies @xmath177however , the energy transferred in the ( electromagnetic ) scattering will be in the kev range , while for the nuclear reaction it will be in the mev range .",
    "therefore , the previous inequality changes roughly to @xmath178when one also considers the energy transferred in the event .",
    "aiming at the application to cygnus x-1 and related sources , we have set @xmath179 and @xmath165 which are much less than the critical value for @xmath180 calculated close to the horizon , i.e. , @xmath181 for both values of the accretion rate @xmath161 is larger than the value given by the ineq .",
    "( 43 ) . as a result , for every solution we have found , @xmath182 .",
    "this is surprising , since it is known that , in the absence of these reactions , one of the solutions for the two - temperature disk has @xmath183 .",
    "another surprising result we have found concerns the sensitivity of the number of solutions to the value of the accretion rate . calculating at @xmath156 and @xmath143 , for @xmath184 we have found the solution is unique . decreasing to @xmath165",
    "there are two solutions . for these values of the accretion rate",
    "the neutron abundance in the inner region is fairly high , going from @xmath185 in the outer border , with total @xmath89he depletion , to about twice that value close to the horizon .",
    "this implies @xmath186 quite large , i.e. , large viscosity .",
    "this large viscosity , nevertheless , comes along with a high nuclear cooling , being comparable to the radiative cooling .",
    "it is known that the innermost region of the accretion disk is secular and thermally unstable @xcitein the absence of nuclear reactions .",
    "taking into account these nuclear reactions , the disk behaves in the same manner at the very onset of these instabilities .",
    "however , it is worthwhile observing the behavior of the viscosity parameter with @xmath146 , because two scenarios may emerge as far as the time evolution of the inner region is concerned .",
    "@xmath187 starts growing , reaches a maximum somewhere between @xmath188 and @xmath189 , then decreases and may become very small , even null , with increasing @xmath146 . at that moment , accretion starts switching off and the cooling , that goes with @xmath190 , is practically instantaneous .",
    "outside this region , however , some other mechanism for viscosity generation is still operating and accretion , there , keeps going on .",
    "as the matter reaches the border of the inner region it gets piled up there . as this",
    "piling up goes on , this region will be subject to several instabilities .",
    "once one of these instabilities starts to grow it triggers accretion in the inner region . as the accretion proceeds , the accretion rate decreases till it reaches a value for which there are two steady states for the disk .",
    "which one will the disk choose ?",
    "at that moment , do both thermal and pair equilibrium hold in that region ? a less drastic scenario is the one somehow similar to that proposed by @xcite .",
    "physical processes in the disk are characterized by time scales , the one chosen by the system being the least scale .",
    "as we have seen , thermal and pair equilibrium only hold under special circumstances .",
    "it may happen that due to the nuclear reactions and instabilities in the disk , the system may undergo a kind of limit cycle behavior around the upper solution .    however , to have a better understanding of the time evolution of these systems we should make better treatment of both radiative cooling and pair production and a more detailed stability analysis of the problem as well .",
    "that is what we intend to do next , in a future contribution , taking also into account the reaction @xmath191 .",
