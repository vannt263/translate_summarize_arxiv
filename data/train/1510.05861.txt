    "onsager s study of the conductivity of strong electrolytes is famous as one of his first major scientific contributions . in this work",
    "he showed how the theory developed by debye and hckel @xcite should be modified to take into account the effect of brownian motion on the ions @xcite .",
    "for an electroneutral system with two ionic species @xmath0 with ionic charges @xmath1 ( @xmath2 denoting the signed valency ) , mobilities @xmath3 and average densities @xmath4 , the naive formula for the conductivity , which neglects the interaction between the ions , is @xmath5    debye and hckel @xcite computed a correction to this bare conductivity due to the flow induced on the solvent by the charge distribution about an ion .",
    "onsager later pointed out how this result is changed ( essentially additively at the level of approximation employed ) by the brownian motion of the ions and their mutual interaction @xcite .",
    "indeed it is clear that even in the absence of the solvent the conductivity will be modified by correlations between the ions : an ion moves in an electric field which is the sum of the uniform applied field and the field generated by the other ions in the system .",
    "onsager then went on to study the conductivity of strong and weak electrolytes in the presence of a finite applied field @xcite . for strong electrolytes",
    "the modification due to the finite electric field is that the debye screening of charges is killed off by the field and thus the conductivity increases  the so - called wien effect @xcite . for weak electrolytes ,",
    "which consists of free anions and cations along with bound bjerrum pairs , the external field has the effect of shifting the chemical equilibrium between ions and bjerrum pairs ( by pulling the pairs apart ) @xcite .",
    "this shift increases the density of charge carriers , leading to an increase in conductivity .",
    "the validity of onsager s calculation for weak electrolytes was verified recently , for a solvent free system , by numerical simulations of the second wien effect @xcite .",
    "interestingly , onsager returned regularly to this problem throughout his career , he compared it carefully with experimental results and also developed new mathematics to facilitate the study of these systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the problem of the conductivity of strong electrolytes for brownian systems ( we do not consider the effect of a solvent here ) by analysing the stochastic density functional theory ( sdft ) for the density field of the interacting particles .",
    "the sdft in question was first written down by kawasaki @xcite on phenomenological grounds but was later shown formally to be the equation of evolution for the density field of interacting brownian particles @xcite .",
    "the sdft is analytically intractable when the particles interact , and very difficult to analyse even when there are no interactions @xcite , however it can be used as the starting point for various approximate theories , for example mode coupling theory @xcite .",
    "recently it was shown that the linearised sdft for charged particle systems yields a dynamical theory which has the debye - hckel theory as its static limit @xcite .",
    "this has allowed the study of the dynamics of the thermal casimir effect between adjacent plates containing brownian charges .",
    "the same type of linearization approximation can also be used to compute the effective diffusion constant of a brownian tracer particle in interaction with a bath of identical particles  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the result obtained from this computation is identical to that obtained by an arduous one - loop renormalisation group analysis of the full @xmath6 particle fokker - planck equation  @xcite .",
    "finally we remark that the sdft has even been used to derive integration results in random matrix theory  @xcite .    here",
    "we will show how onsager s results for electrolyte conductivity can be derived in a relatively straightforward fashion . as well as considering the case of a globally electroneutral electrolyte with two species of oppositely charged ions",
    ", we also deal with mobile ions that are not as an ensemble electroneutral . in this case",
    ", the mobile ion s total charge is neutralized by a uniform immobile background charge  a so - called jellium model .",
    "we also generalize these results for the conductivity to lower dimensions @xmath7 with the corresponding @xmath7-dimensional coulomb interaction .",
    "finally , our results can be extended to systems with reduced dimension , for example ions confined to a two dimensional surface .",
    "we will consider a system containing two species of brownian particles which interact via pairwise interactions and which are acted on by a uniform external field .",
    "the basic formalism developed here can be applied to systems with an arbitrary number of species , however the reader will see below that on increasing the number of species the calculations become rather cumbersome .",
    "we will ultimately apply this model to the case of electrostatic interactions between charged particles in the presence of an applied field .",
    "the formalism developed however allows the possibility of including additional interactions between the ions .",
    "let each species be denoted by an index @xmath8 taking the label @xmath9 or @xmath10 depending if the ion is a cation or anion respectively .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the local density operator of the species @xmath8 and @xmath3 its mobility .",
    "we denote by @xmath12 the pairwise interaction between species @xmath8 and @xmath13",
    ". we will ultimately decompose the pairwise interaction @xmath12 into an electrostatic and non - electrostatic contribution as @xmath14 here @xmath15 denotes the green s function for the electrostatic interaction in the system , @xmath16 is the basic unit of charge and @xmath2 denotes the valency of the ions of type @xmath8 .",
    "the interaction @xmath17 denotes interactions other than the direct electrostatic interaction that may be present in the system , for example hard and soft core interactions .",
    "note that in the case where there is a neutralizing uniform background charge ( jellium model ) there is no contribution to the electric field due to this uniform charge .    at temperature @xmath18 ,",
    "the density fields obey the sdft  @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a gaussian white noise with correlation function @xmath21 in the above we have introduced the force @xmath22 generated by the applied external field @xmath23 and the interactions between the ions : @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the convolution over spatial variables .",

    ", we have to solve the system of equations ( [ eq : correlation_stationnary ] ) .",

    "the weak coupling approach applied here is clearly only valid in the conducting phase .",
    "* for @xmath85 , the correction is proportional to @xmath95 and is thus small at high densities , however the long range nature of the electric field generated by one dimensional charges means that the one dimensional problem is not very realistic .",
