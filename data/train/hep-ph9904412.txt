    "we now determine a lower bound on the higgs boson mass in the sm @xcite .",
    "we first alert the reader to our phenomenologically viable assumption that the physical vacuum corresponds to a global , not merely a local , minimum of the effective potential .",
    "this assumption is consistent with our intention to accept the sm as a truly valid theory and compute the consequences , i.e. to zeroth order there is no motivation to consider the physical vacuum to be anything other than the true vacuum . if one considers the possibility that the physical vacuum is a metastable vacuum with a lifetime longer than the age of the universe , that there exist deeper minima of the potential , then the sm lower bounds on the higgs boson mass become less stringent in general for certain choices of @xmath16 and @xmath1 , where @xmath16 is the cutoff beyond which the sm is no longer valid @xcite .",
    "but , for @xmath17 gev and @xmath18 gev , the sm3 absolute stability lower bound is relaxed by only @xmath19 gev when one only imposes metastability requirements , and this small effect only becomes diminished with the inclusion of a fourth generation .",
    "we obtain lower limits on the sm higgs boson mass by requiring stability of this observed vacuum .",
    "it is well known that lower values of @xmath16 relax the sm lower bounds @xcite , but we note that the lower bounds on the sm higgs boson mass are insensitive to the precise value of @xmath16 for large @xmath16 , i.e. for @xmath20 gev @xmath21 gev .",
    "working with the two - loop rge requires the imposition of one - loop boundary conditions on the running parameters @xcite . as pointed out by casas et al .",
    "@xcite , the necessary condition for vacuum stability is derived from requiring that the effective coupling @xmath22 0 rather than @xmath23 for @xmath24 , where @xmath16 is the cut - off beyond which the sm is no longer valid .",
    "the effective coupling @xmath25 in the sm4 is defined as : @xmath26 \\right\\}\\ ] ] where the three generation case is simply the same as the above expression without the fourth generation yukawa coupling contributions .",
    "choosing @xmath18 gev and @xmath27 gev , we arrive at a vacuum stability lower bound on @xmath28 of @xmath8 134 gev for the sm with three generations . allowing @xmath1 to be as large as 179",
    "gev increases the lower bound on @xmath2 to @xmath8 150 gev .    to compute the mssm upper bound on @xmath2",
    ", we assume that all of the sparticles have masses @xmath29 or greater and that of the two higgs isodoublets of the mssm , one linear combination is massive , also with a mass of @xmath29 or greater , while the other linear combination , orthogonal to the first , has a mass of the order of weak - scale symmetry breaking . with these two assumptions ,",
    "it is clear that below the supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath30 , the effective theory is the sm .",
    "this fact enables us to use the sm effective potential for the higgs boson when we treat the lightest higgs boson in the mssm .    in the mssm(3,4 ) , the boundary condition for @xmath12 at @xmath30 is @xmath31\\cos^{2}(2\\beta)+\\frac{\\kappa_{i}h_{i}^{4}(m_{susy})}{16 \\pi^{2}}\\left ( 2\\frac{x_{i}}{m_{susy}^{2}}-\\frac{x_{i}^{4}}{6 m_{susy}^{4 } } \\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath32 = 3 for @xmath33 and @xmath32 = 1 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the supersymmetric mixing parameter for the ith fermion .",
    "zero threshold corrections correspond to @xmath35 = 0 .",
    "maximum threshold corrections occur for @xmath36 . -1",

    "( 1 ) we present our numerical two - loop results for the lightest higgs boson mass bounds in the sm and the mssm3 as a function of the supersymmetric parameter @xmath37 .",
    "the bottom two curves correspond to the mssm3 upper bound for the two cases @xmath27 gev and the slightly greater upper bound that results when @xmath1 = 179 gev and with no threshold corrections .",
    "when the case of maximum threshold corrections is considered , these two curves are translated upwards by @xmath8 55 gev - 60 gev , illustrating the strong dependence of the upper bound on the precise value of the threshold corrections .",
    "yet even with such a dramatic increase in the upper bounds with increasing threshold corrections , we observe that the sm lower bound exceeds the mssm upper bound for @xmath27 gev and @xmath38 for all values of the threshold correction contribution . similarly , for @xmath39 gev , the troublesome situation is only exacerbated , as the sm lower bound exceeds the mssm upper bound for @xmath40 independent of the threshold corrections .    in fig.(2 ) we present the problem more clearly . taking into account the present experimental lower limit on @xmath2 of @xmath8 90 gev at 95@xmath41 cl , we find the value of the threshold correction that gives a smallest upper bound consistent with the experimental lower limit .",
    "clearly , for this phenomenologically determined lower limit of the threshold contributions , there is a large area in @xmath42 space that is inconsistent with both the sm and the mssm . for @xmath27 gev , the region 92 gev",
    "@xmath43 134 gev invalidates both theories independent of @xmath37 , while for @xmath39 gev , the range of mutual invalidiation is 92 gev @xmath43 150 gev .",
    "to resolve the above conundrum , one would like to either raise the mssm upper bounds , lower the sm lower bounds , or both . upon adding a fourth generation , the sm4 lower bounds",
    "exceed the sm3 lower bounds and are an increasing function of the fourth generation masses .",
    "if a higgs is detected in the region of mutual invalidation of both the sm and the mssm , consideration of sm4 vacuum stability lower bounds only exacerbates the problem .",
    "it is readily apparent that the way out of the area of inconsistency is to consider the mssm4 and see if the additional matter of the mssm4 results in mssm4 upper bounds that exceed the sm3 lower bounds .",
    "we now discuss restrictions on the possible fourth generation fermion masses @xcite . the close agreement betweeen the direct measurements of the top quark at the tevatron and its indirect determination from the global fits of precision electroweak data including radiative corrections within the framework of the sm",
    "imply that there is no significant violation of the isospin symmetry for the extra generation .",
    "thus the masses of the fourth generation isopartners must be very close to degenerate @xcite ; i.e. @xmath44 recently , the limit on the masses of the extra neutral and charged lepton masses , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , has been improved by lep1.5 to @xmath47 gev and @xmath48 gev .",
    "also , cdf has yielded a lower bound on @xmath7 of @xmath8 140 gev .    in our previous work",
    ", we considered a completely degenerate fourth generation of fermions with mass @xmath49 .",
    "we derived an upper bound on @xmath49 in the mssm4 by demanding pertubative validity of all the couplings out to the gut scale @xcite .",
    "this constraint led to an upper bound on @xmath49 of @xmath8 110 gev .",
    "the above experimental lower limit on @xmath7 naturally forces us to now a consider a fourth generation where degeneracy only holds among the isodoublets seperately .",
    "we therefore consider a fourth generation with masses @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    in fig.(3 )",
    ", we present the sm lower bound , the mssm4 upper bound with the fourth generation masses at their experimental lower limits and with fourth generation masses large enough to remove the problem area for all values of @xmath37 .",
    "the mssm bounds were calculated with no threshold corrections , and @xmath1 is fixed at 172 gev .",
    "fig.(4 ) shows the same information for @xmath1 = 179 gev .",
    "the mssm4 upper bounds are much more sensitive to @xmath4 than they are to @xmath3 .",
    "this qualitative behaviour is readily understood from inspection of the equation for @xmath50 .",
    "for this reason , it is necessary to increase @xmath4 appropriately in order to generate a mssm4 upper bound that is greater than the sm lower bound for all values of @xmath37 . in fact , keeping @xmath4 at 146 gev and allowing @xmath3 to be 110 gev does not resolve the problem . but increasing both @xmath4 and @xmath3 as indicated in the figures does remove the problem .",
    "because all of the bounds increase as @xmath3 and @xmath4 increase , and because the upper bounds on @xmath49 from the previous work are saturated when the masses of the fourth generation reach some critical values from below , we can conclude that @xmath3 must still be @xmath51 gev .",
    "this conclusion follows because it is @xmath52 that violates pertubative validity , so in the non - degenerate case , it is @xmath3 that must still respect this upper bound if gauge coupling unification is still to be achieved in the mssm4 .",
