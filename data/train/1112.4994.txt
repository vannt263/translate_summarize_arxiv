    "the percolation of strings @xcite@xcite@xcite have described successfully the basic facts , obtained at rhic and lhc , of the physics of qcd matter at higher energy .",
    "strings are supposed to describe confined qcd interactions in an effective way .",
    "they carry color charges at the ends and an extended color field between the charges .",
    "they emit particles by string breaking and pair creation .",
    "projected in the impact parameter they look like disks of radius @xmath0 fm and two - dimensional percolation theory can be applied . as the energy or the size of the projectile or target increases interaction between strings occurs due to the overlapping of the strings and",
    "the general result , due to the @xmath1 random summation of color charges , is that there is a reduction in multiplicity , and an increase in the string tension of formed clusters which means an increase of @xmath2 .",
    "the relevant variable is the transverse string density @xmath3 , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of strings and @xmath6 the overlapping area . for @xmath3 larger than a critical value",
    "@xmath7 a large cluster extends over the whole surface covering the fraction @xmath8 of the total area which at @xmath9 is approximately @xmath10 . for homogeneous surface @xmath11 and for more realistic profiles",
    "@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the basic formulae are , for particle density @xcite@xcite @xmath13 and for @xmath2 @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the color reduction factor @xmath16 and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the multiplicity and mean @xmath19 produced by the fragmentation of a single string",
    ".    the multiplicity distribution can be obtained from the cluster size distribution which approximately is a gamma function and the multiplicity distribution of the cluster , which we assume poisson like . in this way , we obtain the negative binomial distribution @xcite .",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 is given by ( 5 ) and @xmath22 is identical to @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number of effective color sources and @xmath25 the normalized two particle correlation . since , from ( 3 ) the size area of one effective cluster @xmath26 , and the area covered by strings is @xmath27 @xmath28 is given by @xcite .",
    "@xmath29 note that @xmath30 we observe that in the low density limit , there is not overlapping of strings and the particle density is essentially poisson and we have @xmath31 . in the large @xmath3 limit ,",
    "the @xmath24 effective strings behave like a single string , with @xmath32 and therefore @xmath33 . at intermediate densities",
    ", @xmath22 has a minimum close to the critical @xmath34 , @xmath22 is given by @xcite .",
    "@xmath35    in the glasma picture of color glass condensate also is obtained a negative binomial distribution . in cgc",
    "the multiplicity is given by the number of color flux tube ( strings ) , @xmath36 , times the number of gluons produced by one , which is proportional to @xmath37 .",
    "on the other hand , k is the number of flux tubes , @xmath36 , which in the limit of high density coincides with ( 9 ) having the same @xmath38 and @xmath39 dependencies .    concerning the @xmath40 distributions , assuming a gaussian decay of each cluster",
    ", whose width is given by ( 3 ) and taking into account the gamma function distribution as the cluster size distribution we obtain the following distribution @xcite[8 - 10 ] @xmath41 this formula is not valid for high @xmath40 because we have assumed a gaussian distribution for the decay of a cluster without any power behavior corresponding to hard emissions . in ( 10 )",
    "the @xmath42 is a function of @xmath3 which has a qualitative similar dependence that @xmath22 ( may differ in the range of integration ) . at low @xmath40 , ( 10 )",
    "behaves like @xmath43 and at moderate @xmath40 has a power like behavior .",
    "the formula ( 10 ) is valid at all energies and centralities including pp collisions , and gives a right description of rhic and lhc data , up to @xmath44 gev / c .",
    "note that at low energy density ( 10 ) behaves like @xmath45 . as the energy density increases",
    ", @xmath42 decreases and there is a departure of the exponential behavior .",
    "however above critical point @xmath42 increases again and it is recover the exponential behavior .",
    "the new lhc data has shown that the multiplicity at central rapidity rise faster in central @xmath46 collisions than in pp collisions .",
    "on the other hand , the data show the dependence in the centrality of the multiplicity in aa is the same at lhc and rhic energies .",
    "these two facts are explained in our approach .",
    "the apparently different behavior of the multiplicities is due to energy conservation.in fact , in @xmath46 collisions the number of strings grows like the number of collisions , @xmath47 , and the energy available only grows like a. therefore , at not very high energy , there will be strings that can not be formed because there is not energy available .",
    "we take into account this effect assuming that the number of strings increases like @xmath48 where @xmath49 is @xmath50 at low energy and goes to @xmath51 at very high energy . in this way",
    "we obtain @xcite .",
    "@xmath52,\\ ] ] with @xmath53 and @xmath54    in fig .  1 we show our results for @xmath55 together with the data for aa and pp [ 12 - 14 ] .",

    "line in orange is the result of the formula ( 11 ) at 2.76 tev compared with alice data in purple . ]",
    "concerning the rapidity dependence , there is not limiting fragmentation scaling in the percolation approach @xcite and the evolution with energy is very different for different values of the pseudorapidity @xmath59 .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "3 where is shown @xmath60 for different @xmath59 values and their energy dependence .",
    "it is seen that for central pseudorapidity @xmath61 the energy dependence is weaker , @xmath62 , than for high multiplicity @xmath63 , that is @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the correlation introduced in formula ( 6 ) is relevant for the discussion of rapidity long range correlations and the ridge structure , first seen in au - au collisions and central cu - cu collisions at rhic as well in high multiplicity pp and pb - pb collisions at lhc . in those collisions",
    "it was detected a correlated broad peak of particles extended in rapidity and localized in an azimuthal angle .",
    "the strength of the ridge structure is proportional to @xmath65 .",
    "the ridge structure seen in high multiplicity pp events @xcite was predicted @xcite@xcite in the percolation approach , using equation ( 12 ) that indicates that the string density for high multiplicity events in pp at lhc is equivalent to the string density for au - au peripheral collisions a @xmath66 central collisions at @xmath67 gev .    in percolation",
    ", we have from ( 2 ) and ( 6 ) @xcite @xmath68 as the density and/or energy increases the height of the near side ridge structure increases slowly . similar behavior is found in cgc @xcite where @xmath69 the values of @xmath65 are related to the value of the parameter @xmath70 , which measures the rapidity long range correlations and it is defined by @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 stand for the multiplicity in a forward and backward bins , separated by some rapidity gap to avoid short range correlations in the numerator of ( 17 ) .",
    "it is shown that @xcite@xcite @xmath74 and therefore @xmath75 at low energy density @xmath76 , and at high density @xmath77 .",
    "similar behavior is obtained in cgc @xcite@xcite .",
    "notice that @xmath22 plays an important role in determining the long range rapidity correlations and also controls the inverse of the width of the kno distribution @xmath78 as a function of @xmath79 . as far as @xmath22 grows with energy density above the critical percolation value we predict that the width should decrease above this value . for minimum bias pp collisions",
    "the critical value is reached close to @xmath80 tev . the data on pp shows in the measured range ( up to 7 tev ) @xmath22 is decreasing @xcite .",
    "in a precisely @xmath81 , in aa or pp collisions the projected area in the impact parameter plane is a circle populated by disks approximately in a azimuthal uniform way . if @xmath82 we have a projected almond .",
    "if we imagine the projected almond to be obtained by a deformation of the circle , it is clear that the string density is larger along the smaller , @xmath83 axis , than the density along the @xmath84 axis .",
    "it is intrinsic anisotropy that determines the existence of elliptic flow @xmath85 .",
    "also energy loss arguments support an sizable @xmath85 .",
    "notice that in percolation we have in the initial state interactions of the partons of the individual strings as a consequence of the color arrangement which is produced inside the formed cluster .",
    "the fragmentation of this large cluster produces a thermal distribution of particles @xcite and provide us the required early thermalization as far as the fragmentation time is around 1 fm .    in order to compute @xmath85",
    "we introduce the transverse azimuthal density [ 26 - 28 ] .",
    "@xmath86 where @xmath87 @xmath88 and @xmath89 introducing ( 20 ) into the transverse momentum distribution ( 10 ) and expanding the resulting distribution in powers of @xmath90 , retaining the first two terms , we obtain @xmath91 ( \\frac{e^{-\\eta } -f(\\eta^{t})^{2}}{2 f(\\eta^{t})})\\frac{f(\\eta^{t})p^{2}_{t}/<p^{2}_{t}>_{1}}{(1+f(\\eta^{t})p^{2}_{t}/<p^{2}_{t}>_{1})}\\ ] ] we observe that at low @xmath40 the dependence on @xmath92 is given by @xmath93 which remain approximately constant for the values of @xmath92 corresponding to rhic and lhc .

    "we obtain a very good agreement with rhic and lhc data , only our results on @xmath96 are slightly different from data .",
    "notice that our results are obtained from the close universal formula ( 24 ) valid for all energies and centralities .",
    "apart from the parameter @xmath18 the only input is the string density @xmath3 fixed from the multiplicity .",

    "the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio is a measured of the fluidity and the rhic and lhc data show a low value , lower than most of the known substances . in string",
    "percolation we obtain also a low @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "in fact , in percolation the strong color field inside the large cluster produces de - acceleration which can be seen as a thermal temperature @xcite@xcite by means of hawking - unruh effect .",
    "the temperature is given by @xmath98 on the other hand , from the relativistic kinetic theory @xmath97 is given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the mean free path , n the number density and @xmath101 the transport cross section .    from equation ( 7 ) we have @xmath102 and @xmath103 from ( 26 ) and ( 27 )",
