    "vanishing electrical resistance has long been viewed as a harbinger of new physics in condensed matter since the discovery of superconductivity.@xcite transport studies of two - dimensional electron systems ( 2des ) supported this notion by revealing the quantum hall effects as correlates of vanishing diagonal resistance at low temperatures , @xmath6 , and high magnetic fields , @xmath7.@xcite in the recent past , low-@xmath7 transport studies under microwave irradiation in the 2des uncovered the possibility of eliminating backscattering by photo - excitation , without concurrent hall quantization.@xcite the experimental realization of such radiation - induced zero - resistance states , and associated @xmath8-periodic radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations expanded the experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite investigations of light - matter coupling in low - dimensional electronic systems .",
    "indeed , microwave excitation of semiconductor quantum wells and graphene ribbons is now viewed as an approach to artificially realizing a ( floquet ) topological insulator for possible applications in topological quantum computing and spintronics.@xcite    microwave - induced zero - resistance states appear when the associated @xmath8-periodic magnetoresistance oscillations grow in amplitude and become comparable to the dark resistance of the 2des .",
    "such oscillations , which exhibit nodes at cyclotron resonance and harmonics thereof,@xcite are now understood via the the displacement model,@xcite the non - parabolicity model,@xcite the inelastic model,@xcite and the radiation driven electron orbit model.@xcite recently , a magneto - plasmon approach has also been motivated.@xcite in theory , some of these mechanisms can drive the magnetoresistivity to negative values at the oscillatory minima .",
    "negative resistivity then triggers an instability in favor of current domain formation , and zero - resistance states.@xcite    a distinguishing feature between existing theories for the radiation - induced oscillating magnetoresistivity concerns the role of the microwave - polarization . here",
    ", the displacement model predicts that the oscillation - amplitude depends on whether the linearly polarized microwave electric field , @xmath9 , is parallel or perpendicular to the @xmath10-electric field , @xmath11.@xcite more specifically,@xcite , the inter - landau level contribution to the photo - current in this theory includes a term with a bessel function whose argument depends upon whether @xmath11 and @xmath9 are parallel or perpendicular to each other , and this bessel - function - argument is a constant for circular polarized or unpolarized radiation for any ratio of @xmath12.@xcite in contrast , the inelastic model suggests insensitivity of the photoconductivity to the polarization orientation of the linearly polarized microwave field.@xcite the radiation - driven electron orbit model indicates a polarization immunity that depends upon the damping factor , @xmath13,- a material- and sample - dependent parameter,- exceeding the microwave angular frequency , @xmath14.@xcite finally , within the non - parabolicity model , the effect of irradiation on @xmath10 transport emerges only for linear- , but not circular,- polarization of the radiation field.@xcite consequently , the radiation induced contribution within this theory depends on the relative orientation between @xmath11 and the linearly polarized @xmath9.@xcite    the polarization aspect has been explored by experiment in ref.@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "measurements carried out on l - shaped specimens have suggested that the period and phase of the radiation induced magnetoresistance oscillations are the same for the @xmath15 and @xmath16 configurations.@xcite ref.@xcite has reported the immunity of microwave - induced magneto - resistance oscillations and zero resistance states to the sense of circular- and linear- polarizations from the experiments carried out on specimens with a square geometry in a quasioptical setup . in a recent study , mani et al .",
    "@xcite reported a strong sensitivity in the amplitude of the radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations to the relative orientation of the linear polarization with respect to the hall bar axis .    here",
    ", we examine the effect of rotating the polarization of linearly polarized microwaves on the radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations in the gaas / algaas 2d electron system.@xcite surprisingly , at low microwave power , @xmath1 , experiments indicate a strong sinusoidal response as @xmath17 vs. the polarization rotation angle , @xmath0 , with the @xmath18 and @xmath19 cases describing the maxima and minima , respectively . at higher @xmath1 ,",
    "the principal resistance minimum exhibits additional extrema vs. @xmath0 .",
    "notably , the phase shift @xmath3 can vary with @xmath4 , @xmath7 , and @xmath5 .",
    "these polarization - dependence studies utilized the novel setup illustrated in fig . 1(a ) .",
    "here , a rotatable mw - antenna introduces microwaves into a @xmath20 mm . diameter circular waveguide . the circular symmetry then allows the rotation of the antenna and the polarization with respect to the stationary sample , see fig .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) .",
    "note that the transverse electric ( te ) mode is excited by the microwave ( mw ) antenna of fig .",
    "1(a ) , and the specimen is subject to the @xmath21 mode of the circular waveguide as shown in fig .",

    "the samples consisted of @xmath22-wide hall bars characterized by n ( 4.2k ) = 2.2@xmath23@xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the long axis of these hall bars were visually aligned parallel to the polarization axis of the mw - antenna for the data exhibited in fig . 1 - 4 , and this defined @xmath27 .",
    "thus , @xmath0 , see fig .",

    "1(c ) represents the polarization rotation angle .",

    "measurements carried out with the mw - antenna ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) connected directly to the analyzer indicated that polarized microwaves were generated by the mw - antenna . in the next step",
    ", the waveguide sample holder was inserted between the polarizer ( mw - antenna ) and the analyzer . here",
    ", the analyzer was fixed at a particular orientation , and the mw - antenna was rotated over @xmath29 .",
    "1(d ) shows the normalized detector response , @xmath30 , at @xmath31 .",

    "@xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "this result shows that , without the sample , the polarization at the sample - location follows expectations , within an experimental uncertainty of approximately @xmath36 .",
    "figure 2 ( a ) shows the dark- and photo - excited- diagonal resistance @xmath2 vs. @xmath7 . here",
    ", the photo - excited measurement was carried out with microwave frequency @xmath37 and microwave power @xmath38 , and the mw - antenna parallel to the hall bar long - axis , i.e. , @xmath39 .",
    "fig 2(a ) shows once again a well - known negative magnetoresistance to @xmath40 tesla in the high mobility specimen in the dark condition.@xcite in fig .",
    "2(a ) , the labels @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , identify the oscillatory extrema that are examined in fig .",
    "2(b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) , respectively . fig .",
    "2(b ) and ( d ) show that the photo - excited @xmath2 ( i.e ,  w/ mw \" ) traces lie above the dark ( i.e. ,  w / o mw \" ) @xmath2 , traces at the resistance maxima for all @xmath0 .",
    "further , the photo - excited @xmath2 at @xmath41 and @xmath43 fits the function @xmath44 , with @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "2(c ) shows that , at the resistance minimum @xmath42 , the w/ mw @xmath2 trace lies below the dark @xmath2 for all @xmath0 as it follows @xmath47 , with @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the greatest radiation - induced @xmath2 oscillatory response occurs here when the antenna is approximately parallel or anti - parallel to the hall bar long - axis.@xcite here , it is worth noting that the period and the phase of the radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations appear not to be influenced by @xmath0 , although the amplitude of the oscillatory response is strongly sensitive to it .",
    "next , we compare experimental results obtained under magnetic field reversal .",

    "2 , the angular response of the extrema can be fit with @xmath58 . however , the fit extracted @xmath3 here differ substantially from zero , well beyond experimental uncertainty .",
    "indeed , a close inspection suggests that the @xmath3 depends upon the magnetic field @xmath7 and its orientation @xmath5 .",
    "for example , we find that @xmath59 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 for @xmath50 .",
    "such a large difference in @xmath3 due to magnetic field reversal is unexpected . here , note that since the mw antenna is far from the magnet , and well isolated from the magnetic field , the magnetic field is not expected to influence the polarization of the microwaves at launch .",
    "further , the stainless steel microwave waveguide is not known to ( and we have also not seen it ) provide a microwave frequency , magnetic field , and magnetic - field - orientation dependent rotation to the microwave polarization .",
    "thus , the @xmath3 shift depending on @xmath7 and @xmath5 looks to be a sample effect .",
    "next , the role of the microwave power in the polarization sensitivity is examined in fig .",

    "4(c ) shows the same at @xmath42 .",
    "note that @xmath65 for @xmath41 here at @xmath66 , which differs from the @xmath45 for @xmath41 observed at @xmath67 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , and @xmath68 for @xmath50 at @xmath31 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . yet , fig .",
    "4(b ) shows that the @xmath3 does not change with the microwave power @xmath1 . at @xmath38 in fig .",
    "4(c ) , @xmath2 exhibits simple sinusoidal variation at the @xmath42 minimum , as in fig . 2 and fig .",
    "however , at @xmath69 , new peaks appear in fig .",
    "4(c ) [ but not in fig . 4(b ) ] , in the vicinity of @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where none were evident in the @xmath72 trace .    the data exhibited above showed that the phase shift , @xmath3 can vary with @xmath4 , @xmath7 , and sign of @xmath7 .",
    "next , we report results obtained on either sides of the hall bar device , and compare @xmath3 obtained by measuring the angular dependence of the @xmath2 .",
    "note that these measurements were carried out on a hall bar device oriented perpendicular to the microwave antenna at the outset .",
    "thus , the starting angle for @xmath2 vs. @xmath0 measurements is @xmath73 ( see fig .",
    "5 ) . at the top of fig . 5 ,",
    "the dark and photoexcited @xmath74 response of the left side of the hall device , @xmath75 [ see fig .",
    "5(a ) ] and the right side of the hall bar device , @xmath76 [ see fig .",
    "5(b ) ] are shown at @xmath77 with @xmath78 and @xmath79 . here",
    ", once again , @xmath79 indicates that the mw - antenna is perpendicular to the long axis of the hall bar .",
    "the @xmath80 vs. @xmath0 traces for @xmath77 and @xmath81 at the first ( p1 ) and second ( p2 ) maxima are shown in fig .",
    "5(c ) and 5(g ) , respectively .",
    "similarly , the @xmath82 vs. @xmath0 traces for @xmath77 and @xmath81 at p1 and p2 are shown in fig .",
    "5(d ) and 5(h ) , respectively .",
    "according to fig .",
    "5(c ) and 5(d ) , @xmath3 for @xmath80 and @xmath82 are @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively , at p1 , and they are @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively , at p2 . also , the @xmath2 vs. @xmath0 at v1 for both sides of the sample [ fig .",
    "5(e ) and 5(f ) ] reveal that @xmath87 for @xmath80 and @xmath88 for @xmath82 .",
    "comparison of the @xmath3 values at different extrema on either sides of the hall bar device indicate that the values are similar for both sides of the device within the experimental uncertainty [ see fig .",
    "the main features in the exhibited results are therefore : ( a ) at low @xmath1 , @xmath89 vs. the linear polarization rotation angle , @xmath0 , with the @xmath18 and @xmath19 cases describing the oscillatory maxima and minima , respectively , see fig . 2 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "( b ) the phase shift in the @xmath90 response , i.e. , @xmath3 , varies with @xmath4 , @xmath7 , and the sign of @xmath7 ( compare figs . 2 , 3 and 4 ) .",
    "yet , @xmath3 appears insensitive to the microwave power ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . ( c ) at higher radiation power ,",
    "the principal resistance minimum exhibits additional extrema vs. @xmath0 [ see fig .",
    "4(c ) ] . point ( a ) demonstrates a strong sensitivity in the radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations to the sense of linear microwave polarization , in qualitative agreement with the radiation driven electron orbit model when @xmath91@xcite",
    ". such sinusoidal variation of the amplitude of the radiation induced magnetoresistance oscillations could also be consistent with the non - parabolicity model ( see fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as already mentioned , the displacement model also suggests a linear polarization sensitivity.@xcite consequently , the polarization angle dependence reported here can be considered to be consistent with the displacement model as well .",
    "yet , the experimental feature that the oscillations do not vanish completely at @xmath92 [ see , for example , fig .",
    "2(b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) ] seems not to rule out the existence of a linear - polarization - immune - term in the radiation - induced transport .",
    "points ( b ) and ( c ) mentioned above are also interesting .",
    "one might also try to understand point ( b ) , for example , in the displacement model . here , polarization sensitivity@xcite is due to the inter - landau level contribution to the photo - current . in these experiments ,",
    "the orientation of @xmath9 is set by the antenna within the uncertainty indicated in fig .",
    "the orientation of @xmath11 is variable and set by the @xmath7-dependent hall angle , @xmath93 , with respect to the hall bar long - axis .",
    "if a particular orientation between @xmath9 and @xmath11 is preferred , say , e.g. @xmath9 @xmath94 @xmath11 or @xmath9 @xmath95 @xmath11 , for realizing large radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations , and the hall angle changes with @xmath7 , then a non - zero @xmath3 and a variation in @xmath3 with @xmath7 might be expected . however , the observed variations in @xmath3 seem much greater than expectations since @xmath96 in this regime .",
    "the change in @xmath3 upon @xmath7-reversal is also unexpected , and this feature identifies a possible reason for the asymmetry in the amplitude of @xmath2 under @xmath7 reversal often observed in such experiments .",
    "consider the typical @xmath2 vs. @xmath7 measurement sweep , which occurs at a fixed @xmath0 .",
    "if peak response occurs at different @xmath3 for the two field directions , then the oscillatory @xmath2 amplitudes would not be the same for positive and negative @xmath7 .",
    "the observed @xmath3 variations seem to suggest an effective microwave polarization rotation in the self - response of the photoexcited hall bar electron device . since @xmath97 , see fig .",
    "3 and 4 , @xmath98 , and the thickness of the 2des lies in the range of tens of nanometers , such a scenario would suggest giant effective polarization rotation in this high mobility 2des .",
    "finally , we reconcile our observations with other reports on this topic.@xcite ref .",
    "@xcite reported circular and linear polarization immunity in the radiation - induced magneto - resistance oscillations .",
    "their measurements were carried out on @xmath99 square shaped specimens , with width - to - length ratio of one.@xcite in such a square shaped specimen with point contacts , the current stream lines are expected to point in different directions over the face of the sample . then , the variable angle between the linear microwave polarization and the local current orientation could possibly serve to produce an effectively polarization averaged measurement , leading to apparent linear polarization immunity .",
    "@xcite examined the interference of magnetointersubband oscillations and the microwave radiation - induced magneto - resistance oscillations , and suggested a polarization immunity in the observed interference effect .",
    "since the effect examined by wiedmann et al.@xcite differs substantially from the conventional radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations , we subscribe to the opinion that there need not be an obvious contradiction that needs to be addressed here . at the same time , we note that some experimental details , such as sample geometry and the method for changing the polarization , are needed to make a further meaningful comparison .",
    "finally , measurements carried out on l - shaped specimens @xcite led to the conclusion that the phase and the period of the microwave - induced magnetoresistance oscillations are independent of the relative orientation of the microwave polarization and the current@xcite , and this observation is consistent with the initial report,@xcite and the results reported here .",
    "in conclusion , experiments identify a strong sinusoidal variation in the diagonal resistance @xmath2 vs. @xmath0 , the polarization rotation angle , at the oscillatory extrema of the microwave radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations.@xcite the results provide new evidence for the linear polarization sensitivity in the amplitude of the radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations .",
