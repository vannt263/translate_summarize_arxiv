    "in different contexts , a number of physical applications involving hairy black holes have emerged in the last years . for instance , asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) black holes endowed with a scalar field have been related to superconductors by means of the gravity / gauge duality @xcite .",
    "additionally , in a totally different area , efforts towards testing the no - hair theorem from astronomical observations have been recently developed @xcite .",
    "the extensive literature about hairy black holes and the broad applications confirm their physical relevance .    such as",
    "three - dimensional gravity has been a fruitful arena for quantum gravity , including the baados , teitelboim , and zanelli ( btz ) black hole @xcite , it also has been very generous in providing exact black holes dressed with a scalar field . after the first examples @xcite characterized by a scalar field which is regular everywhere , other three - dimensional scalar hairy black holes have been reported with emphasis in the microscopic computation of their entropy @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and as the result of an algorithm to determine all stationary circularly symmetric solutions @xcite .",
    "the above results represent only a small part of the considerable attention that the three - dimensional scalar hairy black holes have received in recent years ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) .    in absence of a scalar field ,",
    "the electrically charged btz black hole was introduced in @xcite and the rotating one with an electromagnetic field was presented in @xcite . in both cases the dynamics of the gauge field was defined by the usual maxwell lagrangian , and consequently , the gauge field exhibits a logarithmic dependence on the radial coordinate , as expected in @xmath0 dimensions .    in this article",
    "we consider three - dimensional gravity with negative cosmological constant in the presence of a single real scalar field and an abelian gauge field .",
    "this composite matter source is characterized by the fact that both fields are conformally coupled to gravity , in contrast with some recently proposed models @xcite .",
    "the action for the scalar field contains , in addition to the kinetic term , an interacting term with the curvature and a sixth - power self - interaction potential . with these ingredients ,",
    "this nonminimal action for the scalar field becomes conformal invariant . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that the maxwell action is invariant under conformal transformations of the metric only in four dimensions .",
    "this symmetry is recovered in any spacetime dimension @xmath1 if the maxwell lagrangian is raised to the @xmath2 power @xcite .",
    "therefore , a lagrangian of this form describes the abelian gauge field considered in this work .",
    "remarkably , this conformal invariant action for the gauge field may provide a coulomb - like electric field in arbitrary dimensions .    in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the action and the corresponding field equations , which are solved using a circularly symmetric ansatz and the black hole solutions are identified . since the solutions are given by simple expressions , the search for black holes is greatly simplified .",

    "the temperature , electric potential and entropy are determined .",
    "the entropy is not automatically a positive definite quantity in this nonminimal frame , and additional conditions must be imposed on the integration and self - interacting coupling constants in order to ensure a positive entropy .",
    "finally , the last section contains some concluding remarks and prospects for future work .",

    "it is worth noticing that the negative sign inside the nonlinear electromagnetic term in the action ( [ action ] ) ensures that purely electric configurations remain real .",
    "furthermore , the coupling constant @xmath7 is chosen to be positive is chosen to be @xmath13 just for simplifying numerical factors . ] in order to keep the energy density of the electromagnetic field the @xmath14 component of the energy - momentum tensor in the orthonormal frame positive for this class of configurations",
    ".    since the fields are conformally coupled , their corresponding stress tensors are traceless on - shell , so that einstein s equations ( [ eeq ] ) imply @xmath15 we will deal with asymptotically ads spacetimes . in this context , potentials unbounded from below , for instance the case for @xmath16 in the action ( [ action ] ) , do not generate the sort of instabilities as in asymptotically flat spacetimes , provided the mass of the scalar field is bounded from below by the breitenlohner - freedman one @xmath17 @xcite . in three dimensions , @xmath18 , and because of ( [ r ] ) , in our case the mass of the scalar field is @xmath19 , which satisfies the mentioned bound .",

    "it is clear , from the line element ( [ ds ] ) and the radial dependence of @xmath33 shown in ( [ f ] ) , that these solutions are asymptotically anti - de sitter spacetimes whose asymptotic behaviors match the well - known brown - henneaux conditions @xcite .",

    "[ mc ] , boundary conditions on the matter fields could spoil the conformal invariance of the full configuration .",
    "the case of vanishing scalar field ( @xmath34 ) was studied in @xcite , and we will not consider it here .",

    "since we are interested in the case of nonvanishing scalar field we assume @xmath35 in these equations , which give rise to two different branches : i ) @xmath36 and ii ) @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , it is convenient to address the case without self - interaction potential ( @xmath38 ) in a separate section .",
    "the solution is determined by the metric function @xmath39 the scalar field @xmath40 and the gauge field given by ( [ a ] ) with @xmath41 . moreover , in order to ensure a real @xmath28 it is necessary to fix the coupling constant @xmath42 as one can see from the r.h.s . of ( [ q1 ] ) . in this case",
    ", the spacetime corresponds to a black hole , whose horizon is located at @xmath43 .",
    "it should be noticed that this black hole has the same metric as the static and uncharged btz black hole .",
    "however , it possesses a nonvanishing electric charge and is dressed with a conformal scalar field .",
    "this occurs because the total energy - momentum tensor vanishes , i.e. , the scalar field and gauge field contributions cancel out . therefore , the above solution can be considered as a stealth configuration @xcite produced by two different matter sources .",
    "the metric is free of singularities and the matter fields diverge at the origin , @xmath44 .      first , it is convenient to redefine the coupling constant as @xmath46 , where now @xmath47 plays the role of the coupling constant associated to the self - interaction potential . additionally , we also define @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is an integration constant .    in this way , the solution with a nonvanishing scalar field is given by the metric function @xmath50 the scalar field @xmath51 and the gauge field shown in ( [ a ] ) , with an integration constant @xmath28 satisfying latexmath:[\\[\\label{q }    expression indicates that the gauge field vanishes for two particular values of @xmath49 , which allow to rediscover previous _",

    "hereafter , we focus our attention in new black hole configurations with @xmath56 and a nonvanishing scalar field .",
    "the horizons are located at the positive roots of the cubic equation @xmath57 . by replacing @xmath58 , this problem",
    "is reduced to solve @xmath59 in the case @xmath60 , we are interested in the positive roots of ( [ eqraices ] ) , and for @xmath61 the relevant roots correspond to the negative ones .",
    "since we are dealing with a cubic equation , it is possible to write down their exact roots @xmath62 in the following form @xmath63 with @xmath64 here @xmath65 represent the roots of unity @xmath66 , and @xmath67 are their complex conjugates .",
    "these are @xmath68 for @xmath69 , @xmath70 so that all the roots ( [ roots ] ) are real . in the opposite case @xmath71",

    "note that , for thermodynamic considerations explained in sec .",
    "[ thermo ] , the presence of a horizon is not enough to ensure physically sensible black hole solutions .",
    "the previous analysis indicates that only for @xmath74 there is a positive root , @xmath72 .",
    "moreover , the condition @xmath83 appears by demanding positivity of the r.h.s of ( [ q ] ) .",
    "the intersection of these two inequalities , @xmath74 and @xmath83 , implies that : * ( a ) * there is no restriction for any @xmath84 , or * ( b ) * for a positive self - interacting coupling parameter @xmath47 , it is required to be bounded from above such that @xmath85 , in conjunction with a bounded integration constant @xmath86 .    under the conditions * ( a ) * or * ( b ) * there exists an event horizon located at @xmath87 . additionally , from the analytic expression of @xmath72 it is possible to determine bounds for the event horizon according to the sign of the self - coupling parameter",
    "under the conditions * ( a ) * we have @xmath88 , while * ( b ) * provides the bounds @xmath89 .",
    "since @xmath90 and @xmath26 are positive , the scalar field is regular everywhere .",
    "the gauge field and metric are singular at the origin @xmath44 , as one can read from ( [ a ] ) and from the kretschmann invariant , @xmath91 , respectively .",

    "first , the root @xmath92 can be discarded since it requires the condition @xmath79 and also , from ( [ q ] ) , @xmath93 .",
    "this last requirement is incompatible with the necessary condition @xmath94 to ensure a real scalar field .",
    "therefore , @xmath72 does not produce an event horizon .",
    "second , it is possible to consider the roots @xmath75 and @xmath76 , which become negative real numbers provided @xmath74 and @xmath77 ( conditions labeled by * ( c ) * ) . from the definitions of @xmath75 and @xmath76 one can to extract the following properties : @xmath95 and @xmath96 . then , since @xmath97 the event horizon is located at @xmath98 , provided conditions * ( c ) * are satisfied .",
    "the root @xmath75 gives rise an inner horizon .",
    "since we are considering @xmath47 and @xmath99 , the root @xmath100 can not equal @xmath76 , then an extreme black hole does not occur . due to the inequality @xmath101 ,",
    "the singularity of the scalar field at @xmath102 is hidden by the event horizon @xmath103 . as in the previous case ,",
    "the metric and gauge field are singular only at the origin .",
    "a particularly simple solution is obtained in absence of self - interaction potential .",
    "the metric function @xmath29 reduces to @xmath104 and the gauge and scalar fields are given by ( [ a ] ) and ( [ phi2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "now , the constant @xmath28 satisfies latexmath:[\\[\\label{q3 }    consider @xmath61 , the double zero of @xmath29 at @xmath102 is not suitable to be promoted to event horizon because the scalar field ( [ phi2 ] ) is singular there .",
    "we adopt a conservative point of view saying that the singularity of the scalar field prevents the existence of an extreme black hole .",
    "thus , we consider only the simple root @xmath106 , which becomes an event horizon for @xmath60 .",
    "the condition @xmath93 arises from ( [ q3 ] ) . as in the previous case with @xmath107 , the gauge and metric fields are singular at the origin , and the scalar field is regular everywhere .",

    "we can read directly @xmath135 the minus sign in ( [ dqe1 ] ) comes from the sign difference between the electric field density and the canonical momentum of the gauge field .",
    "the electric charge can be immediately integrated , and is given by the leading term of the canonical momentum of the gauge field : @xmath136 it is clear that the second term in ( [ dm1 ] ) , which takes into account the contribution of the scalar field to the mass , provided @xmath137 and @xmath138 , needs a boundary condition for integrating it , i. e. , a functional relation @xmath139 . in simple words ,",

    "@xmath140 apart from the boundary conditions @xmath141 or @xmath142 , there is only one additional case which also leads a vanishing contribution from scalar field to the mass : the functional relation @xmath143 where @xmath144 is a constant without variation .",
    "these three boundary conditions share a same feature : they do not spoil the conformal invariance of a scalar field approaching to infinity in the form ( [ pa ] ) , as pointed out in @xcite ( for a recent related discussion in four dimensions see @xcite ) . any other functional relation @xmath139 , in the way of designer gravity @xcite , breaks the conformal invariance of the scalar field and consequently , the asymptotic ads symmetry of the whole configuration .",

    "a boundary condition is required in order to determine the mass .",

    "note that the boundary condition ( [ bc ] ) fixes a relation between the integration constants @xmath49 and @xmath26 .",
    "finally , the limit @xmath154 in ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) gives the mass and electric charge of the black hole without self - interaction potential described in section [ l0 ] .",
    "this section is devoted to study thermodynamic properties of the charged hairy black holes shown in sec .",
    "the conjugate variables associated to the conserved charges , mass and electric charge , are the temperature and the electric potential , respectively . the temperature can be obtained by means of the surface gravity @xmath155 @xmath156 which is given by @xmath157 with @xmath158 .",
    "additionally , the electric potential is defined as @xmath159    the entropy can be found using the modified bekenstein - hawking area formula , @xmath160 where the factor @xmath161 comes from the nonminimally coupling term in the action @xcite . since this factor is not positive definite , the entropy could become negative . in order to avoid",
    "such a non - well - behaved thermodynamic situation , solutions in which @xmath162 is negative must be discarded as black holes .",
    "for this reason , it is necessary to impose additional constrains on the integration constants and @xmath47 as discussed in detail below .",
    "we start examining the validity of the first law for the black holes introduced in sec.[bhs ] . using the variation of the global charges and , and the expressions for the temperature ( [ temperature ] ) , entropy ( [ entropy ] ) and electric potential ( [ voltage ] ) , evaluated on each particular black hole , it is possible to prove that the first law of black hole thermodynamics @xmath163 holds in all the cases .",
    "it can be seen as follows . in the general case",
    "@xmath37 the expressions for each member of the above equation are given by @xmath164 after applying repeatedly the following identities which comes from @xmath165 , @xmath166 it is possible to show that the first law is satisfied .",
    "note that this property holds regardless a relation between @xmath49 and @xmath26 , i. e. , the first law is satisfied for any boundary condition . for @xmath36",
    "the check of the first law is straightforward , we have in this case @xmath167 now , we analyze the thermodynamic behavior of the black hole solutions according to the different values of @xmath26 . in the case",
    "@xmath168 , discussed in sec .",
    "[ c0 ] , there exists an event horizon only if the coupling constant @xmath6 is negative .",

    "@xmath172 approaches a linear function of @xmath103 with a slope @xmath173 , which matches the straight line describing the case @xmath36 .",
    "note that for a given temperature , three possible black hole configurations of different sizes can exist.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    for the case @xmath37 , studied in sec .",
    "[ cno0 ] , the expressions for temperature , electric potential , and entropy computed from ( [ temperature ] ) , ( [ entropy ] ) , and ( [ voltage ] ) are @xmath174 respectively .",
    "first , we analyze the temperature behavior .",
    "since @xmath175 , the temperature is a positive , monotonically increasing function of @xmath103 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figtemp ] . for large values of @xmath103 ,",
    "the temperature approaches a linear function of @xmath103 with the same slope , @xmath173 , as for that in the case @xmath36 , which coincides with the temperature of the static btz black hole .",
    "now , we focus the attention on the entropy ( [ ent2 ] ) for @xmath176 . as mentioned , the entropy derived from the action ( [ action ] ) is not a positive definite quantity .",
    "then , the conditions that guarantee black holes with positive entropy must be determined .",
    "this is summarized in table [ tab : tabla ] .",
    ".the table shows the conditions that ensure a positive entropy for @xmath37 . in the first column",
    "the existence conditions for black holes are displayed .",
    "the second and third columns exhibit the range of the coupling parameter @xmath47 and the integration constant @xmath49 for which the entropy is positive . here",
    "we observe that a large negative @xmath47 ensure a well - defined entropy without extra conditions . as is explained in the text",
    ", these conditions also ensure that the mapped solutions , using ( [ conft ] ) , correspond to black holes in the einstein frame . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a conformal transformation maps the action ( [ action ] ) to the einstein frame ( ef ) , where the scalar field is minimally coupled to gravity . the entropy in the einstein frame follows the bekenstein - hawking area law , and hence is a positive definite quantity .",
    "naively , one may think that negative entropy configurations , now mapped into the einstein frame could have a positive entropy .",
    "remarkably , as shown in @xcite , for a similar class of solutions in four dimensions , they are not mapped into black holes but naked singularities in the new frame .",
    "the mechanism acts as follows . in three dimensions",
    "the conformal transformation is given by @xmath178 first , we note the hypersurfaces where the conformal factor @xmath179 vanishes are mapped into curvature singularities of the corresponding image in the ef . for the solutions presented in this work ,",
    "@xmath179 is a monotonously increasing function of @xmath90 approaching @xmath129 for a large @xmath90 , but it is not a positive definite function . for configurations where @xmath180 , the conformal factor necessarily vanishes in a hypersurface located at @xmath181 generating a naked singularity in the ef . on the contrary , for those configurations with @xmath182 ,",
    "the curvature singularity occurs at @xmath183 . only in the latter case",
    "black holes in the conformal frame are mapped into black holes in the ef . in consequence , since @xmath182 is the same condition for ensuring a positive entropy , only black holes having a well - defined entropy in the conformal frame generate black holes in the ef .",
    "therefore one concludes that the conditions for the black holes parameters in the conformal frame , shown in table [ tab : tabla ] ensuring the entropy to be positive , exactly coincide with the ones that guarantee cosmic censorship in einstein frame .",
    "we have obtained exact , circularly symmetric , three - dimensional black holes , which are regular on and outside their event horizons , endowed with conformally coupled scalar and gauge fields .",
    "we remark that all these interactions were fixed ab initio in the action .",
    "the black holes are described by means of very simple expressions , even in the presence of a self - interaction potential compatible with the conformal invariance .",
    "for this reason , their geometries and thermodynamic properties can be easily explored , and consequently , the physical meaning of them becomes clear .",
    "in general , the integration of the field equations provides two arbitrary constants which parametrize the solutions in conjunction with the self - interaction coupling constant .",
    "the black holes can be classified in three groups .",
    "the first group , discussed in sec .",
    "[ c0 ] , includes those with a stealth composite matter source , where the contributions of both fields to the energy - momentum tensor cancel out . the case in which the three parameters do not vanish defines the second group treated in sec .",
    "[ cno0 ] . here",
    "two black holes appear , one with a single horizon , and another one having an inner horizon , which can not become extreme , keeping a nontrivial scalar field .",
    "the third group is defined by the absence of the self - interaction potential ( sec .",
    "this class contains the electrically charged version of the black hole found in @xcite .",
    "additionally , an extreme black hole emerges if the condition of regularity for the fields at the horizon is removed .",
    "it is worth noting that the asymptotic behavior of the metrics satisfies the brown - henneaux asymptotic conditions even in the case of a nontrivial scalar and gauge fields .",
    "this means that these are asymptotically ads spacetimes .",
    "however , the _ entire _ configuration is endowed with the asymptotic ads invariance only if the scalar field allows it .",
    "the conserved charges , mass and the electric charge , were determined under the regge - teitelboim approach .",
    "it was found that boundary conditions on the leading and subleading terms of the asymptotic form of the scalar field are necessary in order to obtain the mass .",
    "this fact is in accordance with the physical statement which says that the mass is well defined after boundary conditions are imposed .    remarkably , the scalar fields presented in sections [ cno0 ] and [ l0 ] have an asymptotic behavior allowing to analyze a wide class of boundary conditions , even including those that break the asymptotic ads symmetry .",
    "this is possible because the scalar field contains two independent integration constants unlike other exact solutions as far we know , which are defined with only one integration constant and hence no other boundary condition is required .",
    "these black holes could be considered in the context of the so - called designer gravity theories @xcite , in which general boundary conditions were numerically studied . however , since the black holes shown here are exact solutions , these could be very useful for those models .",
    "the temperature of the black holes is a monotonically increasing function of the horizon radius @xmath103 , which approaches the linear one for large @xmath103 as it happens in general for the ads black holes . on the other hand ,",
    "the factor appearing in the modified entropy area law is not necessarily positive definite .",
    "hence the positiveness of the entropy requires extra conditions on the integration constants and the coupling parameter @xmath47 as shown in table [ tab : tabla ] .",
    "we note that for a large enough negative coupling constant the entropy is positive without other conditions apart of those necessary for the existence of black holes .",
    "since in the einstein frame the entropy is a positive definite quantity , one may think that negative entropy configurations could have a well - defined thermodynamic description in that frame as well . however , this class of solutions is mapped to naked singularities in the einstein frame .",
    "it is worth pointing out the exact correspondence between the positiveness of the entropy in the conformal frame and the cosmic censorship principle in the einstein frame .",
    "the black holes in the einstein frame , and their geometrical and thermodynamic properties deserve further attention and they are interesting enough as to be considered in a future work . finally , in three dimensions adding angular momentum is not a difficult task , and it would be interesting to study the spinning versions of the black holes introduced here .",
