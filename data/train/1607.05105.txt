    "<S> the current mainly depends on the tunneling from source valence band ( vb ) to channel conduction band ( cb ) and is determined by properties of source - channel interface . </S>",

    "<S> fig03_new](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> both the prominent band bending and the smaller band gap in bp he - tfets result in smaller tunneling height and narrower tunneling width from source vb to channel cb . </S>",
    "<S> hence , current is greatly increased as demonstrated in fig . [ fig03_new](b ) . at @xmath24 , </S>",
    "<S> the current is contributed by direct tunneling from source vb to drain cb . </S>",

    "<S> bp tfets in zd show more prominent layer dependent transfer characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> as the bp thickness changes from monolayer to bilayer , @xmath7 is increased by over ten orders of magnitude at all studied gate voltages . </S>",
    "<S> bp tfets show orientation dependent transport properties , and @xmath7 of ho - tfets in zd is smaller than that in ad by orders of magnitude for heavier carrier effective masses in zd@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> compared with 1l bp ho - tfets in zd , 2l-1l zd bp he - tfets have larger on - state current and maintain low off - state current . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , ss of bp he - tfets in zd is effectively decreased and can reach 40 mv / decade .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that even though current at high positive gate voltages is improved in zd he - tfets , the on - state current is still smaller than that of 2l bp ho - tfets by several orders . in order to further optimize device characteristics 2l bp </S>",

    "<S> the reason is that the extended 2l bp under the gate reduces both the tunneling barrier height and tunneling width , and source - channel junction in the he - tfets at high gate voltages is the same as that in 2l zd bp ho - tfets as shown in fig . </S>",
