    "physicists were fascinated about magnetic monopoles since its ingenious idea was put forward by dirac @xcite and also by saha @xcite .",
    "so many attempts @xcite were made for the experimental verification of conclusive existence of magnetic monopoles and after the failure of attempts , the literature @xcite turned partially negative casting doubts on the existence of such particles .",
    "the work of the schwinger @xcite was the first exception to the argument against the existence of monopoles .",
    "at the same time so many paradoxes were related to the theory of pure abelian monopoles , as dirac s veto , wrong spin - statistics connection @xcite and many others @xcite .",
    "several problems were soon resolved by the invention of dyons @xcite particles carrying simultaneous existence of electric and magnetic charges .",
    "fresh interest in this subject was enhanced by the idea given by thooft @xcite and polyakov @xcite showing that monopoles are the intrinsic parts of grand unified theories .",
    "the dirac monopole is an elementary particle but the thooft - polyakov monopole @xcite is a complicated extended object having a definite mass and finite size inside of which massive fields play a role in providing a smooth structure and outside it they vanish rapidly leaving the field configuration identical to abelian dirac monopole .",
    "julia and zee @xcite have extended the idea of t hooft @xcite and polyakov @xcite to construct the classical solutions for non - abelian dyon . on the other hand ,",
    "prasad and sommerfield @xcite have derived the analytic stable solutions for the non - abelian monopoles and dyons of finite mass by keeping the symmetry of vacuum broken but letting the self - interaction of higgs field approaching zero .",
    "such solutions , satisfying bogomolnys condition @xcite are described as bogomolny - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) monopoles .",
    "kranchenko and coauthors @xcite discussed the maxwell s equations in homogenous media and developed @xcite the quaternionic reformulation of the time - dependent maxwell s equations along with the classical solution of a moving source i.e. electron .",
    "they have also demonstrated @xcite the elctromagnetic fields in chiral media along with their quaternionic reformulation in a simple and consistent manner .",
    "recently , we have extended the work of kranchenko @xcite and reformulated @xcite the maxwell s -dirac equation in homogenous ( isotropic ) medium and their quaternionic forms in a unique and consistent way @xcite .",
    "we have also described @xcite the time - harmonic maxwell s equations for generalized fields of dyons in a consistent manner . keeping these facts in mind , in this paper ,",
    "we have derived the generalized theory of maxwell s -dirac equation in presence of electric and magnetic charges in chiral and homogenous ( isotropic ) medium .",
    "the quaternion analysis of these time dependent maxwell s equations in presence of electric and magnetic charges are obtained in unique , simpler and consistent manner .",
    "it has been shown that the quantum equations and equation of motion represent the dynamics of electric charge similar to the theory described by kranchenko @xcite in the absence of magnetic monopole or vice versa .",
    "considering the existence of magnetic monopoles , dirac @xcite generalized the maxwell s field equations in homogenous ( isotropic ) medium in the following manner @xcite ;    @xmath2    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively the electric and magnetic charge densities while @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the corresponding current densities , @xmath7 is electric induction vector , @xmath8 is electric field , @xmath9 is magnetic field and@xmath10 and @xmath11 are defined respectively as relative permitivity and permeability in electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the electric and magnetic fields of dyons are expresed in homogenous medium in terms of two potentials as ,    @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the two four - potentials associated with electric and magnetic charges .",
    "let us define the complex vector field @xmath15 in the following form    @xmath16    equations ( [ eq:2],[eq:3 ] ) and ( [ eq:4 ] ) establish the following relation between generalized field vector and the components of generalized four - potential as ,    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the generalised four - potential of dyons in homogenous medium and is defined as    @xmath19    i.e. @xmath20 and    @xmath21    maxwell s field equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) may then be written in terms of generalized field",
    "@xmath15as    @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 the generalized charge and current source densities of dyons in homogenous medium given by    @xmath25    using equation ( [ eq:9 ] ) we introduce a new parameter@xmath26 ( i.e. the field current ) as    @xmath27    where @xmath28is the dalembertian operator .    in terms of components of complex potential",
    "the maxell s -dirac equations are written as    @xmath29    we may thus write the tensorial form of generalized maxwell s -dirac equations of dyons in homogenous medium as    @xmath30    defining generalized field tensor of dyon as    @xmath31    which yields the following covariant form of generalized field equation of dyon in homogenous ( isotropic ) medium i.e.    @xmath32",
    "a quaternion is defined as    @xmath33    where @xmath34are real numbers and called the components of the quaternion @xmath35 and the quaternion units @xmath36 satisfy the following multiplication rules ;    @xmath37    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( @xmath40= 1,2,3 and @xmath41 ) are respectively the kronecker delta and three - index levi - civita symbol . for any quaternion , there exists a quaternion conjugate    @xmath42    quaternion conjugate is an automorphism of ring of quaternion i.e.    @xmath43    the norm of a quaternion is given as    @xmath44    the inverse of a quaternion is also a quaternion    @xmath45    the quaternionic form of differential operator may be defined as @xcite    @xmath46    and its quaternion conjugate as    @xmath47    where @xmath48defining the complex vector wave function of generalized electromagnetic field as @xcite    @xmath49    we can now express the generalized four - potential , four current , electric field and magnetic in quaternionic form as @xcite ;    @xmath50    @xmath51    @xmath52    @xmath53    operating first equation of ( [ eq:26 ] ) to equation ( [ eq:27 ] ) and using equation ( [ eq:21 ] ) , we get    @xmath54    similarly we operate first equation of ( [ eq:26 ] ) to equation ( [ eq:29 ] ) and using equation ( [ eq:21 ] ) , we get    @xmath55    equations ( [ eq:32 ] ) and ( [ eq:33 ] ) are the quaternion forms of field equations associated respectivly with the generalized potential and currents of dyons in homogeneous isotropic medium .",
    "these equations are invariant under quaternion transformations as well as with homogeneous lorentz transformations . instead of four sets of differential equations of fileld equations",
    "we may write only one set of quaternion differential equations in compact , simple and consistent manner . we may reinterpret our results as that the algebra over the field of real numbers corresponds four sets of differential equations given by equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) , the algebra over the field of complex numbers corresponds to two sets of differential equations given by equation ( [ eq:9]-[eq:10 ] ) while the algebra over the field of quaternion variables corresponds only to one set of differential equations given by equation ( [ eq:32 ] ) . as such equations ( [ eq:32 ] ) and ( [ eq:33 ] ) are the quaternion forms of differential equations ( [ eq:9]-[eq:10]and [ eq:13 ] ) and",
    "may be visualzed as the quaternion reformulation of generalized potential and current of dyons in isotropic homogeneous medium in compact , simpler and cosistent manner .",
    "let us consider the generalized maxwell s equations for dyons in homogenous ( isotropic ) medium as    @xmath56    in the above equation we have taken the electric field @xmath8 and magnetic field @xmath9 is time harmonic .",
    "considering electric and magnetic field as under @xcite    @xmath57    here we consider the born - fedorov consistutive equations @xcite ,    @xmath58    where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are premittivity , permeability and chiral parameter respectively .",
    "if the medium is isotropic , the cartesian field components are given by    @xmath61    applying the condition given by ( [ eq:36 ] ) into third and fourth equation of equation ( [ eq:35 ] ) we get ,    @xmath62    if we introduce the following notations    @xmath63    the first and second equation of equation ( [ eq:35 ] ) and equation ( [ eq:38 ] ) reduce to the following differential equations as ,    @xmath64    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is denoted as the wave number .",
    "let us consider the following purely vectorial biquaternionic functions as ,    @xmath67    operating the quaternionic differential operator @xmath68 on equation ( [ eq:41 ] ) , we get    @xmath69    thus the complex quaternionic function @xmath70 satisfies the following equation    @xmath71    by analogy of equation ( [ eq:44 ] ) , we obtain the equation for @xmath72 as ,    @xmath73    on using equation ( [ eq:34 ] ) and equation ( [ eq:40 ] ) , the continuity equation is described in the following manner ,    @xmath74    introducing the notations    @xmath75    and using equations ( [ eq:46 ] ) and ( [ eq:47 ] ) , we may write the differential equations ( [ eq:44 ] ) and ( [ eq:45 ] ) in the folowing forms i.e. ,    @xmath76    in the above equations if we put @xmath77 , we get the quaternionic form of the generalized maxwell s equation of dyons in the absence of chiral medium . in general the wave numbers @xmath78and @xmath79 are different and",
    "physically characterize the propogation of waves of opposing circular polarizations .",
    "in the fore going analysis , the equations ( [ eq:36 ] ) showing the dependence of the electric displacement vector and the magnetic induction vector on the electric and magnetic fields , do not take into account the chirality of the medium .",
    "instead , they depend upon only on the conductivity , electric permittivity and magnetic permeability of the medium .",
    "chirality is described as the asymmetry in the molecular structure where a molecule is chiral if it can not be superimposed onto its mirror image .",
    "presence of chirality results in the rotation of electromagnetic fields and its observable , particular in the microwave range even for the case of a particle consisting electric and magnetic charges ( i.e. a dyon ) .",
    "such experimental observations may be used in physical chemistry to characterize molecular structure .",
    "the present theory of generalized electrodynamics of dyons leads the connection between the mechanical parameters with the chirality and dilectric properties of the brain tissue considered as a bioplasama .",
    "hence the proposal for dyonic bioplasama is being considered .",
    "our theory reduces to the theories described earlier @xcite for the case of elecrtic charge in the absence of magnetic mponopole on dyon and cosequently the theories of pure monopole be described from duality in the absence of electric charge on dyons ."
