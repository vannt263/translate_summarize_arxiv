    "astronomical observations of recent years have answered a number of fundamental questions . a cornerstone in _ revealing the state of the universe _ was the combination of observations at low redshift ( clusters , including the mass - to - light method , baryon fraction , and cluster abundance evolution ) , intermediate redshift ( sne ) , and high redshift ( cmb ) @xcite . on the other hand , many new fundamental questions were raised , e.g. , questions concerning dark matter and dark energy . moreover , many answers depend sensitively on the accuracy of the observations , e.g. , on the accuracy of the curvature which determines whether we live in an _ exactly _ flat universe or a slightly curved one .    concerning the high redshift observations , the temperature fluctuations in the cmb are subject to systematic errors resulting from foreground contamination . in particular near to the galactic plane ,",
    "the cmb maps are highly contaminated by radiation from the milky way .",
    "fortunately , there exist methods to reduce the foreground contamination in the maps @xcite . a growing number of foreground cleaned maps are available @xcite and the reader may ask which of them comes closest to the genuine temperature fluctuations of the cmb . this question is related to the question how reliable the maps are , especially near to the galactic plane . there is no way to decide whether a given pixel of a map displays the correct temperature ( apart from pixels that are really very off in their values ) , because the genuine temperature fluctuations of the cmb are unknown . but taking ensembles of pixels , it is possible to check statistically whether the spatial temperature distribution agrees with statistical isotropy . in this paper",
    "we perform such checks using @xmath0 statistic and a generalisation of it .",
    "the result is that even for the best available cmb map either there is left residual foreground contamination or the angular resolution is significantly reduced . because of this residual foreground contamination",
    ", we extend the definition of the @xmath0 statistic such that the foreground contaminated regions of the sky can be excluded . for further studies , this might open a new chance for the detection of matched circles as a result of the non - trivial topology of the universe .",
    "@xmath0 statistic was initially introduced by @xcite for the search of correlated pairs of circles in the cmb sky , @xmath2 where @xmath3 @xmath4 denotes the cmb temperature fluctuations on two circles 1 and 2 , and @xmath5 is the integration along the two circles of equal radius with relative phase @xmath6 .",
    "we generalise the definition of the @xmath0 statistic to include pixel weights that specify the certainty resp .",
    "uncertainty of the temperature fluctuations .",
    "the new statistic is called @xmath1 statistic . in addition",
    ", we note that the @xmath1 statistic is not restricted to correlations along circles , but can be used along arbitrary curves @xmath7 .",
    "[ def:1 ] let @xmath8 and @xmath9 be curves parametrized by @xmath10 , @xmath11 $ ] , and @xmath12 be positive pixel weights that specify how accurate the cmb temperature fluctuations @xmath13 are known at @xmath14 . using the notation @xmath15 we call @xmath16 @xmath1 statistic",
    ".    we remark that the @xmath1 statistic is invariant if the weights are rescaled , i.e. , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a positive constant . the same is also true if the temperatures are rescaled .",
    "the pixel weights may be expressed by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the signal - to - noise ratio . if a temperature fluctuation is known exactly , the corresponding weight equals 1 . in the other extreme ,",
    "i.e. , when @xmath21 is not known at all , its weight vanishes .",
    "it is allowed to parametrise the curves @xmath22 arbitrarily , but care has to be taken if the ratio between @xmath23 and @xmath24 varies with @xmath10 , because the @xmath1 statistic depends on the parametrization .",
    "we will always choose the parametrization such that @xmath25 allowing us to drop the factors @xmath26 in the definition of the @xmath1 statistic .",
    "if one chooses the curves @xmath8 and @xmath9 to be circles of the same radius and sets all pixel weights equal to 1 , one recovers ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) as a special case of ( [ eq:2.3 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath1 statistic always takes values between @xmath27 , maximal _ anticorrelation _ , and @xmath28 , maximal _",
    "correlation_. in a typical resolution - limited application the @xmath1 statistic has a value distribution that is centred near @xmath29 and has @xmath30 for @xmath31 large , where @xmath31 is the number of _ independent _ pixels @xcite .",
    "@xmath32 is the correlation ratio , @xmath33 where @xmath34 stands for the mean amplitude of the correlated part of the signal , and @xmath35 for the mean amplitude of the total signal including the detector noise , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , we also take angular weights into consideration . in particular , we emphasise that we always remove the dc and the lowest frequency ac components along each curve @xmath22 , cf .   appendix [ app : a ] . especially in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] , we use the angular weights of @xcite .",
    "observing the cmb over the full sky , one is confronted with foreground emission of our own galaxy that strongly contaminates the temperature fluctuations near to the galactic plane .",
    "a quantitative measure of this foreground contamination can be obtained from the @xmath1 statistic by choosing @xmath8 to be a closed path and setting @xmath37 . in the subcase of circles we call this setup _ front - to - front _ circles , because @xmath9 traverses the same circle as @xmath8 , but in the opposite direction .",
    "our working hypothesis is that for almost all points on the sky there are temperature fluctuations in the cmb on all scales and that the cosmological principle holds .",
    "consequently , we do not expect any correlations in the genuine temperature fluctuations , i.e.@xmath38 , apart from the circle - in - the - sky signature in case of a non - trivial topology of the universe .",
    "in other words , the typical temperature fluctuations of the cmb should result in a @xmath1 statistic that is symmetric around @xmath39 . that this expectation indeed holds is shown with front - to - front circles that are far away from the galactic plane , see fig .",

    "[ fig:3.1 ] we see also that the width of the distribution which is related to the sum of @xmath49 decreases monotonically with increasing radius @xmath43 of the circles , apart from statistical fluctuations .",
