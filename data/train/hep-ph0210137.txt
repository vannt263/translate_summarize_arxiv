    "this hints to the possibility that other properties of these intriguing particles might substantially deviate from the predictions of the sm , and is presently motivating vigorous efforts , both on the theoretical and experimental sides , to understand more in depth the detailed properties of neutrinos and of their interactions . in particular , electromagnetic properties of the neutrinos can play important roles in a wide variety of domains such as cosmology @xcite and astrophysics @xcite , and can also provide a viable explanation to the observed depletion of the electron neutrino flux from the sun @xcite .",

    "they are related to the vector and axial vector charge radii @xmath23 and @xmath24 through where @xmath25 is the fourier transform of the full dirac form factor @xmath26 .",
    "the axial vector charge radius can be defined in a completely similar way . ]",
    "@xmath27 in the following , even when @xmath28 we will keep referring to the reduced dirac form factor and to the anapole form factor as the vector and axial vector charge radius .",
    "a long standing controversy about the possibility of consistently defining gauge invariant , physical , and process independent vector and axial vector charge radii @xcite has been recently settled @xcite .",
    "the controversy was related to the general problem of defining improved one - loop born amplitudes in @xmath29 for four fermion processes , like for example @xmath30 .",
    "if one tries to take into account one - loop vertex corrections by defining improved effective couplings , one finds that gauge invariance can not be preserved unless , together with other one - loop contributions , @xmath31 box diagrams are also added to the amplitude .",
    "however , box diagrams connect initial state fermions to the final states , and thus depend on the specific process . due to the absence of a neutrino - photon coupling at the tree - level ,",
    "the problem is even more acute when trying to define the charge radius as a physical , process independent property , intrinsic to neutrinos . in @xcite",
    "it was realized that for neutrino scattering off right handed polarized fermions , the @xmath31 box diagrams are absent to begin with , and thus no ambiguity arises .",
    "this suggested a way to derive a unique decomposition of loop contributions that separately respects gauge invariance , and from which a process independent charge radius could be defined as an intrinsic property of the neutrino .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite it was argued that the so - defined charge radius is a physical observable , namely its value could be extracted , at least in principle , from experiments .    for majorana neutrinos , in the non - diagonal case ( @xmath32 ) and in the limit of cp invariance the electromagnetic interaction",
    "is described by just two form factors @xcite . if the initial and final majorana neutrinos involved in the process have the same cp parity , only @xmath33 and @xmath34 are non vanishing , while if the cp parity is opposite , the electromagnetic interaction is described by @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "finally , in the diagonal majorana case @xmath37 the only surviving form factor is the anapole moment @xmath38 . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "this last result can be inferred from the requirement that the two identical fermions final state in @xmath39 be antisymmetric , and therefore it holds regardless of the assumption of cp invariance .    in the sm",
    "the neutrino electromagnetic form factors have extremely small values @xcite . due to the left - handed nature of the weak interactions , the numerical value of the vector and axial vector charge radius coincide , and for the different @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 flavors they fall within the range @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "limit , and decrease with increasing energies with a logarithmic behavior .",
    "] however , since neutrinos do show properties that are not accounted for by the sm , it could well be that also their electromagnetic interactions deviate substantially from the sm expectations .    in general ,",
    "the strongest limits on the neutrino electromagnetic form factors come from astrophysical and cosmological considerations .",
    "for example the neutrino magnetic moments can be constrained from consideration of stellar energy losses through plasma photon decay @xmath44 @xcite , from the non - observation of anomalous energy loss in the supernova 1987a neutrino burst as would have resulted from the rapid emission of superweakly interacting right handed neutrinos @xcite , and from big bang nucleosynthesis arguments . in this last case , the agreement between the measurements of primordial helium abundance and the standard nucleosynthesis calculations imply that for example spin flipping dirac magnetic moment interactions should be weak enough not to populate right handed neutrinos degrees of freedom at the time when the neutron - to - proton ratio freezes out @xcite .",
    "since the charge radii do not couple neutrinos to on - shell photons , the corresponding interactions are not relevant for stellar evolution arguments .",
    "however , in the dirac case , right handed neutrinos can still be produced through e.g. @xmath45 , and therefore constraints from the supernova 1987a as well as from nucleosynthesis do apply .",
    "they yield respectively @xmath46 @xcite and @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "can not be produced through the charge radius couplings , since the vector and axial vector contributions exactly cancel .",
    "therefore , the quoted limits implicitly assume that , because of new physics contributions , one of the two form factors dominates and no cancellations occur . ]",
    "however , if neutrinos are majorana particles , they do nt have light right - handed partners , and the previous constraints do not apply .",
    "in this case , in particular for the @xmath3 neutrino , an anapole moment corresponding to an interaction even stronger than electroweak could be allowed . in the early universe",
    "such an interaction could keep @xmath48 in thermal equilibrium long enough to experience a substantial reheating from @xmath49 annihilation .",
    "we have investigated to what extent this reheating could affect the universe expansion rate and change the predictions for primordial helium abundance . as we will discuss in section 2 , we have found that even an interaction one order of magnitude stronger than electroweak would hardly affect helium abundance at an observable level .",
    "we conclude that constraints on the majorana neutrino axial charge radius can be obtained only from terrestrial experiments .",
    "the present laboratory limits for the electron neutrino are @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "that differs for a factor of 2 .",
    "] of course in the dirac case these limits apply to the sum @xmath51 as well .",
    "limits for the muon neutrino have been derived from @xmath5 scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "they are about one order of magnitude stronger than for the electron neutrinos , and will be discussed in section 4 . due to the fact that intense @xmath48 beams are not available in laboratories , to date no direct limits on @xmath52 have been reported by experimental collaborations . however , under the assumption that a significant fraction of the neutrinos from the sun converts into @xmath48 , by using the sno and super - kamiokande observations the limit @xmath53 has been derived @xcite .",
    "a limit on the @xmath48 vector charge radius ( dirac case ) was derived by analyzing tristan data on the single photon production process @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the same data can be used to constrain also the anapole moment for a majorana @xmath48 , and therefore we have included tristan measurements in our set of constraints .    in the next section",
    "we will briefly analyze the possibility of deriving constraints on the majorana neutrino axial charge radius from nucleosynthesis . in section 3",
    "we will study the bounds on the tau neutrino charge radius implied by the tristan and lep experimental results . in section 4",
    "we will discuss the constraints on the muon neutrino charge radius from the nutev , charm - ii , ccfr and the bnl e734 experiments .",
    "they result in the following 90% c.l .",
    "limits : @xmath54 for @xmath55 we could not find new experimental results that would imply better constraints than the existing ones @xcite .",
    "we just mention that the bugey nuclear reactor data from the detector module closest to the neutrino source ( 15 meters ) @xcite should imply independent limits of the same order of magnitude than the existing ones .",
    "in this section we study the possible impact on the primordial helium abundance @xmath56 , of an axial charge radius large enough to keep a majorana @xmath48 in thermal contact with the plasma down to temperatures @xmath57mev . in this case the neutrinos would get reheated by @xmath58 annihilation , and this would affect the universe expansion rate . to give an example ,",
    "if one neutrino species is maintained in thermal equilibrium until @xmath58 annihilation is completed ( @xmath59 ) this would affect the expansion as @xmath60 additional neutrinos .",
    "the amount of helium produced in the early universe is determined by the value of the neutron to proton ratio @xmath61 at the time when the @xmath62 and @xmath63 electroweak reactions freeze out .",
    "this occurs approximately at a temperature @xmath64mev @xcite .",
    "apart for the effect of neutron decay , virtually all the surviving neutrons end up in @xmath65 nuclei . assuming no anomalous contributions to the electron neutrino reactions",
    ", the freeze out temperature can only be affected by changes in the universe expansion rate , that is controlled by the number of relativistic degrees of freedom and by their temperature .",
    "if tau neutrinos have only standard interactions , at the time of the freeze out they are completely decoupled from the thermal plasma . however , an anomalous contribution to the process @xmath66 would allow the @xmath48 to share part of the entropy released in @xmath67 annihilation .",
    "the maximum effect is achieved assuming that the new interaction is able to keep the @xmath48 thermalized down to @xmath68 .",
    "the required strength of the new interaction can be estimated by equating the rate for an anomalously fast @xmath66 process @xmath69 to the universe expansion rate @xmath70 . in the previous formulas",
    "@xmath71 is the thermally averaged cross section times relative velocity , @xmath72 is the number density of electrons , @xmath73 is the universe energy density with @xmath74 the number of relativistic degrees of freedom , and @xmath75 is the plank mass . the thermally averaged cross section can be written as @xmath76 where @xmath77 parametrizes the strength of the interaction and is assumed to be sensibly larger than the fermi constant @xmath78 , and @xmath79 has been introduced to allow direct comparison with the sm rate @xmath80@xcite . by setting @xmath81 at @xmath82 , we obtain @xmath83gev@xmath84 . therefore , to keep the @xmath48 thermalized until the ratio @xmath61 freezes out , an interaction about ten times stronger than electroweak is needed",
    "however , even in the presence of such a large interaction , helium abundance would only be mildly affected .",
    "this is because at @xmath85mev @xmath67 annihilation is still not very efficient , and the photon temperature is only slightly above the temperature of thermally decoupled neutrinos : @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "this induces a change in the primordial helium abundance @xmath87 which is below one part in one thousand .",
    "this effect could possibly be at the level of the present theoretical precision @xcite ; however , it is far below the present observational accuracy , for which the errors are of the order of one percent @xcite .",
