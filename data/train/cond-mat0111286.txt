    "the first theoretical prediction of the famous phenomenon known as bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) was made in 1924 and 1925 by bose @xcite and einstein @xcite , respectively . in a system of particles obeying bose - einstein statistics where the total number of particles is conserved",
    ", there should be a temperature below which a finite fraction of all the particles condense into the same one - particle state @xcite .",
    "seventy years later , in a remarkable experiment , anderson et al .",
    "@xcite have cooled magnetically trapped @xmath0rb gas to nanokelvin temperatures , and observed the bec .",
    "this discovery has generated a huge amount of theoretical investigations .",
    "the main feature of the trapped alkali - metal and atomic hydrogen systems ( which obey the bose - einstein statistics ) is that they are dilute , i.e. , the average distance among the atoms is much larger than the range of the interaction .",
    "the crucial parameter defining the condition of diluteness is the gas parameter @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the density of the system and @xmath3 is the s - wave scattering length @xcite .",
    "there are two ways to bring @xmath4 outside the regime of validity of the mean field description .",
    "the first one consists by increasing the density , while the second one consists by changing the effective size of the atoms @xcite . in the present work",
    "we follow the second way .    the characteristic dimension of a harmonic oscillator ( ho ) trap for @xmath0rb is @xmath5 while the scattering length lies in the range @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the bohr radius .",
    "the atomic density in the trap is @xmath8 atoms/@xmath9 giving an inter - atomic distance @xmath10 @xcite . in this case , the effective atomic size is small compared both to the trap size and to the inter - atomic distance ensuring the diluteness of the gas .",
    "however , the effects of inter - particle interactions are of fundamental importance in the study of the bec dilute - gas where the physics should be dominated by two - body collisions described in terms of the s - wave scattering length @xmath3 . in the case of positive @xmath3 ,",
    "it is equivalent to consider a very dilute ( atomic ) system of hard spheres , whose diameter coincides with the scattering length itself @xcite .",
    "the natural starting point for studying the behavior of those systems is the theory of weakly interacting bosons which , for inhomogeneous systems , takes the form of the gross - pitaevskii theory @xcite .",
    "this is a mean - field approach for the order parameter associated with the condensate .",
    "it provides closed and relatively simple equations for describing the relevant phenomena associated with bec @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we avoid to use the gross - pitaevskii s theory and we study the bec in a phenomenological way where the bose - gas is considered as a many body system @xcite .",
    "in particular , we study the ground state of a system of correlated bosonic atoms at zero temperature , trapped by a ho potential .",
    "the key quantity for this effort is the two body density distribution ( tbdd ) @xmath11 , which expresses the joint probability of finding two atoms at the positions @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . in the mean field case ,",
    "the tbdd is the product @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the density distribution ( dd ) of the system .",
    "as the mean field approach fails to incorporate the inter - particle interactions which are necessary for the description of the correlated bose system , we introduce the repulsive interactions through the jastrow correlation function @xcite @xmath16 . in this approximation",
    "the tbdd has the form @xmath17 where the normalization constant @xmath18 ensures that @xmath19 @xcite .    the calculations of the ground state properties of the correlated bose system ( dd , rms radii , momentum distribution ( md ) and kinetic energy ( ke ) )",
    "are made using four different expressions for the correlation function @xmath20 .",
    "two of them are jastrow type gaussian functions similar to those which have been used extensively in nuclear physics @xcite , while , three of them are of hard sphere form and they are more realistic in describing atomic and molecular systems @xcite .",
    "the various expressions of the correlation function have one or two parameters ( the correlation parameter @xmath21 and the hard sphere radius @xmath22 ) . in the case of the jastrow type gaussian function , analytical expression of the one - body density matrix ( obdm )",
    "is derived and is also used for the calculation of the corresponding natural orbitals ( no s ) and natural occupation numbers ( non s ) . finally , we give analytical or approximate expressions for the rms radius and the mean kinetic energy @xmath23 ( in one case ) which depend on the parameters @xmath21 or / and @xmath22 .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the general definitions related to the bose system are considered .",
    "details of the lowest - order cluster expansion and analytical expressions of the dd ( and in one case of the md ) are given in sec .",
    "numerical results are reported and discussed in sec .",
    "iv , while the summary of the present work is given in sec . v.",
    "let @xmath24 be the wave function which describes the inhomogeneous atomic system .",
    "in the case where this system is composed of bosonic atoms at zero temperature , all atoms occupy the same single - particle ground state .",
    "the many body ground state wave function is then a product of @xmath25 identical single particle ground state wave functions .",
    "this ground state wave function is therefore called the condensate wave function or macroscopic wave function and has the form @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the normalized to 1 ground state single particle wave function describing a bosonic atom .",
    "it is worth to indicate that eq .",
    "( [ wf-1 ] ) is valid even when weak interactions are included . in this case",
    "the wave function @xmath24 is still , to a very good approximation , a product of @xmath25 single particle wave functions which are now obtained from the solution of a non - linear schrdinger equation , the well known gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "the density distribution @xmath15 , which can be directly observed in a non - destructive way , is defined as @xcite @xmath28 in the condensation case , where the wave function of the system is given by eq .",
    "( [ wf-1 ] ) , the dd , using relation ( [ obdd-1 ] ) , takes the form @xmath29    the tbdd @xmath30 , which is a key quantity in this work , is defined as @xmath31 which in the condensation case , takes the simple form @xmath32 the tbdd is needed for the evaluation of the two - body properties of the atomic system , mainly for the interaction energy .",
    "it gives also direct information about the correlations between the atoms of the system .",
    "this is the reason that the calculation of this quantity is very significant for the study of atomic or in general quantum many body systems .",
    "another quantity characterizing the atomic system is the obdm @xmath33 @xcite which is defined as @xmath34 the knowledge of the obdm is also very important because this quantity is connected to the position and to the momentum space .",
    "the diagonal part of the obdm gives the dd @xmath35 , while the md @xmath36 @xcite is given by a particular fourier transform of it @xmath37   d   { \\bf r}_1    d   { \\bf r}_1 ' . \\label{mom}\\ ] ]    in addition , the obdm may be expanded in terms of its eigenfunctions @xmath38 corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath39 , that is @xmath40 where @xmath41 the eigenfunctions @xmath42 which are called natural orbitals , and the eigenvalues @xmath39 , which are called natural occupation numbers , are obtained by diagonalizing the obdm through the eigenvalue equation @xmath43",
    "the condition , generally adopted , for the existence of condensation is that there should be one eigenvalue @xmath39 which is of the order of the number of the particles in the trap .",
    "the first step for the study of the bec at zero temperature is to neglect the atom - atom interaction . in this case ( named independent particle model ( ipm ) )",

    "it is obvious that for a system of non - interacting bosons in a ho trap the condensate has the gaussian form of average width @xmath47 .",
    "if the atoms are interacting , the shape of the condensate can be changed significantly with respect to the gaussian @xcite .",

    "this equation has the form of a non - linear stationary schrdinger equation , and it has been solved for several types of traps using different numerical methods @xcite .",
    "the presence of the third term , which is linear in @xmath25 is responsible for the dependence of the gas parameter @xmath4 on the density of the system . that dependence is negligible in the case of the ipm . in the phenomenological approach which we consider in this work ,",
    "there is not a direct dependence between the condensation and the number of the atoms .",

    "it is seen that the interatomic correlations in the @xmath137-state spread out the ground state wave function and consequently the condensation is appears in the outer region of the trap .",
    "from the same figure it is obvious that the no s of excited states are much more localized in coordinate space than the equivalent ho orbitals .",
    "the md in case 1 can be calculated analytically from eq .",
    "( [ cluster - nk ] ) or by fourier transform of the no s .",
    "the md calculated analytically for various values of the parameter @xmath93 has been plotted in fig .",
    "it is seen that the large values of @xmath93 ( @xmath116 ) correspond to the gaussian distribution , while when @xmath93 becomes small enough ( @xmath117 ) the md has a sharp maximum for @xmath141 .",
    "the md of the @xmath137-state no as well as of the residual excited states for @xmath120 are shown and compared with the total md in fig .",
    "it is obvious that although the @xmath137-state no gives the main contribution to the md , the no s of the excited state contribute to the md mainly in the large values of the momentum @xmath142 .",
    "the dependence of the mean kinetic energy @xmath91 on the parameters @xmath93 calculated analytically in case 1 , using eq .",
    "( [ kinetic-1 ] ) , is presented in fig .",
    "it is seen that @xmath91 has a maximum for @xmath143 .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the same value of the parameter @xmath93 the non s of the states @xmath139 and @xmath144 have a maximum as can be seen from table 1 .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath137-state no and of all the excited states to @xmath91 are shown in the same figure .",
    "it is seen that , for large values of the parameter @xmath93 ( weak correlations ) the main contribution to @xmath91 comes from the @xmath137-state no , while for large correlations there is a significant contribution coming from the no s of the excited states",
    ".    an approximate expression of @xmath91 , similar to the one of @xmath145 can be found if we expand the expression of @xmath91 , given by eq .",
    "( [ kinetic-1 ] ) , in powers of @xmath126 and truncate the expansion to the @xmath146 power .",
    "the approximate expression has the form @xmath147 the values of @xmath91 calculated from that expression are very close to the ones calculated from eq .",
    "( [ kinetic-1 ] ) for @xmath148 .",
    "a final comment is appropriate .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii equation explains successfully the ground - state properties of the condensate for weakly interacting atoms , i.e. for small correlations between the atoms .",
    "the method of the present work can be used for larger correlations , provided that the expansions of the tbdm and the obdm contain higher order terms .",
    "it should be noted also that , in the present work there is not a direct dependence between the condensation and the number of the atoms .",
    "the inter - particle correlations are incorporated in the mean field only by the correlation function which , in some way , depends on the effective size of the atoms .",
    "however , the condensate fraction can be found by calculating the natural orbitals and the natural occupation numbers by diagonalizing the obdm from eq .",
    "( [ diag - rho ] ) .",
    "these calculations have been made in case 1 , while it is a very difficult task in the other cases .",
    "the effect of the inter - particle correlations between bose atoms at zero temperature is examined using a phenomenological way to incorporate the atomic correlations . that is made by introducing the jastrow correlation function in the tbdd .",
    "we examined the effect of correlations using four different correlation functions .",
    "the introduction of correlations change the shape of the dd and md comparing with the gaussian form , which corresponds to ipm .",
    "there is a reduction of the dd in the central region of the atomic system , and so an increase of the rms radius of the system , while the md , which is calculated in case 1 , increases in the region of small @xmath142 and so there is a decrease of the mean kinetic energy of the system . in case 1 where the mean kinetic energy is calculated also analytically , there is a maximum for a certain value of the correlation parameter . finally in case 1",
    "the natural orbitals and the natural occupation numbers have been calculated and consequently the condensate fraction has been obtained for different values of the parameter @xmath93 .",
