    "quantum walks ( qws ) are attracting increasing attention in many research areas , ranging from solid - state physics to quantum computing @xcite .",
    "in particular , qws provide a model for quantum - mechanical transport processes on discrete structures ; this includes , for instance , the coherent energy transfer of a qubit on an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "the theoretical study of qws is also encouraged by recent experimental implementations able to corroborate theoretical findings @xcite .    as in the classical random walk ,",
    "quantum walks appear in a discrete @xcite as in a continuous - time ( ctqw ) @xcite form ; these forms , however , can not be simply related to each other @xcite .",
    "now , standard ctqws , on which we focus , can be obtained by identifying the hamiltonian of the system with the classical transfer matrix which is , in turn , directly related to the laplacian of the underlying structure .    another feature which ctqws share with classical random walks consists in the strong interplay between the dynamics properties displayed by the walk and the topology of the substrate @xcite .",
    "however , the dependencies turn out to be much more complex in the quantum - mechanical case : while the classical ( simple ) walk eventually loses memory of its starting site , the quantum walk exhibits , even in the asymptotic regime , transition probabilities which depend on the starting site .",
    "for this reason , often the parameters describing the transport are averaged over all initial sites , a procedure which allows a global characterization of the walk , while preserving its most important features .",
    "one of the quantities affected by topology is the mean square displacement of the walker up to time @xmath0 .",
    "classically , this quantity is monotonically increasing and depends ( asymptotically ) on time according to the power law @xmath1 .",
    "the value of the `` diffusion exponent '' @xmath2 allows to distinguish between normal ( @xmath3 ) and anomalous ( @xmath4 ) diffusion @xcite . as for quantum transport",
    ", it is possible to introduce analogous exponents , characterizing the temporal spreading of a wave - packet @xcite .",
    "however , even when they take place over the same structure , quantum and classical walks can exhibit dramatically different behaviours .",
    "in particular , the quantum wave propagation on regular , infinite lattices is ballistic , i.e. the root mean square displacement is linear in time .",
    "such a quadratic speed - up of the mean square displacement is a well known phenomenon when dealing with tight - binding electron waves on periodic lattices @xcite and , from a computational point of view , it constitutes an important feature since it could be advantageously exploited in quantum search algorithms @xcite . in the presence of disorder ( either deterministic or stochastic ) or finiteness ,",
    "the sharp ballistic fronts are softened , a fact which may even lead to the localization of the quantum particle @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of both theoretical and practical interest to highlight how finiteness and inhomogeneity - often unavoidable in real systems - affect the particle s propagation . to this aim",
    "we analyze quantum transport on restricted geometries , where the restrictions arise from the ( possibly joint ) fractal dimension and finite extent of the substrate itself . by direct comparison with the classical case",
    ", we find that , on finite substrates , the advantage of ctqws is at short times only .",
    "moreover , the lack of translational invariance weakens the ctqw performance , i.e. in such situations the average displacement increases more slowly with time .",
    "the finite discrete structures we consider and compare are the dual sierpinski gasket ( dsg ) , the cayley tree ( ct ) _ vide infra _ sec .  [",
    "sec : prob ] , and the square lattice with periodic boundary conditions , i.e. the square torus ( st ) .",
    "these constitute representative topologies , providing examples of fractals with loops , of trees and of regular structures .",
    "the dual sierpinski gasket will be treated in more detail ; for this structure the eigenvalue spectrum of the laplacian matrix is known exactly , allowing for some analytical estimates . indeed , not only random walks , but also many dynamical properties of connected structures themselves ( such as the vibrational structures and the relaxation modes ) depend on the spectrum of their laplacian matrix @xcite . however , for ctqws the set of eigenvectors also matters , which often makes analytical investigations cumbersome .",
    "it is worth underlining that focusing on discrete structures is not only suggested by solid - state applications : quantum computation is traditionally concerned with the manipulation of discrete systems .",
    "in particular , a discrete ( and finite ) state space makes the ctqw simulation by quantum computers , working with discrete registers , feasible @xcite .",
    "our paper is structured as follows .",
    "after a brief summary of the main concepts and of the formul concerning ctqws in sec .",
    "[ sec : ctrw ] , we describe the topology of the dsg in sec .  [",
    "sec : dsg ] .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : prob ] , we study the quantum - mechanical transport over the above mentioned structures , especially focusing on the average displacement and on the long time averages . finally , in sec .  [ sec : concl ] we present our comments and conclusions .",
    "in the appendix we derive analytical results concerning the average chemical displacements of ctqws over hypercubic lattices , special cases being chains and square lattices .",
    "mathematically , a graph is specified by the pair @xmath5 consisting of a nonempty , countable set of points @xmath6 , joined pairwise by a set of links @xmath7 .",
    "the cardinality of @xmath6 provides the number @xmath8 of sites making up the graph , i.e. its volume : @xmath9 . in the following , we focus mainly on finite graphs ( @xmath10 ) and we label each node with a lowercase letter @xmath11 .    from an algebraic point of view",
    ", a graph can be described by its adjacency matrix @xmath12 , whose elements are @xmath13 the connectivity of a node @xmath14 can be calculated as a sum of matrix elements @xmath15 . the laplacian operator is then defined as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the diagonal matrix given by @xmath18 .",
    "the laplacian matrix @xmath19 is symmetric and non - negative definite and it can therefore generate a probability conserving markov process and define a unitary process as well",
    ". otherwise stated , the laplacian operator can work both as a classical transfer operator and as a tight - binding hamiltonian of a quantum transport process @xcite .    indeed ,",
    "the classical continuous - time random walk ( ctrw ) is described by the following master equation @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the conditional probability that the walker is on node @xmath22 when it started from node @xmath23 at time @xmath24 . if the walk is symmetric with a site - independent transmission rate @xmath25 , then the transfer matrix @xmath26 is simply related to the laplacian operator through @xmath27 .",
    "now the ctqw , the quantum - mechanical counterpart of the ctrw , is introduced by identifying the hamiltonian of the system with the classical transfer matrix , @xmath28 @xcite ( in the following we will set @xmath29 ) .",
    "the set of states @xmath30 , representing the walker localized at the node @xmath23 , spans the whole accessible hilbert space and also provides an orthonormal basis set .",
    "therefore , the behaviour of the walker can be described by the transition amplitude @xmath31 from state @xmath32 to state @xmath33 , which obeys the following schrdinger equation : @xmath34 if at the initial time @xmath35 only the state @xmath32 is populated , then the formal solution to eq .",
    "[ eq : schrodinger ] can be written as @xmath36 whose squared magnitude provides the quantum mechanical transition probability @xmath37 . in general , it is convenient to introduce the orthonormal basis @xmath38 $ ] which diagonalizes @xmath26 ( and , clearly , also @xmath39 ) ; the correspondent set of eigenvalues is denoted by @xmath40 . thus , we can write @xmath41    despite the apparent similarity between eq .  [ eq : master_cl ] and [ eq : schrodinger ] , some important differences are worth being recalled .",
    "+ first of all , the imaginary unit makes the time evolution operator @xmath42 unitary , which prevents the quantum mechanical transition probability from having a definite limit as @xmath43 . on the other hand , a particle performing a ctrw is asymptotically equally likely to be found on any site of the structure : the classical @xmath21 admit a stationary distribution which is independent of initial and final sites , @xmath44 .",
    "hence , in order to compare classical long time probabilities with quantum mechanical ones , we rely on the long time average ( lta ) @xcite , defined in sec .",
    "[ ssec : longtime ] .",
    "+ moreover , the normalization conditions for @xmath21 and @xmath31 read @xmath45 , and @xmath46      the average displacement performed by a quantum walker until time @xmath0 allows a straightforward comparison with the classical case ; it is also more directly related to transport properties than the transfer probability @xmath47 : it constitutes the expectation value of the distance reached by the particle after a time @xmath0 and its time dependence provides information on how fast the particle propagates over the substrate .    for ctqw ( subscript @xmath48 ) starting at node @xmath23 , we define the _ average ( chemical ) displacement _ @xmath49 performed until time @xmath0 as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the chemical distance between the sites @xmath23 and @xmath22 , i.e. the length of the shortest path connecting @xmath23 and @xmath22",
    ". we can average over all starting points to obtain @xmath52    for fractals or hyperbranched structures it is more appropriate to use the chemical distance , rather than the euclidean distance ; for instance , the infinite ct ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : prob ] ) can not be embedded in any lattice of finite dimension . for classical diffusion , it is well - known that the chemical and the euclidean distances display analogous asymptotic laws for regular structures and for many deterministic fractals ( e.g. the sierpinski gasket ) @xcite ; as discussed in the appendix , this still holds for ctqws on arbitrary @xmath53-dimensional hypercubic lattices .    for classical ( subscript @xmath54 ) regular diffusion ( on infinite lattices ) the average displacement @xmath55 depends on time @xmath0 according to @xmath56 more generally , for scaling ( fractal ) structures we can define the so - called chemical diffusion exponent @xmath57 and get @xcite : @xmath58 finite systems require corrections to these laws : for them @xmath55 does not grow indefinitely , but it saturates to a maximum value @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "as it is well known , for a diffusive particle the probability to return to the starting point is topology sensitive , and it can indeed be used to extract information about the underlying structure @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to compare the classical return probability @xmath60 with the quantum mechanical @xmath61 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "one has @xmath62 and @xmath63 in order to get a global information about the likelihood to be ( return or stay ) at the origin , independent of the starting site , we average over all sites of the graph , obtaining @xmath64 and @xmath65    for finite substrates , the classical @xmath66 decays monotonically to the equipartition limit , and it only depends on the eigenvalues of @xmath26 . on the other hand , @xmath67 depends explicitly on the eigenvectors of @xmath39 @xcite . by means of the cauchy - schwarz inequality",
    "we can obtain a lower bound for @xmath67 which does not depend on the eigenvectors @xcite : @xmath68 notice that eqs .",
    "[ eq : p_bar ] and [ eq : pi_bar ] can serve as measures of the efficiency of the transport process performed by ctrw and ctqw , respectively .",
    "in fact , the faster @xmath66 decreases towards its asymptotic value , the more efficient the transport .",
    "analogously , a more rapid decay of the envelope of @xmath67 ( or of @xmath69 ) implies a faster delocalization of the quantum walker over the graph . by the way , we recall that , for a large variety of graphs @xcite , the classical average return probability scales as @xmath70 , while the envelope of @xmath69 , namely @xmath71 being a proper parameter related for fractals to the spectral density .    as can be inferred by comparing eqs .",
    "[ eq : p_bar ] and [ eq : pi_bar ] , for quantum transport processes the degeneracy of the eigenvalues plays an important role , as the differences between eigenvalues determine the temporal behaviour , while for classical transport the long time behaviour is dominated by the smallest eigenvalue . situations in which only a few , highly degenerate eigenvalues are present are related to slow ctqw dynamics , while when all eigenvalues are non - degenerate the transport turns out to be efficient @xcite .",
    "before turning to the dynamics of ctqw ( and ctrw ) on exemplary structures , which allow us to highlight the importance of inhomogeneities , some remarks on the spectra of the dsg are in order .",
    "the dual sierpinski gasket is an exactly - decimable fractal which is directly related , through a dual transformation , to the sierpinski gasket ( sg ) . the dsg of generation @xmath72 can be constructed by replacing each small triangle belonging to the sg with a node and by connecting such nodes whenever the relevant triangles share a vertex in the original gasket ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dualtransf ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the number of nodes at any given generation @xmath72 is @xmath73 .",
    "the dual transformation does not conserve the coordination number of the inner nodes ( which decreases from 4 to 3 ) , but it does conserve the fractal dimension @xmath74 and the spectral dimension @xmath75 , which are therefore the same as for the original sierpinski gasket @xmath76 and @xmath77 .    as mentioned above , the knowledge of the eigenvalue spectrum is sufficient for the calculation of several interesting quantities concerning the dynamics of ctqws . in general ,",
    "any ( finite ) hamiltonian @xmath39 can be ( at least numerically ) diagonalized in order to obtain its spectrum .",
    "however , as the size of @xmath39 gets large , the procedure gets to be time consuming and the precise numerical diagonalization may not be easy to perform .",
    "remarkably , the eigenvalue spectrum of the dsg laplacian matrix can be determined at any generation through the following iterative procedure ; for more details we refer to @xcite : at any given generation @xmath72 the spectrum includes the non - degenerate eigenvalue @xmath78 , the eigenvalue @xmath79 with degeneracy @xmath80 and the eigenvalue @xmath81 with degeneracy @xmath82 .",
    "moreover , given the eigenvalue spectrum at generation @xmath83 , each non - vanishing eigenvalue @xmath84 corresponds to two new eigenvalues @xmath85 according to @xmath86 both @xmath87 and @xmath88 inherit the degeneracy of @xmath84 .",
    "the eigenvalue spectra is therefore bounded in @xmath89 $ ] . as explained in @xcite , at any generation @xmath72",
    ", we can calculate the degeneracy of each distinct eigenvalue : apart from @xmath90 whose degeneracy is @xmath91 , there are @xmath92 distinct eigenvalues , each with degeneracy @xmath93 , being @xmath94 , and @xmath92 distinct eigenvalues , each with degeneracy @xmath95 , being @xmath96 . as can be easily verified , the degeneracies sum up to @xmath73 .",
    "finally , notice that the distribution of eigenvalues and their degeneracies are non - uniform and that the spectrum is multifractal @xcite .",
    "results for the exact transition probability distribution @xmath47 for sts and cts have already been given in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that @xmath47 depends significantly on the starting node .",
    "results for ultrametric structures are given in @xcite .",
    "it is worth recalling here that the cayley tree ( ct ) can be built by starting from one node ( root ) connected to @xmath97 nodes , which constitute the first shell .",
    "each node of the first shell is then connected to @xmath98 new nodes , which constitute the second shell and so forth , iteratively .",
    "therefore , the @xmath99-th shell contains @xmath100 nodes which are at a chemical distance @xmath99 from the root .",
    "thus , the ct is a @xmath97-regular loop - free graph .",
    "the numbers of sites in a ct of @xmath99 shells is @xmath101/(z-2)$ ] , hence the correlated fractal dimension @xmath102 goes to infinity for @xmath103 , precluding the possibility of embedding very large ct in any previously specified euclidean lattice . in the following we focus on finite @xmath79-cayley trees , which means that @xmath97 is fixed and equal to three for any internal site of the graph ; furthermore , the number of shells ( also called generation ) is finite ( and therefore also the number of nodes is itself finite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi_apex ] we show our results for a dsg of generation @xmath104 and we focus on the set of pairs given by @xmath105 , where @xmath106 denotes any of the two corners of the gasket of the @xmath107-th generation , with @xmath108 ( i.e. , according to the labeling of fig .",
    "[ fig : pi_apex ] , @xmath109 ) .",
    "now , due to the symmetry the dsg is endowed with , for ctqws starting from a given vertex , say the apex , the left and right corners are equivalent",
    ". as expected , @xmath47 does not converge to any definite value , but it displays oscillations whose amplitudes and average values get smaller as the distance between the sites @xmath91 and @xmath106 increases .",
    "this suggests , at least when starting from a main vertex , that the ctqw stays mainly localized at the origin and its neighbourhood .",
    "we corroborate this by looking at the temporal evolution of @xmath47 for the dsg and by comparing it to the @xmath47 pertaining to the ct and the st of comparable size @xmath8 .",
    "figures [ fig : movie_ds ] , [ fig : movie_d ] and [ fig : movie_q ] show 3d pictures of @xmath47 at different moments @xmath0 ( belonging to the short - time regime ) . on both the @xmath110 and the @xmath111-axis , @xmath22 and @xmath23 label the nodes of the graph in such a way that at the point @xmath112 on the @xmath113 plane the value of @xmath47 is presented . at the initial time",
    "@xmath114 , the transition probability @xmath47 is non - vanishing only on the diagonal , i.e. one has @xmath115 ; at later times , @xmath47 spreads out non - uniformly , according to the topology of the substrate .",
    "in particular , for the dsg ( fig .",
    "[ fig : movie_ds ] ) , a large fraction of @xmath47 stays in a region connected by bonds to the initial nodes ; several peaks can be distinguished , whose heights decrease as the chemical distance between the pertaining sites gets larger . for the ct ,",
    "the pattern representing @xmath47 is even more inhomogenous ; as can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig : movie_d ] , a quantum particle on the ct is located with very high probability on its initial node ( except when starting from the central node ) and , for the time scale considered , it is very unlikely to reach nodes outside its starting branch . on the other hand , for the st ( fig .",
    "[ fig : movie_q ] ) we notice that the spread of @xmath47 is rapid and regular : apart from possibly partial revival phenomena ( see for example the snapshot for @xmath116 ) , the pattern for @xmath47 exhibits very low peaks .",
    "indeed , peaks in @xmath47 are a consequence of the constructive interference stemming from reflections at peripheral sites or ( in the case of the torus ) from the superposition of traveling waves which have crossed the whole ( finite ) graph .",
    "finally , figs .",
    "[ fig : movie_ds ] , [ fig : movie_d ] and [ fig : movie_q ] also highlight the symmetry characterizing the quantum transfer probability , namely that @xmath117 , at all times .",
    "this can be derived directly from eq .",
    "[ eq : formal_solution ] , recalling that @xmath39 is itself symmetric and real .",
    "an analogous symmetry also characterizes the classical distribution @xmath118 for all the cases analyzed here .",
    "the dynamics of quantum particles on non - regular structures has been investigated in several works meant to analyze the quantum dynamics of tight - biding electrons in quasicrystals , in aperiodic and quasi - periodic chains and in random environments @xcite .",
    "there , the highlighted dramatic deviations from the ballistic behaviour ( expected for regular , infinite lattices ) range from anomalous to superdiffusion , to decoherence , and even to anderson localization @xcite .    here",
    ", we consider the case in which non - regularity stems from the intrinsic spatial inhomogeneity of the substrate ( for dsgs and cts ) and we also study quantum walks on sts which allow to evidence the role of finiteness . from the experimental side ,",
    "the importance of such factors ( spatial inhomogeneities and finiteness of the sample ) has been increasingly recognized ( see e.g. @xcite ) , so that it is of great interest to understand to what extent quantum transport is influenced by them .    first of all , we notice that the fact that @xmath47 does not attain a stationary distribution also causes the average displacement @xmath119 not to necessarily increase monotonically with @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , due to reflection effects , we expect the mean value @xmath120 to overestimate the displacement performed by a ctqw that started from a peripheral site .",
    "indeed , one finds for the dsg and the ct that @xmath120 is larger than @xmath121 , @xmath23 being any corner of the gasket ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : r_ds ] ) or any peripheral site , respectively . as for the st ,",
    "@xmath120 trivially equals @xmath49 , for all @xmath23 .",
    "as mentioned above , for classical diffusion the average displacement grows continuously from zero to a maximum value @xmath59 which , due to equipartition , is just the mean distance among sites : @xmath122 despite of the oscillating behaviour of @xmath123 , we can obtain an analogous constant value @xmath124 , around which the average displacement eventually fluctuates , which reads @xmath125 otherwise stated , @xmath120 eventually reaches a `` stationary regime '' in which it fluctuates around a constant value ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : r_av2 ] ) .    of course ,",
    "@xmath124 and @xmath59 depend on both the topology and the size of the substrate , and they diverge as @xmath126 . from the remarks of sec .",
    "[ subsec : tp ] , we expect that quantum interference arising from reflection affects @xmath124 , making it smaller than @xmath59 .",
    "indeed , for the ct and the dsg , fig .",
    "[ fig : r_av2 ] clearly shows that @xmath127 ; this is especially apparent for the ct where @xmath128 ( calculated from eq .",
    "[ eq : r_c ] ) is nearly four times larger than @xmath129 .",
    "conversely , for the st , where interference only stems from the superposition of waves which have crossed the whole substrate , we find that @xmath59 and @xmath124 are eventually comparable .",
    "therefore , we expect that on structures endowed with reflecting boundaries ( i.e. peripheral nodes of low connectivity ) , at sufficiently long times , the expectation value of the average distance reached by a quantum particle is strictly smaller than the average distance @xmath59 among the nodes .",
    "the classical and the quantum cases are further compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : r_av ] which shows the ratio @xmath130 : one can notice that , for significant times ( @xmath131 ) , the classical average displacement is strictly lower than the quantum - mechanical one up to time @xmath132 and @xmath133 for ct , st and dsg , respectively .    thus , we can conclude that , on restricted geometries such as those analyzed here , ctqws can spread faster than their classical counterpart , although the advantage is significant only at relatively short times .",
    "moreover , the spatial homogeneity enhances the speed - up ; especially for cts and , in general , for tree - like structures , the large number of peripheral sites gives rise to localization effects which significantly reduce @xmath124 .",
    "finally , we stress that analytical results on the average displacement performed by a quantum particle on discrete structures are rather sparse ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; in the appendix we prove that on infinite @xmath53-dimensional hypercubic lattices both the average chemical displacement defined in sec .",
    "[ ssec : ad ] and the euclidean displacement depend linearly on time and that this kind of behaviour survives , at short times , also for finite lattices .",
    "the average displacement for ctqws already highlighted some aspects of the role of inhomogeneities for transport processes .",
    "now , we obtain further insights by considering the average return probability",
    ".    for the dsg we can get @xmath66 without numerically diagonalizing @xmath19 , since it only depends on eigenvalues which can be calculated iteratively .    figure [ fig : pi_compare ] displays the averaged probabilities @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath69 - numerically evaluated from eqs .",
    "[ eq : p_bar ] , [ eq : pi_bar ] and [ eq : mu ] , respectively - as a function of time , obtained for @xmath134 .",
    "the classical @xmath66 decays monotonically to the equipartition value @xmath135 , while the quantum - mechanical probabilities eventually oscillate around the value @xmath136 , which is larger than @xmath137 .",
    "although the amplitude of fluctuations exhibited by the lower bound is larger than that of the exact value , the agreement between the two quantities is very good . in particular",
    ", the positions of the extrema practically coincide and the maxima of @xmath67 are well reproduced by the lower bound .",
    "an analogous behaviour was found also for other graphs , such as square lattices @xcite , cayley trees @xcite and stars @xcite .",
    "notice , however , that for the square lattices the lower bound turns out to be exact while for cayley trees and for stars it is only an approximation , which , moreover , turns out to be less accurate than what we find here for the dsg .    on short times ( @xmath138 )",
    "it is possible to construct the envelope of @xmath67 , which depends algebraically on @xmath0 .",
    "the exponent is @xmath139 , to be possibly compared with @xmath140 which is the exponent expected classically for the infinite dsg .",
    "the decay of the average return probability @xmath67 for the st can be estimated as well : its envelope goes like @xmath141 ( classically as @xmath142)@xcite , implying a faster delocalization of the ctqw over the graph .",
    "interestingly , for the dsg , the overall shape of @xmath67 does not depend significantly on the size of the gasket ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pi_g4g5 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the behaviour of @xmath67 is mainly controlled by the most highly degenerate eigenvalues .",
    "these do not change when increasing the fractal size ( i.e. its generation ) .",
    "these values are : @xmath79 with degeneracy @xmath143 , @xmath81 with degeneracy @xmath144 , and @xmath145 with degeneracy @xmath146 , see sec .  [",

    "[ sec : ctrw ] , the unitary time evolution does not allow a definite long - time limit for @xmath47 . then , in order to obtain information about the overall spreading of quantum walks , it is advantageous to use the long time average ( lta ) : @xmath147 where @xmath148 equals @xmath91 for @xmath149 and is zero otherwise .",

    "in particular , the values on the main diagonal are high , meaning that ctqws have a high lta probability to be at the starting node .",
    "the inhomogeneity of the pattern mirrors the lack of translation invariance of the dsg itself .",
    "for instance , @xmath154 being the label assigned to any vertex of the main triangle , @xmath155 is a global maximum ; off - diagonal local maxima correspond to couples of connected nodes belonging to different minor triangles of generation @xmath83 .",
