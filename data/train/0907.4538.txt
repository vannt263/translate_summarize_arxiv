    "calculations based on lattice qcd predict that strongly interacting systems at very high temperature lead to the suppression of heavy quarkonium states due to debye screening of the color charges , providing a potential signature of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation in heavy ion collisions  @xcite . however , this simple picture is complicated by competing effects that either reduce the yield , such as co - mover absorption  @xcite , or enhance it , such as recombination models  @xcite . with the low cross section of the @xmath2 family ,",
    "the roles of absorption and recombination are negligible .",
    "lattice qcd studies of quarkonia spectral functions suggest that while the @xmath9 melts at rhic and the @xmath10 is likely to melt , the @xmath11 is expected to survive  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the production of @xmath2 family in pp , pa , and aa collisions is an important tool to study the qgp properties  @xcite .",
    "star has successfully measured the @xmath2 production in p+p  @xcite and au+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "it is important to study the @xmath2 production in d+au collisions to further understand the initial and final state cold nuclear matter effects . in this article ,",
    "we report the preliminary results of the @xmath2 cross section measurement at midrapidity obtained with the star detector in d+au collision at @xmath12 gev .",
    "the main detectors used in the star @xmath2 measurements are the tpc ( time projection chamber )  @xcite and the bemc ( barrel electro - magnetic calorimeter )  @xcite .",
    "they cover a pseudorapidity range of @xmath13 with full azimuthal acceptance .",
    "the tpc is the tracking detector which measures the particles momenta and energy loss ( @xmath14 ) which provides particle identification .",
    "the bemc includes a total of 4800 towers .",
    "each tower covers approximately @xmath15 in @xmath16 space .",
    "the bemc can be used to trigger on high energy electron pairs thus allowing us to maximize the sampled luminosity provided by rhic . due to the removal of the silicon vertex tracker ( svt ) and silicon strip detector ( ssd ) ,",
    "a significant improvement of the signal to background ratio for non - photonic electrons is achieved .",
    "the star @xmath2 trigger is based on a two - stage decision comprising a level-0 ( l0 ) hardware component and a level-2 ( l2 ) software component .",
    "the l0 trigger will be issued once a high energy bemc tower is measured .",
    "the l0 threshold is set to @xmath17 gev in run8 d+au collisions .",
    "the advantage of triggering at such high energy is the added hadron rejection power @xmath18 of the bemc towers .",
    "the l2 trigger performs tower clustering to reclaim energy leaked into neighboring towers .",
    "the invariant mass is calculated as @xmath19 . where @xmath20 is the opening angle between clusters and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the energy of the clusters .",
    "cuts are applied on @xmath23 gev and @xmath24 gev , @xmath25 and @xmath26 gev/@xmath27 .",
    "for d+au collisions at @xmath12 gev in 2008 , the star @xmath2 trigger sampled @xmath3 nb@xmath4 of integrated luminosity .",
    "the p+p equivalent integrated luminosity is @xmath28 pb@xmath4 , which is more than a factor of 2 larger than the sample analyzed in the preliminary data reported in ref  @xcite of the 2006 pp run .",
    "electrons are identified  @xcite by selecting charged particle tracks , where more than 22 out of 45 points are fitted and whose specific ionization energy loss in the tpc is @xmath29 ( @xmath30 is the normalized de / dx and it is defined by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the expected mean de / dx of electrons and @xmath33 is the de / dx resolution of the tpc ) .",
    "the selected particle tracks have to match to bemc clusters that contain energy consistent with the l0 and l2 trigger conditions .",
    "a cut on @xmath34 is applied to further reject hadrons from the electron candidates , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the particle s energy deposited in bemc and the momentum measured by the tpc , respectively .",
    "the @xmath37 pairs are then combined to produce the invariant mass spectrum .",
    "the combinatorial background is estimated using like - sign pairs .",
    "the like - sign electron pairs are combined to form the invariant mass spectrum and the geometric mean @xmath38 is used to calculate the combinatorial background , where @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) is the number of the positive ( negative ) like - sign electron pairs .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "1 shows the unlike - sign and the like - sign invariant mass spectra .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "1 shows the transverse momentum reach for the unlike - sign and like - sign electron pairs indicating that star has the capability to measure the transverse momentum spectra of the @xmath2 family up to @xmath41 gev/@xmath42 .",
    "signal and background in @xmath12 gev d+au collisions .",
    "the solid symbols with statistical error bars are obtained by combining the unlike - sign ( @xmath37 ) pairs .",
    "the dashed histogram shows the like - sign background .",
    "right panel : the transverse momentum distributions for unlike - sign ( solid line ) and like - sign ( dashed line ) @xmath43 pairs . ]",
    "the total yield is extracted by integrating the invariant mass spectrum from 7 to 11 gev/@xmath27 .",
    "the invariant mass range used for integration is the same as that for the star measurement of p+p  @xcite .",
    "the integrated yield is @xmath44 and the signal significance is @xmath45 .",
    "this is to - date , the strongest signal of @xmath7 states at rhic energies .",
    "the cross section is then calculated with the formula : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the branching ratio fraction for @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the raw yield , @xmath50 is the rapidity interval , @xmath51 nb@xmath4 is the integrated luminosity and @xmath52 is the efficiency for reconstructing @xmath2 family . @xmath53",
    "is the geometrical acceptance , @xmath54 is the l0 and l2 trigger efficiency , @xmath55 is the efficiency of the invariant mass cut , @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the efficiency for single electron reconstruction and the electron identification cuts , respectively .",
    "each term and its uncertainty is estimated through simulations and the total efficiency is found to be @xmath58 .",
    "the cross - section at midrapidity in @xmath12 gev d+au collisions is found to be @xmath5 nb .",
    "the contribution to the di - electron yield in the @xmath2 mass region coming from drell - yan and @xmath59 is estimated to be @xmath6010@xmath61 based on  @xcite and pythia .",
    "the detailed systematic uncertainty is under study .",
    "we compare our midrapidity measurement with nlo ( next - to - leading - order ) calculations the color evaporation model ( cem )  @xcite in fig .",
    "the calculation includes the anti - shadowing effect which is obtained from the eks98 parameterization  @xcite .",
    "it does nt include absorption effect .",
    "we also calculate the nuclear modification factor @xmath6 .",
    "the cross section in p+p collisions is taken from star measurement  @xcite .     at midrapidity .",
    "the bar indicates the statistical error and the band shows the systematic uncertainty .",
    "the cross section is compared with the nlo cem model prediction ( blue solid circles ) , see text for details . the raw yields vs. rapidity",
    "is shown by the red histogram at the bottom with the statistical errors . ]",
    "the star experiment made the first measurement of the @xmath62 cross section at midrapidity in d+au collisions at @xmath12 gev . an @xmath63 significant signal is observed and @xmath5 nb . the large acceptance of the detectors and the l0+l2 trigger are essential for the success of the measurement .",
    "the cross section is consistent with cem predictions including anti - shadowing .",
    "it is found that @xmath6 , which suggests the @xmath7 production follows the number of binary collisions scaling in d+au collision . with the current uncertainty of @xmath64",
    "we can not quantify the cold nuclear matter effect .",
    "the uncertainties are dominated by the statistical error of the @xmath2 cross section measurement in p+p collision . in the rhic 2009 p+p run , star has sampled 21 pb@xmath4 of integrated luminosity and that will provide us a precise baseline for @xmath2 measurements .",
