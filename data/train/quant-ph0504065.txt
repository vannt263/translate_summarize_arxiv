    "the supersymmetry in physics has been introduced in the quantum field theory for unifying different interactions in a unique construct @xcite .",
    "supersymmetric formulation of quantum mechanics is due to the problem of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "ideas of supersymmetry have been profitably applied to many nonrelativistic quantum mechanical problems since , and now there are no doubts that the supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susy qm ) has its own right to exist ( for recent developments see a special issue of journal of physics a , vol .",
    "34 , no 43 , 2004 ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that most papers in this field deal with the hermitian hamiltonians .",
    "differential equation of schrdinger - like type with a non - hermitian hamiltonian appears in many physical models .",
    "one can cite quantum systems coupled to the environment like a hydrogen  atom \" in an interacting medium subject to a dissipative force @xcite ( see also @xcite ) or different decay or collision reactions ( see e. g. @xcite ; for more recent developments see @xcite ; in @xcite the method of susy qm is involved ) .",
    "physical needs initiated a deep mathematical study of spectral problems with non - hermitian hamiltonians in 50th and 60th of the previous century .",
    "the most essential result was first obtained by keldysh @xcite who proved the completeness of the set of eigenfunctions and associated functions for a regular sturm - liouville problem with a non - hermitian hamiltonian . in the books by naimark @xcite and marchenko @xcite one can find good reviews of these studies .",
    "a new impact to studying different properties of non - hermitian hamiltonians is due to the discovery that the real character of the spectrum of a non - hermitian hamiltonian may be in particular related with so - called -symmetry @xcite and suggestion to generalize the quantum mechanics by accepting non - hermitian hamiltonians with a real spectrum to describe physical observables @xcite ( see also the review @xcite ) .",
    "the necessary condition for such a generalization consists in the possibility to define a hilbert space with a positive definite metric which is intimately related with the property of a hamiltonian to be diagonalizable ( for recent discussions see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this apparently may be assured in many cases since non - diagonalizable hamiltonians may be transformed into diagonalizable ones by susy transformations @xcite .",
    "the latter property permits us to suppose that the method of susy qm may become an essential ingredient of the complex quantum mechanics .",
    "this conjecture is also supported by established properties of this method not only to offer possibility for obtaining new exactly solvable complex potentials from known ones @xcite but also to help deeper understanding different properties of complex potentials @xcite . in particular , an explicit construction of a superalgebra involving non - hermitian hamiltonians , which may be useful in different contexts i.e. integrability , quantization , different quantum field models etc , is shown to be possible @xcite and even is now developed till the notion of pseudosupersymmetry @xcite and nonlinear pseudosupersymmetry @xcite .",
    "the relation of the general two - level model described by a non - hermitian hamiltonian acting in the two - dimensional hilbert space @xmath2 with the pseudosupersymmetry is discussed by mostafazadeh @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the approach of this author we reduce the time - dependent schrdinger equation for the two level system , interacting in the rotating wave approximation with the electric component of an electromagnetic field , with a hermitian hamiltonian ( see e.g. @xcite ) to the one - dimensional stationary dirac equation with an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian where the time plays the role of the space variable .",
    "if we considered the spectral properties of the latter hamiltonian we would define it in the hilbert space @xmath3 . but as we shall see in our approach the spectral parameter in the dirac equation is not related with spectral properties of the two - level system .",
    "therefore we will not discuss any spectral features of this hamiltonian and in particular its diagonalizability .",
    "of course , the obtained dirac equation is completely equivalent to the initial schrdinger equation and if one studied it by usual means one would not get any new information about the two - level system . from this point of view",
    "the method of susy qm we are using proves its extreme efficiency once again .    to find a pseudosuperpartner for the given dirac - like hamiltonian",
    "we are using the technique of intertwining operators developed in @xcite for the one - dimensional stationary dirac equation .",
    "we have to notice that the application of results of this paper to our particular problem is not straightforward since transformation operators of the general form do not preserve the very peculiar form of the effective dirac hamiltonian corresponding to the two - level system .",
    "so , below we show how from the wide variety of possible transformations one can choose the necessary ones . in our approach",
    "in contrast to @xcite the two pseudosuperpartners and pseudosupersymmetry generators constructed with the help of first order intertwiners close a quadratic pseudosuperalgebra . as it usually happens for the method of intertwining operators @xcite",
    "if one of the two hamiltonians is exactly solvable the same property takes place for the other . in this way",
    "starting from the simplest case corresponding to the famous rabi oscillations we have found new electric fields having time - dependent frequencies for which the equation of motion of the two - level system has exact solutions . while analyzing solutions of the schrdinger equation we have found a new interesting physical phenomenon .",
    "we show that there exists such a time - dependent detuning of the field frequency from the resonance value that the probability to populate the excited level ceases to oscillate and becomes a monotonically growing function of time tending to @xmath0 .",
    "of course this is a strictly fixed excitation regime similar to resonance .",
    "we also study how the above probability behaves under small deviations from this specific regime .",
    "we have found that when the parameters of the model are close enough to the specific values the probability exhibits two kinds of oscillations .",
    "the oscillations with a small amplitude and a frequency close to the rabi frequency ( fast oscillations ) take place at the background of the ones with a big amplitude and a small frequency ( slow oscillations ) . during the period of slow oscillations , which grows when the parameters of the model approach the above specific values",
    ", the minimal value of the probability to populate the excited level may exceed @xmath1 suggesting for an ensemble of such two - level atoms the possibility to acquire the inverse population and exhibit lasing properties .",
    "we have to notice that some of the results we expose below are known from the previous paper @xcite . these authors also use a similar intertwining technique but they do not relate it with the pseudosupersymmetry and do not give any analysis of solutions this method can provide with .",
    "moreover , we give a deeper analysis of restrictions imposed on transformation operators by the features of the two - level system .",
    "in particular , we show that both the new hamiltonian and solutions of the new dirac equation can be expressed in terms of a real - valued function which is a solution of a second order differential equation with real coefficients .",
    "since such equations have real solutions always our analysis opens the direct possibility to realize chains of transformations preserving the form of the dirac - like hamiltonian imposed by the features of the two - level system .",
    "the two - level model in the rotating wave approximation with a possibly time - dependent detuning is described by the following system of equations ( see e.g. @xcite ) : [ asist1 ] ia_1-fa_1=a_2 ia_2+fa_2=a_1 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the matrix element of the dipole interaction operator , @xmath6 is the amplitude of the electric component of an external electromagnetic field ; @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are energy levels of the free atom and @xmath12 is the field frequency ; the dot over the symbol means the derivative with respect to time . while normalized properly the functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 give occupation probabilities for the ground and excited states respectively .",
    "if @xmath15 does not depend on time ( hence @xmath16 ) solutions of the system ( [ asist1 ] ) are well - known .",
    "for instance , with the initial condition @xmath17 and @xmath18 at @xmath19 we get the well - known formula @xcite for the excited state occupation probability if initially the system is in the ground state [ c2 ] p(t)=    frequency .",
    "the probability ( [ c2 ] ) is an oscillating function of time ( so called rabi oscillations ) . at the resonance ( @xmath20 )",
    "it oscillates with the rabi frequency .",
    "therefore the value @xmath21 characterizes the detuning of @xmath12 from its resonance value equal @xmath22 . in section 5 using the formalism developed in section 4 we shall get time - dependent functions @xmath23 ( and hence @xmath21 ) for which system ( [ asist1 ] ) permits exact solutions . as we show below ( section 5 ) time - dependent corrections to the detuning that we will consider although may change crucially the time - dependent behavior of the solutions of system ( [ asist1 ] ) but they essentially keep oscillating character of the probability to populate the excited level with the frequency close to @xmath24 . yet , the absence of the rabi oscillations may be considered as oscillations with the same frequency but with the zero amplitude since they may be obtained as corresponding limiting case of oscillations with a non - zero amplitude .",
    "so , in our approach the rotating wave approximation is as good as it is in the classical case of the electric field of a constant frequency .",
    "let us rewrite system ( [ asist1 ] ) in the matrix form [ ms ] h_0=eh_0=_t+v_0 where [ v0 ] v_0= i f_0_y @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ( the superscript  @xmath28 \" denotes the transposition ) and we replaced @xmath29 ( which we will call the  potential \" ) in ( [ asist1 ] ) by @xmath30 ; @xmath31 denote the standard pauli matrices .",
    "equation ( [ ms ] ) is the one - dimensional stationary dirac equation with the non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath32 defined by the potential ( [ v0 ] ) where @xmath33 plays the role of the space variable . by construction the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath34 are real . for a fixed value of the dipole momentum of the irradiated system",
    "the parameter @xmath26 is defined by the amplitude of the electric field and , hence , is not related with spectral properties of the system .",
    "a useful comment is that since the hamiltonian of the system ( [ asist1 ] ) is hermitian , @xmath35 , the evolution of the two - level system is unitary even for a time - dependent function @xmath23 .",
    "this means that the @xmath2 inner product , @xmath36 , for the dirac equation ( [ ms ] ) is @xmath33-independent .",
    "let us have a non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath32",
    ". we will not consider it as a hamiltonian acting in a hilbert space but to construct a susy algebra we need adjoint operators which we will introduce in a formal way .",
    "denote by @xmath37 the operator formally adjoint to @xmath32 .",
    "as usual the adjoint operation consists in taking the complex conjugation and transposition , the operator of the first derivative is skew - hermitian and @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath39 be a  transformed hamiltonian \" which should be found together with the transformation operator @xmath40 by solving the intertwining relation @xmath41 and @xmath42 be its adjoint .",
    "the later participates in the adjoint intertwining relation @xmath43 .",
    "it means that the operator @xmath44 transforms eigenfunctions of @xmath42 into eigenfunctions of @xmath37 .",
    "let us suppose that there exists an operator @xmath45 such that @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 ( in general both signs may be accepted ) . then from the adjoint intertwining relation it follows that @xmath49 meaning that the operator @xmath50 realizes the backward transformation from @xmath39 to @xmath32 and the operator @xmath51 transforms from @xmath37 to @xmath42 . from here",
    "we infer that the superposition @xmath52 transforms solutions of the equation ( [ ms ] ) into solutions of the same equation meaning that this is a symmetry operator for this equation . in the simplest case",
    "when @xmath40 is a differential operator that we would like to consider this symmetry operator may be a function of @xmath32 , so we will suppose that @xmath53 . by the same reason the superposition @xmath54 may be a function of @xmath39 leading to @xmath55 .",
    "moreover , we will also suppose that @xmath56 is an analytic function .",
    "these properties generalize the known factorization ( polynomial factorization if @xmath57 is a polynomial , see e.g. @xcite ) properties taking place for the hermitian case .",
    "it follows from ( [ ms ] ) and ( [ v0 ] ) that in our case @xmath58 .    keeping in mind the properties of the operators @xmath40 and @xmath45 let us introduce the following matrix operators : h= (    cc h_0 & 0 + 0 & h_1    ) q_1= (    cc 0 & 0 + l & 0    ) q_2= (    cc 0 & jl^+j + 0 & 0    ) .",
    "it follows from the intertwining relations that the operators @xmath59 and @xmath60 commute with @xmath61 and they apparently are nilpotent .",
    "the above factorization properties are equivalent to the following anticommutation relation : @xmath62 .",
    "now if we identify our @xmath45 operator with @xmath63 introduced in @xcite , @xmath64 , our @xmath40 operator with @xmath65 and @xmath50 with @xmath66 , we conclude that the operator @xmath60 becomes pseudoadjoint to @xmath59 , the operators @xmath61,@xmath59 and @xmath60 close a nonlinear superalgebra and one can associate a nonlinear pseudosupersymmetry with quantum system described by the hamiltonian @xmath61 . in the next section",
    "we shall show that a quadratic pseudosupersymmetry may be associated with the two - level system .",
    "to be able to associate a pseudosupersymmetry with the hamiltonian given in ( [ ms ] ) and ( [ v0 ] ) we have to find an intertwining operator and a partner hamiltonian @xmath39 . according to ref .",
    "@xcite the intertwining operator @xmath40 for a matrix equation such as ( [ ms ] ) is defined with the help of a matrix - valued function @xmath67 satisfying the equation [ u ] h_0==(_1,_2 ) called the  transformation function \" , as follows : [ l ] l=_t - w w=^-1 . here",
    "@xmath68 and @xmath69 are arbitrary constants .",

    "@xmath73 marks quantities before the transformation and @xmath74 marks these after the transformation .",
    "it is not difficult to see that to preserve the form ( [ v0 ] ) of the potential so that @xmath75 it is sufficient to take the transformation function of the form [ cu ] =(    cc u_11 & u_11 + u_21 & -u_21    ) . in this case",
    "the column - vector @xmath76 is a solution to the initial equation ( [ ms ] ) corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath77 and the column - vector @xmath78 is a solution to the same equation with the eigenvalue @xmath79 ( note that this symmetry is built into the system ( [ ms ] ) ! ) so that @xmath80 in ( [ u ] ) has the form @xmath81 .",
    "after some simple algebra one finds from ( [ v1 ] ) that @xmath82 where [ df ] f =  ( - ) -2f_0 .    in general , solutions @xmath83 of equation ( [ ms ] ) from which the matrix @xmath84 is composed , @xmath85 , are complex , leading to a complex - valued potential difference @xmath86 . for physical reasons we require real potentials",
    "a necessary condition for @xmath86 to be real is that the eigenvalue @xmath77 be purely imaginary .",
    "indeed , it is easy to show that @xmath77 can not be real . according to ( [ df ] )",
    "@xmath86 is defined by the expression @xmath87 . putting @xmath88 one",

    "finally one can prove that @xmath90 is real ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    now when the imaginary character of @xmath77 is established we see from ( [ df ] ) that the left hand side of ( [ u1121 ] ) must be purely imaginary , which is possible only if @xmath91 , meaning that @xmath92 and @xmath93 have the same absolute value .",

    "one eliminates the first derivative term from ( [ qe ] ) thus obtaining [ psieq ] + = 0 .",

    "<S> using the intertwining relation we construct a pseudosuperpartner for a ( non - hermitian ) dirac - like hamiltonian describing a two - level system interacting in the rotating wave approximation with the electric component of an electromagnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the two pseudosuperpartners and pseudosupersymmetry generators close a quadratic pseudosuperalgebra . a class of time dependent electric fields for which the equation of motion for a two level system placed in this field can be solved exactly is obtained . new interesting phenomenon is observed . </S>",
    "<S> there exists such a time - dependent detuning of the field frequency from the resonance value that the probability to populate the excited level ceases to oscillate and becomes a monotonically growing function of time tending to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that near this fixed excitation regime the probability exhibits two kinds of oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillations with a small amplitude and a frequency close to the rabi frequency ( fast oscillations ) take place at the background of the ones with a big amplitude and a small frequency ( slow oscillations ) . during the period of slow oscillations the minimal value of the probability to populate the excited level </S>",
