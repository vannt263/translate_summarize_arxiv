    "an electromagnetic mode of frequency @xmath0 within an electromagnetic cavity is analogous to a harmonic oscillator with a quantized energy spectrum given by semi - integer multiples @xmath1 of the energy quantum @xmath2 , where the integer @xmath3 is the occupation number of the mode , i.e. , the number of photons in the corresponding state , @xmath2 is the quantized energy of each photon and @xmath4 is the ground state energy arising from the quantum nature of the electromagnetic field and its _ zero point fluctuations_. as the frequency of the electromagnetic modes depends on the geometry of the cavity , the zero point fluctuations may not be simply disregarded as a constant contribution to the energy and should be accounted for in calculations of the total energy of the system .",
    "a simple vacuum cavity may be produced by positioning two flat conducting plates parallel to each other a small distance @xmath5 apart , leading to a first quantization of the electromagnetic field within the cavity . in 1948",
    ", casimir @xcite predicted that the vacuum electromagnetic energy due to the quantum fluctuations of the field would depend on @xmath5 and therefore a force , which turns out to be attractive , would act on each plate .",
    "this casimir force also may be conceived as originated from the difference between the radiation pressure due to the fluctuating electromagnetic modes outside the plates and the modes within @xcite .",
    "irrespective of its interpretation , the casimir force has its origin in the linear momentum carried by the radiation field .",
    "nevertheless , the radiation field carries angular momentum beyond linear momentum . therefore ,",
    "if the plates are optically anisotropic , a casimir torque might develop besides the casimir force .",
    "in fact , the transfer of angular momentum of polarized light to a macroscopic birefringent medium , resulting in a torque , has been known for a long time @xcite .",
    "the casimir torque may be interpreted as arising from the orientational dependence of the vacuum electromagnetic energy , specifically from the dependence on the relative orientation of the optical axes of the plates .",
    "the resultant torque tends to align the optical axes along the configuration that minimizes the vacuum energy .",
    "recently , the casimir effect has received considerable attention for its possible technological applications , besides the fact that experimental studies have attained the necessary accuracy to test in detail the theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "therefore , theories about the casimir effect that account realistically for the properties of actual materials have become indispensable .",
    "the study of vacuum forces between real materials was pioneered by lifshitz @xcite , who considered two semi - infinite homogeneous and isotropic non - spatially dispersive dielectric slabs , whose fluctuating currents were the sources of the fluctuating electromagnetic field and whose correlations were related to the dielectric response of the materials .    in 1972 ,",
    "parsegian and weiss derived an expression in the non - retarded limit for the interaction energy between two semi - infinite dissipationless dielectric anisotropic materials @xcite following a method of surface mode summation .",
    "barash derived an expression which included retardation and dissipation effects @xcite employing an auxiliary system @xcite first introduced for isotropic systems .",
    "the solutions of maxwell s equations for the field in inhomogeneous and absorbing media were expanded in terms of the orthogonal solutions of maxwell s equations for a non - dissipative auxiliary system in which the frequency dependence of the dielectric function is only parametric .",
    "the use of an auxiliary system was further developed in physical terms by kupiszewska @xcite in a calculation of casimir forces for lossy and dispersive isotropic dielectrics in the case of one dimensional propagation of electromagnetic waves .",
    "the problem of quantizing a dissipative system is attacked by accounting both for the dynamics of the vacuum modes and of the atomic dipoles to which they couple and which make up the material , together with a thermal reservoir in which the atomic radiators dissipate the absorbed energy . that formalism was extended by van enk @xcite to obtain the torque between anisotropic materials in the 1d case . in his work ,",
    "van enk calculated the torque starting from the flux of the spin angular momentum of the electromagnetic field .",
    "numerical calculations have also been performed for materials with a small anisotropy using barash s results and it has been shown that the torque may be large enough to be experimentally measurable in several novel experimental configurations @xcite . by a similar technique ,",
    "the casimir energy between anisotropic dielectric plates @xcite , and between a plate with anisotropic magnetic response and another with anisotropic dielectric response @xcite have been calculated and analytical approximate expressions for the torque and force were obtained in the retarded limit .",
    "kenneth and nussinov have also calculated the casimir energy between parallel plates made up of arrays of wires aligned along different directions @xcite using a path integral technique @xcite .    in the works described above , specific models of the dielectric properties of the plates were assumed from the onset in order to derive expressions for the casimir force and torque .",
    "however , recent works @xcite have shown that if the theory is set up in terms of the reflection coefficients of the media , or equivalently , in terms of their exact surface impedance @xcite , it is possible to decouple the calculation of the casimir force from the calculation of the dielectric response of the materials .",
    "lambrecht et al . have extended their scattering approach @xcite to corrugated systems @xcite .",
    "moreover , they have argued that the resulting formula for the casimir energy has a wider range of applicability and may be used to study other anisotropic mirrors .",
    "their formula has been used to evaluate numerically the effects of corrugation on the casimir force @xcite and torque @xcite and to calculate the casimir force between anisotropic metamaterials @xcite .",
    "mochn _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have argued that in thermal equilibrium , all of the properties of the radiation field within a cavity are completely determined by the optical reflection amplitudes of the walls .",
    "indeed , whenever a photon reaches the surface of a wall of the cavity it may be coherently reflected with an amplitude described by the optical coefficients of the wall .",
    "otherwise , it would be transmitted into the wall to be either absorbed , exciting the material degrees of freedom of its constituents , or transmitted across the wall and into the surrounding vacuum to be lost forever .",
    "the probability of these processes is again determined by the optical coefficients of the wall , and given by their squared modulus . in thermodynamic equilibrium",
    ", detailed balance implies that whenever a photon is lost , an equivalent photon is incoherently injected back to the cavity , so that both , the coherently and incoherently reflected photons are determined by the reflection amplitudes alone .",
    "therefore , the radiation field within a real cavity would be identical to the field within any cavity that has walls with the same optical properties .",
    "this fact allowed the construction of fictitious disipationless systems which can be simply treated quantum mechanically to obtain the vacuum energy and force for cavities with arbitrary walls .",
    "thus , expressions for the casimir force obtained from the electromagnetic stress tensor can be applied to semi - infinite or finite , homogeneous or layered , local or spatially dispersive , transparent or opaque systems through a simple substitution of the appropriate optical coefficients .",
    "this formalism has allowed the calculation of the casimir force between photonic structures @xcite , non - local excitonic semiconductors @xcite , non - local - plasmon - supporting metals with sharp boundaries @xcite , and between realistic spatially dispersive metals with a smooth self - consistent electronic density profile @xcite . with a few modifications ,",
    "it has also been employed for the calculation of other macroscopic forces , such as those due to electronic tunneling across an insulating gap separating two conductors @xcite .",
    "the relative simplicity of the formalism developed in @xcite has allowed its generalization to anisotropic systems @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a new derivation of the casimir torque within 1d cavities with walls made up of arbitrary materials characterized only by their anisotropic optical coefficients was presented . by 1d cavity we mean one in which the field is constrained to propagate only along one direction , namely , the normal to the surface of the cavity walls . in the present paper we generalize this formalism to 3d cavities with anisotropic walls .",
    "we calculate the casimir force from the electromagnetic stress tensor . a simple integration over the separation distance @xmath5 yields then the vacuum energy .",
    "the torque is then calculated by taking the derivative respect to the angle @xmath6 between the optical axes of the plates . as our formalism is based on the calculation of the force , which is a directly observable quantity , it avoids the cumbersome singularities that plague other approaches .",
    "furthermore , our results are written directly in terms of the optical coefficients of the walls of the cavity about which we make no assumption .",
    "thus , they can be applied immediately to manifold systems such as insulating or conducting anisotropic slabs either dissipationless or dissipative , to semiinfinite or finite walls and to homogeneous or structured materials .",
    "we test the validity of our approach by reproducing some known results @xcite and we show its versatility by applying it to some previously unexplored systems .    the structure of the paper is the following : in section [ approach ] we develop our formalism in order to arrive at expressions for the casimir energy between arbitrary anisotropic plates .",
    "the use of an effective cavity allows our results to be applicable to arbitrary slabs at any temperature @xmath7 . in section [ ideal ]",
    "we specialize our results to semi - infinite local uniaxial media and we apply our results to a calculation of the energy and torque for an idealized uniaxial system consisting of anisotropic mirrors that are perfectly conducting along one direction and perfectly insulating along the perpendicular directions . these calculations are performed for temperatures @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we also consider systems with a finite frequency - dependent conductivity along the optical axis .",
    "as a further application of our formalism , in section [ film ] we calculate the torque of a system consisting of two conducting plates with an anisotropic effective mass tensor , where one of the plates is a film with finite thickness @xmath10 , and we find there is an optimum value of @xmath10 that maximizes the torque .",
    "we also calculated the same system considered by munday et al .",
    "@xcite consisting of a semi - infinite slab of batio@xmath11 and a thin film of calcite .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusion ] we present our conclusions .",
    "consider the setup shown in fig .",
    "[ scattering](a ) .",
    "the slabs represents arbitrary media .    according to @xcite , in thermodynamic equilibrium the properties of the radiation field within the cavity @xmath12",
    "are completely determined by the geometry of the cavity , characterized by @xmath5 , and by the @xmath13 reflection amplitude matrices @xmath14 of each slab ( @xmath15 ) coupling @xmath16-polarized incident light to @xmath17-polarized reflected light ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "any relevant property of the material is completely accounted for through its optical coefficients .",
    "thus , the electromagnetic radiation within the real cavity @xmath12 must be identical to that within a fictitious cavity @xmath19 bounded by infinitely thin sheets at @xmath20 and @xmath21 , provided their reflection amplitudes @xmath14 are chosen to match those of the walls of the real cavity @xmath12 . the transmission amplitudes @xmath22 of the infinitely thin sheets",
    "are conveniently chosen in order to guarantee energy conservation with no absorption whatsoever of electromagnetic energy .",
    "thus , there is no absorption in the fictitious system , there is no excitation of material degrees of freedom and the normal modes of its electromagnetic field form a complete orthogonal basis of the corresponding hilbert space . as a consequence ,",
    "one is allowed to use well developed quantum - mechanical procedures for the calculation of the field properties without the requirement of a microscopic model of the material .",
    "the field modes may be quantized and counted by choosing suitable boundary conditions .",
    "for example , we can can add perfect mirrors far away from the walls of the real cavity ( fig .",
    "[ scattering](b ) ) , at @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "these quantizing mirrors produce a field that mimics the incoherent radiation back into the cavity that is responsible for maintaining a detailed balance and thus the thermodynamic equilibrium .",
