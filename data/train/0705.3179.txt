    "when a conducting solid - state system is smaller than the phase coherence length of the electrons , its electrical conductance is significantly influenced by quantum interference . for diffusive thin films",
    "this results in phenomena known as universal conductance fluctuations and weak localization @xcite .",
    "similar conductance fluctuations and localization phenomena are observed in micron - scale ballistic quantum dots , since these behave in practice as chaotic cavities due to small shape irregularities in the potential that defines the dot .",
    "these conductance fluctuations have been extensively studied for two - terminal quantum dots @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _  systems with only a source and a drain contact .",

    "the dot is coupled to four reservoirs via quantum point contacts ( qpc ) .",
    "in such a system , the voltage path ( with probes at voltage @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) can be separated from the path that is used for applying a bias current @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : device ] ) .",
    "consequently , one can measure so - called _ non - local _",
    "@xcite voltage signals that are purely due to quantum fluctuations of the chemical potential @xcite inside the dot , and for which a naive classical analysis predicts a signal very close to zero . for linear response , this is expressed as a non - local resistance @xmath3 ( this non - local resistance will fluctuate around a value that is very close to zero ohm , and is therefore studied in terms of resistance rather than conductance ) .",
    "increasing the number of open channels in the voltage probes will result in enhanced dephasing for the electronic interference effects . with a four - terminal system ,",
    "one can study this directly since it results in a reduction of the amplitude of the non - local resistance fluctuations .",
    "notably , such a reduction of the fluctuation amplitude does not occur upon increasing the number of open channels in a two - terminal system @xcite .",
    "furthermore , such a four - terminal systems could be used for studying signals that are due to spin . in a strong magnetic field qpcs",
    "can be operated as spin - selective injectors or voltage probes @xcite .",
    "this can be used to generate and detect an imbalance in the chemical potential for spin - up and spin - down electrons @xcite , similar to non - local spin - valve effects observed in metallic nanodevices @xcite . also here",
    ", a four - terminal dot is an interesting alternative to work on spin physics in dots with two - terminal devices @xcite .",
    "however , if such a system is smaller than the electron phase coherence length , the non - local signals with information about spin will also show fluctuations that result from interference of electron trajectories @xcite .",
    "in this article , we focus on our first experiments with such a four - terminal quantum dot .",
    "we aimed at characterizing the non - local resistance fluctuations , and studying the influence of the voltage probes on the typical amplitude of these fluctuations . as a comparison with our experimental results we present a numerical simulation of the non - local resistance , based on the landauer - bttiker formalism @xcite and the kicked rotator @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : section  [ sec : experimental ] presents the experimental realization . in section  [ sec : resflucdata ] , we present measurements of the non - local resistance as a function of bias voltage , gate voltage , and magnetic field , and confirm that the observed fluctuations in the non - local resistance are the four - terminal equivalent of universal conductance fluctuations in two - terminal systems . in section  [ sec : probecoupling ] ,",
    "we analyze how the typical amplitude of the measured non - local resistance fluctuations depends on the number of open channels in the voltage probes .",
    "section  [ sec : theory ] presents our theoretical analysis with a comparison to the experimental results , before ending with conclusions .",
    "our device was fabricated using a @xmath4 heterostructure containing a two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) 75 nm below the surface , purchased from sumitomo electric co. at 4.2 k , the mobility was @xmath5 and the electron density was @xmath6 .",
    "the dot was designed with an area of @xmath7 .",
    "figure [ fig : device ] shows and electron microscope image of the device .",
    "six depletion gates were deposited on the surface ( 15 nm of au with a ti sticking layer ) and were used for defining the dot in the 2deg .",
    "we estimate that the depletion width around the gates was about @xmath8 , such that the electron gas area @xmath9 inside the dot was about @xmath10 . with these six gates the dot",
    "could be coupled to the four reservoirs via qpcs in a controllable manner .",
    "all four qpcs showed clear quantized conductance steps @xcite in measurements where only the corresponding pair of gates were depleting the 2deg . note that throughout this article we use that a qpc with a conductance of @xmath11 is defined as having one open channel ( denoted as @xmath12 ) , _ i.e. _  we neglect spin when counting channels .",
    "the four reservoirs were connected to macroscopic leads via ohmic contacts , which were realized by annealing a thin au / ge / ni layer that was deposited on the surface .",
    "all the measurements were performed with the sample at a temperature of 130  mk .",
    "however , the temperature dependence of our data saturated when cooling below @xmath13 , so we will assume this value for the effective electron temperature .",
    "we used a current bias @xmath2 with standard ac lock - in techniques at 13 hz . unless stated otherwise , we used @xmath14 .",
    "the non - local resistance @xmath15 was then recorded as the zero - bias differential resistance @xmath16 , with @xmath17 defined as @xmath18 .",
    "we used a floating voltmeter to measure @xmath17 , thus being insensitive to the voltage across the dot along the current path , and thereby insensitive to coulomb blockade and weak localization effects . on the current path , only the @xmath19 reservoir was connected to the grounded shielding of our setup , and all gate voltages were applied with respect to this ground .",
    "a magnetic field could be applied , with an angle of 7@xmath20 with respect to the 2deg plane ( determined from standard hall measurements and electron focusing effects , discussed below ) .",
    "the perpendicular component of this field was used for studying the dependence of the non - local resistance on perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the component of the magnetic field parallel with the 2deg plane was oriented perpendicular to the current path .",
    "while this parallel field was about ten times stronger than the perpendicular field , the orbital effects associated with this parallel field are negligibly small , and it can be disregarded for all of the experimental results presented here ( and weak enough to not significantly reduce the amplitude of resistance fluctuations @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : gatedependence ] shows the non - local resistance @xmath15 as a function of the voltage applied to gate @xmath21 and gate @xmath22 .",
    "the other four gate voltages were kept constant during this measurement , with the qpcs in the current path at a conductance of @xmath11 each ( one open channel , @xmath12 ) .",
    "the range of gate voltage for @xmath21 and @xmath22 used here corresponds to opening the voltage - probe qpcs from nearly pinched off ( @xmath23 ) up to about @xmath24 open channels . as a function of these gate voltages",
    ", the non - local resistance shows a random pattern of fluctuations around zero ohm , with maximums and minimums up to about @xmath25 .",
    "notably , the change in gate voltage needed to change @xmath15 significantly ( one fluctuation ) , is very similar to the change in gate voltage needed for increasing the number of open channels in a qpc by one .",
    "this corresponds to changing the shape of the potential that forms the dot by a distance of about half a fermi wavelength , which is consistent with the length scale needed for significantly changing a random interference pattern of electron trajectories .",
    "these non - local resistance fluctuations as a function of the gate voltage on @xmath21 and @xmath22 were highly reproducible , and indeed a so - called finger print of the sample . the identical measurement repeated after 4 days ( during which we performed strong magnetic field sweeps and a temperature cycle up to 4.2 k ) showed nominally the same fluctuation pattern as in fig .",

    "[ fig : thouless ] we present results of studying the dependence of the amplitude of the non - local resistance fluctuations on the amplitude of the applied bias current @xmath2 .",
    "the figure shows measurements of @xmath15 as a function of the gate voltage @xmath26 .",
    "the results show several fluctuations that are reproducible , but decreasing in amplitude upon increasing the amplitude of the bias current . in this experiment ,",
    "the conductance of the other three qpcs was fixed at @xmath11 .",
    "the amplitude of the fluctuations reduces when the measurement averages over contributions of electrons in uncorrelated orbitals , that is , averaging over electrons that differ in energy by more than the thouless energy @xcite .",
    "when the current bias is increased , the corresponding voltage bias @xmath27 increases as well ( see labels in the fig .  [",
    "fig : thouless ] ) , and this is used to experimentally estimate the thouless energy @xmath28 for our system .",
    "the amplitude of the fluctuations starts to decrease significantly around @xmath29 .",
    "this is close to a theoretical estimate @xcite for @xmath30 , where @xmath31 the fermi velocity and @xmath32 the effective width of the dot .",
    "we now turn to measurements of the non - local resistance as a function of perpendicular magnetic field , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : bfield]a . here",

    "the trace of @xmath15 shows random fluctuations of similar amplitude as observed in the gate voltage dependence . for estimating the typical magnetic field scale that significantly changes the value of @xmath15 ( the correlation field @xmath33 ) , we apply an established method from such studies on similar two - terminal quantum dot systems ( following refs .  ) .",

    "[ fig : bfield]a ( only using the low - field data in the range @xmath35 , see below ) . on a logarithmic scale , @xmath34 closely resembles a straight line with negative slope in the frequency range between @xmath36 and 0.5 cycles per mt ( and then levels off ) , very similar to the results from the studies with two - terminal dots @xcite .",
    "we fit this part of the spectrum to the form predicted by semiclassical theory @xcite , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 the flux quantum , and @xmath39 the inverse of an effective area for orbitals in the dot which defines @xmath40 .",
    "this yields @xmath41 ( the large error bar must be assumed since we could only measure a small number of independent fluctuations for this analysis ) .",
    "this is in good agreement with theory for universal conductance fluctuations @xcite , which predicts @xmath42 ( simply expressing the magnetic field needed for adding one flux quantum @xmath43 through the area of the dot ) .",
    "it is commonly observed that @xmath44 is enhanced by a factor up to about @xmath45 due to flux cancelation effects for electrons that move ballistically between the edges of the dot @xcite .",
    "the measured value for @xmath44 is also in agreement with the observation of a weak - localization peak around zero magnetic field @xcite observed in the two - terminal resistance ( breaking the time - reversal symmetry ) , which has a width of the same order of magnitude as @xmath44 .    for confirming that changing the field by more than @xmath44 gives access to a statistically independent set of fluctuations , we studied fluctuations in @xmath15 as a function of gate voltage @xmath26 , for different values of the perpendicular field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bfield]b ) .",
    "this data confirms that changing the perpendicular magnetic field in steps of 14  mt gives access to completely different patterns of random fluctuations in @xmath15 .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : bfield]a shows the appearance of much higher peaks in @xmath15 ( up to @xmath46 ) for perpendicular magnetic fields stronger than @xmath35 .",
    "we could confirm that these peaks are due to electron focusing and skipping orbit effects .",
    "with only the three gates @xmath21 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 depleting the 2deg , our device is identical to devices used for electron focusing experiments by van houten _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and we observe very similar focusing peaks as in this work at only one polarity of the magnetic field . with the dot formed , these effects cause peaks in @xmath15 at both polarities of the magnetic field",
    ". the onset of these effects at @xmath49 agrees with a focusing radius of about @xmath50 .",
    "the presence of additional voltage probes on a quantum dot system will act as source of dephasing for the electrons in the dot , and this effect should increase when the coupling between the dot and the probe reservoirs is enhanced .",
    "earlier work recognized that non - local voltage probes on a mesoscopic system are a source of dephasing @xcite , and in theoretical work an additional voltage probe is often used to model a source of dephasing @xcite .",
    "this can be directly studied with our system .",
    "the amplitude of the non - local resistance fluctuations ( which result from electron phase coherence ) should decrease when the voltage probes are tuned to carry more open channels . to study this effect",
    "we used data sets of the type presented in fig .",

    "the theory in the next section shows that , on such a line , @xmath54 should also show a weak dependence on @xmath55 - @xmath56 .",

    "the results of this analysis are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : flucanalysis ] .",
    "the large error bars for @xmath57 and @xmath54 in fig .  [ fig : flucanalysis ] are due to the fact that we could only record a finite number of independent data sets with fluctuations in @xmath15 ( see ref .   for further details ) .    the results in fig .",

    "moreover , such dephasing is possibly consistent with the simple scaling that was needed to obtain agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "theory for two - terminal quantum dots gives that the influence of dephasing on the amplitude of conductance fluctuations is that it scales the amplitude down by a factor @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the mean dwell time in the dot and @xmath80 is the dephasing time @xcite .",

    "@xmath91 is the number of open modes to a fictitious voltage probe that is responsible for dephasing in the dot , and @xmath92 is now the number of modes per lead for a two - terminal dot , so we set it to @xmath93 for our system with four qpcs tuned to @xmath12 .",

    "the independently determined values for @xmath79 and @xmath80 give for the factor @xmath97 , which differs only by a factor @xmath45 from the value 20 that we obtained from the scaling .",
    "this supports the assumption that the reduction in the fluctuation amplitude @xmath54 is due to orbital dephasing inside the dot .",
    "however , the above analysis is only valid for all qpcs of the dot tuned to @xmath12 . while we can apply a single scaling factor for all values of @xmath55 + @xmath56 in fig .",
    "[ fig : flucanalysis ] , @xmath79 decreases in fact significantly with increasing @xmath55 + @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , it is tempting to consider that the reduction in @xmath54 can be understood by assuming that dephasing in the dot increases the value of @xmath55 + @xmath56 to an effective value of @xmath55 + @xmath98 .",
    "however , this is clearly not in agreement with the observed drop in @xmath54 over the interval @xmath55 + @xmath56 in fig .",
