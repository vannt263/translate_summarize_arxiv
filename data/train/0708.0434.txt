    "the last decade has seen a renewed interest in the study of the casimir force @xcite .",
    "casimir predicted that two neutral parallel plates will attract each other due to a force arising from quantum vacuum fluctuations .",
    "the interest in this force arises from the precise measurements between metallic @xcite and dielectric systems @xcite that are now possible .",
    "the measurements have confirmed the validity of casimir s theory and lifshitz formulation @xcite , that takes into account the dielectric properties of the plates .",
    "the lifshitz theory gives the casimir force or the van der waals force in the retarded and non - retarded limit between extended bodies .",
    "usually , in the literature some authors use the term van der waals force in the non - retarded limit and the term casimir force in the retarded limit @xcite .",
    "recent research in casimir forces is focused in having a precise comparison between theory and experiment . to achieve this",
    ", several physical characteristics of the plates have to be known such as conductivity @xcite , roughness @xcite and finite temperature effects and its controversies due to the apparent violation of nerst heat theorem @xcite .",
    "the casimir force has also been considered as a possible actuating force in micro and nano electromechanical devices ( mems and nems ) . in 1995",
    "_ were the first to consider the role that casimir forces could have in meme by analyzing the dynamics of a micro system actuated only by casimir forces @xcite .",
    "later , this system was realized experimentally by chan @xcite who also able to excite a micro torsional balance in its non linear mode using only the casimir force @xcite . a recent review of casimir forces in nanomechanics an nanotechnology can be found in reference @xcite .",
    "later , the deflection of micro membrane strips under a purely casimir load was also studied by serry @xcite .",
    "these works suggested that another consequence of the casimir force in micro and nano devices , was that it could limit the operation of modern mems and nems by causing a pull - in or snap down instability similar to what happens to electrostaticaly actuated devices @xcite .",
    "the stability of mems in the presence of casimir has also been studied by several authors @xcite as well as the pull - in dynamics when both electrostatic and casimir forces are present @xcite . however , as shown by delrio @xmath0 @xcite , the casimir force is relevant in the pull - in dynamics in the non retarded limit ( or van der waals regime ) . in the case of metals , the nonretarded limit corresponds to separations smaller than the plasma wavelength of the material .    unlike the electrostatic case , the casimir force can not be turned - off and is always present .",
    "its influence can be reduced in several ways .",
    "for example , using thin conducting films will reduce the casimir force @xcite or using low dielectric function materials such as @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that it is possible to change the sign of the force from attractive to repulsive using high magnetic susceptibility materials @xcite .    in this work",
    "we show that the casimir force can be reduced drastically using silicon based aerogels .",
    "in particular , we discuss the use of @xmath2 aerogels and how the dielectric function of the aerogels rescales the casimir force .",
    "the calculations are done in the lifshitz approach at zero temperature and assuming only frequency dependent dielectric functions .",
    "the casimir force per unit area between two arbitrary flat surfaces labeled @xmath3 separated a distance @xmath4 is calculated using the lifshitz formula @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in these expressions , the factors @xmath8 are the reflectivities for either @xmath9 or @xmath10 polarized light , @xmath11 is the wavevector component along the plates , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the above expression is evaluated along the imaginary frequency axis @xmath14 .",
    "when the reflectivities are replaced by the fresnel coefficients , the original lifshitz formula is recovered . for perfect conductors , @xmath15 and eq .",
    "( [ lifshitz ] ) yields casimir s known expression for the force in the ideal case , @xmath16    in general , the problem of calculating the casimir force between two surfaces reduces to finding the reflection coefficients given dielectric function of the materials . for a slab of thicknesss @xmath17 and dielectric function @xmath18 on top of a half space of a material characterized by a dielectric function",
    "@xmath19 the reflection amplitudes are @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the fresnel coefficients between material @xmath22 and @xmath23 where the subindex @xmath24 stands for vacuum .",
    "the optical length is defined as @xcite @xmath25 these definitions of the reflection amplitude and optical length are in the rotated space @xmath26 .",
    "this is , we change , @xmath27 .",
    "in this work we consider the use of aerogels to reduce the magnitude of the casimir force .",
    "aerogels are highly porous materials fabricated typically from @xmath2 using sol - gel techniques .",
    "the porosity is as high as @xmath28 and they are promising materials in the semiconductor industry @xcite due to their low thermal conductivity , low density , good mechanical strength to compressional loads and their luminescent properties make them suitable in high energy physics detectors @xcite .",
    "the property we are interested in is the dielectric function .",
    "aerogels are the solids with the lowest index of refraction in the visible range @xmath29 depending on the porosity . the dielectric behavior of aerogels are dominated by the air voids rather than by the solid part @xcite and the index of refraction varies linearly with porosity , as has been shown in several measurements in limited frequency ranges @xcite . to calculate the casimir force we need the dielectric response of the aerogel in a broad frequency range",
    "this is done using an effective medium formalism such as a clausius - mossotti approximation .",
    "this approximation is adequate given the high porosity of the aerogels .",
    "other formalisms , such as looyenga s approach @xcite have also been used to describe the effective optical properties of porous media at lower porosities . taking the dielectric function of air equal to one for all frequencies , the dielectric function of @xmath30 of the aerogel is obtained from    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the porosity of the sample",
    ". the dielectric function of the @xmath2 can be obtained from tabulated data @xcite .",
    "the tabulated data expands a wide frequency range from 0.00218 ev to 2000 ev being enough to calculate the casimir force for separations between @xmath33 @xmath34 .",
    "the dielectric function in the imaginary frequency domain is obtained from @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the imaginary part of the dielectric function that is obtained from the tabulated data . with the dielectric function of the silicon oxide and eq.([effective ] )",
    "the reflection coefficients and hence the casimir force can be calculated . in this work",
    "we calculate the reduction factor define as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is given by eq.([lifshitz ] ) and @xmath39 is the ideal casimir force ( eq.([ideal ] ) ) .",
    "let us consider first the casimir force between two aerogel layers of thickness @xmath17 deposited on top of @xmath40 substrates .",
    "the substrates are assumed as half - spaces and the dielectric function of @xmath40 is modeled using a drude model with a plasma frequency of @xmath41 @xmath42 and a damping constant of @xmath43 .",
    "depending on the values of the drude parameters and the tabulated data used , variations of few percents on the calculated force are expected as discussed recently by piroshenko @xcite .",
    "although the use of the drude model at finite temperature has been questioned due to the apparent violation of nerst heat theorem , we will not elaborate in this issue since we are interested in the effect of the aerogel on the casimir force @xcite .",
    "the reduction factor as a function of separation for different thicknesses of the aerogel layers is shown in fig .",
    "1 . as a reference",
    "we have also plotted the reduction factor for a @xmath1 layer @xmath44 @xmath45 thick since this is a common dielectric that has been studied in connection with the casimir force . for small separations ,",
    "the reduction factor is of the order or @xmath46 .",
    "this is close to one tenth of the expected value of the @xmath1 layer .",
    "the thicker the value of the aerogel layer the smaller and flatter the reduction factor becomes in a wider range of the separation .",
    "this behavior can be understood considering that for a given frequency and value of the normal wave vector , the optical length increases as @xmath17 increases .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the exponential term in eq.([reflect ] ) becomes smaller for thicker slabs and the dominant contribution to the reflection comes from @xmath47 . for thinner slabs the term containing the exponential has a bigger contribution from the aerogel - au reflection amplitude @xmath48 hence",
    ", the overall reflection amplitude is bigger and the force increases . in figure 1 and subsequent plots",
    "the separation between the slabs ranges from @xmath49 @xmath45 to @xmath50 @xmath34 that is a reasonable experimental range to probe the casimir force .",
    "also we assume that the porosity of the aerogel is @xmath51 .",
    "the measurements of the casimir force is commonly made between a @xmath40 @xcite and a second surface that can be a metal or semiconductor .",
    "a more realistic configuration in our calculations is to consider the force between a @xmath40 half space and a aerogel supported also on a @xmath40 substrate as shown in the inset of figure 2 .",
    "also , in this figure the reduction factor is presented again for various values of the aerogel thickness .",
    "the force is slightly larger than in figure 1 , but even in this case there is a significant reduction . from both figure ( 1 ) and ( 2 )",
    "we see that the aerogel layer acts as a buffer than effectively increase the distance between the @xmath40 slabs , thus decreasing the force .",
    "the role of the @xmath40 substrate is also important and if it is remove the reduction factor shows a different behavior as shown in figure 3 . in this case",
    "we plot the reduction factor as a function of plate separation @xmath4 for slabs of thickness @xmath17 .",
    "the reduction factor decreases as the separation increases in all cases .",
    "indeed the force can be reduced several orders of magnitude for large separations depending on the aerogel slab thickness . for all practical purposes , aerogels will suppress the casimir force below the range of detectability of current experiments even at short separations .",
    "finally let us consider the role of porosity .",
    "in figure 4 we plot the reduction factor for two unsupported aerogel slabs of thickness @xmath52@xmath45 for different porosities . as expected as the porosity increases ,",
    "the dielectric function is lower and the casimir force decreases .",
    "the inset shows the value of the reduction factor at a fixed separation of @xmath53@xmath34 , again for different porosities .",
    "notice that the vertical axis of the inset has to be multiplied by @xmath54 .",
    "this shows that the porosity can be an effective control parameter to modulate the value of the casimir force .",
    "of particular importance will be the control of pull - in instabilities in micro and nano devices @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , in this work we presented the first numerical study of the use of aerogels to control the casimir force by reducing its value significantly .",
    "there are two control parameters that can be changed to modify the force .",
    "one is the thickness slab and the second one is the porosity of the aerogel .",
    "also , the role of a metallic substrate is evaluated .",
    "even when the aerogels have a au backing the force can be up to orders of magnitude smaller than for perfect metals . as compared to bulk @xmath1",
    ", aerogels can decrease the casimir force in several orders of magnitude .",
    "other options that can be consider to reduce the casimir force is to use porous semiconductor composites such as @xmath55 or porous @xmath1 @xcite .",
