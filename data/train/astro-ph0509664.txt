    "current solar flare models ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) predict two types of chromospheric evaporation processes . `` gentle '' evaporation occurs when the chromosphere is heated either directly by non - thermal electrons , or indirectly by thermal conduction .",
    "the chromospheric plasma subsequently loses energy via a combination of radiation and low - velocity hydrodynamic expansion .",
    "`` explosive '' evaporation takes place when the chromosphere is unable to radiate energy at a sufficent rate and consequently expands at high velocities into the overlying flare loops .",
    "the overpressure of evaporated material also drives low - velocity downward motions into the underlying chromosphere , in a process known as chromospheric condensation .    from a theoretical perspective , @xcite investigated the relationship between the flux of non - thermal electrons ( @xmath8 ) and the velocity response of the atmosphere for the two classes of evaporation . for gentle evaporation ,",
    "non - thermal electron fluxes of @xmath9 10@xmath3  ergs  @xmath4  s@xmath5 were found to produce upflow velocities of tens of kilometres per second .",
    "in contrast , explosive evaporation was found to be associated with higher non - thermal electron fluxes ( @xmath10 3  @xmath2  10@xmath3  ergs  @xmath4  s@xmath5 ) which drive both upflows of hot material at velocities of several hundred kilometres per second _ and _ downflows of cooler material at tens of kilometres per second .",
    "observationally , previous studies have identified blue - shifted soft x - ray and euv lines indicative of chromospheric evaporation . using the bent crystal spectrometer onboard the _ solar maximum mission _ , @xcite and @xcite reported upflow velocities of 400  km  s@xmath5 and 350  km  s@xmath5 , respectively , in lines ( 3.13.2   ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite observed velocities of 140200  km  s@xmath5 in ( 592.23   ) , using the coronal diagnostic spectrometer ( cds ; @xcite ) onboard the _ solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho)_. simultaneous upflows and downflows during a hard x - ray ( hxr ) burst indicative of explosive evaporation have been observed using cds and _ yohkoh_/hard x - ray telescope by @xcite . while these studies provided a measurement of the dynamic response of the flaring chromosphere , they were unable to provide a measurement of the flux of electrons responsible for driving such motions , nor the spatial relationship between the two .    in this",
    ", simultaneous _ reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager _",
    "( _ rhessi _ ; @xcite ) and cds observations are combined for the first time to investigate the relationship between the non - thermal electron flux and the response of the solar atmosphere . in section  [ obs ] the analysis techniques employed are described , while the results are presented in section  [ results ] .",
    "our conclusions are then given in section  [ disc ] .",
    "this study focuses on a _ goes _",
    "m2.2 flare , which began at 12:44  ut on 2003 june 10 .",
    "the event was selected from a sample of approximately 50 flares jointly observed by _ rhessi _ and cds .",
    "the limited field of view , cadence , and operating schedule of cds , coupled with _",
    "nighttime and south atlantic anomaly passes , make simultaneous observations by the two instruments quite rare .",
    "the cds observations reported here were obtained with the _ flare_ar _ observing sequence .",
    "_ flare_ar _ contains five @xmath114    wide spectral windows centered on ( 584.33   ; log t = 4.5 ) , ( 629.73   ; log t = 5.4 ) , ( 624.94   ; log t = 6.1 ) , ( 360.76   ; log t = 6.4 ) , and ( 592.23   ; log t = 6.9 ) .",
    "each raster consists of 45 slit positions , each @xmath015 seconds long , resulting in an effective cadence of @xmath011 minutes .",
    "the slit itself is 4@xmath2180  yielding a @xmath0180@xmath2180  field of view . a zoomed - in region of the , , and rasters from the impulsive phase of the flare is given in figure  [ hsi_cds_eit ] .",
    "also shown is the extreme ultraviolet imaging telescope ( eit ; @xcite ) 195    passband image obtained at 12:48  ut .",
    "a series of subsequent eit images makes it clear that the he i and o v brightenings come from a flare ribbon rather than two distinct footpoints as figure  [ hsi_cds_eit ] may suggest .",
    "the spectrum from each cds pixel was fitted with a broadened gaussian profile @xcite , for each of the five spectral windows .",
    "velocity maps were created by measuring doppler shifts relative to quiet - sun spectra , which were assumed to be emitted by stationary plasma .",
    "preliminary fits to the line during the impulsive phase of the flare revealed an asymmetric broadening beyond the instrumental resolution of cds .",
    "the strongest blue asymmetries were found within the flare ribbon during the impulsive phase . outside this area , and after the impulsive phase , the fe xix line was observed to have a width comparible to the instrumental width .",
    "figure  [ cds_spec ] shows a sample of spectra taken from the spectral window centered on the ( 592.23   ) emission line .",
    "panel ` a ' shows a spectrum from a quiet sun area in which no emission was visible . instead ,",
    "a weak emission line was observed at 592.6    which @xcite have identified as .",
    "panel ` b ' shows a stationary emission line extracted from a bright region , but after the impulsive phase at @xmath012:50  ut when no significant flows are expected . an emission line with a strong blue asymmetry",
    "is shown in panel ` c ' .",
    "this was extracted from the flare ribbon during the impulsive phase .",
    "the best fit to this line was consistent with stationary and blue - shifted components , both with widths comparible to the instrumental resolution .",
    "as is not observed in quiet - sun spectra , and following from @xcite , the doppler velocity was measured as the shift between these two components .",
    "a heliographic correction was also applied , due to the longitude of the observations and assuming purely radial flows ,          _ rhessi _ is an imaging spectrometer capable of observing x- and @xmath12-ray emission over a wide range of energies ( @xmath03  kev17  mev ) . during this event the thin attenuators on _ rhessi",
    "_ were in place thus limiting the energy range to @xmath136  kev .",
    "flare emission was not observed above @xmath060  kev .",
    "the flare lightcurves are shown in the top panel of figure  [ hsi_spec ] . both the _ rhessi _ images and spectra were obtained over a 64 second period from 12:47:3412:48:38  ut to coincide with the timerange over which cds observed blue asymmetries in the line .",
    "this time interval lies within the impulsive 2560  kev hxr burst and is indicated by two vertical dotted lines in the top panel of figure  [ hsi_spec ] .",
    "_ rhessi _ images in two energy bands ( 1225 and 2560  kev ) were reconstructed using the _ pixon _ algorithm @xcite .",
    "contours at 10% of the peak intensity in each band are overlayed on each euv image in figure  [ hsi_cds_eit ] .",
    "the _ rhessi _ spectrum was fitted assuming an isothermal distribution at low energies , and thick - target emission at higher energies ( bottom panel of figure  [ hsi_spec ] ) .",
    "a thick - target model was chosen over a thin - target model as it is believed that the density of the flare loop is insufficent to thermalise the electrons as they propagate to the chromosphere .",
    "the thick - target model is used in the vast majority of cases ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , in this flare the hxr source is clearly aligned with the he i ribbon as seen by cds , which implies that the accelerated electrons are losing their energy in the dense chromosphere rather than in the coronal loops .",
    "the total power of non - thermal electrons above the low energy cut - off ( @xmath14 ) was calculated from @xmath15 ergs  s@xmath5 , where @xmath16 @xmath0 @xmath17 electrons kev@xmath5 s@xmath5 is the thick - target electron injection spectrum and @xmath18 is the associated spectral index @xcite . because of the steepness of the _ rhessi _ spectrum at high energies , the non - thermal flux is quite sensitive to the value of the low energy cut - off . in order to put a constraint on this value ,",
    "the temperature of the thermal component was obtained by another independent method , i.e. the equivalent width of the fe line complex at 6.7 kev ( @xcite ) .",
    "the value of the equivalent width of this line , which is quite sensitive to the temperature , was used to estimate the temperature of the thermal component .",
    "having fixed this value , the entire _ rhessi _ spectrum was fitted using a least - squares fit .",
    "the thick - target model fitted to the _ rhessi _ spectrum in figure  [ hsi_spec ] was consistent with an electron distribution having @xmath1920  kev and @xmath207.3 .",
    "the break energy of 20  kev is consistent with earlier works ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . the total power in non - thermal electrons was therefore 1@xmath210@xmath21  ergs  s@xmath5 . exploring the possible range of values for the break energy for this flare would yield an electron power value of 4@xmath210@xmath21  ergs  s@xmath5 for @xmath22 = 15.0  kev while @xmath22 = 25.0  kev would give a power value of 6@xmath210@xmath23  ergs  s@xmath5 .",
    "however , either of these break energies would give a worse @xmath24 value than obtained from the original fit . by comparison ,",
    "the total thermal power for the same time interval was found to be 1.2@xmath210@xmath23  ergs  s@xmath5 .",
    "using the reconstructed 2560  kev image , an upper - limit to source size was calculated to be 2.3@xmath210@xmath25  @xmath26 .",
    "this was found by summing over all pixels with counts greater than 10% of the peak value .",
    "this threshold was chosen to eliminate sources outside of the main hxr - emitting region , which were assumed to be unreal ; the source area was not found to be highly sensitive to this value .",
    "for example , a threshold of 5% yielded an area of 3.2@xmath210@xmath25  @xmath26 and 15% yielded 2@xmath210@xmath25  @xmath26 .",
    "this area was also confirmed using the fourier modulation profiles from each of _ rhessi _ s nine detectors , which are sensitive to spatial scales from 2.2to 183 . assuming a filling factor of unity ,",
    "the resulting non - thermal electron flux was calculated to be @xmath14@xmath210@xmath3  ergs  @xmath4  s@xmath5 .",
    "and the arrow denotes the direction in which the cds slit moves .",
    "black regions in the map represent pixels where no significant emission was observed .",
    "2560  kev contours at 10% and 40% of the peak intensity are overlayed.,width=302 ]        figure  [ vel_maps ] shows velocity maps in the and lines .",
    "the map shows consistent downflows of 2050  km  s@xmath5 until the slit leaves the flaring region at @xmath012:50  ut . a velocity map in showed a similar trend .",
    "however , the map shows strong upflow velocities of 190280  km  s@xmath5 during the hxr peak , indicated by ` t@xmath27 ' and ` t@xmath28 ' on figures  [ hsi_spec ] and [ vel_maps ] .",
    "no significant upflows were evident once the hxrs begin to diminish from time t@xmath28 onwards .    by identifying each pixel in the map that required a two - component fit to the line profile , between times t@xmath27 and t@xmath28",
    ", the velocity was measured for the corresponding pixel in each of the five cds rasters . figure  [ vel_plot ] shows the mean velocity as a function of temperature for each line using the methods described in section  [ obs ] .",
    "the error bars represent a 1@xmath7 dispersion . at chromospheric and transition region temperatures ,",
    "plasma velocities show red - shifts of 36@xmath616  km  s@xmath5 and 43@xmath622  km  s@xmath5 , respectively , while the blue - shift observed in the 8  mk line corresponds to a velocity of 230@xmath638  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "no significant flows were observed in the and lines .",
    "the combination of high - velocity upflows and low - velocity downflows , together with a non - thermal electron flux of @xmath14@xmath210@xmath3  ergs  @xmath4  s@xmath5 provides clear evidence for explosive chromospheric evaporation .",
    "for the first time , co - spatial and co - temporal hxr and euv observations of chromospheric evaporation are presented using _",
    "rhessi _ and _ soho_/cds .",
    "high upflows velocities ( @xmath0230  km  s@xmath5 ) were clearly observed in high - temperature emission during the impulsive phase of an m2.2 flare , while much lower downflow velocities ( @xmath040  km  s@xmath5 ) were observed in the cooler and lines . the value of the non - thermal electron flux ( @xmath14@xmath210@xmath3  ergs  @xmath4  s@xmath5 ) and the resulting velocity response are indicative of an explosive evaporation process occuring during this flare , as laid out in @xcite and @xcite .    the combination of hxr and euv observations presented in this _",
    "letter _ have enabled us to obtain a greater understanding of the characteristics of chromospheric evaporation , a fundamental process in solar flares .",
    "we have presented the first detection of explosive mass motions within hxr footpoints , and determined the flux of non - thermal electrons responsible for driving such flows .",
