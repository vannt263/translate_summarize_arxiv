    "the tully - fisher relation ( tully & fisher , 1977 ) is a direct indication of a close relationship between the detected baryons and the total mass in spiral galaxies .",
    "the detected baryons consist of the stellar and gaseous content , i.e. the visible mass , and this sets the luminosity profile of the galaxy while the total gravitational mass , which includes the dark matter content ( and possibly a component of baryonic dark matter ) , sets its rotation velocity .",
    "numerous studies have been carried out to investigate this relation , crucial in determining extragalactic distances ( e. g. pierce & tully 1988 , tully & pierce 2000 ) , in the study of evolution of galaxies ( e.g. puech et al .",
    "2008 ) and also in giving constraints on cosmological galaxy formation models ( e. g. portinari & sommer - larsen 2007 ) .",
    "the tully - fisher relation is undoubtedly a crucial test for galaxy evolution models and although it has been the focus of a number of studies , its origin is still being debated . a few authors argue a cosmological origin ( e. g. avila - reese , firmani & hernndez 1998 ) while others suggest that this relation is regulated by star forming processes ( e. g. silk 1997 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the tully - fisher relation is related to the stellar populations of galaxies as it is suggested by its steeper slope when the luminosity is measured in the near infrared ( nir ) bands , when compared to the slope measured in the optical ( e.g. tully & pierce , 2000 ) .",
    "the use of nir bands in the tully - fisher relation has shown to be extremely useful , because nir bands present lower internal extinction than optical bands ( verheijen 2001 ) and the mass - to - light ratio is less contaminated by younger stellar populations , giving a better reflection of the stellar mass of the galaxies .",
    "luminosities can be converted into stellar masses by scaling them by a given mass - to - light ratio .",
    "thus , instead of linking rotation velocities to luminosities , a few authors have chosen to show the correlation of rotation velocities to stellar masses .",
    "this relation is called stellar tully - fisher relation ( e.g. bell & de jong 2001 ) . in order to estimate the whole baryonic mass ,",
    "the gaseous component should be added to the stellar mass .",
    "the relation between luminosities and baryonic masses is called the baryonic tully - fisher relation .",
    "this relation has been studied by several authors ( e. g. mcgaugh 2000 , verheijen 2001 , geha et al .",
    "2006 , bell & de jong 2001 ) .",
    "the slope of the baryonic tf relation is an important test for galaxy formation models .",
    "a steeper slope indicates that the baryonic mass of massive galaxies tends to approximately match the total mass of the galaxy .    to date",
    ", most of the works devoted to study the tully - fisher relation have used compilations of several galaxy surveys , observed in different ways ( hi line profiles and rotation curves ) adding factors of uncertainties due to sample non - homogeneity . beside the problems of using different samples , the use of certain observational techniques may add other uncertainties in the study of the tully - fisher relation .",
    "for example , an over or under prediction of the position angle in long - slit observation could produce an erroneous estimate of the maximum velocity of a galaxy , which will be reflected in the tully - fisher relation .    in order to avoid the problems listed in the previous paragraph , we have made use of the homogeneous galaxy survey gassendi halpha survey of spirals ( ghasp ) to study the nir , stellar and baryonic tully - fisher relations and their implications for the total mass of galaxies .",
    "the ghasp survey represents a large effort to constitute a sample of field galaxies in an homogeneous way .",
    "first , a strict isolation criterion has been used to insure the isolation of the galaxies .",
    "rather close galaxies have been chosen in order to guarantee a high spatial resolution , compared to hi surveys .",
    "high and low inclination objects have been excluded in order to minimize uncertainties in the de - projected rotation curve .",
    "second , all ghasp galaxies have been observed using the same instrument ; a scanning fabry - perot attached to a focal reducer at the 193 cm at observatoire de haute provence ( ohp ) .",
    "in addition to obtaining data for the whole sample with the same instrument , which is a great advantage to insure homogeneity , the scanning fabry - perot is certainly the most adapted instrument to obtain rotation curves in the most proper way . because it gives a 2d velocity field , we can obtain the rotation curve ( and the maximum velocity ) without any previous assumptions about the position angle or the inclination like it is the case for long - slit observations .",
    "this technique avoids , in this way , a great factor of uncertainty that is common to not be taken into account using other techniques .",
    "third , the data reduction has been performed in an homogeneous way , in order to derive the rotation curves from the velocity fields in the cleanest and most rigorous possible way ( see epinat et al .",
    "2008a , b for details ) .",
    "these three points allowed eliminating ( or at least greatly minimizing ) several problems that previous studies have encountered . using rotation curves to obtain",
    "the maximum rotation velocity is a more precise way compared to the hi line width profile technique , used by several others studies .",
    "the higher spatial resolution of optical velocity maps , compared to hi , avoids the problem of missing the maximum velocity because of lack of resolution ( beam smearing ) .    together with the kinematic information , we have used h and k - band photometry from 2mass survey , mass - to - light ratios derived from stellar population models , hi fluxes and h@xmath2 masses from the literature to perform , for the first time , the nir , stellar and baryonic tully - fisher relations for the ghasp sample .    in  2",
    "we describe the data , including the method used to compute the stellar , gaseous and baryonic masses . in  3 , we present the results . in ",
    "4 we discuss and compare our results with previous works .",
    "finally , we summarize our main findings in  5 .",
    "ghasp is the largest sample of spiral and irregular galaxies observed to date using fabry - perot techniques .",
    "it consists of 3d h@xmath3 data cubes for 203 galaxies , covering a large range in morphological types and absolute magnitudes .",
    "all the ghasp galaxies have been recently reanalyzed in a homogeneous way in epinat et al .",
    "( 2008a , b ) .",
    "these authors published velocity fields , monochromatic h@xmath3 images , dispersion velocity maps , rotation curves and maximum rotation velocities ( v@xmath4 ) for each galaxy .",
    "a sub - sample of 93 galaxies has been selected by removing from the sample : 1 ) galaxies with radial systemic velocities lower than 3000 km s@xmath5 ( to avoid the effect of the local group infall ) for which no other individual measurements of distances were available ( the references are indicated in epinat et al .",
    "2008b ) and 2 ) galaxies with inclinations lower than 25 degrees for which the uncertainties on the rotational velocity is comparatively high .",
    "rotation curves shown in epinat et al .",
    "( 2008a , b ) present a large variety of shapes ( from falling to rising ) and degrees of asymmetry . in order to study the influence of the shape of the rotation curves in the tully - fisher relation , we have made a classification of our sample in three subsamples , i. e. rising , flat and decreasing rotation curves , which will be described with the letters `` r '' , `` f '' and `` d '' , respectively",
    ". an `` + '' or ` ' sign has been added if the rotation curve is respectively more or less extended than the optical radius of the galaxy ( r@xmath6 ) .",
    "no symbol is added if the radius of the observed rotation curve is barely equal to r@xmath6 .",
    "a decreasing or flat rotation curve displays a clear v@xmath4 .",
    "this is not the case for a rotation curve which rises up to the very last observed radius , for which @xmath7 is possibly underestimated .",
    "this is even worse if the rising rotation curve does not reach the optical radius . in this case , v@xmath4 was computed at r@xmath6 by extrapolating an _ arctan _ function ( @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the core radius ) to the rotation curves . if observed rotational velocities at r@xmath10r@xmath6 are higher than the modeled value , the observed values have been used .",
    "this could be the case if large scale bumps in the inner parts of rotation curves are present .",
    "table [ appendix1 ] ( column 8) presents the results of the rotation curve quality assessments .",
    "the main assumption necessary to derive a rotation curve from the observed velocity field is that rotation motions are dominant and non circular motions are not part of a large - scale pattern .",
    "thus , by construction , a rotation curve provides a measurement , for each radius , of the axi - symmetric component of the gravitational potential well of the galaxy . by consequence , if the motions in the galaxy disk are purely circular , the receding and the approaching sides of a rotation curve should match and the residual velocity field should not display any structure .",
    "once the parameters of the rotation curves are properly computed by minimizing the velocity dispersion in the residual velocity field ( epinat et al .",
    "2008 ) , the remaining residuals are the signature of non - circular motions in or out the plane of the disk ( e. g. bars , oval distortions , spiral arms , local inflows and outflows , warps ) , including the intrinsic turbulences of the gas . to quantify the effects of these non - circular motions on the tully - fisher relations we have computed , for each galaxy , two indicators .",
    "the first one is based on the asymmetries between both sides of the rotation curves , it quantifies the mean difference of amplitude between the receding and approaching sides of the rotation curve . for each ring centered on the galaxy center ,",
    "the weighted ( absolute ) velocity difference between both sides is computed .",
    "the weight is provided by the number of bins in each ring .",
    "each bin is an independent velocity measurement on the velocity field , it may be constituted by @xmath1150 pixels for low signal - to - noise region of the galaxy .",
    "depending of the spatial resolution , each ring contains from two to several hundreds bins . due to the fact that their radius are smaller ,",
    "the central rings contains a number of pixels lower than the outer ones , their weights is thus smaller .",
    "the second indicator is based on the mean velocity dispersion extracted from the residual velocity field .",
    "this parameter is quantified by computing the average local velocity dispersion on the whole residual velocity field .",
    "to not overestimate the weight of non circular motion in slowly rotating systems with respect to high rotators , both indicators have been normalized by the maximum rotation velocity .",
    "we found that both indicators show the same trend on the tully - fisher relation , thus we will only illustrate the results using the indicator related to the asymmetries in the rotation curve .",
    "we computed the near - infrared magnitudes using 2mass data ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2mass h and k - band data were available for 83 galaxies of the ghasp sub - sample defined in section  2.1 .",
    "absolute magnitudes were obtained using :    @xmath12    distances ( _ d _ ) were taken from epinat et al .",
    "( 2008b ) .",
    "they are computed from the systemic velocities ( from the ned database ) corrected from virgo infall and assuming h@xmath13=75 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , except when accurate distance measurements where available ( references are listed in epinat et al .",
    "the magnitudes m@xmath14 have been computed using the flux within the isophote of 20 mag arcsec@xmath5 ( where uncertainties were taken from 2mass ) .",
    "we corrected the magnitude for galactic extinction using the schlegel maps ( schlegel et al .",
    "k - corrections ( k@xmath14 ) , extinction due to the inclinations ( a@xmath14 ) and seeing were applied using the method given in masters et al .",
    "columns 1 , 2 and 3 in table [ appendix1 ] list the name , h and k - band absolute magnitudes for the sample .",
    "k - band luminosities were estimated using l@xmath15=10@xmath16 , where the k - band absolute solar magnitude of 3.41 was taken from allen ( 1973 ) .    given the homogeneity of the _ sloan digital sky",
    "( _ sdss _ ) , g and r - band optical magnitudes were extracted from this database .",
    "moreover , most of the mass - to - light ratio recipes use b - v colors as an input parameter .",
    "for this reason , we have converted g and r - band data into b and v - band magnitudes by using the recipes given in lupton ( 2000 ) .",
    "we have extracted the optical size for each galaxy from the _ sdss_. in this case , we used the parameter isoa ( in the r - band ) , which corresponds to the diameter of the isophote where the disk surface brightness profile drops to 25 mag arcsec@xmath17 .",
    "these values were converted in radii ( in kpc ) by using the distance to each galaxy .    in order to compute the mass - to - light ratio for ghasp galaxies ,",
    "g - r colors were corrected by galactic extinction using the values given in the _ sdss _ database and then converted into b - v colors .",
    "_ sdss _ colors were available for 45 galaxies from which we removed five objects for which their magnitudes and optical radius are obviously incorrect ( compared with the optical radius , and magnitudes , given in hyperleda ) . for other six galaxies , there were no radius measurement .",
    "all the analysis including the radius of the galaxies were thus performed with 34 objects .",
    "b - band luminosities were estimated by using l@xmath18=10@xmath19 , where the b - band absolute solar magnitude of 5.48 was taken from binney & merrifield ( 1998 ) .      the main uncertainty in the study of the stellar and baryonic tully - fisher relations states in the stellar mass - to - light disk ratio @xmath20 .",
    "two main methods to estimate this parameter are used .",
    "spano et al . (",
    "2008 ) have modeled the stellar mass distribution of rotation curves , by scaling the r - band surface brightness profile to the rotation curve , obtaining an estimation of @xmath20 .",
    "bell & de jong ( 2001 ) have used stellar populations synthesis models to predict a relation between the colors of galaxies and their @xmath20 .",
    "although both approaches attempt to compute the same physical parameter , several authors have shown that surprisingly there seems to be no clear correlation between the @xmath20 obtained from these two methods ( e.g. barnes et al .",
    "other authors have invoked the modified newton dynamics ( mond ) to obtain the @xmath20 and study its implication on the baryonic tully - fisher relation ( mcgaugh 2005 ) . in this work , we have estimated @xmath20 and stellar masses using stellar population synthesis models recipes .",
    "one of them consists of simply fixing the value of @xmath20 .",

    "we have converted _ sdss _ g - r colors into b - v colors to obtain the @xmath20 parameter by using the recipes listed above .",

    "this band is more likely to be reflective of the stellar mass of galaxies . in order to compare stellar masses derived from the k - band luminosities ,",

    "we removed from this analysis galaxies for which no _ sdss _ colors were available in the literature .",

    "k - band luminosities were estimated using l@xmath15=10@xmath16 ( see section 2.2 ) .",

    "although almost the whole baryonic mass is approximately within the optical radius , the total dark matter content is not , thus we compute the dynamical total mass only within the optical radius .",
    "to estimate the total dynamical mass , we assumed the mass has a spherical distribution , which is likely the case for the dark halo component , as supported by observations ( e.g. ibata et al .",
    "2001 ) and n - body simulations ( e.g. kazantzidis et al .",

    "<S> by combining these data with 2mass photometry , optical colors , hi masses and different mass - to - light ratio estimators , we found a slope of 4.48@xmath00.38 and 3.64@xmath00.28 for the stellar and baryonic tully - fisher relation , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we found that these values do not change significantly when different mass - to - light ratios recipes were used . </S>",
    "<S> we also point out , for the first time , that rising rotation curves as well as asymmetric rotation curves show a larger dispersion in the tully - fisher relation than flat ones or than symmetric ones . using the baryonic mass and the optical radius of galaxies </S>",
    "<S> , we found that the surface baryonic mass density is almost constant for all the galaxies of this sample . in this study </S>",
    "<S> we also emphasize the presence of a break in the nir tully - fisher relation at m@xmath120 and we confirm that late - type galaxies present higher total - to - baryonic mass ratios than early - type spirals , suggesting that supernova feedback is actually an important issue in late - type spirals . due to the well defined sample selection criteria and the homogeneity of the data analysis , the tully - fisher relation for ghasp galaxies can be used as a reference for the study of this relation in other environments and at higher redshifts .    </S>",
