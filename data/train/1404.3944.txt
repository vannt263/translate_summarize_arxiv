    "the central question in the mathematical study of population genetics is to understand how gene frequencies vary in time .",
    "this topic has a long history , since at least the works of wright and fisher  @xcite .",
    "a simpler model was introduced by moran  @xcite : in that case a population of constant size @xmath0 of two types evolves in discrete time steps . to each type",
    "we attribute a positive number , called fitness . at each time",
    "one individual is selected to reproduce with probability proportional to its fitness and one to die ( possibly the same one ) , with probability @xmath1 .",
    "the so called moran process continues until the entire population consists of individuals at a given type .",
    "we say that one type has _ fixated _ while the other has become _ extinct_. one particularly important question is the fixation probability of a given type @xmath2 , i.e. , the probability that after a sufficiently long time , type @xmath2reaches fixation ; see  @xcite    the moran process is a particular case of the so called _ birth - death ( bd ) processes with selection on the birth_. birth - death process are a particular case of stochastic process in which the number of individuals of a given type varies at most one per time step , i.e. , transitions are allowed only between neighboring sites in an appropriate topology .",
    "the `` selection at birth '' indicates that the removed individual was selected using an equally distributed random variable , while the random variable indicating selection for reproduction is not necessarily identically distributed among all individuals .",
    "see , e.g. ,  @xcite for further informations on bd processes .    in  @xcite , topology , in the form of a graph ,",
    "was introduced in the study of population dynamics .",
    "individuals were represented by vertices , while edges represented possible positions for the offspring of individuals in a given vertex . in particular , consider a generic graph where all vertices but one ( selected at random ) are occupied by a type with fitness 1 ( the resident type ) .",
    "the remaining vertex is occupied by a mutant with fitness @xmath3 . after a certain fixed time , one of the individuals ( resident or mutant )",
    "is selected to reproduce with probability proportional to fitness , and its offspring replaces one of the individuals occupying an adjacent vertex , selected with equal probability .",
    "this is the so called moran process on graphs  @xcite .",
    "the invasion probability @xmath4 is given by the probability that after a sufficiently long time all vertices are occupied by the mutant type ( i.e. , the mutant has fixed and the resident has become extinct ) . for a complete graph ( all pairs of vertices",
    "are connected ) with @xmath0 vertices , the invasion probability is given by @xmath5 if @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this corresponds to the original problem studied in  @xcite .",
    "we say that a graph is an accelerator of evolution if @xmath8 if and only if @xmath9 .",
    "if one of these inequalities is reversed , we say that the graph is a suppressor of evolution .",
    "see  @xcite for a more detailed explanation of concepts used in this article and also for examples of accelerators and suppressors of evolution .    in this article",
    ", we study a specific graph , called the `` star '' .",
    "the star is a graph with @xmath10 vertices , labeled from 0 to @xmath0 , where vertex number 0 is called the _ center _ and all the others are the _",
    "leaves_. the only edges are between vertex 0 and all other vertices .",
    "these edges are bidirectional , see figure  [ fig ] . in  @xcite",
    ", the star graph was introduced as a particular case of a family of graphs , called the `` superstar '' and parameterized by two natural numbers : @xmath11 , the number of layers and @xmath0 , the number of vertices at layer @xmath12 , for any @xmath13 , connected to any given vertex at layer @xmath14 .",
    "the first layer has a single vertex , called the _",
    "center_. the star corresponds to @xmath15 . according to the conjecture in  @xcite , @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "however , recently  @xcite showed that this conjecture is false for @xmath18 .",
    "we start this article from a previous work ( see  @xcite ) , where an explicit formula for the invasion probability in stars was derived and study the associated asymptotic expression when @xmath0 , the number of individuals , is large .",
    "the aim of this work is to show that the expression for the leading term for @xmath17 and fixed @xmath19 in the asymptotic expression of the invasion probability is given by @xmath20 a precise definition of @xmath21 as the leading term of the exact expression in @xmath17 and fixed @xmath19 is given in eq .",

    "equivalently , this result can be proved from eq .",

    "a similar result is valid for a large class of graphs ; in particular , it is valid for graphs with at most one _ root _ ( a root is a vertex with no edge leading to it ) .",
    "however , a single mutant can not invade a graph with two or more roots , and , in this case , the invasion probability is equal to zero .",

    "we initially see that @xmath42 on the other hand @xmath43 taking the limit @xmath17 , we find @xmath44 finally , we write @xmath45 and taking the limit @xmath17 , we conclude that @xmath46 for @xmath0 large enough @xmath40 if and only if @xmath9 .",
    "despite the fact that the expression conjectured in  @xcite is wrong for @xmath15 and @xmath18 , it has been widely used ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",

    "see also  @xcite for a review of evolutionary graph theory .",
    "differences between expression  ( [ estrela_assintotica ] ) and the expression @xmath48 given by  @xcite and  @xcite are hardly noticeable from the numerical point of view .",
    "in fact , for @xmath9 , the difference between both expressions are exponentially small , as @xmath49 exponentially fast when @xmath17 .",
