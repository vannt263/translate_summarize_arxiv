    "the map @xmath76 is a homotopy equivalence for @xmath62 or @xmath3 , and in general is @xmath77-connected@xcite .",

    "as noted in the introduction , the set @xmath22 of framed bordism classes of framed links in @xmath1 is an abelian group under the operation of disjoint union .",

    "this leads to the formula in theorem 3 for the stabilizer of the @xmath51$]-action and hence completes our proof .",
