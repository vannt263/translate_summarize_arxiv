    "any possible deviation for the @xmath1from the freeze - out systematics extracted from the combined fit to the @xmath83 , @xmath84  and @xmath0   spectra can only be inferred from the integrated information of the @xmath1  spectrum , i.e. from its inverse slope . in figure",

    "since the inverse slope is a function of the @xmath90   range where the fit is performed , we have also computed the blast - wave inverse slopes of @xmath83 , @xmath91 , @xmath0  and @xmath1   spectra in the @xmath90  ranges of na57 ( closed circles ) .",
    "the measured values of the inverse slope of the @xmath1  appear to deviate from the trend of the other strange particles .    at 40 @xmath2",
    "gev/@xmath3  the same analysis suggests an early decoupling even of the @xmath0  with respect to the singly strange particles ( see figure  [ fig : blastpred ] ) .      in figure",
    "[ fig : cont_msd ] we show the @xmath92  confidence level contours for each of the five centrality classes defined in table  [ tab : centrality ] .",
    "the observed trend is as follows : the more central the collisions the larger the transverse collective flow and the lower the final thermal freeze - out temperature .",
    "higher freeze - out temperatures for more peripheral collisions may be interpreted as the result of an earlier decoupling of the expanding system . therefore , when trying to describe hydro - dynamically the experimental data measured for peripheral or semi - central collisions , one should employ higher values of the freeze - out temperature than the 120 mev measured for central collisions .",
    "indeed , in reference  @xcite the measured elliptic flow for pb - pb at 158 @xmath2  gev/@xmath3  in the centrality range @xmath93  is close to that obtained with a hydro - dynamical evolution terminated at @xmath94  mev . in the range",
    "@xmath95   we measure @xmath96  mev .",
    "the analysis of the transverse mass spectra of strange particles in pb - pb collisions at sps energies suggests that after a central collision the system expands explosively and then it freezes - out when the temperature is of the order of 120 mev , with an average transverse flow velocity of about one half of the speed of light .",
    "similar transverse flow velocities are measured at 40 and 158 @xmath2  gev/@xmath3   but the freeze - out temperature is lower at the lower energy .",
    "the inverse slopes of multi - strange particles ( @xmath1  at 158 @xmath2  gev/@xmath3 , @xmath0  and @xmath1  at 40 @xmath2  gev/@xmath3 ) appear to deviate from the values predicted by the blast - wave model tuned on singly - strange particles ( ,  and ) .",
    "finally , the results on the centrality dependence of the expansion dynamics indicate that with increasing centrality the transverse flow velocity increases and the freeze - out temperature decreases .",
