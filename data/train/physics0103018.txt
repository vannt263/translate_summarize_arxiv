    "many physical and biological systems exhibit complex behavior characterized by long - range power - law correlations .",
    "traditional approaches such as the power - spectrum and correlation analysis are not suited to accurately quantify long - range correlations in non - stationary signals  e.g. signals exhibiting fluctuations along polynomial trends . detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa)@xcite is a scaling analysis method providing a simple quantitative parameter  the scaling exponent @xmath0  to represent the correlation properties of a signal .",
    "the advantages of dfa over many methods are that it permits the detection of long - range correlations embedded in seemingly non - stationary time series , and also avoids the spurious detection of apparent long - range correlations that are artifact of non - stationarity . in the past few years , more than 100 publications have utilized the dfa as method of correlation analysis , and have uncovered long - range power - law correlations in many research fields such as cardiac dynamics@xcite , bioinformatics@xcite , economics@xcite , meteorology@xcite , geology@xcite , ethology@xcite etc .",
    "furthermore , the dfa method may help identify different states of the same system according to its different scaling behaviors  e.g. the scaling exponent @xmath0 for heart inter - beat intervals is different for healthy and sick individuals@xcite .",
    "the correct interpretation of the scaling results obtained by the dfa method is crucial for understanding the intrinsic dynamics of the systems under study .",
    "in fact , for all systems where the dfa method was applied , there are many issues that remain unexplained .",
    "one of the common challenges is that the correlation exponent is not always a constant ( independent of scale ) and crossovers often exist  i.e. change of the scaling exponent @xmath0 for different range of scales@xcite .",
    "a crossover usually can arise from a change in the correlation properties of the signal at different time or space scales , or can often arise from trends in the data . in this paper , we systematically study how different types of trends affect the apparent scaling behavior of long - range correlated signals .",
    "the existence of trends in times series generated by physical or biological systems is so common that it is almost unavoidable .",
    "for example , the number of particles emitted by a radiation source in an unit time has a trend of decreasing because the source becomes weaker@xcite ; the density of air due to gravity has a trend at different altitude @xcite ; the air temperature in different geographic locations and the water flow of rivers have a periodic trend due to seasonal changes@xcite ; the occurrence rate of earthquakes in certain area has trend in different time period@xcite .",
    "an immediate problem facing researchers applying scaling analysis to time series is whether trends in data arise from external conditions , having little to do with the intrinsic dynamics of the system generating noisy fluctuating data . in this case ,",
    "a possible approach is to first recognize and filter out the trends before we attempt to quantify correlations in the noise .",
    "alternatively , trends may arise from the intrinsic dynamics of the system , rather than being an epiphenomenon of external conditions , and thus may be correlated with the noisy fluctuations generated by the system . in this case , careful considerations should be given if trends should be filtered out when estimating correlations in the noise , since such `` intrinsic '' trends may be related to the local properties of the noisy fluctuations .",
    "here we study the origin and the properties of crossovers in the scaling behavior of noisy signals , by applying the dfa method first on correlated noise and then on noise with trends , and comparing the difference in the scaling results . to this end , we generate artificial time series  anticorrelated , white and correlated noise with standard deviation equal to one  using the modified fourier filtering method introduced by makse et al.@xcite .",
    "we consider the case when the trend is independent of the local properties of the noise ( external trend ) .",
    "we find that the scaling behavior of noise with a trend is a superposition of the scaling of the noise and the apparent scaling of the trend , and we derive analytical relations based on the dfa , which we call `` superposition rule '' .",
    "we show how this `` superposition rule '' can be used to determine if the trends are independent of the noisy fluctuation in real data , and if filtering these trends out will no affect the scaling properties of the data .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec.[secdfa ] , we review the algorithm of the dfa method , and in appendix [ secpuren ] we compare the performance of the dfa with the classical scaling analysis hurst s analysis ( r / s analysis) and show that the dfa is a superior method to quantify the scaling behavior of noisy signals . in sec .",

    "[ secsin ] , we study a periodic trend , and in sec .",
    "[ seclc ] the effect of power - law trend .",
    "we systematically study all resulting crossovers , their conditions of existence and their typical characteristics associated with the different types of trends .",
    "in addition , we also show how to use dfa appropriately to minimize or even eliminate the effects of those trends in cases that trends are not choices of the study , that is , trends do not reflect the dynamics of the system but are caused by some `` irrelevant '' background . finally , sec .",
    "[ seccon ] contains a summary .",
    "to illustrate the dfa method , we consider a noisy time series , @xmath1 ( @xmath2  ) . we integrate the time series @xmath1 , @xmath3 where @xmath4 and is divided into boxes of equal size , @xmath5 . in each box",

    "we detrend the integrated time series , @xmath10 by subtracting the local trend @xmath6 in each box , and we calculate the detrended fluctuation function @xmath11 for a given box size @xmath5 , we calculate the root mean square ( rms ) fluctuation @xmath12 ^ 2 } \\label{f}\\ ] ] the above computation is repeated for box sizes @xmath5 ( different scales ) to provide a relationship between @xmath13 and @xmath5 . a power - law relation between @xmath13 and the box size",
    "@xmath5 indicates the presence of scaling : @xmath14 .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 , called the scaling exponent or correlation exponent , represents the correlation properties of the signal : if @xmath15 , there is no correlation and the signal is an uncorrelated signal ( white noise ) ; if @xmath16 , the signal is anticorrelated ; if @xmath17 , there are positive correlations in the signal .",
    "first we consider the simplest case : correlated noise with a linear trend .",
    "a linear trend @xmath18 is characterized by only one variable  the slope of the trend , @xmath19 . for convenience ,",
    "we denote the rms fluctuation function for noise without trends by @xmath20 , linear trends by @xmath21 , and noise with a linear trend by @xmath22 .      using the algorithm of makse@xcite ,",
    "we generate correlated noise with standard deviation one , with a given correlation property characterized by a given scaling exponent @xmath0 .",
    "we apply dfa-1 to quantify the correlation properties of the noise and find that only in certain good fit region the rms fluctuation function @xmath20 can be approximated by a power - law function [ see appendix [ secpuren ] ] @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a parameter independent of the scale @xmath5 .",
    "we find that the good fit region depends on the correlation exponent @xmath0 [ see appendix [ secpuren ] ] .",
    "we also derive analytically the rms fluctuation function for linear trend only for dfa-1 and find that [ see appendix [ secdfa1l ] ] @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a constant independent of the length of trend @xmath27 , of the box size @xmath5 and of the slope of the trend @xmath19 .",
    "we obtain @xmath28 .",
    "next we apply the dfa-1 method to the superposition of a linear trend with correlated noise and we compare the rms fluctuation function @xmath29 with @xmath20 [ see fig.[dfa1_npbl_r_a01n17 ] ] .",
    "we observe a crossover in @xmath22 at scale @xmath30 . for @xmath31 ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath29 is very close to the behavior of @xmath20 , while for @xmath32 , the behavior of @xmath29 is very close to the behavior of @xmath21 .",
    "a similar crossover behavior is also observed in the scaling of the well - studied biased random walk @xcite .",
    "it is known that the crossover in the biased random walk is due to the competition of the unbiased random walk and the bias [ see fig.5.3 of @xcite ] .",

    "these relations between the detrended fluctuation functions @xmath39 at different time scales @xmath5 explain the crossover in the scaling behavior of @xmath29 : from very close to @xmath20 to very close to @xmath21 ( observed in fig.[dfa1_npbl_r_a01n17 ] ) .",

    "we call this relation the `` superposition rule '' .",
    "this rule helps us understand how the competition between the contribution of the noise and the trend to the rms fluctuation function @xmath29 at different scales @xmath5 leads to appearance of crossovers @xcite .",
    "next , we ask how the crossover scale @xmath41 depends on : ( i ) the slope of the linear trend @xmath19 , ( ii ) the scaling exponent @xmath0 of the noise , and ( iii ) the length of the signal @xmath27 .",

    "[ technique](a ) and [ technique](b ) and by tables  [ tahaft ] and [ tadfa1 ft ] .",
    "it is very important to know the best fitting region of dfa and r / s analysis in the study of real signals .",
    "otherwise , the wrong @xmath0 will be obtained if an inappropriate region is selected .    in order to find the best region ,",
    "we first determine the dependence of the locally estimated @xmath0 , @xmath47 , on the scale @xmath5 .",
    "first , generate a standard noise with given scaling exponent @xmath0 ; then calculate @xmath13 ( or @xmath46 ) , and obtain @xmath48 by local fitting of @xmath13 ( or @xmath46 ) .",
    "same random simulation is repeated 50 times for both dfa and r / s analysis .",
    "the resultant average @xmath49 , respectively , are illustrated in fig.[slope_n ] for dfa-1 and r / s analysis .",
    "if a scaling analysis method is working properly , then the result @xmath48 from simulation with @xmath0 would be a horizontal line with slight fluctuation centered about @xmath50 .",
    "note from fig.[slope_n ] that such a _ horizontal behavior _ does not hold for all the scales @xmath5 but for a certain range from @xmath51 to @xmath52 .",
    "in addition , at small scale , r / s analysis gives @xmath53 if @xmath54 and @xmath55 if @xmath56 , which has been pointed out by mandelbrot@xcite while dfa gives @xmath53 if @xmath57 and @xmath55 if @xmath58",
    ".    it is clear that the smaller the @xmath51 and the larger the @xmath52 , the better the method .",
    "we also perceive that the expected _ horizontal behavior _ stops because the fluctuations become larger due to the under - sampling of @xmath13 or @xmath46 when @xmath5 gets closer to the length of the signal @xmath59 .",
    "furthermore , it can be seen from fig.[slope_n ] that @xmath60 independent of @xmath0 ( if the best fit region exists ) , which is why one tenth of the signal length is the maximum box size when using dfa or r / s analysis .",

    "dfa works better since @xmath51 is quite small for @xmath63 correlated signals .",
    "one problem remains for dfa , @xmath51 for small @xmath0 ( @xmath64 ) is still too large comparing to those for large @xmath0(@xmath65 ) .",
    "we can improve it by applying dfa on the integration of the noise with @xmath66 .",
    "the resultant new expected @xmath67 for the integrated signal would be @xmath68 , while the @xmath51 for the integrated signal becomes much smaller as shown also in fig.[smin](shading area @xmath69 ) .",
    "therefore , for a noise with @xmath16 , it is best to estimate the scaling exponent @xmath67 of the integrated signal first and then obtain @xmath0 by @xmath70 .",
    "this is what we did in the following sections to those anticorrelated signals .",
