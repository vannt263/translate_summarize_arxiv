    "the tdpes shows ( i ) a diabatic shape in the vicinity of an avoided crossing , smoothly connecting the bo pess involved in the process , and ( ii ) dynamical steps bridging piecewise adiabatic shapes , far from the avoided crossing . in particular , the steps of the tdpes have been related to the spatial splitting of the ( exact ) nuclear wavefunction , which reproduces the dynamics of bo wavefunctions branching in different adiabatic states .",
    "furthermore , we have employed these observations to investigate the suitability of the ( quasi)classical treatment  @xcite of nuclear dynamics in situations where the electronic effect can be taken into account exactly , with the aim of proposing trajectory - based approximation schemes  @xcite to the quantum - mechanical problem .    in the present work ,",

    "the aim of this study is to translate the properties usually observed in the bo framework to the language of the ef and , from this , to understand the key features to be accounted for when developing approximations to the coupled electron - nuclear quantum dynamics .",
    "the reason to focus on the tdpes is that it represents the very ( and only , when the vector potential can be gauged away ) quantity driving the nuclear dynamics , and all its features are intimately related to the features of the nuclear wavefunction . in order to study quantum interferences , we construct a situation where two bo nuclear wavefunctions , associated to different adiabatic states , meet at an avoided crossing .",
    "the bo wavefunctions reach the nonadiabatic region after having evolved on different paths , thus the recombination patterns might be strongly affected by the different histories .",
    "one of the questions addressed in this work is : can such recombination patterns , i.e. , nonadiabatic quantum interferences , be identified in the tdpes ?",
    "the importance of capturing the recombination process imposes that the analysis shall focus on the nonadiabatic region , by contrast to previous analysis  @xcite that has instead mainly placed the attention on the tdpes far from an avoided crossing .",

    "we stress that this work should be regarded as an exploratory study , rather than as the development of an actual numerical procedure .",
    "it should be borne in mind that quantum - classical approaches are powerful tools to investigate the coupled dynamics of electrons and nuclei in complex ( and large ) molecular systems  for which a fully quantum - mechanical description is prohibitively expensive . however , introducing a classical approximation for selected nuclear degrees of freedom might come at the price of missing some features of the dynamics such as nonadiabatic quantum interferences , whose importance has not been considered in previous work on the exact factorization .",
    "the analysis proposed here identifies such quantum features in the tdpes , and it furthermore generalizes the use of a quantum - classical dynamics based on the exact factorization for nonadiabatic quantum interferences .    in answering the first question above , related to the appearance of interferences in the tdpes , we have pointed out the importance of focusing the analysis in the nonadiabatic coupling region . in this region , bo wavefunctions with different histories recombine and",
    "effects connected to their relative phases become evident in the tdpes .",
    "we have observed , in fact , the appearance of an oscillatory behavior of the tdpes that initiates during the nonadiabatic event .",
    "we have rationalized such behavior with a simplified model that allowed us to control the phase relation between the incoming bo wavefunctions and to tune the oscillations in the tdpes .",
    "surprisingly , the answer to the second question is that classical trajectories evolved on the exact tdpes are able to reproduce rather well the quantum probability distribution at all times even in the case when quantum interferences appear .",
    "this test proves once again that the tdpes is a powerful tool to drive nuclear dynamics in nonadiabatic conditions , and thus confirms the importance of developing accurate approximation schemes to compute it in general cases .",
    "more generally , this study opens interesting questions related to the bo and the exact factorization framework .",
    "the question often arose in the literature as to whether or not newtonian ( classical ) trajectories are an efficient tool to mimic quantum nuclear dynamics in nonadiabatic conditions ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for examples ) . from a bo perspective , nonadiabatic regions are the heart of the problem , due to the fact that nonadiabatic couplings are present in the ( a priori infinite ) coupled evolution equations for the bo wavefunctions . in this framework , we might argue that such involved nuclear evolution equations compensate the rather simple time - independent electronic problem .",
    "when the same situation is analyzed from the exact factorization perspective , the complexity of the coupled electron - nuclear problem is somehow shifted towards the electronic problem and towards the calculation of the tdpes ( and , when necessary , of the time - dependent vector potential ) . at the cost of introducing an actual time - dependence in the electronic wavefunction ,",
    "the nuclear equation becomes a standard time - dependent schrdinger equation , which can be approximated in terms of newtonian trajectories .",
    "providing accurate approximations to the tdpes might nevertheless be a hard task , and we shall resort in compromising between the simplification of the nuclear dynamics and the solution of the electronic problem ( see for instance the idea of using coupled trajectories  @xcite to solve the nuclear equation of the exact factorization ) . still , developing methods that play with distributing the electron - nuclear coupling complexity between the electronic and the nuclear problem in the context of the exact factorization is an open subject , reinforced by a better understanding of the exact factorization quantities as done in the present work .",
    "in some of the situations studied above , the tdpes presents a more complex structure than previous observations  @xcite have pointed out and interpreted . when quantum interferences ( as defined in sec .  [ interference ] )",
    "are observed , oscillations in the gauge - invariant components of the tdpes seem to appear ( in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for the case @xmath96  a.u . ) at and after the passage of the nuclear wavefunction through the coupling region .",
    "the aim of this appendix is to rationalize the appearance of these oscillations and to relate them to the relative phases of different bo nuclear wavefunctions , suggesting in this way a connection between the bo and the ef frameworks . to this end , we construct a model that allows us to control the relative phases and to directly relate them to changes in the ( exact ) nuclear density and in the tdpes .",
    "comparisons with the iwa applied to the model will be also discussed .",
    "below , we will first introduce the model , and we will then discuss the properties of the tdpes .",
