    "studying maser lines is useful in order to explore the physical and chemical conditions in interstellar gas .",
    "maser pumping occurs under specific conditions , and modeling of the maser formation can provide estimates of the required environmental parameters . if more than one transition can be observed at the same location , predictions of line ratios can be used to place tight constraints on the physical conditions .",
    "a suitable species for studies is therefore the methanol ( ch@xmath4oh ) molecule , which displays several maser transitions that can be found in the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "methanol masers were first discovered by @xcite at frequencies around 25  ghz near orion . since then , methanol maser emission has been discovered in hundreds of star forming regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as originally suggested by @xcite , and later labelled by @xcite , methanol masers are divided into two classes which depend on their pumping mechanism .",
    "class i methanol masers are collisionally pumped , whereas the class ii masers are pumped by radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "both classes can be found associated with massive star forming regions ( sfrs ) .",
    "consistent with the pumping classification , class ii methanol masers are typically located close to the protostars , often associated with uc and hc hii regions , while the class i masers instead are related to outflows and molecular shock fronts ( @xcite ) .",
    "masers are not only excited in sfrs but also in regions shocked by supernova remnants ( snrs ) . for instance",
    ", the collisionally pumped 1720  mhz  oh masers are associated with the interaction regions between snrs and molecular clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a comparison of the oh and methanol molecule excitation mechanism indicates that conditions conducive for 1720 mhz oh masers may also be favorable for class i methanol masers @xcite .",
    "based on these results it would not be unreasonable to expect methanol masers to occur near snrs that sustain oh masers .",
    "consistent with this prediction , 36  ghz and 44  ghz methanol masers have been found near the snr sgraeast in the galactic center region ( @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , in a recent study by @xcite , the same methanol transitions were discovered toward the snrs g1.4@xmath90.1 and w28 .",
    "these three snrs all harbor oh masers , and therefore readily provide a testbed for combined modeling with observations of several maser species to determine local densities and density gradients",
    ". constraining density estimates in these interaction regions may be of interest for , e.g. , modeling of cosmic ray acceleration in snrs .",
    "such models estimate the expected resulting @xmath10-ray emission due to neutral pion decay , which is a function of the number density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper , modeling of the methanol maser transitions",
    "is used to predict under what physical conditions masers will occur , specific to a snr environment .",
    "these results are used to interpret recent observational results on methanol masers near snrs .",
    "given that methanol typically has been searched for and found associated with hot dense cores of newly forming massive stars @xcite , most theoretical work on the methanol molecule and its excitation has been focused on conditions in sfrs and class  ii masers .",
    "for the class  i masers , an early statistical equilibrium calculation for the 36  ghz and 44  ghz lines detected in sgrb2 showed that high kinetic temperatures were required for maser action @xcite .",
    "later , more detailed modeling of the general behaviour of both class  i and ii masers were performed by @xcite .",
    "their work concluded that the brightest collisionally pumped class  i methanol masers are expected at the transitions at 36.169  ghz ( @xmath11 ) and 44.070  ghz ( @xmath12 ) , with slightly weaker masers for the 84.521  ghz ( @xmath13 ) and 95.169  ghz ( @xmath14 ) transitions .",
    "these four transitions have been observed associated with outflows in sfrs ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in snrs , the 84",
    "ghz line has not yet been reported , but the 36  ghz , 44  ghz , and 95  ghz lines have all been detected @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of these lines , and the relative line intensities for spatially coincident emission allows the physical conditions of the gas to be probed .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the conditions regulating maser activity near snrs .",
    "this environment includes radiation due to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , and a dust generated radiation field that is weaker than in sfrs .",
    "the optical depths of the four class i transitions were calculated using the molpop - cep program @xcite .",
    "molpop - cep is a fortran 90 code that solves the molecular level population equations along with the radiative transfer equations for multi - level systems .",
    "it applies either the coupled escape probability ( cep ) method outlined in @xcite or the standard escape probability approximation for a homogeneous slab .    in order to calculate the masing conditions in molpop - cep ,",
    "several variables can be adjusted .",
    "these include the number of energy levels considered , the kinetic gas temperature ( @xmath15 ) , the molecular hydrogen density ( @xmath16 ) , the fractional abundance of a trace molecule ( @xmath17 , here methanol ) , and radiation fields due to dust and the cmb .",
    "snr dust temperatures are estimated to be approximately between 20 - 80  k ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but a change within this modest range of dust temperatures does not significantly affect our model results . an external radiation field of 2.725  k from the cmb and a 30  k dust radiation field is therefore applied in each model presented here .",
    "energy levels for the methanol molecule were incorporated using the leiden atomic and molecular database ( lamda)moldata/ ] , which includes close to 300 rotational energy levels for each of the a- and e - type species in the torsional ground state up to about 350 @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) @xcite .",
    "the collision rate coefficients used for methanol colliding with h@xmath20 were also adopted from lamda , originally calculated by @xcite for temperatures ranging from 5 to 200  k. since methanol masers are predicted to be excited under similar , though not identical , conditions as the oh masers , the initial input parameters to the models were those optimally producing 1720 mhz oh maser emission in snrs : @xmath21  @xmath6 and @xmath22  k @xcite .",

    "to determine the full range of conditions under which masing occurs for each transition , different combinations of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 were modeled .",
    "the models covered a temperature range of 20 to 200  k , a density range of 10 to 10@xmath30 @xmath6 , and a fraction range of 10@xmath31 to 10@xmath32 .",
    "even though @xmath17 was varied in the calculations , this value only affects the absolute value of the optical depth , and does not alter the range of temperatures and densities under which masers form .",
    "a value of @xmath33 is therefore used in the remainder of this paper .",
    "all parameters were varied successively by factors of 10 , covering an extensive combination of parameters . the number of transitions involved in the calculations can also be varied , but this has no significant effect on our modeling outcome since the conditions modeled here predominantly affect the lower energy transitions only .    for oh maser",
    "excitation , line overlap is an important factor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may drastically change the relative excitation population of the oh main line masers @xcite .",
    "line overlap in methanol is expected to be much less important , as has been previously confirmed through modeling by @xcite and @xcite . due to the dominant collisional excitation mechanism in snrs , only small changes in the resulting calculated emission",
    "would be expected due to ir line overlap given the weak dust radiation field of 30k .",
    "in fact , using line overlap for a linewidth of 1  kms@xmath34 causes a slight shift of the peak optical depth to higher column densities by a factor of @xmath35 or less .",
    "no other major differences in our modeling output are found , in agreement with the earlier modeling of methanol masers in sfrs . in the description of the results below , line overlaps are excluded .    varying the main parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 results in a wide set of optical depths , summarized in table 1 .",
    "the values in table 1 emphasize the broad range of conditions under which the methanol maser may be formed .",
    "the lower energy level transitions at 36  ghz and 44  ghz typically show more significant optical depths compared to 84  ghz and 95  ghz .",
    "an example of this general behavior can been seen in fig.1 which shows the inverted optical depths ( i.e. , @xmath36 ) at a specific set of conditions ( @xmath21  @xmath6 and @xmath37  k ) .",
    "figure 2 demonstrates how the peak inverted optical depth increases with density between @xmath38@xmath6 , maximizes at @xmath39@xmath6 , and lastly decreases drastically above @xmath40@xmath6 .",
    "from the same plot it can also be noted that the @xmath41-type 44  ghz and 95  ghz transitions have the highest inverted optical depth at a density of @xmath42@xmath6 , while this occurs at a slightly higher density of @xmath43@xmath6 for the @xmath8-type 36  ghz and 84  ghz lines .",
    "consequently , the @xmath41-type transitions get quenched at a smaller density than the @xmath8-type transitions .",
    "these trends occur for each value of the temperature , and is clearly visible in fig.3 showing contour plots of the optical depth as a function of the h@xmath20 density and the methanol column density at two different temperatures .",
    "the 36  ghz and 84  ghz lines show optimal maser output at higher densities and at a slightly larger column density compared to the 44  ghz and 95  ghz lines respectively .",
    "this figure also shows that at higher temperatures , the peak densities approach each other , indicated by the cross and plus signs .",
    "the filled symbols represent @xmath41-type transitions and the open symbols represent @xmath8-type transitions .",
    "the @xmath8-type transitions have more significant optical depths compared to the @xmath41-type transitions at lower densities , and conversely at higher densities.,title=\"fig : \" ]        the temperature dependence is illustrated in fig.4 , using three different densities .",
    "overall , for a given density the optical depth increases with increasing temperature . however , there are parameter regions where the relative strength of the lines changes , which is an important observational diagnostic of the region . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath41-type transitions become quenched at lower densities than the @xmath8-type transitions , leaving strong masers at 36  ghz and 85  ghz at densities @xmath44@xmath6 . at lower densities",
    "the 44  ghz line will dominate . for more detailed diagnostic purposes , illustrating this behavior , the optical depth ratios with respect to the 44  ghz and 36  ghz lines at three different temperatures are plotted in fig.5 .",
    "typically , for @xmath45 @xmath6 , the brightest masers occur at 36  ghz and 44  ghz and therefore are most likely the most useful observational diagnostic for probing physical conditions in the observed region .",
    "optimal masing conditions at 36  ghz occurs at temperatures @xmath46 k and at densities between @xmath47 @xmath6 , while optimal conditions for the 44  ghz line are found at temperatures @xmath46  k and at slightly lower densities between @xmath48 @xmath6 . the large overlap in the density range for the two transitions suggests that 36  ghz and 44  ghz masers can be expected to be found co - spatially @xcite . if only 36  ghz masers are detected , the density is most likely too high for the formation of 44  ghz masers .",
    "if the two transitions are found jointly , their relative brightness may be used to constrain the density and temperature at that position ( see sect.[gc ] ) .",
    "@xcite mention the results of unpublished methanol maser modeling in sfrs suggesting that the 36 ghz transitions occur for gas temperatures that range from about 30@xmath9100  k and densities on the order of @xmath49 @xmath6 .",
    "the same unpublished modeling results reported for the 44  ghz transitions are found to occur at higher temperatures ( 80@xmath9200 k ) and densities ( @xmath50 @xmath6 ) .",
    "they predict that in sfrs the density trend is opposite to that of our modeling results in snrs , as we find that 44  ghz masers tend to occur at slightly lower densities than the 36  ghz masers .",
    "we note , however , that the unpublished @xcite results should be verified before being used in a detailed quantitative analysis .",
    "although 84  ghz and 95  ghz methanol masers have been detected in sfrs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , there are less details available for estimates of the density and temperature for these transitions @xcite .",
    "the results presented here show that these transitions may be found under the same range of conditions as the 36  ghz and 44  ghz lines .",
    "these higher frequency masers are generally less bright , but they still provide complimentary information about the interstellar conditions .      the broad range of conditions under which methanol masers can form encompasses those of the 1720 mhz oh maser line .",
    "this suggests that the methanol lines may be readily detectable near snrs , and perhaps especially near those harboring oh masers . in a targeted search towards a sample of 21 snrs displaying the 1720 mhz oh maser line , which may indicate a molecular - cloud interaction ,",
    "three snrs ( g1.4@xmath51 , w28 , and sgraeast ) were found to have 36  ghz and/or 44  ghz methanol masers @xcite . while the low number of sources detected in any of the methanol transitions were somewhat surprising , @xcite",
    "discuss some possible explanations .",
    "the most selective one is the small angular area covered in the search , due to the small field - of - view at those high frequencies .",
    "also the limited range in line - of - sight velocity may have played a role .",
    "alternatively , the methanol abundance or path - length may simply be insufficient for maser amplification . finally ,",
    "if the conditions across the pre - shock to post - shock regions changes significantly , the formation and destruction mechanisms of the different molecules could result in a significant spatial / angular and velocity offset between oh and methanol , and the search was targeting the oh maser positions specifically .",
    "nevertheless , for the three snrs with methanol maser emission , the nature of the masers and the gas conditions are discussed using the modeling results ( sect.[g1.4]-[gc ] ) .",
    "close to 40 methanol masers were detected in g1.4@xmath90.1 at 36 ghz .",
    "this snr is one of the smaller angular scale snrs observed by @xcite , which may have increased the chance of detection .",
    "however , most pointings contained several maser spots , indicating there may be more masers outside the pointing areas and that this snr may be particularly rich in methanol masers .",
    "consistent with this , g1.4@xmath90.1 is overlapping with two molecular clouds along the line of sight , as probed by both co and cs observations showing emission concentrated around @xmath52 and @xmath53 ^-1 kms@xmath34 for the two clouds respectively @xcite .",
    "given the close agreement of the co , cs , and 36  ghz methanol emission velocities it is therefore reasonable to assume the methanol maser emission is associated with gas in these clouds , presumably pumped by the interaction between the snr and the molecular clouds .",
    "the velocity of the g1.4@xmath90.1 oh maser is offset from the two main methanol velocities , perhaps because it arises in a region of the gas where the velocities have been disturbed on the post - shocked region @xcite . using the molpop - cep results ( sect.[results ] ) , regions where 36  ghz masers are much brighter than the 44  ghz transition correspond to high density and temperatures , @xmath54@xmath6 and @xmath55k ( fig.4 ) .",
    "the non detection of the 44  ghz masers can be used to further constrain the density and temperature , using the 36  ghz maser flux densities and rms sensitivity quoted in @xcite .",
    "the average flux density of the 36  ghz masers is 0.21 jybeam@xmath34 , and with a 10  mjy rms sensitivity a 3-@xmath56 detection limit on the 44  ghz masers would correspond to a minimum optical depth ratio of 7 . from fig.5 , this best corresponds to the peak region at @xmath57@xmath6 and @xmath58k .",
    "the presence of high density regimes in this source is confirmed by rich emission from both sio @xcite and nh@xmath4 .",
    "likewise , fig.5 can be used to predict masers in the 84  ghz transition of @xmath59mjybeam@xmath34 .",
    "confirming this observationally would be a good test of the model calculations .",
    "w28 and g1.4 - 0.1 are similar in linear sizes ( 27.9 and 24.7 pc respectively ) , but w28 is closer ( 2 kpc compared to 8.5 kpc for g1.4 - 0.1 ) and therefore w28 has a substantially larger angular size ( @xmath60 versus @xmath61 ) .",
    "consequently , a smaller angular area of w28 ( 2@xmath62 ) was searched for 36 and 44  ghz methanol masers @xcite .",
    "two 36  ghz and four 44  ghz masers were found , in contrast to the wealth of 36  ghz methanol emission seen in g1.4@xmath90.1 .",
    "the 44  ghz and 36  ghz masers are not co - spatial but instead observed in two distinct groups .",
    "each group is offset from , but nearby , known oh masers , consistent with the methanol masers being associated with a shocked environment .",
    "the clumping of the two transitions implies one lower- and one higher - density region .",
    "first , the 44  ghz maser region corresponds to a position of bright nh@xmath4 ( 3,3 ) inversion line emission @xcite with a critical density close to 10@xmath63 @xmath6 .",
    "this limits the density regime to @xmath64 @xmath6 , since at higher densities 36  ghz masers would be expected with similar brightness as the 44  ghz masers . for the clump of 36  ghz emission , the density may be higher ( @xmath65 @xmath6 ) , suppressing the 44  ghz transition .",
    "both of these regions are associated via shocks as shown by the presence of oh masers as well as sio emission @xcite , and the grouping of methanol masers implies the presence of clumps and/or density gradients .",
    "the galactic center ( gc ) is a complex region where at least two snrs are present ( sgraeast and g359.02@xmath90.09 ) .",
    "the sgraeast snr is interacting with the two main molecular clouds , m@xmath90.02@xmath90.07 ( a.k.a.the 50 kms@xmath34 cloud ) and m@xmath90.13@xmath90.08 ( a.k.a.the 20 kms@xmath34 cloud ) , providing collisionally compressed regions .",
    "in this rich environment , four different collisionally excited maser types have been found : 22  ghz h@xmath20o , 1720 mhz oh , 36  ghz ch@xmath4oh , and 44  ghz ch@xmath4oh @xcite .",
    "figure 6 outlines the distribution of methanol and oh masers in the gc as published originally by @xcite , using five selected pointing positions .",
    "three regions of methanol masers may be identified , to be discussed in turn : the southern part with a couple of 36  ghz masers ( a ) , a line of co - spatial 36  ghz and 44  ghz masers in the north - east ( b ) , and finally a region in the north - east corner dominated by 44  ghz emission ( c ) .",
    "region a ) in the south , which as in the case of g1.4@xmath90.1 ( sect.[g1.4 ] ) , can be interpreted as a high density , high temperature region with @xmath66 @xmath6 and @xmath67 k ( figs.4 and 5 ) .    region b ) is identified in @xcite as a sharp line following the edge of the radio continuum contour found delineating the snr shock front . here ,",
    "the 36  ghz masers are always much brighter than the 44  ghz masers , with flux density ratios between 10 - 75 . based on our modeling",
    ", this implies that the densities of the region are relatively high , close to @xmath40 @xmath6 , and thus closely corresponding to values found in region a ) as well as in g1.4@xmath90.1 ( sect.[g1.4 ] ) .",
    "region c ) differs somewhat from the previous cases but resembles the group of 44  ghz masers found in w28 ( sect.[w28 ] ) .",
    "one possibility is that these masers originate closer to the inner regions of the molecular cloud , not yet disturbed by the shock with densities @xmath68 @xmath6 . in this case",
    ", they may be associated with star formation .",
    "however , an alternative scenario is offered by the recent discovery of a dense molecular shell in this region , outlined by observations in the cs ( j=1 - 0 ) line @xcite . this shell",
    "is also identified via a high sio / h@xmath69co@xmath70 ratio @xcite , indicating a shocked shell .",
    "@xcite suggest that this is a young ( @xmath71 years ) snr expanding at a velocity of about 25kms@xmath34 .",
    "such a shock velocity is consistent with a c - shock , allowing the formation of methanol molecules . to detect cs",
    ", the density has to exceed the critical density of around @xmath72 @xmath6 .",
    "the positions of the 44  ghz methanol masers follow the dense ridge of this molecular shell @xcite , suggesting that these masers may be excited collisionally by a different snr shock front than those in a ) and b ) .",
    "this scenario is currently being investigated in more detail by mapping a more complete region of the gc in both 36 and 44  ghz methanol transitions .    both methanol transitions in the high - density regions",
    "a ) and b ) are offset spatially ( and in velocity ) from the 1720  mhz oh , which can be understood by the oh maser being most effective at more intermediate densities of @xmath73@xmath6 .",
    "however , the optical depth calculations presented in figs.4 and 5 allow equally bright 36  ghz and 44  ghz methanol at these intermediate densities , which is not observed",
    ". the lack of 36  ghz and 44  ghz masers agrees with the notion that oh molecules are being formed downstream the shock wave , and consequently oh masers are found in the post - shock region where methanol molecules may have been destroyed .",
    "the passage of a shock can efficiently enable o atoms for the production of h@xmath20o molecules .",
    "the formation of oh is a secondary step caused by photo - dissociation of h@xmath20o by internally produced uv photons .",
    "similarly , the high - density regions a ) and b ) do not harbor any 1612 mhz oh masers @xcite .",
    "this is expected since when the density in the oh region increases towards values of 10@xmath74 @xmath6 , the 1720 mhz oh masers becomes quenched , and the 1612 mhz transition instead becomes strongly inverted @xcite .",
    "the lack of 1612 mhz masers in these regions instead implies a chemistry where the oh abundance is low .",
    "this may be explained by gas that is too dense for uv photons to penetrate sufficiently deeply to create large amounts of oh from the photo - dissociation of h@xmath20o but keeping the methanol abundance intact .",
    "the above reasoning suggests that the relative distribution of maser species is also a question of relative molecular abundance , rather than simply density differences , emphasizing the need of observing several different molecular transitions to probe the conditions across these regions .",

    "three different regions of methanol masers are defined : a ) a couple of 36  ghz masers in the south , b ) the linear group of co - spatial 36  ghz and 44  ghz masers in the north - east , and c ) a group of 44  ghz dominated masers in the north - east corner . ]      to date , 84  ghz ch@xmath4oh maser emission has not been detected toward any snr , and there appears to be no published systematic searches for this transition towards snrs .",
    "@xcite report a 95  ghz maser detection toward the snr kes 79 , speculating that the maser emission is produced from the interaction of the snr and a neighboring molecular cloud .",

    "kes  79 has been detected in the 1720 mhz oh line , although not confirmed as maser emission @xcite .",
    "the 95  ghz detection is a good example of methanol being a complimentary shock tracer to the oh maser line .",
