    "cyg x-3 is the brightest radio source among x - ray binaries ( mccollough et al.1999 ) .",
    "it is a high - mass system with a wolf - rayet companion ( van kerkwijk et al .",
    "1996 ) , but with an unusually short orbital period , @xmath0 h. it is located at a distance of @xmath1 kpc in the galactic plane ( dickey 1983 ; predehl et al .",
    "2000 ) . in spite of its discovery in 1966 ( giacconi et al .  1967 ) , the system remains poorly understood . in particular , due to the lack of a reliable mass function , it remains uncertain whether its compact object is a black hole or a neutron star .",
    "currently , there are two other known x - ray binaries containing wolf - rayet stars , ic 10 x-1 ( prestwich et al .  2007 ) and ngc 300 x-1 ( carpano et al .",
    "2007a , b ) . in the former case",
    ", there is a very strong dynamical evidence that the compact object is a black hole of a high mass , @xmath2 if the companion has the mass indicated by its spectrum , and @xmath3 for the minimum possible companion mass ( silverman & filippenko 2008 ) .",
    "based on the luminosities observed from cyg x-3 in its different spectral states , hjalmarsdotter et al .",
    "( 2008a , hereafter hj08a ) and szostek & zdziarski ( 2008 , hereafter sz08 ) similarly found the most likely mass of the compact object to be @xmath3 . in the case of ngc 300 x-1 ,",
    "carpano et al .  (",
    "2007a ) argued for the presence of a black hole based on its very high luminosity and the similarity of the system to ic 10 x-1 .",
    "thus , it is very interesting that the three currently known wolf - rayet x - ray binaries may all contain black holes .    as an x - ray source ,",
    "cyg x-3 is persistent and observed in two main spectral states , hard and soft .",
    "recently , the hard state has been studied in detail by hj08a , and both the hard and soft states , by sz08 .",
    "however , there have yet been no comprehensive studies of the range of the states including the transitionary ones .",
    "interestingly , the spectra of cyg x-3 in spite of being generally similar to the canonical states of black hole binaries show some significant differences ( zdziarski & gierliski 2004 , hereafter zg04 ) .",
    "their physical interpretation also remains rather uncertain ( hj08a ; sz08 ) .",
    "a major issue is the strong and complex intrinsic absorption , most likely caused by the wind from the companion star , which greatly complicates the determination of the intrinsic spectral shapes and luminosities .",
    "sz08 have studied in detail the absorption in the wolf - rayet stellar wind , including effects of its velocity profile , the elemental composition , irradiation by the x - ray source , and inhomogeneities .",
    "they were able to determine the wind mass - loss rate as @xmath4 .",
    "however , even that detailed treatment of the wind absorption did not allow for an unambiguous determination of details of the underlying radiative processes in the two main spectral states .",
    "thus , it is highly desirable to further study the x - ray states of this system .    in the radio , cyg",
    "x-3 is a persistent source in the sense that is always detected , though its flux varies by four orders of magnitude , as well as the relative contributions of the core and jets vary strongly ( e.g. , tudose et al .",
    "2007 ) . on the basis of 19881992 radio observations by the green bank interferometer ( gbi ) , waltman et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1995 , 1996 ) identified four of its radio states .",
    "they include the so - called quiescent radio emission , with a @xmath550200 mjy flux variable on a timescale of months , episodes of frequent minor - flaring , @xmath6 jy , very weak , or quenched , emission , @xmath7 mjy , and major flares , @xmath5120 jy , which follow the quenched state .",
    "( note that the term quiescent used here is not related to the so - called quiescent state of low - mass x - ray binaries , which corresponds to much weaker states than the above one of cyg x-3 . )",
    "interestingly , all major radio flares were preceded by very low radio flux levels .",
    "however , apart from that sequence , those authors did not study either the temporal patterns of the radio states or their connection to the x - ray states .",
    "the existence of a relationship between the two energy bands was first pointed out by watanabe et al .",
    "( 1994 ) based on simultaneous monitoring by the gbi and the all sky monitor ( asm ) on board of _",
    "ginga_. they showed that strong radio flares occur only when the source was in its soft state .",
    "then , mccollough et al .",
    "( 1999 ) studied the relationship between the radio emission measured by the gbi and the hard x - ray , 20100 kev , emission measured by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on board of _ compton gamma ray observatory_. they found an anticorrelation in the quiescent state ( corresponding to the hard state in x - rays ) , a positive correlation during major radio flares and in the quenched state , and no correlation during minor flares .",
    "gallo , fender & pooley ( 2003 , hereafter gfp03 ) and hj08a have presented the correlation between the 1.512 kev x - ray flux measured by the asm on board of _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ _ r__xte ) and the 15 ghz measurements by the ryle telescope .",
    "they found a clear positive correlation in the hard x - ray state , and its break down above certain x - ray flux .",
    "the sign of the hard - state correlation of the 1.512 kev flux is opposite to that of the 20100 kev flux , which is consistent with the anticorrelation between those two x - ray bands ( e.g. , choudhury et al .",
    "2002 ; hj08a ) .",
    "however , details of the radio / x - ray behaviour in the soft state were not clear from these works .    in this paper",
    ", we present our new classifications of the x - ray and radio states of cyg x-3 , and study the long - term radio / x - ray correlation including the transitionary and soft states . in section [ xray ]",
    ", we present a detailed classification of the x - ray spectral states based on the x - ray data from the _ _",
    "r__xte proportional counter array ( pca ) and the high energy x - ray transient experiment ( hexte ) ( a preliminary account of some of these results was given in szostek & zdziarski 2004 ) . in section [ radio ] , we re - classify the radio states based the long - term temporal behaviour of the gbi ( radio ) and _ _ r__xte asm ( soft x - ray ) light curves , and relate these states to the x - ray spectral states .",
    "also , we analyze correlations of hard x - rays with the other bands using data from the batse . in section [ discussion ] , we summarize and discuss our results , as well as compare them to the corresponding results for black - hole and neutron - star x - ray binaries .",
    "in our analysis , we use the 35 kev soft x - ray band of the _ _ r__xte asm dwell data .",
    "as we have found out , the use of this band yields the cleanest radio / x - ray correlation . on the other hand , the asm 512 kev band overlaps with the region where the cyg x-3 spectra pivot , which results in the count rate of spectra with different shape being similar , which then smears the correlation .",
    "then , the 1.53 kev band is very strongly absorbed with the absorbing column being variable , which also results in a smearing of the correlation . also , the 35 kev band has the narrowest relative width among the three , and thus its count rate is closest to a monochromatic flux .",
    "we then use the 20100 kev hard x - ray data from the batse .",
    "the data have been obtained using an earth occultation analysis technique ( harmon et al .",
    "2002 ) ; see mccollough et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for analysis of an earlier part of the batse data .",
    "each point represents a 3-day average of the energy flux .",
    "the radio data have been collected during the monitoring program of the gbi ( see waltman et al .",
    "1994 , 1995 , 1996 ) . here",
    ", we use the data for mjd 5040951823 , during which period observations of cyg x-3 were performed several times per day on most days . for our analysis",
    "we use the 8.3 ghz data .",
    "this choice is arbitrary , the use of either the gbi 2.25 ghz data or the 15 ghz ryle telescope data yields relatively similar results .",
    "we then rebin the asm and gbi light curves in such way that the significance of a single bin is @xmath8 .",
    "the rebinned data are also plotted in the radio / soft x - ray correlation diagrams shown in section [ radio ] below requiring each pair of points to be taken on the same day . given the relatively low statistical quality of the batse data , we rebin its light curve to @xmath9 significance ( but requiring the distance between the midpoints of the data in a given bin to be @xmath10 days ) .",
    "in showing correlations of the hard x - ray data with the radio and soft x - rays , we slightly modify this criterion in order to achieve the best clarity of the graphical representations .",
    "also , since the measured fluxes from the batse are often null , we use a linear scale for it ( while we use logarithmic scales for all other data ) .",
    "we also use selected _ _",
    "r__xte pca and hexte pointed observations .",
    "we have selected 42 pointed observations from 19962000 for which the pca data from the proportional counter units",
    "02 were available .",
    "we have extracted the pca spectra in the 325 kev range using the top layer of the detectors .",
    "we then obtained the corresponding hexte spectra , using both hexte clusters , in the 15110 kev energy band . in our spectral fits , we allow a free relative normalization of the hexte spectra with respect to that from the pca .",
    "and [ asmradio_pointed ] below ) .",
    "the extreme states contain spectra with a strong soft x - ray emission followed by a weak hard x - ray tail ( group 5 ) , and those with a weak soft x - ray emission and hard x - rays peaking around @xmath520 kev ( group 1 ) . ]    , fitted with the same model as the individual spectra .",
    "the hexte data are renormalized to the level of the pca . ]",
    "we fit each of the 42 pca / hexte spectra with the same model as applied to _",
    "spectra from cyg x-3 by vilhu et al .",
    "similar models were also used by hj08a and sz08 .",
    "the model includes comptonization by hybrid ( i.e. , both thermal and nonthermal ) electrons ( coppi 1999 , gierliski et al .",
    "1999 ) , compton reflection from an ionized medium ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) , absorption by fully and partially covering neutral media , and a gaussian fe k fluorescent line .",
    "as discussed in vilhu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , this model treats the low - energy part of the spectrum only phenomenologically .",
    "still , it provides good fits to the pca / hexte spectra and a physical description of the hard x - rays .",
    "furthermore , a sophisticated stellar wind absorption model was used by sz08 in fits to x - ray spectra from two _ bepposax _ observations , in the hard and soft state .",
    "surprisingly , it was found that the model yields overall intrinsic spectral continua roughly similar to those obtained when the same data were fitted by the above phenomenological model , compare figs .  6 and 11 in sz08 .",
    "therefore , though the fitted absorber parameters of the phenomenological model can not be considered as a realistic description of the absorber , the resulting spectral shapes may , in principle , yield a fair approximation to the actual intrinsic x - ray spectra .",
    "however , details of those fits are beyond the scope of this work and are presented elsewhere ( hjalmarsdotter et al .",
    "2008b ) .",
    "the obtained ( absorbed ) model spectra are shown in fig .  [ individual ] .",
    "we have divided them into five groups based on their spectral shape and ordered by the decreasing flux at 20 kev .",
    "the increasing group number also roughly corresponds to the decreasing spectral hardness in the 1020 kev range .",
    "the groups 12 , 34 , and 5 may be classified as belonging to the hard , intermediate / soft and ultrasoft state , respectively .",
    "some of the flux variability within each group is caused by the orbital modulation .",

    "the source moves up and down along this branch , and the radio emission is correlated with soft x - rays .    the minor - flaring state ( x - ray type 2 ) corresponds to a transition between the radio quiescent state and the suppressed state , as well as between the hard and soft x - ray states .",
    "these transitions may occur in both directions , without any apparent hysteresis effects ( unlike black - hole transients , but similarly to cyg x-1 , zg04 ) .",
    "the radio / x - ray correlation changes its sign in this state from positive to negative .",
    "consequently , a further increase of the x - ray flux corresponds to a decrease of the radio flux , first to the suppressed state and then to the quenched one . as mentioned above , the suppressed state ( which we introduce in this work )",

    "the radio emission is anticorrelated with the 35 kev x - rays .",
    "interestingly , all major radio flares have been observed only after a radio quenched period , and in all cases except one ( the interval 25 in fig .",
    "[ asmradio ] , in which case after some initial increase of the radio flux the source returned to the quenched state , interval 26 ) , the quenched state is followed by a major flare .",
    "while on the major - flaring branch , the radio flux changes by more than three orders of magnitude while at the same time the 35 kev flux remains almost constant , and the x - ray spectra belong to the types 4 , 5 , see fig .",

    "the decline of the radio flux after a flare is through the minor - flaring and suppressed states , as shown in fig .",

    "[ asmradio2 ] .",
    "the correlation changes its sign from positive to negative , which can be fitted .",
    "however , in order to model the dominant long - term trend and reduce the scatter , we first generate the 15-point running median from those points ordered according to the increasing asm flux .",
    "as shown by the blue points in the inset in fig .",
    "[ asmradio2 ] , this indeed strongly reduces the scatter and yields a narrow path on the diagram .",

    "this behaviour is the same as that found by mccollough et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for an earlier data set ; however , we now show the position of the radio states on the flux - flux diagram .",

    "thus , on the major - flaring branch , the radio increases exponentially with an increase of the hard x - ray flux .",

    "the origin of this tail is probably due to comptonization by nonthermal electrons .",

    "is the interaction of the very strong stellar wind in cyg x-3 with a hot inner flow , but there is no quantitative model as yet .    on the other hand , there is also a certain similarity between the x - ray spectra of cyg x-3 and atoll sources ( which are weakly - magnetized neutron - star low - mass x - ray binaries ) , see , e.g. , the spectra of 4u 160852 in gierliski & done ( 2002 ) .",

    "five of them correspond to adjacent regions along a path on its flux - flux diagram .",
    "the evolution can go in either direction on that path except for the weakest radio state , the quenched one , which almost always leads to a major radio flare .",
    "the sixth radio state corresponds to the decline of major radio flares , which follows along paths avoiding the quenched state , thus forming a hysteresis loop .",
    "the radio / soft x - ray correlation is positive in the quiescent radio state , which corresponds to the hard spectral state ( the type 1 ) , and changes its sign to negative within the minor - flaring radio state , which corresponds to a softening of the x - ray spectra .",
    "the radio flux reaches its minimum when the soft x - ray flux is at its maximum .",
    "this point is followed by a major radio flare , when the radio flux can increase by @xmath40 at an approximately constant soft x - ray ( 35 kev ) flux .",

    "2007 ) . as mentioned above , grs 1915 + 105 is never in the hard state , and its radio / x - ray flux evolution resembles the quenched / major - flare branch of cyg x-3 , see klein - wolt et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , gfp03 .",
    "all of those similarities provide a very strong argument for the black - hole nature of the compact object in cyg x-3 .",
    "we note that the normalization of the radio flux in the hard state for a given soft x - ray flux is higher by an order of magnitude in cyg x-3 than in other black - hole binaries ( gfp03 ) .",
    "a part of this effect is clearly due to the strong x - ray absorption in cyg x-3 , e.g. , compare the absorbed and unabsorbed hard state x - ray spectra in sz08 .",
    "still , this may account only for about a factor of two in the _",
    "_ r__xte / asm range of 1.512 kev . to avoid the effect of x - ray absorption",
    ", we may consider a correlation of the radio flux with the unabsorbed bolometric x - ray fluxes .",
    "such correlation was calculated for gx 3394 by zdziarski et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who obtained @xmath41 for the our hard - state sample , the average radio flux is about 60 mjy , whereas the bolometric x - ray flux corrected for absorption is 10 kev @xmath18 s@xmath15 ( @xmath42 erg @xmath18 s@xmath15 ) , see hjalmarsdotter et al .",
    "( 2008b ) .",
    "the above relation implies then the radio flux of only 17 mjy , which means that cyg x-3 in the hard state for a given bolometric x - ray flux is @xmath534 times overluminous in radio compared to gx 3394 .",
    "some reduction of this factor may be due to cyg x-3 being possibly seen close to edge - on , which is likely to result in the x - ray emission being partly obscured in our direction ( see hj08a ) as well as moderately beamed toward the polar direction , but this is unlikely to account for this factor of three .",
    "the net overluminous radio emission may be due to a turbulent interaction of the very strong stellar wind with the hot inner accretion flow , resulting in copious acceleration of electrons to nonthermal energies .",
    "( as discussed above , the same effect may be responsible for the peculiar spectral shape of the x - ray spectrum in the hard state . )    on the other hand , weakly - magnetized neutron - star x - ray binaries produce much less , by an order of magnitude , radio power at a given soft x - ray flux than the black - hole binaries ( migliari & fender 2006 ) . also , the slope of hard - state correlation is similar in cyg x-3 and in other black hole binaries ( gfp03 ) whereas it is much steeper , with the power - law index @xmath391.4 , in neutron - star binaries ( migliari & fender 2006 ) .",
    "thus , the presence of a neutron star in cyg x-3 appears highly unlikely .",
    "we have also studied correlations involving hard x - rays .",
    "overall , the hard x - rays , 20100 kev in our study , are anticorrelated with the 35 kev x - rays , see fig .",
    "[ batse](b ) , which corresponds to spectral pivoting with a pivot energy between the two bands ( see figs .",
    "[ individual][groups ] , also choudhury et al .",
    "this behaviour is again similar to that of black - hole binaries , in particular in cyg x-1 , where a strong correlation between the 1.53 kev asm and 100300 kev batse fluxes is seen , see fig .",
    "9b of zdziarski et al .",
    "note that the blackbody temperature in cyg x-3 is higher ( hj08a ; sz08 ) than that in cyg x-1 , so the 35 kev band is a better indicator of the disc flux in the former .",
    "the hard - state spectrum of cyg x-3 has a significantly lower cutoff energy than that typical for black - hole binaries , so the 20100 kev band samples the spectral region of the cutoff in cyg x-3 , whereas the 100300 kev band does it in cyg x-1 .",
    "after those adjustments , the hard / soft x - ray anticorrelations in the hard state in cyg x-1 and cyg x-3 appear very similar .",
    "the likely physical explanation of it in cyg x-1 is a variable flux in seed photons irradiating the hot comptonizing plasma supplied with an approximately constant power , which results in the plasma temperature decreasing with the increasing seed photon flux ( see fig .  14 in zdziarski et al .  2002 ) .",
    "a similar explanation is likely to hold in cyg x-3 .",
    "also , in both objects , the batse flux drops to very low values in the soft states with the highest asm flux .",
    "both objects also show a flat dependence in intermediate soft states .",
    "given the hard - state anticorrelation between the soft and hard x - rays , the positive correlation of the radio flux with the soft x - rays becomes a negative one with the hard x - rays , see fig .",
    "[ batse](a ) .",
    "the fact that the correlation of the radio emission is positive with the soft x - rays points out to the importance of the blackbody - emitting disc ( or its inner edge ) to the jet formation in the hard state .    on the other hand , while the soft x - ray flux is almost constant during major flares , the hard x - ray flux is strongly ( and positively ) correlated with the radio flux during major flares .",
    "the x - ray spectra during the major flares are soft / high , very high , or ultrasoft ( fig .",
    "[ majorflare ] ) .",
    "the dominant spectral components during major flares in the 35 kev and 20100 kev bands are the weakly varying ( disc ) blackbody and a strongly varying high - energy tail , respectively , see fig .",
    "[ majorflare ] .",
    "this behaviour is likely explained by the presence of a stable accretion disc and variable active regions above the disc , and it is again typical to black - hole binaries , see the analogous result for the soft state of cyg x-1 in zdziarski et al .",
    "in the case of cyg x-3 , we have discovered that the radio flux during major flares responds exponentially to the amplitude of the high - energy tail , see fig .",
    "[ batse](a ) and equation ( [ fit2 ] ) .",
    "this shows that the radio - emitting region communicates , on time scales of the order of a day , with the x - ray source , and it is not detached from it .",
    "an important issue is the origin of the high - energy , hard x - ray , tail in the soft states .",
    "gierliski et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , zdziarski et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2002 , 2005 ) and gierliski & done ( 2003 ) modelled this tail in the black - hole binaries cyg x-1 , grs 1915 + 105 , and xte j1550564 by comptonization in a hybrid plasma , in which the electron distribution contains a significant non - thermal high - energy tail .",
    "this comptonization presumably takes place in some coronal regions above the accretion disc .",
    "the correlation of the tail amplitude with the radio flux may be then due to the formation of radio - flare emitting blobs being related to the non - thermal coronal regions .",
    "still , the observed radio flux has to be due to synchrotron emission in jet regions relatively far away from the compact object , which is required by the lack of any orbital modulation in cyg x-3 by free - free absorption in the stellar wind ( szostek & zdziarski 2007 ) .    on the other hand , a rather common model in the astrophysical literature attributes hard x - ray tails of black - hole binaries in soft states directly to emission of non - thermal electrons in the jet , usually via the synchrotron process .",
    "there are two major problems with this model ( see zdziarski et al .",
    "one is that the spectra of the tails are generally soft , with the photon indices of @xmath43 , typically @xmath53 , which is also the case in most of the soft states of cyg x-3 ( fig .",
    "[ groups ] ) .",
    "such a soft spectrum extrapolated to the turnover frequency , typically in the infrared , would yield a huge luminosity , orders of magnitude higher than those observed .",
    "second , the high - energy tails are always smoothly connected to the disc component , which is naturally explained by the tails being due to comptonization of the disc photons .",
    "if they were due to a process unrelated to the disc , their amplitude in the hard x - ray region could be any , without any reason for this smooth connection .",
    "the first problem can be circumvented by requiring that the synchrotron spectrum is hard at low energies and it breaks to a soft one just below the region where the tails are observed .",
    "this , however , requires yet another fine - tuning , and given the large observed sample of high - energy tails , can be ruled out on statistical grounds .",
    "it is of great interest whether the non - thermal electrons responsible for either the hard x - ray tails or the radio emission during major flares may be accelerated to high enough energies to result in detectable emission in the @xmath44-ray range , e.g. , the gev or tev band . up to now , no tev emission from cyg x-3 has been confirmed ( compare , e.g. , lamb et al .",
    "1982 with weekes 1983 ) .",
    "however , given our result on major radio flares being indicators of the presence of hard x - ray tails , gev and tev emission should be searched for during those radio flares .    finally , we point out that the radio source in cyg x-3 consists of the core and the jet components , which can be resolved ( e.g. , mart , paredes & peracaula 2000 ; mioduszewski et al .  2001 ) .",
    "in fact , the e - vlbi results of tudose et al .",
    "( 2007 ) show that the core may become undetectable during a radio flare . on the other hand",
    ", our analysis in the radio band has been done using data from the gbi , which beam includes both the core and jet components , which did not allow us to include the spatial dimension in the correlation analysis . also , our analysis did not take into account time lags of the radio emission with respect to the x - rays .",
    "these issues , as well as development of theoretical models , should be dealt with in future studies of radio / x - ray correlations .",
