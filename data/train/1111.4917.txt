    "[ thepackings ] .    in the past , finding the densest packings has been difficult in part due to the complexity of proving that a packing of spheres in @xmath10 is the densest possible , evident in that kepler s conjecture concerning the densest packings of monodisperse spheres in @xmath12 was only recently proved by hales @xcite . in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane , the monodisperse case corresponds to the kepler limit @xmath26 ; in this limit , the packing fraction of the densest packings is @xmath27 .",

    "each distinct alloy appears in the densest packings over a range of @xmath0 .",
    "however , most alloys exhibit varying contact networks over this range , where a contact network describes the numbers of small and large sphere contacts for each sphere in the minimal basis .",
    "each distinct alloy could thus be subdivided into `` suballoys '' based on contact networks , as was done for the periodic disk alloys in ref .",
    "though we do not make these subdivisions in this work due to the very large number of suballoys that would be identified , we note that there are practical reasons for the subdivision .",

    "periodic packing_. a periodic packing is obtained by placing a fixed configuration of the centers of @xmath76 objects , called the _ basis _ , in one cell of a lattice @xmath77 , and then replicating this fixed configuration , without overlap , in all other cells .",

    "it is critical to note that no binary packing with @xmath82 can be a lattice packing , since the basis of a binary packing by definition must consist of at least two objects .",
    "an aperiodic packing is one that exhibits no long - range translational order ; _ i.e. _ , its minimal basis is equal to the number of particles in the packing . practically speaking though",
    ", a packing with a very large number of objects might be called aperiodic if it is comprised of only a few translations of the minimal basis .",
    "both periodic and aperiodic structures are found widely in nature ; examples of the former include crystalline solids like many metals and salts , and examples of the latter include liquids , glasses , gels , gases , plasmas and quasicrystals @xcite .",

    "we describe a _ directionally periodic _ structure as an aperiodic structure that exhibits a period along at least one spatial axis but never simultaneously along @xmath8 lattice vectors , _",
    "e.g. _ , a random stacking barlow packing .",
    "the barlow packings are constructed by stacking layers , each consisting of contacting spheres in @xmath12 with centers on a plane in a triangular lattice configuration , on top of one another .",
    "there are two ways ( layers in positions @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) to stack such a layer on top of another ( layer in position @xmath85 ) such that all spheres in each layer are in contact with three spheres in the adjacent layer .",
    "any packing that is composed of an infinite number of @xmath85 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 layers , with no adjacent layers the same , is a barlow packing and achieves the maximal packing fraction of identical spheres in @xmath12 .",
    "a random stacking of layers according to these rules is a random stacking barlow packing , which exhibits periodicity parallel to the planes of the layers but not perpendicular to them .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we describe a _ disordered _ structure as an aperiodic structure that does not exhibit perfect long - range symmetry , translational , rotational , or reflective , of any kind .    in @xmath64 ,",
    "periodic , quasicrystalline , and directionally periodic structures can all be found among the putative densest binary disk packings @xcite .",
    "we believe that all of these types of structures may be found among the densest binary sphere packings in @xmath12 as well , though we have identified only periodic and directionally periodic structures in this work . due to computational constraints attributable in large part to the scope and resolution of our survey in @xmath39 ,",
    "we have limited our survey in this work to investigating the densest periodic packings with bases of @xmath33 spheres or fewer .",
    "this limitation substantially increases the difficulty of identifying aperiodic packings , which most often can not be approximated well by a fundamental cell with a basis of only @xmath33 spheres , though densest directionally periodic packings often can still be identified by extrapolating from periodic packings .",
    "one property of a densest packing is that a subset of its objects is _ collectively jammed _ , or in the case of a densest periodic packing , that the objects within each unit cell are _ strictly jammed _ under periodic boundary conditions .",
    "none of the nonoverlapping objects in a packing that is _ locally jammed _ can be continuously displaced ( displaced by infinitesimally small movements ) without displacing one of its neighbors @xcite . in a collectively jammed packing",
    ", a subset of the objects ( the _ backbone _ ) is locally jammed and no continuous collective motion of any subset of objects can lead to _ unjamming _ , _ i.e. _ , a packing that is no longer locally jammed .",
    "the objects that can be displaced without displacing their neighbors in a collectively jammed packing are termed _",
    "rattlers_. a strictly jammed packing is collectively jammed , and no collective motion of any subset of objects , coupled with a continuous deformation of the boundary that does not increase volume , can result in unjamming . if a subset of the objects in a packing is not collectively or strictly jammed , then by definition a uniform continuous motion exists that results in free space around the objects , i.e. , the packing is not a densest packing because its volume can be reduced .",
    "one reason that the tj algorithm is particularly effective at finding densest periodic packings is that it guarantees that final packings are strictly jammed @xcite .",
    "if there is a collective continuous motion of the spheres , coupled with a uniform continuous deformation of the unit cell , that will decrease the volume of the cell , then the exact linear programming method employed by the tj algorithm will find that motion .    with respect to jamming , a certain group of packings that we call `` host - guest '' packings deserves further attention .",
    "in such a packing , a subset ( usually the larger spheres ) of the total packing are packed as a jammed periodic packing , and a mutually exclusive subset ( usually the smaller spheres ) sit in the interstices formed by the jammed spheres but without contacting the jammed spheres .",
    "clearly , the spheres within the interstices can be continually displaced without altering the density of the packing . in this way",
    ", a host - guest packing can be periodic or aperiodic .",
    "if the rattlers are placed in the same place relative to one another throughout every cell of the packing , then the packing is periodic .",
    "if they are placed at random , then the packing is aperiodic .",
    "a host - guest packing is similar in nature to an interstitial solid solution ( iss ) phase , such as the stable binary colloidal phases described in ref .",
    "we are not aware of any densest packings where the large spheres are free to move , as rattlers , within interstices created by jammed small spheres .",
    "the xy@xmath4 packings where small spheres are not required to contact the jammed large spheres are good examples of host - guest sphere packings , where an xy@xmath4 packing consists of a barlow - packed structure of contacting large spheres with small spheres placed in the interstices . among the host - guest packings , one can distinguish topologically between packings where the small spheres are small enough to move freely about all of the interstices and packings where they are confined to a given interstice or finite set of interstices . in the former case ,",
    "the space available to the small spheres is topologically connected , where in the latter case it is not .",
    "though we find densest packings ( _ e.g. _ , xy@xmath4 packings ) where small spheres are confined to a single interstice , we do not find for @xmath86 any where they are free to move about all of the interstices .",
    "however , it is the case for small enough @xmath0 that there are densest host - guest packings where the space available to the small spheres is topologically connected .",
    "there are several factors that have limited past algorithmic techniques in finding densest packings .",
    "as previously discussed , one of these is the immensity of the parameter space in @xmath39 of densest binary packings .",
    "another is the strong initial condition dependence of many algorithms , which requires that a very large number of simulations beginning with different initial spatial conditions be undertaken to find a densest packing .",
    "this required number of simulations can increase exponentially with the number of spheres simulated .",
    "past algorithmic techniques have also been limited by the vast multitude of local minima in `` energy '' , defined as the negative of the packing fraction , present in the phase space of a periodic sphere packing with unit cell of indeterminate size and shape with even a small basis .",
    "methods that move only one sphere at a time can not escape from local minima where a collective motion of spheres is required to decrease energy , and methods that move several spheres at once rely on chance , and hence a very large number of steps , to find the right collective movement .",
    "many molecular dynamics algorithms rely upon principles of equilibrium thermodynamics , which necessitate that large numbers of time - consuming steps ( individual sphere movements ) be taken at each stage of sphere growth or compression of the unit cell in order to reduce the chance of becoming `` stuck '' in a local minimum .    in this paper",
    ", we are able to overcome these time and computational limitations by using the torquato - jiao linear programming algorithm @xcite . the tj sphere packing algorithm does not easily become `` stuck '' in local minima because it is inherently designed to find the simultaneous collective linear motion of both the spheres and the unit cell geometry that maximizes the density of the packing .",
    "the tj algorithm approaches the problem of generating dense , periodic packings of nonoverlapping spheres with an arbitrary size distribution as an optimization problem to be solved using linear programming techniques .",
    "in particular , the objective function is chosen to be the negative of the packing fraction ( as indicated above ) , which is minimized with respect to particle ( sphere center ) positions and the shape and size of the unit cell , subject to sphere nonoverlap conditions .",
    "the use of a deformable unit cell , defined in terms of @xmath8 , @xmath8-dimensional lattice vectors @xmath87 , was first introduced by torquato and jiao @xcite to obtain dense packings of hard polyhedral particles including platonic and archimedean solids .    for nonoverlapping spheres ,",
    "the optimization problem can be efficiently solved by linearizing the objective function and nonoverlap constraints .",
    "this approach has the advantage of being rigorously exact near the jamming limit of the spheres and unit cell @xcite .",
    "the tj algorithm begins with an initial packing of @xmath78 spheres , and obtains a new , denser packing by solving the following linear programming problem : @xmath88    where @xmath89 is the average diameter of spheres @xmath90 and @xmath91 ; @xmath92 is the displacement vector between spheres @xmath90 and @xmath91 in the initial packing with respect to the lattice vectors @xmath93 ; @xmath94 is the relative change in displacement of spheres @xmath90 and @xmath91 in coordinates with respect to the @xmath93 ; @xmath95 is the strain tensor associated with the unit cell , with lower and upper bounds @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively ; @xmath98 is the _ gram matrix _ of the lattice and @xmath99 is a scalar representing higher order terms , which are given in appendix [ algmods ] .",
    "the _ neighbor _ pairs are determined by an _ influence sphere _ with radius @xmath100 , i.e. , two spheres @xmath90 and @xmath91 are considered neighbors if their pair distance is smaller than @xmath100 . we note that the choice of the influence sphere radius can significantly affect the density and degree of disorder in the final packing . for densest packings ,",
    "a large @xmath100 should be used , as detailed in ref .",
    "we also note that to study packings of spheres with non - additive diameters , one simply sets @xmath101 to the desired value when spheres @xmath90 and @xmath91 are not of the same type .",
    "our tests of the tj algorithm , for which the implementation for binary sphere packings is described in appendix [ algmods ] , indicate that the algorithm is both particularly efficient and particularly robust in finding densest packings across the entire range of @xmath39 for a sufficiently small basis of spheres .",
    "for example , we have recovered all of the alloys known to be present in the densest packings , including the a@xmath24b @xcite , alb@xmath2 , hgbr@xmath2 , aute@xmath2 , and `` structure 2 '' @xcite alloys , and xy@xmath4 packings for certain values of @xmath5 .",
