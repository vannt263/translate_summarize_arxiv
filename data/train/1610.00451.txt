    "the formation of globular clusters ( gcs ) and the origin of their ubiquitous multiple stellar populations remain a major astrophysical challenge . in this series of papers ,",
    "we build on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) uv legacy survey of galactic globular clusters ( piotto et al . 2015 , hereafter paper i of this series ) to fully document the complexity of the multiple populations .",
    "this phenomenon is most effectively characterized when combining ultraviolet and optical _ hst _ photometry , as documented by pilot studies by our group ( e.g. , milone et al.2012b , 2013 ; piotto et al.2013 ) .",
    "these studies have demonstrated that appropriate combinations of ultraviolet and optical filters , to construct e.g. , @xmath1 vs.@xmath2 two - color diagrams or the @xmath3 plot vs. the pseudo - color @xmath4 ) , very efficiently identify multiple stellar populations in gcs ( see paperi for a general introduction into the subject ) .    in other papers ( milone et al.2015a , b hereafter papers ii and iii )",
    ", we have shown that the combination of the @xmath5 pseudo - color with the @xmath6 color maximizes the separation between stellar populations along the main sequence ( ms ) and the red giant branch ( rgb ) and have used this diagram to identify and characterize seven distinct stellar populations in ngc7089 ( paper ii ) and at least five populations in ngc2808 ( paper iii ) . in paper",
    "iv of this series we provided accurate determination of the gc helium abundance and ages of stellar populations in ngc6352 ( nardiello et al.2015a ) , while in paper v we have exploited the first results from our survey to set constraints on the formation scenarios ( renzini et al.2015 )",
    ". other papers of this series include the study of the internal dynamics of multiple populations ( bellini et al.2015 , paper vi ) and of the horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology ( brown et al.2016 , paper vii ) .",
    "an early - stage data release of the photometric and astrometric data is provided in paper viii by soto et al.(2016 ) .    in this paper , we identify and characterize multiple stellar populations along the rgb for the entire sample of 57 gcs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "data reduction and analysis are briefly described in section  [ sec : data ] . in section  [ sec : map ]",
    "we measure the intrinsic rgb width in @xmath5 and @xmath6 for all the clusters and we describe how to combine these two quantities to construct ` chromosome maps ' , which most efficiently identify the distinct stellar populations hosted by each individual gc .",
    "the chromosome maps of all the clusters are presented in section  [ sec : rea ] .",
    "we distinguish between putative first and second generations of stars ( respectively 1 g and 2 g ) and measure the fraction of 1 g stars over the total cluster population . a group of gcs exhibiting particularly complex chromosome maps and characterized by the presence of a multimodal subgiant branch ( sgb ) are further investigated in section  [ sec : ano ] . in section  [ sec : relw ] we present univariate relations between the global parameters of the host clusters , the rgb width and the population ratio .",
    "summary and conclusions follow in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "this study is mostly based on data from the _ hst _ program go-13297 ( pi.g.piotto ) and data from the pilot programs go-12605 and go-11233 from the same pi .",
    "the aim of these programs is to derive high - precision photometry and astrometry of stars in 57 clusters through the f275w , f336w , and f438w filters of the of _ hst _ ultraviolet and visual channel of the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3/uvis ) .",
    "in addition to data and catalogs illustrated in paperi , we make use of f606w and f814w photometry from the wide field channel of the advanced camera for survey ( wfc / acs ) which is available for all clusters , mainly from the acs survey of galactic globular clusters ( go-10775 , pi.a.sarajedini , see sarajedini et al.2007 ) . in order to improve the quality of the photometry for a few clusters",
    ", we have included additional archival wfc3/uvis images in f275w , f336w , and f438w as reported in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "all the images have been corrected for the effect of poor charge transfer efficiency following anderson & bedin(2010 ) .",
    "photometry has been performed on each individual exposure by using the program img2xym_wfc3uv , which has been developed by jay anderson and is similar to the img2xym_wfc program ( anderson & king2006 ) , but optimized for uvis / wfc3 data . for saturated very - bright stars",
    "the photometry was performed using the method developed by gilliland ( 2004 ) , which recovers the electrons that have bled into neighbouring pixels .",
    "we refer to section  8.1 in anderson et al.(2008 ) for details on the application of this method .",
    "stellar positions have been corrected for geometric distortion using the solution by bellini , anderson & bedin(2011 ) .",
    "photometry has been calibrated to the vega - mag system as in bedin et al.(2005 ) , by using the photometric zero points provided by the wfc3/uvis web page .",
    "stellar proper motions have been obtained as in anderson & king ( 2003 ) and piotto et al.(2012 ) by comparing the average stellar positions derived from the wfc3 images in the f336w and f438w bands with those from the catalogs by anderson et al.(2008 ) .",
    "we have included in the following analysis only stars that are cluster members according to their proper motions .    since we are interested in high - precision photometry , we limited our study to relatively - isolated stars with small astrometric uncertainties that are well fitted by the psf and selected by following the prescriptions given in milone et al.(2012b ) .",
    "finally , the photometry has been corrected for differential reddening that area crucial step in identifying multiple sequences from photometry . to do this",
    "we have used the method by milone et al.(2012b ) . in a nutshell",
    ", we derived a @xmath7 clipped fiducial line of the ms and the sgb of each cluster by putting a spline through the median value of colors and magnitude in progressively narrower magnitude intervals .",
    "we have then determined for each star the color residuals of the closest 50 relatively - bright and well - measured ms and sgb stars with respect to the fiducial line . to do this",
    "we have excluded the target star from the calculation of its own differential reddening .",
    "we assumed as the differential reddening of each star the median value of such residuals measured along the reddening vector , while the uncertainty on the differential - reddening has been derived as in milone(2015 ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + [ tab : data ]",
    "in the next subsections we explain how we measured the intrinsic @xmath6 and @xmath5 rgb width , and used these two quantities to construct the chromosome map of each cluster .",
    "we then continue our analysis by using these maps to identify the 1 g and 2 g stellar populations along the rgb .",
    "the color broadening of the rgb provides evidence for the presence and diversity of multiple stellar populations in gcs . indeed , in a simple stellar population ( made of chemically homogeneous and coeval stars ) the observed rgb width is entirely due to observational errors , whereas the observed rgb width is much wider than expected from photometric errors if multiple stellar populations are present .",
    "the procedure to estimate the rgb width in the @xmath3 vs. @xmath6 and @xmath5 plots is illustrated in figure  [ fig : metodomappa ] for the cluster ngc6723 , taken as an example ; the procedure is based in part on the naive estimator ( silverman 1986 ) .",
    "we started by dividing the rgb into a series of f814w magnitude bins of size @xmath8 .",
    "the bins are defined over a grid of points separated by intervals of fixed magnitude ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the procedure is extended to the rgb region fainter than the hb level , where multiple sequences are more - clearly visible .    for each bin in f814w , we calculated the value of the 4@xmath10 and the 96@xmath10 percentile of the @xmath6 and @xmath5 distributions , to which we associated the mean f814w magnitude of rgb stars in each bin .",
    "the resulting envelope of the rgb is represented by the red and blue lines in figure  [ fig : metodomappa ] .",
    "the smoothing has been performed by boxcar averaging , where each point has been replaced by the average of the three adjacent points . due to the small number of upper rgb stars , above the hb level",
    ", the red and the blue envelopes in the region have been drawn by eye .",
    "the observed rgb width , @xmath11 , has been derived as the difference between the @xmath5 index of the red and blue fiducial line , calculated 2.0 f814w magnitudes above the ms turnoff , as illustrated in panel ( b1 ) of figure  [ fig : metodomappa ] .",
    "the error associated to @xmath11 has been determined by bootstrapping with replacements over the sample of rgb stars , then repeated 1,000 times .",
    "the derived errors refer to one standard deviation of the bootstrapped measurements .",
    "the observed rgb width is partly intrinsic and partly due to observational errors and limited statistics .",
    "the intrinsic rgb width , @xmath12 , is calculated by subtracting in quadrature the errors affecting the observed width , which include both photometric errors and errors in the differential - reddening correction .",
    "the same procedure was adopted to measure the intrinsic @xmath6 rgb color width , @xmath13 , as illustrated in panel ( a1 ) of figure  [ fig : metodomappa ] .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tab : w ] and reveal that for all the analyzed gcs , the rgb width is always significantly wider than expected from the errors alone , proving that all 57 gcs host multiple stellar populations .",
    "we now combine the pieces of information coming from both the @xmath3 vs.@xmath6 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) and the @xmath3 vs.@xmath5 diagram to identify the multiple stellar populations in each gc . to this end",
    ", we have used the method illustrated in figure  [ fig : metodomappa ] , analogous to the technique introduced in papersii and iii , and illustrated here for the rgb of ngc6723 .",
    "briefly , we have ` verticalized ' the two diagrams in such a way that the blue and the red fiducial lines translate into vertical lines .",
    "this is obtained by defining for each star : @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16=(@xmath6 ) and @xmath17= @xmath5 and ` fiducial r ' and ` fiducial b ' correspond to the red and the blue fiducial lines , respectively , as shown in panels ( a2 ) and ( b2 ) of figure  [ fig : metodomappa ] .",
    "thus , @xmath18 and @xmath19 correspond to stars lying on the corresponding red fiducial line and the @xmath20 quantities represent the color and pseudo - color distance from such lines .",
    "the resulting @xmath21 vs.@xmath22 plot is shown in panels ( c ) and ( d ) and reveals the distinct stellar populations of ngc6723 .    following the nomenclature introduced in paper v",
    ", we will refer to plots such as those shown in panels ( c ) and ( d ) of figure  [ fig : metodomappa ] as the ` chromosome map ' of a gc .",
    "the chromosome maps of all 57 gcs are presented in section  [ sec : rea ] .",
    "the chromosome map of ngc6723 shown in panels ( c ) and ( d ) of figure  [ fig : metodomappa ] and in the left panel of figure  [ fig : p1p2 ] reveals that cluster stars are distributed along two main , distinct groups that we name 1 g and 2 g and that correspond to the first and second generation of stars as defined in paper v. it is indeed commonly believed that the multiple stellar populations phenomenon in gcs is the result of multiple events of star formation where 2 g stars form out of material processed by 1 g stars ( e.g. , decressin et al.2007 , paper v , dantona et al.2016 and references therein ) .",
    "thus , in this paper we will consider gc ` multiple populations ' and ` multiple generations ' as synonyms , as done in previous papers of this series .    we preliminarily identify 1 g stars as those at nearly constant @xmath23 departing from the origin of the reference frame , located at @xmath24 . as a consequence ,",
    "2 g stars are identified as those in the steep branch reaching high values of @xmath21 .",
    "a full justification of this choice is presented in section  [ sec : chemistry ] , where 1 g and 2 g are chemically tagged , in analogy to what done in paper ii and paper iii .",
    "the procedure to define a sample of bona - fide 1 g and 2 g stars is illustrated in figure  [ fig : p1p2 ] for ngc6723 .",
    "the green line is a fit to the group of 1 g stars and the angle between the green line and the dashed horizontal line is @xmath25 .",
    "we adopted this same value of @xmath26 for all the analyzed clusters .",
    "the @xmath27 versus @xmath28 diagram shown in the middle panel of figure  [ fig : p1p2 ] has been obtained by rotating counterclockwise the left - panel diagram by an angle @xmath26 around the origin of the reference frame , and the black histogram plotted in the right panel represents the normalized @xmath27 distribution of cluster stars .",
    "the orange points shown in the left and middle panels of figure  [ fig : p1p2 ] represent the expected distribution of the observational errors obtained by montecarlo simulations and have been plotted at the arbitrary position @xmath29 .",
    "the normalized histogram distribution of the @xmath27 errors is shown in orange in the right panel of the figure .",
    "the magenta dashed line is then plotted at the @xmath27 level corresponding to the @xmath30 deviation from the mean of the error histogram , and the same line is also reported in the left panel , after counter - rotation .",
    "we have then taken as bona fide 1 g stars all those below the magenta dashed line , while the remaining stars are defined as 2 g .",
    "1 g and 2 g stars are colored aqua and magenta , respectively , in the left and middle panel of figure  [ fig : p1p2 ] .",
    "we can already notice that the @xmath22 and @xmath21 extension of both 1 g and 2 g stars in this cluster is significantly wider than expected from photometric errors alone , thus demonstrating that both 1 g and 2 g stars in the cluster are not chemically homogeneous .",
    "as we shall see , this is the case for the vast majority of our 57 gcs .",
    "figures  [ fig : maps1 ] to  [ fig : maps5 ] show a collection of the chromosome maps for all 57 gcs studied in this paper .",
    "gcs are roughly sorted in order of decreasing metallicity , from the most metal rich ( ngc6624 , [ fe / h]=@xmath310.44 , figure  [ fig : maps1 ] ) to the most metal poor ( ngc7078 , [ fe / h]=@xmath312.37 , figure  [ fig : maps5 ] ) .      in most maps it is possible to easily identify the two main groups of 1 g and 2 g stars as it was the case for ngc6723 ( see figure  [ fig : p1p2 ] ) .",
    "the magenta dashed lines superimposed on each panel of figures  [ fig : maps1]  [ fig : maps5 ] have been derived as described in section  [ sub : g1g2 ] and have been used to identify the two groups of bona fide 1 g and 2 g stars of each cluster .",
    "clusters for which the map allows the 1g/2 g distinction as described for ngc 6723 are called here type i clusters . however , the extension of the 1 g group of stars and its separation from the 2 g group are quite ambiguous in some clusters , and eventually a distinction between 1 g and 2 g groups is no longer possible , at least with the present photometric accuracy .",
    "this is the case for the three clusters ngc5927 , ngc6304 , and ngc6441 . the 1g/2 g separation may still be possible using other passbands , such as in the case of ngc6441 ( bellini et al.2013 )",
    ".    finally , several other clusters exhibit more complex chromosome maps , with an additional 2 g sequence ( e.g.ngc1851 ) or even what appears to be a split of both 1 g and 2 g sequences ( e.g.ngc6934 )",
    ". stars in these additional sequences are colored in red in the chromosome maps .",
    "these are the clusters that define the type ii and , besides the mentioned ngc1851 and ngc6934 , this group includes ngc362 , ngc1261 , ngc5286 , ngc6388 , ngc6656 , ngc6715 , ngc7089 and the famous @xmath32 cen which , not surprisingly , has the most complex map of them all .",
    "noticeably , in order to derive the red and blue fiducial lines that are used to determine the chromosome map of type - ii gcs ( see figure  [ fig : metodomappa ] ) , we used only blue - rgb stars .",
    "type ii clusters deserve a dedicated analysis , which is presented in section  [ sec : ano ] .",
    "as illustrated by figures  [ fig : maps1 ] to [ fig : maps5 ] , the chromosome maps of of type i gc exhibit a great deal of variety .",
    "in particular , the @xmath23 and @xmath22 extensions differ from one cluster to another , and in several clusters distinct clumps are clearly visible within the 1 g and/or the 2 g sequences .",
    "this is the case of ngc2808 where at least five distinct sub - populations can be identified , as already illustrated in paper iii .",
    "the detailed study of substructures within the 1 g and 2 g sequences is not further developed in the present paper .    among type i clusters ,",
    "quite surprising is the case of ngc6441 , often considered a twin cluster of ngc6388 , since both are metal rich clusters with an extended blue hb ( e.g. , rich et al.1997 ; bellini et al.2013 , and references therein ) . yet , their chromosome maps are radically different , with the type ii ngc6388 exhibiting a very complex map whereas the type i ngc6441 shows a unique sequence where it is not even possible to distinguish between 1 g and 2 g stars .",
    "similarly , we note significant difference between the chromosome map of the second - parameter pair cluster ngc6205 ( m13 ) and ngc5272 ( m3 ) , with the latter hosting a very extended 1 g .",
    "first- and second - generation stars in the other famous second - parameter pair , ngc288 ngc362 , share a similar distribution in the corresponding chromosome maps .",
    "intriguingly , ngc362 hosts a poorly - populated red - rgb , which is not present in ngc288 .      the procedure to estimate the fraction of 1g - stars with respect to the total number of studied rgb stars ( @xmath33 ) is illustrated in the upper panels of figure  [ fig : prschema ] for ngc6723 , where we reproduce the @xmath27 versus @xmath28 plot shown in figure  [ fig : p1p2 ] , now having colored 1 g and 2 g stars aqua and magenta , respectively .",
    "the corresponding histogram distribution of @xmath27 is plotted in the upper - right panel of figure  [ fig : prschema ] .",
    "the gaussian fit to the distribution of bona fide 1 g stars selected in section  [ sec : mappe ] is represented by the red continuous line .",
    "the fraction of 1 g stars ( @xmath34 ) has been derived as the ratio between the area under the gaussian and the total number of rgb stars in the chromosome map .",
    "the middle panels of figure  [ fig : prschema ] illustrate the procedure described above , now applied to ngc6205 where the separation between 1 g and 2 g stars is much less evident than for ngc6723 .",
    "ngc6205 is the most uncertain case for a cluster that we classified as type i. the lower panels of figure  [ fig : prschema ] show the case for ngc6441 , where there is no appreciable separation between 1 g and 2 g stars , making ngc6441 a typical example of a type i cluster for which we did not attempt to estimate the fraction of 1 g stars .",
    "the derived fractions of 1 g stars are listed in table  [ tab : w ] which also provides the total number of rgb stars included in the chromosome map and the ratio between the maximum radius of the analyzed stars and the cluster half light radius .",
    "radial gradients in the distribution of the 1 g and 2 g stars are indeed known to exist in some clusters ( e.g. , sollima et al.2007 ; bellini et al.2009 , 2013 ; milone et al .",
    "2012b ; cordero et al.2014 ; johnson & pilachowski 2010 ) hence this ratio provides a rough indication of the relative number of stars within the analyzed field of view with respect to the entire cluster stellar population .",
    "vs.@xmath35 diagrams presented in section  [ sub : g1g2 ] , where the pre - selected 1 g and 2 g stars are colored aqua and magenta , respectively .",
    "the histogram in the right panels show the distributions of the @xmath27 values .",
    "the red lines superimposed on the histograms of ngc6723 and ngc6205 are the best - fitting gaussians of the 1 g peak of the histogram . the fraction of 1 g stars is then calculated as the ratio of the area of the gaussian over that of the whole histogram .",
    "lower panels show the case of ngc6441 , a type i cluster , for which no clear distinction can be made between 1 g and 2 g stars and , correspondingly , we did not estimate the fraction of 1 g stars .",
    "see the text for details .",
    ", width=328 ]    a visual inspection of the maps shown in figures  [ fig : maps1 ]    [ fig : maps5 ] reveals that the @xmath36 extension of 1g- and 2g - stars may dramatically differ from one cluster to another .",
    "for example , in ngc6205 and ngc6752 the second generation is significantly more extended than the first one , while in ngc5024 and ngc5272 1 g and 2 g stars have a similar extension .    in order to quantify the @xmath36 extension of 1 g and 2 g stars",
    ", we determined the width of the 1(2)g , @xmath37 , as the difference between the 90@xmath10 and the 10@xmath10 percentile of the @xmath36 distribution of 1(2)g stars .",
    "the intrinsic width has been estimated by subtracting the color errors in quadrature ( including errors associated to the differential reddening corrections ) .",
    "the values of @xmath38 are also listed in table  [ tab : w ] .",
    "as already noted , the fact that @xmath38 is significantly larger than zero in most gcs , ( i.e. , the observed 1 g and 2 g widths are larger than measurement errors ) demonstrates that neither 1 g nor 2 g are consistent with a simple stellar population .",
    "this raises a new fundamental question : what are the chemical differences within the 1 g population of a gc ?",
    "the chemical characterization of the multiple populations identified on the chromosome maps is a key step to justify our identification of 1 g and 2 g stars as belonging to the first and the second generation and an indispensable tool to understand their origin . for this purpose",
    "the spectroscopic analysis of some stars included in our chromosome maps is needed . at present , we can rely only on existing data but additional extensive spectroscopic surveys are needed to shed further light on our photometric data .    to illustrate the case , in figure  [ fig : spettri ] we focus on ngc6121 as a prototype of a type i cluster .",
    "multiple stellar populations in ngc6121 have been widely studied , both photometrically ( e.g.marino et al.2008 ; milone et al.2014 ; nardiello et al.2015b ) and spectroscopically ( e.g.ivans et al.1999 ; marino et al.2008 , 2011 ; carretta et al.2009 , 2013 ) . from marino",
    "et al.(2008 ) , chemical analysis is available for eleven stars in common with our wfc3/uvis sample of rgb stars .",
    "panel ( b ) of figure  [ fig : spettri ] shows the sodium - oxygen anticorrelation , where some stars are oxygen rich and sodium poor , hence with primordial chemical composition , while others are enhanced in sodium and depleted in oxygen .",
    "these stars are shown , respectively , with aqua and magenta filled circles in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure  [ fig : spettri ] , showing that those we have called 1 g stars have indeed primordial chemical composition , while 2 g stars are na - rich and o - poor .",
    "no significant differences in iron content appear to exist among 1 g and 2 g stars in ngc6121 . in papers ii and iii we performed a similar chemical tagging for ngc7089 and for ngc2808 , by comparing the chromosome map of these clusters with the light - element abundances from yong et al.(2014 ) and carretta et al.(2006 ) , respectively .",
    "the chemical tagging of stars identified on the chromosome maps is clearly very limited at this time , but it could be greatly expanded by future spectroscopic observations targeting stars selected on the chromosome maps illustrated in this paper .",
    "the other panels in figure  [ fig : spettri ] refer to the type - ii gc ngc5286 and will be used in the next section dedicated to type ii clusters .",
    "vs.[o / fe ] anticorrelation is shown in panel ( b ) using the same symbols .",
    "stars for which an oxygen abundance determination is not available are plotted on the right side of the vertical line in this and in similar panels .",
    "the chromosome map of the type ii ngc5286 is shown in panel ( c ) , where red - rgb stars are colored red and black point are used for the remaining rgb stars .",

    "finally , in panel ( c ) the red - rgb stars are colored either aqua or red for being considered the first or the second generation ( 1g , r and 2g , r ) of the iron - rich population , while panel ( d ) shows the corresponding [ na / fe ] vs.[o / fe ] from marino et al.(2015).,width=302 ]",
    "in this section we present additional evidence to further explore and characterize the stellar - population content of type ii gcs , the most complex ones .",
    "a visual inspection of the chromosome map of ngc1851 ( figure  [ fig : maps2 ] ) reveals that the map itself appears to be split , with two 2 g sequences running vaguely parallel to each other , and a hint of a second 1 g sequence as well .",
    "to better understand the origin of such a complex pattern , in figure  [ fig : sgb1851 ] we show a collection of cmds for ngc1851 .",
    "the cmd in the upper - panel reveals that the sgb is clearly split into a bright and faint sgb ( red points in the insert for the latter ) which are connected to the blue and the red rgb , respectively .",
    "the rgb splitting was first noticed by han et al.(2009 ) using ground - based @xmath39 vs.@xmath40 photometry .",
    "the red - rgb stars have been colored red in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : sgb1851 ] .",
    "we used the same colors to represent the sample of selected faint - sgb stars in the @xmath41 vs. @xmath42 , @xmath43 vs.@xmath44 and @xmath45 vs.@xmath6 cmds , plotted in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : sgb1851 ] .",
    "these cmds not only demonstrate that the split sgb of ngc1851 is real , but also show that the faint sgb is visible also in cmds made with optical filters , like @xmath43 vs.@xmath44 , where stellar colors and luminosities are not significantly affected by light - element abundance variations ( see also milone et al.2008 ) .",
    "this indicates that faint - sgb stars are either enhanced in their c@xmath46n@xmath46o overall abundance , or are older than stars on the bright sgb by @xmath47gyr ( cassisi et al.2008 ; ventura et al.2009 ; marino et al.2011 ) .",
    "we emphasize that all type - ii clusters exhibit either split or multimodal sgbs when observed in both ultraviolet and optical filters , in contrast to type i gcs where multiple populations along the sgb are visible only in cmds that include ultraviolet bands ( milone et al.2008 ; marino et al.2009 ; piotto et al.2012 ) .    a collection of cmds for other type ii clusters ( namely , ngc362 , ngc1261 , ngc5139 , ngc5286 , ngc6656 , ngc6715 , ngc6093 , and ngc7078 ) is provided in figures  [ fig : sgb6656 ] to  [ fig : sgb6934 ] .",
    "every cmd shows the existence a faint sgb that evolves into a red rgb in the @xmath48 vs. @xmath49 cmd .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : sgb6388 ] , the faint - sgb - rgb connection is unclear for ngc6388 where the rgb split is visible only for stars brighter than @xmath50 .",
    "another possible exception is 47tucanae , in which there is no clear connection between multiple populations along the faint sgb and the rgb ( milone et al.2012b ) .",

    "the observed rgb width is significantly wider than expected from observational errors alone .",
    "this demonstrates that none of the studied gcs is consistent with hosting a simple stellar population . among them , @xmath32centauri , ( @xmath109 ) and ngc6535 ( @xmath110 ) are respectively the most - massive and the least - massive gc of the sample where multiple stellar populations have been detected to date . * for each cluster we have combined the @xmath5 pseudo - color and of the @xmath111 color to construct the @xmath112 vs.@xmath22 pseudo two - color diagram , or ` chromosome map ' , which maximizes the information on multiple stellar populations .",
    "* the chromosome maps of the majority of the gcs shows two major , well separated groups of stars , that we identify with first and second generation ( 1 g and 2 g ) .",
    "1 g stars are distributed around the origin of the chromosome map and span a narrow range of @xmath113 values .",
    "the group of 2 g stars that includes the remaining rgb stars span a wide range of both @xmath113 and @xmath22 values .",
    "such a clean 1g/2 g separation is not possible for a few gcs ( namely , ngc5927 ,",
    "ngc6304 , and ngc6441 ) , where the two sequences appear to be inextricably merged into a single sequence . collectively , these clusters ( with or without a clear 1g/2 g separation ) are called type i clusters .",
    "* the chromosome maps of a second group of clusters , called type ii clusters , show a more complex pattern , with an apparent split of both 1 g and 2 g sequences .",
    "a careful examination of multi - band cmds of all these clusters reveals that their sgbs are split also in purely optical cmds , while the sgb of type i gcs splits only in cmds based on ultraviolet filters . by using spectroscopic data from the literature",
    ", we showed that type ii clusters host populations that are also enriched in overall cno abundance ( c+n+o ) and heavy elements , such as iron and s - process elements .",
    "in particular , it is shown that the faint sgb corresponds to the stellar population enhanced in heavy elements ( e.g.marino et al.2011 ) .",
    "we argue that 1 ) split 1 g and 2 g sequences in the chromosome maps , 2 ) split sgbs and 3 ) non uniformity of the iron and s - elements abundances must be physically connected to each other .",
    "this evidence indicates that chromosome maps are an efficient tool to identify gcs with internal variations of heavy elements . in this way ,",

    "an extensive chemical tagging of multiple populations identified on the chromosome maps is now becoming a major requirement to further progress in the field of stellar populations in gcs .",
    "* noticeably , the color width of both 1 g and 2 g stars in most gcs is significantly wider than what observational errors would suggest .",
    "such evidence demonstrates that in most gcs even the first ( 1 g ) stellar generation is not consistent with a simple , chemically homogeneous stellar population .",

    "the rgb width mostly correlates with cluster metallicity . after removing the dependence on metallicity ,",
    "significant correlations emerge between the rgb width and cluster mass and luminosity .",
    "these results indicate that massive gcs exhibit more pronounced internal variations of helium and light elements compared with low - mass gcs . * for each cluster the f275w - f814w color width of 1 g and 2 g stars ( @xmath115 ) have been measured .",

    "<S> we use high - precision photometry of red - giant - branch ( rgb ) stars in 57 galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) , mostly from the  _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) uv legacy survey of galactic globular clusters \" , to identify and characterize their multiple stellar populations . for each cluster the pseudo two - color diagram ( or ` chromosome map ' ) is presented , built with a suitable combination of stellar magnitudes in the f275w , f336w , f438w and f814w filters that maximizes the separation between multiple populations . in the chromosome map of most gcs ( type i clusters ) , stars separate in two distinct groups that we identify with the first ( 1 g ) and the second generation ( 2 g ) . </S>",
    "<S> this identification is further supported by noticing that 1 g stars have primordial ( oxygen - rich , sodium - poor ) chemical composition , whereas 2 g stars are enhanced in sodium and depleted in oxygen . </S>",
    "<S> this 1g-2 g separation is not possible for a few gcs where the two sequences have apparently merged into an extended , continuous sequence . in some gcs ( type ii clusters ) </S>",
    "<S> the 1 g and/or the 2 g sequences appear to be split , hence displaying more complex chromosome maps . </S>",
    "<S> these clusters exhibit multiple sgbs also in purely optical color - magnitude diagrams , with the fainter sgb joining into a red rgb which is populated by stars with enhanced heavy - element abundance . </S>",
    "<S> we measure the rgb width by using appropriate colors and pseudo - colors . </S>",
    "<S> when the metallicity dependence is removed , the rgb width correlates with the cluster mass . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of 1 g stars ranges from @xmath08% to @xmath067% and anticorrelates with the cluster mass , indicating that incidence and complexity of the multiple population phenomenon both increase with cluster mass .    </S>",
