    "besides an experimental search for an explanation of the phenomenon of electroweak symmetry breaking and new physics beyond the standard model , high energies and luminosities of current and future particle accelerators provide a possibility to observe rare processes with heavy quarks .",
    "an interesting topic here is a study of physics of doubly heavy baryons .",
    "an analysis of dynamics of these baryons can play a fundamental role in an extraction of primary parameters of weak quark interactions . due to distinctions between the qcd effects inside the doubly and singly heavy hadrons",
    ", one may strictly constrain incalculable nonperturbative quantities , entering different schemes of calculations .",
    "the real possibility of such experimental measurements was recently confirmed by cdf collaboration by the first observation of @xmath1 meson @xcite .",
    "as predicted theoretically @xcite , this long - lived state of @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks has the production cross sections , mass and decay rates , which are compatible with the characteristic values for the doubly heavy hadrons .",
    "thus , the experimental search for the doubly heavy baryons can also be successful .",
    "of course , such the search would be more strongly motivated if it would be supported by modern theoretical studies and evaluations of basic characteristics for the doubly heavy baryons .",
    "some steps forward this program were already done .",
    "first , the production cross sections of doubly heavy baryons in hadron collisions at high energies of colliders and in fixed target experiments were calculated in the framework of perturbative qcd for the hard processes and factorization of soft term related to the nonperturbative binding of heavy quarks @xcite .",
    "second , the lifetimes and branching fractions of some inclusive decay modes were evaluated in the operator product expansion combined with the effective theory of heavy quarks , which results in series over the inverse heavy quark masses and relative velocities of heavy quarks inside the doubly heavy diquark @xcite .",
    "third , the families of doubly heavy baryons , which contain a set of narrow excited levels in addition to the ground state , were described in the framework of potential models @xcite .",
    "the picture of spectra , obtained in this analysis , is very similar to that of heavy quarkonia .",
    "fourth , the qcd and nrqcd sum rules @xcite were explored for the two - point baryonic currents in order to calculate the masses and couplings of doubly heavy baryons @xcite . and",
    "fifth , there are papers , where exclusive semileptonic and some nonleptonic decay modes of doubly heavy baryons in the framework of potential models and within the bethe - salpeter approach were analyzed @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we estimate form - factors for the semileptonic decays of doubly heavy baryons together with semileptonic and some nonleptonic decay modes in the framework of three - point nrqcd sum rules for the case of spin @xmath4 - spin @xmath4 - baryon transitions only .",
    "the estimates of contributions due to spin @xmath4-spin @xmath5-baryon transitions are also given the basis of qcd superflavor symmetry , emerging in the limit of very large heavy quark masses .",
    "in the limit of zero recoil we derive the spin symmetry relations on the form - factors , governing the semileptonic transitions of doubly heavy baryons .",
    "the use of these symmetry relations greatly simplifies further evaluation of form - factors for doubly heavy baryon transitions .",
    "a detailed analysis of baryon couplings , needed to model the phenomenological part of three - point sum rules is also provided .",
    "our further exposition of the obtained results is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss our choice of interpolating currents between vacuum and corresponding doubly heavy baryon state and give numerical estimates of baryonic couplings in the framework of two - point nrqcd sum rules .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the description of the method used to calculate the form - factors of interest . here",
    "we present a derivation of spin symmetry relations between form - factors in the limit of maximal invariant mass of leptonic pair and give analytical expressions for corresponding double spectral densities . in section 4 we present numerical estimates of the form - factors studied together with predictions for the semileptonic and some nonleptonic decay modes . and",
    "finally , section 5 contains our conclusion .",
    "in this section we describe steps , required for the evaluation of baryonic constants , as they will be needed later to model the phenomenological part of three - point sum rules .",
    "the question , which should be solved first is the choice of the corresponding interpolating currents for the baryons under consideration .",
    "so , in the next subsection we discuss their various choices and comment on the merits of the prescription , used in this paper .",
    "as was mentioned in introduction , in this work we consider only spin @xmath4 - spin @xmath4 transitions of doubly heavy baryons .",
    "hence , the discussion of baryonic currents later in this subsection will be restricted to this case . for baryons , containing two heavy quarks ,",
    "there are two types of interpolating currents :    \\1 ) the prescription with the explicit spin structure of the heavy diquark from the very beginning is given by @xmath6q^k\\varepsilon_{ijk},\\nonumber\\\\ j_{\\xi_{qq}^{\\diamond } } & = & [ q^{it}c\\tau\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}^m q^j]\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_m\\gamma_5 q^k\\varepsilon_{ijk } , \\label{def}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath7 is the charge conjugation matrix with the properties @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 are color indices and @xmath11 is a matrix in the flavor space .",
    "\\2 ) the currents , which require a further symmetrization of heavy diquark wave function , have the form @xmath12 the currents of the second type can be easily related to those of first type by the fierz rearrangement of quark fields and the further symmetrization or antisymmetrization of diquark wave - function , depending on the diquark spin state .",
    "the first type of these currents was considered in @xcite , while the currents of second type were discussed in @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of form - factors , describing semileptonic decays of doubly heavy baryons , what is the goal of this paper , is much easy if we use the currents of the second type and make the symmetrization or antisymmetrization of diquark wave - function at the end of calculation on the level of form - factors .",
    "this procedure will become clear in the section with our numerical results for the exclusive decay modes of doubly heavy baryons .",
    "the reasons here are the manifest symmetry relations for form - factors , discussed by us later and rather simple calculations of various spectral densities for three - point correlation functions , which can also be done in full qcd framework without performing complicated angular integrations .",
    "however , as was shown by the authors of @xcite , for the second type of currents it is difficult , in general , to achieve a stability of sum rules predictions for the both extracted mass and coupling of doubly heavy baryons .",
    "to the same time , all these difficulties are absent for the currents of first type .",
    "so , the conclusion , which one may do here , is that , the appropriate choice of baryonic currents depends on the problem , which you would like to solve .    thus , in view of the lack of experimental information on the masses of doubly heavy baryons we will use for them the results of two - point nrqcd sum rules for the first type of currents @xcite . taking these mass values as input , we calculate further the baryonic couplings of the second type .",
    "next , let us discuss the couplings of strange heavy baryons , as they are appear in the semileptonic decays of some doubly heavy baryons .",
    "the currents , describing these hadrons , also classified according to the symmetry properties of light diquark wave - function .",
    "there are two spin @xmath4 @xmath13-type ( antisymmetric in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 - quarks denotes one of the light quarks @xmath16 or @xmath17 . ] ) and two @xmath18-type ( symmetric in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 - quarks ) hqet currents , namely @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the hqet heavy quark spinor , moving with velocity @xmath21 .",
    "the baryons , described by these currents , belong to the same su(4 ) multiplet , that have as its lowest level the @xmath22 su(3 ) octet . as",
    ", these hadrons contain only one heavy quark , they belong to the second level of the mentioned su(4 ) multiplet .",
    "this level splits apart into two su(3 ) multiplets , a @xmath23 , states of which @xmath24 are antisymmetric under interchange of two light quarks and thus described by @xmath13 - type currents , and @xmath25 , states of which @xmath26 are symmetric under interchange of light quark and described by @xmath27 - type currents .",
    "actually , there may be some mixing between the pure @xmath23 and @xmath25 states to form the physical @xmath24 and @xmath28 states , @xmath29 and @xmath30 quantum numbers . ] .",
    "so , in what follows we will not distinguish between @xmath24 and @xmath28 - baryons and will exploit the fact that both states have non - vanishing overlap with @xmath31 current .",
    "in other words , what we suppose to calculate is the semileptonic branching ratio of some of doubly heavy baryons into both @xmath24 and @xmath28 - baryons .",
    "now , let us briefly describe the two - point nrqcd sum rules , used for their evaluation .",
    "we start from the correlator of two baryonic currents with the half spin @xmath32 performing the ope expansion of this correlation function , we get a series , different terms of which give us the contributions of operators with various dimensions .",
    "so , for @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) functions we have the following expressions @xmath35 to obtain theoretical expressions for the wilson coefficients , standing in front of different operators , one typically uses the dispersion relation @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 denotes the imaginary part in the physical region of corresponding wilson coefficients in nrqcd and @xmath40 are the heavy quark masses and @xmath41 is four - velocity of the baryon under consideration . ] .",
    "the calculation of spectral densities @xmath39 proceeds through the use of cutkosky rules @xcite and for the case of @xmath42 current and different quark masses was done in the qcd framework in @xcite .",
    "here we use the results of this work .",
    "the needed nrqcd spectral densities were obtained by simple nrqcd expansion of corresponding qcd expressions and the results of this expansion could be found in appendix  a.    to relate the nrqcd correlators to hadrons , we use the dispersion representation for the two - point function with the physical spectral density , given by appropriate resonance and continuum part .",
    "the coupling constants of doubly heavy baryons are defined by the following expression @xmath43 where @xmath44 and the spinor field with four - velocity @xmath21 and mass @xmath45 satisfies the equation @xmath46 .",
    "we suppose that the continuum part , starting from the threshold value @xmath47 , is equal to that of calculated in the framework of nrqcd .",
    "then , equalizing the correlators , calculated in nrqcd and given by the physical states , the integrations above @xmath47 cancel each other in both sides of sum rules relation .",
    "further , we write down the correlators at the deep under - threshold point @xmath48 at @xmath49 .    introducing the following notation for the @xmath50-th moment of two - point correlation function @xmath51 and using the approximation of single bound state pole",
    ", we can write the following relation @xmath52}|^2\\frac{1}{m_h^{n+1-i}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from which one can read off the corresponding expression for the baryon coupling in the moment scheme @xmath53}|^2 = { \\cal m}_n^i m_h^{n+1-i},\\ ] ] where we see the dependence of sum rules on the scheme parameter @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , we will tend to find the region of parameter values , where , first , the result is stable under the variation of moment number @xmath50 , and , second , the both correlators @xmath54 and @xmath55 reproduce equal values of coupling constants . in the qcd sum rule analysis of @xcite",
    "there was a problem , that values of baryon coupling constants , obtained from @xmath54 and @xmath55 correlation functions significantly differ . to cure this problem , in @xcite",
    "it was proposed to include in calculations also contributions , coming from the ope expansion for the correlator of two quark fields @xcite @xmath56.\\ ] ] with an account of these corrections the quark condensate contribution to moments gets modified @xmath57 the derivation of two - point hqet sum rules for the heavy baryons with the strangeness follows the same lines as that for baryons with two heavy quarks .",
    "here we only comment on the differences . to obtain the hqet expressions for the spectral densities we again use the qcd result of @xcite .",
    "however , the transition between the qcd expressions for the doubly heavy baryons and hqet expressions for the heavy baryons with the strangeness is more intricate .",
    "first , we should take a limit when one of the heavy quark masses goes to zero and second , we should allow this quark to condense .",
    "we have calculated explicitly the @xmath15 -quark condensate contribution to the both @xmath54 and @xmath55 correlation functions and subtracted @xmath58 poles from gluon condensate contribution , related to the strange quark condensate due to the following heavy quark expansion @xmath59 the appearing logarithmic singularities can be related to the mixed quark condensate with the help of the same heavy quark expansion @xmath60 and , finally , one must subtract the nonsingular gluon condensate contribution , belonging to the quark condensate , what can be easily done with the calculated explicit expression for quark condensate contribution .",
    "the resulted hqet spectral densities for the case of ordinary baryons with strangeness were collected by us in appendix a. for the strange quark condensate contribution , as in the case of light quark condensate , we also take into account the corrections , coming from the ope expansion for the correlator of two strange quark fields @xcite @xmath61 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & im_s\\delta^{ab}x_{\\mu } \\gamma^{\\mu}_{ij}\\langle\\bar ss\\rangle\\left[\\frac{1}{48}+\\frac{x^2}{24 ^ 2}\\left(\\frac{3m_0 ^ 2}{4}-m_s^2\\right)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with this corrections the @xmath15-quark contribution to the moments for the @xmath54 and @xmath55 correlation functions has the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 now , having all theoretical expressions for baryon coupling constants in the moment scheme , we will proceed in the next subsection with the numerical estimates .",

    "next point , we would like to discuss , is an account of coulomb corrections inside the doubly heavy diquark .",
    "as is well known , these corrections give large contribution to baryon coupling constants and are essential for relative contributions of perturbative and condensate terms to the correlator @xcite .",
    "with a good accuracy at low or moderate values of moment number , the effect of coulomb interactions can be written as overall zommerfeld factor in front of perturbative spectral density of heavy subsystem for the square of baryon coupling .",
    "but , as it was shown in @xcite , the same zommerfeld factors should be taken into account in calculations of three - point correlation functions considered later in this paper .",
    "it occurs , that for the form - factors for the semileptonic transitions of doubly heavy baryons these corrections cancel each other in average .",
    "so , the calculation of desired form - factors for the doubly heavy baryons can be consistently performed without accounting for coulomb corrections either , provided we neglect them both in the two - point and three - point sum rules .",
    "this is the approach , we will follow in the present work for the evaluation of form - factors .",

    "as we already mentioned , for the second type of currents used here , we evaluate the coupling constants only and use the masses of doubly heavy baryons , calculated by us previously @xcite , as inputs @xmath73 which are in agreement with the values obtained in the framework of potential models . for the masses of heavy baryons with the strangeness , appearing as products of semileptonic decays of some of the doubly heavy baryons , we use the following values : @xmath74 figs .",

    "this representation can be explicitly written in terms of nine - component vector with the four - velocity @xmath21 :    @xmath115    where @xmath116 satisfies the constraint @xmath117 and the effective lagrangian for this field is @xmath118 where @xmath119 is a 9@xmath1209 mass matrix , given by the following expression : @xmath121 and @xmath122 here @xmath123 is the usual metric tensor .",
    "next , to make connection with the hadronic states , one considers a tensor product of @xmath124 with one light antiquark field .",
    "thus , this hadronic supermultiplet puts together singly heavy mesons and doubly heavy antibaryons . however , such supermultiplet is not completely flavor - independent even in the heavy quark mass limit , as there remains internal mass - dependent heavy di - antiquark dynamics .",
    "the singly heavy baryons with the strangeness in the discussed approach belong to the different supermultiplet and this fact should be taken into account , when calculating form - factors for the semileptonic transitions between doubly heavy and singly heavy baryons .",
    "such analysis within the framework of potential models was performed previously by m.a.sanchis-lozano @xcite for the case of @xmath125-baryon decays .",
    "there , to calculate the form - factors , it was assumed that the latter are given by the overlap of coulomb diquark wave - functions with small non - perturbative corrections , given by the presence of a light quark in the baryons under consideration .",
    "it is just the approach we have used in our pm estimates . to reduce the number of independent form - factors ,",
    "there was performed an analysis of spin - symmetry relations between various form - factors in the limit of zero recoil .",
    "the author , using different arguments , had came to the same conclusion as we have did in the present work .",
    "that is , all semileptonic transitions of doubly heavy baryons are governed by the only universal function , an analogue of isgur - wise function .",
    "the numerical results on the normalization of isgur - wise function at zero recoil completely agree with our estimates both in the framework of potential models and nrqcd sum rules .",
    "the given predictions for the semileptonic decay modes of @xmath126-baryons nicely agree with the ones presented in this paper , taking into account correction factor due to the wrong values of @xmath127-baryon lifetime used in that paper .",
    "there is also a paper , where the diquark semileptonic transitions where calculated within the bethe - salpeter approach .",
    "however , the numerical results presented in this paper are very strange .",
    "it is suffice to say , that , for example , according to these results the semileptonic branching ratios of @xmath128-baryon decays should be approximately 50 % , what is very unlikely .",
    "to finish the discussion of the obtained results we would like to note , that the latter are also in agreement with the estimates of inclusive decay channels performed by us previously @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have presented the analysis of exclusive decays of doubly heavy baryons in the framework of nrqcd sum rules .",
    "we have provided complete numerical study of baryonic couplings and semileptonic form - factors .",
    "the values of semileptonic and some nonleptonic exclusive modes are also given .",
    "to conclude , we would like to discuss what also can be and should be done in the study of exclusive decays of doubly heavy baryons .",
    "first , it will be instructive to perform the similar analysis for the baryon currents of the first type .",
    "we have check , that these two schemes of calculation give the similar results only in the case of @xmath128-baryon decays .",
    "second , one may perform an analysis of doubly heavy baryon exclusive decays in full qcd and not relay on the pole resonance model for the form - factors .",
    "we plan to present the results of such analysis in nearest future . and , third one may try to calculate the lifetimes of doubly heavy baryons in the framework of qcd sum rules .",
    "it is a very interesting task , as we will explicitly see the effect of large nonspectator effects , studied previously in the ope framework , on various exclusive modes .",
