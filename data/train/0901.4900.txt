    ", the mg model links dimerized vbs states and dimerized spin chains where the frustration is forced by next  nearest neighbor interactions . for @xmath6 , however , this exact link is not given anymore .",
    "the vbs states seem not to belong to the phase diagrams of the frustrated heisenberg chains . nonetheless , vbs states are often used as toy model states in order to discuss frustration in quantum spin chains ,",
    "see for the spin 3/2 case for example refs . @xcite and references therein .",
    "parent hamiltonians , however , are only known for the majumdar ",

    "most recently , vbs states have attracted renewed interest . they have been generalized to special unitary su(@xmath7 ) symmetry  @xcite , to special orthogonal symmetry so(@xmath7 )  @xcite , and to symplectic symmetry sp(@xmath7 )  @xcite .",
    "a supersymmetric extension of vbs states has been proposed recently  @xcite .",
    "dimer states .",
    "( a ) and ( b ) are the two  fold degenerate partially dimerized vbs states .",
    "each state can be seen as the covering of the aklt state with one of the majumdar ",

    "the lines between two spins 1/2 denote a singlet bond . ]    in this letter , we present a parent hamiltonian for the partially or weakly dimerized vbs states ( see fig.[fig : s=3/2-dimer - states ] for the illustration of the spin 3/2 case ) . for spin 1/2",
    ", this hamiltonian reduces to the mg hamiltonian .",
    "the particular importance of the spin 3/2 hamiltonian is given by its possible realization in the impurity induced dimer phase in cr8ni as proposed recently  @xcite .",
    "this molecular nanomagnet comprises eight chromium(iii ) ions with spin 3/2 and one nickel(ii ) ion with spin 1 .",
    "the ground state of this cr8ni ring was shown to be well understood in the vbs picture  @xcite by means of numerical simulations .",
    "likewise , the hamiltonian can be implemented within dmrg , as only standard spin interaction terms are present .",
    "this will allow for extensive numerical studies complementary to known results for the spin 3/2 @xmath3@xmath4 model with antiferromagnetic @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the letter is organized as follows : we start with a brief discussion of general properties of vbs states .",
    "then we introduce the @xmath2 dimer hamiltonian which has the weakly dimerized vbs states shown in fig.[fig : s=3/2-dimer - states ] as ground states and show that these are the unique ground states .",
    "we show that the lowest lying excitations are fractionally quantized spin 1/2 spinons .",
    "then we discuss the connection to the dimerized phase in the frustrated spin 3/2 heisenberg model and static spin ",
    "spin correlations .",
    "finally , we show that the explicit construction of the hamiltonian as well as all qualitative results generalize to the case of arbitrary half  integral spin @xmath0 .",
    "in 1987 , affleck , kennedy , lieb and tasaki ( aklt ) introduced a spin 1 hamiltonian which was constructed as a sum over a local projection operator .",
    "its unique ground state can be understood as follows : on each lattice site are two spins 1/2 symmetrically coupled into an effective spin 1 , while each of the spins 1/2 is antisymmetrically coupled to a spin 1/2 on its neighboring lattice sites , either to the right or the left . for an illustration see fig.[fig : s=1-states ]  ( a ) .",
    "this state was called a valence bond solid .",
    "we wish to understand as a vbs all states consisting of local singlet bonds .",
    "in particular , we call the mg states and the spin 1 dimer states ( see fig.[fig : s=1-states ]  ( b ) ) also vbs states even though they break translational invariance spontaneously",
    ".     vbs states : ( a ) is the translational invariant aklt state and ( b ) is one the of two  fold degenerate dimer states .",
    "the second dimer state can be obtained by shifting the state ( b ) by one lattice spacing to the right . ]",
    "one of the main features of vbs states is that we are able to write down their wave functions explicitly as easily as we illustrate them .",
    "schwinger bosons  @xcite constitute a convenient way to formulate spin @xmath0 representations .",
    "arovas  @xcite applied for the first time schwinger bosons to the aklt model and to vbs states in general .",
    "the spin @xmath0 operators @xmath8 are expressed by bosonic creation and annihilation operators which obey the standard commutation relations @xmath9=[b , b^{\\dagger}]=1 $ ] while all other commutators vanish .",
    "the spin quantum number @xmath0 is given by @xmath10 and the general spin @xmath0 state is defined as @xmath11 the spin 1/2 states are thus given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the difference between the fermionic operators and schwinger bosons shows up only when two or more creation operators act on the same site .",
    "while fermion operators create a singlet configuration @xmath14 , schwinger bosons create a totally symmetric representation .",
    "the elegance of schwinger bosons come to light when defining the general spin @xmath0 vbs state : @xmath15 where @xmath16 creates on sites @xmath17 and @xmath18 a singlet bond .",
    "we recover for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , the mg states .",
    "the @xmath21 aklt state can thus be written as @xmath22 and the spin 1 dimer state ( fig.[fig : s=1-states ]  ( b ) ) as @xmath23 .",
    "obviously , @xmath24 and there are always @xmath25 vbs states . for half ",
    "integer @xmath0 , there are always @xmath26 pairs of dimerized states with different strengths of dimerization",
    ". for integer @xmath0 , there are @xmath0 pairs of dimerized states and one additional aklt state @xmath27 .",
    "note that there is always a pair of completely dimerized vbs states regardless @xmath0 .",
    "we stress again that the schwinger bosons ensures the symmetric projection on every lattice site .    in this letter",
    ", we are mainly interested in @xmath2 vbs states .",
    "there are four of them : completely dimerized states @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( the latter is shown in fig.[fig : s=3/2-fullydimerized ] ) and weakly dimerized states @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( both are shown in fig.[fig : s=3/2-dimer - states ] ) . for the weakly dimerized vbs states we present in the next paragraph a parent hamiltonian .",
    "vbs states , say @xmath29 . by shifting of one lattice spacing to the right",
    "we obtain the second dimer state @xmath28 . ]",
    "we wish to mention that one can easily define a spin-@xmath0 hamiltonian in terms of local projection operators annihilating all @xmath25 vbs states .",
    "it involves three  site interactions and reduces for @xmath1 to the well  known mg hamiltonian . for @xmath6",
    ", however , this is not a parent hamiltonian anymore as it has all spin @xmath0 vbs states as groundstates .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath32",
    "now we present the hamiltonian which uniquely singles out the weakly dimerized vbs states @xmath30 and @xmath31 as shown in fig.[fig : s=3/2-dimer - states ] .",
    "this hamiltonian is a sum of projection operators @xmath34 which project onto the spin @xmath0 subspace on @xmath35 neighboring sites .",
    "@xmath36 \\big . & + a_{\\frac{9}{2 } } p^{({\\boldsymbol{\\frac{9}{2}}})}_{i , i+1,i+2 } + \\beta \\ , p^{({\\boldsymbol{3}})}_{i , i+1 } ~\\big ) \\end{split}\\ ] ] remarkably , the last projection operator acts on two neighboring sites while the other operators act on three neighboring sites .",
    "we decompose , hence , the hamiltonian into two parts , @xmath37 acting on three neighboring sites and @xmath38 acting on neighboring sites .",
    "we are able to express @xmath39 by means of spin operators as follows , @xmath40 the second part , @xmath38 , corresponds to the nearest neighbor bilinear  biquadratic  bicubic heisenberg model with certain parameters , @xmath41 .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] finally , the parent hamiltonian can be written for @xmath42 as @xmath43 note that this hamiltonian can be implemented both within exact diagonalization ( ed ) and dmrg .",
    "terms like @xmath44 and @xmath45 are standard terms .",
    "more complicated terms like @xmath46 or @xmath47 are also straight forward to implement .",
    "the reader may notice that dmrg has been successfully applied by several authors  @xcite to investigate antiferromagnetic spin 3/2 chains .    in the following we will prove that has a two  fold degenerate zero - energy ground state , @xmath48 the proof is exceedingly simple :",
    "first we will verify that @xmath37 has the four @xmath2 vbs states as unique zero  energy groundstates , second we will show that @xmath38 exhibits a huge ( actually an infinite ) ground state degeneracy ( also with zero energy ) which contains the weakly dimerized vbs states but not the completely dimerized vbs states .",
    "consequently , the additive term @xmath49 in does not affect the weakly dimerized vbs state while the fully dimerized state will be lifted to higher energy .",
    "this lifting is controlled by the parameter @xmath42 and can be tuned continuously .",
    "the auxiliary hamiltonian @xmath50 has the four @xmath2 vbs states as exact zero  energy ground states , @xmath51 .     at the @xmath52point ( momentum @xmath53 ) in the brillouin zone .",
    "the data was obtained on a chain with @xmath54 lattice sites and periodic boundary conditions . as the @xmath52point",
    "is considered , there are only two of the four groundstates for @xmath55 .",
    "the other groundstates ( @xmath31 and @xmath29 ) are located at @xmath56 in the brillouin zone . for increasing @xmath42 the fully dimerized vbs state @xmath28",
    "is increased in energy .",
    "around @xmath57 it crosses with the first excited state of @xmath37 which is in some sense also the first excited state of @xmath58 .",
    "this crossing is expected , but the value @xmath57 depends on the system size and will decrease for larger @xmath59 . ]",
    "this can be seen as follows : consider three neighboring sites of one of the four vbs states ( no matter which of the vbs states , completely or partially dimerized ones ) : there are always three singlet bonds and three individual spin 1/2 representations , @xmath60 . in general , the tensor decomposition of three spin 3/2 is given by @xmath61 .",
    "the projection onto the subspace with representation @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 singles out the four vbs states as ground states .",
    "we can express the local projection operator in terms of spin operators as done in equation .",
    "now we consider the nearest neighbor projection operator @xmath65 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath66 has an infinite ground state degeneracy .",
    "this can be seen as every state is a ground state where two spins 1/2 per site are in the `` aklt configuration '' and the third spin 1/2 is `` free '' .",
    "the partially dimerized states obviously belong to this set of ground states while the completely dimerized states are not ground states of @xmath38 .",
    "consequently , the term @xmath49 in lifts the completely dimerized states continuously to higher energy as @xmath67 is increased .",
    "the partially dimerized states remain as unique ground states .",
    "this scenario is shown in fig.[fig : ham - beta ] for a chain with @xmath54 sites and periodic boundary conditions where the data was obtained by means of exact diagonalization .",
    "for open boundary conditions the situation changes : the dimer states are no global singlets anymore , edge states emerge , and the dimer states are fourfold ( singlet and triplet ) and ninefold ( singlet , triplet , and quintuplet ) degenerate . when cutting the dimer states , either one individual spin 1/2 or two symmetrically coupled spins 1/2 remain which are not coupled in local singlet bonds ( the two different cuts correspond to the two ground states in case of periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "the _ dangling _ spins at the edges cause the degeneracy of the dimer ground states . for the first situation ( @xmath59 even ) the two edge spins couple into a singlet and a triplet , @xmath68 , yielding a four  fold degenerate dimer state . for the second situation ( @xmath59 even ) , the two spins 1/2 at each edge are symmetrically coupled into a triplet , @xmath69 .",
    "hence , the two edge spins carry spin 1 and will be coupled into singlet , triplet , and quintuplet , @xmath70 , yielding a ninefold degenerate ground state .",
    "this manifold degeneracy of the ground state in case of open boundary conditions can be nicely observed numerically , when looking at the different @xmath71subspaces .",
    "as already discussed , we are able to define the model hamiltonian @xmath72 ( see eq . ) acting on three neighboring sites for arbitrary spin @xmath0 exhibiting a @xmath73fold degenerate ground state , the @xmath25 possible spin @xmath0 vbs states  @xcite . for @xmath1 , this model corresponds to the mg hamiltonian , for @xmath21 to the hamiltonian proposed by sen and surendran  @xcite , and for @xmath2 to @xmath37 of equation . in all of these hamiltonians ,",
    "the lowest lying excitation will be a pair of deconfined @xmath1 spinons .",
    "this is easy to understand as the spinons emerge in this models as domain walls interpolating between different ground states . as the hilbert space of spin @xmath0 antiferromagnets",
    "is spanned by spin flips which carry spin 1 , the spin 1/2 excitation has to be seen as a fractionally quantized excitation .",
    "we illustrate this situation for the hamiltonian @xmath37 in fig.[fig : exc - h1 ] .     and @xmath28 while the right spinon constitutes a domain wall between @xmath28 and @xmath30 .",
    "( c ) for clarity we have fixed the left spinon . from the sequence ( a ) ,",
    "( b ) , and ( c ) we note that the spinons can occupy only half the number of sites ( see the explanation in the text ) . the reader should notice that the `` states '' shown in ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) are not exact eigenstates of @xmath37 but the cartoons provide a good intuitive picture of the low  lying excitations . ]    in the cartoon fig.[fig : exc - h1 ] , we notice another interesting point : even though the spinons are free they can only occupy every second lattice site .",
    "if there are only a few spinons in a chain the number of orbitals available to them is roughly half the number of sites reflecting their fractionally quantized character .",
    "now the question remains whether this picture of free spinon excitations holds for the hamiltonian @xmath58 considered in this paper . as we mentioned above , relevant in our cartoons are only the number of singlet bonds between neighboring sites while the order of singlet bonds is irrelevant .",
    "hence , a vbs state is identified uniquely by @xmath74 and @xmath7 .",
    "the cartoon in fig.[fig : exc - hdimer ] suggests that elementary excitations of are also spin 1/2 spinons .",
    "this is not unexpected as the hamiltonian is the hamiltonian @xmath37 plus an additional term @xmath38 which lifts up the fully dimerized states out of the ground state manifold .",
    "altogether , the whole consideration of deconfined spinon excitations in the spin 3/2 dimer model is consistent with the picture that the origin of the haldane gap  @xcite is a confinement force between spinons  @xcite .",
    "the generic @xmath2 spin chain , the nearest neighbor heisenberg model , is known not to exhibit a haldane gap and , hence , the spinons can not be confined .",
    "while the generic spin 3/2 chain has a gapless excitation spectrum , the hamiltonians @xmath58 and @xmath37 as well as all spin @xmath0 hamiltonians mentioned at the beginning of this section exhibit a gapped excitation spectrum as it costs a finite energy to break a singlet bond .",
    "this energy cost survives in the thermodynamic limit but it is not haldane s gap .     and @xmath31 .",
    "the state on the right hand side of the spinon excitations is identical to the state in fig.[fig : s=3/2-dimer - states]b as explained in the text . ]",
    "the hamiltonian has the weakly dimerized states @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , as exact ground states .",
    "dimerization is usually caused by frustration .",
    "in one spatial dimension this is realized in a next  nearest neighbor heisenberg model , @xmath75 , when the next nearest neighbor coupling @xmath76 exceeds a critical value @xmath77 .",
    "the spin 1/2 heisenberg model is characterized by a critical phase for @xmath78  @xcite .",
    "the system undergoes a second  order phase transition to a dimerized phase for @xmath79 . for @xmath80",
    ", the hamiltonian corresponds to the majumdar ",
    "ghosh model exhibiting the exact dimer states @xmath81 and @xmath82 as ground states .",
    "notice , that the dimerization becomes exact in the thermodynamic limit only .",
    "that is , the ground state becomes perfectly degenerate due to the broken translation symmetry .",
    "one ground state has total momentum @xmath53 while the other has @xmath83 . except for @xmath80 ,",
    "the ground state degeneracy is not intact in the finite system .",
    "nevertheless , ground states in the dimer phase are known to exhibit a good overlap with the mg ground states .    for the spin 3/2 heisenberg model with next nearest neighbor interaction @xmath76 , roth and schollwck found the phase transition to the dimerized phase at @xmath84  @xcite .",
    "they further computed the maximum dimerization for @xmath85 .",
    "we expect that the ground states in the spin 3/2 dimer phase correspond to the weakly dimerized states rather than the completely dimerized states , our hamiltonian can be seen as the @xmath2analogue of the mg model .",
    "we can further conjecture that the states @xmath30 and @xmath31 will have an excellent overlap with the ground states in the dimer phase investigated by roth and schollwck for sufficiently large system lengths .",
    "such system lengths are not computable within ed .",
    "nevertheless , in principle the hamiltonian is implementable within dmrg as pointed out above and the calculation of overlaps might be feasible .",
    "furthermore , it might be interesting to compute the static spin  spin correlations within dmrg .",
    "correlations are known to decay quite fast in dimer phases , for the mg states , however , the correlations decay abruptly , @xmath86 .",
    "hence , the question remains for the spin 3/2 dimer model whether the spin  spin correlations decay fast , say exponentially , or abruptly .",
    "we are able to formulate the generalized version of the hamiltonian to arbitrary half  integer @xmath0 .",
    "it involves interactions between three neighboring sites and is formulated in terms of projection operators as follows : @xmath88 we have restricted @xmath0 to be half ",
    "integer and @xmath42 .",
    "the two  fold degenerate ground state of @xmath89 is explicitly given by @xmath90 by means of . for @xmath1",
    "the weakly dimerized states reduce to the well  known majumdar  ghosh ( mg ) states ( in this case , the `` weakly dimerized '' states coincide with the completely dimerized states ) .",
    "since the second sum in does not contribute for @xmath1 the hamiltonian reduces to the sum over the projection operator onto the @xmath2 subspace on three neighboring sites which is known to be the mg hamiltonian . for @xmath2 ,",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath89 is equivalent to . for larger",
    "@xmath0 , @xmath62 , we find easily the hamiltonian @xmath91 which has a @xmath25fold degenerate ground state manifold consisting of all vbs states . again",
    "the term @xmath92 lifts up all vbs to higher energy except the weakly dimerized states . for @xmath62 , the hamiltonian @xmath92 is given by @xmath93 $ ] .",
    "although one is restricted to small chain lengths when @xmath0 becomes @xmath94 or larger , all these terms are implementable within ed and the @xmath62 spin  dimer model @xmath95 might be verified numerically .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a parent hamiltonian for the weakly dimerized vbs states with arbitrary half ",
    "integral @xmath0 . for spin 3/2 , we have explained its construction explicitly and have discussed its main properties .",
    "these weakly dimerized spin 3/2 vbs states might be realized in the impurity induced dimer phase of the ground state of the molecular nanomagnet cr8ni .",
    "the path for further numerical consideration has been pointed out . finally , the generalization to spin @xmath0 has been explained .",
