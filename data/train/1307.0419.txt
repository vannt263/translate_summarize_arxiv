    "the globular cluster ( gc ) system in the milky way is formed by around 150 known objects .",
    "the galactic gcs are old systems , representing a fossil record of the galaxy , and can provide us with interesting hints about its formation and its early evolution . as such ,",
    "a proper understanding of the galactic gcs physical parameters is of considerable importance .",
    "photometrically , the tools more used to study the galactic gcs and get reliable values for their distances , metallicities , ages , extinctions and other characteristics , have been the analysis of their color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and the analysis of the light - curves of their member variable stars .",
    "the most common and characteristic variable type of star in gc is the rr  lyrae type .",
    "these variables lie in the instability strip region that crosses the horizontal branch ( hb ) in the cmd of the cluster .",
    "rr  lyrae in galactic gcs are classified in two main types according to the radial mode in which they pulsate : rrab ( or rr0 ) pulsate in the fundamental radial mode , and rrc ( or rr1 ) pulsate in the first overtone radial mode .",
    "an interesting characteristic of galactic gcs in which rr  lyrae variables are present , is the so - called oosterhoff dichotomy @xcite : the galactic gcs tend toward clumping in two main groups , oosterhoff i with shorter fundamental periods ( @xmath0 days ) and oosterhoff ii with longer fundamental periods ( @xmath1 days ) , leaving an almost empty gap at @xmath2 days .",
    "this dichotomy seems not to be present in the gc system of our neighbor galaxies .",
    "most of the galactic gcs lie inside the solar circle , and a significant number of them are located towards the galactic center .",
    "observations towards low galactic latitudes where most of the inner galactic gc lie , are highly complicated by the considerable amount of extinction produced by the gas and dust present",
    ". therefore the study of these gcs have been historically neglected , and their physical parameters have not been as accurately determined as the ones from the gcs located in other regions with low or negligible extinction @xcite .",
    "this situation is rapidly changing with the advent of new state - of - the art telescopes and instruments to observe at near - infrared wavelengths where extinction is highly diminished ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "one project that will greatly increase our knowledge of the inner galactic gcs is the vvv survey .",
    "the _ vista variables in the via lactea _ ( vvv ) survey is a currently ongoing eso public survey @xcite . it is being conducted with the 4 m vista telescope located in the cerro paranal observatory , in chile .",
    "the vista telescope , and vircam , its wide - field camera , are especially suited for near - infrared observations .",
    "the vircam camera provides observations with a field of view of @xmath4 deg@xmath5 and a spatial resolution of @xmath6 per pixel .",
    "the vvv is surveying 562 deg@xmath5 in the galactic bulge ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) and in an adjacent region of the galactic disc ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) .",
    "a total of 36 known globular clusters lie in the region surveyed @xcite , plus new gc candidates are being discovered @xcite .",
    "the survey is going to provide an atlas of the galactic inner regions in five near - infrared filters ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 ) , and the light - curves in @xmath15 for the objects found .",
    "observations in the different filters have already been taken , along with observations in @xmath15 in some different epochs , enough to produce preliminary cmds and light - curves for the stars in the surveyed inner galactic gcs . in the next sections we will focus in three of them : ngc  6441 ,",
    "terzan  10 and 2mass - gc02 .",
    "ngc  6441 is not a common metal - rich globular cluster .",
    "in addition of having a short red hb , typical of metal - rich globular clusters , it has a blue hb component , as first found by @xcite .",
    "it also presents a significant amount of variables , and among them a high number of rr  lyrae @xcite , another rare characteristic in metal - rich clusters .",
    "moreover these variables have unusually long periods , which has conducted to classify this gc , along with its twin , ngc  6388 , in a completely new oosterhoff type : the oosterhoff iii class .",
    "differential reddening across its field makes its optical cmd difficult to interpret @xcite .",
    "but the different evolutionary sequences get narrower in the near - infrared cmd ( see figure [ figcmd6441 ] ) , allowing the comparison with theoretical models . in figure [ figcmd6441 ]",
    "we have overplotted an old - age isochrone from the pgpuc library @xcite , the only one so far that provides isochrones in the vista filter system .",
    "using the values from iron content , distance , and color excess from the harris catalog @xcite , we can see that the agreement with the observational cmd is good .",
    "unfortunately , our data does not allow us to accurately define the main - sequence turn - off point , and that way better constrain the age of the cluster .",
    "there are more than 150 variables already discovered in this gc , many of which are rr  lyrae .",
    "although at near - infrared wavelengths their amplitude is reduced and the shape of the rrab light - curves is more sinusoidal ( see figure [ figcurve6441 ] ) , the quality of our data and the present sample of the light - curve ( 45 epochs for ngc  6441 ) allow us to look for more variables , and to characterize amplitudes , periods and mean magnitudes and colors . using these parameters and the rr  lyrae period - luminosity relation in the near - infrared @xcite",
    ", we will better define the extinction and distance to this gc .",
    "terzan  10 and 2mass - gc02 are recently discovered , highly - extincted , low - mass , galactic globular clusters ( see harris catalog ) .",
    "terzan  10 was discovered by @xcite , and 2mass - gc02 , even more recently , by @xcite , using data from 2mass .",
    "the high extinction in their line of sight ( @xmath16 for terzan  10 , and @xmath17 for 2mass - gc02 ) makes them extremely faint and difficult to observe in the optical bands , but not at near - infrared bands .",
    "the vvv data allow us to produce cmds for these objects from the tip of the rgb down to the sgb region ( see figure [ figcmd2 ] ) .",
    "but the analysis of the cmd here is complicated by other fact : their low number of member stars , and the high number of field stars in the regions they are located . in addition , differential reddening across the field of both gcs is clearly present in their near - infrared cmds , despite reddening being highly diminished at these wavelengths , making their cmds even more difficult to interpret .    in both cases",
    "the presence of rr  lyrae would help to better constrain these gc parameters .",
    "@xcite found five rr  lyrae candidates for 2mass - gc02 , but no candidates have been reported so far for terzan  10 .",
    "we have not been able to confirm any of the candidates found in @xcite , but we have found 5 more rr  lyrae candidates in 2mass - gc02 , and for the first time , we have found 5 rr  lyrae candidates in terzan  10 ( see figure [ figlc2 ] ) .",
    "our selection of rr  lyrae candidates was done according to shape of the light - curve , period , and position in the cmd ( see figures [ figcmd2 ] and [ figlc2 ] ) . at present , we have 33 epochs in 2mass - gc02 , which more than doubles the number of epochs in @xcite study , and 90 epochs in terzan  10 . a surprising fact in these",
    "two gcs is their oosterhoff classification .",
    "2mass - gc02 has a mean period for their rr  lyrae candidates of @xmath18 , which puts it in the oosterhoff gap , while terzan  10 has a mean period for their rr  lyrae candidates of @xmath19 , making it an oosterhoff ii candidate , which is strange for the reported metallicity of this object , @xmath20=-1.00 $ ] according to the harris catalog @xcite .",
    "these results , however , should be considered with care due to the small number of rr  lyrae candidates found so far in these two objects .",
    "we should also note that the reported metallicities from literature do not come from high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "we are currently refining our analysis to try to find more rr  lyrae variables in these gcs and provide a more complete and statistically significant sample of variables for these two gcs .",
    "the vvv survey will provide a highly improved view of the gcs located in the inner regions of the milky way .",
    "the use of near - infrared wavelengths will allow us to penetrate through the gas and dust that hide these gcs and produced clean cmds and high - quality light - curves for their variable members .",
    "analysis of those cmds and light - curves will let us infer more accurately these objects physical parameters and finally include the precise characteristics of this elusive sample in the studies of gc in our galaxy . in these proceedings , and as examples of the coming analysis , we have shown the cmds and the rr  lyrae light - curves for three gcs that lie inside the region surveyed : ngc 6441 , terzan  10 and 2mass - gc02 . a preliminary analysis from its cmd show that ngc  6441 values for its distance and extinction agree quite well with current values from literature , while the cmds from terzan  10 and 2mass - gc02 are more difficult to analyze .",
    "for these last two clusters , we have found new rr  lyrae variable candidates .",
    "their oosterhoff classification suffers from small statistics , but looks rather uncommon .",
    "terzan  10 seems to be an oosterhoff ii type but with too high an iron content to belong to the group , while 2mass - gc02 seems to be in the oosterhoff gap , where very few galactic gc lie .",
