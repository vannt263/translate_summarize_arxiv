    "kamland experiment recently detected the distortion due to oscillations in the anti - neutrino spectrum from the reactors and determined the corresponding mass - square difference , @xmath2 , to great precision @xcite . at present",
    "there is good agreement between @xmath2 and the mass - squared difference of the neutrinos , @xmath3 , determined from the analysis of solar neutrino data @xcite .",
    "however , the best - fit values of the two @xmath4s differ from each other by @xmath0 ev@xmath1 . together ,",
    "solar and kamland data impose the constraint @xmath5 ev@xmath1 @xcite",
    ". future reactor experiments , located at a distance of about 70 km from the source so that the oscillation minimum coincides with spectral maximum , are expected to improve the precision of @xmath2 even further @xcite .",
    "similarly future solar neutrino experiments , such as lens @xcite and other experiments @xcite , are expected to improve the accuracy of @xmath3 .",
    "these future experiments may indeed show that there is a non - zero difference between @xmath3 and @xmath2 , thus establishing a signal for cpt violation in the neutrino sector @xcite .    if @xmath3 and @xmath2 are indeed found to be different , a natural question to ask is : how does this cpt violation arise ? in this letter , we assume that cpt violation in neutrino sector arises due to planck scale effects .",
    "we parametrize these effects in terms of planck scale cpt violating neutrino mass terms and calculate the difference between @xmath3 and @xmath2 arising due to these terms .",
    "we assume that neutrino masses mainly arise due to grand unified theory ( gut ) dynamics via see - saw mechanism @xcite and these masses are cpt conserving .",
    "we further assume that the cpt violation arises only at planck scale and parametrize it by the effective neutrino mass term @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are flavour indices . the mass term for",
    "anti - neutrinos will have the opposite sign @xcite .",
    "since these are effective masses arising from planck scale effects , they are suppressed by @xmath9 .",
    "since these are assumed to be the masses at the low energy scale , the electroweak vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath10 gev is used to make these terms have dimension of mass . in eq .",
    "( [ cptvm ] ) the term @xmath11 is a @xmath12 matrix in flavour space whose elements are of order 1 .",
    "we assume that the planck scale interaction is `` flavour blind '' , _ i.e. _   the elements of the matrix @xmath11 are independent of @xmath13 indices . in this case , the contribution to the neutrino mass matrix is of the form : @xmath14    1 & \\!1\\ ! & 1 \\\\[-.5ex ]    1 & \\!1\\ ! & 1   \\end{array } \\right ) ,   \\label{textm}\\ ] ] where the scale @xmath15 is @xmath16 in our calculations , we take eq .",
    "( [ textm ] ) as a perturbation to the main part of the neutrino mass matrix , that is generated by gut dynamics .",
    "the theoretical framework , in which the planck scale mass terms are treated as perturbation to gut scale neutrino masses , is developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we briefly recapitulate some salient features of this framework . in the discussion below the labels @xmath7 and @xmath8 refer to flavour eigenstates and the labels @xmath17 and @xmath18 refer to mass eigenstates .",
    "the unperturbed ( @xmath19-order ) neutrino mass matrix @xmath20 is diagonalized by a unitary matrix @xmath21 to yield the matrix @xmath22 , whose eigenvalues are real and non - negative . as stated before , @xmath20 is generated by grand unified dynamics and is related to @xmath21 and @xmath22 through the relation @xmath23 we adopt the usual parameterization @xcite : @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we include all possible phases in the definition of the neutrino mixing matrix , @xmath27 the phase @xmath28 appearing in @xmath29 is the one that enters oscillation probabilities and leads to cp violation in neutrino oscillations .",
    "@xmath30 are the so called majorana phases and the matrix with this phases has the form @xmath31 .",
    "the diagonal phase matrix on the left is given by @xmath32 , which are usually absorbed into the definition of the respective charged lepton field .",
    "it is possible to rotate away the phases @xmath33 , if the mass matrix ( [ zordm ] ) _ is the complete mass matrix_. however , since we are going to add another contribution to this mass matrix , the phases @xmath33 of the zeroth order mass matrix have an impact on the complete mass matrix and thus must be retained . by the same token , the majorana phases which are usually redundant for oscillations have a dynamical role to play now .",
    "planck scale effects will add other contributions to the mass matrix .",
    "the additional term has the form given in eq .",
    "( [ textm ] ) and with its inclusion the neutrino mass matrix becomes @xmath34 it is possible that the cpt violating mass terms may be arise not at planck scale but at some scale @xmath35 below @xmath36 but well above the gut scale ( by an order of magnitude or so ) .",
    "in such a case , the perturbation parameter @xmath37 , rather than @xmath38 .",
    "we now define the hermitian matrix @xmath39 and find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "the differences of pairs eigenvalues give us the modified mass - squared differences and the eigenvectors give us the modified neutrino mixing matrix . to first order in the small parameter @xmath15",
    ", we have @xmath40 this matrix is diagonalized by a new unitary mixing matrix @xmath41 .",
    "we denote this diagonal matrix , correct to first order in @xmath15 , to be @xmath42 . using eq .",
    "( [ zordm ] ) , we can rewrite @xmath20 in the above equation in terms of the diagonal matrix @xmath22 . converting @xmath43 also into its diagonal form @xmath44 ,",
    "we can rewrite the above equation as @xmath45 from the above equation , it follows that the mixing matrix @xmath41 , correct to first order in @xmath15 , is related to zeroth order mixing matrix @xmath21 by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a hermitian matrix proportional to @xmath15 .    substituting the expression for @xmath41 from eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ tech ] ) we obtain @xmath48 .",
    "\\label{tech1}\\ ] ] because @xmath42 is diagonal , the diagonal terms of @xmath49 $ ] in the above equation are zero . therefore , to first order in @xmath15 , the mass squared differences @xmath50 get modified as : @xmath51 -m_j   \\mbox{re}[m_{jj } ] ) , \\label{dms}\\ ] ] where there is no summation over the repeated indices .",
    "the above equation shows the correction for neutrino mass - squared difference . because the planck scale corrections are assumed to be cpt violating , the correction for anti - neutrino mass - squared difference will have the opposite sign",
    "note from eq.([dms ] ) that the correction term depends crucially on the type of neutrino mass spectrum . for a hierarchial or inverse hierachial spectrum",
    "the correction is negligible .",
    "hence we consider a degenerate neutrino spectrum and take the common neutrino mass to be 2 ev , which is the upper limit from the tritium beta decay experiment @xcite .    from the definition of the matrix @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ tech ] ) , we find @xmath53 the contribution of the terms in the planck scale correction , @xmath54 , can be additive or subtractive depending on the values of the phases @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "similarly the magnitudes of @xmath57 and @xmath58 are functions of the phases @xmath33 .",
    "thus we try to find a combination of these phases which can give rise to a significant difference between neutrino and anti - neutrino mass - squared difference . in our calculations",
    ", we used @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we define the percentage correction @xmath63 to be ratio of the difference between the corrected neutrino and anti - neutrino mass - squared difference to the unperturbed mass squared difference among the first and the second mass eigenstates as ; @xmath64    in fig.(1 ) we plot our results as contours of constant @xmath63 in the @xmath65 plane , for @xmath66 .",
    "we note that the maximum difference allowed is about @xmath67 only .",
    "this is because the magnitudes of @xmath68 and @xmath69 remain relatively small in the limit @xmath66 . in figs.(2 ) we plot contours of constant @xmath63 in the @xmath70 plane with @xmath71 .",
    "when one phase is large and the other is small , there is a possibility that all the terms in @xmath68 and @xmath69 add up to give a large value for their difference and hence a large value for @xmath63 .",
    "we note that a much large change , varying from @xmath72 to @xmath73 is possible . in figs.(3 ) and ( 4 ) we plot contours of constant @xmath63 in @xmath74 plane and in @xmath75 plane . in generating these plots",
    ", we set all other phases to zero , as in the case of fig.(2 ) .",
    "the effect scales directly as the common neutrino mass , so if one takes the wmap @xcite bound on the common neutrino mass which is 0.23 ev then there is negligible effect .",
    "however if there are new flavor blind interactions between gut and planck scales , then a low common mass is compensated by a lower scale of these new interactions and we still can get appreciable effects .",
    "in fact one can even say that if the gap between @xmath3 and @xmath2 persists and future data indicate small neutrino mass , this can be an indication of new cpt violating flavor blind interactions below planck scale .     as a function of the majorana phases @xmath55 and @xmath56 ]     as a function of the phases @xmath77 and @xmath78,scaledwidth=70.0% ]     as a function of the phases @xmath77 and @xmath79,scaledwidth=70.0% ]     as a function of the phases @xmath78 and @xmath79,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "both solar and reactor data are well accounted for by invoking neutrino oscillations .",
    "fit to solar data give a large region for the neutrino mass squared difference in the two flavor parameter space .",
    "the fit to reactor data however gives a very strongly constrained anti - neutrino mass squared difference .",
    "the best fits of the two mass squared differences are appreciably different from each other .",
    "further improvement in kamland systematics and future solar neutrino data may remove this discrepancy . however",
    "if this mismatch between the best fits persists , then cpt breaking in the neutrino sector will be established .",
    "we have demonstrated that a flavour blind cpt violating neutrino masses from planck scale physics can nicely accomodate this effect .",
    "this effect is crucially dependent on the neutrino mass spectrum and gives rise to observable difference between @xmath3 and @xmath2 only for a degenerate neutrino mass spectrum with @xmath80 ev , which is the largest allowed value from tritium beta decay data .",
    "the low value of the common mass implied by the wmap bound leads to negligible difference between @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "this can however be compensated for by considering a slightly lower scale for the flavour blind cpt violating mass terms rather than the usual planck scale .",
