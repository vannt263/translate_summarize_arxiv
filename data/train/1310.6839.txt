    "the standard model , the general theory of particle physics was established more than 40 years ago .",
    "it describes our world as consisting of two kinds of elementary particles , fermions and bosons , differing by their spin , intrinsic angular momentum : fermions have half - integer , bosons have integer spins measured in units of @xmath0 , the reduced planck constant .",
    "the elementary fermions have three families , each consisting of one pair of quarks and one pair of leptons .",
    "all fermions have antiparticles of opposite charges .",
    "the leptons can propagate freely , but the quarks are confined in hadrons : they can only exist in bound states of three quarks , baryons ( like the proton and neutron ) or those of a quark and an antiquark , mesons ( like the pion ) .",
    "three antiquarks make antibaryons like the antiproton .    in the standard model",
    "the three basic particle interactions , the strong interaction holding the quarks in the nucleons and the nucleons in the atomic nucleus , the weak interaction , responsible for the decay of nuclei and of the neutron , and the well known electromagnetic interaction , are all derived from local gauge symmetries .",
    "a gauge symmetry is a freedom to define the coordinate system measuring the strength of an interaction , the best known example of which is the freedom to choose the potential zero of an electric field .",
    "a local symmetry is its modified form when the gauge is changing in space - time according to a known function .",
    "the three basic interactions are mediated by elementary bosons : the strong nuclear force by 8 gluons , the weak interactions by the three heavy weak bosons and the electromagnetism by the photon . in order to cancel uncomfortable terms from equations",
    "the theory also needs the existence of an additional scalar boson , a particle with all its quantum numbers like charges and spin zero .",
    "local gauge symmetries give correct answers to important questions except the mass of elementary particles : one has to violate them in order to introduce their masses . this spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb )",
    "was introduced in several steps to particle physics and it is now an integral part of the standard model .",
    "it is called , somewhat unjustified , also the higgs mechanism , although it is the product of several people , so it could also be called _ higgs  englert  brout",

    "mechanism @xcite .    the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism consists of adding to vacuum a potential which breaks its perfect symmetry .",
    "this is well illustrated by a mexican hat ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ssb ] ) .",
    "its axial symmetry is not violated by putting a ball on its top , however , the ball will eventually go down and break the original symmetry .",
    "ssb makes it possible to introduce masses in the theoretical equations : masses of the heavy weak bosons , w+ , w- and z0 mediating the weak interaction and also masses for the basic fermions , the quarks and leptons .",
    "the masses of the weak bosons are predicted by the standard model , whereas the fermion masses are not , those are free , adjustable parameters .",
    "note that the masses of our macroscopic world are mostly due to the energy content of the proton and the neutron and not due to the ssb mechanism .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking : the higgs potential .",
    "the axial symmetry of the potential is not violated by putting a ball on the top at zero , but it will be spontaneously broken when the ball rolls down in the valley .",
    "however , the coordinate system can always be chosen so that the ball were at point @xmath1 . ]    since almost 40 years , more and more precise new data were acquired at the particle accelerators and all seem to agree very well with the predictions of the standard model .",
    "hundreds of experiments are summarized in fig .",

    "it shows the 2012 situation of the analysis of electroweak data : all experimental data and theoretical estimates agree within the statistical boundaries .",

    "parameters of the standard model @xcite as determined by the experiment ( 2nd column ) with uncertainties ( 3rd column ) , its prediction or fit by the standard model ( 4th column ) and a bar plot showing the difference between theory and experiment divided by the experimental uncertainty .",

    "vector  boson + fusion    figure [ fig : smh - prod ] shows the various formation processes of the sm higgs boson in p - p collisions at lhc .",
    "the dominant reaction is gluon fusion and vector boson fusion is also significant .",
    "the higgs boson of the standard model is the only scalar particle : all of its quantum numbers are zero , its only property is mass . fitting experimental data predicts that the higgs mass should be around 100 gev ( between 80 and 160 gev within 95% confidence ) .",
    "all constituents of the standard model were identified and studied experimentally before the launch of the lhc , apart from the higgs boson , that is how it became the most wanted particle . as peter higgs himself told @xcite `` it was in 1972 ... that my life as a boson really began '' .",
    "those are as different from the _ official _ mathematical statistics as mechanical engineering from the lagrangian or hamiltonian formulation of theoretical mechanics . at the same time statistics",
    "is extremely important for data analysis in particle physics : every few years international workshops are organized by particle physicists working at the large hadron collider to exchange ideas on statistical methods , the last one having been in 2011 @xcite . in the appendix of that volume _ eilam gross",

    "a phystatistician is a physicist who knows his way in statistics and knows how kendall s advanced theory of statistics book looks like . _",
    "every high - energy collaboration has phystatistician experts and they all have quite different ideas how to analyze data . in order to avoid confusion ,",
    "the large lhc collaborations have statistics committees which publish home pages of recommendations how to do things .",
    "the statistics committees of both cms and atlas have several members who published text books on statistics for physicists and atlas and cms have a joint such committee as well .    as in high energy physics",
    "the experimental data are basically event counts , the basic concepts are poisson - like .",
    "the data follow the poisson distribution ( @xmath3 events in bin @xmath4 ) :   @xmath5 and the result is usually expressed in terms of the poisson likelihood : @xmath6 , where the expected number of events is @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the integral luminosity collected , @xmath9 is the cross section of source @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the efficiency ( determined by monte carlo simulation ) of source @xmath10 in bin @xmath4 .",
    "luminosity is the rate of collecting data for colliders , similar to the flux of fixed - target experiments .",
    "it is defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the circulation frequency of the colliding beams ; @xmath14 the number of particle bunches in the ring ; @xmath15 are the numbers of particles in the two kinds of bunches ; @xmath16 is the spatial overlap of the colliding bunches .",
    "the total number of collisions is characterized by the integrated luminosity : @xmath17 which is usually measured in units of inverse cross - section , at lhc in @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "the expected rate of a reaction with cross section @xmath19 at @xmath20 detection efficiency is @xmath21 .    according to the general convention in accelerator experiments a given new phenomenon",
    "is excluded if we can show it not appearing at a @xmath22 confidence level and observed if it exceeds @xmath23 above background where now , for a change , @xmath19 is the experimental uncertainty according to the best honest guess of the experimentalist .",
    "that @xmath19 uncertainty has a _ statistical component _ from the number of observed events and _ systematic _ ones from various sources , like monte carlo statistics and inputs , experimental calibration factors , detection efficiencies , etc , with the common name _ nuisance parameters_. to get a rough estimation of the total error the systematic uncertainties could be added quadratically to the statistical one : @xmath24 , but in practice we derive the final uncertainty via marginalizing ( integrating out ) @xcite the nuisance parameters @xmath25 in likelihood @xmath26 using the related probability distributions @xmath27 : @xmath28 .",
    "another important feature of high - energy data analysis is the _ blind analysis _",
    "@xcite : `` a blind analysis is a measurement which is performed without looking at the answer .",
    "blind analyses are the optimal way to reduce or eliminate experimenter s bias , the unintended biasing of a result in a particular direction . ''",
    "it came from medical research and the idea is to optimize , prove and publish your analysis technique using simulations and earlier data only before touching new data in the critical region .",
    "for instance , in spring and early summer , the 2012 cms data were blinded in the @xmath29 gev ( where @xmath30 is the simulated higgs mass ) because of the @xmath31 excess observed in 2011 .",
    "the same procedure was used again in autumn 2012 .",
    "the methods had to be fixed and approved by the collaboration before simultaneous _ unblinding _ for all analysis channels .",
    "what we usually try to observe is a resonance . for a particle with lifetime @xmath32 and decay rate @xmath33 the event rate against the invariant mass of the decay products",
    "is @xmath34 , i.e. a lorentz curve ( breit - wigner resonance ) .",
    "it shows a peak at the @xmath35 invariant mass of the decaying system with a full width at half maximum @xmath33 .",
    "we claim the discovery of a new particle if we see a resonance at the invariant mass of the particle in all expected decay channels , by all related experiments .",
    "the search involves several consecutive steps .    *",
    "compose a complete _ standard model background _ using monte carlo simulation taking into account all types of possible events normalized to their cross - sections .",
    "* compose _ higgs signals _ , simulations of all possible production and decay processes with all possible higgs - boson masses .",
    "* put all these through the _ detector simulation _ to get events analogous to the expected measured ones . *",

    "once you are happy with the simulations and the event selection , you must chose a test statistic .",
    "that could be any kind of probability variable characteristic of the given phenomenon : probabilities for having background only , signal or combinations .",
    "one of the favorite is the @xmath40 likelihood ratio of signal + background over background : @xmath41 . as you see , although our basic approach is definitely frequentist there is a certain bayesian influence as well .",

    "the various channels are different only due to the various decay processes of the accompanying z boson .",
    "lep had 4 large experiments in the 4 interaction points of the electron - positron collider , aleph , delphi , l3 and opal ( the present author was in opal ) .",
    "the structure of the large high - energy detectors are very similar , consisting of onion - like layers . a sensitive pixel detector right around the beam pipe , a tracking system of multiwire chambers or semiconductor detectors of minimal weight material following the tracks of the particles in the magnetic field of the detector , then an electromagnetic calorimeter , something heavy absorbing all electrons and photons , outside of that an even heavier hadron calorimeter , absorbing the pions , protons , neutrons , etc .",
    ", and finally , muon chambers , identifying the path of muons leaving the system .",
    "all detectors have huge magnets encompassing as much as possible of the detector parts .",
    "statistics played a rough joke at lep : one of the experiments , aleph , saw in one of the possible higgs decay channels a very significant signal corresponding to a higgs boson of a mass of 115  gev/@xmath58 , while the rest of lep have not seen anything ( fig .",
    "[ fig : adlo_2lnq ] , @xcite ) .",

    "another strange thing was that the higgs signal seen by aleph by far exceeded the expectations of the standard model . also ,",
    "the observed higgs mass was critical as it coincided with the average kinematic limit of lep : in 2000 the average collision energy of lep was about 206 gev and the observed resonance was found at 115  gev/@xmath58 , the difference is very close to the mass of the z boson , 91  gev/@xmath58 .",

    "this caused quite an excitement at lep : many physicists signed the petition to the director general of cern to extend the life of lep by another year , but that was refused : the simulated projections were not very promising for a discovery of the sm higgs boson ( the effect seen by aleph only was far too large , much higher than the prediction of the standard model ) , and the contractors for building lhc were already prepared to start .",
    "just like lep had , the large hadron collider has also 4 interaction points with a major experiment ( and possibly smaller ones ) in each .",
    "the two largest ones , atlas @xcite and cms @xcite were designed with the main aim of discovering the higgs boson , alice @xcite is specialized on heavy ion collisions and lhcb @xcite on studying rare processes involving b quarks .",
    "the author belongs to cms , so most of the results we mention are due to cms , but all will be compared to those of atlas pointing out the similarities and the ( very few and not significant ) differences .",
    "these collaborations are huge . according to the official statistics in 2012 cms had 3275 physicists ( incl .",
    "1535 students ) and 790 engineers and technicians from 179 institutions of 41 countries .",
    "the largest participant country was the usa , then italy , germany and russia .",
    "the design of lhc and its experiments started well before the actual start of lep , which means that the construction of the lhc detectors took two decades of hard work before the actual data acquisition started .",
    "its first two years lhc devoted to development rather than data taking , that really started in 2011 only .    even before lhc started the parameter fitting of the standard model pointed toward a light higgs boson , with a mass around 100  gev/@xmath58 .",
    "as lep excluded the higgs boson below 114  gev/@xmath58 the lhc experiments had to be prepared for detecting the higgs boson in the most complicated mass region , around 120  gev/@xmath58 , with several competing decay channels .",
    "it was shown very early that the best channel to observe a light higgs boson at lhc should be the decay to 2 photons because of the very high hadron background .",
    "thus both large experiments , cms and atlas designed their electromagnetic calorimeters with this in mind .",
    "the cms one consists of 75,848 pbwo@xmath60 single crystal scintillators , whereas the electromagnetic calorimeter atlas is a sampling one based on liquid argon shower detectors .    by the beginning of 2012 ,",
    "when all 2011 data were analyzed , the possible mass of the sm higgs boson was already confined to the region of 114 @xmath61 127 gev/@xmath58 by cms  @xcite ( with very similar results from atlas ) . in that region",
    "@xmath62 excesses were found at @xmath63125 gev/@xmath58 in the two main decay channels , h  @xmath64 and h  zz .",
    "after reanalyzing their data the tevatron experiments , cdf and d0 also found an excess at this mass ( after the lhc started the tevatron accelerator of fermilab was stopped ) .",
    "it seemed more and more probable that the higgs boson will be observed at lhc in 2012 , it was even decided by the cern administration to extend the data taking scheduled for 2012 before the long shutdown for accelerator development if necessary for the discovery .",
    "july 4th , the beginning of the large annual high - energy physics congress in melbourne , the spokespersons of atlas and cms gave talks from cern ( in internet connection to the whole word , including , of course , the main auditorium of the australian conference ) on higgs search .",
    "they announced that at lhc collision energies 7 and 8 tev , in two decay channels h  @xmath64 and h  zz  @xmath65 , at an invariant mass of @xmath66 gev a new boson is seen at a convincing statistical significance of @xmath53 confidence level each with properties corresponding to those of the standard model higgs boson .",
    "the fact that the new particle could decay to two photons or z bosons , confined its spin to an even integer , i.e. a boson of @xmath67 or @xmath68 . of course ,",
    "as the data analysis was optimized to find the sm higgs , it was very unlikely to find something very different .",
    "nevertheless , the two experiments emphasized that it has to be studied , whether or not its spin is really zero with a + parity ( the pseudo - scalar mesons have spin 0 with negative parity ) , and that its decay probabilities to various final states follow the predictions of the standard model .",
    "the saying that _ three people can keep something secret only if two of them are dead _ is attributed to benjamin franklin . as any result of a collaboration",
    "has to be approved by all members before it is made public , the more than 6000 participants of two large experiments knew well in advance the developing result .",
    "thus two days before the 4th july announcement , _ nature online _ already reported the result  @xcite .",
    "of course , the fact that cern invited all leading scientists of the field including those who developed spontaneous symmetry breaking for the standard model also helped people to guess that something dramatic will be announced .",
    "cern produced some figures concerning the media echo of the day : 55 media organizations were represented at the talks of 4 july , the talks were broadcasted via close to half a million internet connections ( many of them conference rooms in partner institutions , e.g. three in hungary with quite an audience in each ) , 1034 tv stations devoted 5016 news broadcasts to the event for more than a billion ( @xmath69 ) people . many - many news articles and",
    "even more blogs and talks discussed the conditions and importance of the discovery .",
    "on 31 july the two experiments submitted papers of the discovery to physics letters b , they were published 14 august @xcite .",

    "<S> the 40 years old standard model , the theory of particle physics , seems to describe all experimental data very well . </S>",
    "<S> all of its elementary particles were identified and studied apart from the higgs boson until 2012 . for decades </S>",
    "<S> many experiments were built and operated searching for it , and finally , the two main experiments of the large hadron collider at cern , cms and atlas , in 2012 observed a new particle with properties close to those predicted for the higgs boson . in this talk we describe the search process : the exclusion of the higgs boson at lep , the large electron positron collider , and the observation at lhc of a new boson with properties close to those predicted for the higgs boson of the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> we try to pay special attention on the statistical methods used . </S>"
