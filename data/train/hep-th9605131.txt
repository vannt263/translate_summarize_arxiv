    "there are two heterotic superstring theories in ten dimensions which give rise to gauge groups @xmath3 and @xmath0 respectively .",
    "the simplest description of duality for these two theories looks quite different .",
    "the @xmath3 string is believed to be dual to m - theory compactified on a finite line segment @xcite whereas the @xmath0 case is supposedly dual to a type i superstring @xcite .",
    "when the heterotic string is compactified on a circle ( and therefore any manifold with a circle as a factor ) , the two theories become equivalent in the sense that the @xmath3 string compactified on such a manifold is identical to the @xmath0 case compactified on the same manifold with different moduli @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether this holds for other compactification spaces .",
    "the case of the @xmath0 string compactified on a k3 surface was studied in @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that , although the unbroken gauge group was generically @xmath5 , by shrinking down some of the instantons one could achieve non - perturbative @xmath6 extra gauge group factors . or @xmath7 .",
    "we will count quaternionically in both cases and so will be concerned with @xmath8 supersymmetry in 6 dimensions with gauge groups containing @xmath9 . ]",
    "if all 24 instantons are shrunk down then the gauge group is generically @xmath10 .",
    "one may further enhance the gauge group by allowing these point - like instantons to coalesce .",
    "when @xmath11 instantons coalesce at a generic point in the k3 surface , the @xmath12 factor is expected to be replaced by @xmath9 .",
    "thus one may obtain @xmath13 as a gauge group in the case that all 24 instantons coalesce .",
    "the analysis of @xcite and subsequent analysis ( see , for example @xcite ) relied on this heterotic string s duality with the type i string , and @xmath14-brane technology .",
    "the @xmath3 string compactified on a k3 surface has recently been analyzed in @xcite . in this case",
    "the analysis has been done in terms of m - theory or f - theory which , for purposes of this letter , should be thought of as limits of the type ii superstring . in this case , when the instantons are shrunk down to zero size , no further gauge group appears but instead extra massless `` tensor '' multiplets appear which have no perturbative description in terms of the heterotic string .",
    "it was conjectured in @xcite that the @xmath0 heterotic string compactified on a k3 surface is the same as a particular case of the @xmath3 heterotic string compactified on another k3 surface and so the situation for the two heterotic strings compactified on a k3 surface should be analogous to that of the circle above .    if this is the case we should be able to reproduce the analysis of the @xmath0 string as in @xcite in the same language as the @xmath3 string was studied in @xcite .",
    "this is the goal of this letter .",
    "as well as providing yet another highly non - trivial test of string duality , we believe that the elliptic fibration language used to describe the heterotic string below will prove to be the more powerful ( although this may be a question of taste ) .    while completing this work we became aware of @xcite which has some overlap with the results presented here .",
    "in this section we will review the analysis we require from @xcite .",
    "this was originally cast in the form of f - theory but here we choose to rephrase things to enable us to make some slightly stronger statements .",
    "begin with the widely - believed proposition that the type iia string compactified on a k3 surface is equivalent to the ( @xmath3 or @xmath0 ) heterotic string compactified on a four - torus .",
    "now use this duality fibre - wise as proposed in @xcite to generate dual pairs in the form of a type iia string compactified on a threefold and a heterotic string compactified on k3@xmath15 of the type proposed in @xcite .",
    "the  threefold is of the form of a k3-fibration for such a scheme to work but this must be the case if the weakly - coupled heterotic string can be understood in terms of a perturbative sigma - model on the  @xcite .    since we need to handle various k3 surfaces and various fibrations ,",
    "let us fix some notation .",
    "let the type iia string be compactified on the threefold @xmath16 .",
    "we then have a fibration @xmath17 with generic k3 fibre , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is an affine coordinate on the base @xmath20 .",
    "string - string duality then replaces @xmath18 by @xmath21 for the heterotic string .",
    "now let this @xmath21 factorize into @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is constant over @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is then the fibre for another fibration @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a k3 surface such that the heterotic string is compactified on @xmath28    now let the @xmath23 of the @xmath28 acquire infinite area .",
    "this will decompactify the theory to the desired heterotic string compactified on the k3 surface , @xmath27 .",
    "if we can understand in terms of the type ii string what this large area limit of @xmath29 corresponds to , then we will have some type ii picture of the heterotic string compactified on a k3 surface .",
    "we thus regard the n=1 theory in six dimensions of a heterotic string compactified on a k3 surface as dual to a special limit of a type iia string theory compactified on some  space , @xmath16 .",
    "we need to isolate the @xmath23 degrees of freedom from the rest of the theory to allow it to go to infinite size .",
    "we thus demand that within @xmath21 , we have a heterotic string compactified on @xmath30 , where the metric factorizes and no wilson lines are wrapped around @xmath23 .",
    "the narain moduli space of a heterotic string on @xmath21 is thus restricted as @xmath31 for the discrete identifications within this space we split the even self - dual lattice @xmath32 into two self - dual lattices @xmath33 .",
    "such a factorization of the moduli space of heterotic strings on a torus is dual to a type iia string compactified on a k3 surface which has a chosen algebraic type ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the factors of the moduli space then correspond to deformation of complex structure and the deformation of complexified khler form of the k3 surface . in the case at hand",
    "we want the k3 surface to have picard lattice @xmath34 .",
    "it follows that this k3 surface must be of the form of an elliptic fibration with a unique global section .",
    "what we have shown therefore is that if we can decompactify the heterotic string to 6 dimensions as above , then @xmath16 must be a k3 fibration where the generic k3 fibre , @xmath18 , is itself an elliptic fibration .",
    "we denote this fibration @xmath35 where the generic fibre is an elliptic curve @xmath36 .",
    "the notation @xmath37 means that the affine coordinate on this @xmath20 is @xmath38 , and there are a set of such @xmath20 s parametrized by @xmath19 .",
    "the fact that this elliptic fibration has a unique section can then be used to rewrite @xmath16 itself as an elliptic fibration over some complex surface .",
    "this surface will be of the form of a fibration over @xmath24 with generic fibre @xmath37 .",
    "that is , it is the hirzebruch surface @xmath39 .",
    "it also follows that this elliptic fibration will have a section .    what exactly happens to @xmath16 as the @xmath29 in the heterotic string goes off to infinite size ?",
    "since the moduli space of the heterotic string on @xmath40 can be matched point - for - point with the moduli space of a type iia string on a k3 surface @xcite , one can show that the effect on the k3 fibre within @xmath16 is as follows .",
    "the base @xmath37 blows up to infinite size but the area of the fibre @xmath36 may be held constant .",
    "also , if we want to make the dilaton of the six dimensional theory finite , the four - dimensional heterotic string must go to a weakly - coupled limit as @xmath23 gets larger . in terms of @xmath16 , this means that the base @xmath24 of @xmath16 as a k3-fibration goes to infinite size @xcite .    at first sight",
    "it looks therefore as if @xmath16 grows in a way compatible with the elliptic fibration picture where the fibre s area remains constant but the base @xmath41 goes to infinite volume .",
    "however , we need to make sure we are capturing the right degrees of freedom to describe six - dimensional physics . to do this ,",
    "one may use m - theory type arguments along the lines of @xcite or the f - theory arguments of @xcite to see that what we should really do is to rescale the metric on @xmath16 so that it is the base @xmath41 that remains finite sized but the elliptic fibre shrinks down to nothing .",
    "the claim from @xcite which we require that we have outlined above is thus the following .",
    "any heterotic string compactified on a k3 surface is dual to a type iia string theory compactified on a @xmath16 , where @xmath16 is an elliptic fibration over @xmath41 with a section .",
    "we also only consider degrees of freedom present when the fibre is shrunk down to zero size .",
    "hirzebruch surfaces @xmath41 are classified by the number @xmath42 .",
    "this is defined such that the self - intersection of the `` exceptional '' rational curve @xmath43 is @xmath44 .",
    "we need to know how @xmath42 is determined by the heterotic string .",
    "this then determines what @xmath16 is .",
    "recall that to obtain an anomaly - free theory , the heterotic string is compactified on a k3 surface along with a principal @xmath45-bundle , @xmath46 , where @xmath45 is either @xmath3 or @xmath0 according to which heterotic string is used and @xmath47 .",
    "the homotopy class of a @xmath45-bundle over a k3 surface is defined by a map from @xmath48 into @xmath49 ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in the case of",
    "@xmath50 we have that @xmath51 and this map is essentially fixed by the @xmath52 condition . in the case of @xmath53",
    "however , we have @xmath54 and there remains an integer degree of freedom .",
    "the degree of freedom is the way that the 24 is divided between the two @xmath55 groups .",
    "we thus expect that the @xmath0 heterotic string determines a unique value for @xmath42 whereas the @xmath3 string requires further specification of how the 24 is divided between the two factors . in @xcite",
    "it was argued that this split is @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the @xmath3 string and it was conjectured that @xmath58 for the @xmath0 string .",
    "@xmath16 is an elliptic fibration over @xmath41 with @xmath38 the affine coordinate of the generic @xmath20 fibre of @xmath41 and @xmath19 the affine coordinate on the exceptional curve @xmath59 ( i.e. , the base ) .",
    "we may then write the elliptic fibration in weierstrass form @xmath60 the fact that @xmath16 is a  space constrains @xmath61 and @xmath62 as follows .",
    "the canonical class of @xmath41 is @xmath63 - ( 2+n)[f],\\ ] ] where @xmath64 $ ] is the class of @xmath59 and @xmath65 $ ] is the class of the generic @xmath20 fibre .",
    "let @xmath66 be a line bundle such that @xmath67",
    ". then @xmath61 must be a section of @xmath68 and @xmath62 must be a section of @xmath69 @xcite .    to make direct contact with the heterotic string we look for ways in which enhanced gauge groups can appear .",
    "it is generally believed that this occurs in the type iia string when ade - like singularities are acquired along a curve in @xmath16 @xcite . in the first instance",
    "we will be interested in the case that these groups are understood perturbatively from the heterotic string .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this corresponds to the generic fibre of @xmath16 as a k3-fibration containing an ade - like singularity .",
    "the appearance of ade - like singularities is well - understood in the case of elliptic surfaces and the possibilities are listed in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 case is relatively straight - forward as explained in @xcite and we quickly repeat it here as a guide to the more subtle @xmath0 case . let us force @xmath16 to have an @xmath3 singularity in every generic k3 fibre .",
    "this requires two @xmath70 fibres in kodaira s notation .",
    "this may be done by specializing ( [ eq : w ] ) to the form @xmath71 it then follows immediately from the  condition on @xmath16 above that @xmath72 is of degree 8 in @xmath19 , @xmath73 is of degree @xmath56 , @xmath74 is of degree @xmath75 and @xmath76 is of degree @xmath57 .    at the @xmath56 zeros of @xmath73 and the @xmath57 zeros of @xmath77 the singularities of the k3 fibre get worse",
    "this is interpreted in the heterotic string language as follows @xcite . to get the full @xmath3 gauge group we go to an extreme case of the bundle @xmath46 which corresponds to 24 point - like instantons .",
    "any smooth finite - sized instanton will break part of the gauge group .",
    "thus , these worse singularities are simply the location of these 24 point - like instantons .",
    "the fact that @xmath56 points worsen one of the @xmath70 fibres and @xmath57 worsen the other corresponds to the identification of @xmath42 as the way the 24 is split between the two @xmath55 factors as stated above .",
    "it is perhaps worth noting that some duality magic is already at work here .",
    "the total instanton number of 24 was predicted by the condition on @xmath16 .",
    "one may also show , using the methods of @xcite , that this condition also imposes the  condition on the space the heterotic string lives on , namely that it must be k3 .    in order that @xmath16 be a smooth manifold ,",
    "the fibration ( [ eq : e8xe8 ] ) must be blown - up ( in addition to the blow - ups of the @xmath70 fibres ) . in effect , the base @xmath41 must be blown - up at 24 points .",
    "given the results of the last section we may distinguish physically between blow - ups of the elliptic fibres and blow - ups of the base . in the four - dimensional picture of a type iia string",
    "compactified on @xmath16 , both blow - ups are deformations of the khler form on @xmath16 and are thus moduli living in four - dimensional _ vector _ multiplets .",
    "when we go to the six - dimensional picture , the fibre must be shrunk down to zero size .",
    "thus the blow - ups of the fibre are not really moduli at all .",
    "the blow - ups of the base are still moduli however . since a tensor multiplet in six dimensions contains a scalar and reduces to a vector multiplet in four dimensions ; and a vector multiplet in six dimensions contains no scalars but also reduces to a vector multiplet in four dimensions the interpretation is clear when viewing @xmath16 as an elliptic fibration :    * requiring a blow - up in the fibre indicates the appearance of a nonabelian gauge group . * requiring a blow - up of the base indicates a tensor multiplet .",
    "thus the compactification of the @xmath3 string with zero sized instantons contains generically no further enhancement of the gauge group beyond what is know perturbatively , but will contain 24 massless scalars coming from tensor multiplets which have no perturbative interpretation for the heterotic string @xcite .",
    "these extra moduli can be used to perform extremal transitions between heterotic strings of different values of @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "now we will try to do the same analysis for the @xmath0 string .",
    "firstly we ask that the theory ( with the instantons shrunk down to points ) has an unbroken perturbative gauge group of @xmath0 .",
    "this implies that the generic k3 fibre has an @xmath78 fibre itself .",
    "let us assume that this happens when @xmath79 .",
    "this means that ( see , for example , @xcite ) @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the discriminant of the elliptic fibre and @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are nonzero for @xmath79 .",
    "we also subject @xmath85 and @xmath86 to the condition above that @xmath16 be a .",
    "fixing @xmath19 , we expect to obtain a two parameter family of k3 surfaces .",
    "this is because our k3 surface has picard number @xmath87 .",
    "the problem is that , unlike the @xmath3 case , the space of solutions is not connected . to fix",
    "which component of the moduli space is suitable for the @xmath0 heterotic string , we require a further constraint .",
    "the constraint we have not yet used is the fact that the @xmath0 heterotic string is built using the even self - dual barnes ",
    "wall lattice @xmath88 , as opposed to the root lattice of @xmath0 which is _ not _ self - dual . given the duality between the picard lattice of the k3 surface and the set of winding / momenta modes of the heterotic string , this translates into the statement that the picard lattice of the k3 surface , @xmath18 , for a generic @xmath19 , is self - dual .",
    "the picard lattice of a surface as an elliptic fibration has been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the result we require is as follows .",
    "let the surface @xmath89 be an elliptic fibration and let @xmath90 be the group of global sections , which we assume to be finite .",
    "fix a section of @xmath89 and let @xmath91 be the sublattice of @xmath92 generated by components of fibres not meeting this section .",
    "we then have @xmath93 in the case of an @xmath78 fibre we know that @xmath91 is the root lattice of @xmath0 and thus has discriminant 4 .",
    "it follows that we require @xmath94 , i.e. , _",
    "@xmath18 must have two global sections as an elliptic fibration_.    the weierstrass form ( [ eq : w ] ) has generically only one global section  at @xmath95 . to force another global section",
    "we may write it in the more restricted form @xmath96 which gives a section along @xmath97 , @xmath98 . from ( [ eq : i12 ] ) we see that @xmath99 must have a zero of order 1 at @xmath79 and @xmath100 must vanish to order 2 .",
    "now when we demand that @xmath81 has a zero of order 18 we obtain a connected set of solutions as expected .",
    "the following represents a solution sufficiently generic for our purposes : @xmath101 the  condition then imposes that @xmath102 is a polynomial of degree @xmath103 in @xmath19 , @xmath104 is of degree @xmath105 , and @xmath106 is of degree @xmath107 .",
    "the discriminant on @xmath41 takes the form @xmath108    clearly from ( [ eq : discr ] ) we see the @xmath78 fibres along @xmath79 generating the @xmath0 gauge group .",
    "we also see that interesting things are going to happen at the @xmath103 zeros of @xmath109 . identifying these as the small instantons of the @xmath0 heterotic string , we see independent evidence that we require @xmath58 . in this case",
    "there will be 24 small instantons  precisely what is required for the @xmath0 gauge symmetry to appear .",
    "from now on we will assume that @xmath58 .",
    "a remarkable agreement with the results of @xcite occurs when we ask exactly what happens at the zeros of @xmath109 .",
    "consider a zero of @xmath109 of order @xmath11 in @xmath19 .",
    "this will correspond to @xmath11 point - like instantons coalescing .",
    "the generic case will be @xmath110 .",
    "the zero of the discriminant ( [ eq : discr ] ) will be of order @xmath111 in @xmath19 for any generic value of @xmath38 .",
    "the terms @xmath85 and @xmath86 are generically nonzero .",
    "thus according to @xcite , we have a curve of @xmath112 fibres . as mentioned earlier , blow - ups in such a fibre correspond to extra gauge groups appearing .",
    "that is , each small instanton is generating a new nonperturbative contribution to the gauge group . at first sight , according to @xcite , the gauge group associated to @xmath113 is @xmath114 .",
    "there is a subtlety which changes this however .    in the analysis of @xcite , where an enhanced gauge group appeared because of a degeneration of every generic k3 fibre ,",
    "care was taken to restrict to the case where the picard group of the k3 fibre was _ monodromy invariant _ as one moved around the base @xmath20 . in the case at hand",
    ", it turns out that the rational curves within the blow - up of the @xmath115 fibre are not monodromy invariant as we move around the curve within @xmath116 of fixed @xmath19 . to obtain the enhanced gauge group that really appears , we require the monodromy invariant part of the apparent local gauge group over each point .",
    "the action of the monodromy on the blown - up fibre can be translated into an action on the dynkin diagram of the simply - laced local gauge group .",
    "the required group is then the subgroup invariant under this outer automorphism .",
    "we can thus obtain non - simply - laced gauge groups in the type ii setting .",
    "this is fairly analogous to the way such groups appeared in the heterotic string @xcite .    in the case at hand",
    ", there is a @xmath117 monodromy group which acts on the @xmath115 fibre as shown in figure [ fig : sp ] ( for the case @xmath118 ) .",
    "this was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "results for finding the invariant part of lie algebras under outer automorphisms may be found in @xcite for example .",
    "we see that the gauge group which appears when @xmath11 instantons coalesce is @xmath9 in complete agreement with @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was predicted that one should also obtain hypermultiplets in a @xmath2 representation of @xmath1 when small instantons appear .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that the appearance of hypermultiplets was connected somehow to the collision of loci of bad elliptic fibres within the base @xmath41 .",
    "we will attempt to go some way to justifying these statements here .",
    "first recall the `` wrapping @xmath119-brane '' of @xcite and the way in which it applied to enhanced gauge symmetries of a type iia string on a k3 surface .",
    "when rational curves in the k3 surface shrink down to zero size , extra massless particles appear whose charges fill out the root lattice of the resulting nonabelian group .",
    "the charges are dictated by their interaction with the @xmath120 vector fields which in turn can be measured by how their mass increases as moduli within these vector supermultiplets are switched on to higgs away the enhanced gauge symmetry .",
    "the mass is given by the area which in turn is given by the khler form s value on the homology class of the rational curve .",
    "that is , the set of elements in @xmath121 of the rational curve classes around which the 2-branes wrap form the root lattice of the enhanced gauge group .    for the type iia string",
    "compactified on @xmath16 , the above picture happens along a whole curve of ade - like singularities to produce an enhanced gauge group . at points along this curve",
    ", the singularities may be worse . at these points there can be extra classes of rational curves .",
    "these need not correspond to extra vector moduli .",
    "that is , blowing - up the curve of ade - like singularities may well resolve the `` bad point '' on the curve too .",
    "however , even in this case the extra classes of rational curves can produce more massless states when the gauge group is enhanced .    from what we have said ,",
    "the homology classes of these extra curves with respect to the homology classes of the rational curves which appear when blowing up the curve of singularities should give the charges of these new states with respect to the cartan subgroup of the gauge group .",
    "that is , we expect these new homology classes to form the _ weight lattice _ of the new representation . in this way , we expect the massless hypermultiplets to appear .",
    "let us apply this approach to our @xmath1 problem .",
    "in this case we have a curve of @xmath78 fibres intersecting a curve of @xmath115 fibres transversely at one point .",
    "it is at this point of intersection that the new classes can appear .",
    "this problem was analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the result is as follows .",

    "the other @xmath128 s do not introduce any further new weights .",

    "one might try to use some kind of d - brane analysis to prove this .",
    "what we can claim however is that if the gauge symmetry exists then we must get a valid weight system for the lie algebra , and then the weight system of @xmath2 is the minimal such system that contains the rational curve classes we find .",
    "note we may apply the same techniques to the @xmath3 case as suggested in @xcite .",
    "suppose we consider the generic case of an @xmath129 gauge group .",
    "this involves a curve of @xmath130 fibres .",

    "( we suppress a lengthy algebraic calculation ) .",
    "note that a hypermultiplet contains both the representation and its complex conjugate of fields .",

    "it turns out that around these collisions there is a @xmath117 monodromy acting on the @xmath134 fibre .",
    "if @xmath137 , or the @xmath136 roots pair up in the right way to kill the monodromy , we will have an @xmath135 gauge group .",
    "otherwise we claim that the gauge group is actually @xmath138 as this is the invariant part of @xmath135 divided by a @xmath117 outer automorphism . for the generic @xmath139 case",
    "is also in agreement with the heterotic string picture .",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "] one might expect to see * 26 * s of @xmath138 appearing at these crossings but since the weights of the * 26 * are actually a subset of the roots , we have no way of deducing this with the methods introduced in this section .",
    "the excellent agreement for the analysis of the @xmath0 heterotic string between the methods shown above and those of @xcite appears to be a very strong test of string duality .",
    "we also seem to be seeing peculiar relationships between the algebraic geometry of a  and the properties of vector bundles on a k3 surface .",
    "firstly there are the properties of the enhanced gauge groups themselves , as seen above and in @xcite for example .",
    "secondly we have seen how the appearance of rational curves may be linked to massless hypermultiplets .",
    "it is worth emphasizing a difference between the behaviour of generic point - like instantons on the context of the @xmath3 string and the @xmath0 string . for @xmath3",
    ", the small instantons have the following properties @xcite    1 .",
    "there is no nonperturbative enhancement of the gauge group .",
    "2 .   there is a massless tensor multiplet for each isolated point - like instanton .    for the @xmath0 case we have @xcite    1 .",
    "there is an @xmath6 contribution to the nonperturbative part of the gauge group for each isolated point - like instanton .",
    "there are no massless tensor multiplets .",
    "when point - like instantons coalesce , the gauge group enhances further to @xmath9 .",
    "what happens when point - like instantons of the @xmath3 string coalesce ?",
    "the elliptic fibration picture shows that blow - ups in the base are required just like the isolated case , and the total number of blow - ups required is the same as the isolated case .",
    "the difference is that in this case the exceptional divisors intersect .",
    "this makes it look very analogous to the coalesced instantons in the @xmath0 string , except that blow - ups are in the base rather than the fibre .",
    "we therefore suggest the following interpretation . when @xmath11 point - like instantons of the @xmath140 string coalesce , extra massless tensor multiplets appear .",
    "the tensor multiplets associated to one point have mutual interactions however and expectation values can only be given to @xmath11 of the them simultaneously .",
    "we would like to thank v.  kaplunovsky , d.  morrison , r.  plesser and h.  tye for useful conversations .",
