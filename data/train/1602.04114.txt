    "the quasi two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) in high mobility gaas / algaas heterostructures has served to identify a new type of zero - resistance state in the 2des , one which occurs at high filling factors or low magnetic fields under microwave photo - excitation .",
    "@xcite such zero - resistance states have been fascinating in part because they could help to point out the necessary conditions for obtaining vanishing resistance in the 2des in a magnetic field .",
    "the associated oscillatory effect is also interesting from the application perspective since it could lead to new approaches for a frequency and power sensitive radiation detector in the microwave and terahertz bands , for a large number of applications.@xcite    numerous experimental @xciteand theoretical@xcite works about the radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations ( rimo ) and associated zero - resistance states have been published over the past decade . at the present",
    ", it is understood that rimos are `` @xmath4-cycle phase - shifted '' in @xmath5 , and the oscillatory minima occur in @xmath1 vs. @xmath6 plots broadly about @xmath7b_f$ ] , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the microwave frequency , @xmath10 is the effective electron mass in gaas and @xmath11  .",
    "the theoretically proposed physical mechanisms for rimos include the displacement model@xcite , the nonparabolicity model@xcite , the inelastic model@xcite and the radiation - driven electron - orbit model@xcite .",
    "these different theories have suggested dissimilar behavior of some physical properties such as , for example the polarization - angle - dependence and the power - dependence of the rimos . as a result , an interesting issue concerns the sensitivity of the rimos to the polarization angle of linearly polarized microwaves .",
    "early linear microwave polarization sensitivity work carried out on l - shaped samples@xcite showed that the the frequency and the phase of rimos are insensitive to the linear polarization angle of the microwaves .",
    "later work indicated that rimos were insensitive to circularly and linearly polarized microwaves in square - shaped samples in a quasioptical measurement@xcite .",
    "more recently , a polarization - angle - dependence in the amplitude of rimos has been demonstrated@xcite .",
    "the results were roughly consistent with the predictions of the displacement model , the nonparabolicity model , and the radiation - driven electron - orbit model for @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is damping factor and @xmath14.@xcite finally , ramanayaka _ et al .",
    "_ showed that the @xmath1 varied sinusoidally vs. @xmath0 at low microwave power , following the empirical relation @xmath15 , where @xmath0 is microwave polarization angle , @xmath16 is phase shift , and the plus and minus signs corresponded to the oscillatory maxima and minima , respectively.@xcite the results suggested both a @xmath9-dependence and a @xmath6-dependence in @xmath2 , although the phase shifts did not appear to be systematically responsive to any experimental parameters .",
    "these studies indicated that the observed phase shifts required further experimental investigation .",
    "thus , we extract the frequency dependence of the phase shift in the @xmath1 vs. @xmath0 results by applying an analysis that averages over other smaller contributions , when those contributions are smaller than estimates of the experimental uncertainty .",
    "the results suggest a non - vanishing frequency dependence in the phase shift , i.e. , @xmath17 , over the frequency interval @xmath18 ghz .",
    "the experimental setup for the polarization - orientation measurements is shown in fig .",
    "linearly polarized microwaves are generated by an antenna inside a rotatable microwave launcher , and they are transmitted via a cylindrical waveguide to the sample .",
    "the samples consist of 400-@xmath19-wide hall bar with alloyed gold - germanium contacts fabricated from gaas / algaas heterojunctions with a 2des with carrier density @xmath20 and mobility @xmath21 .",
    "the samples are immersed in pumped liquid helium to maintain a temperature of 1.5 k during the measurements .",
    "standard four - terminal lock - in techniques are utilized to measure the diagonal resistance @xmath1 .",
    "finally , the polarization angle @xmath0 is defined as the angle between the microwave electric field @xmath22 and the hall bar axis .",
    "thus , in experiment , the gradual increase of @xmath0 from @xmath23 to @xmath24 is achieved by rotating the microwave launcher .    at the outset to the experiment",
    ", a power detector is connected to a power meter and placed at the end of cylindrical waveguide , see fig .",
    "1(c ) inset .",
    "this power detector is sensitive to the radiation field along its preferred axis .",
    "the orientation of this detector is fixed parallel to the antenna , setting @xmath25 .",
    "then , the antenna is turned from @xmath23 to @xmath24 at @xmath26 increment for a number of different frequencies , @xmath9 , from @xmath27 ghz to @xmath28 ghz , to characterize the linear polarization angle of the microwaves at the bottom of the waveguide sample holder .",
    "1(c ) shows the normalized detected power as a function of @xmath0 at @xmath29 ghz .",
    "as expected for linearly polarized microwaves , the detected power varies sinusoidally with @xmath0 , and this sinusoidal curve can be described by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the detected power , @xmath32 is the dark response without microwaves , and @xmath33 is the amplitude of cosine square function . the cosine square function has been used here because the microwave power is proportional to the square of the microwave electric field .",
    "such data fits to this sinusoidal function were used to extract a phase shift , @xmath16 , in the absence of a sample to characterize the polarization angle in the measurement setup .",
    "1(c ) demonstrates good fit between detector response and the sinusoidal function , as the fit indicates that @xmath34 at @xmath35 ghz .",
    "this same method was used to extract @xmath16 at a number of frequencies .",

    "the @xmath16 extracted by fitting the data to @xmath74 are also displayed in fig .",
    "3 ( c)-(h ) . as for the data of fig .  2",
    ", we compare the @xmath16 of opposite contact pairs at the extrema of rimos in the range of @xmath86 . at @xmath66 , @xmath93 , and at @xmath67 , @xmath94 , which yields @xmath95 , still much smaller than the measurement uncertainty .",
    "for @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( fig .",
    "3(e)-(h ) ) , the @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively , which are also within the estimated measurement uncertainty of @xmath40 .",
    "similar results to those shown fig .  2 and fig .",
    "3 for @xmath52 ghz were observed at other microwave frequencies .",
    "that is , each @xmath98 at these @xmath9 were smaller than the measurement uncertainty . as a consequence",
    ", we make the assumption that the @xmath16 values obtained from the two opposite contact pairs at given @xmath6 in this sample are practically indistinguishable .",
    "thus , we average the @xmath99 and @xmath100 obtained from the opposite contact pairs of the hall bar to reduce the measurement error in the extracted @xmath16 , and assume that this average @xmath16 is more representative of the corresponding sample area ( see fig .",
    "table 1 provides a summary of the @xmath101 obtained after averaging over opposite contact pairs . here ,",
    "@xmath102 and @xmath103 are the @xmath2 s for positive and negative magnetic fields , respectively .",
    "[ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the sake of extracting the frequency dependence in @xmath2 , we evaluate also @xmath73 , which is the average of @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "for example , @xmath106 , etc .",
    "the @xmath107 at the various extrema are shown in fig .  4 as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "4 shows that the differences between any two of @xmath107 are less than @xmath78 at each @xmath9 .",
    "further , the points appeared clustered at each @xmath9 , and the point - clusters show a systematic variation with @xmath9 .",
    "these results indicate a frequency dependence in the phase shift @xmath2 even when a worst case scenario is applied for averaging over other smaller contributions to the phase shift .",
    "from the results presented above , we suggest the following : ( a ) at low @xmath31 , opposing contact pairs on a hall bar present the same value for a given extremum , a given magnetic field direction , and a given @xmath9 , for @xmath16 that is extracted from the fit of @xmath15 , within measurement uncertainty .",
    "( b ) at a given @xmath9 , the @xmath73 for all the considered extrema exhibit similar values , see fig .",
    "4 . however ,",
    "these values show a systematic dependence upon @xmath9 .",
    "note that point ( a ) is expected since the two edges of the hall bar are parallel to each other and their orientation with respect to the microwave polarization is the same . since the gaas / algaas heterojunctions represent an extraordinarily clean system with mean - free paths approaching the mm- or sample size - scale , it is difficult to develop a scenario where the two edges of the homogeneous specimen would not exhibit the same linear polarization response . in this context",
    "it might be interesting to introduce non - parallel edges to see if that feature in the specimen introduces a phase shift in the response observed on the two edges .",
    "this will be a topic of future experiments .",
    "point ( b ) suggests that the magnitude of @xmath6 does not produce profoundly distinguishable differences on representative @xmath16 at the extrema of rimos in the specimen .",
    "the difference in this aspect between present and previous experimental work could be attributed to differences in sample quality and defect configuration within the specimen . from the theoretical perspective , lei  _ _ et  al.__@xcite   have simulated sinusoidal responses of @xmath1 as a function of polarization angle @xmath0 using the balance - equation formulation of their photon - assisted magnetotransport model .",
    "the results have indicated that the phase shift in the @xmath1 vs. @xmath0 response is dependent upon @xmath6 or extremum , and @xmath9 .",
    "further , they suggested that @xmath108 , @xmath109 , etc .  in an isotropic system , which is not observed here .",
    "however , it should be noted that real samples possibly include additional complexity , such as asymmetry , that was not considered in their theory.@xcite    finally , although the cause of observed frequency - dependent @xmath16 is not yet fully understood experimentally , and theory has not considered this possibility in our context , we draw a comparison with faraday rotation in quantum hall systems . in faraday rotation , the polarization - plane of the transmitted linearly polarized radiation in the presence of magnetic field becomes a rotated by an angle , @xmath110 , which is called the faraday angle .",
    "generally , faraday rotation , @xmath110 , is a function of radiation frequency per the drude - lorentz model@xcite .",
    "the phase shifts @xmath2 reported here appear , however , in a @xmath111 response , the magnetoresistance , observed under @xmath112-excitation .",
    "one might qualitatively understand the observed @xmath2 by suggesting that the 2des rotates the polarization of the @xmath112 excitation , and the @xmath111 response then follows polarization of the rotated @xmath112 excitation .",
    "in such a situation , @xmath2 could be a manifestation of @xmath113 .",
    "further theory is needed , however , to provide more understanding of this possibility .",
    "the phase shifts observed in the polarization - angle - dependence of microwave - induced magnetoresistance oscillations have been processed using an analysis which emphasized averaging over the smaller contributions , when the smaller contributions were smaller than estimates of the experimental uncertainty .",
    "the analysis was carried out in order to extract a possible microwave frequency contribution to the phase shift , @xmath3 , observed in the @xmath1 vs. @xmath0 response of the microwave radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations .",
    "the analysis demonstrates a non - vanishing frequency dependent contribution to the phase shift over the frequency interval @xmath18 ghz .",
