    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most promising extensions to the standard model ( sm ) . since low - energy susy",
    "is broken there exist numerous free parameters that make it a highly challenging task to reveal the underlying model at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and at the international linear collider ( ilc ) .",
    "it is planned that the ilc starts with an energy of @xmath1  gev , which will be upgraded to about 1  tev @xcite .",
    "however , already at the first energy stage , the ilc could reach higher energy up to about @xmath5  gev at cost of luminosity . in this study",
    "we sketch a possible motivation to apply this higher energy option .",
    "particularly interesting are case studies which apply interplay of search strategies at the lhc and the ilc  @xcite .",
    "we extend in this paper the methods for combined lhc / ilc analyses developed in  @xcite .",
    "an interesting possibility for the determination of the supersymmetric model is to study the gaugino / higgsino particles , which are expected to be among the lightest supersymmetric particles . in this paper",
    "we consider two basic supersymmetric models : the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) .",
    "the mssm contains four neutralinos @xmath6 , the mass eigenstates of the photino , zino and neutral higgsinos , and two charginos @xmath7 , being mixtures of wino and charged higgsino .",
    "the neutralino / chargino sector depends at tree level on four parameters : the u(1 ) and su(2 ) gaugino masses @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the higgsino mass parameter @xmath10 , and the ratio @xmath11 of the vacuum expectation values of the higgs fields . for the determination of these parameters , straightforward strategies",
    "@xcite have been worked out even if only the light neutralinos and charginos @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are kinematically accessible at the first stage of the ilc  @xcite .",
    "the nmssm @xcite is the simplest extension of the mssm by an additional higgs singlet field .",
    "new parameters in the neutralino sector are the vacuum expectation value @xmath15 of the singlet field and the trilinear couplings @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the superpotential , where the product @xmath18 replaces the @xmath10-parameter of the mssm @xcite .",
    "the additional fifth neutralino may significantly change the phenomenology of the neutralino sector . in scenarios where the lightest supersymmetric particle is a nearly pure singlino",
    ", the existence of displaced vertices leads to a particularly interesting experimental signature @xcite . in case",
    "only a part of the particle spectrum is kinematically accessible the distinction between the models may become challenging .",
    "it has already been worked out that there exist mssm and nmssm scenarios with the same mass spectra of the light neutralinos but different neutralino mixing . in this case beam polarization",
    "is crucial for distinguishing the two models @xcite .",
    "we present a scenario where all kinematically accessible neutralinos and charginos have similar masses and almost identical cross sections , within experimental errors , in mssm and nmssm .",
    "although the second lightest neutralino in the nmssm has a significant singlino component , the models can not be distinguished by the experimental results at the lhc or at the ilc@xmath19 with @xmath1 gev alone if only measurements of masses , cross sections and gaugino branching ratios are considered .",
    "precision measurements of the neutralino branching ratio into the lightest higgs particle and of the mass difference between the lightest and next - to - lightest susy particle @xcite may give first evidence for the susy model but are difficult to realize in our case . therefore",
    "the identification of the underlying model requires precision measurements of the heavier neutralinos by combined analyses of lhc and ilc as described in the following section .",
    "we study an nmssm scenario with the parameters @xmath20 the hierarchy @xmath21 of the u(1 ) and su(2 ) mass parameters leads to very similar masses of the lightest neutralino @xmath22 , which is assumed to be the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , and of the light chargino @xmath23 .",
    "this mass degeneration is also typical for minimal anomaly mediated susy breaking ( mamsb ) scenarios .",
    "rather small mass differences may be resolved experimentally by applying the isr method @xcite at the linear collider @xcite as well as at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the nmssm parameters lead to the following gaugino / higgsino masses and eigenstates : @xmath24 where the neutralino eigenstates are given in the basis @xmath25 . as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ ez - chi02-nm ] ) and ( [ ez - chi03-nm ] ) , the particles @xmath13 and @xmath26 have a rather strong singlino admixture .",
    "the higgs sector does not allow the identification of the nmssm @xcite if scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons with dominant singlet character escape detection .",
    "a scan with nmhdecay @xcite in our scenario over the remaining parameters in the higgs sector , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , results in parameter points which survive the theoretical and experimental constraints in the region @xmath29  gev and @xmath30 . for",
    "@xmath31  gev the second lightest scalar ( @xmath32 ) and the lightest pseudoscalar ( @xmath33 ) higgs particle have very pure singlet character and are heavier than the mass difference @xmath34 , hence the decays of the neutralinos @xmath13 and @xmath26 , which will be discussed in the following , are not affected by @xmath32 and @xmath33 , see figure  [ higgs - sector ] ( left panel ) . for our specific case study",
    "we choose @xmath35  gev and @xmath36  gev , which leads to @xmath37  gev , @xmath38  gev and @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41  tev .",
    "furthermore the lightest scalar higgs @xmath42 has mssm - like character in this parameter range with a mass of about 124  gev .",
    "also the branching ratio of @xmath13 in the lightest higgs particle differs only by a factor two in both scenarios . in case",
    "that a precise measurement of this br is possible first hints for the inconsistency of the model could be derived at the ilc .      in our nmssm scenario in the gaugino / higgsino sector",
    "only the light chargino @xmath43 and the light neutralinos @xmath22 and @xmath44 are accessible at the ilc@xmath19 .",
    "we calculate the masses of the charginos and neutralinos and the cross sections for the pair production of the light chargino @xmath45 and for the associated production of the light neutralinos @xmath46 with polarized and unpolarized beams .",
    "the masses and cross sections in different beam polarization configurations provide the experimental input for deriving the supersymmetric parameters within the mssm using standard methods @xcite :    * we assume an uncertainty of @xmath47 for the masses @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 . the errors of the cross sections , @xmath54 and @xmath46 , are composed of the error due to the mass uncertainties , polarization uncertainty and one standard deviation statistical error based on @xmath55  fb@xmath56 for each polarization configuration .",
    "deviations in the cross sections due to the polarization uncertainty of @xmath57 are generally small ; it is expected that the error could even be reduced up to @xmath58@xmath59 , @xcite .",
    "the assumed uncertainties in total are listed in table  [ lc - input ] .",

    "such a hierarchy could be naturally embedded in mamsb scenarios . for even larger @xmath67",
    "the heavier neutralinos @xmath68 become crucial for @xmath8 determination see @xcite .",
    "since the heavier neutralino and chargino states are not produced , some of the parameters in our case @xmath10 and @xmath11 can only be determined with a considerable uncertainty .",
    "+ within these limits an explicit mssm scenario , @xmath69 leads to the same ( lighter ) neutralino / chargino masses and cross sections : @xmath70 where the neutralino mixing states are given in the basis @xmath71 .",
    "comparing eqs .",
    "( [ ez - chi01-ms])([ez - chi03-ms ] ) with eqs .",
    "( [ ez - chi01-nm])([ez - chi03-nm ] ) shows that the three lightest neutralino masses are the same within the experimental uncertainties .",
    "we checked that also the accessible cross sections at the ilc@xmath19 and the br s of @xmath13 are consistent .",
    "* after the determination of the fundamental mssm parameters we calculate the heavy chargino and neutralino masses and expected mixing characters .",
    "for the masses we obtain : @xmath72    the predicted gaugino admixture of @xmath26 , @xmath73 within the allowed parameter ranges , eqs.([mssmresult1])([mssmresult4 ] ) , are shown in figure  [ higgs - sector ] ( right panel ) .",
    "obviously , the heavy neutralino @xmath26 should be almost a pure higgsino within the mssm prediction .",
    "the predicted properties of the heavier particles can now be compared with mass measurements of such susy particles via the analysis of cascade decays at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that although we started with an nmssm scenario where @xmath13 and @xmath26 have large singlino admixtures , the mssm parameter strategy does not fail and the experimental results from the ilc@xmath19 with @xmath60  gev and @xmath61  gev lead to a consistent parameter determination in the mssm .",
    "hence in the considered scenario the analyses at the ilc@xmath19 or lhc alone do not allow a clear discrimination between mssm and nmssm .",
    "all predictions for the heavier gaugino / higgsino masses are consistent with both models .",
    "however , the ilc@xmath19 analysis predicts an almost pure higgsino - like state for @xmath26 and a mixed gaugino - higgsino - like @xmath73 , see figure  [ higgs - sector ] ( right panel ) .",
    "this allows the identification of the underlying supersymmetric model in combined analyses at the lhc and the ilc@xmath74 .",
    "the expected large cross sections for squark and gluino production at the lhc give access to a large spectrum of coloured as well as non - coloured supersymmetric particles via the cascade decays .",
    "heavy gaugino - states appear almost only in cascade decays and there exist some true simulations how to measure the heavier gauginos in such decays at the lhc @xcite . particularly helpful for the identification of the particles involved in the cascades , e.g.  for more model - independent analyses ,",
    "are mass predictions from the ilc analysis which lead to an increase of statistical sensitivity for the lhc analysis and open the possibility of identifying even marginal signals in the squark cascades  @xcite . however , since higgsino - like charginos and neutralinos do not couple to squarks , their detection via cascade decays is not possible .    in our original nmssm scenario the neutralinos @xmath13 and",
    "@xmath26 have a large bino - admixture and therefore appear in the squark decay cascades .",
    "the dominant decay mode of @xmath13 has a branching ratio @xmath75 , while for the @xmath26 decays @xmath76 is largest .",
    "since the heavier neutralinos , @xmath73 , @xmath77 , are mainly higgsino - like , no visible edges from these particles occur in the cascades .",
    "it is expected to see the edges for @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and for @xmath81 @xcite .    with a precise mass measurement of @xmath12,@xmath13 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 from the ilc@xmath19 analysis , a clear identification and separation of the edges of the two gauginos at the lhc is possible without imposing specific model assumptions .",
    "we therefore assume a precision of about 2% for the measurement of @xmath84 , in analogy to @xcite : @xmath85 the precise mass measurement of @xmath26 is compatible with the mass predictions of the ilc@xmath19 but not with the prediction of the mixing character , see e.g.  eq .",
    "( [ ez - chi03-ms ] ) . however , it is not clear that the measured particle at the lhc is indeed the @xmath26 . often in the constrained mssm ,",
    "as e.g. also in our mssm comparison scenario , the second heaviest neutralino @xmath26 is nearly a pure higgsino and does not couple in the cascade decays . in those cases ,",
    "the heaviest neutralino @xmath73 has frequently a sufficiently large gaugino component and could be measured in cascades , as shown in @xcite .",
    "therefore is is inevitable to discuss the following cases of possible particle _ identification _ of the measured gaugino mass @xmath84 at the lhc :    * interpretation of the measured particle as @xmath26 and feeding it back in the ilc analysis leads to improved parameter determination and mass prediction for @xmath86 , @xmath87 . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : mchi3lhc ] ) for the ilc@xmath19 analysis leads in our case , after rechecking with the allowed cross sections of @xmath88 and @xmath89 production , to rather precise mass predictions : @xmath90\\mbox { gev \\quad and \\quad } m_{\\tilde{\\chi}^{\\pm}_2}=[360 , 380]\\mbox { gev}. \\label{eq : heavymass - pred}\\ ] ] * interpretation of the measured particle as @xmath73 and feeding it back in the parameter determination of the ilc analysis leads to inconsistency with the measured cross sections of @xmath88 and @xmath89 production .",
    "the combined lhc@xmath91ilc@xmath19 analysis leads therefore to a correct interpretation of the measured particles in the cascades .",
    "however , a neutralino @xmath26 with sufficiently large gaugino admixture to couple to squarks is incompatible with the allowed parameter ranges of eqs .",
    "( [ mssmresult1])([mssmresult4 ] ) in the mssm , cf .",
    "figure  [ higgs - sector ] ( right panel ) .",
    "we point out that a measurement of the neutralino masses @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath84 which could take place at the lhc alone is not sufficient to distinguish the susy models since rather similar mass spectra could exist , cf .",
    "( [ ez - chi01-nm])([ez - chi03-nm ] ) with eqs .",
    "( [ ez - chi01-ms])([ez - chi03-ms ] ) .",
    "therefore the cross sections in different beam polarization configurations at the ilc have to be included in the analysis . the combined results from the lhc and the ilc@xmath19 analyses and the rather precise predictions for the missing chargino / neutralino masses , eq .",
    "( [ eq : heavymass - pred ] ) , constitute a serious motivation to apply immediately the low - luminosity but higher - energy option ilc@xmath74 , which finally leads to the right identification of the underlying model .",
    "the expected polarized and unpolarized cross sections , including the statistical error on the basis of one third of the luminosity of the ilc@xmath19 , are given in table  [ tab_heavy ] .",
    "the neutralino @xmath26 as well as the higgsino - like heavy neutralino @xmath73 and the chargino @xmath92 are now accessible at the ilc@xmath93 .",
    "already the high rates for @xmath94 production give last true evidence for the obvious contraction with an corresponding mssm scenario . together with the mass measurements of @xmath95  gev and @xmath96  gev , which are also in strong disagreement with the mass prediction , eq .  ( [ eq : heavymass - pred ] ) , one has sufficient observables which point to the nmssm",
    ". extensions of existing fit programs for the nmssm may lead to an exact resolution of the underlying parameters  @xcite .",
    "we have presented a scenario in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) that could not be distinguished from the mssm at either the lhc or at the first stage of the international linear collider with @xmath97 gev .",
    "it turns out that the most promising sector for distinction is the gaugino / higgsino sector .",
    "although a light neutralino has a significant singlet component in the nmssm , the masses of the accessible light neutralinos and charginos , as well as the production cross sections , lead to identical values in the two models within experimental errors .",
    "the comparison of the predicted masses and mixing character of the heavier neutralinos and charginos with the measured masses in combined analyses with the lhc followed by a precise measurement of the cross sections at the ilc at @xmath98 gev leads to a clear identification of the supersymmetric model .",
