    "one of the main goals of quantum gravity is to provide a better understanding of the big bang or big crunch singularities in cosmology .",
    "an issue that immediately comes to mind is whether cosmological singularities represent a true beginning or end of evolution . if this is the case it would raise the question what determines the boundary conditions at the singularity .",
    "a truly unified theory should then , besides specifying the dynamics , also include a principle that specifies the universe s quantum state .",
    "an appealing proposal in this context is the quantum state given by the no boundary wave function @xcite .",
    "this describes the creation of an ensemble of universes with diverse properties .",
    "the no boundary proposal asserts that all information about a possible phase before the big bang that is in principle accessible to an observer in a given member of this ensemble is encoded in the no boundary instanton .",
    "but there is no real sense in which evolution continues through the singularity : the instanton describes the beginning of a new , disconnected universe that has a self - contained physical description .",
    "because there is no boundary in the past , the no boundary condition naturally leads to a top down approach to cosmology @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "one first specifies a number of properties ( as few as necessary , of course ) of the universe at late times , which are then used to compute conditional probabilities predicting other features .",
    "the set of a posteriori conditons essentially select the histories that contribute to the path integral for a given member of the ensemble of universes .    alternatively , it is possible that evolution continues through the singularity and that string theory itself determines the conditions at cosmological singularities .",
    "there may be some type of bounce , as envisioned by the pre - big bang @xcite and cyclic universe models @xcite , or the transition could be chaotic , in which case one presumably needs to resort again to a top down approach to explain our observed universe .",
    "even if evolution continues through the singularity the quantum state at the singularity may contain certain universal features .",
    "perhaps the correct answer will turn out to be a combination of both scenarios : cosmological singularities could represent an endpoint of evolution only in certain situations , depending on the approach to the singularity .",
    "this would raise the interesting possibility that only certain ` special ' cosmologies could be created from a pre - big bang phase .",
    "since our usual notions of space and time are likely to break down near cosmological singularities , a particularly promising approach to study this issue might be to find a dual description in terms of more fundamental variables .",
    "in string theory we do not yet have a dual description of real cosmologies , but we do have the celebrated ads / cft correspondence @xcite which provides a non - perturbative definition of string theory on asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetimes in terms of a conformal field theory ( cft ) . the dual cft description has been used to study the singularity inside black holes @xcite , which is analogous to a cosmological singularity . although some progress in this direction has been made , the fact that the singularity is hidden behind an event horizon clearly complicates the problem .",
    "this is because the cft evolution is dual to bulk evolution in schwarzschild time so the cft never directly ` sees ' the singularity",
    ".    it would be better to have examples of solutions in a low energy supergravity limit of string theory where smooth , asymptotically ads initial data evolve to a big crunch singularity . then ads / cft should provide a precise framework in which the quantum nature of cosmological singularities could be understood , at least with ads boundary conditions . in this context ,",
    "a big crunch singularity is simply any spacelike singularity which extends to infinity and reaches the boundary in finite time .    in this lecture we present examples of such solutions in the abelian truncation of gauged @xmath1 , @xmath2 supergravity in which one",
    "focuses on the @xmath3 cartan subgroup of @xmath4 .",
    "gauged @xmath5 supergravity arises as the massless sector of eleven dimensional supergravity compactified on @xmath6 .",
    "the truncation to the @xmath3 sector contains three scalar fields with @xmath0 in units of the ads radius .",
    "we begin by reviewing the class of asymptotic conditions on these fields ( and the metric components ) that are invariant under the full ads symmetry group . for each scalar",
    "we find ( in addition to the standard ` dirichlet ' boundary conditions ) there is a one parameter family of boundary conditions , labelled by @xmath7 , that preserve the full set of ads symmetries .",
    "when @xmath7 vanishes , the dual cft is the usual @xmath8 theory on a stack of m2-branes .",
    "nonzero values of the parameter @xmath7 correspond to modifying this theory by a triple trace operator . on the bulk side ,",
    "the generators of the asymptotic symmetries are finite for all @xmath7 , but acquire a contribution from the scalar fields .",
    "for @xmath9 we find there are static spherical black holes with scalar hair .",
    "these solutions are specified by a single conserved charge , namely their mass .",
    "since schwarschild - ads is a solution too for all boundary conditions , this provides an example of black hole non - uniqueness .",
    "we then show there are also static solitons .",
    "we explain that the existence of solitons indicates ads is nonlinearly unstable for these generalized ads invariant boundary conditions .",
    "a particular manifestation of this is that for all nonzero @xmath7 , there are bulk solutions where smooth , finite mass initial data evolve to a big crunch .",
    "we conclude this lecture with a preliminary discussion of the dual field theory description of the formation of a big crunch .    all this work was done in collaboration with g. horowitz and k. maeda , and the reader",
    "is referred to the original papers for more details @xcite .",
    "we first consider gravity in @xmath10 dimensions coupled to a single scalar field with a potential @xmath11 that has a negative maximum at @xmath12 .",
    "this theory admits a pure @xmath13 solution , with metric [ adsmetric ] ds^2_0 =    radius is given by l^2= - since we are assuming that the scalar mass @xmath14 is less than zero , solutions to the linearized wave equation @xmath15 with harmonic time dependence @xmath16 all fall off asymptotically like [ genfall ] = r^_- + r^_+ with [ fallofftest ] _",

    "the second solution asymptotically behaves like @xmath19 .",
    "we are interested in this lecture in nonlinear perturbations of ( [ adsmetric ] ) where the scalar asymptotically behaves as ( [ genfall ] ) .",
    "asymptotically anti - de sitter spacetimes are defined by a set of boundary conditions at spacelike infinity which satisfy the requirements set out in @xcite .",
    "the standard set of boundary conditions on the metric components @xcite that are left invariant under @xmath20 are [ usual ] g_rr = l^2 r^2 -l^4 r^4 + o(1/r^d+1 ) &   g_tt= -r^2 l^2 -1 + o(1/r^d-3 ) + g_tr = o(1/r^d )   & g_ra = o(1/r^d )    + g_at = o(1/r^d-3 ) &  g_ab=|g_ab+o(1/r^d-3 ) these boundary conditions go together with ( and indeed require ) the standard ` dirichlet ' boundary conditions on the scalar field , which amount to taking @xmath21 in ( [ genfall ] ) .",
    "it is well known that with these boundary conditions , a scalar field with negative mass squared does not cause an instability in anti de sitter space . for boundary conditions of this form",
    "there is a positive energy theorem @xcite which ensures that the total energy can not be negative as long as the scalar does not violate the bf bound .",
    "recall that the energy , and more generally , conserved charges associated with asymptotic symmetries @xmath22 can be defined as follows @xcite .",
    "one starts with the hamiltonian ( we have set @xmath23 ) h [ ] = d^dx ^h_= d^dx(^h_(x)+^i h_i(x ) ) where @xmath24 are the usual hamiltonian and momentum constraints , _ & = & ( ^ij_ij- + ) + , + h_i & = & -2d_j ( ) + pd_iand @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the momenta conjugate to @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "one then adds surface terms so that @xmath29 has well defined functional derivatives , and one subtracts the analogous expression for the @xmath13 background .",

    "notice that the boundary conditions on some of the metric components are relaxed compared to the standard set . for @xmath39 we recover boundary conditions on the scalar corresponding to @xmath40 in ( [ genfall ] ) , which have been considered previously in the context of ads / cft @xcite .",
    "remarkably , however , the full ads symmetry group is preserved for all values of @xmath7 . in particular , it is easy to see that rescaling @xmath41 leaves @xmath7 unchanged . since @xmath42 depends on the particular solution and can vanish , each of these boundary conditions admits @xmath13 as a solution .",
    "for these more general boundary conditions , the usual energy ( [ gravcharge ] ) diverges as @xmath43 .",
    "however , the purely gravitational surface term ( [ gravcharge ] ) no longer equals the conserved charge associated with the asymptotic symmetry @xmath44 .",
    "instead , by repeating the above procedure , one finds the conserved charges acquire an additional contribution from the scalar field .",
    "the conserved charges now read @xcite [ totcharge ] q[]=q_g[]+1",
    "2d ^ . for all finite @xmath7 ( including @xmath39 ! )",
    "the scalar and gravitational terms separately diverge .",

    "by contrast , the scalar charges @xmath46 vanish for the standard @xmath21 scalar boundary conditions .",
    "for the case @xmath39 the scalar surface term is equivalent to the surface term @xmath47 introduced by klebanov and witten in @xmath2 supergravity , to regularize the action of the @xmath48 modes of the @xmath0 scalar @xcite .    for spherical solutions that are asymptotically of the form ( [ falloffphi])-([falloffg ] ) , it is easy to compute the total mass @xmath49 .",
    "one obtains [ totmassspher ] m = q[_t]= ( s^d-1 ) ( d-1 2 m_0 - 2f m^2 ^d/_-",
    "d ) , where @xmath50 is the coefficient of the @xmath51 correction to the @xmath52 component of the ads metric .",
    "we emphasize again that in the theory defined by @xmath39 boundary conditions , which is often used in ads / cft , the backreaction of the scalar relaxes the asymptotic falloff of some metric components , while preserving the asymptotic ads symmetry group .",
    "although there is no residual finite scalar contribution to the total mass @xmath49 in this case , it is only the variation of the sum of both charges that is well defined .",
    "finally we briefly mention the case of a scalar saturating the bf bound , which generically behaves as @xmath19 near the boundary .",
    "one finds there is again a one - parameter family of boundary conditions , involving the logarithmic branch , that preserves the ads symmetries @xcite . for all finite values of the parameter @xmath7 that labels the different asymptotic conditions , the gravitational and scalar surface terms are logarithmically divergent .",
    "the divergences again cancel out , however , rendering the total charges ( [ totcharge ] ) finite .",
    "we now consider the low energy limit of string theory with @xmath53 boundary conditions .",
    "the massless sector of the compactification of @xmath54 supergravity on @xmath6 is @xmath55 gauged supergravity in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "the bosonic part of this theory involves the graviton , 28 gauge bosons in the adjoint of @xmath4 , 70 real scalars , and it admits @xmath56 as a vacuum solution .",
    "it is possible to consistently truncate this theory to its abelian @xmath3 sector @xcite .",
    "the resulting action is given by [ 4-action ] s = d^4x(r -_i=1 ^ 3 [ ( _ i)^2 -2(_i ) ] ) + ... where the dots refer to gauge field terms that will be set to zero in this paper .",
    "here we have chosen the gauge coupling so that the ads radius is equal to one .",
    "notice that the potential is unbounded from below , and the scalars have mass m^2_i = -2  .",
    "the bf bound in four dimensions is @xmath57 .",

    "we now turn to a more detailed analysis of this theory , with boundary conditions specified by ( [ 4-scalar])-([4-grr ] ) . to simplify the analysis we concentrate on solutions with only one nontrivial scalar @xmath28 .",
    "first we look for static , spherically symmetric ads black hole solutions with scalar hair .",
    "the original no hair theorem of bekenstein @xcite proves there are no asymptotically flat black hole solutions with scalar hair for minimally coupled scalar fields with convex potentials .",
    "this result was generalized to the case of minimally coupled scalar fields with arbitrary positive potentials in @xcite .",
    "later it was shown @xcite there are no hairy , asymptotically ads black holes where the scalar field asymptotically tends to the true minimum of the potential . in @xcite , however , an example was given of a hairy black hole where the scalar field asymptotically goes to a negative maximum of the potential .",
    "it is , however , not clear this solution can be regarded as being asymptotically ads in a meaningful way , because its mass diverges .",
    "more recently , however , a one - parameter family of ads black holes with scalar hair was found in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "asymptotically the scalar field again tends to a negative maximum , but the potential satisfies the bf bound and the solutions belong to the class ( [ falloffphi])-([falloffg ] ) in three dimensions .",
    "this raises the question if ads black holes with scalar hair also exist in supergravity in four dimensions .",
    "in particular , it is possible that bekenstein s no hair theorem applies to supergravity with some ads invariant boundary conditions , but not with others .",
    "writing the metric as ds_4 ^ 2=-h(r)e^-2(r)dt^2+h^-1(r)dr^2+r^2d_2 ^ 2 the field equations read [ bhhairy14d ] h_,rr+(+_,r^2h+h_,r ) _ , r = v _ , [ bhhairy24d ] 1-h - rh_,r-_,r^2h = r^2v ( ) [ bhhairy34d ] _ , r = - r _ , r^2 2    ( 0,0 ) ( 56,254)@xmath60 ( 412,23)@xmath61    regularity at the event horizon @xmath62 requires [ horcon4d ] (r_e ) = r_ev_,1-r_e^2v asymptotic ads invariance requires @xmath28 asymptotically decays as [ hair4d ] ( r)=+ , where @xmath7 is a given constant that is determined by the choice of boundary conditions .",

    "the stability and thermodynamic properties of these hairy black hole solutions is currently under investigation @xcite .",
    "the existence of hairy black holes suggests there should also be regular static , spherically symmetric solitons that obey the same boundary conditions ( [ 4-scalar])-([4-grr ] ) .",
    "soliton solutions can similarly be found by numerically solving eqs ( [ bhhairy14d]-[bhhairy34d ] ) .",

    "most importantly , the existence of soliton solutions for a large class of ads invariant boundary conditions implies supergravity with these boundary conditions does not admit a positive mass theorem @xcite .",
    "this can be seen as follows . for the spherical solitons the constraint equation ( [ bhhairy24d ] )",
    "can be integrated , which yields a formal expression for the gravitational surface term ( [ gravcharge ] ) [ gensoln ] q_g [ _ t ] = 2_r_0^r e^-12 _ r^r dr  r^2 r^2 dr",

    "in fact , we see that @xmath107 and hence ( [ charge4d ] ) implies that the total mass is zero !",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation of the instanton as the solution @xmath56 decays into .",
    "the quantum decay rate is determined in a semiclassical approximation by the euclidean action of instanton .",
    "the action is given by i = - k + 1 6 where the first surface term is the usual gibbons - hawking term , and the second is the surface term required so that the hamiltonian constructed from this action ( after subtracting the background ) agrees with ( [ charge4d ] ) .",

    "it follows that the field must evolve to a spacelike singularity @xcite .",

    "hence there is simply not enough mass to form a black hole , which encloses the singular region .",

    "the same is likely to be true here . ] .",
    "boundary conditions that admit a soliton solution , therefore , also admit solutions where finite mass configurations produce a big crunch .    a particular example of such a solution where the evolution is known explicitly is provided by the euclidean instanton .",
    "the evolution of initial data defined by slicing the instanton across the three sphere is simply obtained by analytic continuation .",

    "outside the lightcone , the solution is given by ( [ inst ] ) with @xmath115 replaced by three dimensional de sitter space .",

    "inside the lightcone , the @xmath116 symmetry ensures that the solution evolves like an open frw universe , [ ametric ] ds^2 = -dt^2 + a^2(t ) d_3 where @xmath117 is the metric on the three dimensional unit hyperboloid .",
    "the field equations are [ fieldeq ] aa= 13[v ( ) - ^2 ] [ phieq ] + 3 aa + v _ , = 0 and the constraint equation is [ constraint ] a^2 - a^23= 1  , where @xmath118 .",
    "on the light cone , @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( since @xmath121 at the origin in the instanton ) . under evolution",
    "@xmath28 rolls down the negative potential , so the right hand side of ( [ fieldeq ] ) decreases .",
    "this ensures that @xmath122 vanishes in finite time producing a big crunch singularity .",
    "for the purpose of understanding cosmological singularities in string theory , one can forget the origin of this solution as the analytic continuation of an instanton .",
    "we have simply found an explicit example of asymptotically ads initial data which evolves to a big crunch .",
    "we close this section with some comments on possible generalizations . in section 2",
    "we have shown that one can generalize the boundary conditions while preserving the asymptotic ads symmetries whenever one has a scalar field with @xmath123 which decouples from the rest of the matter .",
    "in particular , this includes @xmath1 supergravity in five dimensions , which involves a scalar field saturating the bf bound . in all cases one can construct similar solutions where a big crunch is produced from smooth finite mass initial data @xcite .",
    "the simplest solutions of this kind that we have presented here are constructed from time symmetric initial data , so they have a big bang singularity in the past as well .",
    "it would be interesting to construct solutions with only one singularity , in the future or the past .",
    "having shown that the bulk theory admits solutions which evolve to a big crunch , we now turn to the dual cft description of this theory .",
    "the dual to string theory on @xmath124 can be obtained by starting with the field theory on a stack of @xmath125 d2-branes .",
    "this is a @xmath126 gauge theory with seven adjoint scalars @xmath127 .",
    "one then takes the infrared ( strongly coupled ) limit to obtain the cft . in the process",
    ", one obtains an @xmath4 symmetry . in the abelian case , @xmath128",
    ", this can be understood by dualizing the three dimensional gauge field to obtain another scalar .",
    "but in general , it is not well understood .",
    "this theory has dimension one operators @xmath129 where @xmath130 is symmetric and traceless @xcite . s and the theory has @xmath4 symmetry , there are other operators involving the gauge field which complete the @xmath4 representation .",
    "] one of these , @xmath131 , is dual to the bulk field we have been considering with the boundary conditions that @xmath132 for physical states .",
    "the field theory dual to the  standard \" quantization , where physical states are described by modes with @xmath133 asymptotically , can be obtained by adding the double trace term @xmath134 to the action @xcite .",
    "this is a relevant perturbation and the infrared limit is another cft in which @xmath131 has dimension two .",
    "the ads invariant boundary conditions we have considered here correspond instead to adding a triple trace term to the action [ ocubed ] s = s_0 + f3 ^3 this follows from witten s treatment of multi - trace operators in ads / cft @xcite .",
    "the extra term in ( [ ocubed ] ) has dimension three , and hence is marginal and preserves conformal invariance , at least to leading order .",
    "one might wonder if this symmetry is exact , or whether the operator @xmath135 has an anomalous dimension .",
    "the anomalous dimension can receive contributions proportional to @xmath136 or @xmath7 . since the large @xmath125 limit corresponds to supergravity in the bulk with ads invariant boundary conditions , and for every @xmath7",
    "there is a bulk solution corresponding to pure ads , it seems likely that the theory remains conformally invariant for finite @xmath7 ( at least for large @xmath125 ) .",
    "more generally , witten s procedure says that all ads invariant boundary conditions discussed in section 2 are dual to field theories that differ from each other by multi - trace deformations preserving conformal invariance .",
    "thus one obtains a line of conformal fixed points in each case the different lines of conformal fixed points are parameterized by several dimensionless constants @xmath137 . ] .",
    "we now turn to the dual field theory evolution of the big crunch solutions considered above .",
    "the lorentzian solution obtained from the instanton takes the form ( [ inst ] ) with @xmath115 replaced by three dimensional de sitter space , @xmath138 .",
    "so one might think that the natural dual would correspond to the cft on @xmath138 .",
    "this field theory certainly allows evolution for infinite time and is nonsingular .",
    "but this only corresponds to evolution for finite global time .",
    "we want to conformally rescale @xmath138 to ( part of ) the cylinder @xmath139 .",
    "this is equivalent to a coordinate transformation in the bulk .",
    "the relation between the usual static coordinates ( [ adsmetric ] ) for @xmath56 and the @xmath116 invariant coordinates ds^2 = d^21+^2 + ^2 ( -d ^2 + ^2d_2 ) is ^2 = r^2 ^2 t -^2 t since our bulk solution asymptotically has ( ) = + f^2 ^ 2 + o(^-3 ) this becomes ( r ) = r + f^2r^2 + o(r^-3 ) where @xmath140 .",
    "notice that @xmath7 is unchanged .",
    "hence the evolution of the initial data defined by the instanton preserves the ads invariant boundary conditions ( [ 4-scalar])-([4-grr ] ) . the fact that @xmath141 blows up as @xmath142 is consistent with the fact that this is the time that the big crunch singularity hits the boundary .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath143 is usually interpreted as the expectation value of @xmath131 in the cft .",
    "hence ads / cft predicts that in the large @xmath125 approximation the latter diverges too .",
    "a qualitative explanation for this is the following .",
    "the term we have added to the action is not positive definite .",
    "since the energy associated with the asymptotic time translation in the bulk can be negative , the dual field should also admit negative energy states .",
    "this strongly suggests that the usual vacuum is unstable .",
    "it might decay via the ( nongravitational ) decay of the false vacuum .",
    "perhaps a useful analogy is a scalar field theory with potential @xmath144 .",
    "the quadratic term is analogous to the coupling of @xmath145 to the curvature of @xmath146 , which is needed for conformal invariance .",
    "the second term is analogous to the second term in ( [ ocubed ] ) .",
    "qualitatively this theory has the same behavior as the bulk .",
    "there are instantons which describe the semiclassical decay of the usual vacuum at @xmath147 . for small @xmath7 ,",
    "the potential barrier is large , and the instanton action is large .",
    "so tunneling is suppressed . for large @xmath7 ,",
    "the barrier is small and tunneling is not suppressed .",
    "classically one finds that after the tunneling the field rolls down the potential and becomes infinite in finite time .",
    "this means that in the semiclassical description of this analogous field theory , evolution ends in finite time .",
    "the fact that the field becomes infinite in this scalar field theory is analogous to the divergence of the expectation value of @xmath131 in the theory ( [ ocubed ] ) .",
    "whether this means that evolution ends in the full quantum description of the cft remains a fascinating open question , which we are currently investigating .",
    "if so , one could conclude that there is no bounce through the big crunch singularity in the bulk .",
    "we have studied solutions of @xmath1 , @xmath2 supergravity where the @xmath0 scalar is the only excited matter field .",
    "since its mass lies in the range @xmath148 , there is a one - parameter family of boundary conditions on the scalar ( and the metric components ) that preserve the full ads symmetry group . when the parameter vanishes , the dual cft is the usual @xmath8 theory on a stack of m2-branes .",
    "nonzero values of the parameter correspond to modifying this theory by a triple trace operator .",
    "we find that for all nonzero values , there exists a family of ads black holes with scalar hair .",
    "both the horizon size of the hairy black hole solutions and the value of the scalar at the horizon are uniquely determined by a single conserved charge , namely the mass .",
    "since schwarschild - ads is a solution too for all boundary conditions , one has two very different black hole solutions for a given total mass .",
    "the uniqueness or no scalar hair theorem , therefore , does not hold in supergravity with generalized ads invariant boundary conditions",
    ". it would be interesting to see how a microscopic string theory description distinguishes between both classes of black hole solutions .",
    "although the modified boundary conditions preserve the full set of asymptotic ads symmetries and allow a finite conserved energy to be defined , we have shown this energy can be negative .",
    "thus the ads solution in supergravity with these boundary conditions is nonlinearly unstable .",
    "a particular manifestation of this is that there are asymptotically ads solutions describing the evolution of regular finite mass initial data to a big crunch .",
    "our motivation to study supergravity in this regime is that there should be a dual cft description of these bulk theories even if they are unstable .",
    "most interestingly , the field theory should provide a complete quantum description of the big crunch singularity .",
    "if states in the cft have a well defined evolution for all time , and one can reconstruct from it a semiclassical bulk metric at late time , then there must be a bounce through the singularity in the full string theory .",
    "however , if the cft evolution ends after finite time , or a semiclassical metric can not be constructed , then the bulk evolution would end at the big crunch .    as we mentioned , modifying the bulk boundary conditions corresponds to modifying the usual dual field theory on a stack of m2-branes by a triple trace operator .",
    "since this term is not positive definite , it appears possible there will be certain cft states which do not have well defined evolution for all time .",
    "we have seen this happening at the semiclassical level in the deformed @xmath8 theory for states that are dual to our big crunch supergravity solutions .",
    "moreover , we have good evidence that there are no bulk solutions that produce a big crunch in supergravity theories that are dual to stable cft s .",
    "this is because solutions of this type would violate cosmic censorship @xcite , which is believed to hold in theories with a positive mass theorem , even in anti - de sitter space @xcite ( see also @xcite .",
    "taken together , these results indicate that producing a big crunch in ads from smooth initial data _ requires _ boundary conditions that correspond to an unstable dual cft .",
    "therefore , the fact that the dual classical evolution ends in finite time and that the expectation value of the operator @xmath131 dual to the bulk scalar field diverges in the large @xmath125 limit are , presumably , generic properties of a dual field theory description of a big crunch in the bulk , at least with ads boundary conditions . whether this means the big crunch is an endpoint of evolution in the full string theory remains a fascinating open question , which we are currently investigating .",
    "if it is an endpoint , that would raise the issue what determines the boundary conditions at cosmological singularities .",
    "perhaps the ads / cft correspondence and the toy models of cosmologies we have constructed here could be useful to study this question further .",
