    "lets consider that @xmath0 is a compact riemann surface .",
    "then we can define a green s function with respect to a metric and a divisor on @xmath0 .",
    "suppose that @xmath1 is a hyperbolic 3 - manifold with infinite volume and having compact riemann surfaces @xmath2 as its conformal boundaries at infinity . also choose a geometry on @xmath1 which bears a metric of constant negative curvature .",
    "the main new results of this paper express the green s functions on each @xmath3 in terms of the length of some certain geodesics in @xmath1 .",
    "manin has done this provided that @xmath1 has one boundary component ( i.e. n=1 ) and is uniformized by a schottky group in @xcite . in this work",
    "we will generalize manin s results in general case , @xmath1 has more than one boundary components and is uniformized by a fuchsian , quasi - fuchsian or kleinian group .",
    "+ in this introduction we state the main definitions , motivation and the plan of doing the work .",
    "we start by introducing the definition of a green s function on a compact riemann surface for a divisor and with respect to a normalized volume form on it .",
    "let @xmath0 be a compact riemann surface and @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 integer number ) be a divisor on @xmath0 .",
    "we show the support of @xmath6 by @xmath7 . also lets consider that @xmath8 is a positive real - analytic 2 - form on @xmath0 . by a green s function on @xmath0 for @xmath6 with respect to @xmath8 we mean a real analytic function @xmath9 satisfying the following conditions : + ( i ) _ laplace equation : _",
    "@xmath10 where @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the standard @xmath13 - current @xmath14 .",
    "+ ( ii ) _ singularities : _ let @xmath15 be a complex coordinate in a neighborhood of the point @xmath16 . then @xmath17 is locally real analytic . + a function satisfying these two conditions is uniquely determined up to an additive constant .",
    "and the third condition is    \\(iii ) _ normalization : _ @xmath18 which eliminates the remaining ambiguous constant .",
    "@xmath19 is additive on @xmath6 and for @xmath20 , @xmath21 is symmetric , i.e. @xmath22 .",
    "+ lets consider that @xmath23 is another divisor on @xmath0 that is prime to the divisor @xmath6 .",
    "that means , @xmath24 . and put @xmath25 @xmath19 is additive and @xmath21 is symmetric , then @xmath26 is symmetric and biadditive in @xmath27 .",
    "+ in general , the function @xmath28 depends on the metric @xmath8 , but in the case that both of the divisors are of the degree zero , from the condition ( i ) we see that @xmath29 depends only on @xmath30 .",
    "notice that , as a particular case of the general kahler formalism , to choose @xmath8 is the same as to choose a real analytic riemannian metric on @xmath0 compatible with the complex structure .",
    "this means that @xmath31 are conformal invariants when both divisors are of degree zero .",
    "also in the case that the divisor @xmath6 is principal , i.e. @xmath6 is the divisor of a meromorphic function like @xmath32 , then @xmath33 is a 1 - chain with boundary @xmath34 .",
    "the divisors of degree zero on the riemann sphere @xmath35 are principal . then this formula can be directly applied to divisors of degree zero on riemann sphere . + it is well known that the green s function of the degree zero divisors on a riemann surface of arbitrary genus can be expressed exactly via the differential of the third kind @xmath36 with pure imaginary periods and residues @xmath5 at @xmath16 when the divisor is @xmath37(see , @xcite , @xcite )",
    ". then the generalization of the previous formula for arbitrary divisors @xmath27 of degree zero is @xmath38    in general , when the degree of the divisors are not restricted to zero , the basic green s function @xmath39 can be expressed explicitly via theta functions ( as in @xcite ) in the case when @xmath40 is the _ arakelov metric _ constructed with the help of an orthonormal basis of the differentials of the first kind on the riemann surface .",
    "the result of manin in @xcite which relates the arakelov green function on a compact riemann surface to configurations of geodesics in a 3-dimensional hyperbolic handlebody with schottky uniformization , having the riemann surface as conformal boundary at infinity , was extremely innovative and influential and had a wide range of consequences in the arithmetic context of arakelov geometry as well as and in other contexts , ranging from p - adic geometry , real hyperbolic 3-manifolds , the holography principle and ads / cft correspondence in string theory , and noncommutative geometry .",
    "a natural question is to what extent the result of manin can be generalized to cases where , instead of dealing with a single riemann surface , one has several riemann surfaces whose union is the boundary of a hyperbolic 3-manifold , uniformized no longer by a schottky group , but by a fuchsian , quasi - fuchsian , or more general kleinian group .",
    "such a generalization is not only interesting because it is a very natural question to pass from kleinian - schottky groups to more general kleinian groups , but also for its potential applications to arakelov geometry , to the case of curves defined over number fields with several archimedean places , while manin s result was formulated for the case of arithmetic curves defined over the rationales .",
    "we have focused on the formula in manin s work , that expresses the arakelov green s function on a compact riemann surface in terms of a basis of holomorphic differentials of the first kind and of differentials of the third kind . in the case of schottky uniformization , when the limit set has hausdorff dimension strictly smaller than one , one can construct such differentials in terms of averages over the schottky group .",
    "while the same type of formula no longer holds in the fuchsian or quasi - fuchsian case , we use the canonical covering map relating fuchsian and schottky uniformization and the coding of limit sets for the fuchsian and schottky case , to express the green function in the fuchsian or quasi - fuchsian case in terms of the one in the schottky case .",
    "the approach we follow for the more general kleinian case is via a decomposition of the uniformizing group as a free product of quasi - fuchsian and schottky groups and applying the results we obtained for these cases individually .",
    "the paper consists of three chapters devoted to the cases that the hyperbolic 3-manifold @xmath1 have 1 , 2 and @xmath41 many boundary components at infinity respectively .",
    "first chapter pays to the one boundary component case and includes four subchapter devoted to the foundations and the genera 0,1 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "also this chapter contains fundamental definitions and basic computations that are bases for the computations in the next chapters .",
    "the results of this chapter are a summary of the reference @xcite .",
    "all hyperbolic 3-manifolds with two boundary components with the same genera are uniformized by quasi - fuchsian groups ; the second chapter is devoted to this manifolds . in third chapter",
    "we consider the general case i.e. the case that @xmath1 is uniformized by some kleinian groups and have @xmath41 boundary components .",
    "finally , as a remark for the chapter three we show that for manifolds with @xmath43 many boundary components at infinity the situation is like the previous .",
    "i am grateful to matilde marcolli who suggested this problem , supported me in max - planck and hausdorff institute in bonn , and supervised me in all process .",
    "i also many thank saad varsaie for several useful and encouraging comments .",
    "in this chapter , first we gather some fundamental definitions and some useful notations that will be used in all of the paper .",
    "next we bring the computation of green s function for riemann sphere @xmath35 , the boundary at infinity of the hyperbolic space .",
    "all 3-manifolds with one boundary component that is a compact riemann surface with genus @xmath44 , are uniformized by schottky groups .",
    "the rest of the chapter is devoted to these manifolds .",

    "<S> the work is motivated by a result of manin in @xcite , which relates the arakelov green function on a compact riemann surface to configurations of geodesics in a 3-dimensional hyperbolic handlebody with schottky uniformization , having the riemann surface as conformal boundary at infinity . </S>",
    "<S> a natural question is to what extent the result of manin can be generalized to cases where , instead of dealing with a single riemann surface , one has several riemann surfaces whose union is the boundary of a hyperbolic 3-manifold , uniformized no longer by a schottky group , but by a fuchsian , quasi - fuchsian , or more general kleinian group . </S>",
