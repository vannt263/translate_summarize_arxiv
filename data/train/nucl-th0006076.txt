    "the issue of how to describe the interaction of a particle which is not on its mass shell has a long history .",
    "for example , in their derivation of the low - energy theorem of compton scattering in 1954 , gell - mann and goldberger @xcite took into account that the electromagnetic vertex of an off - shell nucleon is more complicated than that of a free nucleon . in case of the electromagnetic interaction , some restrictions on the general form of the off - shell vertex result from the ward - takahashi identity @xcite .",
    "it is a natural and legitimate question to ask whether it is possible to extract the off - shell behavior of particular interaction vertices from empirical information similarly as one , say , extracts the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon from elastic electron scattering . in this context",
    "one might think of the electromagnetic interaction of a bound nucleon @xcite .",
    "another example would be an investigation of the off - shell nucleon - nucleon amplitude entering the nucleon - nucleon - bremsstrahlung process @xcite .",
    "it has only been recently that the relevance of field transformations in the framework of lagrangian field theories @xcite has been emphasized in addressing this question . for the case of pions , compton scattering @xcite and pion - pion bremsstrahlung @xcite",
    "have been considered using chiral perturbation theory .",
    "it was shown that off - shell effects both depend on the model used and on the choice of representation for the fields . from",
    "that we concluded that off - shell effects are not only model dependent but also representation dependent , making a unique extraction of off - shell effects impossible . in practice , the freedom of choosing appropriate field variables has been used in refs .",
    "@xcite to obtain the most general effective lagrangian describing low - energy ( virtual ) compton scattering .    here",
    ", we will extend our previous discussion @xcite to the investigation of a spin one - half system @xcite which should remove any uncertainty that the results of the previous works somehow depended on the simplicity of a spin - zero process .",
    "as our toy model we take @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the covariant derivative of the proton field , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the proton charge and anomalous magnetic moment respectively , @xmath4 is the photon field , and @xmath5 is the electromagnetic field strength tensor . the fields @xmath6 and @xmath7 refer to protons and neutrons , respectively . for calculational simplicity , we neglect the electromagnetic coupling to the neutron magnetic moment . in the framework of eq .",
    "( [ eq : l0 ] ) it is straightforward to calculate the born diagrams of proton - neutron bremsstrahlung : @xmath8 u_p(p_1 ) , \\label{eq : nngborn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which corresponds to the usual choice for nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung for the electromagnetic parts .",
    "obviously , for pedagogical reasons , eq .  ( [ eq : nngborn ] ) has a much simplified interaction for the strong part .",
    "next , we perform a change of variables leading to different off - shell behavior in the nucleon - nucleon amplitude as well as the photon - nucleon vertex , and study the effect on the total @xmath9 bremsstrahlung amplitude . for that purpose",
    "we consider the transformation @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are real constants , determining the overall strength of the transformation .",
    "equation ( [ eq : wftrans ] ) results in a class of equivalent lagrangians @xmath13 where the explicit expressions of @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be found in ref .",
    "consider , for example , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , in which case the @xmath11 term will generate an off - shell dependence in the proton legs of the @xmath9 amplitude @xmath18   \\overline{u}_n(p_4)u_n(p_2 ) , \\label{eq : l1strongvertex}\\ ] ] in conjunction with a @xmath19 contact term @xmath20 one can show that in the amplitude the off - shell dependence from eq .",
    "( [ eq : l1strongvertex ] ) precisely cancels the contact term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : l1acontact ] ) . in the present context , such a cancellation for the charge , but not the magnetic , parts",
    "is simultaneously enforced by gauge invariance .",
    "a similar observation was also made in ref .",
    "@xcite for real compton scattering off a charged pion . however , the implication of field transformations is even more general , because it also has consequences for terms which are not fixed by gauge invariance , such as the magnetic terms above .",
    "the general case @xmath21 is discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the above result is a simple illustration of the equivalence theorem of lagrangian field theory @xcite , according to which all lagrangians of eq .",
    "( [ dl ] ) result in identical @xmath22-matrix elements .",
    "one can also make use of this observation in order to show that what appears as an off - shell effect in an @xmath22-matrix element for one lagrangian may originate in a contact term from an equivalent lagrangian @xcite .",
    "we conclude that off - shell effects can not in any unambiguous way be extracted from an @xmath22-matrix element .",
