    "degenerate dense plasmas have become a subject of important research over the last few years as those can be achieved in the laboratories @xcite , and can be useful for understanding the salient features of collective plasma oscillations in superdense astrophysical bodies like white dwarfs , neutron stars , magnetars etc . @xcite . in these plasma environments ,",
    "the typical number density of charged particles ( mainly electrons / positrons / holes ) becomes extremely high , i.e. , @xmath0 @xmath1 , and their thermodynamic temperature becomes low ( @xmath2 k ) , so that the particles follow the fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "the degeneracy condition in these plasmas ( where the fermi energy is higher than the thermal energy ) is satisfied for @xmath3 k. however , in metals ( @xmath4 @xmath1 ) electrons are degenerate at @xmath5 k. furthermore , in regimes , e.g. , in an outer mantle of white dwarfs , where electrons may be nonrelativistic degenerate , the number density and the temperature satisfy @xmath6 @xmath1 and @xmath7 k @xcite , and the magnetic field is @xmath8 t. however , for ultra - relativistically degenerate electrons ( e.g. , in the core of white dwarfs ) we can have the density @xmath9 @xmath1 and the temperature @xmath10 k @xcite . in degenerate dense plasmas there",
    "appear a time scale in the units of plasma period and a typical length scale @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the fermi velocity and @xmath13 is the plasma oscillation frequency . just like the debye length in classical plasmas , @xmath14 represents the scale length of electrostatic screening in quantum plasmas . in the latter , the typical quantum mechanical ( such as tunneling associated with the quantum bohm potential ) as well as the statistical ( fermi - dirac pressure for degenerate species )",
    "effects play crucial roles for the collective plasma dynamics .",
    "furthermore , in these high - density plasmas , the equilibrium density of charged particles and the static ambient magnetic field can be nonuniform with finite scale lengths .",
    "thus , there appear the @xmath15 drift ( where @xmath16 is the electric field and @xmath17 is the magnetic field ) , diamagnetic drift and polarization drift velocities due to the density and magnetic field inhomogeneities , as well as the quantum drift velocity caused by the strong density correlations due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "it naturally becomes a challenge to understand the properties of drift waves as well as the formation of localized structures in degenerate dense plasmas @xcite , as the quantum effects begin to modify the physical process at high densities .",
    "drift waves are typically low - frequency ( compared to the ion gyrofrequency ) electrostatic or electromagnetic waves that exist in a spatially nonuniform magnetoplasma .",
    "such waves are caused by the guiding center drifts of the charged particles in presence of a density gradient across the external magnetic field .",
    "various types of drift waves , e.g. , the electrostatic drift waves and coupled drift - alfvn waves have been reported in classical [ see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ] as well as quantum plasmas [ see , e.g. , refs",
    ". @xcite ] which play a crucial role in cross - field plasma particle transports @xcite , and the formation of coherent structures like solitons in space @xcite , laboratory @xcite as well as degenerate dense plasmas that are magnetized .",
    "note that both the drift - alfvn waves can be excited by free energy sources that are stored in the equilibrium pressure gradient and in magnetic field inhomogeneity . in astrophysical environments , since the parametric cascading of electromagnetic signals occurs , the drift waves may generate sufficient electromagnetic disturbance that should be considered in telescopic observations . furthermore , since the cores or outer mantles of compact astrophysical stars ( e.g. , white dwarfs ) are dense and may consist of a plasma of unbounded nuclei and electrons , i.e. , a plasma composed of positively charged ions providing almost all the mass ( inertia ) and the pressure , as well as electrons providing the pressure ( restoring force ) but none of the mass ( inertialess ) , and the magnetic field in these environments can be strong , the drift - wave excitation in degenerate dense plasmas could be useful for identifying the modulated drift - wave packets that may spontaneously emerge in magnetized white dwarfs , neutron stars etc .",

    "@xcite had investigated the nonlinear interactions of one - dimensional drift waves in presence of a uniform magnetic field as well as the density and temperature gradients in electron - ion plasmas .",
    "they reported the formation of drift - wave solitons ( non - envelope ) that were used for the onset of drift - wave turbulence @xcite in magnetized plasmas .",
    "however , two- or three - dimensional effects are essential for the drift - wave turbulence in classical , magnetically confined plasmas ( tokamak ) for the anomalous transport of charged particles .",
    "the modulational instability ( mi ) is a well - known mechanism for the energy localization of wave packets in a nonlinear dispersive medium .",
    "it signifies the exponential growth of a small plane wave perturbation while propagating in the medium .",
    "this gain leads to the amplification of the sidebands , and thereby breaking up the uniform wave into a train of pulses .",
    "thus , the mi acts as a precursor for the formation of bright envelope solitons or highly energetic rogue waves in plasmas @xcite .",
    "the amplitude modulation of a finite amplitude drift wave by zonal flows has been considered by jovanovic _",
    "_ in a nonuniform magnetoplasma @xcite .",
    "they showed that the full nonlinear system of equations governing drift - wave zonal flow interactions can be reduced to a cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) , which possesses localized envelope soliton solutions .",
    "it is to be noted that the nonlinear interaction between zonal flows and drift waves as in ref .",
    "@xcite involves one - dimensional propagation that belong to the convective cell mode ( with a non - boltzmannean electron distribution ) rather than to the drift - mode spectrum .",
    "though , such nonlinear interaction is energetically more favorable than one with zonal flows that belong to the drift - wave spectrum , there may be the situation when the convective - cell part of the spectrum does not appear , e.g. , in the dynamics of rossby - wave turbulence in rotating fluids @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that the presence of immobile charged dust grains may lead to the appearance of an additional term ( proportional to the dust - density gradient ) in the ion vorticity equation [ see , e.g. , eq .",
    "( 13 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ] which is associated with the shukla - varma mode ( convective cell ) @xcite in degenerate dense electron - ion plasmas .",
    "furthermore , the convective cell mode is not affected by the degeneracy pressure of electrons and the quantum force associated with the bohm potential .",
    "so , in degenerate electron - ion plasmas with no charged dust , the quantum effects may appear only in the drift - wave part of the spectrum .",
    "recently , the nonlinear properties of modulated one - dimensional drift - wave packets in a nonuniform magnetoplasma with the effects of equilibrium density , electron temperature and magnetic field gradients have been considered by shukla _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the dynamics of the modulated drift - wave packet is governed by a nlse , which depicts the formation of dark and bright solitons , as well as drift - rogue waves .",
    "furthermore , the nonlinear theory of cylindrical lower - hybrid drift - solitary waves in an inhomogeneous , magnetized plasma with the effects of electron density and temperature inhomogeneities has been studied by liu _",
    "@xcite in a two - fluid model .",
    "they reported a diminution of the wave amplitude and width of the solitary waves with the enhancement of the density inhomogeneity .    in this paper",

    "it is shown that the dynamics of the modulated drift - wave packet is governed by a modified nlse , which depicts the formation of dark and bright envelope solitons , as well as drift - wave rogons .",
    "we consider a nonuniform quantum electron - ion magnetoplasma in presence of the inhomogeneities of the equilibrium density and the external magnetic field @xmath18 .",

    "next , we neglect the ion motion parallel to @xmath48 as well as the compressional magnetic field perturbation ( i.e. , we discard the coupling between the drift waves and the quantum ion - acoustic waves ) @xcite .",
    "such an approximation is valid in a low-@xmath49 plasma with wave frequency satisfying @xmath50 .",
    "thus , inserting the parallel component of the electron fluid velocity , i.e. , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the parallel ( to @xmath48 ) component of the vector potential such that @xmath53 , into the parallel component of the inertialess electron momemntum equation , we obtain for @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the collisionless electron skin depth with @xmath56 denoting the electron plasma oscillation frequency , the following modified ( by the quantum effects ) boltzmann law for the electron number density perturbation @xcite @xmath57^{3/2}\\notag\\\\ & & \\approx1 + \\frac{3}{2}\\varphi + \\frac{3}{8}\\varphi^2\\notag\\\\ & & + \\frac{9\\mathcal{h}^2}{16}\\left[\\nabla^2\\varphi-\\frac{1}{4}(\\nabla\\varphi)^2-\\frac{1}{2}\\varphi\\nabla^2\\varphi\\right],\\label{electron - eqn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 with @xmath61 denoting the ion plasma oscillation frequency and @xmath62 the ratio of the plasmon energy density to the femi energy density . in deriving eq . , we have considered the semiclassical limit @xmath63 .",

    "furthermore , the drift - wave equation has been modified due to both the quantum mechanical and statistical effects .",
    "the latter also modify the expressions for @xmath78 and @xmath79 , which appear due to the density and magnetic field gradients , and can change their signs with the choice of the scale lengths of inhomogeneity . in the formal limit of @xmath80 ,",
    "i.e. , simply disregarding the quantum bohm potential term ( tunneling effect ) , one can recover the similar expression as in ref .",
    "@xcite except some factors which appear due to the different pressure law for degenerate electrons .",
    "we derive the governing nonlinear equation for the amplitude - modulated low - frequency @xmath81 drift - wave packets in quantum magnetoplasmas .",
    "note that the wave equation , which describes the evolution of the electrostatic perturbation @xmath82 has a harmonic wave solution @xmath83 in the small - amplitude limit @xmath84 .",
    "however , whenever the wave amplitude becomes non - negligible , a nonlinear mechanism for the generation of harmonic waves comes into play . in order to study the amplitude modulation and associated stability/ instability profiles of these electrostatic drift waves we assume that @xmath82 takes the form of a modulated wave packet , i.e. , the composition of a fast carrier wave with a slow variation in amplitude .",
    "initial drift - wave packets are modulated by the nonlinear effects .",
    "if we see the packet on the coordinate frame moving at the group velocity @xmath85 ( to be determined by the linear dispersion relation ) , the time variation of the packet looks slow and hence the space and the time variables are stretched as @xmath86 , @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is a small free ( real ) parameter ( @xmath89 representing the weakness of perturbation . following the standard reductive perturbation technique @xcite , we expand @xmath82 about its equilibrium value as @xmath90 where the perturbation @xmath91 can be considered as a sum of infinite number of fourier modes : @xmath92.\\ ] ] thus , we express the wave potential @xmath82 as @xmath93 ,   \\label{expansion}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 holds for real physical variables and the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate . in practice , only the terms with @xmath95 contribute in the summation , i.e. , ( up to ) first harmonics are expected for @xmath96 , up to second harmonics for @xmath97 etc .",
    "next , to derive an evolution equation of nlse - type , we follow the similar method as , e.g. , in refs . @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the modulational instability and the evolution of localized wave envelopes in space and dusty plasmas have been studied . here ,",
    "starting from a set of fluid equations , and using a standard reductive perturbation technique , a nlse has been derived which was shown to admit bright or dark envelope solitons .",
    "furthermore , the occurrence of freak waves or rogons associated with the propagation of electrostatic wave packets in quantum electron - positron - ion plasmas has been investigated by mckerr _",
    "_ @xcite . using a multiscale technique ,",
    "the authors have shown that the evolution of the wave envelopes can be described by a nlse , which admits envelope solitons as well as localized breathers .",

    "we obtain the following linear dispersion law for the quantum drift waves ( since we are interested in the modulation of a plane wave with frequency @xmath99 and wave number @xmath100 , we put @xmath101 for all @xmath102 except @xmath103 ) @xmath104    since @xmath105 , it follows that the frequency of the carrier drift - wave mode decreases as the quantum parameter @xmath106 decreases from a certain value , say @xmath107 .",
    "this is the consequence of relatively high - density regimes for plasmas in which a drift - wave carrier modes propagate with lower frequencies .",
    "the effect of @xmath108 on the wave modes is more pronounced when the wave numbers @xmath100 approaches @xmath109 .",
