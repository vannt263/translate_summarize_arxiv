    "the @xmath1 threshold cross section has the following schematic form in the conventional perturbative expansion of @xmath2 , @xmath3\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is a born cross section , and @xmath5 is speed of produced @xmath6 .",
    "the combination of @xmath7 appears to all order in the perturbation theory , known as coulomb singularity .",
    "the perturbative expansion in @xmath2 is not applicable to the threshold cross section because @xmath8 is of order @xmath2 near the @xmath1 threshold @xmath9 , and the coulomb singularity @xmath7 dominates the cross section . to obtain meaningful cross section",
    "the coulomb singularity has to be summed to all order in @xmath2 .",
    "the physical origin of the coulomb singularity is instantaneous gluon exchange between @xmath10 and @xmath11 which has a small spatial momentum @xmath12 .",
    "this is called potential gluon because of its propagator @xmath13 where @xmath14 , which is the coulomb potential @xmath15 in coordinate space .",
    "this understanding leads to a quantum mechanical description which is equivalent to resummation of the coulomb singularity .",
    "people had been looking for an effective field theory ( eft ) which makes the resummation systematic .",
    "finally a non - relativistic version of qcd was derived , called pnrqcd / vnrqcd @xcite .",
    "the eft makes the resummation systematic based on nonrelativistic power counting @xmath16 in lagrangian level .",
    "nowadays we understand the resummation using the eft , and higher order corrections are taken into account in the eft framework systematically .",
    "the nnlo calculation for the total cross section was completed by several groups @xcite , and now we are working on the nnnlo corrections using the eft .",
    "the eft classifies the corrections into three classes : +   + @xmath17 hard corrections included in wilson coefficients of ( composite ) operators .",

    "+ @xmath17 dynamical gluon corrections called ultra - soft gluon in the eft . +   + the hard corrections are related to re - normalization of the operators in the eft .",
    "the ultrasoft correction appears at nnnlo calculation , and the corresponding energy level correction is know by kniehl - penin @xcite .",

    "we discuss phenomenological significance of the nnnlo coulomb corrections using the obtained result .",
    "our formalism up to now is not specific to the top quark , actually it is applicable to bottom quark system replacing @xmath34 and @xmath50 by @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 exists in the @xmath2 and @xmath28-function in the coulomb potential . ) we investigate the quarkonium energy levels and @xmath1 threshold cross section in the following .    in the phenomenological analysis we use the potential - subtracted ( ps ) mass @xcite to make our prediction infrared renormalon free .",
    "the relation between the pole and ps masses is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is infrared cutoff of order @xmath56 .",
    "we take into account non - coulomb corrections for quarkonium energy levels known from literatures @xcite .",
    "so the results are complete nnnlo as far as energy level is concerned .      using the analytical expression for the @xmath57",
    ", we obtain the relation between mass of bottomonium and bottom quark .",
    "it might be instructive to show the results using pole and ps masses : @xmath58 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{-.6 cm } = 2 m_{b,\\rm ps}+e_{1,\\rm ps}^{(0 ) } \\big [ 1 + 0.19_{\\rm nlo } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{-.6 cm } + \\big(0.07 - 0.23_{nc}\\big)_{\\rm n^2lo } + \\big(0.09 - 0.19_{nc}\\big)_{\\rm n^3lo } \\big ] , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 gev , @xmath60 gev .",
    "the numbers are given separately for coulomb and non - coulomb to show numerical dominance of the former ( in the pole scheme ) .",
    "one can see the presence of anomalously large coulomb correction ( ir renormalon ) in the pole - mass scheme , while in the ps mass scheme this behavior is improved and convergence of the series became better .      in fig.[fig :",
    "psmass ] we show a scale dependence of the extracted ps mass @xmath65 .",
    "using extracted ps mass we are able to predict the masses of excited states of the spin triplet s - wave @xmath66 family . in fig.[fig : mb2s ] we show the @xmath67 mass using @xmath68 gev as a function of the renormalization scale @xmath29 .",
    "one can see that the large nnnlo corrections are preferable for scale @xmath69 gev , however the prediction overshoots the experimental value @xmath70 gev at the lower scale .",
    "the naively expected natural scale for the bottomonium is @xmath71 ( @xmath72 is the principle quantum number ) , which is @xmath73 gev for @xmath67 .",
    "this may indicate break down of perturbative computation for the excited @xmath66 family .",
    "similar behavior is observed for @xmath74 .      in future linear colliders remnant of toponium @xmath75 resonance",
    "should be observed as a peak position of the @xmath1 cross section .",
    "this enables us to measure the @xmath76 and extract the top quark mass from the data .",
    "here we perform an exercise , how precisely we can predict the 1s toponium mass when we fix the top quark mass as an input parameter . adopting @xmath77gev and @xmath78 gev ( @xmath79 )",
    ", we obtain @xmath80 scale variation between @xmath81 changes the total number only by @xmath82 mev .",
    "the small higher order correction implies that precise top quark mass extraction is possible in principle , in the total cross section measurement .",
    "( there are several issues in the total cross section measurement at linear collider experiments , see for instance @xcite ) . to obtain @xmath83  mass ,",
    "being more commonly used in high energy processes , from @xmath76 we need to know the relation between the ps and @xmath83  masses at 4-loop order , which is currently unknown .",
    "analysis using _",
    "large_-@xmath84 approximation to 4-loop @xmath83  - pole mass relation and direct extraction of @xmath83  mass from @xmath76 is available from ref.@xcite , which is consistent with our result .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss the coulomb wave function and the green function .",
    "since the complete nnnlo non - coulomb corrections and wilson coefficient of the production current in eft are unknown , we shall discuss only the coulomb corrections . as we demonstrated in the previous section , applicability of this method to",
    "bottomonium system is doubtful due to large nnnlo correction and slow convergence .",
    "thus we focus on the case of toponium coulomb wave function and green function .",
    "we show numerical formula for the @xmath75 toponium coulomb wave function at the origin @xmath85\\ , , \\label{toppsi1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 . to draw fig.[fig : wf ] we rewrote the eq.([toppsi1 ] ) using @xmath87 gev and took into account the mass correction eq.([psmass ] ) at given order of nonrelativistic expansion consistently .",
    "the figure shows that perturbative corrections to the coulomb wave function is reasonably small for @xmath88 gev and the scale dependence is mild , while in lower scale @xmath89 gev the corrections are too large so the perturbative expansion is unreliable in the lower region .    in fig.[fig :",
    "cs_order ] we show the @xmath1 threshold cross section as a function of cm energy for @xmath90 gev including only the coulomb correction successively from lo to nnnlo .",
    "the line denoted as `` nnnlo exact '' is a cross section obtained by numerically solving shrding equation for the green function using nnnlo coulomb potential .",
    "the result show a convergence of the perturbative approximation to the nnnlo - exact line .    in fig.[fig :",
    "cs_mu ] we show the scale dependence of nnnlo cross section for the perturbative green function with @xmath91 gev , and @xmath92 gev for nnnlo - exact .",
    "the exact green function is stable against scale variation ( so we showed only the case @xmath92 gev ) , while perturbative green function ( cross section ) is unstable against scale variation from 15 to 30 gev ( moderate change from @xmath93 to 60 gev ) .",
    "this is consistent with wave function analysis , where the higher order corrections were large for @xmath94 gev , so we may conclude that the perturbative expansion is not reliable in lower scale region .",
    "the nnnlo - exact contains higher order insertions of the coulomb potential to all order in eq.([expandedgf ] ) .",
    "the perturbative cross section agrees well with nnnlo - exact for large scale where it is supposed to be reliable from the wave function analysis .",
    "we believe that the nnnlo - exact cross section is reliable in wider range of @xmath29 , and the perturbative cross section is reliable only in the region @xmath88 gev .",
    "indeed we find that the multiple insertions of the coulomb potential give large contributions to the perturbative green function , and is slowly converging at small scale .",
    "thus we conclude that the `` correct '' scale choice for the perturbative ( coulomb ) cross section is @xmath95 , while choice of small scale may lead to misleadingly large uncertainties .",
    "we estimated yet unknown higher order coulomb corrections should be less than 5 % .",
