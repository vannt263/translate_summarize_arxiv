    "the inflationary scenario , in which the universe undergoes a phase of accelerated expansion in its very early moments , provides an attractive solution to the flatness and horizon puzzles of the standard big bang cosmology .",
    "in addition , via quantum fluctuations , it naturally provides the seed perturbations for later structure formation in the universe @xcite .",
    "after inflation , reheating leads to a radiation - dominated era , followed by a more recent epoch in which the density is dominated by non - relativistic matter .",
    "however , there is now solid observational evidence from type ia supernovae ( snia ) that the universe is undergoing another burst of accelerated expansion ; in the context of general relativity , this must be fuelled by an unknown component with negative pressure , usually called dark energy ( de ) @xcite .    the simplest possibility for the de is the cosmological constant , @xmath1 .",
    "data from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , large - scale structure @xcite , and snia @xcite are all consistent with the @xmath1cdm model , a nearly flat universe with a cosmological constant and nearly scale - invariant primordial perturbations . in the best - fit @xmath1cdm model , the vacuum energy makes up 74@xmath2 of the critical density , and the remainder is non - relativistic cold dark matter ( cdm , 22@xmath2 ) and baryonic matter ( 4@xmath2 ) .    while the cosmological constant is compatible with the current data , the recognition that the universe appears to have undergone more than one period of accelerated expansion points to the plausibility of alternative explanations for the dark energy .",
    "in fact , there are no consensus particle physics models for either primordial inflation or the recent acceleration of the universe . a first step out of our ignorance is often taken by introducing simple models , usually involving scalar fields",
    ". we can then proceed to test these models against data and obtain constraints on parameters that we hope can be calculated from a more fundamental theory . in this spirit ,",
    "inflation and dark energy are often modelled via scalar fields , called the inflaton and the quintessence field .    in general ,",
    "these two fields are treated as totally independent . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we introduced a simple , well - motivated model that unifies these two fields into a single complex scalar field .",
    "we briefly review this model below .",
    "we start with the general , renormalizable lagrangian describing a complex scalar field @xmath3 ; with appropriate choice of coupling constants , the associated global @xmath4 symmetry is spontaneously broken at a high energy scale @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the broken symmetry generates a flat potential for the phase of the complex field , @xmath6 , which at this stage is a massless nambu - goldstone boson . at a much lower energy scale ,",
    "@xmath7 , instanton or other effects explicitly break the residual symmetry , providing a small mass for @xmath6 , now called a pseudo - nambu goldstone boson ( pngb ) .",
    "the qcd axion , a by - product of a solution to the strong cp problem , is an example of this phenomenon .",
    "pngbs in the more general context are also sometimes called axions , a usage into which we shall lapse , but we emphasize that we are not here considering the qcd axion .",
    "the resulting low - energy effective lagrangian is given by : @xmath8~,\\ ] ] with the renormalizable potential @xmath9 writing the complex field @xmath3 as @xmath10 we identify the modular ( @xmath11 ) and phase ( @xmath6 ) parts of @xmath3 with the inflaton and the quintessence fields .",
    "a model in which the quintessence is such an axion - like pngb field was introduced by frieman _",
    "the model contains two mass scales , @xmath5 and @xmath12 , and one dimensionless coupling constant , @xmath13 . as in the qcd case",
    ", we imagine that the lower scale @xmath12 is generated dynamically , by non - perturbative effects , leaving @xmath5 as the only fundamental mass scale in the theory .",
    "as is usually done , we have set the cosmological constant to zero .    in order for @xmath6 to serve as dark energy ,",
    "it must have not become dynamical until recently ; otherwise , it would now be oscillating on a timescale short compared to the current hubble time and would act instead as non - relativistic dark matter @xcite .",
    "therefore we require @xmath14 where @xmath15 km / s / mpc is the hubble parameter today . on the other hand , for the energy density in the @xmath6 field to have the correct order of magnitude to explain the acceleration",
    ", we must have @xmath16 combining these two requirements results in @xcite : @xmath17 where the planck mass @xmath18 gev .",
    "this model was implemented in a hybrid inflation context by mass and zsembinszki @xcite .",
    "a model similar to ours , in which the modulus field @xmath11 is responsible for inflation and the phase @xmath6 produces dark matter , was studied in ref .  @xcite . in models in which the axion - like field is the dark matter , a high energy scale for the axion decay",
    "constant @xmath5 is also necessary , in order to suppress isocurvature fluctuations to acceptable levels . in our case",
    ", however , the axion field only becomes dynamical at such late times that the bounds from isocurvature fluctuations do not apply @xcite .",
    "the 3-year data set released by the wmap collaboration ( wmap3 ) @xcite has been used by a number of authors to constrain models of inflation @xcite . of special interest to us are the reported limits on the scalar spectral index , @xmath19 , and the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations , @xmath20 . using wmap3 plus the large - scale power spectrum of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , tegmark , et al . @xcite",
    "derive the marginalized constraints : @xmath21 note that the above constraints were obtained in the context of the @xmath1cdm model , i.e. , assuming that the dark energy equation of state is @xmath22 , and also assuming spatial flatness , massless neutrinos , and no running of the scalar spectral index with spatial wavelength , but allowing for non - zero tensor perturbations .",
    "dropping one or more of those assumptions would weaken the constraints .    as shown in fig .",
    "19 of @xcite ( reproduced below in fig .",
    "1 ) , under the assumptions above , a simple chaotic @xmath23 inflationary model is marginally excluded at 95 % cl by the wmap3+sdss constraints . since our proposed inflation model approaches a @xmath23 potential at large values of @xmath11 , one might worry that it is also disfavored by current data .",
    "we will see below that this is not the case in general ; rather , values of the fundamental mass parameter @xmath5 below a certain level are excluded .    in this model ,",
    "inflation is driven by the modulus field @xmath11 , since the potential energy associated with @xmath6 is smaller by @xmath24 orders of magnitude .",
    "the potential @xmath25 in eq.([potential ] ) in fact depends only on @xmath11 , @xmath26 working in the context of the slow - roll approximation , where the field evolution is slow ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) , we can define the usual slow - roll parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xcite : @xmath31.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] slow roll is a consistent approximation for @xmath32 ( in planck units ) or equivalently for @xmath33 .",
    "in particular , inflation ends when @xmath34 .    in our case",
    "we find @xmath35    defining @xmath36 as the value of the field @xmath11 at the end of inflation , @xmath37 we find two possible solutions : @xmath38 the solution with positive sign has @xmath39 and corresponds to large - field inflation ; that is , the field starts at @xmath40 and slowly rolls to values close to @xmath5 until inflation stops .",
    "the solution with negative sign has @xmath41 and corresponds to small - field inflation : the field starts near the local maximum at @xmath42 and slowly rolls to values closer to @xmath5 until the end of inflation .",
    "the number @xmath43 of e - folds remaining until the end of inflation in terms of the value of the field @xmath44 required to accomplish this number of e - folds is given by : @xmath45 there is a bound on the maximum number of e - folds between the time that the present hubble radius leaves the horizon and the end of inflation .",
    "the bound derives from limits on the gravitational wave background ( provided that the energy density of the universe does not drop faster than that of radiation after inflation ) and is given roughly by @xmath46 @xcite . in the following",
    "we will use @xmath47 and @xmath48 for illustration and denote the corresponding field value by @xmath49 .",
