    "the detection of the 511 kev positron annihilation line emission from the central region of our galaxy was one of the early and important successes of gamma - ray astronomy ( leventhal et al . , 1978 ) .",
    "although positron annihilation gives rise to the strongest @xmath7-ray line signal from our galaxy , three decades of dedicated observational and theoretical efforts failed to unveil the origin of the galactic positrons .    with existing instrumentation , the emission appears to be diffuse ; no point sources of annihilation radiation have yet been detected ( malet et al .",

    "there is no firm conclusion as to the origin of the positrons due to the modest angular resolution and limited sensitivity of @xmath7-ray instruments .",
    "further , the theoretical interpretation is complex since the distribution of the potential sources of positrons is unknown and many uncertainties remain on the composition of the interstellar gas , the structure and strength of the magnetic field in the galaxy and the physics of positron diffusion and thermalization .",
    "annihilation radiation from the disk and/or halo is still more difficult to study because of its lower surface brightness ( milne et al .",
    ", 2000 ; kinzer et al . , 2001 ) but it potentially provides complementary clues to the positron production processes involved .",
    "only a few instruments have been able to spatially resolve the disk emission from the brighter bulge one .",
    "previous sparse measurements had shown that the annihilation emission from the disk is brighter in the longitude range @xmath9 with very poor indications on the latitude extent ( gehrels et al . , 1991 ; milne et al . , 2000",
    "; kinzer et al . , 2001 ) . using more than four years of data from the spi / integral imaging spectrometer , its spatial distribution has been constrained in the longitude range @xmath10 and latitude extent @xmath11 ( weidenspointner et al . , 2008 ) .    in the following",
    ", we first present briefly the instrument and data selection .",
    "then , we describe the analysis method developed for our purpose .",
    "the background determination being a critical issue for high energy data , particularly for extended emission and when the data encompasses a very long period , we deeply investigate this point and make extensive statistical tests to validate our results . finally , the 511 kev sky distribution is derived using two approaches : an imaging method and a sky model fitting allowing to test several parameterized model distributions representing the galactic bulge , disk and/or halo .",
    "all the results are discussed and summarized in the last part .",
    "the esa s integral observatory was launched from baikonour , kazakhstan , on 2002 october 17 .",
    "the spectrometer spi ( vedrenne et al . 2003 ) observes the sky in the 20 kev to 8 mev energy range with an energy resolution ranging from 2 to 8 kev .",
    "it consists of an array of 19 high - purity germanium detectors operating around 80 k , the spectroscopic performance being maintained thanks to regular annealings of the detection plane .",
    "its geometric surface is 508  @xmath12 with a thickness of 7 cm .",
    "the assembly is surrounded by a 5 cm thick bismuth germanate ( bgo ) which provides background rejection .",
    "in addition to its spectroscopic capability , spi can image the sky with a spatial resolution of @xmath13 ( fwhm ) over a field of view of @xmath14 , thanks to a coded mask located 1.7 m above the detector plane .",
    "the instrument s in - flight performance is described in roques et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . because of the small number of detectors , spi s imaging capability relies on a specific observational strategy , which is based on a dithering procedure by steps of @xmath15 .",
    "each pointing lasts between 30 and 60 minutes .",
    "we have analyzed observations recorded from 2003 , february 22 to 2009 january 2 , covering the entire sky .",
    "data polluted by solar flares and radiation belt entries are excluded . in order to completely suppress the effects due to radiation belts and to secure the data set , we suppress also systematically the first and last 10 exposures of each revolution .    finally , after image analysis and cleaning , @xmath16 corresponding to 39294 pointings ( or exposures ) are kept for the present study .",
    "the resulting exposure map is depicted in figure  [ fig : expomap ] .",
    "the signal recorded by the spi camera on the 19 ge detectors is composed of contributions from each source ( point - like or extended ) in the field of view convolved by the instrument aperture , plus the background . for extended / diffuse sources ,",
    "we assume a spatial morphology given by an analytical function or an emission map . for @xmath17 sources located in the field of view",
    ", the data @xmath18 obtained during an exposure ( pointing ) p , for a given energy band , can be expressed by the relation :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the response of the instrument for the source j , @xmath21 is the flux of the source j , and @xmath22 is the background recorded during the pointing p. @xmath18 , @xmath20 , and @xmath22 are vectors of 19 elements .",
    "for a given set of @xmath23 exposures , we have to solve a system of @xmath23 equations ( 1 ) .",
    "for that , it is mandatory to reduce the number of unknowns .    a first way to do that takes advantage of the relative stability of the background pattern to rewrite the background term as :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is a normalization coefficient per pointing",
    ", u is the `` uniformity map '' or background count rate pattern on the spi camera and @xmath26 the effective observation time for pointing p. u and t are vectors of 19 elements ( one per detector ) .",
    "the number of unknowns ( free parameters ) in the set of @xmath23 equations is then @xmath27 ( for the @xmath17 sources and the background intensities ) .",
    "fortunately , a further reduction can be obtained since , at 511 kev , point sources are weak and constant within their error bars . concerning the background intensity",
    "we consider it variable and test several timescales . finally , we have @xmath28 ( @xmath29 being the number of time bins for the background ) free parameters to be determined .",
    "practically , @xmath30 39000 if the background intensity is allowed to vary on the one exposure timescale ( @xmath0 2700 s ) and @xmath30 6000 if the background intensity varies on a @xmath06 hour timescale .",
    "the global background count rate pattern on the spi camera can also vary but on a much longer timescale ( several months ) .",
    "we did not find any noticeable pattern variation over 6 months of data , corresponding to the interval between 2 annealings . with this compromise : hours variability for the intensity parameter and modest ( @xmath0 6 months ) variability for the background pattern ,",
    "we obtain adequate fits to our measurements with an optimized number of parameters .",
    "we performed our analyses in the 508.25 - 513.75 kev band .",
    "such a 5.5 kev wide band centered at 511 kev takes into account the germanium energy resolution ( fwhm @xmath0 2.05 kev ) including its degradation between two consecutive annealings ( @xmath31 ) . at this energy , the gain calibration ( performed orbit - wise )",
    "accuracy is better than @xmath320.01 kev .",
    "finally , only single - detector event data are used ( roques et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "the tools used for background modeling , imaging , and model fitting were specifically developed for the analysis of spi data and described in bouchet et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . to determine the sky model parameters we adjust the data through a multi - component fitting algorithm , based on the maximum likelihood test statistics .",
    "we used poissonian statistics to evaluate the quality of various sky models . the core algorithm to handle such a large , but sparse system is based on mumps software together with an error bar computation technique dedicated and optimized for the integral / spi response matrix structure ( amestoy et al .",
    ", 2006 ; rouet , 2009 ; tzvetomila , 2009 ) .",
    "the modeling of the instrumental background is an important issue within the data analysis . since 2 detectors failed ( detector 2 on dec . 7 , 2003 and detector 17 on jul .",
    "17 , 2004 ) during the period spanned by the observations , the distribution of the instrumental background in the detector plane changes significantly .",
    "this uniformity map or background pattern ( eqn .",
    "2 ) can be derived from empty field observations .",
    "the dedicated integral / spi `` empty field '' observations are rare . but by making the hypothesis that the 511 kev emission is essentially concentrated along the galactic plane and in the bulge , many exposures can be considered as empty - field observation at this energy . in practice",
    "we built a set of empty - fields using exposures whose pointing latitude satisfies @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , we exclude pointings closer than @xmath14 from cyg x-1 and the crab nebula since they are potential emitters in the 505 - 515 kev energy range .",
    "finally , 5729 from the 39294 exposures can be used to fix the background patterns .",
    "table 1 displays periods between consecutive annealings ( @xmath0 6 months ) , the revolutions spanned , the total number of exposures , the number of exposures used to build / test the `` empty - field '' and the statistics about the location in longitude and latitude of these exposures .",
    "we define the quantity @xmath34 to quantify the properties of the background pattern for each `` empty - field '' period ,    @xmath35    @xmath36 is the number of working detectors ( 19,18 or 17 ) , u and u are vectors of @xmath36 elements .",
    "u represents the detector plane count rates normalized to the mean .",
    "then , for each empty field period , we determine the background pattern as the time averaged vector u. figure  [ fig : fig5_6588 ] displays the resulting pattern for two periods .",
    "the difference between the two patterns is essentially due to the failure of two detectors ( 2 and 17 ) .",
    "to follow the pattern variation during the mission , we studied the evolution of this quantity for each detector .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig6_6588 ] displays the evolution of the count rate measured on 2 detectors for each period using the empty field data set .",
    "this variation is very small , except at the detector failures .",
    "we also tried to improve the pattern determination by allowing a time dependency or by subdividing each `` empty field '' period in @xmath0 3 and @xmath0 1.5 month period but the f - test shows that the fit is not improved . in consequence",
    ", we used the @xmath0 6 month period interval as defined in table 1 to determine the background pattern .",
    "as a final check , the distribution of residuals between our background model and the empty fields data has been tested against various statistical tests ( kolmogorov smirnov , run test , moments of the distribution ) and exhibit the expected normality properties .",
    "this distribution is plotted on fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3_511_6588 ] , compared to a theoretical normal distribution .",
    "this confirms , a posteriori , the hypothesis of a constant pattern between successive annealings and the absence of any significant source .",
    "another way to determine the background pattern is to solve eqn 1 for the source and the background simultaneously .",
    "while this method provides a better @xmath37 ( the global model being more flexible ) , the resulting patterns are model dependent .",
    "this is understandable in terms of an unavoidable cross - talk between the extended source emission and the background pattern . as a consequence",
    ", the large scale emissions are partially suppressed and the statistical differences between the models are reduced .",
    "futhermore , the patterns obtained in such way are not perfectly compatible with the empty field data set .      the backgound model has been tested on our total dataset ( 39294 exposures , see table 1 ) .",
    "the sky model consists of two point sources , namely cyg x-1 and the crab nebula , two axisymmetric gaussians of fwhm 3.2@xmath38 and 11.8@xmath38 to describe the bulge and a robin disk 1 - 2 gyr ( robin et al . , 2003 ) to represent the spatial morphology of the disk .",
    "eqn 1 is solved for @xmath39 and @xmath25 , @xmath40 being fixed and computed from the empty - field dataset ( 5729 exposures ) as described above .    first , the background intensity @xmath25 is assumed to vary on a timescale of @xmath0 6 hours .",
    "the residuals distribution between our model ( sky plus background ) and the data appears quite satisfactory ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3_511_39294 ] ) .",
    "secondly , @xmath25 is allowed to vary on the pointing timescale ( @xmath0 1800 - 3600 s ) .",
    "the f - test shows that the second option does not improve the fit .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0 6 hour timescale analysis produces slightly reduced error bars ( less free parameters ) for background and source components while their intensities are perfectly compatible with those obtained with a more variable background .    finally , the standard configuration used for the subsequent analysis consists of a fixed bakground pattern per period between two annealings with an intensity variable on a 6 hours timescale .",
    "the maps provide a model independent view of the sky but each pixel intensity is poorly determined due to the large number of unknowns . to gather reliable information ,",
    "a 508.25 - 513.75 kev sky map has been built using cells of size @xmath41 x @xmath42 ( figures  [ fig:508 - 514_sigma_map ] and  [ fig:508 - 514_intensity_map ] ) .",
    "emission profiles are also derived using pixels of @xmath43 x @xmath44 , the central one being subdivided into a finer grid ( pixel size of @xmath45 x @xmath46 ) . the reconstruction algorithm described in bouchet et al .",
    "( 2008 ) provides flux and error for each sky pixel . in this energy range ,",
    "the emission is almost entirely due to the annihilation line , the contribution of the other components being negligible .",
    "the emission profiles ( figures  [ fig : profilong511 ] and  [ fig : profilat511 ] ) are peaked towards and symmetric around the galactic centre .",
    "however , together with the map , they suggest that the emission is not limited to a bulge structure but exhibits an additional extended component ( galactic disk emission ) revealed by the long exposure .      with more than @xmath47 s of exposure time , a single gaussian ( e.g. kndlseder et al . , 2005 )",
    "does not provide an acceptable description of the bulge geometry .",
    "we obtain a better adjustment of the data with two gaussians of fwhm 2.6 @xmath38 and 11.0 @xmath38 , together with an extended component representing the galactic disk modelled by a robin 1 - 2 gyr disk ( @xmath0220@xmath38 fwhm longitude extension , @xmath05.5@xmath38 fwhm latitude extension ) .",
    "this two gaussian model has been used for simplicity .",
    "adding one or more sources simultaneously to the model , like grs1758 - 258 , gs1826 - 24 or h1743 - 22 known to emit above 100 kev , does not affect significantly the parameters of the gaussians ; none of these sources are detected above @xmath48 .",
    "however , a significant change is obtained by introducing 1e1740.7 - 2942 .",
    "it may reflect simply that the bulge profile contains small - scale diffuse emission structures , localized in the central @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore the modest angular resolution of spi makes it difficult to distinguish between point sources , point - like and small - scale diffuse emission .",
    "the gaussian parameters depend weakly on the assumed disk geometry ( for example the @xmath50 map is slightly peaked at the galactic center ) but remain well inside the error bars .",
    "we also investigate a more complex bulge shape considering different widths in @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "this gives @xmath53 and @xmath54 for the smallest gaussian and @xmath55 and @xmath56 for the larger one .",
    "the statistics do not allow the derivation of any meaningful conclusion , but in all cases , these parameters stay compatible with those of the axisymmetric model .      in a following step ,",
    "we let free the centroids of the gaussians @xmath57 which are moving together .",
    "the fit gives @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "these values depend slightly on the choosen configuration ( in particular we tried several widths of the gaussians ) , but all the parameters remain compatible . fig .  [",
    "fig : fig_contour ] shows the 1 @xmath1 uncertainty zone in the longitude and the latitute for the centroid . in this configuration",
    "the introduction of an additional source is not needed anymore .",
    "to go further , we built a model composed of a set of nested shells of constant density centered at ( @xmath60)=(-0.6,0)@xmath38 with radii 0 - 3.0 , 3 - 7 , 7 - 10 , 10 - 15 and 15 - 19@xmath61 .",
    "we thus obtain the 511 kev flux distributions just assuming a radial emission .",
    "we split each shell into negative and positive part for the longitude and then for the latitude .",
    "[ fig : fig_radial_b ] and  [ fig : fig_radial_l ] display the radial profiles we obtained which appear quite compatible with the combination of the two off - centered axisymmetric gaussians determined above .",
    "we thus conclude that the centroid emission appears slightly offset from the galactic centre direction .",
    "this result , while marginally significant , is all the more remarkable since kinzer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have found a similar shift of the bulge towards negative longitude in the osse / cgro data ( 1 @xmath1 shift measured between -0.25 and -1@xmath61 ) .    finally , we consider that the best configuration ( hereafter called the reference model ) consists of : 2 gaussians centered at @xmath62 and @xmath63 representing the bulge plus an extended disk component ( robin 1 - 2 gyr ) .",
    "then the best fit fwhm of the gaussians are @xmath64 and @xmath65 with fluxes of @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively , the disk flux being @xmath68 , providing a bulge to disk ratio of 0.44 . using the ratio calculated by kndlseder et al .",
    "( 2005 , table 3 ) to infer the 511 kev line luminosities and the factor ( @xmath69 = 1.64 from brown & leventhal ( 1987 ) , we obtain annihilation rates of @xmath70 in the bulge and @xmath71 in the disk .",
    "we then attempted to describe the extended spatial distribution superimposed on the central bulge with various spatial geometries .",
    "simple geometric shapes ( i.e. two dimensional gaussians ) as well as more physical maps ( co , nir , robin disk ( robin et al . , 2003 ) ) were tested .",
    "[ fig : traceur511 ] summarizes the result of the correlation map study , with the @xmath72 ( which varies similarly as the reduced maximum log - likelihood ratio ) plotted for each of the tracer maps .",
    "best results are obtained for a robin disk ( in the 0.15 - 3 gyr range corresponding to an old stellar population ) or nir / dirbe 240@xmath73 and 1.25@xmath73 maps , which happen to be good tracers of the @xmath74 line emission ( kndlseder et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "simple bi - dimensional gaussians of latitude fwhm @xmath75 and longitude fwhm @xmath76 give also good results .",
    "we note that the disk exhibits a larger longitude extension than the previoulsy reported values : first by osse ( kinzer et al . , 2001 ) , but the study is based on a longitudinally truncated data set distribution and more recently by weindenspointner et al . ,",
    "even though it is difficult to describe the emission in greater detail , this result represents a good indication for a bulge / disk structure .",
    "extended disk structure flux ( for the most plausible disks ) is around @xmath77 and the bulge / disk ratios range from 0.25 to 0.7 .",
    "this analysis excludes single halo models ( modelled by axisymmetric gaussians ) .",
    "however , in the past , osse data have often been compared with bulge models including some non - gaussian broadening ( wings ) , featuring a bulge + halo central geometry .",
    "we have tested this kind of configuration by considering a stellar halo ( or spheroid ) model proposed by robin et al .",
    "the central region profile is built following the law : @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 n represents a normalisation constant and x , y , z , the cartesian coordinates in the bulge reference frame .",
    "we obtain a good fit to the data with the axis ratio ,  @xmath81 = 0.8 ,  m = -2.6 ,  @xmath82=200  pc and @xmath83=8.5  kpc .",
    "the 240@xmath73 and 1.25@xmath73 nir / dirbe and robin 1 - 3 gyr maps remain the best tracers of the disk emission .",
    "we note further that assuming these geometries leads to higher b / d ratios ( between 1.4 and 2.1 for the best models ) since here b stands for the bulge plus the halo wings .",
    "to search for a disk asymmetry , we first used the galactocentric model and we divide the disk ( robin 1 - 2 gyr ) in 4 parts : a ) @xmath84l@xmath85 , b ) @xmath86l@xmath87 , c ) @xmath88l@xmath89 and d ) @xmath90l@xmath91 .",
    "the fluxes of these different parts are respectively : ( a ) ( @xmath92 ) ( b ) ( @xmath93 ) ( c ) ( @xmath94 ) and ( d ) ( @xmath95 ) @xmath96 .",
    "those values , while compatible with those of weidenspointner at al .",
    "( 2008 ) , support a symmetric disk within the quoted errors with a west to east ratio of 1.5@xmath320.4 .",
    "in fact , the main difference between both analysis concerns the background treatment . in weidenspointner at al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the background pattern is determined once per orbit and simultaneously with the sky fluxes .",
    "it thus becomes model dependent , inducing additional uncertainties in the results ( see discussion in section 3.2.2 ) .",
    "furthermore , we note that the disk flux in @xmath97 depends on the assumed bulge geometry and position and is hence model - dependent . now , using our best model for the bulge , i.e. the off - centered gaussian described in 3.3.3 , the split disk fluxes in region a ) b ) c ) and d ) are then ( @xmath98 ) , ( @xmath99 ) , ( @xmath100 ) and ( @xmath101 ) @xmath96 with a west to east ratio of 1.1 @xmath102 .    we have investigated the dependency of this ratio as a function of the bulge centroid .",
    "[ fig : fig_ratio ] displays the strong correlation between these 2 values and clearly proves that an asymmetric disk is not required by the data .",
    "we presented a detailed investigation of the morphology of the galactic emission in the narrow annihilation line at 511 kev .",
    "the period covered by the data encompassing more than 6 years , the background determination is a key point in the analysis .",
    "we have chosen to describe the background with a series of fixed patterns ( about one per 6 months ) , together with a normalisation adjusted by timebins of 6 hours .",
    "the patterns have been measured in the sky regions outside the galactic disk , with the advantage to be independent of the sky model .",
    "this method has been validated through various statistical tests and represents a major difference between our analysis and that presented in weidenspointner ( 2008 ) .",
    "while the reality might be more complex , the bulge morphology is well described by two axisymmetric gaussians , centered at @xmath103@xmath38 and @xmath104@xmath38 , with fwhm of 3.2@xmath38 and 11.8@xmath38 and fluxes of @xmath105 and @xmath106 respectively . while marginally significant , it is similar to the shift of the bulge towards negative longitudes seen in the osse data ( kinzer et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "we confirm also the existence of a disk emission with a longitude extent over @xmath107 and latitude over @xmath108 .",
    "many spatial distributions can be used to model the disk / halo geometry . among them ,",
    "the best fits are obtained with disk distributions extending over @xmath109 ( gaussian shapes , 240@xmath73 and 1.25@xmath73 nir / dirbe maps or robin 1 - 3 gyr models ) .",
    "the disk flux is around 1.7 @xmath6 leading to a bulge - to - disk flux ratio of 0.4 .",
    "this one ranges from 0.25 ( for the 1.25@xmath73 nir / dirbe map which presents a broad bump emission in the galactic centre region ) to 0.7 ( for less extended distributions like @xmath110 gaussian ) .",
    "this kind of disk emission morphology , widened in longitude , suggests an old stellar population as the main galactic positron source .",
    "+ when allowing a halo contribution ( robin stellar halo model ) , the flux reaches a value of @xmath111 , with bulge - to- disk flux ratios evolving from 1.7 to 2.1 with the same trend than above .    with our best fit determination ,",
    "the disk is found to be symmetric with a west to east ratio of 1.1 .",
    "it is clear that the disk results are very sensitive to the assumed bulge morphology , with a strong coupling between the parameters of both structures . fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_ratio ] illustrates that , considering the error bars on the bulge position , it is impossible to claim a disk asymmetry . the observed trend can be understood in terms of unavoidable cross - talk between both emissions ( bulge / disk ) in the common region : when the bulge is allowed to move , the reconstructed disk flux is affected .",
    "the integral mission has significantly advanced positron astronomy .",
    "we begin to have a reliable view of the annihilation emission from the inner galaxy , and can hope to possibly constrain the extended emission .",
    "it should bring some breakthrough in the quest for the mysterious origin of the positrons . at the same time , spectroscopy of the annihilation emission has yielded important insights into the conditions of the medium in which the positrons annihilate ( churazov et al . , 2005 , jean et al . , 2006 ) .",

    "<S> the 511 kev positron annihilation emission remains a mysterious component of the high energy emission of our galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> its study was one of the key scientific objective of the spi spectrometer on - board the integral satellite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , a lot of observing time has been dedicated to the galactic disk with a particular emphasis on the central region . </S>",
    "<S> a crucial issue in such an analysis concerns the reduction technique used to treat this huge quantity of data , and more particularly the background modeling . our method , after validation through a variety of tests , is based on detector pattern determination per @xmath0 6 month periods , together with a normalisation variable on a few hour timescale . </S>",
    "<S> the galactic bulge is detected at a level of 70 @xmath1 allowing more detailed investigations . </S>",
    "<S> the main result is that the bulge morphology can be modelled with two axisymmetric gaussians of @xmath2 and @xmath3 fwhm and respective fluxes of 2.5 and 5.4 @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we found a possible shift of the bulge centre towards negative longitude at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the bulge , a more extended structure is detected significantly with flux ranging from 1.7 to 2.9 @xmath6 depending on its assumed geometry ( pure disk or disk plus halo ) . </S>",
    "<S> the disk emission is also found to be symmetric within the limits of the statistical errors . </S>"
