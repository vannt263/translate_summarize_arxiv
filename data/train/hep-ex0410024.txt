    "searches for states , characterized by so - called exotic quantum numbers , i.e. , quantum numbers that can not be obtained from minimal @xmath8 or @xmath9 configurations of standard mesons and baryons , have taken place since the introduction of qcd and quark model . until recently ,",
    "these searches yielded very little conclusive evidence for such states .    during 2003 , however , the situation has changed dramatically .",
    "an observation of a narrow resonance at @xmath10 , called @xmath11 , decaying to @xmath12 , produced in @xmath13 , was reported by leps  @xcite .",
    "the state has exotic quantum number , positive strangeness , and can not exist in a simple three - quark model .",
    "a pentaquark interpretation was employed suggesting the quark content to be ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "this observation was confirmed by various experiments using incident beams of real and quasi - real photons , kaons and neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "afterwords , followed two other manifestly exotic s=-2 baryon states decaying to @xmath15 in pp collisions of cern sps at @xmath16 , reported by na49  @xcite .",
    "the combined mass of @xmath17 and @xmath18 was measured to be @xmath19 .",
    "these resonances were interpreted as @xmath20 and @xmath21 partners of isospin quadruplet of five - quark states with quark contents ( @xmath22 ) and ( @xmath23 ) respectively .",
    "the @xmath24 and @xmath25 states are consistent with being members of minimal su(3 ) anti - decuplet of pentaquark states predicted in the chiral soliton model of baryons @xcite .    in march 2004 ,",
    "the h1 experiment at hera reported a narrow resonance , the @xmath26 , decaying to @xmath27 at a mass 3.099  gev / c^2 @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "it can be seen as the charmed analog of @xmath24 with quark content ( @xmath29 ) .    for strongly decaying particles all reported states are unusually narrow with widths consistent with detector resolution .",
    "the reported masses of @xmath24 vary widely over a range , between 1526 and 1542  mev / c^2 , for different experiments .",
    "all pentaquark observations are based on relatively small data samples .",
    "typically 20  100 signal events are seen with a significance in the range from 4 to 6@xmath30 . while the @xmath11 has been seen by several experiments , an independent confirmation of the @xmath31 and @xmath26 states has not been made .",
    "definitely high statistics experiments are needed to establish pentaquark states unambiguously .    at this conference",
    "we report results of the searches for exotic baryons @xmath24 , @xmath32 and @xmath26 , produced in quark fragmentation in @xmath6 collisions at @xmath33  tev , using data recorded with upgraded cdf  ii detector at tevatron , fermilab .",
    "the data used in this analysis were obtained through three different trigger paths . the first data set was obtained by a trigger that was specialized for recording hadronic b - decays , the so - called b - hadronic trigger .",
    "it requires the presence of two displaced oppositely charged tracks with hits in silicon , each having @xmath34 , the scalar sum of the two transverse momenta exceeding 5.5  gev / c^2 @xmath28   and an impact parameter greater than 0.1 mm .",
    "the other two complimentary datasets were produced by the jet20 trigger , which requires the presence of a jet with an @xmath35 and a minimum bias trigger , which selects soft inelastic collisions .",
    "the data corresponded to an integrated luminosity of 220 - 240  pb@xmath36 .",
    "the jet20 and the minimum bias triggers are heavily prescaled resulting in effective integrated luminosities @xmath37 and @xmath38 correspondingly .",
    "in contrast to @xmath12 channel , the decay @xmath40 does not provide manifestly exotic signature as the @xmath41 is reconstructed as @xmath42 .",
    "however observation or non - observation of a narrow state decaying to @xmath2 at the same mass as in @xmath12 channel can be interpreted as positive confirmation or evidence against the existence of @xmath24 as this state is expected to decay to @xmath40 and @xmath12 with the same rate .",
    ".event yields of reconstructed resonances and 90% cl limits on @xmath11 yields [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the cdf experiment has accumulated 540,000 @xmath43 candidates , very cleanly reconstructed in @xmath44 , @xmath45 chain ( see figure  [ fig : dst](a ) ) . an ability to reconstruct reference @xmath46 channel",
    "is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : dst](b ) .",
    "the proton identification procedure was based on combined likelihood ratio calculated from measurements of specific ionization and time - of - flight for allowed mass hypotheses ( @xmath47,k and p ) .",
    "a track was treated as proton if the corresponding likelihood ratio exceeded 40% .",
    "the @xmath27 mass difference spectrum @xmath48 is presented in figure  [ fig : dst](c ) , there is no apparent narrow resonance signal .",
    "the expected mass resolution at 3.099  gev / c^2 @xmath28   is @xmath49 . the function superimposed in figure  [ fig : dst](c ) shows the result of the unbinned log - likelihood fit with the background function consisting of square root threshold function multiplied by the 3rd order polynomial .",
    "a series of such fits were performed with @xmath50 signal introduced as breit - wigner resonance function convoluted with a gaussian resolution function .",
    "the mass of the state was varied from 2.98 to 3.2  gev / c^2 @xmath28   with 2  mev / c^2   step .",
    "the resulting functions of 90% cl event yield limits vs @xmath27 mass are shown in figure  [ fig : dst](d ) for two cases  assuming zero natural width and assuming @xmath51 natural width of the resonance . as the final result we quote the worst upper limit obtained within the allowed search window @xmath52 .",
    "all results are summarized in table  [ table : dst ] .",
    "using high statistics samples of @xmath42 , @xmath53 and @xmath43 produced in @xmath6 interactions at @xmath7=1.96  tev and reconstructed with the detector having excellent momentum resolution and a powerful particle identification system we performed a sensitive search for narrow pentaquark states decaying to @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "no signal found in either channel .",
    "the analysis technique was tested by demonstrating the ability to reconstruct signals from standard narrow resonances having similar decay kinematics , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "the absence of pentaquark signals means that , if existent , pentaquarks are not produced in the process of quark fragmentation or such production is severely suppressed .",
