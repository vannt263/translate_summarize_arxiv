    "the renormalization picture has been extended to include a nonzero field @xmath8 and ising temperature @xmath5 , as well as next - nearest - neighbor interactions @xcite .",
    "it predicts that for @xmath11 the model undergoes an infinite - order transition to a long - range ordered phase at a finite value of the field @xmath8 . in the sos language this is a roughening transition , in the universality class of the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition @xcite .",

    "+ a different approach to find the shape of the critical line of an antiferromagnetic ising model in a field was formulated by wu @xcite who noted that these models can be mapped on vertex models , and that these vertex models have symmetry properties that impose restrictions on the analytic form of their critical manifolds .",
    "he also noted that the critical manifolds of the exactly solved vertex models are determined by the zeroes of homogeneous polynomials in the vertex weights that are invariant under the symmetry group of the model . on the basis of the assumption that the latter form of the critical subspace also applies to vertex models that are equivalent with antiferromagnetic ising models in a field @xcite , one may thus attempt to solve for the unknown independent coefficients of the homogeneous polynomial , the number of which is dramatically reduced by symmetry restrictions . in actual applications ,",
    "the number of equations is still not enough to solve all unknown coefficients , and additional numerical input is required , for instance from a numerical transfer - matrix analysis .",
    "this approach is more ambitious than the renormalization analysis in the sense that its aim is to describe the _ whole _",
    "critical manifold .",
    "it has been applied to the ising antiferromagnets on the honeycomb lattice @xcite and on the square lattice @xcite .",
    "the transfer - matrix data , with accuracies in the order of @xmath34 , could be successfully described by such invariant polynomials of relatively low order .",
    "nevertheless one may remark that these analyses did not provide solid evidence for the _ exact _ form of the critical line of the ising antiferromagnet .",
    "application of this approach to the triangular ising model leads to some additional complications .",
    "first , the topology of the phase diagram is less simple , which relates to the fact that the lattice is not bipartite .",
    "second , the 3-state potts character of the critical line implies that corrections - to - scaling converge less well in comparison with the ising case , so that it is not feasible to reach the same degree of numerical accuracy .    in this paper",
    "we compare the results of both theoretical approaches to our numerical data for the triangular ising antiferromagnet . in sec .",

    "the mapping of the triangular ising model on the 64-vertex model involves the introduction of bond variables @xmath35 or 1 between nearest - neighbor spins and summation over the ising variables @xcite .",
    "since the bond variables are independent , there are @xmath36 distinct vertices .",
    "but these turn out to have only 7 distinct weights @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",

    "thus we consider a point @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath211 in the vicinity of the kt point and apply a transformation such that the system flows to @xmath204 or @xmath212 .",

    "this equation determines the shape of the critical line near the kt point of the model ( [ ising ] ) and is clearly incompatible with the prediction of the invariant - polynomial scenario , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ktasympto2 ] ) .",
    "most of the the transfer - matrix calculations were performed for @xmath4 so that we had to use a binary representation for the ising spins , leading to a transfer matrix of size @xmath226 for a system with finite size @xmath227 .",
    "we define the spin lattice on the surface of a cylinder , whose axis determines the transfer direction .",
    "we have used two choices for the orientation of the lattice : one set of bonds parallel or perpendicular with respect to the axis . for",
    "the first case one may apply a decoration transformation to one half of the parallel bonds in order to construct a symmetric transfer matrix .",
    "however , the decoration of antiferromagnetic bonds leads to complex weights which we wish to avoid .",
    "we have thus used a non - symmetric transfer matrix , in combination with a suitable tridiagonalization method to find the leading eigenvalues .",
    "these were obtained for even linear system sizes up to @xmath228 , which corresponds with an actual finite size of @xmath229 nearest - neighbor bonds .",
    "the second construction , with a set of edges perpendicular to the transfer direction , leads to a symmetric matrix when two layers of spins are added .",
    "this allows the use of the conjugate - gradient method which is , in our applications , more stable than the tridiagonalization method .",
    "finite - size calculations with @xmath227 multiples of 3 up to @xmath230 were performed using this second construction .",
    "a sparse - matrix decomposition was used for both constructions .",
    "most of the technique is already implicit in the work of nightingale @xcite .",
    "further details are listed in ref .",
    "@xcite which concerns the case of the honeycomb lattice , but the essential steps are applicable to the triangular lattice as well . during the analysis of the results of both types of transfer matrix we found that they were mutually consistent .",
    "furthermore it became clear that the second transfer matrix , with a set of bonds perpendicular to the transfer direction , allowed a somewhat more accurate analysis . in the following",
    "we describe the situation of the second construction .",
    "for @xmath11 the transfer matrix decomposes in a number of diagonal submatrices characterized by a conserved number of ` strings ' so that the numerical diagonalization task simplifies .",
    "the transfer - matrix construction for this case has been outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite and enabled the study of systems with linear sizes up to @xmath231 .",
    "the magnetic correlation function along the coordinate @xmath154 in the length direction of the cylinder is defined as @xmath232 . at large @xmath154",
    ", this correlation function decays exponentially with a characteristic length scale @xmath233 that depends on @xmath0 , @xmath8 and @xmath227 @xmath234 and can be calculated from the largest two eigenvalues @xmath235 and @xmath236 of the transfer matrix : @xmath237 where the factor @xmath238 is a geometric factor , _",
    "i.e. ,  _ the ratio between the thickness of two layers added by the transfer matrix and the length of a nearest - neighbor bond .",
    "the significance of these relations lies in the fact that the assumption of conformal invariance @xcite links @xmath233 on the cylinder with the magnetic scaling dimension @xmath239 ( one half of the magnetic correlation function exponent @xmath240 ) . in terms of the scaled gap @xmath241 one",
    "has @xmath242 in the limit of large @xmath227 .",
    "since the three - state potts universal value of the magnetic scaling dimension is known to be @xmath243 , and the transfer - matrix algorithm evaluates @xmath239 as a function of its arguments , one can find a numerical approximation to the critical value of @xmath0 for a given value of @xmath8 or vice versa .",
    "the shape of the critical line prescribes the use of different ways in different regions . for small @xmath8 and large @xmath244 ,",
    "the critical line is almost parallel to the zero - field line , so that it becomes more efficient to solve for @xmath8 than for @xmath0 .    as a consequence of corrections to scaling , the solution will not precisely coincide with the critical point .",
    "the effects of an irrelevant scaling field @xmath131 and a small deviation @xmath176 with respect to the critical value of @xmath8 or @xmath0 are expressed by @xmath245 where @xmath246 and @xmath185 are unknown constants , @xmath243 , @xmath247 and @xmath248 for the 3-state potts universality class .",
    "thus the solution for @xmath0 of @xmath249 which is denoted @xmath250 , depends on the finite size @xmath227 and the irrelevant field as @xmath251 because the two correction terms in eq .",
    "( [ xhs ] ) must cancel and @xmath252 .",
    "we thus generated sequences of iterated estimates of @xmath253 by solving @xmath254 and @xmath255 in the equations @xmath256 for @xmath257 and @xmath258 .",
    "these sequences appear to converge faster with increasing @xmath227 than the @xmath250 .",
    "remaining corrections may be due to additional contributions to eq .",
    "( [ xhs ] ) , for instance scaling as @xmath259 .",
    "thus we defined @xmath260 by solving the equation @xmath261 for @xmath257 and @xmath258 .",
    "further estimates can be obtained with correction exponents @xmath262 , or by treating the correction exponents as a free variable in which case three values of @xmath184 have to be used .",
    "several variations of this procedure were tried which leads to some insight in the numerical inaccuracies of the fitting procedure .",
    "our final estimates of the critical points for @xmath4 are listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : critpts ] .",
    "the apparent accuracy of the critical points is satisfactory for most of the field range , but it deteriorates rapidly at small fields .",
    "nevertheless this region has our special interest : we wish to determine how the potts line connects to the kt point on the @xmath11 line , because this is where the theoretical predictions ( see sections  [ sec2 ] and [ sec3 ] ) are markedly different .",
    "we have also reconsidered the determination of the kt point at @xmath11 given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that work ,",
    "the finite - size data for the critical field @xmath28 were obtained by requiring that the scaled gap associated with the spin waves of period 6 , _",
    "i.e. ,  _ electric charges @xmath263 were equal to the expected value @xmath264 at the kt transition .",
    "these estimates @xmath265 of the kt point , which were obtained for system sizes up to @xmath231 , were found to be considerably size - dependent .",
    "they were fitted according to @xmath266 which led to extrapolated estimates @xmath28 that displayed only a remarkably small size - dependence . on this basis ,",
    "the final estimate was given as @xmath267 in ref .",
    "@xcite . in our present work",
    "we have reproduced these data for @xmath265 .",
    "we have not used the procedure that requires that the scaled gap is equal for two subsequent system sizes . since all points in the range",
    "@xmath268 satisfy this scaling equation asymptotically , the solutions may converge to any point in this range , depending on the corrections to scaling .",
    "this is another reason behind the discrepancy mentioned in sec .",
    "[ int ] concerning an earlier result for the location of the kt point  @xcite .",
    "we have used the @xmath265 data as input for several other iterated fit procedures consisting of subsequent extrapolation steps according to @xmath269 behavior , and powers of @xmath270 .",
    "these fits led to results for @xmath28 that were rather consistently close to 0.26 , with differences up to 0.02 .",
    "as an independent approach we have estimated @xmath28 from the requirement that the scaled gap based on the magnetic dimension @xmath271 is equal to the expected value @xmath272 at @xmath218 . since such fractional magnetic charges ( corresponding with vortices of strength 2 ) do not exist in this model , this scaled gap can not directly be calculated for a fixed system size @xmath227 .",
    "however , it can be obtained by combining free - energy data for system sizes @xmath273 , where @xmath73 is an integer , as explained in ref .",
    "the same extrapolation procedures as above were tried , and led to results again consistent with @xmath274 , but with differences up to about 0.04 .",
    "our final conclusion is @xmath275 , similar to the value presented in ref .  @xcite but with a slightly more conservative error estimate .",
    "the numerical results for the critical points are combined in fig .",

    "the invariant - polynomial scenario formulated in sec .  [ sec2 ] and",
    "the renormalization scenario formulated in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] lead to analytic expressions for the critical line in the @xmath32 diagram that are mutually inconsistent for @xmath277 at finite @xmath8 .",
    "this shows that at least one of the underlying assumptions must be incorrect .",
    "the renormalization prediction appears to successfully describe the numerical data for small @xmath18 .",
    "although the asymptotic regime is not quite reached ( as can , for instance , be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] where the leftmost points behave almost linearly instead of as a square root ) , an asymptotic expansion leads to an accurate description of the data , and allows a smooth extrapolation to zero ising temperature in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ shape ] ) . the analysis in sec .",
    "[ mcres ] of the critical amplitudes fits precisely in this picture .",
    "thus our analysis does not give reasons to doubt that the renormalization scenario correctly describes the essential physics of the model near the kt transition .",
    "in contrast , the invariant - polynomial scenario does not agree with the numerical data .",
    "it predicts a ` vertical ' approach to the kt point in the @xmath278 diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] ) where it should be horizontal .",
    "our interpretation is that the assumption of analyticity of the critical line in the @xmath278 parametrization is false at the kt point , so that the line can not be described by the zeroes of a polynomial of a finite order .",
    "since it now appears that the invariant - polynomial scenario fails in the case of the triangular - lattice ising model , the question arises whether similar , apparently successful , analyses of the critical lines of the honeycomb- and the square - lattice ising model in terms of invariant polynomials @xcite have to be reconsidered . here",
    "we may point at the simpler topology of the @xmath32 diagram for the honeycomb and the square lattices : the critical line connects to @xmath11 only in the lattice - gas points @xmath279 . in the case of the triangular lattice model , crossover phenomena near the kt point are responsible for the nonanalytic ` shape ' of the critical line . in the absence of such crossover phenomena",
