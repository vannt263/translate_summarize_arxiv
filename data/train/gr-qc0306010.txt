    "for steadily rotating , charged massive bodies , the gyromagnetic factor @xmath2 is defined as the ratio @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mass , @xmath5 the total charge and @xmath6 the angular momentum of the system .",
    "@xmath7 is the magnetic moment of the system , linked with the motion of the charges that are accounting for @xmath5 .",
    "with such a definition , in classical electrodynamics a rotating charged particle has a gyromagnetic factor equal to 1 .",
    "the same is thus true for any system in classical electrodynamics , with a constant ratio of charge and mass density . on the other hand , within general relativity",
    ", the gyromagnetic ratio for all charged and rotating black holes is @xmath1 .",
    "many points concerning the gyromagnetic ratio for isolated systems within classical electrodynamics , quantum theory and general relativity have been studied by pfister and king @xcite .",
    "the question we try to address here is the following one .",
    "how does the gyromagnetic factor behave for `` intermediate '' objects in general relativity , that possess a gravitational field weaker than that of black holes , but in which strong field effects are not negligible ?",
    "the aim of this paper is to try to answer this question by numerically studying the @xmath2-factor of rotating and charged relativistic compact stars , within the framework of general relativity .",
    "we use a self - consistent physical model , in which matter is supposed to be a charged ( insulator type ) perfect fluid ; axisymmetric and in stationary rotation . as it will be shown later",
    ", the only limitation shall be on neglecting the electromagnetic forces acting on hydrodynamic equilibrium , making our study a `` low charge '' approximate one ; but we take into account the electromagnetic field contribution to the total energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the variation of the gyromagnetic ratio as a function of the number of particles in the system , or as a function of the rotation frequency will also be discussed .",
    "details of the physical model are presented in section  [ s : model ] , section  [ s : resu ] is then giving results of the numerical study for two equations of state , which determine local properties of matter , and making comparison with previous works . finally , section  [ s : conc ] summarises results and gives some concluding remarks .",
    "we here give the most important assumptions made in our study ; complete details of the formalism and the way numerical stars are computed can be found in bonazzola _",
    "_ @xcite and in bocquet _",
    "@xcite for the magnetised configurations .",
    "we want to solve the coupled einstein - maxwell equations to get general relativistic magnetised models of stationary rotating bodies .",
    "we make the assumption that the spacetime is also stationary ( asymptotically timelike killing vector field ) , axisymmetric ( spacelike killing vector field which vanishes on a timelike 2-surface , _ axis of symmetry _ and whose orbits are closed curves ) and asymptotically flat . in addition , we suppose that the source of the gravitational field satisfies the _ circularity condition _ , equivalent to the absence of meridional convective currents and only _ poloidal _ magnetic field is allowed .",
    "we then use msqi ( maximal slicing - quasi isotropic , see @xcite ) coordinates @xmath8 , in which the metric tensor takes the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are four functions of @xmath12 .    with our hypothesis ,",
    "the electromagnetic field tensor @xmath13 must be derived from a potential 1-form with the following components @xmath14 the einstein - maxwell equations result in a set of six coupled non - linear elliptic equations for the four metric and the two electromagnetic potentials ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the right - hand side of this system also involves matter terms ( density and charge currents ) , which will be discussed in next section .",
    "the matter is supposed to consist of a perfect fluid , so there exists a privileged vector field : the 4-velocity @xmath15 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor takes its usual form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the fluid pressure and @xmath18 the energy density measured in the fluid frame .",
    "@xmath19 is the electromagnetic contribution to the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "following @xcite , we note @xmath20 and define @xmath21 as the lorentz factor linking the fluid comoving observer and the locally non - rotating one .",
    "we make the assumption that the matter is rigidly rotating ( @xmath22constant ) and that the equation of state ( eos ) is a one parameter eos ( ignoring the influence of temperature ) : @xmath23 and @xmath24 , with @xmath25 being the proper baryon density .",
    "the momentum - energy conservation gives an equation of stationary motion for the fluid , which can be written as a first integral of motion ( the electromagnetic contribution to the energy - momentum tensor is not considered yet ) , see @xcite @xmath26 we turn now to the electromagnetic part ; in order to have a complete charged body , with a constant ratio of charge and mass density ( see @xcite ) , we suppose , contrary to @xcite or @xcite , that our system consists of an insulator , so that currents originate only from macroscopic charge movement .",
    "the 4-current is thus proportional to @xmath27 implying that @xmath28 .",
    "taking then electromagnetic force term @xmath29 into account , the momentum - energy conservation reads @xmath30 the integrability condition of this equation is that the last term is a gradient , so that there exists a function @xmath31 such that @xmath32 .",
    "following the same arguments as in @xcite , there must exist a regular function @xmath33 , such that @xmath34    but , this gives too large a freedom for the distribution of charged particles inside the star .",
    "in particular , the charge density @xmath35 is independent of the baryon density @xmath25 , and the @xmath2-factor can , in principle , take any value .",
    "it is also irrelevant to compare the @xmath2-factor obtained in this way , with its value 1 in classical electrodynamics , where it is supposed that charge currents are directly proportional to mass currents and charge density to mass density @xcite .",
    "so we replace ( [ e : defgm ] ) by @xmath36 @xmath37 being the constant ratio between the charge and particle densities , it is an input parameter ( together with the central density and the angular velocity ) that controls the total charge of the system .",
    "it means that we do not integrate exactly momentum - energy conservation equation ( [ e : equi1 ] ) , since we neglect the electromagnetic forces .",
    "it will be shown in section  [ s : resu ] that this assumption is valid for low total charges , where the electromagnetic forces are indeed negligible , when compared to pressure , gravitational and centrifugal forces .      to solve the six elliptical poisson - like equations described in section  [ ss : field ]",
    ", we use _ spectral methods _ as described by grandclment _",
    "the complete numerical procedure is presented in @xcite as well as many tests of the numerical code .",
    "let us here emphasise that for our computations of spacetimes , we have very reliable and independent tests through the virial identities grv2 ( bonazzola @xcite , bonazzola and gourgoulhon @xcite ) and grv3 ( gourgoulhon and bonazzola @xcite ) , this latter being a relativistic generalisation of the classical virial theorem .",
    "grv2 and grv3 are integral identities which must be satisfied by any solution of the einstein - maxwell equations we solve here , and are not imposed during the numerical procedure .",
    "they are very sensitive to any physical inaccuracy in the model , including eventual problems in the equation of state . in the following , when presenting accuracy of numerical results , we will refer to the accuracy by which the numerical solution satisfies these virial identities . with the exception of results shown in figure  [ f : polyq ] , where error bars are displayed , we only show results with better relative accuracy than @xmath38 .    as presented by bonazzola _",
    "@xcite , a key point of the numerical method is to be able to integrate einstein - maxwell equations up to spatial infinity , using a change of variable of the type @xmath39 outside the star . this allows us to impose exact boundary conditions at @xmath40 , and to compute global quantities from asymptotic behaviour of the fields or integrals over the whole space .",
    "we can therefore compute values of the total gravitational mass @xmath4 and the total angular momentum @xmath6 , from the gravitational field @xmath41 ; the total charge @xmath5 and the magnetic moment @xmath7 from the electromagnetic potential @xmath42 .",
    "another global quantity characterising the star is the _ circumferential radius _ @xmath43 ,",
    "defined as star s equatorial circumference ( measured by the metric ( [ e : defmet ] ) ) divided by @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the coordinate equatorial radius . finally , we shall use the total baryon number of the star and its baryon mass @xmath47 .",
    "-factor as a function of the dimensionless ratio ( total charge ) / ( gravitational mass ) , for a polytrope .",

    "error bars are given by the grv2 test.,height=302 ]    to calculate the @xmath2-factor of a given model , in addition to the choice of a particular equation of state , one has to set the three following parameters : the central density @xmath50 ( or , equivalently , the central log - enthalpy @xmath51 ) , the angular velocity @xmath48 and the ratio between mass and charge densities @xmath37 ( [ e : prop ] ) .",
    "in this part we choose the eos to be a polytropic one , of the form ( 6.40 ) of reference @xcite : @xmath52 .",
    "we took @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where nuclear density @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we first want to test the validity of our assumption neglecting electromagnetic forces in the equilibrium of the fluid .",
    "we computed a sequence of configurations increasing the total charge , at fixed angular velocity @xmath57 hz and fixed number of baryons ( equivalent to 1.6 solar mass ) .",
    "results for the @xmath2-factor ( [ e : def ] ) as a function of the dimensionless ratio @xmath58 are displayed in figure  [ f : polyq ] , together with the errors given by the virial identities ( see section  [ ss : err ] ) .",
    "for @xmath59 , @xmath2 is constant at @xmath38 accuracy . for @xmath60",
    ", @xmath2 starts to vary , but this variation remains within error bars , that become very important as @xmath61 .",
    "this indicates that the fact that we are neglecting electromagnetic forces in the equilibrium of the star induces an error that is lower than the numerical one , as long as @xmath59 .",
    "it may be seen as a `` low charge '' approximation for our model and , _ within this approximation _ , we have checked with different equations of state ( other polytropes , incompressible fluid eos , strange matter eos ) that the @xmath2-factor would not depend on the charge .",
    "let us say here that , although we are neglecting electromagnetic forces in the fluid equilibrium , we are taking the electromagnetic field into account in the sources of einstein equations .",

    "indeed , the repulsive coulomb force acting on charged particles becomes comparable to the gravitational force and pressure .",
    "therefore , there may not exist any stationary configuration for @xmath58 too larger than 1 : the electrostatic force would overcome the gravitational one and disperse particles .",
    "moreover , mustafa _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that , in the case of a slowly rotating charged shell , when @xmath64 there is no upper or lower bound on the value of the @xmath2-factor .",
    "finally , in order to find an acceptable stationary solution for @xmath65 , one would have to satisfy both equations ( [ e : defgm ] ) and @xmath66 .",
    "these are , in general , incompatible for a constant angular velocity @xmath48 and one would have to allow for differential rotation of the fluid .",
    "this has not been done in our study and it would certainly be an improvement of our work . in the following , we will stay at @xmath67 an will consider that @xmath2 is independent of the total charge , in the low charge regime .",

    ". results for the @xmath2-factor are displayed in figure  [ f : polymbnu ] ( solid line ) , together with the value of the lapse @xmath69 at the centre of the star ( dashed line ) .",
    "the parameter varying along both curves is the central density and we retrieve the well - known result of the existence of a maximal mass for those stars .",
    "thus , the higher branch of each curve corresponds to unstable configurations .",
    "the newtonian limit @xmath70 is recovered at low baryon masses , corresponding to weak gravitational field ( @xmath71 ) . in more relativistic regime ,",
    "the @xmath2-factor follows roughly the variation of the central lapse , never reaching the value of 2 ( corresponding to @xmath72 ) , which corresponds to a charged black hole .",
    "the maximal value that could be reached ( for an _ unstable _ configuration ) was @xmath73 , if only _",
    "stable _ solutions are considered , then one has @xmath74 .",

    "the angular velocity @xmath75 hz is kept constant .",
    ", height=302 ]    the third parameter whose influence we want to study is the angular velocity @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , at fixed number of particles in the star , and fixed total charge , we varied @xmath48 from ( almost ) 0 to the maximal value , called _ keplerian frequency _",
    "( @xmath76 ) , where the centrifugal force at the equator compensate the gravitational attraction ( shedding limit ) .",
    "the variation of the @xmath2-factor as a function of @xmath77 , as well as that of a linear combination of the central lapse @xmath78 are displayed in figure  [ f : polyfmb ] . both quantities show the same type of behaviour : they are decreasing functions , mainly near @xmath79 , but the overall change is relatively small , when compared to that of figure  [ f : polymbnu ] .",
    "we have explored here high angular velocities , without any `` slow - rotation '' assumption , but the influence of these high velocities seems rather small .",
    "we have checked at different masses , always obtaining the same kind of result . here again , we see that @xmath80 and @xmath2 follow the same type of evolution , when varying @xmath48 .",
    "we therefore have plotted the @xmath2-factor , as a function of @xmath80 as shown in figure  [ f : polynu ] , when varying the central value of the density @xmath50 , like in figure  [ f : polymbnu ] .",
    "contrary to that figure , there is no sign of the maximal mass point , the @xmath2-factor being directly dependent on the strength of the gravitational field at the centre of the star .",
    "it seems that the gyromagnetic factor ( [ e : def ] ) might be another indicator of the strength of the gravitational field in self - gravitating objects : when gravity is weak ( well described by newtonian theory ) , we have @xmath81 ; when the star is very compact ( even unstable ) @xmath2 takes its highest values . finally , for a black hole , where gravity dominates over other forces , we have @xmath1 .",
    "-factor as a function of the compaction parameter @xmath82 , at constant angular velocity @xmath83 hz , for an incompressible fluid .",

    "the results obtained were qualitatively the same as in previous section .",
    "quantitatively , the trend described at the end of previous section ( figure  [ f : polynu ] and the following discussion ) , indicating that the @xmath2-factor be linked with the strength of the gravitational field in the star was retrieved .",
    "we found that the more compact the star , the higher the gyromagnetic factor .",
    "we checked this result with several other equations of state , described in salgado _",
    "@xcite , as well as with the `` strange quark matter '' model ( see gourgoulhon _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , which is giving very compact objects .",
    "still , none of these eos allowed for a stable configuration with @xmath87 .",
    "-factor as a function of the angular velocity , at constant compaction parameter @xmath88 for an incompressible fluid .",
    ", height=302 ]    finally , we present here the limiting case of an incompressible fluid : the eos is such that @xmath25 and @xmath18 are constant throughout the star . using this eos in spherical symmetry ,",
    "it can be shown ( see , @xcite ) that it gives an upper limit on the gravitational redshift at the surface of the star , when comparing with other eos .",
    "we here introduce a new dimensionless quantity called compaction parameter @xmath89 with @xmath90 being defined by formula  ( [ e : defrcirc ] ) . in newtonian theory , this is the gravitational potential at the surface of the star and @xmath91 . on the other hand , for a schwarzschild black hole @xmath92 and , for relativistic stars @xmath93 ( as derived by buchdahl @xcite ) . when considering charged objects the maximal value",
    "is slightly increased , as shown in mak _",
    "_ @xcite . in figure",
    "[ f : inccp ] , we display the dependence of the gyromagnetic factor on this compaction parameter .",
    "as expected from previous results , we find that @xmath2 goes to 1 , when @xmath94 becomes very small ( newtonian limit ) .",
    "we could not reach the maximal theoretical value of the compaction parameter for spherical stars ( 4/9 ) , due to the rotation and , perhaps , to the numerical algorithm ( we look for a solution by iteration , starting with a flat metric ) .",
    "nevertheless , we were able to get rather close to this limiting value , reaching the highest gyromagnetic factors for self - gravitating fluids , with @xmath95 .",
    "the striking feature is that the @xmath2-factor seems to be directly proportional to the compaction parameter @xmath94 and , if one extrapolates the line to the maximal value of @xmath94 , one finds that the maximal value for the @xmath2-factor would be about 1.9 , and certainly well below 2 . using only low charge objects ,",
    "this value of 2 is linked with the collapse limit that can not be reached with our stationary models .",
    "it is now worth returning to the dependence of @xmath2 on the angular velocity @xmath48 .",
    "if we fix the value of @xmath94 for the star , how does then gyromagnetic factor vary as a function of @xmath48 ?",
    "the answer is displayed in figure  [ f : incfc ] , still in the case of an incompressible fluid .",
    "we see that the dependence is very small , only about one percent of variation between the non - rotating limit and the shedding one .",
    "results shown in figure  [ f : polyfmb ] can have a new interpretation : when @xmath48 is increased , @xmath94 decreases because of centrifugal forces that go against gravity and therefore make @xmath90 increase . gravitational potential at the surface of the star decreases because of the rotation , the same being true for the gravitational field @xmath69 at the centre .",
    "the gyromagnetic factor indicates that , at high angular velocities , the star is less gravitationally bound . comparing different models , equally bound , but with different rotation rates ( figure  [ f : incfc ] ) , we see that the effect of rotation is small , and must act on the increase of @xmath2 through the addition of kinetic energy that contributes to the source terms of einstein equations .",
    "there have been some studies of the gyromagnetic factor in general relativity , but none of them has considered physically consistent matter models .",
    "much of interesting work has been done for slowly rotating charged shells , starting with that of cohen _ et al .",
    "the study that may be most closely related to ours is that by pfister and king @xcite , where the authors calculate explicitly the gyromagnetic factor of a charged mass shell in slow rotation approximation .",
    "the shell is infinitely thin and the authors match two exact solutions of the einstein equations in vacuum across it .",
    "the properties of the energy - momentum tensor are then deduced from the matching of both metrics .",
    "the advantage of their solutions is that they were able to explore regimes with a very high charge and compaction parameter .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to compare quantitatively their results with ours since one knows very little about the properties of shell matter which , apart from energy conditions , are not constrained .",
    "one might suppose that , in general , these shells are not behaving like perfect fluids .",
    "qualitatively , both studies agree : for @xmath96 and taking into account energy conditions , pfister and king find that @xmath2 varies between @xmath97 , for a low compaction parameter , and 2 in the collapse limit . with a similar kind of problem , mustafa _ et al . _ @xcite found that @xmath2 could reach values very close to 2 , for the charge - to - mass ratio less than unity and for the shell radius approaching the event horizon value .",
    "garfinkle and traschen @xcite have calculated the @xmath2-factor of a rotating massive loop of charged matter in the presence of a static charged black hole . they have found that , for large radii of the loop , @xmath2 tended to 1 , whereas they found @xmath98 for the radius approaching the horizon .",
    "we retrieve ( again qualitatively ) the same results for our self - gravitating and three - dimensional objects : a loop at spatial infinity might be seen as undergoing a weak gravitational field , just like self - gravitating body with a low compaction parameter .",
    "let us also mention here the very interesting work by katz _",
    "et al . _ , who calculated the gyromagnetic ratio in a conformastationary metric @xcite .",
    "these axially symmetric metrics can be seen as the external metrics for disc sources , made of charged dust .",
    "they show that in those discs , hoop tensions are always necessary to balance the centrifugal forces induced by the motion of the rotating dust .",
    "the model therefore correspond to non - perfect fluid , and they find @xmath1 ( with our definition ) for these metrics .",
    "we have studied the dependence of the gyromagnetic ratio ( [ e : def ] ) of self - gravitating rotating fluids on their mass ( number of particles ) , angular velocity and equation of state .",
    "we have used a physical model in which we make the assumption that the fluid is an insulator in uniform rotation , and we have neglected the electromagnetic forces acting on the equilibrium of the fluid ( low charge approximation ) .",
    "these models have been solved numerically , with a code giving the solution in all space , which enabled us to get the value of @xmath2 with a high accuracy ( better than @xmath38 ) given by independent tests .",
    "we find that , with such `` stars '' , @xmath2 can never reach the value 2 , characteristic of a charged rotating black hole .",
    "the maximal value that can be achieved in our study is lower than 1.9 .",
    "this gap may be linked with the fact that we have neglected electromagnetic forces on hydrodynamic equilibrium and our study has therefore been restricted to low charge - to - mass ratios .",
    "but it might also be a result of that stationary relativistic stars , made of perfect fluid , can not reach values of the compaction parameter @xmath0 close to 1/2 . in that sense ,",
    "the @xmath2-factor is a good indicator of the strength of the gravitational field in an insulating perfect fluid , but is little dependent on the angular velocity of the star . in our study",
    ", the value @xmath1 seems linked only with the black hole solution but , from other works , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , one can see that this may depend on the total charge of the system .",
    "an important improvement of our work would be to allow for any charge of the system , that is compatible with the stationarity assumption and therefore allow for differential rotation , which may open new possibilities .",
    "we are grateful to h pfister for suggesting this study and stimulating discussions .",
    "we also thank j bik and p peter who gave us very helpful comments on the gyromagnetic ratio in relativity ."
