    "the notion that neutron stars exist with surface magnetic fields as high as @xmath6  g has become generally accepted over the last decade .",
    "the most spectacular manifestations of these so - called magnetars are arguably the soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) , which have received ample attention after the giant flare of sgr1806 - 20 on december 27 , 2004 , which had an energy of @xmath7  erg ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "related to the class of sgrs are the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , which are less prone to flare , although occasional flares have been observed @xcite .",
    "like sgrs they are radio quiet x - ray pulsars with spin periods in the range of 5 - 12 s. the timing properties of both sgrs and axps suggest that they are isolated neutron stars , whereas their spin down rate suggest that they have magnetar - like dipole magnetic fields of @xmath8  g ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "other arguments in favour of the magnetar hypothesis can be found in @xcite .",
    "the apparent dichotomy between the radio quiet magnetars , on the one hand , and ordinary young radio pulsars , with @xmath9  g , on the other hand , is likely to originate from distinct properties of the progenitor stars .",
    "one idea is that the high magnetic field of magnetars simply reflects the high magnetic field of their progenitor stars .",
    "magnetic flux conservation @xcite implies that magnetars must then be the stellar remnants of stars with internal magnetic fields of @xmath10  g , whereas radio pulsars must be the end products of stars with @xmath11  g. based on a study of magnetic white dwarfs , @xcite argue that there is a wide spread in white dwarf progenitor magnetic fields , which , when extrapolated to the more massive progenitors of neutron stars can explain the existence of magnetars .",

    "derived energies scale with distance @xmath32 as @xmath33 .",
    "distances and pulsar ages ( @xmath34 ) are taken from @xcite .",
    "a currently more popular idea for the origin of magnetars is that they are formed from proto - neutron stars with periods in the range @xmath35  ms ( the break - up limit ) to 3  ms .",
    "convection and differential rotation in such rapidly rotating stars would give rise to an efficient @xmath36-dynamo , resulting in magnetic field amplification on a time scale of @xmath37  s @xcite .",
    "in contrast , radio pulsars presumably start their life with initial spin periods of @xmath38  ms or longer .",
    "as initially pointed out by @xcite , the idea that magnetars form from proton - neutron stars with @xmath39  ms implies that supernova explosions that create magnetars are an order of magnitude more energetic than ordinary core collapse supernovae .",
    "the reason is that a neutron star spinning with @xmath40  ms ( @xmath41  s@xmath42 ) has a rotational energy of @xmath43  erg , for a moment of inertia of @xmath44  g@xmath45 @xcite . due to the high magnetic field",
    ", the magnetar rapidly spins down during the explosion , thereby powering the supernova .",
    "an upper limit for the time scale in which most of the rotational energy is lost by a neutron star with @xmath46  g is obtained by assuming magnetic braking in vacuum , @xmath47  s. more detailed modeling by @xcite indicates that the time scale for spin down of the proto - neutron star may be as short as 10 - 100  s.    given the implication of the millisecond proto - neutron star hypothesis that magnetars should be surrounded by _",
    "remnants , it is surprising that this idea has not directly been tested on supernova remnants ( snrs ) associated with axps and sgrs , although @xcite did calculate the effect of the hypernova / magnetar connection on the evolution of the snr , and applied this to known magnetar / snr connections . here",
    "we review what is known about the explosion energies of the supernova remnants kes 73 , n49 and ctb 109 associated with respectively the magnetar candidates axp 1e1841 - 045 , sgr 0526 - 66 , and axp 1e2259 + 586 . for ctb 109 and n49 explosion energy estimates have been given in the literature , but without discussing the possible implications for the magnetar formation scenario .",
    "as far as we know , no explosion energy estimates exists for kes 73 , we therefore present our own energy estimate based on archival _ xmm - newton _  observations .",
    "in addition we present an analysis of the explosion energy of n49 , also based on unpublished _ xmm - newton _  data .",
    "@xcite reviewed the association of axps and sgrs with snrs , taking into account the probability of random spatial coincidence given the extent of the snr and the location of the axp or sgr within the snr .",
    "he concludes that magnetar candidates likely to be associated with snrs ( i.e. have a chance alignment probability @xmath48 1% ) are : axp 1e1841 - 045 with kes 73 ( g27.4 + 0.0 ) , axp 1e2259 + 586 with ctb 109 ( g109.1 - 1.0 ) , sgr 0526 - 66 with n49 , and the candidate axp ax j1845 - 045 with g29.6 + 0.1 .",
    "g29.6 + 0.1 , a shell - type snr , was detected in archival radio data @xcite following the discovery of ax j1845 - 045 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the x - ray emission from the snr is too weak @xcite and the distance too poorly constrained @xcite to derive any meaningful energy estimate from the x - ray spectrum of the snr .",
    "this leaves us with kes 73 , n49 and ctb 109 to test whether snrs with magnetars are an order of magnitude more energetic than regular snrs .",
    "one can determine the energy of snrs using the well known sedov evolution of an adiabatic point explosion in a uniform medium @xcite .",
    "the shock radius , @xmath49 , and velocity , @xmath50 , of such an explosion evolves as @xmath51 @xmath52 with @xmath53 the interstellar medium density , @xmath54 the explosion energy , and @xmath55 the age of the snr .",
    "the shock velocity can be determined from x - ray spectra , because for a monatomic gas and high mach number shocks the following relation holds between post - shock plasma temperature and shock velocity : @xmath56 with @xmath57 the proton mass .",
    "the factor 0.63 gives the average particle mass in units of the proton mass .",
    "it is smaller than the proton mass , because it includes electrons .",
    "so from measuring the temperature one can estimate @xmath50 , which , combined with the measured radius , gives the age of the snr ( eq .  [ sedov ] & [ sedov2 ] ) .",
    "the interstellar medium density can be estimated from the x - ray emission measure ( em @xmath58 ) . having obtained a density estimate , the explosion energy can be calculated using eq .",
    "[ sedov ] .",
    "we list the results of our analysis of _ xmm - newton _  data in table  [ tab - energies ] , together with the parameters for ctb 109 reported by @xcite .",
    "it is clear that these snrs with magnetars do not have an order of magnitude higher explosion energies than the canonical supernova explosion energy of @xmath4  erg , suggesting an initial period @xmath59  ms .",
    "more details about our analysis data can be found in the appendix , which also includes a short discussion on the effects of non - equilibration of temperatures on the derived parameters , and on the applicability of the sedov model for kes 73 .",
    "figure [ fig - spectra ] shows the _ xmm - newton _  spectra of kes 73 and n49 with best fit spectral models .",
    "for all three snrs the distances are well determined .",
    "n49 is located in the large magellanic cloud , kes 73 has a reliable distance estimate based on hi absorption measurements ( @xmath60  kpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ctb 109 can not be more distant than cas a , which is situated at 2  from ctb 109 , has a higher absorption column , and is at a distance of 3.4  kpc @xcite . both tb109 and cas  a are likely to be associated with the perseus arm at @xmath1  kpc .    as an aside , cas a contains a point source that is suspected to be a magnetar ( see *",
    "* for a discussion ) , a suspicion that has gained more credibility with the recent discovery of an infra - red light echo from a putative sgr - like giant flare @xcite .",
    "however , cas a appears to have an explosion energy of @xmath61  erg , which is quite accurately known , as the expansion has been directly measured ( * ? ? ? * for a review ) .    we like to conclude this section by pointing out that",
    ", although there are some uncertainties associated with determining the explosion energies using a sedov analysis ( gradients in the medium in which the snr evolves , conversion of part of the energy to cosmic rays ) , these uncertainties apply equally to all other snrs for which energies have been determined . nevertheless , other snrs appear to have similar explosion energies @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the most remarkable feature of snrs with magnetars is that they are unremarkable , i.e. they are indistinguishable from normal snrs .",
    "this study shows that _ in general _ magnetar formation is not accompanied by a hypernova explosion .",
    "this does not necessarily preclude the idea that observed extra - galactic hypernovae , such as sn1998bw , are not by the formation of a rapidly spinning magnetar followed by rapid magnetic braking @xcite , but it poses a challenge to the hypothesis that magnetars are formed as a result of magnetic field amplification in a rapidly spinning ( @xmath62  ms ) proto - neutron star .",
    "note that when the magnetar theory of sgrs and axps was first proposed , the existence of magnetars was hardly an established fact @xcite . today",
    "their existence is only doubted by a few , especially after the giant flare of sgr1806 - 20 . in general ,",
    "sgr flare luminosities exceed the eddington luminosity , making it hard to find any other source of energy but the internal magnetic field .",
    "the energy of the giant flare of sgr1806 - 20 was @xmath7  erg @xcite .",
    "if a neutron star has several of those flares this energy can only be provided with an internal magnetic field of @xmath63  g ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . moreover , the results presented do not rule out initial periods of @xmath1  ms , the upper limit at which the @xmath36  dynamo may operate @xcite .",
    "the generation of such a high internal magnetic field poses challenges in itself .",
    "the magnetar - sized magnetic fields may either derive from a high magnetic field in the core of the neutron star progenitor ( the fossil field hypothesis ) , or may be generated in the proto - neutron star , in which case rapid rotation and strong convective motions and/or differential rotation are needed .",
    "it is indeed shown that proto - neutron stars are highly convective @xcite , although @xcite express some doubt whether it is sufficient to generate magnetic fields in excess of @xmath64  g. the rapid rotation needed for amplifying magnetic fields in proto - neutron stars may reflect the high angular momentum of the progenitor s core .",
    "however , the proto - neutron star may also wind up due to asymmetric accretion during collapse , in which case it is expected that the accretion results in both additional spin and kick velocity @xcite .    for the fossil field hypothesis",
    ", the solution to the question what the origin of the high magnetic field is , creates itself a new problem , namely , what is the origin of the high magnetic field of the progenitor star ?",
    "it could be that the magnetic field is again the result of the amplification of a seed magnetic field due to rotation and convection , but in this case in the core of the progenitor .",
    "however , as noted by @xcite , there is less convective energy available during any stage of stellar evolution , than during the proto - neutron star phase .",
    "another option is what one might call the strong fossil field hypothesis : the magnetic field in the star reflects the magnetic field of the cloud from which the star was formed .",
    "ironically , stellar evolution models indicate that progenitors with a high magnetic field in the core end up producing more slowly rotating pulsars @xcite .",
    "this is a result of the more effective coupling of angular momentum of the core to the star s outer radius , where angular momentum is lost due to stellar winds .",
    "the results presented here are in agreement with the fossil field hypothesis .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that the magnetic flux distribution of magnetic white dwarfs and neutron stars are similar . translated to neutron star radii ,",
    "the highest magnetic field measured in white dwarfs correspond to @xmath64-@xmath65  g. however , this falls still short of the @xmath66  g needed to power flares from sgrs such as sgr 1806 - 20 .",
    "possibly this could be accounted for by additional magnetic field amplification during the late stages of stellar evolution of stars that end in a core collapse ( c.f .",
    "the core magnetic field evolution of the magnetic star of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand , the energetics of the snrs with magnetars",
    "could still be reconciled with magnetic field amplification in a rapidly rotating proto - neutron star , provided the angular momentum is not lost by magnetic braking , in which case it powers the supernova , but due to gravitational radiation or due to emission in a jet ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "such a loss mechanism should work on a time scale shorter than the magnetic braking time scale , i.e. less than a few hundred seconds .",
    "@xcite argued recently that if _ internal _ magnetic fields exceed @xmath67  g neutron stars deformation is sufficiently strong to cause gravitational waves that radiate away most of the rotational energy .",
    "note , however , that this is only true if rotation losses due gravitational waves exceed losses due to magnetic braking .",
    "this requires @xmath68  g , for which no conclusive evidence exists yet , whereas the external dipole field has to be low , @xmath69  g. moreover , this estimate is based on magnetic braking in vacuum , whereas during the first few seconds magnetic braking is likely to be enhanced due to the presence of hot plasma surrounding the proto - neutron star @xcite .",
    "it is possible that in the early phase of a magnetar the dipole field is indeed low . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed dipole fields are lower than is required to slow down to the spin periods of axps and sgrs .",
    "a case in point is 1e1841 - 045/kes73 , for which we determined an age of @xmath70  yr . to bring it from a period of few millisecond to its current period ( 11.8 s ) a dipole field",
    "is required of @xmath71  g for a braking index of @xmath72 .",
    "gravitational waves can not explain this , since only for very short periods do gravitational wave losses dominates over magnetic braking , because rotation loss scales with @xmath73 for gravitational waves and with @xmath74 for magnetic braking .",
    "another consequence is that as soon as magnetic braking dominates one expects the creation of a strong a pulsar wind nebula .",
    "intriguingly , none of the magnetars studied here shows any evidence for a pulsar wind component .",
    "the radio map of kes 73 shows , in fact , that the axp is located in a hole in the snr @xcite . in x - rays we do not expect to see a pulsar wind nebula , as the ultra - relativistic electrons responsible for x - ray synchrotron emission will have lost most of their energy . note",
    "that the spin - down of a magnetar like 1e1841 - 045 is so rapid that the pulsar wind nebula must evolve during the early , free expansion phase of the snr . since most of the ejecta has not been shocked it is possible that the relativistic particles freely escape instead of being confined by the hot plasma of the snr .",
    "however , it would be of great importance to investigate the formation of pulsar wind nebulae from magnetars in more detail , as it may provide additional means of determining whether axp / sgrs started with periods in the milli - second range .    finally , another way of losing angular momentum is by means of a jet during the explosion .",
    "radio and x - ray maps of kes 73 and n49 do not show evidence that a jet may have been present in the past .",
    "kes 73 is in fact remarkably circular symmetric ( fig .",
    "[ fig - spectra ] ) .",
    "interestingly , however , there is considerable evidence for a jet in the snr cas a @xcite , and there is indeed evidence , although not conclusive , that the point source in cas a is a magnetar @xcite .",

    "other differences between the models in fact go back to this , because fitting the sedov model with the abundances fixed at solar values we obtained a total emission measure and temperature closer to that of the 2nei model .",
    "the matter is of some interest , as overabundances would be an indication that kes 73 is in an early evolutionary state that can not be well described by a sedov model .",
    "another possible indication for that is the low total mass of kes 73 ( 2533 @xmath14 , for resp .",
    "the 2nei and sedov model ) , much lower than n49 ( 320 @xmath14 ) or ctb 109 ( @xmath24 @xmath14 , * ? ? ?",
    "we consider the 2 nei model to be more reliable in this case , since spex  incorporates more line data relevant for nei plasmas .",
    "in fact , fig .  [ fig - spectra ]",
    "shows that the fe - k complex around 6.6  kev and the mg xii lines around 1.4 kev are not well fitted .",
    "the spex  2nei model does not have these problems .",
    "although , the fits to the spectra of kes 73 and n49 are not perfect , the global features of the spectra are well fitted ( fig .",
    "[ fig - spectra ] ) .    nevertheless , we tried to constrain the explosion energy of kes 73 further by exploring the more generic snr evolution models of @xcite .",
    "we tried to answer the question , which explosion energies are still consistent with the densities and post - shock temperatures found from our fit , 24  @xmath13 and @xmath130  kev , given the shock radius of 4  pc and assuming that the ejecta masses lie in the range 0.5 - 25  @xmath14 .",
    "considering ejecta density profiles with power indices of @xmath131 , and @xmath132 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it turns out that the observational data is only consistent with energies in the range @xmath133  erg ."
