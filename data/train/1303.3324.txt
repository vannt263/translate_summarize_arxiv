    "_ successfully prepared a bulk superconducting lanibn  sample with @xmath0 = 4.1 k , using a technique involving a high temperature of 1200 @xmath14c and a high pressure of 5 gpa.@xcite two isostructural superconducting compounds , laptbn  and canibn , were also synthesized with @xmath0 = 6.7 and 2.2 k , respectively.@xcite    these boronitrides show some distinctions as well as similarities in crystal structure compared to fe pnictides .",
    "these systems commonly have inverse @xmath15-pbo - type @xmath16-b layers , but in the @xmath11 boronitrides @xmath16-b layers are separated by two lan layers with a width of 2.5 ( @xmath17 )  , as displayed in fig .",
    "as will be addressed below , boronitrides have metallic ( lan)@xmath18 intervening layers , while a superconducting fe pnictide , lafeaso , possesses insulating ( lao)@xmath19 intervening layers .    in the ni - based borocarbides , which are isostructural with boronitrides ,",
    "the interplay between superconductivity and magnetic fluctuation has been extensively discussed.@xcite pt - based superconductors often show unconventional superconductivity due to large spin - orbital coupling ( soc ) , incipient magnetism , and multigap nature.@xcite superconducting cept@xmath13si and li@xmath7pt@xmath13b , which do not have inversion symmetry , show significant soc , possibly leading to the exotic superconductivity.@xcite on the other hand , the effects of soc in superconducting srpt@xmath13p are negligible.@xcite so it is of interest to clarify whether the effects of soc or magnetism matter in lanibn  and laptbn . however , except for the observation of superconductivity , other data in the literature are still very limited .    in this paper",
    ", we will address the electronic structures , including fermiology , which indicate no magnetic instability and negligible soc effects in both superconducting boronitrides .",
    "then , the phonon spectra and the electron - phonon coupling ( epc ) will be discussed to unveil the mechanism of the superconductivity .",
    "in the tetragonal structure of la@xmath16bn(space group : @xmath20 , no . 129 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ str ] , the @xmath6 atoms lie on the @xmath21 sites ( @xmath22,@xmath23,@xmath24 ) , while the other atoms sit at the @xmath25 sites ( @xmath22,@xmath22,@xmath26 ) .",
    "our calculations were carried out with the experimental lattice constants : @xmath27 = 3.73    and @xmath28 = 7.64    for lanibn  and @xmath27 = 3.8240    and @xmath28 = 7.8649    for laptbn.@xcite these values lead to an 8% larger volume in laptbn , consistent with the larger atomic radius of pt .",
    "the internal parameters @xmath26 were optimized using an accurate all - electron full - potential code ( fplo)@xcite because of the inaccuracy of the initial experimental data in lanibn   discussed earlier@xcite and the lack of available data for laptbn .",
    "the optimized values show tiny differences of at most 0.02    between the local - density approximation ( lda ) and the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) generalized gradient approximation ( gga),@xcite indicating that these values are nearly independent of the exchange - correlation functional . in lanibn ,",
    "the optimized values @xmath26 are 0.1770 for la , 0.3545 for b , and 0.1636 for n. the corresponding @xmath26 values of laptbn  are 0.1666 for la , 0.3366 for b , and 0.1527 for n. the differences in @xmath26 between the experimental and our relaxed values are substantial , 0.65    for b and 0.13    for n,@xcite but they are consistent with the relaxed values by singh and pickett for la@xmath13ni@xmath7b@xmath7n,@xcite showing differences of 0.45    for b and 0.10    for n. using our optimized values , the b - n bond lengths of 1.45 ( @xmath29 )    are obtained for both systems , which are in agreement with the optimized values in the pseudopotenial code castep by imamura _",
    "et al._,@xcite whereas the @xmath16-b bond length is 6% longer in laptbn .",
    "these indicate that our optimized values are well converged .",
    "in addition , by reducing the volume by 5% , the b - n bond length remains unchanged , implying strong b - n bonding and stiffness of the lattice ( see below ) .",
    "the structural parameters were optimized until forces were smaller than 1 mev /  .    for the full phonon calculations",
    ", we used the linear response method within the gga implemented in the quantum espresso package,@xcite which produces optimized internal parameters very close to those of fplo .",
    "our phonon calculations were carried out with the pbe ultrasoft pseudopotentials , a gaussian smearing factor of 0.05 ry , a wave - function cutoff of 40 ry , and a charge cutoff of 400 ry .",
    "we used a @xmath30 @xmath31 mesh and a @xmath32 @xmath33 mesh for the phonon calculations and a @xmath34 @xmath31 mesh for the epc calculations , which require more careful treatment of the fermi energy @xmath35 .",
    "first , we address whether a magnetic instability is feasible in these boronitrides . fig . [ dos ] shows the total and atom - projected densities of states ( doss ) for both systems .",
    "doss at @xmath35 , @xmath36 , are seen to be rather low , 1.65 and 1.17 ( in units of states per ev per formula unit ) , which is consistent with the bad metallic character observed in their normal states .",
    "these values lead to bare specific - heat coefficients of 3.9 and 2.8 mj / mol - k@xmath37 for lanibn   and laptbn , respectively , which are approximately a quarter of that of fe pnictides in the nonmagnetic state .",
    "in contrast to the fe pnictides , this implies less magnetic instability , or lack of magnetic instability , in these boronitrides . additionally , the contribution of ni to @xmath36 is small , 0.33 states / ev - spin - f.u . for lanibn .",
    "the contribution of pt in laptbn   is only half of this value . using a typical intra - atomic exchange parameter of ni @xmath38 1 ev,@xcite the stoner factor @xmath39",
    "is estimated to be 0.33 for lanibn , which is much smaller than unity .",
    "so neither metamagnetism nor a near - stable ferromagnetic state is indicated .",
    "this feature is confirmed also by our fixed spin moment calculations in both systems ( not shown here ) .",
    "again , no stable ( anti)ferromagnetic states can be obtained from our calculations of both the local spin - density approximation and gga for both systems .",
    "interestingly , considering a partial contribution of each atom at @xmath35 , @xmath36 of la@xmath13ni@xmath7b@xmath7n@xmath13 can be exactly reproduced from that of lanibn .",
    "this may imply a common mechanism of the superconductivity in both systems .",
    "note that la@xmath13ni@xmath7b@xmath7n@xmath13 has higher @xmath0 by a factor of 3 and larger dos at @xmath35 in the unit cell by a factor of @xmath40 than lanibn.@xcite      now , we will focus on the nonmagnetic states , which represent the superconducting state .",
    "for lanibn , as shown in the dos in fig .",
    "[ dos](a ) , ni @xmath41 states mainly lie in the range of 3.5 to 1 ev .",
    "below that regime , two separated manifolds have nearly equally mixed characters of b , n , and ni ions but relatively small la character . near @xmath35 ,",
    "the characters of all atoms appear , indicating metallicity in both nib and lan layers , as observed in la@xmath13ni@xmath7b@xmath7n@xmath13.@xcite the fermi energy pinpoints the midway of two small peaks , resulting from the dispersionless bands with the mixed ni @xmath42 and @xmath43 characters along the @xmath44-@xmath45 line at 0.5 ev and along the @xmath46@xmath47 line at 50 mev , as displayed in fig .",

    "near @xmath35 , a mixture of these partially filled orbitals appears , reflecting strong hybridization between inter- and intra layers .",

    "the total and atom - projected doss of the @xmath49 counterpart laptbn   are given in fig .",
    "[ dos](b ) .",
    "as expected , the main part of pt @xmath49 orbitals is more widely spread over the range of 7.5 to 2 ev , but some tail extends to 2 ev .",
    "the total dos smoothly increases near @xmath35 , except for a van hove singularity at 80 mev , suggesting less sensitivity to carrier doping or moderate pressure . the corresponding band structure and fat bands of the partially filled orbitals are plotted together in fig . [ pt_band ] .",
    "a comparison with those of lanibn   shows some distinctions in several regimes , in particular , around the @xmath44 point and along the @xmath45-@xmath47 and the @xmath46-@xmath47 lines . at the @xmath44 point",
    "degenerate bands of b and n @xmath50 orbitals move below @xmath35 . to compensate for this ,",
    "the two fold degenerate flat bands with pt @xmath51 and @xmath52 orbital character shift up , being unfilled at the @xmath44 and @xmath46 points .",
    "these bands are reflected as small peaks at 0.3 and 1 ev in the dos in fig .",
    "[ dos](b ) .",
    "a more pronounced feature is the flat pt @xmath51 band lying at 40 mev along the @xmath45-@xmath47 line , while the corresponding ni band exists at 1 ev in lanibn .",
    "this leads to some differences in the phonon spectra , which will be addressed below .",
    "these distinctions are also analyzed through interpretation of the occupation matrix , which is useful for understanding the oxidation state.@xcite in lanibn , each orbital occupancy of ni @xmath41 is almost identical to 0.84@xmath53 per spin , resulting in a total of 8.42@xmath53 .",
    "b @xmath50 orbitals have 1.32@xmath53 in total . as observed in the fat bands in fig .",
    "[ pt_band ] , in laptbn   pt @xmath51 and @xmath52 orbitals are less filled by @xmath40.04@xmath53 , while the occupancy of pt @xmath48 increases a little .",
    "compared with lanibn , 0.2@xmath53 transfers from the pt ion to the b @xmath50 ion , whereas the occupancies of n @xmath50 and la @xmath49 remain unchanged .",
    "so the pt ions and the b ions are closer to nominal values of pt@xmath54 and b@xmath55 than the ni and b ions in lanibn , indicating less covalent bonding between the pt and b ions .",
    "( of course , the formal charge concept is murky due to the metallicity and strong hybridization in these systems . )",
    "this may be consistent with the longer pt - b bond length . according to our calculations , however , the occupancies of laptbn   are nearly unchanged even for the same structure as in lanibn , indicating that these distinctions are mainly due to chemical differences between pt and ni ions rather than differences in structure .    since @xmath49 systems often show substantial soc effects , lda + soc calculations were performed for laptbn . as displayed in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ pt_band ] , however , a comparison of the band structures between lda and lda + soc shows negligible soc effects near @xmath35 , except for a small difference at the @xmath47 point .",
    "this is due to the wide width of the pt @xmath49 band .",
    "additionally , our calculations substantiated that the epc strength and , consequently , @xmath0 remain nearly unchanged , when including soc . as a result ,",
    "the effects of soc on the superconductivity of laptbn   are insignificant .",
    "now , we will exclude the soc effects .",

    "the @xmath45-centered cylindrical fs , having mostly pt @xmath52 and la @xmath48 characters with small n @xmath50 character , becomes more two - dimensional .",

    "<S> further , we have found an interesting trend of monotonic increase of @xmath0 with respect to the boron height in the nib ( ptb ) layer of both borocarbide and boronitride superconductors , which suggests a possible way to enhance @xmath0 in these systems . </S>"
