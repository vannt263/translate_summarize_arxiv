    "* ) , classified into several subtypes depending on evidence of a strong magnetic field on the white dwarf ( wd ) , and on spectral and photometric characteristics ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we will focus on the vy scl - type nova - likes or ` anti - dwarf ' novae characterized by the presence of occasional dips on the light curve , so - called low states , defined by @xcite as a fading of the optical light by more than 1.5 mag in less than 150 days .",
    "the drop in luminosity can reach 7 mag and may last from weeks to years .",
    "the large optical and uv luminosity seems to imply that the vy scl - type nova - like , in their longer lasting optically high state , are undergoing mass transfer onto the wd at the high rate @xmath0 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 , sustaining an accretion disk in a stable hot state in which dn outbursts are suppressed ( see e.g. the disk thermal instability model of * ? ? ?",
    "the low states have been attributed to a sudden drop of @xmath3 from the secondary , or even to a total cessation of mass transfer ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the reason of this dramatic decrease of @xmath3 is still unclear .",
    "the most probable cause may be spots on the surface of the secondary , covering the l1 point and causing the mass - transfer cut off @xcite .",
    "@xcite have suggested instead non - equilibrium effects in the irradiated atmosphere of the donor .    if the transition from the high to low state occurs because of a decrease in @xmath3 , the accretion disks in these systems should move from the equilibrium region to the one of dwarf novae ( dn ) instabilities , so we should observe ( dn ) outbursts with recurrence times of 12 to 20 days during the low state , caused by thermal  viscous instabilities in the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "however , outbursts in the low state of these objects are extremely rare ( see * ? ? ? * for mv lyr ) .",
    "dn outbursts must be suppressed during the low state despite the low @xmath4 ; this can be explained by a wd effective temperature high enough ( 30,00050,000 k ) to irradiate the inner accretion disk and maintain it in the stable ` hot ' state @xcite , while the incoming mass accretion stream stops or decreases @xcite .",
    "the wd in the known dn never reaches this temperature range , but high wd effective temperatures have indeed been inferred via spectroscopic observations in the _ uv _ and _ fuv _ ranges for the vy scl objects ( see table 1 ) .",
    "@xcite suggested instead that the dn outbursts are prevented by the periodic disruption of the disc by a magnetic field of the wd , and in this model the vy scl would be intermediate polars ( ip ) , in which the wd magnetic field is of the order of 10@xmath5 gauss .",
    "@xcite proposed a link between the vy scl - type stars and super soft x - ray sources ( sss ) based on a _ rosat _ observations of v751 cyg .",
    "they found an anti - correlation in the optical and x - ray intensity , and despite the very poor spectral resolution of the _ rosat _ hri , the spectrum appeared to be soft in the low state .",
    "the authors suggested that quasi - stable thermonuclear burning occurs on the surface of the wd in the low state , preventing dn outbursts . in this framework , vy scl stars are key objects in the evolution of interacting wd binaries , in which hydrogen burning occurs periodically without outbursts .",
    "accretion goes on at a very high rate without ever triggering a thermonuclear runaway , because of the recurrent interruptions of the high @xmath3 regime .",
    "thus there is a possibility that vy scl stars reach the chandrasekhar mass and the conditions for type ia supernovae outbursts . @xcite and @xcite suggested also thermonuclear burning in the low states of v sge and bz cam .",
    "however , these two objects had not been actually observed as sss ; in more recent years an x - ray observation of the vy scl system v504 cyg in the low state failed to reveal a luminous sss @xcite .    using archival x - ray observations , in this paper we compare high and low state x - ray data , and some new _ uv _ data , for four vy scl - type stars .",
    "we seek clues to the complex evolution of these systems , and explanations for the changes that take place during the transition from the high to low state .",
    "in table 1 we report parameters from the published results of observations in the optical , near ( _ nuv _ ) and far ( _ fuv _ ) ultraviolet wavelength ranges .",
    "we see that these objects have an orbital period just above the period gap , in a narrow range between 3.2 and 3.7 hours . for the three systems mv lyr ,",
    "tt ari and v794 aql the wd effective temperature t@xmath6 was estimated in previous low states ( not shown in fig .",
    "1 ) from _ uv _ and _ fuv _ observations , in the range between 39,000 k and 47,000 k. these systems could not have been sss at the time of those observations , because t@xmath6 places the flux peak in the _ fuv _ range . on the other hand , we can not rule out ignition of thermonuclear burning , neither the possibility that the wd may become hotter with time in subsequent low states .",
    "the low state t@xmath6 of mv lyr tabulated in tab .",
    "1 was measured while the _ fuv _ flux , corresponding to most of the bolometric one , was about 3.6 @xmath7 erg s@xmath2 ( see table 1 ) . in fig .",
    "5 of @xcite we see that at the tabulated distance these values may be consistent with thermonuclear burning with @xmath8 m@xmath9 yr@xmath2 and a wd mass less than 1 m@xmath9 .",
    "@xcite suggested that mv lyr becomes hotter in the high state , hypothesizing a lower limit t@xmath10 k , consistent with a measured _ fuv _ flux of 2.5 @xmath11 erg s@xmath2 in the high state .",
    "if the wd really becomes hotter while emitting x - rays at this level , the possibility of thermonuclear burning would be even more likely in the high state . for a wd mass of 0.7 m@xmath9 and the value of @xmath4 in table 1 , assuming that the extreme _ uv _ ( _ euv _ ) luminosity is close to the total ( bolometric ) luminosity , nuclear burning according to @xcite occurs with t@xmath12 k ( see their fig .",
    "5 ) , which implies a peak luminosity in the _ euv _ range and no detectable sss .",

    "we consulted @xcite , who explored the dependence of these ratios on electron density and plasma temperature .",
    "the authors assumed a photoionezed plasma , with or without additional collisional ionization .",
    "we see from their figure 8 that the r ratios we obtained corresponds to high density ; we obtain a lower limit on the electron density n@xmath86 @xmath87 , @xmath88 @xmath87 and @xmath89 @xmath87 for ne , mg and si , respectively . however , it is known that the r ratios appears smaller , as if the density was higher than its actual value , when there is also photoexcitation by a strong _ uv_/_euv _ source , exciting the @xmath90 level electrons into the @xmath91 level @xcite .",

    "a fit with a plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium is not acceptable because of too high @xmath95 , but adding a second temperature we obtained a more reasonable fit , with @xmath95=1.2 .",
    "we adopted two bvapec models in xspec , which describe the emission spectrum of collisionally ionized diffuse gas , calculated using the atomdb code v2.0.1 with variable abundances at different temperature ( see table 4 and fig .",

    "we note that , if these two regions are related to accretion , for an electron density of order of 10@xmath105 @xmath87 ( the minimum electron density derived from the g ratio for si ) , the linear dimension of the emission region is of order of 3.1 @xmath106 cm and 7.1 @xmath106 cm , respectively .",
    "this is , of course , an purely phenomelogical model ; two large and distinct regions with different plasma temperature are difficult to explain in a physically realistic way .",
    "bvapec model performs the gaussian fitting of the lines and gives the @xmath107 for two systems of lines associated with the two components ( see table 4 ) .",
    "the full width at half maximum that corresponds to these values of @xmath107 is about 1100 and 1500 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we also wanted to try and better understand the physical scenario by adopting a more physically realistic model . @xcite",
    "have shown that accretion in all non magnetic cvs , and often even in magnetic ones , is best described by a stationary cooling flow model .",
    "we thus used the cooling flow vmcflow model in xspec ( a cooling flow model after * ? ? ?",
    "we see however that this fit yields a larger @xmath95 value than the previous simplified model , and this is mainly because there is more flux in the he - like lines than predicted by the model",
    ". this may be due to additional photoionization , for instance in a wind from the system , implying that not all the x - ray flux is produced in the accretion flow .",
    "the main problem , however , is that the cooling flow model includes the mass accretion rate @xmath4 as a parameter , but predicts a very low value for @xmath4 , only @xmath108 m@xmath9 yr@xmath2 , while the uv and optical observations indicate @xmath109 m@xmath9 yr@xmath2 for the high state @xmath4 ( see table 1 ) .",

    "these variations were associated with the changes in the amount of irradiation of the accretion disc ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "all the x - ray spectra of the vy scl systems we examined appear complex , and the _ chandra _ and _ suzaku _ spectra of tt ari clearly indicate more than one emission region or mechanism .",

    "the x - ray flux seemed to be anti - correlatd with the optical and uv only in bz cam .",
    "thus , if in the other three systems the main source of _ uv_/_fuv _ and optical luminosity is the accretion disk , it seems unlikely that the x - ray flux is due to the innermost portion of the disk .",
    "in fact , our fits with the cooling flow model , which generally yields good results assuming that all the x - ray flux is emitted in an accretion flow , for all four objects return unreasonably low values of @xmath3 , which can not be reconciled with measurements at other wavelengths . this is not completely unexpected , since the accretion disks of systems accreting at high @xmath4 , close to 10@xmath245 m@xmath9 yr@xmath2 , seem to re - radiate mostly or completely in the _ euv _ range @xcite , because the boundary layer is optically thick .    for tt ari , the semi - regular variability ( qpo ) with periods of 1726 minutes in the high state",
    "is best explained with the flickering of an accretion disk , however we also found that there is no correlation between the x - ray flux and the frequency of the qpo , which would be expected for accretion disk flickering ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "if the origin of the x - ray emission is not in the boundary layer of the accretion disk , it may originate in a wind , either from the wd or from the accretion disk , depleting matter from the system .",
    "such a wind may play an important role in the evolution , preventing the wd from reaching the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "the fit of the tt ari emission lines observed with _",
    "chandra _ indicates a fwhm in the range 11001500 km s@xmath2 .",
    "however , the lines do not display any measurable blue or red shift to prove a wind scenario .",
    "there is significant broadening , but it may be due to collisional ionization in the accretion flow , or to matter in almost - keplerian rotation .",
    "the wd effective temperature and _ fuv _ flux reported in table 1 are consistent with a line driven wind , although if nuclear burning takes place , the radius of wd at some stage may increase , and we can not rule out that at some ( still not observed ) brief stage the wd reaches a luminosity where also electron scattering opacity starts playing a role ( a nova - like radiation pressure wind ) . in either case ,",
    "the most likely origin for the x - ray flux in the observations we examined is circumstellar material , shocked when it collides with a new outflow , possibly at a large distance from the wd .",
    "there may be circumstellar material left from the agb phase of primary or old remnant of a previous nova , or a previous ` thicker ' wind caused by enhanced luminosity due to nuclear burning , that has slowed down .",
    "a strong stellar wind is very likely to play a role in the extended bz cam nebula , which was initially classified as a planetary nebula .",
    "instead we would argue that for tt ari this explanation can not account for the largest portion of the x - ray flux , because this system shows a 6.4 kev reflection line , which indicates that a large fraction of x - rays ( at least x - rays above 7 kev ) must originate close to the white dwarf or to the disk .",
    "there is a secure observation of x - rays far away from the accretion disk in ux uma ( see @xcite ) , an eclipsing nova - like with a hard , absorbed , eclipsed x - ray component and a soft , unabsorbed , uneclipsed x - ray component .",
    "the soft x - rays in ux uma may indeed originate in a wind from the system .",
    "a fast wind is also known to occur in cal 87 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , another system that may be closely related to the vy scl - type stars .",
    "the x - rays and optical flux variations anticorrelate only in bz cam , so it is possible that in this system the wind increases in the low state , causing additional absorption and obscuring the accretion disk .",
    "disk winds are observed in many types of compact objects , while the mechanism that causes them is not completely clear . at optical and uv wavelengths",
    "a mass outflow from the disk has been inferred in some cv via the observation p cygni profiles , most notably the civ @xmath2461549   line ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "p cygni line profiles or / and absorption features have also been detected in x - rays in low mass x - ray binaries ( @xcite , @xcite ) and are assumed to originate in a high - velocity outflow from a flared and x - ray - heated accretion disk .",
    "disk winds also cause additional circumstellar , sometimes time - dependent , absorption components in the soft x - rays in non - magnetic cv s ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a tempting hypothesis is that , while one component of the x - ray flux is due to a mass outflow from the system , another component originates in a different , and coexistent mode of accretion other than the disk , i.e. a stream to the polar caps . in short ,",
    "the vy scl would be intermediate polars ( ip s ) .",
    "this scenario explains the lack of a clear correlation of _ uv_/optical versus x - ray flux variations . as in the model proposed by @xcite",
    "the stream to the polar caps still continue , at decreased rate , when the accretion disk is periodically disrupted in the optically low state . in an ip ,",
    "the disk would emit in optical and _ uv _ , but it would be truncated instead of having an x - ray emitting boundary layer , no matter what the value of @xmath4 is .",
    "mauche ( 2010 ) compared spectra of magnetic and non - magnetic cv s and made a point that division into the two classes is not clear - cut on the basis of the x - ray spectrum alone , because of the large variety of observed x - ray spectra of magnetic cv s .",
    "there is no ` typical ' spectrum among polars and ip s .",
    "there is evidence for and against the magnetic scenario for tt ari , but the x - ray spectrum alone does not prove or disprove it .",
    "an x - ray flux modulation due to the wd rotation period , which is very typical and is considerd the smoking gun to classify ip s , has not been detected in these systems so far . for",
    "three of them the reason may be low inclination , but not so for v794 aql .",
    "however , if the major component of the x - ray flux in the high state is not the accretion stream to the poles , but it is associated instead with a wind , isolating the accretion component for the timing analysis is a serious hurdle in detecting a periodicity due to the wd rotation .",
    "the vy scl binaries are critical to understand the evolution of wd interacting binaries .",
    "they pose several riddles for the theories and understanding them well is a key to a consistent evolutionary picture .",
    "are these systems almost always quietly accreting at a high rate , with short intervals of low @xmath4 that prevent the occurence of a thermonuclar flash and mass loss in nova outbursts ?",
    "is thermonuclear burning of hydrogen on - going at all phases , and how do we find evidence since we do not observe their wd at the high effective temperature necessary to emit supersoft x - rays ?",
    "we analyzed a number of x - rays and uv observations of four vy scl systems comparing phenomena occurring during the optically ` high ' and ` low ' state .",
    "we did not detect supersoft x - ray emission in both states , however , we can not exclude h burning at a lower temperature , outside of the sss window , as can be expected from the low masses of the white dwarfs in these systems .",
    "the data collected and examined in this paper suggest that the x - ray emission has more than one component in all the four systems .",
    "we concluded that one component most likely originates in the circumstellar material , shocked by the wind , possibly at a large distance from the wd while the second component can be x - ray emission from the polar caps .",
    "however , we are not able to prove neither clearly disprove an ip scenario for these systems .",
    "it can be argued that the x - ray observations at this stage have posed more new puzzles .",
    "we suggest that monitoring these systems over the years in optical , _ uv _ and x - rays as frequently and simultaneously as possible is a key to understand how accretion occurs and how it interplays with the thermal state of the secondary . more intensive monitoring , that may be done with",
    "_ swift _ , would be very rewarding , allowing to understand whether an evolutionary path at high mass transfer rate without mass loss in nova outbursts can be sustained for a long time , and whether it leads to ` quieter ' outflows preventing the wd growth in mass , or to evolution towards a type ia supernova .",
