    "the most common type of genetic variants in the human genome is the single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) , which , as a result of mutation , has a difference in a single nucleotide within a population of samples  @xcite .",
    "snp data , together with gene expression and other biological information , are an important resource to answer various biological questions regarding the genetic variation , such as the mutational pattern of the genome , the phylogenetic classification , and the association with phenotype data .    in recent years , as the cost of genotyping has dropped dramatically due mainly to the advance in the genotyping technology  @xcite , much effort has been put into the identification of snps in the human genome  @xcite .",
    "notably , the international hapmap project  @xcite ( hereafter , hapmap ) is an international effort to identify the genetic variation in the human genome to develop a haplotype map .",
    "although hapmap includes some datasets on the copy number variation , snp data are the main resource not only for understanding and characterizing the differences in genome structure but for association studies with diseases and/or environmental factors .",
    "it has been known that snps in the human genome are not distributed randomly but clustered across the genome  @xcite .",
    "this clustering property suggests that mutations tend to occur not randomly but preferentially to the proximity of existing mutations .",
    "in addition to the interpretation of the clustering as the reflection of mutational hotspots  @xcite , clustered snps can emerge in various ways .",
    "natural and balancing selections can modulate local variability and tend to create regions of increased variability that results in non - randomness  @xcite . a high variance of genes within a population of samples in the time to the most recent common ancestor causes different recombination rates in a chromosome  @xcite .",
    "it was also proposed that microsatellites can also generate mutational biases in their flanking regions by expansion and erosion from the perspective of microsatellite evolution  @xcite .",
    "clustered snps can also arise from ascertainment biases in the snp discovery process  @xcite .",
    "examples include the snp identification based on maximally dissimilar sequences , the usage of not enough samples , and finding all possible snps not on a whole genome but on a given region of a chromosome .    however , when snp clusters are found throughout a whole genome with a large number of samples from different global populations , it is unlikely that the observed clusters would be due to ascertainment biases .",
    "thus , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the majority of snp markers along a whole genome should reflect the underlying mutation pattern . in this respect ,",
    "a non - random mutation process was proposed and tested against the random mutation by generating a semi - realistic population of chromosomes from stochastic computer simulations that implements the concept of ` the sphere of influence '  @xcite . as millions of snps on a whole genome are now available in public domains , the mutation pattern can be systematically investigated .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a probabilistic model for the clustered distribution of snps .",
    "the proposed model assumes non - independent mutations in which subsequent mutations occur not randomly but preferentially to near mutated sites . within the model",
    ", snp clusters could form mainly through a non - negligible tendency of the mutation process in the closer proximity of existing snps .",
    "the proposed model was tested against hapmap snp data and the proposed model was confirmed as suitable to explain empirical snp distributions of the human genome",
    ". we also tested the proposed model against the random mutation model in which all mutations occur independently , and we confirm that the proposed model explains the distribution more appropriately than the random model .    as",
    "the x chromosome is a haploid in males , its snp distribution may have characteristics different from the distributions of the autosomes . with the estimated parameters in the proposed model , we characterized the clustered snp distributions obtained from different chromosomes , including the x chromosome .",
    "whereas the proposed model is valid irrespective of the ploidy ( i.e. , either diploid or haploid ) , our analysis of estimated parameters accounts for the characteristics , such as the pronounced population structure and the low mutation rate , specific to the x chromosome .",
    "we use the genome - wide hapmap snp data of phase iii , which consists of 1,440,616 snps in 1184 reference individuals from 11 global ancestry groups of three continental regions .",
    "the data are publicly available and can be downloaded at http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. to investigate the population - specific differences , we extracted snps that are polymorphic within each of a single population .",
    "for each of 11 global populations , we analyzed snp distributions on 22 autosomes and the x chromosome .",
    "generally , the number of snps depends on the number of samples , the chromosome , and the genetic diversity of the population .",
    "thus , the number of identified snps may fluctuate with populations and chromosomes .",
    "table [ sstat ] shows the number of snps identified in each population summed over all chromosomes and each chromosome averaged over 11 global populations .",
    "the number of snps for each population in table [ sstat ] roughly illustrates the regional difference in the genetic diversity .",
    "the populations that originated from africa ( asw , lwk , mkk , yri ) have a larger number of snps than other continental regions , indicating a higher genetic diversity .",
    "on the other hand , the population from asia ( chb , chd , jpt ) have a smaller number of snps and a lower genetic diversity than others .",
    ".the number @xmath0 of snps in each of single population ( left two columns ) and in each chromosome averaged over 11 populations ( right four columns ) .",
    "the population names are abbreviated and the full names can be found in ref .",
    "note that the number of snps in each single population and the total number of snps of all chromosomes are less than 1,440,616 snps obtained from all global populations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ sstat ]    the clustering property of snps can be represented by taking the ordered locations of all snps and examining how proximate they are located .",
    "we quantify the proximity of snps in terms of the snp space , which is defined as the number of nucleotides between two adjacent snps in their ordered locations .",
    "specifically , let @xmath1 be the location , in the number of nucleotides counting from @xmath2 of a sequence , of the @xmath3th snp in a chromosome .",
    "then , the @xmath3th snp space @xmath4 is defined as @xmath5          an snp is the result of a mutation and it is commonly assumed that the mutation arises randomly in dna sequence . under this assumption , we tested the hypothesis that snps are distributed randomly in a sequence . in the random mutation model , mutations occur independently of each other with a constant probability @xmath6 of @xmath7 . with the random model , the probability distribution of the snp space defined in eq .",
    "( [ def ] ) can be derived as follows .",
    "suppose that an snp is found at the location @xmath8 .",
    "then , the probability of finding a subsequent snp at the location @xmath9 is given as @xmath10 note that eq .",
    "( [ pd ] ) is the probability mass function of a geometric distribution  @xcite .",
    "the geometric distribution is the discrete analogue of the exponential distribution and has a property of being memoryless . the distribution is often used for modeling the number of trials until the first success , in our case , an snp .    by taking a logarithm on the both sides of eq .",
    "( [ pd ] ) , we get @xmath11 this illustrates that @xmath12 is linear in @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the proportionality , or a slope",
    ". the parameter @xmath6 can be estimated , for example , by the maximum likelihood estimation ( mle ) .",
    "thus , if mutations occur randomly , we expect that @xmath12 should be a straight line in @xmath13 with a negative slope of @xmath15 .    in fig .",
    "[ fdist ] , we plot the empirical distribution of the snp spacing @xmath13 for different chromosomes of asw .",
    "a comparison with the random model reveals that the empirical distributions do not follow a geometric distribution ( the dotted line ) , especially for small values of @xmath13 in which the major deficiency of the model occurs .",
    "in particular , fig .",
    "[ fdist ] shows that the probability increases sharply and non - linearly as @xmath13 becomes small which suggests that the snps are clustered .",
    "this tendency of the distribution is more or less independent of the chromosome .",
    "this reflects that snps are distributed not randomly , but clustered . from these",
    "we can infer that the random mutation hypothesis is inadequate to explain the clustering property of snps .",
    "the clustered snps imply that when a mutation occurs , another mutation is more likely to occur as they are closer in their locations .",
    "this suggests that the mutation probability is not independent of the location but dependent on how close the mutations are in their locations .",
    "this non - independent mutation can be modeled after the mutation probability being inversely proportional to some power of the separation in nucleotides between two consecutive mutations .",
    "formally , given that a mutation occurs at the location @xmath16 , the probability of the next mutation at @xmath17 can be expressed as @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the proposed model contains two parameters , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , to be estimated .",
    "the @xmath21 is the probability of two mutations occurring consecutively in genomic locations , and the @xmath22 is the strength of the mutational non - independence .",
    "the larger is @xmath22 , the smaller mutation probability as @xmath23 increases . in particular , when @xmath24 , the proposed model reduces to the random model of section [ rsec ] .",
    "it should be noted that the proposed model is a phenomenological model to account for the observed clustered snp distributions , rather than a model based on molecular mechanism .",
    "that is , the phenomenological model does not implement any biological mechanism of mutation , such as the heterozygote instability . rather , this model is based on the fact that if the mutation does not occur randomly , there must be some dependence on the snp space . with the proposed model , the probability of snp space @xmath13",
    "is given , for @xmath25 , as @xmath26 or , by taking a logarithm of eq .",
    "( [ pmodel ] ) , we have @xmath27 as the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ lmodel1 ] ) is intractable analytically and even computationally , we resort to an approximate expression .",
    "it is known that there is one snp in roughly every 1,000 base pairs .",
    "thus , we assume @xmath28 and expand @xmath29 around @xmath30 to the first order in @xmath21 to get @xmath31 using an integral approximation of @xmath32 and the stirling s formula of @xmath33 , eq .",

    "the distributions of the chromosomes 11 and x are shifted vertically for the display purpose , and the vertical axis is in a log scale . ]",
    "although the phenomenological model that we used in this study is much simpler and unrealistic than the heterozygote instability model , the phenomenological model is intractable mathematically unless we make approximations .",

    "the dotted lines represent linear fits with the least square error . ]    using hapmap snp data , we estimate two parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 for all chromosomes of each single population . with the estimated parameters , we present a few @xmath44 , together with the corresponding empirical distributions in fig .  [ model ] . as shown in fig .",
    "[ model ] , the model distribution fits well to the empirical distribution , especially to small @xmath13 of non - linearly increasing region representing clustered snps",
    ". moreover , fig .",
    "[ model ] demonstrates that the proposed model is equally applicable not only to the autosomes but to the x chromosome .",
    "we also see that the proposed model is more adequate than the random model ( dotted line in fig .  [ model ] ) .",
    "this result supports , at least partially if not entirely , the non - independent mutation hypothesis .",
    "as the x chromosome is haploid in males , it has smaller population size than the autosome has .",
    "thus , we may expect that the clustering property of snps on the x chromosome may differ from that on the autosomes  @xcite .",
    "a consequence of a smaller population size of the x chromosome is a low abundance in snps .",
    "it is known that the nucleotide mutation rate in females is much lower than in males  @xcite . the smaller population size and low mutation rate result in the genetic diversity of the x chromosome about a half of that of the autosomes  @xcite .",
    "thus , we expect that snps on the x chromosome to be about half abundance that of the autosomes  @xcite . from the clustering perspective",
    ", this implies that snps on the x chromosome are less clustered than those on the autosomes in the sense that the average of snp space @xmath13 over the x chromosome is larger than that over the autosomes .",
    "that is , larger @xmath13 is more probable on the x chromosome than on the autosomes .",
    "this characteristic can also be seen by the visual inspection of fig .",
    "[ model ] .    to measure the abundance in snps , we fit the empirical distribution of @xmath45 in terms of a linear function ( i.e. , the random model of eq .",
    "( [ null ] ) ) in @xmath13 so that the slope @xmath15 of the fitted function approximately quantify the degree of clusteredness .",
    "we estimated the slope for all chromosomes , and found that the slopes were in the range of @xmath46 $ ] for the autosomes and @xmath47 for the x chromosome .",
    "the fact that the slope for the x chromosome is less steep than that for the autosomes quantitatively supports the low abundance and fewer clusters of snps on the x chromosome .    based on the finding that the proposed model can explain the clustering property of snps",
    ", we further analyze the estimated parameters of the proposed model .",
    "figure [ all ] plots estimated @xmath22 versus @xmath21 using snp data on 23 chromosomes from each of 11 global populations . from fig .",
    "[ all ] , we see that the parameters for the x chromosome exhibits a larger variation across 11 global populations than those for the autosomes .",
    "being a haploid , the smaller population size of the x chromosome has a faster genetic drift than the autosomes .",
    "consequently , the population structure ( or population stratification ) of the x chromosome should be more pronounced than that of the autosomes  @xcite . given that the population structure implies the presence of a systematic difference in allelic frequencies between global populations , we expect that chromosomes having pronounced population structure should have higher dissimilarity in their allele between populations , which , in turn , induces higher variability in clustered snp distribution .",
    "thus , the comparatively large variation of the x chromosome across the populations is evidence of its pronounced population structure .",
    "we also clustered autosomes according to their estimated parameters of @xmath48 by using the k - means algorithm  @xcite with the number of clusters @xmath49 , suggested by the method for determining @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "the result of cluster analysis of 22 autosomes are shown in fig .  [ all ] .",
    "the cluster analysis result demonstrates that chromosomes in the same cluster ( for instance , chromosomes 9 and 16 in @xmath51 ) have similar degree of clustered snps in terms of their probability distribution of the snp space .    from the finding that @xmath52 , we can further approximate eq .",
    "( [ prop1 ] ) to investigate the mutational non - independence . by expanding eq .",
    "( [ prop1 ] ) to the first order in @xmath22 , it can be approximated as @xmath53 one way to express the mutational non - independence part is the difference between logarithmic probabilities of eq .",

    "whereas , when @xmath60 , we have @xmath61 .",
    "this suggests that as @xmath13 becomes smaller , the non - random part increases , which is consistent with the results that can be found , for instance , in fig .",

    "we found that the estimated parameters have smaller variation across the chromosomes [ fig .",

    "[ a1 ] ( b ) ] .",
    "this implies that the clustering property depends more on the chromosome than on the population . in particular , among the variations across chromosomes , fig .",
    "[ a1 ] ( a ) shows that the chromosome x has higher variability than the autosomes whose cause was discussed before .    aside from the deviations",

    "the mutation probability of eq .",
    "( [ alt ] ) increases ( or decreases ) as @xmath21 ( or @xmath22 ) increases .",
    "this implies that , when the parameters are positively correlated , the increase in @xmath21 is compensated for by the increase in @xmath22 , and vice - verse .",
    "thus , the positive correlation over autosomes demonstrates that the mutation probability stays more or less the same for all autosomes .    on the other hand ,",
    "the negative correlation over the global populations illustrates that the mutation rate depends on the estimated values of @xmath21 ( or @xmath22 ) of the population .",
    "that is , as @xmath21 increases , a negatively correlated @xmath22 decreases ; as a result , the mutation probability of eq .",
