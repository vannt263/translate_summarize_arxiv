    "they realized that the local matrices ( tensors ) decompose into a structural part given by the symmetry and a degeneracy part .",
    "the structural part consists of a clebsch - gordan coefficient , and the ( variational ) parameters of the model reside in the degeneracy part only .",
    "the number of parameters to be determined is therefore significantly reduced with respect to a non - symmetric theory .",

    "however , in addition to this basic implementation of symmetry into a tensor network with the purpose of reducing the number of independent parameters , it is possible to entirely eliminate the structural tensors and develop algorithms in terms of the degeneracy tensors only  @xcite .",
    "this reduces the requirements for computational resources significantly , and in turn enables significant improvements to the accuracy of the results that can be obtained .",
    "the elimination of structural tensors from the algorithms requires changes to standard ( non - symmetric ) tensor network implementations , e.g. via precomputation schemes as suggested in ref .",
