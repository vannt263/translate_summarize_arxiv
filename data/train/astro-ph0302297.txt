    "the first stars in the universe ( pop - iii ) formed out of metal - free gas , relic from the big bang .",
    "the bottom - up hierarchy of structure formation in cold dark matter ( cdm ) models implies that stars started to form in cdm halos just above the cosmological jeans mass of @xmath4 at redshifts as high as @xmath5 ( see review by barkana & loeb 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "simulations of metal - free star formation indicate that the first stars had high masses ( @xmath6 ) since gas cooling by molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath7 ) can not lower the gas temperature below @xmath1k ( bromm , coppi , & larson 2002 ; abel , bryan & norman 2002 ) .",
    "massive , metal - free stars shine at their eddington luminosity , @xmath8 , and have roughly constant effective ( surface ) temperatures of @xmath9k and lifetimes of @xmath10yr , independent of their mass ( bromm , kudritzki , & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "this implies that the number of ionizing photons produced per baryon incorporated into these stars ( @xmath11 ) was independent of their mass function , and larger by more than an order of magnitude than the yield of the observed pop - ii ( low - mass , metal - rich ) stars .",
    "_ did the first generation of metal - free stars produce a sufficient total number of ionizing photons to reionize the universe ? _",
    "this question is difficult to answer theoretically .",
    "the uv radiation from the massive stars can easily dissociate the fragile intergalactic h@xmath7 molecules which are responsible for star formation in mini - halos with virial temperatures @xmath12k ( haiman , rees , & loeb 1997 ; haiman , abel & rees  2000 ; ricotti et al .",
    "moreover they could evaporate the gas out of the shallow potential wells of the first cdm mini - halos ( barkana & loeb 1999 ; nishi & tashiro  2000 ) .",
    "finally the hydrodynamic energy released by a single supernova explosion is much larger than the gravitational binding energy of the gas in these halos ( barkana & loeb 2001 ) . if feedback quenches star formation in mini - halos , then pop - iii star formation will be dominated by more massive halos where h@xmath7 can form in dense gas shielded from the uv background ( oh & haiman  2002 ; mackey , bromm & hernquist  2002 ) .",
    "analysis of the first year data from the _ wmap _ satellite suggests a large optical depth to electron scattering @xmath13 , implying significant reionization at redshifts as high as @xmath14 ( kogut et al .",
    "2003 ; spergel et al .",
    "while this result is not surprising in view of earlier detailed calculations of the reionization history by metal - free stars ( wyithe & loeb 2003 ; paper i ) , it offers an intriguing _ empirical _ path for answering the aforementioned question . in this _ letter _ , we argue that metal - free stars are _ required _ by the _ wmap _ measurement of @xmath15 .",
    "we assume the most recent cosmological parameters obtained through fits to _ wmap _ data ( spergel et al .",
    "these include density parameters of @xmath16 in matter , @xmath17 in baryons , @xmath18 in a cosmological constant , a hubble constant of @xmath19 , an rms amplitude of @xmath20 for mass density fluctuations in a sphere of radius @xmath21mpc , and a primordial power - spectrum with a power - law index @xmath22 .",
    "any tilt in the power spectrum at the level that is marginally indicated by the combination of the _ wmap _ data with other data sets ( spergel et al .  2003 ) would reduce the small - scale power , delay reionization , and strengthen our conclusion .",
    "different reionization histories result in different large - scale polarization anisotropies of the microwave background ( zaldarriaga 1997 ; kaplinghat et al .",
    "a simple measure of the reionization history is the integrated optical depth to electron scattering @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the thomson cross - section and @xmath25 . the electron number density , @xmath26 , depends on the mass filling factors @xmath27 of the different ionized species in the gas , @xmath28,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 denotes the total present - day number densities of hydrogen ( h ) , and helium ( he ) .",
    "we now consider reionization histories under different model assumptions .",
    "the histories follow the reionization of hydrogen as well as the single and double reionization of helium in an inhomogeneous igm ( miralda - escude et al .",
    "we include helium in our calculations since the harder spectrum of massive pop - iii stars can reionize both hydrogen and helium at high redshift ( oh et al .",
    "2001 ; venkatesan , tumlinson & shull  2003 ) .",
    "we calculate the emissivity of quasars described by the luminosity function of wyithe & loeb ( 2002a ) as well as the emissivity of high redshift zero - metallicity stars and pop - ii stars ( the latter is discussed in   [ stars ] ) .",
    "our model has two free parameters : ( i ) the transition redshift , @xmath30 , at which pop - ii stars start to dominate the cosmic radiation field of ionizing photons ; and ( ii ) the product of the star formation efficiency in massive galaxies @xmath31 ( = stellar mass / total initial baryonic mass ) and the escape fraction @xmath32 of ionizing photons from galaxies . in paper",
    "i we presented contours of @xmath33 as a function of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we have found that if the star formation efficiency in early low - mass galaxies resembled that in local dwarf galaxies with the same circular velocity , then values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 lead to @xmath33 within the range measured by _",
    "wmap_. below we summarize the basic ingredients of our model ; more details can be found in paper i.    we treat the igm as a two - phase medium . in regions of reionized igm , star formation can only be initiated in halos that collapse above a virial temperature threshold of @xmath38k , corresponding to the cosmological jeans mass of photo - ionized igm at @xmath39k ( e.g. , thoul & weinberg  1996 ; kitayama & ikeuchi  2000 ) . in the neutral igm",
    ", star formation is limited to halos with virial temperatures above the minimum for efficient gas cooling .",
    "if only atomic hydrogen is present , then @xmath40k",
    ". however if molecular hydrogen is present then @xmath41k ( haiman , thoul , & loeb 1996 ; haiman , abel , & rees 2000 ) and star formation can proceed in much smaller halos .",
    "we begin by discussing the case with @xmath40k .      to compute the comoving densities of stellar ionizing photons ( @xmath42 ) we integrate over model spectra for stellar populations to find the total number of ionizing photons ( @xmath43 ) emitted per baryon incorporated into stars .",
    "we find @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the number density of baryons , and @xmath46 is the fraction of baryons in the universe at redshift @xmath47 that collapsed , cooled , and formed stars .    a recent analysis of sdss data ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2002 ) has shown that in a large sample of local galaxies , the ratio between the total stellar ( @xmath48 ) and dark matter halo ( @xmath49 ) masses scales as @xmath50 for @xmath51 , but is constant for larger stellar masses .",
    "thus the star formation efficiency within dwarf galaxies is proportional to @xmath50 . since star formation",
    "is thought to be regulated by supernova feedback ( dekel & silk 1986 ; dekel & woo 2002 ) , and the supernova energy output is proportional to @xmath48 while the gravitational binding energy scales as @xmath52 , more massive galaxies retain a larger fraction of their gas .",
    "using the stellar mass tully - fisher relation of bell & de jong  ( 2001 ) , we find the threshold circular velocity @xmath53 that corresponds to a stellar mass of @xmath54 at @xmath55 .",
    "the mass of a dark matter halo with circular velocity @xmath56 is @xmath57^{-3/2}m_\\odot$ ] .",
    "we define @xmath31 as the star formation efficiency in galaxies with circular velocities larger than @xmath56 ; below @xmath56 the star formation efficiency is @xmath58 . given @xmath59",
    "we find @xmath60 where @xmath61 for @xmath62 and @xmath63 for @xmath64 , @xmath65 is the mean comoving mass density of matter , and @xmath66 is the comoving number density of halos with masses @xmath67 ( sheth & thormen 1999 ) .",
    "finally , the value of @xmath68 in the two phase igm required for calculation of @xmath69 may then be computed from @xmath70      we begin with calculations of reionization histories in the absence of metal - free stars at all redshifts .",
    "we have calculated reionization histories for several values of @xmath35 in terms of the volume filling factor @xmath71 of ionized regions in the low overdensity ( @xmath72 ) igm ( miralda - escude et al . 2000 ; paper i ) , and computed the resulting values of @xmath33 .",
    "recently , theuns et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have argued that if hi reionization ended before @xmath73 , and the universe remained reionized after that , then adiabatic cooling would have lead to an igm temperature at @xmath74 , much lower than inferred from the ly@xmath3 forest . as a result , the most recent overlap of intergalactic hii regions must have occurred at @xmath75 , unless there was significant photo - heating at @xmath76 due to the double reionization of helium . in the absence of metal free stars we find that this constraint requires @xmath77 , resulting in a value of @xmath78 that is not consistent with the _ wmap _ data .",
    "on the other hand , if we neglect the constraint that hii overlap occurred at @xmath75 , we find that in the absence of metal - free stars , reionization histories resulting in @xmath79 imply hii overlap redshifts of @xmath80 .",
    "however assuming feedback regulation of star formation in low mass galaxies , these histories require the unphysical value of @xmath81 in galaxies with @xmath82 .",
    "we therefore conclude that reionization by an early population of massive metal - free stars ( with very large metal - free stars . the yield is larger by a factor of @xmath83 for pop - iii stars with masses @xmath84 ( bromm , kudritzki , & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "the use of the higher yield would have lead to the same @xmath33 for values of @xmath35 at @xmath85 that are smaller by a factor of 2 than we quote . ]",
    "@xmath86 ) must have contributed significantly to @xmath33 at @xmath87 .",
    "the formation of metal free stars is moderated with cosmic time by the gradual metal enrichment of the igm .",
    "it has been argued that the dominant mode of star formation change to pop - ii once the metallicity of the associated gas rises above @xmath88z@xmath89 ( schneider et al .",
    "2002 ; bromm et al .",
    "if all pop - iii stars formed in the mass range of @xmath90m@xmath91m@xmath89 where pair - unstable supernovae result in expulsion of metals into the surrounding gas ( heger & woosley  2001 ) , and if all metals were mixed uniformly throughout the entire igm , then pop - iii star formation would have ceased as soon as @xmath92 ionizing photons were produced per cosmic hydrogen atom ( ciardi , ferrara & white  2003 ) . however , the highly inhomogeneous nature of the enrichment process ( furlanetto & loeb 2003 ) and the formation of pop - iii stars beyond the above mass range , naturally lead to reionizion .",
    "_ must the pop - iii stars possess a heavy initial mass function ( imf ) ?",
    "_ tumlinson & shull  ( 2000 ) computed the ionizing photon output per baryon of zero - metallicity stars with a salpeter imf and found only a 50% increase over the values for metal enriched pop - ii stars with the same imf .",
    "this moderate increase is to be compared with the increase by more than an order of magnitude for the massive pop - iii stars described by bromm , kudritzki , & loeb ( 2001 ) ( the number of ionizing photons produced per baryon is nearly independent of stellar mass ) .",
    "the arguments presented above therefore imply that pop - iii stars were very massive rather than of a salpeter imf .",
    "this provides the first observational support to the results from hydrodynamic simulations of early star formation ( bromm et al .",
    "2002 ; abel et al . 2002 ) .",
    "in generating the star formation history we have extrapolated results from the local galaxy sample , assuming that feedback governs the observed stellar mass as a function of halo potential depth .",
    "however high redshift galaxies may have cooling times that are shorter than the dynamical time of their cold gas .",
    "this may lead to a starburst that might render the time - delayed supernovae feedback less effective .",
    "we now briefly consider this case .",
    "assuming the star formation efficiency to be independent of halo mass ( case a in paper i ) , we find that reasonable values of @xmath93 can yield @xmath94 in the absence of massive pop - iii stars .",
    "however , the corresponding reionization histories also have an early hii overlap . therefore , unless the global product of escape fraction and star formation efficiency was more than an order of magnitude larger at @xmath95 than at @xmath96 , our conclusion that an early generation of massive metal free stars is required to produce both @xmath94 and hii overlap at @xmath75 is independent of whether feedback regulates star formation in low mass galaxies or not .",
    "we now show that the joint constraints of @xmath97 and hii overlap at @xmath75 can be met simultaneously for values of @xmath98 and @xmath99 if massive metal - free stars were present at high redshifts . in figure  [ plot1 ]",
    "we show two cases of the evolution of @xmath71 for hydrogen ( solid lines ) , singly ionized helium ( dashed lines ) and doubly ionized helium ( dotted lines ) .",
    "we assume through fitting the near - infrared background .",

    "2001 ) at high redshift . in the former case",
    "there is a significant reionization but _ failed _ hii overlap at early times , followed by a recombination and a successful hii overlap at @xmath96 due to pop - ii stars .",
    "the two examples yield @xmath33 within one standard deviation and at the most likely value of _ wmap _ , respectively .",
    "note that our model leads to the double reionization of helium by quasars at @xmath106 independent of the contribution from pop - iii stars .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with current observational data [ e.g. theuns et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and references therein ] .",
    "the reionization of heiii by quasars is characterized by a sharp rise in our model , with @xmath107 increasing from @xmath108 at @xmath109 to @xmath110 at @xmath111 .",
    "we do not expect pre - heating from the reionization of heiii to impact on the conclusion that the most recent hii overlap took place at @xmath75 .",
    "figure  [ plot1 ] also shows the evolution of @xmath71 for hydrogen when helium is ignored ( light solid line ) . in these calculations all photons blueward of 13.6ev reionize hydrogen .",
    "we find that the additional ionizing photons result in overlap of hydrogen at an earlier epoch , but the net optical depth to electron scattering is decreased .",
    "so far we have assumed that atomic cooling dictates the mass of the smallest galaxies .",
    "however it has been suggested that significant production of x - rays could catalyze molecular hydrogen production allowing star formation in mini - halos before reionization ( haiman , rees , & loeb 1996 ; cen 2002 ) .",
    "the light dashed lines in the left hand panels of figure  [ plot1 ] show the evolution in @xmath71 for hydrogen ( in the absence  of helium ) assuming @xmath41k in the neutral igm .",
    "we find that the feedback - regulation built into the model sufficiently limits the star formation efficiency in mini - halos so that they do not contribute significantly to the reionization history .",

    "this conclusion holds if feedback regulates star formation in early low - mass galaxies as observed in present - day dwarf galaxies . without metal free stars , the condition that the most recent overlap of intergalactic hii regions must have occurred at @xmath2 ( theuns et al .",
    "2002 ) generically yields @xmath113 .",
    "the joint requirements that @xmath114 and that hii regions overlapped at @xmath75 imply that metal - free stars reionized a significant fraction of the igm at @xmath95 . moreover , we find that these stars must have been _ massive _ to provide the required order - of - magnitude increase in the production rate of ionizing photons relative to low mass pop - ii stars ( bromm , kudritzki & loeb  2001 ) .",
    "pop - iii stars with a salpeter imf provide only a @xmath115 increase in @xmath86 ( tumlinson & shull 2000 ) and can not account for the large @xmath33 .",
    "for plausible reionization histories with metal - free stars we have found that singly and doubly ionized helium contributes as much as @xmath116 , and should be included in reionization calculations .",
    "we also found that if the star formation efficiency is regulated in dwarf galaxies as observed in the local universe , then there is no significant contribution to the cosmic ionizing radiation field from halos with virial temperatures @xmath117k , even if molecular hydrogen permits cooling of gas inside these mini - halos",
    ".    the evolution of the ionization state and metal enrichment of the igm during the reionization epoch can be best probed by infrared spectroscopy of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows ( furlanetto & loeb 2002 ) .",
