    "[ sec : main ]    a famous theorem of lieb and mattis @xcite , with a subsequent remark by lieb in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* footnote 6 ) , proves `` ordering of energy levels '' for a large class of heisenberg models on bipartite lattices .",
    "namely , if the two sublattices are @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and all interactions within @xmath0 and @xmath1 are ferromagnetic while interactions in between @xmath0 and @xmath1 are antiferromagnetic , then the unique ground state multiplet has total spin equal to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the maximum total spins on the two sublattices .",
    "moreover , the minimum energy in the invariant subspace of total spin @xmath5 , for @xmath6 , is monotone increasing as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "an important example is the usual antiferromagnet on a bipartite lattice with equal - size sublattices .",
    "then the ground state is a unique spin singlet , and the minimum energy levels for each possible total spin @xmath5 , are monotone increasing in @xmath5 .    in this paper",
    "we derive a theorem about the ordering of energy levels for a class of _ ferromagnetic _ heisenberg models . for a ferromagnet",
    "we expect the minimum energy for fixed total spin @xmath5 to be monotone decreasing in @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , this agrees with the well - known fact that the ground state has maximum total spin , and also with the usually tacit assumption that the first excited state must have total spin equal to the maximal value minus one . on the regular lattices",
    "this can be deduced by an exact spin - wave calculation . on arbitrary graphs , or with spins of varying magnitudes , exact results are not available but",
    "our argument proves that monotone ordering holds at least in one - dimensional models .",
    "our main object of study is the ferromagnetic heisenberg chain of @xmath7 spins ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the spins may vary from site to site : @xmath9 , for @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , we allow arbitrary , positive coupling constants @xmath11 .",
    "the quantum hamiltonian is thus , @xmath12\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : ham}\\ ] ] here , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) denote the standard spin-@xmath15 matrices at site @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . without loss of generality ,",
    "we normalize the spin matrices by the magnitudes , @xmath15 , for later convenience , and subtract a constant so that the ground state energy vanishes .    since the hamiltonian is @xmath18 invariant , the vectors of a given total spin span an invariant subspace for @xmath19 .",
    "we call @xmath5 an admissible spin for @xmath19 if this subspace contains at least one nonzero vector . for admissible spins ,",
    "we define @xmath20 to be the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath19 among all those with eigenvectors of total spin @xmath5 .",
    "( we may define it to be infinite if @xmath5 is not admissible . ) clearly , the largest admissible spin for @xmath19 is @xmath21 .",
    "we say that ( strict ) ferromagnetic ordering of energy levels ( foel ) holds if it is true that @xmath22 ( with strict inequality ) whenever @xmath23 are a pair of admissible spins for @xmath19 .",
    "[ thm : main ] strict ferromagnetic ordering of energy levels holds for every nearest - neighbor spin chain , with hamiltonian as in ( [ eq : ham ] ) .    for the special case of the spin-@xmath24 chain",
    "this result was proved in @xcite .",
    "we conjecture that all ferromagnetic xxx models , i.e. , on _ any _ finite graph , have the foel property .",
    "in particular we expect foel for the model on a lattice in any dimension . in the case of constant spins , @xmath25 , and constant couplings , @xmath26 , on a lattice",
    ", a spin - wave calculation implies that the lowest excitations have total spin equal to @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , since the ground states have maximal total spin , one has @xmath28 for all @xmath29 .",
    "we are not aware of any previous conjectures and certainly no proofs for other values of @xmath30 or for the general case with arbitrary @xmath15 and @xmath11 .    as a major step in the proof of theorem 1",
    ", we will prove another monotonicity property of the energies @xmath31 .",
    "namely , suppose that @xmath32 is the hamiltonian of the form ( [ eq : ham ] ) for a ferromagnetic spin chain obtained by adding one or more spins to one of the ends of a spin chain with hamiltonian @xmath19 , and let @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote the maximum total spin of these spin chains respectively .",
    "then , for any @xmath35 , we have @xmath36 note that here the deviation , @xmath37 , of the maximum total spin is kept fixed .",
    "the inequality ( [ mono1 ] ) , which is part of theorem [ thm : mono ] below , has an appealing interpretation if we assume that the eigenstates corresponding to the minimum energy of fixed total spin describe a droplet of opposite magnetization ( for the spin @xmath38 xxz chain with either open or periodic b.c .",
    ", this has been proved in @xcite ) .",
    "( [ mono1 ] ) then states that the ground state energy of such a droplet decreases with increasing volume , much as if the droplet behaves as a free particle .",
    "we will prove theorem [ thm : main ] by an induction argument in which the system is built up in increments of total - spin @xmath24 .",
    "the total spin can be increased by @xmath24 in two ways : either a new spin @xmath24 can be appended to one end of the chain ; or else the magnitude of the spin at the end of the chain can be increased by @xmath24 .",
    "we call these case ( i ) and case ( ii ) , respectively . in this way",
    ", we obtain a sequence of models @xmath39 , for @xmath40 , and with @xmath41 spins of magnitude @xmath42 , which are of the form @xmath43\\ , , \\label{eq : hamnew}\\ ] ] and such that @xmath44 for a single spin @xmath24 , and @xmath45 is the model of ( [ eq : ham ] ) .    for any @xmath46 , if @xmath47 is obtained from @xmath48 as in case ( i ) , then @xmath49 . in case ( ii ) , there is an orthogonal projection @xmath50 , and one may define @xmath51 obtained from @xmath52 , as in case ( i ) .",
    "then @xmath53 projects onto the subspace of @xmath54 spanned by those vectors which have total spin equal to @xmath55 on the last two sites .",
    "the central part in the proof of theorem 1 is provided by the following theorem , which includes the monotonicity property mentioned in ( [ mono1 ] ) . here and later on",
    ", @xmath56 will denote the indentity operator on @xmath57 .",
    "[ thm : mono ] let @xmath58 be a sequence of hamiltonians as described above . for each @xmath59 , depending on whether @xmath47 is obtained from @xmath48 as in case ( i ) or ( ii ) , one of the following two relations holds @xmath60 moreover , if @xmath5 is an admissible spin for @xmath48 , then @xmath61 is admissible for @xmath47 , and @xmath62    we will prove theorem [ thm : mono ] later .",
    "assuming it , we can complete the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] , which we will do next .",
    "_ proof of theorem [ thm : main ] . _",
    "the proof is by induction .",
    "of course , @xmath63 satisfies foel , simply because there is only one possible spin , @xmath24 .",
    "suppose that @xmath48 satisfies strict foel .",
    "we have to show that @xmath47 also satisfies foel",
    ". we will consider cases ( i ) and ( ii ) , separately .    for case ( i )",
    ", suppose that @xmath23 are such that @xmath61 and @xmath64 are admissible for @xmath47 .",
    "note that since @xmath65 , this means that @xmath66 is admissible for @xmath48 .",
    "suppose that @xmath67 is the eigenvector of @xmath47 with total spin @xmath61 , and energy @xmath68 .",
    "we may assume that @xmath69 is a `` highest - weight '' vector , meaning that @xmath70 .",
    "then , by the clebsch - gordan series for @xmath18 @xcite , there are two highest - weight vectors @xmath71 , ( not both equal to zero ) with total - spins equal to @xmath5 and @xmath72 , respectively , and such that @xmath73 . using equation ( [ opineq ] )",
    ", we deduce the energy inequality @xmath74 cross terms of the form @xmath75 vanish since @xmath76 and @xmath77 are vectors of fixed but different total spin and @xmath48 commutes with the total spin .",
    "the rhs is a convex combination of the energies of @xmath76 and @xmath77 with respect to @xmath48 .",
    "these energies are no less than the minimum of @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "but , since @xmath48 satisfies foel , this minimum is never less than @xmath80 because @xmath81 .",
    "hence , @xmath82 .",
    "however , then using ( [ mono ] ) we deduce that @xmath83 which establishes the induction step .    in case ( ii )",
    ", we use the previous argument and the rayleigh - ritz variational principle .",
    "namely , from ( [ opineq ] ) , we conclude that @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is a hamiltonian on @xmath86 . by the previous argument",
    ", we conclude that @xmath87 .",
    "but by the variational principle , @xmath88 since the hamiltonians are the same , but in @xmath89 one minimizes over a smaller subspace : the range of @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , @xmath91 , and the rest of the argument follows case ( i ) .",
    "this concludes the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "_ proof of theorem [ thm : mono ] . _",
    "( [ opineq ] ) can be seen as follows . in case ( i ) , where @xmath47 is obtained by appending a spin-@xmath24 , it is clear that @xmath92 since the difference is a heisenberg interaction involving the new spin , which is non - negative by construction . in case ( ii ) , a simple calculation shows @xmath93 .",
    "our choice of spin normalization in ( [ eq : ham ] ) is precisely so as to make this relation hold without additional numerical factors .    to prove ( [ mono ] )",
    ", we first observe that @xmath79 can be calculated in the sector of _ highest weight _ vectors of total spin @xmath5 .",
    "these are vectors @xmath94 , of total spin @xmath5 , such that @xmath95 , or equivalently @xmath96 .",
    "we will calculate the matrix of @xmath48 restricted to this subspace in a special basis . in this basis , we find that all off - diagonal matrix elements are non - positive .",
    "let @xmath97 denote the dimension of the highest weight space of spin @xmath5 for the system @xmath48 , which is also equal to the multiplicity of the spin-@xmath5 representation in the chain with hilbert space @xmath52 .",
    "these multiplicities can be calculated by repeated use of the clebsch - gordan series for decomposing the tensor product of two spin representations into irreducible components . in doing this for the chains @xmath46 and @xmath98 , in each case starting by reducing the first two spins of the chain , then adding the third and so on",
    ", one sees that each spin-@xmath5 representation of the chain @xmath46 , gives rise to a spin-@xmath99 block in the chain @xmath98 . in case ( i )",
    "this is so because the last step is adding a spin @xmath24 . in case ( ii )",
    "this is true because the last spin is of magnitude @xmath24 greater in the chain @xmath98 than in the chain @xmath46 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath100 . moreover , it will be possible to choose the two bases in such a way that @xmath101 a perron - frobenius style theorem @xcite states that for any two square matrices @xmath102 , of size @xmath103 , and @xmath104 , of size @xmath37 , such that : ( i ) @xmath105 , ( ii ) all off - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are non - postive , ( iii ) @xmath106 for all @xmath107 , one has @xmath108 where , as before , @xmath109 denotes the lowest eigenvalue .",
    "the minimum eigenvalues are guaranteed to be simple if there exist @xmath110 and an integer power @xmath111 such that @xmath112 has all strictly positive matrix elements . if in addition either @xmath113 , or at least one of the inequalities between the matrix elements is strict , then @xmath114 .",
    "the inequality ( [ mono ] ) is then obtained by applying this result with @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "now , we construct the basis of the highest weight space .",
    "one can think of the state space at site @xmath16 as the symmetric part of @xmath117 spins-@xmath24 . as the order of the spins @xmath24 is irrelevant",
    ", we can label the @xmath118 states by the ising configurations    @xmath119 e.g. , @xmath120 is the vector normally labelled as @xmath121 , and _ not _ the tensor @xmath122 .",
    "the states for a chain of @xmath7 spins of magnitudes @xmath123 are then tensor products of these configurations .",
    "we shall call such vectors _ ordered ising configurations_.    now , we construct a basis for the spin chain consisting entirely of simultaneous eigenvectors of the total spin and its third component , with eigenvalues @xmath5 and @xmath124 , respectively .",
    "start from any ordered ising configuration such that @xmath125 . then , look for the leftmost @xmath126 that has a @xmath127 to its left , and draw an arc connecting this @xmath126 to the rightmost @xmath127 , left of it . at this point",
    ", one may ignore the paired spins , and repeat the procedure until there is no remaining unpaired @xmath126 with an unpaired @xmath127 to its left .",
    "this procedure guarantees that no arcs will cross and no arc will span an unpaired spin .",
    "the result , when ignoring all paired spins , is an ordered ising configuration of a single spin",
    ". see figure [ fig : fkbasis ] for an example of this procedure .",
    "the total - spin @xmath5 is equal to @xmath34 minus the number of pairs",
    ". clearly , the highest weight vectors are then those that have no unpaired @xmath126 .",
    "the vectors can be expanded in the tensor product basis by the following procedure : each arc is replaced by the spin singlet @xmath128 , and the unpaired spins are replaced by their tensor products . finally , one symmetrizes in each block . in the case",
    "@xmath129 for all @xmath16 , this was called the hulthn bracket basis by temperley and lieb @xcite , who also extended it to @xmath130 and proved that it is a basis .",
    "frenkel and khovanov introduced the general case @xcite .",
    "next , we calculate the matrix representation of the hamiltonians @xmath48 in the invariant subspaces of all highest weight vectors of a given total spin . this is most easily accomplished by deriving a graphical representation for the action of each term in the hamiltonian .",
    "we start with the case where all @xmath129 .",
    "then the interaction terms generate the temperley - lieb algebra with @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "the action of the negative of the interaction term in the hamiltonian can be graphically represented by @xmath132 we refer to the graphical diagram for @xmath133 as @xmath134 .",
    "let @xmath135 be the diagram for the basis vector @xmath136 .",
    "the graphical rules are as follows : ( i ) if @xmath16 and @xmath137 are both unpaired in @xmath135 , we have @xmath138 , ( ii ) if the composition of @xmath135 and @xmath134 is isotopic to @xmath139 , with @xmath140 , then the @xmath141 , ( iii ) if @xmath142 , then @xmath143 .",
    "this means that every loop contributes a factor of @xmath144 to @xmath145 .",
    "but this only happens when the `` cup '' of @xmath134 is paired with an arc in @xmath135 .",
    "this is clearly a diagonal term .",
    "if the last site of an arc for @xmath135 is @xmath16 , then there is no loop for @xmath146 with @xmath147 .    to generalize this to arbitrary values of @xmath15 , it is sufficient to write the heisenberg interaction for arbitrary spins as an interaction between spin @xmath24 s making up the spin @xmath15 and @xmath148 , conjugated with the projections onto the symmetric vectors .",
    "the result is the following : @xmath149 here , the rectangles with label @xmath150 represent the symmetrizing projections on the space of @xmath151 spin @xmath24 variables .",
    "the fundamental algebraic property that will allow us to calculate the matrix elements of @xmath48 graphically is the jones - wenzl relation ( c.f . , @xcite and references therein ) : @xmath152 for any element of the basis introduced above one can compute the action of the hamiltonian and write it as a linear combination of the same basis vectors .",
    "from the grahical rules it is easy to observe that all off - diagonal matrix elements are non - positive .    furthermore",
    ", with each basis vector for the system @xmath48 , we can identify a basis vector for the system @xmath47 .",
    "first , we consider the case where one spin @xmath38 has been added to the system @xmath48 . in that case",
    "one can simply add one box with one up - spin to each basis vector .",
    "this then corresponds to a basis vectors for the @xmath47 system where there is no arc to the last spin .",
    "the case of increasing the magnitude of one of the spins by @xmath38 can be treated in a similar way by again using the jones - wenzl projection . in this case , the label of the rightmost box in any basis vector for the @xmath48 system is raised by one but the number of arcs remains unchanged .",
    "again , this clearly leads to a subset of the basis vectors for the @xmath47 system .",
    "the crucial property that allows us to compare the two hamiltonians is the following .",
    "when @xmath47 acts on a basis vector obtained from a corresponding @xmath48 vector as we have just described , the only possible new terms that are generated are off - diagonal terms , which do not contain a bubble and , hence , are negative .",
    "the details of the calculation of these matrix elements and further applications will appear elsewhere @xcite .",
    "our results can be extended in various directions . we discuss two generalizations in particular .",
    "the first is the analogous problem for the anisotropic model , i.e. , the ferromagnetic xxz model , with anisotropy @xmath153 .",
    "of course , the xxz hamiltonian no longer has the full @xmath18 symmetry , but for the spin-@xmath24 chain there is an @xmath130-symmetric model obtained just by adding suitable boundary fields @xcite .",
    "the representation theory of @xmath130 is similar to that of @xmath18@xcite . using the @xmath130 symmetry",
    ", one can show that , for a chain of @xmath7 sites , the first excited state has total `` spin '' @xmath154 @xcite . by replacing the hulthn brackets with their @xmath155analogues",
    ", foel can be proved for the spin-@xmath24 xxz chains @xcite . in principle",
    "one can generalize this result to higher spin models as well , but one has to replace the standard xxz interaction by a quantum group symmetric interaction . since such examples are of a lesser physical relevance we do not pursue this .    the second type of generalization concerns higher order interactions with the full @xmath18 symmetry . as our argument to prove theorem [ thm : main ] only uses the symmetry of the hamiltonian , and not its exact form ,",
    "that result carries over immediately .",
    "the dual canonical basis of highest weight vectors also does not depend on the hamiltonian .",
    "theorem [ thm : mono ] requires , however , that the off - diagonal elements of the hamiltonian with respect to this basis are non - negative .",
    "this puts a restriction on the class of interactions . as an example",
    ", we consider the spin-1 chain .",
    "for this case there is one non - trivial parameter in the family of @xmath18-invariant nearest neighbor interactions , say the coefficient of the biquadratic term : @xmath156 it can be proved that the hamiltonian ( [ spin1 ] ) has foel whenever @xmath157 , and this result is optimal .    as a practical application of our results we point out the following .",
    "let @xmath19 be a hamiltonian satisfying foel and suppose one would like to find all the eigenvalues of @xmath19 below energy @xmath109 .",
    "it is sufficient to diagonalize @xmath19 in the subspaces with total spin @xmath158 , for @xmath159 , such that @xmath160 . the first value @xmath161 such that @xmath162 is large enough .",
    "it is then guaranteed that one has _",
    "all _ eigenvalues of the full @xmath19 below that value .",
    "this is interesting because the dimension of the subspace for a chain of length @xmath7 with total spin equal to @xmath163 is @xmath164 , while the full hilbert space has dimension @xmath165 ( when all particles have spin @xmath5 ) . in particular",
    ", one can obtain the gap by considering @xmath166 ."
