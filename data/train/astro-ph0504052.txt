    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most powerful explosions in the universe since the big bang .",
    "their cosmological origins are identified by the redshift measurements of their exploded remnants , usually named `` grb afterglows '' , or their host galaxies .",
    "grbs are common regarded as jetted phenomena , supported by the observational evidence that an achromatic break appears in the afterglow light curve , which declines more steeply than in the spherical model largely due to the edge effect and the laterally spreading effect ( rhoads 1999 ; sari et al . 1999 ) or the off - axis viewing effect ( rossi , lazzati & rees 2002 ; zhang & mszros 2002a ; berger et al .",
    "2003 ) . with the advantages of huge energy release for the prompt emission and immunity to dust extinction for the @xmath0-ray photons",
    ", grbs are widely believed to be detectable out to a very high redshift of @xmath15 ( lamb & reichart 2000 ; ciardi & loeb 2000 ; bromm & loeb 2002 ; gou et al . 2004 ) .",
    "similar to the phillips relation in type ia supernovae ( sne ia ; phillips 1993 ) , a tight relation in grbs , linking a couple of energetic and observational properties , could make grbs new standard candles .",
    "amati et al .",
    "( 2002 ) reported a power - law relation between the isotropic - equivalent @xmath0-ray energy @xmath1 of a grb and its rest - frame @xmath3 peak energy @xmath2 .",
    "unfortunately , the large scatter around this relation stymies its cosmological purpose .",
    "however , after joining the burst s half - opening angle @xmath16 , ghirlanda et al .",
    "( 2004a ) found that a tight relation is instead between the collimation - corrected energy @xmath17 and @xmath2 , which reads @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the power ) .",
    "recently , liang & zhang ( 2005 ) reported a multi - variable relation between @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and the local achromatic break @xmath4 of the burst s afterglow light curve , i.e. , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the powers ) . applying these two relations to different observed grb samples ,",
    "meaningful cosmological constraints have been performed in a series of works ( e.g. dai , liang & xu 2004 ; ghirlanda et al .",
    "2004b ; firmani et al .",
    "2005 ; xu , dai & liang 2005 ; ghisellini et al . 2005 ; qin et al . 2005 ; mortsell & sollerman 2005 ; liang & zhang 2005 ; bertolami & silva 2005 ; lamb et al .",
    "2005 for a grb mission plan to investigate the properties of dark energy ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the well - measured spectral and energetic properties of the up - to - date 20 grbs in their cosmological frames and report a new relation between @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath2 , which is @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 is the power ) .",
    "more importantly , inspiring constraints on cosmological parameters can be achieved if this newly found relation is indeed an intrinsic one for the observed grb sample .",
    "the `` bolometric '' isotropic - equivalent energy of a grb is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the fluence in the observed bandpass and @xmath29 is a multiplicative correction relating the observed bandpass with a standard rest - frame bandpass ( 1-@xmath30 kev ) ( bloom , frail & sari 2001 ) , with its fractional uncertainty @xmath31 thus , the collimation - related energy @xmath23 ( see @xmath32 of this work ) is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the observed break time of the afterglow light curve in the optical band , with its fractional uncertainty @xmath35    to calculate @xmath29-correction of a burst , one is required to know its spectral parameters fitted by the band function , i.e. , the low - energy spectral index @xmath36 , the high - energy spectral index @xmath37 , and the observed peak energy @xmath38 ( band et al .",
    "1993 ) . in this paper , we considered those grbs with known redshifts , fluences , spectral parameters , and break times , and thus collected a sample of 20 bursts shown in table 1 .",
    "the criterions of our data selection are : ( 1 ) the fluence and spectral parameters of a burst are chosen from the same original literature as possible . if different fluences are reported in that literature , we choose the measurement in the widest energy band .",
    "if this criterion is unsatisfied , we choose the fluence measured in the widest energy band available in other literature ; ( 2 ) the observed break time for each burst is taken from its data in the optical band ; ( 3 ) when the fractional uncertainties of @xmath39 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are not reported in the literature , they are taken to be @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively ; ( 4 ) to be more reliable , a lower limit of the fractional uncertainty of @xmath34 is set to be @xmath41 .    in this section",
    ", we investigate the @xmath43 and @xmath44 relations for a friedmann - roberston - walker cosmology with mass density @xmath45 and vacuum energy density @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , the theoretical luminosity distance in equations ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) is given by @xmath47^{-1/2}\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the present hubble constant , and `` sinn '' is @xmath50 for @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath53 . for @xmath54 , equation ( 5 )",
    "degenerates to be @xmath55 times the integral ( carroll et al .",
    "according to the conclusions of the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( wmap ) observations , we here choose @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath56 ( e.g. spergel et al .",
    "the dashed and solid lines in figure 1 respectively represent the best - fit powerlaws for the @xmath43 and @xmath44 relations ( weighting for the uncertainties on both coordinates , see press et al .",
    "we find @xmath57 with a reduced @xmath58 , and @xmath59 with a reduced @xmath60 .",
    "as can be seen , although the power of the @xmath43 relation in this work is roughly consistent with that in amati et al .",
    "( 2002 ) derived from 9 _ bepposax _ bursts , i.e. , @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) , the dispersion around this relation increases seriously . instead",
    ", the scatter of the @xmath44 relation is rather small .",
    "one may notice that it is the @xmath44 relation rather than the amati relation whose power more converges at @xmath63 .",
    "based on the above statistical findings , we consider the @xmath44 relation for the observed grb sample to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "the @xmath44 relation can be given by @xmath64 where the dimensionless parameters @xmath65 and @xmath26 are assumed to have no covariance .",
    "combining equations ( 3 ) and ( 8) , we derive the apparent luminosity distance as @xmath66 with its fractional uncertainty being @xmath67 where all the quantities are assumed to be independent of each other and their uncertainties follow gaussian distributions .",
    "the distance modulus is calculated by @xmath68 , and its uncertainty is computed through @xmath69 .    although the @xmath44 relation is similar to the phillips relation in sne ia , the methods by which to constrain cosmological parameters are different ( riess et al . 1998 ; firmani et al .",
    "2005 , xu et al . 2005 ) . for sne ia",
    ", a phillips - like relation is known to those relatively high-@xmath70 objects after it has been calibrated by nearby well - observed sne ia , because the theoretical luminosity distance is irrelevant with cosmological parameters , i.e. @xmath71 , when @xmath72 .",
    "while for grbs , one wo nt know that sole set of @xmath73- parameters in the @xmath44 relation until a low-@xmath70 grb sample is established .",
    "therefore , the @xmath74 statistic for grbs is @xmath75 } ^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath76 denotes a certain cosmology , and @xmath77 is taken as 0.71 in this work .",
    "we carry out a bayesian approach to obtain grbs constraints on cosmological parameters . for clarity , we divide it into three stages with the detailed steps as follows :    * stage i *    \\(1 ) fix @xmath78 , ( 2 ) calculate @xmath79 and @xmath23 for each burst for that cosmology , ( 3 ) best fit the @xmath44 relation to yield @xmath80 and @xmath81 , ( 4 ) apply the best - fit relation parametrized by @xmath80 and @xmath81 to the observed sample , and thus derive @xmath82 and @xmath83 for each burst for that cosmology , ( 5 ) repeat steps 1@xmath844 from @xmath85 to @xmath86 to obtain @xmath79 , @xmath82 and @xmath87 for each burst for each cosmology ;    * stage ii *    \\(6 ) re - fix @xmath88 , ( 7 ) calculate @xmath89 by comparing @xmath90 with @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and then convert it to a conditional probability , i.e. , probability for @xmath88 which is contributed by the relation calibrated for @xmath93 , by the formula of @xmath94 $ ] , ( 8) repeat step 7 from @xmath85 to @xmath95 to obtain an iterative probability for cosmology @xmath88 by @xmath96\\times p^{\\rm ini}(\\omega _ i ) } $ ] ( here the initial probability for each cosmology is regarded as equal , i.e. , @xmath97 ) , ( 9 ) repeat steps 6@xmath848 from @xmath98 to @xmath99 to obtain an iterative probability @xmath100 for each cosmology ;    * stage iii *    the iterative probability @xmath100 for each cosmology derived on step 9 is no longer equal to its initial probability @xmath101 , but it has not reached the final / converged probability @xmath102 .",
    "so the following process is to ( 10 ) assign @xmath100 on step 9 to @xmath101 on step 8 , then repeat steps 8@xmath849 , and thus reach another set of iterative probabilities for each cosmology , ( 11 ) run the above iteration cycle again and again until the probability for each cosmology converges , i.e. , @xmath103 after tens of cycles .    in this method , to calculate the probability for a favored cosmology , we consider contributions of all the possible @xmath44 relations associated with their weights . the conditional probability @xmath104 denotes the contribution of some certain relation , and @xmath105 weights the likelihood of this relation for its corresponding cosmology .",
    "therefore , this bayesian approach can be formulized by @xmath106    shown in figure 2 are the constraints for @xmath107 from 20 observed grbs ( solid contours ) , using the likelihood procedure presented here .",
    "the grb dataset is consistent with @xmath13 and @xmath14 , yielding a @xmath12 . for a flat universe",
    ", we measure @xmath9 at the @xmath108 confidence level ( c.l . ) .",
    "the best - fit point is @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( red cross ) .",
    "shape of the elliptic confidence contours trends to well constrain @xmath45 and provide evidence for cosmic acceleration with an enlarged grb sample . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the constraints from 157 gold sne ia in riess et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ( dashed contours ) . closed @xmath111 ranges derived from these two datasets at the same c.l.s have conveyed the advantages of high-@xmath70 distance indicators in constraining cosmological parameters as well as other cosmological issues .",
    "additionally , grbs are complementary to sne ia on the cosmological aspect .",
    "we see from the figure that a combination of sne and grbs wound make the cosmic model of @xmath13 and @xmath14 more favored , thus better in agreement with the result form wmap observations ( e.g. bennett et al .",
    "grbs are hopeful to be new standard candles .",
    "we report a new relation between grb rest - frame energetics and spectra , which is @xmath112 ( @xmath6 ) for @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath56 . considering this power - law relation for the 20 observed grbs , we find a constraint on the mass density @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) for a flat universe together with a @xmath12 for @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "as previously discussed , the ghirlanda relation reads @xmath113 ( @xmath19 is the power ) under the framework of uniform jet model . within this model",
    ", one can calculate the half - opening angle of a grb jet by @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the uniform circumburst medium density , and @xmath116 denotes the conversion efficiency of the initial ejecta s kinetic energy to @xmath0-ray energy release ( rhoads 1999 ; sari et al .",
    "thanks to strong collimation for grbs , i.e. @xmath117 , the ghirlanda relation becomes @xmath118 . in ghirlanda",
    "et al . ( 2004a ) , the term of @xmath119 was assumed to be highly clustered for the whole sample of 15 bursts presented there , thus the ghirlanda relation turns out to be @xmath120 .",
    "so if @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) , there will be @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) . in this sense , the @xmath125 and @xmath44 relations are consistent with each other .",
    "however , @xmath116 should be different from burst to burst ( e.g. @xmath126 ) , and @xmath115 is variable for a burst in the wind environment and may expand in several orders ( see friedman & bloom 2004 and references therein ) . additionally , these two observables and their uncertainties are very difficult to be reliably estimated . therefore ,",
    "if the ghirlanda relation is used to measure cosmology , the resulting constraints would depend on different input assumptions of @xmath116 and @xmath115 .",
    "for contrast , such difficulties have been circumvented when applying the @xmath44 relation .",
    "moreover , liang & zhang ( 2005 ) reported a generalized relation between grb rest - frame spectra and energetics could be written as @xmath127 for a flat universe of @xmath128 , using a multiple variable regression method for the 15 bursts presented there .",
    "their conclusion is consistent with our statistical result ( see @xmath129 in this work ) .",
    "more loose constraints , however , were performed when the uncertainties of the fitted parameters in this relation were included into the error of the apparent distance modulus ( see fig 11 in liang & zhang 2005 ) . among the discussed three relations ,",
    "the @xmath44 relation is the simplest and the latter two have the advantage of making the relations explicitly model - independent and eliminating the needs to marginalize over the unknown @xmath116 and @xmath115 .    so what is the underlying theoretical basis for the @xmath44 relation ? at the present stage , plausible explanations mainly include : the standard synchrotron mechanisms in relativistic shocks ( e.g. zhang & mszros 2002b ; dai & lu 2002 ) , the high - energy emission form off - axis relativistic jets ( e.g. yamazaki et al .",
    "2004 ; eichler & levinson 2004 ; levinson & eichler 2005 ) , and the dissipative photosphere model producing a relativistic outflow ( e.g. rees & mszros 2005 ) .",
    "the scaling relation depends on the details of each model , and it resembles the observational result under certain simplification .",
    "although models are different , the relation they support has made grbs towards more and more standardized candles .",
