    "analyzing models of biological oscillations , however , is generally not easy : the mechanisms underlying biological rhythms are varied and complex , and this complexity is reflected in the corresponding mathematical models .",
    "indeed , models of biological oscillators are often high dimensional , highly nonlinear , and have uncertain parameters , all of which make them challenging to study",
    ".    perturbation theory , long a staple of applied mathematics , provides a practical solution in many situations .",
    "mathematically , robust oscillations correspond to attracting limit cycles in phase space .",
    "if the stimuli involved are not too strong , then one is justified in viewing trajectories of the forced system as perturbations of the original limit cycle . when judiciously applied , such perturbative analyses can yield a great deal of insight and useful quantitative predictions . for oscillators , a good example of an effective perturbation technique",
    "is that of infinitesimal phase response curves ( prcs ) and associated phase reductions @xcite .",
    "the infinitesimal prc of an oscillator records the _ phase change _ that results from an applied perturbation .",
    "given an oscillator , there are many ways to obtain its infinitesimal prc : in addition to analytical perturbation techniques , there are efficient numerical methods for constructing prcs ; the entire prc itself can even be inferred directly from experimental data .",
    "moreover , prc - based techniques require only tracking just the phase of the oscillator , thereby greatly reducing complexity .",
    "they are used in many areas of mathematical biology , but especially in computational neuroscience , as they yield direct predictions about the modulation of spike timing and frequency by external stimuli .",
    "furthermore , they allow one to make predictions for weakly - coupled networks @xcite  .",
    "however , as is well known , perturbation methods do not always correctly reflect the true dynamical picture , as they systematically overlook certain aspects of the dynamics . in using perturbation theory ,",
    "one _ assumes _ that the perturbation is small , an assumption that is not always valid in applications . in this paper , we identify a number of concrete scenarios in which prcs and phase reductions give predictions different from that of the full model .",
    "one situation is when the perturbation causes the trajectory to leave the basin of attraction of the limit cycle , which can occur even with moderately weak forcing .",
    "but even without leaving the basin , more subtle effects can lead perturbation theory astray , giving  to varying degrees  incorrect predictions .",
    "these situations include the presence of `` sticky '' invariant phase - space structures near a limit cycle , which can cause perturbation theory to overestimate the regularity and frequency of a stimulated oscillator .",
    "we will also show that dynamical shear in a neighborhood of the oscillator can cause it to behave chaotically when forced .",
    "these scenarios can not be captured by infinitesimal phase reductions .",
    "the scenarios described in this paper are relevant for general oscillators , but in view of the popularity of prc - based techniques in neuroscience , we will illustrate our ideas using the morris - lecar ( ml ) neuron model  @xcite .",
    "this widely - used model provides a convenient and flexible example because of its low dimensionality and rich bifurcation structure .",

    "we discuss briefly in this subsection a few scenarios in which the behavior of the flow a finite distance away from @xmath2 can have a dramatic effect on the oscillator s response .",
    "these ideas are illustrated in concrete examples in sects .",
    "[ sect : shear ]  [ sect : bistable ] .",
    "\\(1 ) _ leaving the basin of @xmath2_. the simplest possible way for something to go wrong is when the forcing carries a phase point outside of the basin of attraction of @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath40 denotes the unforced flow , then the basin of @xmath2 , denoted @xmath41 , is defined to be the set of all phase points @xmath10 such that @xmath42 as @xmath43 .",
    "once a perturbation , say in the form of a  kick \" , causes a trajectory to leave @xmath41 , what it does may depend on dynamical structures far away from @xmath2 .",
    "for example , if the system is bistable , or multi - stable , i.e. , it has more than one attracting set , which can be in the form of a stationary point , a limit cycle , or something more complicated , then an  escaped \" trajectory can end up near one of these structures , and in time , it may  or may not  get kicked back into @xmath44 . needless to say ,",
    "the behavior of such a trajectory bears little resemblance to that predicted by the prc .",
    "this scenario must be taken into consideration when the forcing is strong relative to the distance of @xmath45 to @xmath2 .",

    "\\(2 ) _ invariant structures and  trapping\"_. even without venturing outside of @xmath44 , a perturbed trajectory that comes near @xmath45 can be nontrivially affected by certain dynamical structures in @xmath45 .",
    "these structures may seem innocuous  they are non - attracting  but as we will see , they can seriously impact the surrounding dynamics .",
    "consider , for example , a saddle fixed point of the unperturbed flow .",
    "an orbit that comes near it will , under the unperturbed flow , remain near it for some duration of time ( depending on the ratios of the eigenvalues of the linearized flow at that point ) . since an invariant structure is typically not truly invariant for the perturbed flow , a perturbed trajectory that gets near it will likely escape eventually and return to @xmath2",
    ". however , the escape time can be quite long , and this effect can not be captured by phase reductions . the tendency to remain near invariant structures can be mitigated by the forcing when the forcing acts to push trajectories away ; by the same token , it can also be magnified if the forcing  conspires \" to keep trajectories in a region .",
    "indeed , there is no reason why a forcing can not  by itself  create trapping regions within the basin of @xmath2 if the attraction to @xmath2 is weak compared to the forcing .",
    "\\(3 ) _ shear - induced chaos_. this is yet another dynamical phenomenon that can not be captured by ( infinitesimal ) prcs .",
    "this phenomenon is illustrated in fig .  [ shear ] . in each of the two pictures , @xmath2",

    "shear refers to the differential in the horizontal component of the velocity as one moves vertically up in the phase space ; here points above @xmath2 move around @xmath2 faster than points below .",
    "suppose that an impulsive perturbation , or `` kick , '' applied in such a situation produces a  bump \" in @xmath2 .",
    "as the flow relaxes , this  bump \" is attracted back to the original limit cycle .",

    ", we mention that invariant structures in @xmath45 can be a contributing factor to shear , but shear can also arise for many other reasons . since the results on shear - induced chaos alluded to above",
    "are not widely known in the mathematical biology community , we will provide a more detailed review in the next subsection .",
    "in this section , we review some of the geometric ideas put forth in @xcite ( and also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the exposition here roughly follows @xcite , which contains a more thorough ( but still non - technical ) discussion .",
    "we focus here on _ periodically - kicked oscillators , _ since in this setting the various dynamical mechanisms are most transparent .",

    "( [ eq : periodic - kicks ] ) thus models an oscillator that is given a sharp `` kick '' every @xmath50 units of time .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath58 , then @xmath59 is an attractor for the periodically kicked system @xmath60 .",
    "one can view @xmath61 as what becomes of the limit cycle @xmath2 when the oscillator is periodically kicked .",
    "the structure of @xmath62 and the associated dynamics depends strongly on the kick parameters @xmath63 and @xmath50 , as well as on the relation between the kick map @xmath52 and the flow near @xmath2  .",
    "when @xmath63 is small , we generally expect @xmath62 to be a slightly perturbed version of @xmath2  , because ( as is well known ) hyperbolic limit cycles are robust under small perturbations  @xcite . in this case , @xmath62 is known as an _ invariant circle , _ and the restriction of @xmath60 to @xmath62 is equivalent to a diffeomorphism on @xmath64  .",
    "circle diffeomorphisms are well known to exhibit essentially two distinct types of behavior : _ quasiperiodic motion , _ in which the mapping is equivalent to rotation by an irrational angle , and _ gradient - like _ behavior characterized by sinks and sources on the invariant circle . in terms of the kicked oscillator dynamics ,",
    "the former corresponds to the driven oscillator drifting in and out of phase relative to the kicks , while the latter corresponds to stable phase - locking .",
    "the preceding discussion suggests that when kicks are weak , we should expect fairly regular behavior . to obtain more complicated behavior ,",
    "it is necessary to `` break '' the invariant circle .",
