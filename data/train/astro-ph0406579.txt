    "the investigation into the nature and origin of celestial gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has been one of the major challenges of high energy astrophysics , since they were discovered by chance about 30 years ago with the _ vela _ satellites @xcite .",
    "the grb origin remained uncertain even when the _ burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) _ experiment aboard the _ compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) _ in the 1990s provided a much larger sample of grbs ( about 3000 events ) .",
    "many outstanding results were obtained with batse , among them the completely isotropic distribution on the sky of grbs and the inconsistency of the grb number versus peak intensity relation with a homogeneous volume distribution in space , inplying a deficit of faint bursts @xcite .",
    "two main explanations were given for these statistical properties : either grbs have their origin in neutron stars distributed in a large galactic halo at more than 100 kpc distance @xcite or grbs have an origin in sources at cosmological distances @xcite .",
    "it was recognized ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that the identification of a grb counterpart at other wavelengths was needed in order to make a breakthrough in setting the distance scale of grbs . now the distance scale issue of at least the long ( @xmath1  s ) grbs has been definitely settled thanks to the x  ray astronomy mission _ bepposax _ , an italian satellite with dutch participation@xcite .",
    "_ bepposax _",
    "has also provided the most exciting results of the last six years in grb astronomy .",
    "the high performance of _ bepposax _  for grb studies is due to a particularly well - matched configuration of its payload , with both wide field and narrow field instruments ( wfis and nfis ) .",
    "the wfis consist of a @xmath0ray ( 40700 kev ) all  sky monitor , the _ gamma - ray burst monitor _ ( _ grbm _ ) @xcite , and two wide - field cameras ( wfcs ) instruments covering the 228 kev energy band @xcite .",
    "the nfis include four focusing x  ray ( 0.110 kev ) telescopes ( one _ _ low - energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs)__@xcite and three _ medium - energy concentrator spectrometers ( mecs ) _",
    "the nfis also have two higher energy direct viewing detectors ( the _ high pressure gas scintillation proportional counter ( hpgspc ) _ @xcite and the _ phoswich detector system ( pds ) _ @xcite ) .",
    "the _ bepposax _  capability of precisely localizing grbs was soon tested , only one month after first light of the satellite , with the detection of grb960720 @xcite .",
    "starting from december 1996 , at the _ bepposax_science operation center , an alert procedure for the search of simultaneous _ grbm _ and _ wfcs _ detections of grb events was implemented .",
    "thanks to this procedure , the first x  ray afterglow of a grb , grb970228 , was discovered on 28 february 1997 @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , an optical counterpart of the x  ray afterglow source was detected @xcite .",
    "less than two months later , the first optical redshift ( @xmath2 ) of grb970508 was obtained thanks to the prompt localization provided by _ bepposax _ , @xcite .",
    "the location of grbs at cosmic distances was definitely established . at the same time , an exciting result on the grb source properties came from radio observations of the same event : the radio afterglow exhibited rapid variations for about one month due to interstellar scintillations @xcite .",
    "thus , only a very compact source , expanding highly relativistically , could be the origin of grbs @xcite .",
    "since the first detection of an x  ray afterglow , many other grb afterglows have been detected , mainly with _",
    "bepposax _  and , less often , with other satellites , i.e. , the rntgensatellit ( _ rosat _ ) , the _ rossi x  ray time explorer ( rxte ) _ , the _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( asca ) _ , the _ chandra x  ray observatory - axaf ( chandra ) _ , and the _ xmm - newton ( xmm)_. in this paper i review the status of our knowledge of grb x  ray afterglows and discuss their implications . in sect.[s : obs ]",

    "s : early ] , i discuss the early afterglow emission and its distinctive features with respect to the prompt emission ; and in sect[s : issues ] , i summarize the open questions and the prospects for future x  ray afterglow observations .",
    "tables  [ t : tab1 ] , [ t : tab2 ] and [ t : tab3 ] summarize the main results of the x  ray searches for grb afterglows . in the following provides further elaboration .      table [ t : tab1 ] lists the information on grb follow - up observations of x  ray afterglows as of december 2001 .",
    "two x  ray rich events , grb011030 @xcite and grb011130 @xcite , were not included in the list .",
    "grb011030 was observed by _",
    "@xcite following the discovery of a radio transient in the grb error box @xcite and an x  ray source was detected but no fading observed @xcite .",
    "grb011130 was also observed by _",
    "chandra _ and several x ",
    "ray sources were detected but no conclusions could be drawn as to their association with the grb @xcite .",
    "as can be seen , most of the 43 grbs listed in table  [ t : tab1 ] were promptly localized with the _ bepposax _  wfcs , with the _ rxte proportional counter array ( pca ) _ , the _ all sky monitor ( asm ) _ and the 3rd _ interplanetary network ( ipn ) _ contributing some additional examples .",
    "the minimum starting time of the follow - up observations ranges from 23 hr for _ rxte _ , to 56 hr for _ bepposax _ , to longer times for the other satellites .",
    "given its limited sensitivity , the _ rxte pca _ has provided positive results only for very strong afterglow fluxes ( few mcrab ) and for a limited time interval .",
    "unfortunately most of these pca events were not followed up with more sensitive instruments .",
    "the criterion for establishing the afterglow nature of an x  ray source is its fading on time scales of a few hours or days .",
    "unfortunately , for the weakest sources this fading could not be well established , as the detected flux was very close to the instrument sensitivity limit . in these cases",
    "the source found in the grb error box could be a serendipitous field source unrelated to an x  ray afterglow , even though the probability of such a chance coincidence is low ( see the notes to table  [ t : tab1 ] ) . with this caveat in mind ,",
    "37 of the followed 43 grbs ( 86% ) , show x  ray afterglows at a level @xmath3  erg  @xmath4  s@xmath5 in the 210 kev band .",
    "thus , the detection rate of x  ray afterglows is about two times higher than that for optical afterglows ( see the chapter by e. pian ) . therein lies the mystery of the so - called `` dark bursts ''",
    ", i.e. , bursts which show an x  ray afterglow but not optical emission ( see section  [ s : issues ] ) .",
    "the spectral shape of the x  ray afterglow emission gives important information about establishing the emission mechanisms .",
    "an initial question was whether the x  ray continuum emission was thermal or nonthermal .",
    "the x  ray afterglow of grb970228 showed @xcite that , in the x - ray range ( 0.110 kev ) , a blackbody model was not acceptable .",
    "the photon spectrum was well fit with a simple photoelectrically absorbed power - law ( see table  [ t : tab2 ] ) .",
    "this spectral shape has been found in all x  ray afterglows known , although for some grbs ( grb980329 @xcite and grb981226 @xcite ) , in which thermal models were tested , it was found that the data do not have sufficient signal - to - noise to discriminate between power  law and blackbody models .",
    "table  [ t : tab2 ] reports the best fit power ",
    "law photon indices _ i _ ( where the photon index _",
    "i _ is related to the flux density _ f _ spectral index @xmath6 , @xmath7 , by @xmath8 ) and absorbing hydrogen column densities @xmath9 .",
    "the values reported in square brackets were kept fixed during the fit . for comparison , the galactic hydrogen column densities @xmath10 values along the grb directions",
    "are also reported @xcite .",
    "the best fit values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 are available for only the brightest of the detected afterglows .",
    "most of the spectra have been determined up to 10 kev , and in only one case ( grb990123 ) was the source detected up to 60 kev with the _ bepposax _  pds instrument , also confirming the power  law shape .",
    "as can be seen from table  [ t : tab2 ] , due to the low statistical quality of the x  ray data , in many cases the galactic @xmath10 was assumed ( in square brackets ) in the spectral fitting . in the cases for which estimates of @xmath12 were derived",
    ", they are consistent , within the uncertainties , with the galactic values , except for seven grbs ( grb970828 , grb980329 , grb980703 , grb990510 , grb000926 , grb001109 , grb010222 ) for which the derived @xmath12 is significantly higher than the galactic value .",
    "since the reported @xmath12 values have been derived assuming only local , galactic absorption ( @xmath13 ) , the true @xmath12 may be even higher , if it is in the host galaxy or in the ambient medium around the burst .",
    "for example , weiler at al @xcite ( see also the chapter by weiler et al . in @xcite ) found that significant amount of optical extinction can be ascribed to the burst host galaxy or its local surroundings .    the best fit photon indices @xmath14 range from @xmath15 to @xmath16 with a roughly gaussian distribution with standard deviation @xmath17 and mean value @xmath18 , which is very close to the power law index of the well known synchrotron source , the crab nebula ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the only evidence of spectral variability is for grb970508 and grb00026 listed in table  [ t : tab2 ] . for comparison ,",
    "the prompt 2700 kev emission from grbs with detected x  ray afterglow is generally well described @xcite by a photoeletrically absorbed , smoothly broken power ",
    "law @xcite with low  energy index @xmath20 ( below the break ) , high energy index @xmath21 above the break , and peak energy @xmath22 of the @xmath23 spectra , all which evolve rapidly with time .",
    "one relevant feature of these spectra is that , at the grb onset , @xmath22 is generally above the energy passband of the _ bepposax _  grbm @xcite ( see the example in fig .  [",
    "f : grb971214_sp ] ) .",
    "several hints , such as the non thermal shape of the spectra and detection of polarized emission from the optical counterparts of two afterglows ( grb990510 @xcite and grb990712 @xcite ) point to synchrotron radiation as the basic emission mechanism of the electromagnetic radiation from grb afterglows . also , in the case of the prompt emission , synchrotron radiation appears to play an important role , even if other emission processes such as inverse compton ( ic ) may contribute at the earliest times ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "synchrotron radiation is expected within the framework of the fireball model ( see , e.g. , reviews by piran @xcite and references therein ) as a result of the interaction between a relativistically expanding fireball and the external medium (  external shock  ) .",
    "detailed calculations of the expected synchrotron spectral shape and its time evolution have been carried out for various external medium conditions ( homogeneous medium @xcite , or radially declining density wind @xcite ) .",
    "also the effect of ic scattering of low - energy synchrotron photons on shock  accelerated electrons has been investigated ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "following sari et al .",
    "@xcite , for the case of a homogeneous medium , the instantaneous synchrotron energy spectrum @xmath24 is schematically described by a multi  broken power ",
    "law , with four different slopes . at low frequencies ,",
    "the flux density @xmath25 holds up to the synchrotron self  absorption ( ssa ) frequency @xmath26 , then @xmath27 from @xmath26 up to the peak frequency @xmath28 ( @xmath28 corresponds to the minimum  energy of the shock  accelerated electrons ) . at still higher frequencies ,",
    "the spectrum is related to the energy distribution of the electrons , which is assumed to exhibit a power law shape @xmath29(@xmath30 is the electron energy ) from @xmath28 up to the cooling frequency @xmath31 ( @xmath32 corresponds to the highest energy electrons that cool more rapidly than the expansion time of the source ) , by means of @xmath33 , while above @xmath31 , @xmath34 . depending on the shock evolution , fully adiabatic or fully radiative , the characteristic frequencies @xmath28 and @xmath31 and the maximum flux density @xmath35 vary in different ways with time . for the fully adiabatic case , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . for the fully radiative case @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in the latter case , @xmath35 also changes with time as @xmath40 .",
    "the different time behaviour of the characteristic frequencies is thus expected to affect not only the spectral evolution of the emission but also the time behaviour of the afterglow light curves ( see section  [ s : time ] ) .",
    "the multiwavelength spectrum of the grb970508 afterglow fits this scheme very nicely @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , broad band spectra are available for only a very limited number of grbs .",
    "an attempt to collect the available data to estimate the multiwavelength spectra of grb afterglows was performed @xcite , but the data are still scarce .",
    "most of the few available spectra are consistent with the synchrotron shock model ( in addition to grb970508 , grb971216 @xcite , grb980703 @xcite , and grb991216 @xcite ) . however , in two cases ( grb000926 @xcite and grb010222 @xcite ) , the multiwavelength spectra clearly deviate from the shape expected from the synchrotron model .",
    "in both cases , the radio and optical data fit a synchrotron spectrum very well , but the extrapolation of the spectrum to x - rays is below the measured x - ray flux density .",
    "harrison et al .",
    "@xcite interpret this mismatch as due to the presence of a self  inverse compton component .",
    "the ambient medium density derived is @xmath41  @xmath42 , which is higher than the average interstellar medium ( ism ) density in a typical galaxy ( @xmath43  @xmath42 ) , but is consistent with a diffuse interstellar cloud such as those found in star forming regions .    assuming a synchrotron origin , the photon indices @xmath14 listed in table  [ t : tab2 ] permit an estimate to be made of the power ",
    "law index of the energy distribution of the electrons accelerated in the external shocks .",
    "given that most of the x  ray afterglow measurements were performed considerably after the main event ( see table  [ t : tab1 ] for the start times ) , these can be reasonably assumed to be taken in the regime of @xmath44 , when the peak of the spectrum had moved toward the optical range .",
    "thus , the electron index @xmath45 is related to the photon index by one of two equations : either @xmath46 or @xmath47 , depending whether the x - ray band is between @xmath28 and @xmath31 ( fast cooling ) or beyond these frequencies ( slow cooling ) . from the mean value of @xmath14",
    ", we can derive a mean value of the electron index @xmath48 in the range from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , depending on the cooling regime .",
    "one of the most peculiar properties of the x  ray afterglow light curves is their power  law decay ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the power  law fading was already noted in the first x - ray afterglow source 1sax j0501.7 + 1146 associated with grb970228 @xcite .",
    "the x  ray fading slope ( @xmath52 ) was consistent with that ( @xmath53 ) of the simultaneously discovered optical counterpart @xcite .",
    "the power  law decay index and the photon index of the grb970228 afterglow ( see values in table  [ t : tab2 ] ) were also found to be consistent with the relationship predicted by the fireball model and gave strong support to that model ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "almost all other x  ray afterglow sources discovered so far show a similar power  law decay or , in a few cases , a broken power ",
    "table  [ t : tab2 ] reports the best fit temporal indices , @xmath54 , measured .",
    "apart from grb980425 , which will be discussed separately below , the power ",
    "law indices are distributed like a gaussian with mean value @xmath55 , and standard deviation @xmath56 .",
    "a relevant feature of the light curves is that their extrapolation back to the time of the grb event is , in general , consistent with the tail of the prompt x - ray light curve .",
    "this fact is in some cases directly misured ( grb970228 @xcite and grb970508 @xcite ) and in other cases is inferred from a different approach ( see section  [ s : early ] ) .    in a few cases ( grb990510 @xcite , grb010222 @xcite and grb010214 @xcite ) comparison of the intensity level of the tail of the prompt emission with the late afterglow light curve (",
    "start time several hrs after the grb event ) , shows that a broken power  law may be more consistent with the data . in table",
    "[ t : tab2 ] the power ",
    "law indices and break times of these grbs are reported .",
    "the x  ray breaks are found to be consistent with those seen in the optical light curves ( see @xcite for grb990510 , and @xcite for grb010222 ) .",
    "the interpretation of achromatic breaks in the light curves of grb afterglows has been discussed by various authors . in the framework of the fireball model",
    ", a break is expected if the relativistically expanding material is concentrated within a cone with angular width @xmath57 . as long as the lorentz factor @xmath58 of the ouflowing material is larger than @xmath59 , due to relativistic beaming",
    ", the radiation is emitted within an angle @xmath60 from the cone axis , with @xmath61 .",
    "when @xmath58 drops below @xmath59 , the observer begins to see the edge of the cone and then the effect of the collimated outflow , which causes a light curve steepening . at the same time ( @xmath62 ) , the jet begins to expand sideways , increasing the rate of decrease of the emitted radiation even more .",
    "this model has been discussed and detailed for various external conditions by several authors ( see e.g. , @xcite and references therein )",
    ".    assuming synchrotron radiation , adiabatic expansion and a homogeneous ambient medium , following sari et al .",

    "this result seems to disagree with the results of frail et al.@xcite who , by examining the multiwavelength light curves of a sample of 17 grb afterglows find a break in a large fraction of them which they interpret as evidence for an expanding jet . they derive the jet opening angle for each of them .",

    "taking into account that three of these grbs have host galaxies with known redshifts ( 0.835 for grb970508 @xcite , 0.9578 for grb970828 @xcite and 1.02 for grb991216 @xcite ) , the line features in their respective co - moving frames are consistent with fe fluorescence lines ( fe i  fe xx k@xmath6 line in the case of grb970508 , fe k line of h  like ions in the case of the lower energy line from grb991216 ) or fe recombination edges ( recombination of fe h  like ions for both the line feature from grb970828 and the higher energy feature from grb991216 ) . in the case of grb000214 , for which the redshift is not known , if the feature is interpreted as an fe k fluorescence line , the implied redshift of the grb source ranges from 0.37 to 0.47 , depending on the ionization status of iron , from neutral to hydrogen  like fe , respectively .",
    "independent of the specific identification , all the detected lines point to the presence of ionized fe at the time of the afterglow measurements , with the ionizing radiation likely due to the grb flash .",
    "the line widths ( see table  [ t : tab3 ] ) are not accurately determined except in the case of the 3.5  kev line from grb991216 ( see fig .  [",
    "f : grb991216_sp ] ) . in this case",
    "the line width has been interpreted @xcite as being of kinematic origin , implying velocities of the line emitting material of @xmath103 .",
    "this velocity would also be that of the material ejected by the grb progenitor ( if a supernova ) a few months before the main grb event .",
    "the large equivalent widths of the lines favour a reflection geometry for the line emitting material @xcite . indeed , for a reflection process the ionizing flux is always efficiently reprocessed into line photons by the outermost fe layer ( optical depth @xmath104 ) , while for a transmission process an efficient re - processing of the ionizing flux would require a particular tuning of the density of both the scattering material and free electrons .",
    "the amount of fe needed mainly depends on the density of the scattering cloud and on its distance from the grb site . in the reflection model",
    "worked out by vietri et al .",
    "@xcite , the required iron mass to obtain the observed line fluxes is significant ( a sizable fraction of a solar mass in the case of grb991216 ) which is not expected even for the largest known stars .",
    "only a supernova remnant could contain so much iron .",
    "however in the model by rees and mszros @xcite , in which a continuing ( hrs to days ) power output after the burst in a magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) wind is required , it is the interaction of this wind with the walls of a funnel previously created by the grb itself ( assumed to be produced in a collapsing star ) that gives rise to the emission features .",
    "they result from a reprocessing of part of the wind luminosity by a thin layer of the funnel . in this case",
    ", the iron mass needed to obtain the line flux is much lower ( @xmath105 for grb991216 ) , thanks to the high material density and the high recombination rate of the fe ions . in this model",
    "the grb environment is not required to be enriched in fe by a previous supernova explosion . in a later paper , mszros and rees",
    "@xcite proposed a different model for the emission line in which the total amount of fe is significantly larger ( @xmath106  m@xmath107 ) . here , a hypernova progenitor releases a relativistic shock when the inner black hole is sufficiently powerful to drive the shock progress into the outlying star layers .",
    "the heated matter ( heavily contaminated by the fe nuclear matter ) , which is not accelerated to relativistic energies , expands outside the main body of the star in a cocoon and produces the fe line thermally .    in this context",
    ", the discovery of a transient absorption feature ( 13  s duration ) at 3.8 kev in the prompt emission of grb990705 @xcite could provide an important datum for settling the issue of the fe abundance and its mass and location within the environment in which the emission lines are produced .",
    "assuming that the observed absorption feature was due to a redshifted fe k  edge @xcite ( consistent with the optical redshift @xmath108 of the grb host galaxy @xcite ) , the derived fe abundance ( @xmath109 ) is typical of a supernova remnant ( snr ) and its transient nature could be a consequence of its photoionization by the grb photons . from the estimated column density ,",
    "supposing a uniform distribution of snr material , its distance from the grb site was estimated to be @xmath110  pc .",
    "such a short distance makes it very likely that the grb site was coincident with that of a supernova explosion .",
    "the time for the remnant to grow to this size was estimated as @xmath111 10  yrs .",
    "a drawback of this scenario @xcite is the huge amount of iron ( tens of solar masses ) required , unless the absorbing iron is clumped and a clump is by chance along the line of sight .",
    "lazzati et al .",
    "@xcite propose an alternative model that does not require a large fe mass . in this model",
    "the assumption is that the quasi ",
    "complete ionization of iron is achieved in a much shorter time than the duration of the feature ( 13  s ) , which is due to resonant scattering of the grb photons off h - like iron ( transition 1s-2p , @xmath112  kev ) , while its disappearance is due to a halt of the electron recombination by an electron temperature increase . in this model , to fit the data , a fe relative abundance @xmath113 times the solar value and an fe mass of @xmath114 are required . also in this model , an iron rich environment , typical of an snr , is required and the distance to the absorbing iron is low ( @xmath115  cm ) . as a consequence , independent of the specific model , a sn explosion preceding the grb event is required , which is likely to be associated with the grb event itself . in this framework",
    ", the afterglow emission features appear when the strong ionizing flux has decreased and electron recombination restarts .",
    "a peculiar property of the x - ray afterglow light curves is their very smoothly fading behaviour , except in a few cases in which an outburst ( grb 970508 ) , a flaring activity ( grb 970828 ) , and a rise from below the _ bepposax _   _ mecs _ sensitivity ( grb 981226 ) , were observed @xcite . by comparison ,",
    "the time profile of the prompt @xmath0-ray emission is erratic and even spiky . in order to explain the complex time profiles of grbs , it has been hypothesized @xcite that the grb itself could be due to internal shocks , with fast - rise exponential - decay ( fred ) events perhaps also involving external shocks @xcite ) .",
    "however , there is a general consensus that the late afterglow emission is likely due to external shocks ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the two phenomena can evolve in different ways and can involve energetics which are not necessarily correlated .",
    "it has also been suggested @xcite that the early afterglow could start already only a few tens of seconds after the burst .",
    "in fact , in a few cases like grb970228 @xcite and grb970508 @xcite , the extrapolation of the 2 - 10  kev afterglow fading law back to the time of the grb main event gives a flux consistent with that measured during the last portion of the event . using the ratio between the 2 - 10 kev fluence of the last portion of the prompt emission and that of the late afterglow , frontera et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that this property is valid also for an entire sample of grbs with known afterglows ; approximately the second half of the grb prompt x  ray emission is strictly correlated with the afterglow emission .",
    "this suggests that at least the tail of the grbs can be due to afterglow emission , while at the onset of the primary event this contribution is negligible .",
    "once the rise of the afterglow has been established , the framework of the fireball model permits the initial lorentz factor @xmath116 of the shocked ambient medium to be evaluated @xcite . from the above results @xmath117 for all grb events investigated , except for grb980425",
    "in which a much lower value ( @xmath118 ) is found @xcite .    at higher energies ( @xmath119 10  kev ) , as mentioned in section  [ s : spectrum ] , late afterglow emission has been discovered only from grb990123 with the _ bepposax _   _ pds _ instrument @xcite .",
    "however , early afterglow emission is also expected from , e.g. , electron  synchrotron self - inverse compton and proton  synchrotron processes @xcite and some evidence of a possible early , high energy afterglow has been reported @xcite .",
    "the most suggestive result is that found by giblin et al .",
    "@xcite with the strong _ batse _ event grb980923 in the 25300  kev range . the _ batse _",
    "data show a grb light curve which , after 40  s of erratically variable flux , smoothly decays with a power  law shape of index @xmath120 for about 400  s until the event becomes invisible .",
    "correspondingly , the energy spectrum shows a power  law shape with a photon index @xmath14 , which , after 40  s from the grb onset , exhibits a jump from -1 to -1.7 , which is typical of the x  ray afterglow photon indices ( see section  [ s : spectrum ] ) .",
    "in spite of the tremendous advances in the years since the discovery of the first x - ray afterglows , many questions about the grb phenomenon are still open which can only be answered with further x  ray observations .",
    "analysis of the afterglow radiation seems to indicate a synchrotron origin , but in some cases multiwavelength spectra ( see section  [ s : spectrum ] ) show the presence of an additional component in the x  ray band interpreted as electron self  inverse compton radiation .",
    "it is important to obtain good quality , multiwavelength spectra for a large sample of grbs to determine the relevant emission mechanisms of the afterglow radiation .",
    "breaks in the x  ray afterglow light curves have been observed for a few grb afterglows , while at longer wavelengths such breaks are more frequent @xcite .",
    "the jet model predicts that these breaks are achromatic if the jet propagates into a medium with uniform density .",
    "however , if the jet moves into a wind - like circumstellar environment ( @xmath121 with @xmath122 ) , the break is expected to be less relevant in x - rays than in the optical band @xcite .",
    "in addition , other models have been proposed for interpreting such breaks ( e.g. , transition to nrp , see section  [ s : time ] ) .",
    "thus it is of key importance to measure x - ray afterglow light curves with high statistical quality in order to test the jet model and to derive the ambient medium properties to be compared with the properties derived from the multiwavelength spectra .",
    "the ambient medium density , along with other grb environmental properties ( composition , velocity , temperature , metal abundance ) can also be inferred from the detection of x  ray lines or edges in the spectra of the prompt and delayed x - ray emission .",
    "this information is important for determining the nature of the grb progenitor , which is one of the most debated issues in astrophysics today . for the case of collapse of a massive progenitor",
    ", the grb environment is expected to be fe polluted and line features are more likely . on the contrary in a clean environment such as that expected for neutron star mergers ,",
    "fe lines are not likely .",
    "the x  ray lines detected so far point toward the presence of a medium highly ionized by the grb main event , with iron abundance higher than solar .",
    "it is likely that this iron is produced and ejected by the grb progenitor before the burst , which supports the hypothesis a supernova - like explosion ( hypernova , collapsar or supranova @xcite ) .",
    "however many questions are still open even in this scenario .",
    "for example :    * why do we not see any absorption feature in the prompt emission of the grbs which show an emission feature during the afterglow phase ( grb970508 or grb000214 ) ? * why are the emission lines in the afterglow spectra of grb970508 and grb970828 observed only for a limited amount of time , while in the case of grb000214 the line is stable ? * why in many other grbs observed with _ bepposax _",
    "do we not see any feature ? *",
    "is this due to the limited sensitivity of the _ bepposax _  instrumentation or is it due to an intrinsic physical process ?",
    "only more sensitive and continuous observations of grbs from the main event through to the late afterglow can answer these questions .",
    "high quality light curves of the grb prompt emission and afterglows , with no interruption , could also resolve the issue of the onset time of the afterglow emission phase , its time profile and its spectral evolution .",
    "this information is of key importance to study the feedback of the intense @xmath0ray flux on the dynamics of the fireball and on the afterglow emission properties @xcite .",
    "high quality light curves at multiple wavelengths could definitely settle the question of the rate of grbs with single or multiple broken power  law temporal behaviour .",
    "if the breaks in the light curve imply the presence of jets , the grb energetic problem could be solved , or mitigated , and ordinary supernovae could be energetic enough to be the origin of grb events @xcite .",
    "high quality light curves would also permit the study of short time variations in the afterglow fading , and thus of the degree of homogeneity of the circumburst medium @xcite .",
    "another open issue concerns the origin of short ( @xmath1231  s ) grb events . until now ,",
    "no prompt ( within few hrs ) follow - up of these events has been possible and no afterglow source has ever been identified @xcite .",
    "a claim for the detection of a transient ( 100  s duration ) and fading hard x  ray emission , obtained by summing the _ batse _ light curves of a sample of 76 short grbs has recently been reported ( see @xcite , but also @xcite ) .",
    "lazzati et al .",
    "@xcite interpret this emission as possible evidence for afterglows from short grbs .",
    "this claim still has to be confirmed by other , more sensitive observations and its origin is not clear .",
    "it could also be prompt emission from truly long grbs with have a spectrally hard , short and strong pulse at their onset , and a long tail which is not individually observable because it is below the sensitivity limit of the instrumentation used .",
    "more sensitive grb observations with immediate position identification are needed to disentangle the short grb origin issue and the afterglow properties of these events .",
    "the cause of  dark  grbs ( see also the chapter by e. pian ) is still a mystery .",
    "a possible explanation is the presence of dust in the environment around grb sites that obscures the optical emission , even if the grb output may be enough to destroy the dust in the immediate surroundings @xcite .",
    "observations of x  ray lines from these grbs could be crucial for estabilishing the environmental properties .",
    "however other possibilities can not be excluded , such as a rapid decline of the optical light or a high redshift of the object .",
    "only fast afterglow searches , starting minutes after the main event with multiple wavelength coverage of the afterglow emission , can definitely settle this issue .",
    "ray flashes detected with _ bepposax _",
    "@xcite with no @xmath0-ray counterparts are still a mystery",
    ". they could be grbs at very high redshifts ( z@xmath11910 ) or grbs with very soft spectra , or grbs from fireballs with a low lorentz factor .",
    "more sensitive observations of these events are needed .",
    "the fireball model of grbs is currently the most successful for interpreting the x  ray data .",
    "other models have been proposed , such as the cannonball ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) and only future observations will be able to distinguish between , and determine the validity of , these alternative models",
    ".    one of the major limitations of the current investigations on grb afterglows is the delay from the main event to the follow - up observations .",
    "many of the issues discussed herein will be solved when future missions , now under development ( in particular _ swift gamma - ray burst explorer _",
    "( _ swift _ ) @xcite and _ gamma - ray large area space telescope_(_glast _ ) @xcite ) are operating .",
    "_ swift _ will perform immediate ( @xmath111 1 min ) follow - up observations in the x  ray and optical bands and will trigger very prompt optical , near - infrared , and radio observations with ground - based telescopes .",
    "the @xmath0ray mission _",
    "glast _ will allow a sensitive and high time resolution study of the highest energies ( gev ) emitted by grbs and other missions , like the european _ international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory _ ( _ integral _ ) ( se , e.g. , @xcite ) and the italian _ astro - rivelatore gamma a immagini leggero _ ( _ agile _ ) @xcite are expected to make key contributions to the resolution of the grb mystery .",

    "<S> the discovery by the _ bepposax _ satellite of x - ray afterglow emission from the @xmath0-ray burst which occurred on 28 february 1997 produced a revolution in our knowledge of the @xmath0-ray burst phenomenon . along with the discovery of x - ray afterglows , </S>",
    "<S> the optical afterglows of @xmath0-ray bursts were discovered and the distance issue was settled , at least for long @xmath0-ray bursts . </S>",
    "<S> the 30 year mystery of the @xmath0-ray burst phenomenon is now on the way to solution . here </S>",
    "<S> i rewiew the observational status of the x - ray afterglow emission , its mean properties ( detection rate , continuum spectra , line features , and light curves ) , and the x - ray constraints on theoretical models of @xmath0-ray bursters and their progenitors . </S>",
    "<S> i also discuss the early onset afterglow emission , the remaining questions , and the role of future x - ray afterglow observations . </S>"
