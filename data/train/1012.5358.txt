    "the egb was first detected by the sas-2 mission @xcite , and its spectrum was measured with good accuracy by _ fermi _ ( also called isotropic diffuse background , * ? ? ?",
    "it has been found to be consistent with a featureless power law with a photon index of @xmath22.4 in the 0.2100gev energy range and an integrated flux ( e@xmath3100mev ) of 1.03@xmath4ph @xmath5 s@xmath6 sr@xmath6 .",
    "the origin of the egb is one of the fundamental unsolved problems in astrophysics , and it has been a subject of study for a long time ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the egb could originate from either truly diffuse processes or from unresolved point sources .",
    "truly diffuse emission can arise from numerous processes such as the annihilation of dark matter @xcite , particle acceleration by intergalactic shocks produced during large scale structure formation @xcite etc .",
    "blazars ( including bl lac objects , flat spectrum radio quasars , or unidentiffed flat spectrum radio sources ) represent the most numerous population detected by the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) on compton gamma ray observatory @xcite and _ fermi _ @xcite . therefore , the blazars which have not been detected by the egret or lat are the most likely candidates for the origin of the bulk of the egb emission .",
    "many authors have studied the luminosity function of blazars and showed that the contribution of blazars to the egret egb could be in the range from 20% to 100% @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , starburst galaxy and non - blazar radio loud active galactic nuclei can also contribute a fairly large fraction of the egb @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite built a source count distribution at gev energy and yielded that point sources which had not been detected by the lat can contribute 23% of the egb .",
    "at the fluxes currently reached by the lat , they ruled out the hypothesis that point - like sources ( i.e.blazars ) produce a large fraction of the egb .    however ,",
    "if the property of undetected sources is not similar to the detected sources , these conclusions maybe not correct . therefore , we apply an image stacking method to directly study the undetected point sources . for a sample of possible @xmath0-ray point sources which have not been detected by the _ fermi _ due to their faint fluxes or soft spectra @xcite , we can stack a large number of them to improve the statistics @xcite .",
    "if their fluxes are not too faint , we can derive their mean flux and photon index by maximum likelihood ( ml ) method .",
    "the at20 g @xcite is the largest catalog of high frequency radio sources and contains 5890 sources with the flux at 20ghz exceeding 40 mjy in the whole sky south of declination 0@xmath7 . in the south sky , about 60% ( 230 sources ) of _ fermi _ 1year lat agn catalogue ( 1lac ) sources are associated with the at20 g sources @xcite . through studying the correlation between the @xmath0-ray and radio flux density of at20 g sources , @xcite yielded that at20 g sources not detected by the lat can contribute 17% of the egb .",
    "therefore , we apply our methods to study them firstly .",
    "we exclude the sources identified as galactic h@xmath8 regions , galactic planetary nebulas and parts of the magellanic clouds in at20 g , then the majority of sources ( 5808 ) we obtain are quasi - stellar objects ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* but the optical properties of these objects have not been published ) . in order to minimize the influence of strong sources , we only use the sources that are at least @xmath9 away from the nearest first _",
    "fermi_-lat catalog ( 1fgl ) source and locate at high galactic latitudes , @xmath10 .",
    "finally , we obtain 2900 sources to analyze their contribution to the egb .",
    "the photons we used in our analysis are same as that used by @xcite to construct the 1fgl , but ours in the 1300gev energy range have small 68% containment radius ( better than 1@xmath7 ) and little source confusion ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this procedure , the tools of _ gtselect _ and _ gtmktime _",
    "are used .    for stacking the images of all sources ,",
    "we collect all photons that are at most @xmath11 away from any source of our sample and then record their energies ( @xmath12 , in units of gev ) and angular distances ( @xmath13 , in units of deg ) between the photon and the source .",
    "the overlaping of sources have little influence on our method because these sources are very faint and can be regard as parts of diffuse background source , especially in stacked image .",
    "after that , we apply a ml method to derive the flux and photon index of the stacked point source . for simplicity , in our model",
    "there are only two sources , e.g. the diffuse background source and stacked point source .",
    "we assume that they all have power - law spectra , and the photon indexes are @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the fluxes density are @xmath16 ( in units of [ ph @xmath5 s@xmath6 gev@xmath6 deg@xmath17 ) and @xmath18 ( in units of [ ph @xmath5 s@xmath6 gev@xmath6 ] ) , respectively .",
    "the emission can be described by @xmath20 exposure ( e),\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the photon number in the ranges of ( @xmath22@xmath23 ) and ( @xmath24@xmath25 ) , psf is the point spread function ( in the units of deg@xmath26 ) , _ exposure _ is the integral of effective area over time ( in units of [ @xmath27 s ] ) .",
    "psf and _ exposure _ are derived from the tool of _ gtpsf_. the emission must meet the relationship of @xmath28 exposure ( e ) 2\\pi\\theta d\\theta de = n_0,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the total number of photons in the @xmath30@xmath31 energy range .",
    "therefore , there are only three free parameters . in the practical calculation",
    ", we use @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath32 is the number of photons contributed by the stacked source .",
    "then @xmath16 and @xmath18 can be described by @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath32 .",
    "the probability for a photon with ( @xmath13,@xmath12 ) is @xmath33.\\ ] ] the likelihood is the probability of the observed data for a specific model . for our case",
    ", it is defined as : @xmath34 the logarithm of the likelihood is much conveniently calculated @xmath35 + \\sum_{i=1}^{n_0 } \\ln \\frac{exposure ( e_i)2\\pi\\theta_i}{n_0}.\\ ] ] because the last term is model independent , it is not useful for ml method . neglecting the last term , we get @xmath36.\\ ] ] we maximize numerically l to obtain the most probable parameters ( @xmath16 , @xmath18 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) of these sources .",
    "we use the likelihood ratio to test the hypothesis .",
    "the point source `` test statistic '' ( ts ) is defined as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the likelihood without and with point source .",
    "the detected significance of a point source is approximately @xmath40 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the stacked source is estimated to has a photon index of 2.81 and integrated flux of 1.07@xmath41ph @xmath5 s@xmath6 .",
    "the ts is 129 , corresponding to a significance of @xmath211@xmath42 .",
    "the mean flux of these sources is 3.69@xmath43ph @xmath5 s@xmath6 , it is fainter than the faintest 1fgl source by a factor of 10",
    ". it can contribute 8.4% of the egb in the 1300gev energy range .",
    "we also apply our method to a subsample of flat spectrum radio sources ( i.e. @xmath440.5 , with @xmath45 , 1780 sources ) .",
    "its photon index is 2.79 , only slightly harder than the former .",
    "its mean flux is 3.79@xmath43ph @xmath5 s@xmath6 , and the ts is 88 .",
    "this subsample has not distinct characteristic from the other sources in @xmath0-ray energy range . in order to test a more complicated spectral shape of the stacked source",
    ", we analyze the spectrum in the 110gev energy range .",
    "we expect that the spectrum would be harder in this energy range . however , the estimated photon index is 3.01 .",
    "therefore , we analyze the spectrum in 210gev , 310gev energy range , respectively . the results are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we find that the spectrum is very soft in 13gev energy range and becomes harder above 3gev .",
    "it is indicated that two types of sources exist , in which one with softer and another with harder spectrum in gev range .",
    "the former will dominate in lower energies , and latter in higher energies .",
    "therefore , the spectrum of stacked source shows very soft in the 13gev energy range . we will study this further if the optical properties of these objects can be obtained .",
    "finally we obtain the properties of the spectrum as follows . in the 13gev ,",
    "the photon index is 3.12 , the mean integrated flux is 3.89 @xmath43ph @xmath5 s@xmath6 , and the ts is 92 .",
    "obviously the flux is larger than that in the 1300gev energy range .",
    "it could be caused by that the spectrum in the 1300gev is not well fitted with a single power - law . in the 3300gev ,",
    "the photon index is 2.66 , the mean integrated flux is 3.72 @xmath46ph @xmath5 s@xmath6 , and the ts is 38 .",
    "an decrease in @xmath47 of 0.5 from its maximum value corresponds to the 68% confidence ( 1 @xmath42 ) region for each parameter ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we use this variance to estimate the error of each parameter . in three parameters ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath32 )",
    ", we take two ones to be the values with maximal likelihood , and allow third one to change around its best value , we then test the deviation of @xmath47 from its maximum value shown in figure 1 .",
    "the 1 @xmath42 errors of @xmath15 are 0.25 and 0.22 , the ones of @xmath32 are 270 and 53 , in 13 and 3300gev respectively",
    ". the 1 @xmath42 relative errors of fluxes are 10.5 % and 17.3 % , in 13 and 3300gev .    in order to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of our method , we do the monte carlo ( mc ) simulations using the tool _ gtobssim_. the simulating time",
    "is 26ms , equaling to the time of real data we used .",
    "we simulate the galactic and isotropic diffuse backgrounds using the models ( e.  g. gll_iem_v02.fit , isotropic_iem_v02.txt ) recommended by the lat team , in which 3913 sources are generated each time , but only 2900 sources isotropically distribute on the sky with @xmath10 .",
    "we complete one thousand mc simulations in 13 and 3300gev energy range using the obtained parameters .",
    "the diffuse source is simulated only once due to long run time , but its effect on the result is not remarkable because the source is random distribution and its photons are various .",
    "the distributions of the photon index , flux and ts for different energy ranges are shown in figure 2 .",
    "they are compatible with gaussian distributions . in the 13 and 3300 gev ,",
    "the mean fluxes are 4.30 and 0.364 ( in the unit of [ @xmath48ph @xmath5 s@xmath6 ] ) , their relative errors are 10.3% and 20.7% ; the photon indexes are 3.15 and 2.71 with the errors of 0.23 and 0.26 .",
    "the errors estimated here are similar to that found in the fourth paragraph . comparing the input parameters , we find that the systematic errors occur , especially for the flux in the 13gev energy range",
    ". they could be caused by that diffuse background source can not be described by a single power - law spectrum .    because the mc method can obtain the systematic errors",
    ", we use this method to correct our results as follows : in the 13 and 3300gev , the fluxes are 3.48@xmath10.36 and 0.380@xmath10.080 ( in unit of [ @xmath48ph @xmath5 s@xmath6 ] ) , and the photon indexes are 3.09@xmath10.23 and 2.61@xmath1 0.26 respectively , while the contribution to the egb is ( 10.5@xmath11.1)% and ( 4.3@xmath10.9)% , which are much smaller than the result ( 17% ) of @xcite .",
    "if the soft spectrum in 13gev is caused by the spectral broken of some sources , the photon index would not be extrapolated to lower energy range . however , as long as the spectrum of stacked source is not harder than the egb , the contribution to the egb in 0.11gev will be larger than that in 13gev .",
    "our result is compatible with the result ( 23% ) of @xcite because other point sources could contribute to the egb .    in this letter",
    ", we introduce a new method of images stacking to directly study the contribution of undetected point sources to the egb .",
    "our method is more direct than the methods used by many authors .",
    "those methods involve the @xmath0-ray luminosity of undetected sources which is estimated through the properties of a few detected sources .",
    "they include many uncertainties and lead the result to be questionable validity .    applying our method",
    ", we find that the undetected sources in at20 g can contribute ( 10.5@xmath11.1)% and ( 4.3@xmath10.9)% to the egb in the 13 and 3300gev energy range respectively .",
    "their @xmath0-ray spectrum is very soft , implying that the emissive property is different for undetected and detected sources .",
    "applying our method to estimate the contribution of all point sources to the egb , we need a complete sample of possible @xmath0-ray point sources which is not easily constructed . in this letter",
    ", we only estimate the contribution of ag20 g to the egb . we will study more samples of possible @xmath0-ray point sources in the future .",
