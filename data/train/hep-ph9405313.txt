    "there is strong evidence to suggest that the three gauge couplings of the strong , electromagnetic and weak interactions are unified at a high energy scale in a single gauge interaction based on a simple group , such as su(5 ) or so(10 ) , as long as the desert below the unification scale is described by the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( the mssm ) .",
    "furthermore , the combination of supersymmetry ( susy ) and grand unification yields models with numerous attractive features : the embedding of the standard - model matter multiplets into a few irreducible representations of the gut group , the technically natural preservation of a hierarchy between the weak and gut scales , a longer proton lifetime to allow agreement with current experimental lower bounds , the correct prediction of the ratio of @xmath2 quark to @xmath3 lepton masses , simple anstze for the remaining fermion masses , and a picturesque scenario for radiative electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "we have chosen , therefore , to look beyond the gauge unification prediction of the weak mixing angle and examine the unification of third - family yukawa couplings @xcite , for the most part within its natural context of so(10 ) unification .",
    "by yukawa couplings we mean the couplings of the top , bottom and tau to the higgs doublets which generate their masses when electroweak symmetry is broken .",
    "the third family is singled out because of its relatively large yukawa couplings : it seems reasonable to suppose that they arise at tree - level from the simplest interactions , while the masses and mixings of the other generations require more complex , perhaps also higher - order and certainly very model - dependent structures .",
    "our study also applies more generally to scenarios in which these yukawa couplings are unified but not in the context of an so(10 ) gut , or even models in which the yukawas are only comparable near the gut or planck scales .",
    "we begin by considering the most immediate prediction of this yukawa unification , namely the top quark mass @xcite .",
    "however , we are quickly led to consider in some depth the more general question of how the top - bottom mass hierarchy could be generated in the mssm , and how this hierarchy depends on the initial conditions of the renormalization group ( rg ) evolution at the gut scale @xcite",
    ". we will conclude with a discussion of how natural ( or unnatural ! ) such a hierarchy seems in this context , what its other phenomenological predictions might be , and how one could hope to improve the theoretical picture or obtain experimental corroboration .",
    "one consequence of yukawa unification is immediate , and independent of other assumptions except for the qualitative nature of the rg evolution equations of the mssm .",
    "since the yukawa couplings of the top and bottom quarks ( and the @xmath3 lepton ) are always comparable , the large ratio of the top mass versus the bottom ( or tau ) mass must be due to a large ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) which give rise to their masses .",
    "namely , since the up - type and down - type matter fermion masses arise from couplings to the up - type and down - type higgs multiplets ( @xmath4 ) , respectively , the large ratio @xmath5 is not a consequence of a large ratio of yukawas @xmath6 but rather of large @xmath7 .",
    "thus yukawa unification generically implies @xmath8 .",
    "further assumptions are necessary to make any precise predictions",
    ". we will assume the following three throughout most of this work , although we will point out those conclusions which are more general :    1 .",
    "the masses of the third generation , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , originate from renormalizable yukawa couplings of the form @xmath12 in a supersymmetric gut with a gauge group containing ( the conventional ) so(10 ) ; @xmath13 denotes the 16-dimensional spinor representation of so(10 ) containing the third - generation standard - model fermions ( plus the right - handed neutrino which we assume to be superheavy ) and their superpartners .",
    "2 .   the evolution of the gauge and yukawa couplings in the effective theory beneath the so(10 ) breaking scale is described by the rg equations of the mssm .",
    "the two higgs doublets lie predominantly in a single irreducible multiplet of so(10 ) .",
    "the first and third assumptions serve to define what we mean by yukawa unification , while the second allows us to relate this gut - scale unification to weak - scale observables . from ( i ) and ( iii ) it follows that the third - generation yukawas must arise from either a @xmath14 or a @xmath15 interaction with an so(10 ) higgs multiplet .",
    "the latter leads to the boundary conditions @xmath16 at the gut scale , but the resulting ratio of @xmath17 at low energies is far too low to be consistent with experiment ( at least within the perturbative regime , and unless very large threshold corrections to the @xmath2 mass arise at low energies @xcite ) .",
    "thus we are restricted to using the @xmath18 , and hence the boundary condition @xmath19 with this boundary condition , and using the unification of gauge couplings to fix the unification scale and the gauge coupling at that scale , we can now evolve the yukawa couplings down to the weak scale for any given value of @xmath20 .",
    "the idea is that the three observable masses @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are functions of the four parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are in turn determined by the unification in terms of @xmath20 and the gut scale @xmath26 .",
    "since the latter is already known from gauge unification , we are left with three observable masses as functions of only two parameters , @xmath20 and @xmath24 .",
    "thus we use two observables , @xmath10 and @xmath11 to fix @xmath20 and @xmath24 , and thereby predict the third observable @xmath9 . a detailed analysis of the rg evolution , and the consequent predictions ,",
    "has already been presented @xcite .",
    "the results , namely the values of @xmath25 and the ratio @xmath27 all at the weak scale , are plotted in fig .  1 as functions of @xmath20 .",
    "( these curves actually use 2-loop rg evolution , but at this point the difference between 1- and 2-loop equations is not important .",
    "for the final predictions of @xmath9 we use the full 2-loop evolution and 1-loop matching conditions . ) evidently , larger @xmath20 values correspond to a heavy top and to a smaller @xmath28 ratio .",
    "the experimental value @xmath29 is found @xcite  from the qcd sum rules value and is evolved to the weak scale using 2-loop qcd running .",
    "we find , allowing for @xmath30 to vary between roughly 0.11 and 0.12 , the shaded range shown in fig .  1 .",
    "thus , in the absence of any large corrections in the matching between the @xmath28 evolved down from the gut scale and the @xmath31 in the standard model , we find @xmath32 , which implies a heavy top .",
    "140 160 700 500floridafig1.ps133",
    "for a precise prediction , 2-loop rg equations must be used along with 1-loop matching functions .",
    "these matching functions include logarithmic corrections from infinite counterterms as well as nonlogarithmic contributions from finite graphs .",
    "the former are given elsewhere @xcite ; they are generally quite small , and invariably increase the top mass as the superpartner masses increase .",
    "the latter are more interesting , since they can be very large @xcite .",
    "the dominant corrections arise from the graphs of fig .  2 , which match the value of the @xmath2 mass as evolved down from the gut scale to the value in the low - energy theory . typically the gluino graph dominates , yielding a corrected value @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the gluino mass while @xmath37 is the mass of the heaviest superpartner in the loop ( more exact expressions may be found in our previous work ) .",
    "the important observation here is that the bottom mass gets a large contribution from the up - type higgs at 1-loop order , whereas its tree - level mass was small due to the small vev of the down - type higgs . in the usual scenario with small @xmath24 ,",
    "the bottom was light because its yukawa coupling was small , or in other words because it was protected by an approximate chiral symmetry .",
    "thus any higher - order corrections would also be suppressed by this approximate symmetry . in the large @xmath24 scenario",
    "these corrections are not suppressed : there is an enhancement of @xmath38 , which overcomes the usual @xmath39 loop factor to give a correction of order 1 to the @xmath2 mass  at least if @xmath40 .",
    "phenomenologically , the result is that @xmath10 can not be predicted with any certainty unless we know something about the superspectrum , and if @xmath10 is uncertain then so is the top mass prediction .",
    "140 440 700 680floridafig2.ps2 42    in fig .",
    "3 we show the top pole mass prediction , now to full 2-loop order , as a function of the @xmath41 running parameter @xmath42 in two cases .",
    "the top curves and the higher horizontal axis correspond to a hierarchical spectrum , in which the squarks are heavy whereas the @xmath43 parameter and gaugino masses are light",
    ". then the corrections @xmath44 are small and the top mass is predicted to be above 180 gev or so .",
    "the bottom curves and the lower horizontal axis correspond to a roughly degenerate spectrum in which the corrections to the @xmath2 mass are @xmath45 and negative ( i.e. @xmath28 should be lowered by 25% in fig .  1 before matching to the experimental value ) .",
    "now the top can be significantly lighter .",
    "in fact , this last argument can be turned around : if the threshold corrections are too large in magnitude and negative then the top mass prediction will be below the experimental lower bound , while if they are large and positive then no value of @xmath20 will allow agreement with @xmath31 .",
    "we thus find the following bounds on the superspectrum : if @xmath20 is allowed to vary , then @xmath46 whereas for fixed @xmath20 the appropriate limits can be read from fig .",
    "1 .    150 180 650 600floridafig3.ps3 54",
    "do we have any experimental information about these corrections ?",
    "of course we have no direct evidence of any of the superpartners , but we can appeal to their indirect appearance in loop diagrams . consider again the diagrams of fig .  2 , but with one of the @xmath2 quarks replaced by a strange quark using a flavor - changing vertex , and with a photon attached in all possible ways .",
    "we see that the same processes will lead to a contribution to the rare decay @xmath1 , and with a similar enhancement of @xmath47 over the usual mssm scenario @xcite .",
    "the dependence of these diagrams on the superpartner masses is somewhat similar to that of @xmath48 , except that ( a ) now the operator is of higher dimension and so is suppressed by the mass of the heaviest superpartner , and ( b ) typically the higgsino - mediated diagram dominates .",
    "if the parameters appearing in this higgsino diagram , namely @xmath43 , @xmath0 ( the trilinear soft susy - breaking parameter ) and the squark masses , are all comparable and of order the z mass , then this diagram gives a contribution to the amplitude for @xmath1 many times bigger than the standard model or the usual mssm amplitudes , and is clearly ruled out by the cleo limit @xcite . to restore agreement with experiment , either the overall superpartner mass scale must be raised far above the electroweak scale , or else @xmath43 or @xmath0 or both must be suppressed relative to the squark mass in the loop .",
    "more quantitatively , we find that either the masses must all be raised to at least @xmath49 , or else if both @xmath43 and @xmath0 are near the z mass then the squarks must be above either @xmath50 gev or @xmath51 gev , depending on whether these diagrams interfere destructively or constructively with the 2-higgs standard model amplitudes . in any case",
    ", however , these restrictions do not yet tell us anything about the combination @xmath52 which appears in @xmath44 ; the link between these two will be forged below , when we study the evolution of the entire set of mssm parameters .",
    "we have assumed in the above that the top - bottom mass hierarchy would arise from a hierarchy of vevs in the higgs spectrum , namely @xmath53 .",
    "we now consider how such a hierarchy could be generated in the mssm .",
    "clearly this question is of interest for any model in which the yukawas themselves do not supply a sufficient hierarchy to explain the large ratio of third - generation quark masses , not just for the equal - yukawas case to which we have specialized . in studying this question",
    ", however , we will pay attention to which spectra are favored by large @xmath24 scenarios , and whether with such spectra and our unification assumptions we can pin down the top mass prediction .",
    "the scalar potential of the neutral higgs bosons which leads to electroweak symmetry breaking is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 contain the soft - breaking masses and the @xmath43 parameter in the superpotential , @xmath56 is a soft - breaking mass parameter , and the quartic terms arise from d - terms and so are given by gauge couplings .",
    "we will evolve these parameters from the gut to the weak scale using the 1-loop rg equations of the mssm , stopping the evolution at some typical scale ( of order the squark masses ) which minimizes the effects of higher - order corrections .",
    "the subscript 0 indicates that we will restrict our attention to this ( rg - improved ) tree - level potential rather than calculate the full 1-loop effective potential or , better yet , explicitly integrate out massive particles and consider full 1-loop matching conditions .",
    "we expect @xcite  that our qualitative discussion of the radiative symmetry breaking will not be jeopardized by this simplification .",
    "that is , a more complete calculation will change the numerical values of the gut parameters needed for correctly breaking the symmetry , but will not significantly alter the size of the domains in parameter space where such breaking is achieved .",
    "the conditions for this breaking are well - known : @xmath57 ensures that the potential is bounded from below , and @xmath58 guarantees the existence of a minimum away from the origin and so breaks the symmetry . in practice ,",
    "since @xmath59 will always be much less than or at most comparable to @xmath60 and @xmath61 , we can reduce these requirements to @xmath62 ( using the expression for the pseudoscalar higgs mass ) and @xmath63 ( noting that large @xmath24 means that the up - type higgs gets the large vev ) .    in the usual  and very attractive  scenario of radiative breaking , the two mass parameters start out at the gut scale with a universal positive value : @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the soft - breaking mass of the @xmath18 of higgs in so(10 ) , or of the @xmath66 and @xmath67 in su(5 ) . thus the symmetry is not broken at that scale . however , in the rg evolution to the electroweak scale , the large yukawa coupling of the top quark to @xmath68 , which gives the top its mass , also drives the mass - squared parameter @xmath69 of @xmath68 negative ( with the help of the qcd coupling ) , while the absence of a large yukawa in the down sector keeps the mass - squared of @xmath70 positive . in fact , conditions ( [ eq : bndbel ] ) and ( [ eq : ewsb ] ) are easily satisfied for a large range of initial conditions if @xmath71 , resulting in a very natural picture of radiative symmetry breaking .",
    "this picture is essentially lost in the large @xmath24 scenario , for the following two reasons :    1 .   since both yukawas are comparable [ and in fact initially equal in the so(10 )",
    "case ] , the two higgs doublets tend to run in the same way , so either both stay positive at the electroweak scale and the symmetry does not break , or both become negative and the potential becomes unbounded from below ( a situation which breaks the symmetry but in a coleman - weinberg fashion , yielding an `` electroweak scale '' orders of magnitude higher than the susy - breaking scale ) . the effects which differentiate the evolution of the two higgs doublets , namely hypercharge and the absence of a right - handed neutrino , are small and a poor replacement for the usual @xmath72 splitting .",
    "interestingly , an @xmath73 splitting between @xmath21 and @xmath74 is still of little use since it is quickly diminished by the fixed - point behavior of these couplings .",
    "( some of these observation have been previously made by t.  banks @xcite . ) 2 .",
    "even when electroweak symmetry is broken , a large hierarchy of vevs must be generated between the two similarly - evolving higgs doublets .",
    "minimizing the potential @xmath75 when @xmath76 yields + @xmath77 + and @xmath78 the first equation sets the scale , but from the second equation we see that a large hierarchy in vevs requires the large hierarchy @xmath79 .",
    "this , as we show below , implies a degree of fine - tuning between some parameters in the lagrangian .",
    "before analyzing the implications of these two criticisms , we present the 1-loop solutions @xcite  of the rg equations for the mssm mass parameters , integrated between @xmath80 and a typical squark mass of 300 gev .",
    "( none of our results is sensitive to the exact values of these starting and stopping scales . )",
    "the solutions depend on the dimensionless initial values of the gauge and yukawa couplings @xmath81 and @xmath20 and on the dimensionful gut - scale parameters @xmath82 , @xmath65 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath82 and @xmath65 are the soft - breaking masses of the @xmath18 and the @xmath13 respectively , and @xmath87 will be explained below ; we note for now that it vanishes for universal soft - breaking masses . whenever possible , capital letters denote values at the gut scale .",
    "the rg equations themselves are well - known and will not be presented here .",
    "these equations dictate that the low - energy values of the various mass parameters depend very simply on the dimensionful initial values , with coefficients that depend only on the dimensionless ones .",
    "since @xmath81 is known from gauge unification , these coefficients depend only on @xmath20 . for the representative value @xmath88 , the solutions are : @xmath89 here @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the squark and slepton doublets , respectively , and @xmath92 , @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "are the su(2)-singlet squarks and sleptons . for clarity of presentation ,",
    "we have dropped from the first 7 expressions above the terms proportional to @xmath93 and to @xmath94 , since their coefficients are small enough [ @xmath95 and exhibit sufficiently small custodial - su(2 ) breaking to be negligible for purposes of symmetry - breaking , at least if @xmath85 is not very much larger than the other mass parameters .",
    "we have also used the low - energy value of @xmath43 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mu]-[eq : ma ] ) .",
    "these solutions are useful references for the discussions below .",
    "these solutions can also be combined @xcite  with the more analytic approach briefly described in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : expsol ] ) to give a complete , semi - analytic solution to the rg equations when custodial su(2 ) is an approximate symmetry .",
    "to understand the second criticism above , let us examine in more detail how eq .",
    "( [ eq : tanbet ] ) may be satisfied .",
    "we concentrate for the moment on six relevant electroweak - scale parameters : the up- and down - type higgs masses @xmath96 and @xmath97 , a typical squark mass @xmath98 , the @xmath56 parameter in the scalar potential , a gaugino mass ( specifically the wino mass ) @xmath99 , and the @xmath43 parameter .",
    "this last one may be set to zero by imposing a peccei - quinn symmetry on the lagrangian , so the size of @xmath43 measures the breaking of this @xmath100 symmetry ; consequently , @xmath43 is multiplicatively renormalized .",
    "the previous two , @xmath56 and @xmath99 , along with the @xmath0 parameter , transform in the same way under a continuous @xmath101 symmetry ( so they enter into each other s rg equations ) and may be made arbitrarily small by imposing this @xmath101 symmetry . with these two symmetries in mind @xcite , we consider three possible spectra having splittings which lead to a large @xmath24 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : tanbet ] ) :    [ cols=\">,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the @xmath102 and @xmath103 are examples of extra superheavy higgs representations which are typically added in order to break this @xmath104 ( in this case by acquiring vevs in the `` @xmath105 '' direction ) and reduce the rank of the group . as usual , the spontaneous breakdown of a u(1 ) leads to a vev for its d - term , which can induce masses for the various fields which appear in this d - term .",
    "in particular , _",
    "if we do not assume universal soft - breaking masses _ for all scalars , then the soft - breaking masses of the @xmath102 and @xmath103 need not be equal , and therefore their vevs are also split , in proportion to their mass splitting .",
    "this splitting in turn generates a mass splitting in the low - energy mssm lagrangian through the cross - term : @xmath106 in fact , this mechanism splits any fields which have different charges under @xmath104 .",
    "thus the boundary conditions for the scalar masses at the gut scale become @xmath107 where the capital letters on the left - hand side serve as reminders that these are the values at the gut scale , and @xmath108 is a new soft - breaking mass parameter in the low - energy theory . with this mass",
    "we no longer need rely on large gaugino masses to split the higgs doublets : they can start out being different , and thus even with parallel evolution the symmetry - breaking conditions ( [ eq : bndbel][eq : ewsb ] ) can apparently be satisfied .",
    "one problem with this mechanism is evident from the initial conditions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : initcond ] ) : not just the higgs doublets but also the squarks and sleptons are split , so an excessively large @xmath109 could lower @xmath110 or @xmath111 sufficiently to make @xmath112 or @xmath113 negative at the electroweak scale , thereby spontaneously breaking the strong or electromagnetic gauge symmetries .",
    "if rg effects were irrelevant , namely for small @xmath20 , then @xmath82 could always be raised enough to prevent this without affecting @xmath114 . however , for @xmath71 the squark masses strongly affect the evolution of the higgs doublets [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mu]-[eq : ma ] ) ] , and only for very constrained ranges of the initial parameters can the electroweak symmetry , and only that symmetry , be spontaneously broken at a reasonable scale .",
    "in fact , as we show in brief below , there is a focusing effect that is inherent in the mssm rg equations when @xmath115 , and which inevitably requires an adjustment of the gut - scale parameters beyond the @xmath116 level derived above .",
    "we first show this behavior of the rg equations for completely general initial conditions , and then return to discuss the specific case of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : initcond ] ) .",
    "consider the rg equations of the mssm in the limit of exact @xmath117 and @xmath101 symmetries , in which @xmath118 at all scales . for future reference",
    ", we call this scenario _ the maximally symmetric case_. this limit is interesting for two reasons : first , no large corrections arise to the @xmath2 quark mass , and the @xmath119 prediction for all values of @xmath120 falls nicely within the range allowed by experiment ( see fig .",
    "1 ) ; in other words , a heavy top quark near its fixed - point mass favors small @xmath44 .",
    "second , as we saw above , having a large @xmath43 and @xmath99 calls for fine - tuning @xmath56 ( or some equivalent adjustment ) , so we d like to explore the opposite limit to see whether a more natural scenario can be achieved . of course , eventually we must relax this limit to agree with lep bounds , but the qualitative behavior we shall discover will persist . if we further approximate @xmath121 and neglect the sleptonic contributions ( thereby restoring custodial symmetry ) , the rg solutions simplify considerably .",
    "there are now five relevant parameters . in terms of their initial conditions at the gut scale , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath110 , the solutions at the electroweak scale are : @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 ( note again the use of capital letters to denote gut - scale initial parameters , and recall that @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath90 , @xmath92 and @xmath2 refer to the up - type higgs , the down - type higgs , the su(2)-doublet third - generation squarks , the su(2)-singlet stop and the su(2)-singlet sbottom , respectively . )    evidently , two linear combinations of masses , labeled by @xmath131 and @xmath132 at the gut scale , renormalize multiplicatively and exponentially contract at low energies for @xmath71 .",
    "the three other linear combinations , @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 , are invariant .",
    "the important observation here is that in the first contraction  the sum rule @xmath136the coefficient of every term is positive , while we already know that each mass - squared itself must be positive for a proper electroweak - breaking scenario .",
    "therefore each term by itself must be small , less than @xmath137 .",
    "this can only happen if the various combinations of invariants ( and possibly also @xmath138 ) in the expressions ( [ eq : expsol ] ) for these terms are adjusted to be small relative to @xmath131 .",
    "the exact constraints that follow from this requirement are given explicitly elsewhere @xcite .",
    "they are of the form @xmath139 .",
    "we learn that , for @xmath71 where this focusing effect is important , any given model for the gut - scale soft - breaking masses must either provide an explanation of why each invariant should be small relative to the sum @xmath140 , or else that invariant must be tuned by hand to be small .",
    "we also learn that the conditions for successful symmetry - breaking are sensitive to any other small effects .",
    "one such effect is custodial symmetry violation , which is parametrized above by @xmath141 and results from hypercharge and @xmath23 ( or the absence of @xmath105 ) . in the running of the yukawas , both of these cause @xmath21 to slightly exceed @xmath22 , and thus drive @xmath96 below @xmath97 , as in the conventional scenario of electroweak symmetry breaking . in the running of the masses ,",
    "the contributions of the @xmath3 yukawa have an opposite and numerically more relevant impact .",
    "therefore the custodial - breaking effects make it harder to break the symmetry correctly  significantly harder in the specialized case discussed below . in any realistic scenario",
    "there are also contributions from the gauginos and @xmath43 , so in the end the sum rule , and therefore the general limit which must be set on @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 , takes the form @xmath142",
    "m_s^2 \\label{eq : sumrul}\\ ] ] where @xmath143 is the largest mass parameter in the initial conditions at the gut scale .",
    "if we now return to the more specialized boundary conditions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : initcond ] ) , we find ( after setting @xmath144 ) : @xmath145 for this choice of boundary conditions , keeping the invariants small imposes only two requirements : @xmath146 and small @xmath87 .",
    "the upper bound on the invariants involves both @xmath147 and @xmath141 , and as we hinted above they partially cancel in the combination @xmath148 which enters into the requirements : @xmath149 , is particularly sensitive to this cancellation@xcite . ) the first requirement , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mhmsq ] ) , entails a definite tuning of parameters to a precision of @xmath148 , which does not apparently follow from any symmetry .",
    "note that without this requirement , either color breaks when @xmath150 or a coleman - weinberg mechanism operates when @xmath151 .",
    "the requirement of small @xmath87 may on the other hand be natural , since [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : mx ] ) ] the value of @xmath109 is smaller by an order of magnitude than the soft - breaking masses whose splitting generates the d - terms , and those masses may be expected to be comparable to @xmath82 and @xmath65 . in any case , we see that because of the focusing effect of the rg equations , the d - terms can not be _ allowed _ to induce splittings bigger than those we already had through custodial su(2)-breaking effects . hence they do not eliminate the criticism that the electroweak symmetry is hard to break when the yukawas are comparable .",
    "but there is still a significant advantage in using these d - terms , since they can now substitute for large values of @xmath99 and @xmath43 , and with light gauginos and @xmath43 it is much easier to obtain a large @xmath24 , according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tanbet ] ) and ( [ eq : btune ] ) .",

    "constructively _ with the usual 2-higgs standard model amplitude , and vice - versa . on one hand , we see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : muglimits ] ) or from fig .  1 , that the bounds on @xmath44 are more severe when @xmath157 .",
    "on the other hand , as noted above , when @xmath156 the interference is constructive and the bounds on the large @xmath1 graphs are stricter .",
    "thus these two bounds are much stronger when taken together , and translate into the following statement : either ( a ) the gauginos or @xmath43 or both are significantly lighter than the squarks , or ( b ) the superpartners are much heavier than the z.",
    "with these remarks in mind , we first examine the popular @xcite  case of universal soft - breaking masses .",
    "this scenario has also been recently studied in some detail by carena et al .  @xcite .",
    "if all soft - breaking scalar masses are equal then the d - term contributions vanish ( @xmath158 ) , and we are left with the three parameters @xmath43 , @xmath84 and @xmath159 , in addition to @xmath86 which is adjusted at the end to obtain the correct @xmath24 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : tanbet ] ) ] .",
    "we have already mentioned that in this case we need @xmath43 comparable to @xmath84 , and both at least as big as @xmath160 , to break electroweak symmetry correctly . we have also seen that these three parameters must be tuned in order to obtain a positive @xmath161 and @xmath162 : @xmath163 next , to achieve a hierarchy of higgs vevs , @xmath86 must be adjusted very precisely such that , at low energies , @xmath164 finally , since @xmath43 and the gauginos are not lighter than the squarks , @xmath44 is rather large , and so must be negative , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : muglimits ] ) or from fig .  1 .",
    "hence the @xmath165 constraint is strong , necessitating large superpartner masses of at least @xmath166 and therefore a _ further _ tuning ( by roughly another order of magnitude ) of the three parameters to achieve correct electroweak breaking .",
    "of course , such a highly - tuned scenario is also highly predictive : for example , the spectrum is highly constrained , and the top mass is predicted by the large @xmath44 corrections to be light .    in search of a more natural scenario ,",
    "we next relax the assumption of universal soft - breaking masses , which was perhaps arbitrary to begin with .",
    "we begin with the maximally symmetric scenario studied previously ( see also scenario c above ) , in which @xmath167 so that the @xmath100 and @xmath101 symmetries are approximately obeyed .",
    "since this hierarchy directly implies a small @xmath44 and therefore ( from fig .",
    "1 ) a relatively large @xmath20 , the focusing effect of eq .",
    "( [ eq : epsl ] ) takes its toll , and once again the initial parameters  this time @xmath82 , @xmath65 , and @xmath87must be adjusted to at least @xmath168 $ ] .",
    "then , to truly get a maximally symmetric scenario , we choose to obtain a large @xmath24 not by tuning to get a small @xmath56 but rather by ( equivalently ) tuning to get a small @xmath169 , which then allows small @xmath43 and @xmath99 relative to the typical low - energy soft - breaking masses and therefore establishes approximate @xmath100 and @xmath101 symmetries even at the electroweak scale : @xmath170 where @xmath171 . after this adjustment ,",
    "large @xmath24 is automatic : @xmath172 and no further adjustment is necessary to suppress @xmath165 since @xmath43 and @xmath84 are small .",
    "so this scenario requires much less adjusting than the universal case , although more than just the inevitable @xmath116 tuning .",
    "( the actual tuning needed is in reality slightly more than indicated , due to the squark- and slepton - splittings induced by the d - terms and due to the effects of custodial symmetry violation , as mentioned above ; qualitatively , though , the picture we described remains . )",
    "it is also predictive : the superspectrum is hierarchical with light charginos and neutralinos but heavy squarks , and since @xmath20 is large so is the top mass .",
    "we can continuously retreat from this maximally symmetric case by increasing @xmath43 or @xmath84 ( or the related parameters ) , thereby losing @xmath100 or @xmath101 , first at low energies when @xmath43 or @xmath99 become comparable to @xmath173 , and then at all energies when @xmath43 or @xmath99 become comparable to @xmath143 itself .",
    "both may be interesting for model - building ( for example , if @xmath43 is radiatively generated by @xmath0 terms at the gut scale , then @xmath100 rather than @xmath101 symmetry should be evident ) and for comparison with experiments once the superspectrum is measured .",
    "in either case , the tuning is comparable to the maximally symmetric case , though less tuning is needed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sfta ] ) and more in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sftb ] ) . we will however defer their discussion to our more complete study @xcite , and instead consider the case where _ both _ @xmath100 and @xmath101",
    "symmetries are abandoned in favor of a smaller @xmath20 .",
    "we will call this scenario , unimaginatively , the asymmetric case .",
    "it alleviates the focusing effect of eq .",
    "( [ eq : epsl ] ) since now @xmath174 , which in turn allows the initial conditions ( specifically the d - terms ) to split the higgs doublets and the other multiplets by a large amount , so now @xmath175",
    ". small @xmath20 also entails larger ( negative ) @xmath44 corrections to correctly predict @xmath17 , and to this end we take @xmath176 .",
    "we then see , however , that what we gain by eliminating the focusing effect we lose by restoring the @xmath165 problem : since @xmath43 and @xmath99 are no longer small , we are forced to raise the susy scale to @xmath177 , and therefore again to tune the initial parameters to make the z light : @xmath178 since the d - term splitting of the higgs is now large , @xmath179 , we find that @xmath86 requires only the typical tuning @xmath180 this scenario is comparable in its naturalness ( or lack thereof ) to the symmetric case . the superspectrum is uniformly heavy rather than hierarchical , and the top is light since @xmath20 is small .",
    "these last two scenarios are qualitatively the best one can hope for from an so(10 ) model with yukawa unification , for two reasons .",
    "first , obtaining a large @xmath24 and thereby the top - bottom hierarchy is never natural in the mssm , due to the lep bounds on @xmath43 and @xmath99 which force either @xmath162 to be much heavier than the z or @xmath56 to be much lighter than the gauginos .",
    "second , the last two scenarios illustrate how , for large @xmath20 , the _ inherent _ focusing property of the rg equations in the symmetric limit necessitates a further tuning of the initial parameters , while for small @xmath20 a similar tuning is mandated by bounds on the rate of @xmath1 .",
    "there are also intermediate scenarios , with only one of the symmetries , but they are apparently no more natural .",
    "these various possibilities are considered in more detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the universal case is generically much more tuned than most of these scenarios , as we have shown .",
    "hence departures from universality , although possibly dangerous for the flavor - changing neutral current interactions they can induce in some models , are strongly favored in achieving a large @xmath24 .    what is the status of the predictions ?",
    "perhaps surprisingly , the top mass is not an independent prediction of yukawa unification , but rather depends strongly ( i.e. non - logarithmically ) on a certain ratio of superpartner masses appearing in @xmath44 . since the large- and small-@xmath20 cases are equally fine - tuned , naturalness arguments do not single out any particular top mass within this so(10 ) framework . instead , information about the top mass can be combined with fig .  1 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : delmb ] ) to restrict the mass parameters which can be consistent with yukawa unification , and to determine a favored superspectrum .",
    "it must be admitted that , with yukawa unification , the attractive conventional picture of _ radiative _ electroweak symmetry breaking due to a large @xmath21 but small @xmath22 is largely lost : the symmetry is either broken radiatively using small custodial isospin - violating effects and extraordinarily fine - tuned initial conditions , or else the higgs doublets are already split at the gut scale .",
    "furthermore , we have seen that all the large @xmath24 scenarios are technically unnatural . on the other hand",
    "( and to some extent because of the necessary fine - tuning ) , they are certainly predictive and so will be tested in future accelerators : for example , if the charginos are light but the squarks are heavy , the top should also be heavy ; if the @xmath181-singlet bottom squark or the doublet sleptons were lighter than the other squarks and sleptons , this would be a sign that the d - term splittings were large @xcite ; and finally , @xmath24 can itself eventually be measured to decisively confirm or dismiss the large @xmath24 hypothesis .",
    "even before any further experimental input , there are a few theoretical avenues worth pursuing which would make yukawa unification much more attractive .",
    "first , as discussed also by j.  lykken in these proceedings @xcite , string models which lead to true grand - unified models as their low - energy effective lagrangians can exhibit higher symmetries in certain sectors of the gut than in other sectors .",
    "in particular , a string theory with an so(10 ) gauge symmetry might break to an effective low - energy su(5 ) gut in a stringy way , leaving _ all three _",
    "yukawa couplings unified at the planck scale  la so(10 ) but splitting the @xmath66 from the @xmath67 soft masses , namely @xmath122 from @xmath123 .",
    "note that unlike the d - term splittings we have considered before , @xmath122 and @xmath123 could now be split without necessarily decreasing some squark or slepton masses .",
    "this approach can thus provide more freedom in the choice of boundary conditions  although as we have shown , some features of the rg equations , in particular the focusing effect , are inherent in the equations themselves in certain limits and apply to any boundary conditions , so that freedom could either be the key to a more natural scenario ( see the following remark ) or could necessitate still more arbitrary fine - tunings at the gut scale .",
    "second , we have shown that in the symmetric case with large @xmath20 , the ratio of the soft - breaking masses for the @xmath18 and the @xmath13 needs to have a certain value if the electroweak symmetry is to break correctly . while such a value is arbitrary in the context of an so(10 ) model and",
    "therefore apparently requires a fine - tuning , perhaps this value could be explained as a ratio of integral conformal weights in the context of a string theory into which the gut is embedded .",
    "( notice that this value is favored simply by the unification of yukawas at some large scale , and does not depend on an so(10 ) symmetry . ) if such an explanation could be found , then the symmetric large-@xmath20 case would now be strongly favored : it would only require the minimal @xmath116 tuning ( and would predict a heavy top ! ) .",
    "in fact , if the squarks were to be _ experimentally determined _ to be heavy while the gauginos were light , then this case would be no more fine - tuned than the conventional small @xmath24 scenario , but would have the advantage of explaining the top - bottom mass hierarchy ( through the @xmath100 and @xmath101 symmetries)which , after all , was historically the motivation for studying yukawa unification .",
    "we would like to thank m.  carena and c.  wagner for enjoyable discussions , in particular regarding the sign of the correlation between the diagrams in @xmath1 and those in @xmath48 .",
