    "among the many attempts to use the jarzynski equality @xcite for obtaining free energy profiles in molecular - level experiments and simulations , the stiff spring approximation ( ssa)@xcite has been tremendously successful .",
    "this has been mostly due to the role ssa plays as the theoretical basis for the steered molecular dynamics ( smd ) method .",
    "due to its conceptual simplicity and ease of implementation , smd has been widely used in studying biomolecular processes@xcite .",
    "ssa provides a comprehensive theoretical platform for smd simulations , by elucidating the relation between the harmonic guiding potentials and the behavior and distribution of non - equilibrium work performed during such simulations @xcite .",
    "one remarkable use of ssa came through its invocation by kosztin and coworkers in devising the forward - reverse ( fr ) method @xcite , which has provided an even simpler mechanism for both understanding the non - equilibrium work distributions in smd simulations and using them to obtain the pmfs for systems under study .",
    "jarzynski s equality @xcite gives the free energy difference @xmath1 between two macrostates @xmath2 and @xmath3 of a many - body system , as being equal to logarithm of the exponential average of the external work on the system , @xmath4 , performed over many distinct micropaths that evolve the system from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denotes ( path ) ensemble averaging .",
    "macrostates @xmath2 and @xmath3 are characterized by the values @xmath8 and @xmath9 of a reaction coordinate @xmath10 , which is often an externally controllable parameter of the system , such as the relative distance between two chosen molecules .",
    "the thermodynamic state parameters of the system should be well determined at state @xmath2 , but they can deviate from their initial values at @xmath2 , during the non - equilibrium evolution of the system to state @xmath3 .",
    "ssa asserts that when the external work in jarzynski s equality is performed using a _ sufficiently stiff _ spring , its distribution among an ensemble of trajectories will be gaussian .",
    "theorem @xcite then implies that the cumulant expansion of the logarithm of the right - hand - side of jarzynski s equality ( [ jarzynski ] ) can be safely terminated at the second order .",
    "this fact has been utilized by many authors in extracting free energy profiles , or pmfs , from non - equilibrium smd simulations ( see e.g. @xcite ) , where the first and second cumulants of work are used to obtain the free energy difference between the state @xmath2 and the subsequent macrostates along the chosen range of the reaction path .",
    "this already provides a better means of estimating @xmath11 , compared to a direct application of jarzynski s equality ; finding the first two cumulants of work distribution i.e. , @xmath12 and @xmath13 from a finite ensemble of trajectories has a much higher rate of convergence ( to a pre - specified accuracy ) than sampling the exponential of external work @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the convergence of the exponential average depends heavily on the small and even negative values of @xmath15 , whose occurrence is rare by the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "the fr method takes this one step further , by performing the steering process in both forward and reverse directions .",
    "this simple change dramatically improves the convergence rate to the underlying pmf , by liberating the simulator even from sampling the second cumulant of work distribution .",
    "the underlying mechanism can be best seen when external work in forward ( @xmath16 ) and reverse ( @xmath17 ) directions are written as the sum of their reversible and irreversible parts .",
    "the reversible part of the forward(reverse ) work is by definition equal to @xmath1 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "when steering in both directions is done using the same constant average speed , the irreversible or dissipative portion of the forward and reverse works are ( most often ) equal on average , i.e. @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 ( forward ) refers to @xmath21 process and @xmath22 ( reverse ) refers to the @xmath23 process .",
    "possible exceptions might include brownian steering of an asymmetrical object along a translational reaction path , while the orientation of the object is held fixed .",
    "however , in most cases , the average forward and reverse dissipative works are equal . in particular , it has been shown that when ssa requirements are met , this equality holds @xcite .",
    "as the main task of new theorems is to decompose the external work into reversible ( @xmath24 ) and dissipative ( @xmath25 ) parts , one can exploit the equality of @xmath26 in forward and reverse directions and write    @xmath27    this gives @xmath1 simply as half the difference of forward and reverse works , and the average dissipative work can then be calculated as @xmath28 .",
    "ssa formally puts no upper limit on the stiffness of the spring used for steering the systems under study , and only requires the harmonic potential to be sufficiently strong ( stiff ) .",
    "in particular , to conduct accurate steering one requires that @xmath29 , for @xmath30 . this is to guarantee the desired accuracy in steering the system along the prescribed path and also to guarantee that the distribution of the work values among separate trajectories is gaussian @xcite .",
    "while this is an essential requirement , the profile of @xmath31 is in general a priori unknown ( and hence it s first and second derivatives ) , so one often uses a criteria such as that given in eq.[k low ] , for the lower bound on the chosen value for @xmath0 .",
    "ssa is most often invoked in smd simulations , wherein time is discretized into _ time - steps _ of finite size @xmath32 .",
    "the motion of the steered object then follows a discrete path , jumping one time - step movement at a time . during each time - step ,",
    "a steering force @xmath33 $ ] is applied to each steered object , aiming it at its respective desired location by the end of the time - step , as prescribed by the simulator .",
    "if @xmath0 is not sufficiently large , the steered object will not closely follow the prescribed trajectory @xmath34 , as the external force applied during most time - steps will not be sufficiently large to steer the object against the underlying potential of the system and thermal fluctuations .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath0 is too large , one will most often apply too large a steering force on the object and _ overshoot _ it from the @xmath35 prescribed for the object by the end of the current time - step .",
    "this artifact occurs only in discretized trajectories and can result in deviation of the distribution of external work from a gaussian shape , which subsequently leads to biased estimation of the pmf through new theorems .",
    "this bias has previously been reported by other investigators @xcite , and attempts have been made to formulate and isolate the error @xcite . here",
    "we argue and demonstrate that this error originates in the choice of the spring constant .",
    "let us assume that for a given system , there exists an optimal value @xmath36 for the stiffness of the steering potential , which results in minimum average deviation of the steered object from the prescribed path , over the course of an smd simulation . using any @xmath37 results in loose , inaccurate steering , and @xmath38 results in the overshooting phenomenon just described . in the latter case ,",
    "every time that the steered object overshoots its target position , an extra amount of external work is performed on the system , which has not been spent on overcoming the local pmf barrier or thermal fluctuations , but rather on giving extra kinetic energy to the steered object . although this extra kinetic energy will be absorbed by the surrounding heat reservoir ( or any computational mechanism resembling its effect , e.g. , the temperature control algorithms in molecular dynamics simulations ) , its trace will remain in the recorded external work performed by the restraint .",
    "one should recall that ssa builds upon the assumption of the system being in the overdamped ( i.e. brownian ) limit of the langevin equation . in a system with the pmf @xmath31 ,",
    "subject to a harmonic guiding potential @xmath39 , the overdamped langevin equation reads @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the white - noise variable satisfying @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the local diffusion coefficient .",
    "there is no acceleration term in ( [ langevin ] ) , as in the brownian limit the @xmath44 term is overwhelmed by drag and random forces , and thus dropped from the langevin equation .",
    "this will not hold if @xmath0 is chosen to be so large that the @xmath39 term can accelerate the steered objects . in that limit",
    ", one has to replace the brownian particle model ( [ langevin ] ) with the more general brownian oscillator model , where the @xmath44 is also present .",
    "the former model serves as a basis for establishing the ssa , while the latter model can not easily serve the same purpose . in the absence of discretization",
    ", this problem would be far less serious .",
    "choice of the value of @xmath0 should thus be made with two criteria in mind : @xmath0 should be large enough to enable precise steering , but shall be small enough to let ( [ langevin ] ) remain valid",
    ". if the latter requirement is not satisfied in an smd simulation , in attempting to force the particle to achieve a constant target velocity , v , by discretized corrections with an average momentum correction of zero , large @xmath45 forces will accelerate the steered objects .",
    "this gives larger magnitude contributions to recorded values of external work above the mean ( since @xmath46 \\ge [ v^2 -(v -\\delta v)^2]$ ] ) , which result in work distributions that are skewed toward higher values of energy .",
    "this occurs both in forward and reverse work samplings , although in general not to the same extent .",
    "when input to either the jarzynski equality or the fr method ( [ fr ] ) , this right - skewness of work distributions will then result in systematic error , or bias , in the calculated pmfs .",
    "such a bias has been reported by other authors @xcite , and its relation to the underlying work distributions is investigated in the following sections . in a recent publication @xcite",
    "we have presented an efficient method for implementing the fr method , in the absence of these inertial effects . in the following ,",
    "we first demonstrate the outcome of the inertial effects just described on the characteristics of non - equilibrium work distributions and then on the pmf estimations obtained using ( the average of ) those work distributions .",
    "we then provide the criteria one needs to satisfy in designing smd simulations so that the inertial effects are avoided or minimized .",
    "a comprehensive scheme is then provided for extracting the pmfs using ( [ fr ] ) , wherein the peak value of the work distributions is used instead of the work average .",
    "we provide physical justification for this choice and then demonstrate how this method ( which we call the _ peak - finding _ method ) even partially avoids the bias when inertial effects are present and improves the accuracy of the pmf calculation in large ( bio)molecular simulations .",
    "our peak - finding method involves two stages .",
    "first the work distributions are built from the data of the applied force and the resultant displacements along smd trajectories . in the next stage",
    ", the peak - value of these distributions are found using a linear curve - fitting procedure , and used to calculate the pmf .",
    "we provide software for two separate algorithms , each performing one stage of this process , both under terms of the gnu general public license , version 3 . the peak - finding method presented here",
    "is based on the same principal idea that forms the basis of the bin - passing method @xcite : when analyzing an smd trajectory , external work values from individual time - steps can be considered separately and used towards calculating the average work function in the proper direction , based on actual direction of progress of the system during each time - step .",
    "this is in contrast to the more widely used _",
    "bin - crossing _ scheme , where work readings from successive time - steps are averaged together , regardless of the fluctuations in actual direction of progress of the system from one time - step to the next .",
    "although one formally requires a stiff - enough spring to reliably perform the steering in smd simulations , such steering is inherently imperfect due to thermal fluctuations in the system , and the ( a priori unknown ) pmf governing the average motion along the reaction path .",
    "when the spring constant @xmath0 chosen to perform the steering is too large , the overshooting phenomenon described in the introduction will happen often , and results in work values ( in both directions ) much larger than the typical residual pmf differences along the reaction path .",
    "this results in broadening the work distributions , an also in skewing them toward larger values .",
    "an example of such skewed work distributions is given in fig .",
    "[ fig_peptide - membrane_distributions ] and the resultant biased pmfs ( obtained using the fr method , with the bin - passing technique @xcite ) are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig_pmfs_bin - passing_far_range ] and [ fig_pmfs_bin - passing ] for a series of fr smd simulations performed on a peptide - membrane system . in each of these simulations",
    ", a small peptide is steered to go towards the surface of a phospholipid membrane patch ( from @xmath47 @xmath48to @xmath49  ) and back , with a speed of 5  / ns , where @xmath50 is the direction normal to the surface of the membrane .",
    "the z - component of the center of mass of the membrane is restrained to stay at zero .",
    "more details about the composition of the peptide - membrane system and the simulations are given in the caption to fig .",

    "each fr cycle in these series of simulations takes 15 ns , and the given total simulation times thus translate to about 53 , 49 and 34 statistically independent fr cycles , respectively .      to obtain the work distributions depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_peptide - membrane_distributions ] , the whole dataset of work values for all the time - steps spent within the given bin ( @xmath52 $ ] ) is read for each curve . each single time - step work reading is scaled up according to the linear approximation inherent to all pmf calculation methods : it is assumed that the value of the pmf difference , and thus the value of the external work required to overcome the pmf barrier , is constant across each bin along the reaction path .",
    "if the bin - width is @xmath53 and the system has progressed by a distance @xmath54 along the reaction path during a given time - step , while an external work @xmath55 is performed on the system , the scaled work will be equal to @xmath56 .",
    "using this notion of scaled work enables us to maximally exploit the statistics of time - steps , toward separating forward and reverse work distributions for each bin .",
    "we hereafter refer to these scaled work values simply as work values .",

    "the smallest spring constant results in smallest ( nearly negligible ) skewness .",
    "the width ( or dispersion ) of work distributions also reduces consistently with @xmath0 .",
    "the combined effect of reduced skewness and dispersion in work distributions is more accurate and less biased estimate of @xmath12 .",

    "ssa predicts that the distribution of work values obtained from smd trajectories in a given system will be a ( non - skewed ) gaussian , provided that @xmath0 is high enough .",
    "the fr method @xcite further implies that smd trajectories obtained using the same steering speed should yield identical average work values for the same system .",
    "together , these two assertions imply that the peak location of the work distribution ( @xmath66 ) obtained using a finite steering speed under ssa simulation conditions should be the same as @xmath12 from the same set of simulations .",
    "one can thus use @xmath66 instead of @xmath12 in ( [ fr ] ) to calculate the pmf . this substitution may seem unnecessary and computationally more expensive .",
    "but use of the scaled work notion , described above , makes it economic to establish the work distributions from fairly short simulations .",
    "what is more , we show ( e.g. in fig .",
    "[ fig_pmfs_bin - passing_far_range ] , that using @xmath66 in place of @xmath12 in ( [ fr ] ) results in faster convergence ( and with reduced bias ) to the underlying pmf .",
    "given the whole profile of a skewed gaussian distribution , we can find the peak location more accurately than we can calculate the average , and estimated peak location is less affected by increased skewness .",
    "the benefits of substituting @xmath66 for @xmath12 in ( [ fr ] ) are a direct result of this simple fact .",
    "equality of the average and the peak value of work distributions among sets of smd simulations in a given system should be independent of the stiffness of the spring used to perform the steering , as long as @xmath0 is large enough to satisfy the ssa requirements @xcite , as the fr method does not require that different samplings be done using the same @xmath0 . figs .",
    "[ fig_peptide - membrane_distributions ] and [ fig_k - na_distributions ] ( and many similar distributions for other reaction path bins , not shown here ) manifestly shows that this does not hold ; using different spring constants to perform smd on the same system and with the same speed has resulted in work distributions with different average and peak values of non - equilibrium work .",
    "one nevertheless observes ( fig .",
    "[ fig_peptide - membrane_distributions].d ) that the peak - values of these work distributions are much closer together than their corresponding average values",
    ".      one possible source of the skewness observed in the work distributions is the physical asymmetries in the system under study .",
    "as a thought experiment , we consider the classic example of a gas enclosed in a cylinder , its volume being controlled externally via the position of a piston .",
    "we now consider a series of forward ( compressing ) and reverse ( decompressing ) events , where the volume of the gas is changed from an initial value @xmath67 to a final value @xmath68 .",
    "the compressing and decompressing events are performed at an arbitrary but constant and equal speed .",
    "other thermodynamical details of the process are not of user concern here , as long as we assume that the initial states of all the compressing and decompressing events are equilibrium states with the same temperature @xmath69 . assuming that the initial equilibrium pressure of the system at @xmath2 ( @xmath70 , associated with @xmath67 ) is higher than or equal to the pressure of the surrounding environment ( or heat reservoir ) , the forward ( compressing ) events would require higher work values , than the reverse ( decompressing ) events .",
    "this , however , does not necessarily imply that the distribution of forward works should be skewed .",
    "the consequence of the asymmetry in the process might simply be that the average forward work is higher than the average reverse work for this experiment , and this indeed should be the case for ( [ fr ] ) to give the correct free energy difference between states @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "as yet another possible source of the skewness in work distributions , we imagine various sets of these compressing - decompressing events , where successively higher drift speeds are used .",
    "the drift speed is equal within each set .",
    "we can now ask whether realizations of the process performed at higher drift speeds might produce skewed work distributions , as dissipative work generally increases with the drift speed , making larger ( positive ) contributions to the external work .        to investigate these two possibilities",
    ", we consider a very asymmetric molecular system , with a @xmath71 buckminsterfullerene molecule being restrained to approach a silicon dioxide ( silica ) slab , make contact with the silica slab , and then move away from the slab .",
    "the reaction path is the normal distance between the center of mass of the @xmath71 molecule and the surface of the silica slab .",
    "the process is performed in an aqueous environment at atmospheric pressure and room temperature ( t = 300 k ) .",
    "more details about the simulation box are given in the caption of fig .",
    "[ fig_c60-silica_picture ] .",
    "when the @xmath71 molecule approaches the silica slab at a finite speed , water molecules are momentarily trapped between the two objects , resembling the gas compression process explained above .",
    "when moving away from the silica slab , the @xmath71 molecule experiences no similar effect with water molecules , i.e. , it interacts with water molecules whose movement is not restricted by any physical barriers .",
    "work distributions shown in fig . [ fig_c60-silica_distributions ] for two different spring constants , each with three different drift speeds ( six simulation series in total ) show essentially no trace of skewness .",
    "absence of skewness even in work distributions obtained with a very high spring constant of 10,000 @xmath51 in fig . [ fig_c60-silica_distributions ] , can be attributed to constraining ( rather than restraining ) the silica slab . following the terminology of the namd literature @xcite , a _ constrained _ object is one that is held strictly fixed in space , with absolutely no movement allowed for any of its atoms .",
    "as we will explain below , external work distributions become skewed only when both objects that are steered to change position relative to one another , are _ restrained _ using very stiff springs ( i.e. , unlike a constrained particle , some small movement is allowed ) .",
    "the absence of the restraining forces ( and hence of external work ) on one of the steered objects ( the silica slab ) here allows us to study the isolated effect of other possible causes of skewness , i.e. , physical asymmetry and drift speeds .",
    "work distributions from simulations with drift speeds varying within two orders of magnitude and spring constants differing by three orders of magnitude , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_c60-silica_distributions].a and b , show essentially no skewness .",
    "these distributions are from a rather large bin ( @xmath72 $ ] ) where the distance between the @xmath71 molecule and the silica slab is small enough that the trapping of water molecules between the two objects is plausible .",
    "these non - skewed work distributions ( and similar ones from other bins , not shown here ) , strongly suggest that the skewness of work distributions can be attributed to neither physical asymmetry in the system , nor the ( high ) steering speeds .",
    "higher width of work distributions in part b of fig .",
    "[ fig_c60-silica_distributions ] compared to part a , is another clear example of broadening of the work distributions as a result of using stiffer steering springs .",

    "smd simulations with higher steering @xmath0 generally have higher step - wise speeds and broader step - wise speed distributions , which correlates well with their broader work distributions and higher @xmath12 .",
    "we demonstrated ( e.g. in fig .",

    "[ fig_c60-silica_distributions ] clearly shows that the width of work distributions depends strongly on @xmath0 , and we assert that this is due to the effect of @xmath0 on the width and average magnitude of the distribution of step - wise speeds . in the conventional bin - crossing method , obtaining similar work distributions is much costlier , and the width of such distributions will in general depend on the average pulling speed @xmath73 .",
    "the skewness of work distributions obtained from an smd simulation with a given spring constant and drift velocity may , in general , depend also on the geometry and mass of the steered objects .",

    "<S> the bias manifests in such simulations in the form of a systematic error that increases with simulation time . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the proper upper limit for @xmath0 , such that the inertial effects are practically avoided . </S>",
    "<S> used together with the relation for the lower limit of @xmath0 ( which follows naturally from considering thermal fluctuations per degree of freedom of the system ) , the practitioner of smd can then conduct accurate steering , while satisfying the brownian dynamics requirements of ssa . even in cases </S>",
    "<S> where inertial effects ( due to high @xmath0 ) result in biased estimations of the pmf , we argue and demonstrate that using the peak - value ( rather than the statistical mean ) of the work distributions vastly reduces the bias in the calculated pmfs and improves the accuracy . </S>"
