    "for many decades we have been aware that dark matter exists through its gravitational effects on galaxies and the universe as a whole . over this time",
    ", compelling candidates for dark matter have been proposed that often try to link the origin of dark matter to other outstanding problems in physics and cosmology . amongst others",
    "these include , for example , weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) , axions @xcite , sterile neutrinos @xcite , superwimps @xcite , and asymmetric dark matter ( adm ) models that link the origin of dark - matter and baryon number ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "many of these models are already well constrained from a remarkable effort in experimental dark matter physics including direct and indirect searches for dark matter and constraints from cosmology , and improved measurements and data from the large hadron collidor ( lhc ) have the potential to further shed light on dark matter physics ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    despite these intriguing possibilities for dark matter physics",
    "it remains entirely possible that dark matter belongs to hidden sector and lacks standard model gauge charge .",
    "in such a case dark matter is expected to have at most extra - weak interactions with the standard model , and in the extreme case interacts only via gravitational forces .",
    "in such a case is dark matter physics wholly inaccessible to us ?",
    "we take heart in the knowledge that the only reason we know about dark matter is via its gravitational effects in cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "the most scrutinized candidate for dark matter is arguably the wimp because the so - called  wimp miracle \" ensures that the simple process of its weak - scale interactions freezing out from a thermal plasma give it nearly the right relic abundance to be all of the dark matter .",
    "but as this result only relies on the size of the total annihilation cross section being close to typical electroweak value @xmath1 ( and not that the annihilation products are standard model particles ) the wimp miracle can be extended to a `` wimpless miracle '' in hidden - sector models that also have a similar value for the cross section but with a range of masses extending down to @xmath2kev @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a gauge mediated model of supersymmetry breaking is adopted that naturally gives @xmath3 and wimp - like dark matter that decouples from the hidden plasma when it is nonrelativistic . also see ref .",
    "@xcite for different possible origins of hidden sector dark matter . in ref .",
    "@xcite hidden - sector models that decoupled when ultrarelativistic were considered . in this work we present a unified treatment of the freeze - out of thermal relics in hidden sectors for arbitrary cross section @xmath4 , only requiring that constraints from cosmology are satisfied , and find viable dark matter that freezes out when it is relativistic , semirelativistic , or nonrelativistic .    already , there are stringent bounds on hidden sector dark matter from cosmology if the hidden - sector reheated to a temperature at or above the temperature of the visible sector .",
    "if the hidden sector has more than a few light species for dark matter to annihilate into then constraints on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) rule out such models @xcite .",
    "however , in hidden sector models the reheat temperature of the hidden sector can easily be different from that of the visible ( standard model ) sector depending on the details of the reheating process or if the visible sector and hidden sector contain a different particle spectrum ( different number of degrees of freedom as a function of temperature ) and thus cool differently .",
    "note that implicit in saying the visible and hidden sectors are at different temperatures is the assumption that the two sectors are not in thermal contact ( or at least they lost thermal contact considerably before bbn ) and processes that could thermalize them in a hubble time are inefficient .    as discussed above ,",
    "we take a model - independent approach to hidden - sector dark matter in this paper and let the cross section @xmath4 be a free parameter .",
    "in addition we allow the mass @xmath5 of our dark matter particle @xmath6 and the hidden - to - visible temperature ratio @xmath7 ( at dark matter freeze - out ) be additional parameters and map of the viable region of this three - dimensional parameter space .",
    "depending on the values of @xmath5 , @xmath8 , and @xmath4 the freeze - out process can be relativistic , semirelativistic or nonrelativistic .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : ra ] we discuss the standard boltzmann equations involved in the freeze - out process and how they must be extended for the general hidden - sector case with @xmath9 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ta ] we discuss our approach to modelling the temperature dependence of the annihilation cross section in detail , how we treat the problematic semirelativistic regime , and a numerical approach to relativistic and nonrelativistic decoupling within the same framework . in sec .",

    "in this section we review the standard boltzmann equation for the freeze - out of annihilation of dark matter and its extension to the hidden - sector case .",

    ", @xmath21 is the effective number of entropy degrees of freedom , and here and elsewhere , @xmath22 are modified bessel functions .",
    "this can be expressed in a convenient form by using the scaled variable @xmath23 \\langle\\sigma v\\rangle y$ ] . in the limit that the temperature dependence of @xmath24 is negligible",

    "( [ maineq ] ) with @xmath27 as the initial condition for @xmath28 at small @xmath29 ( high temperatures ) .",
    "however , if dark matter is part of a hidden sector decoupled from the visible sector when it freezes out then its equilibrium distribution is given by the hidden - sector temperature @xmath30 rather than @xmath10 , where we have introduced the hidden - to - visible temperature ratio @xmath8 .",
    "it s conventional to cast the total density ( that appears in the hubble rate ) or entropy density in terms of an effective number of degrees of freedom @xmath31 [ or entropy degrees of freedom @xmath32 at a temperature @xmath10 . as discussed in , for example , refs.@xcite , in a universe with both a visible and hidden sector there are two copies of these functions , @xmath33 for the visible sector and @xmath34 for the hidden sector . since for relativistic particles the energy density scales as @xmath35 and entropy density scales as @xmath36 we find that the combined @xmath31 and @xmath37 take the form @xmath38 where the rightmost approximation typically holds when @xmath39 and is used it in the remainder of the paper .",
    "if the hidden sector is relatively cold compared to the visible sector then the energy density ( and hubble expansion rate ) of the universe is essentially given by the density of visible - sector radiation .",
    "thus the key change to eq .",
    "( [ basicboltz ] ) is just that @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the equilibrium yield of dark matter in a hidden sector and the standard case is recovered when @xmath42 . in terms of the scaled yield @xmath28 we have @xmath43 \\ , \\label{eq : constcross}\\ ] ] with @xmath44 \\langle\\sigma v\\rangle y_0(x;\\xi)$ ] .",
    "equation ( [ eq : constcross ] ) is valid when the thermally averaged cross section is almost constant at freeze - out .",
    "we discuss in the next section the more general case when the temperature dependence of the cross section can not be neglected .",
    "while approximate analytical solution are well known when dark matter decouples when either highly relativistic @xmath45 or nonrelativistic @xmath46 , for the intermediate semirelativistic case the thermally - averaged cross section @xmath24 can not be expanded in either dark matter mass or velocity , and analytical methods are less tractable . however , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a useful and accurate interpolating expression for the thermal average cross section was introduced that can be used to track the dark matter freeze - out process even in the semirelativistic regime @xmath47 . the general expression for @xmath24",
    "is given by @xmath48 while , strictly speaking , using the mb distribution is improper for the semirelativistic case , it has been shown to yield accurate results for the final relic density @xcite .",
    "this is partly due to cancellations between the numerator and denominator and also because the final relic density becomes quite insensitive to the precise value of @xmath49 as freeze - out moves from the nonrelativistic toward the relativistic case . in the case of an s - wave process , after some simplification , @xmath24 can be put in the form @xmath50 now in the nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic limits it reads @xmath51 repectively .",

    "a key quantity we need to know to estimate the final relic abundance and whether it occurs in the ultrarelativistic , semirelativistic , or nonrelativistic regimes is the freeze - out temperature @xmath64 or equivalently @xmath65 .",
    "exactly how @xmath64 is defined is somewhat arbitrary , but a natural definition is the temperature @xmath64 at which @xmath66 for the first time  the interaction rate drops below the hubble rate .",
    "such a definition can be used to accurately estimate the final yield in the relativistic and semirelativistic cases , and can naturally extend to the conventional nonrelativistic case .",

    "the freeze - out solution is shown in fig .",

    "despite higher values of @xmath49 , and thus later freeze - out with more exponential suppression , the larger relative temperature more than compensates in this example .",
    "although reasonable approximations can be found in the nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic cases , to calculate the present relic density in what follows we use the yield found from numerically solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : fulleq ] ) at a late time @xmath69 where the yield is essentially constant .",
    "the cosmological dark - matter density is then @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the critical density of the universe .",
    "we use the measured value of the dark matter relic density from ref .",
    "@xcite to constrain the parameter space .",
    "generally , hidden - sector dark matter does not need to freeze - out when nonrelativistic ( cold ) in order to match observations @xcite .",
    "the dark - matter particles may have significant thermal momentum at freeze - out ( it can be warm or hot from the hidden - sector perspective ) , and this can lead to a significant free - streaming length that can suppress the matter power spectrum on scales as large as those corresponding to galactic length scales . while the freeze - out process is thermal in the hidden sector , since the hidden sector is at a different temperature than the visible sector , it mimics a non - thermal freeze - out process .",
    "while the detailed particle physics model can be rather different , it is quite similar to the familiar case of sterile neutrino warm dark matter @xcite with the important difference that it did in fact thermalize in the hidden sector at a temperature lower than the visible universe .",
    "we will see that this difference will make the free - streaming bound somewhat less stringent compared to the a standard warm dark matter case with @xmath72 .     for @xmath73 while the dashed line shows the approximation we have used for our numerical code . ]",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that in the case of warm dark matter , a common approximation for the free - streaming scale used for standard model neutrinos , @xmath74 , does not correspond to the actual suppression scale in the matter power spectra . instead , the largest scale affected due to free - streaming is essentially the particle horizon of dark matter particles .",
    "the comoving free - streaming horizon of a dark matter particle with typical velocity @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 corresponds to time of freeze - out and matter - radiation equality respectively and @xmath79 is the scale factor .",
    "the scale factor dependence of the velocity changes with @xmath49 and the mass of dark matter .",
    "a simple calculation shows the momentum average of the particle velocity , @xmath80 , is given by    @xmath81    @xmath82 is the momentum at freeze - out , and @xmath83 is the hidden - sector temperature at freeze - out . here",

    "we find the free - streaming length computed using this approximation versus eq .",
    "( [ vel ] ) agree at the few percent level  accurate enough for this work .    for relativistic decoupling",
    "it is straightforward to show that the free - streaming length is only a function of mass , but for the semirelativistic and nonrelativistic cases it depends on both mass and @xmath8 . in all cases",
    "the comoving free - streaming length must satisfy the bound from the measurements of the linear power spectra on small scales which in turn constrains the dark - matter parameter space @xmath101 .",
    "we use here the bound @xcite .",
    "a robust and model independent lower bound on the mass of dark matter particles is obtained by bounding the phase - space density evolution of small galaxies like the dwarf spheroidal satellites ( dsphs ) of the milky way .",
    "originally suggested by tremaine and gunn in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been developed further by several authors in , for example , refs .",
    "if the dark matter is fermion it gets a stringent bound , independent of cosmological evolution , as pauli blocking enforces a densest packing of the dark matter phase space distribution",
    ". however , a different bound relevant for both bosons and fermions applies to any bath of particles once in thermal equilibrium with interactions that freeze out . since the microscopic phase space density ( psd )",
    "is exactly conserved for collisionless and dissapationless particles by liouville s theorem the coarse - grained ( averaged ) psd can not be an increasing function of time .",
    "this means that the maximum coarse - grained psd in a galaxy today , with core radius @xmath102 and velocity dispersion @xmath103 , must not exceed the maximum value of the microscopic psd ( the fermi - dirac for a fermion ) over cosmic history @xmath104 .",
    "this inequality translates to a bound on the mass of    @xmath105    where @xmath106 is defined in the previous section . here",
    "one assumes that the collapse of dark matter from the initial state to bound halos is dissipationless and collisionless .",
    "the maximum of of the distribution @xmath106 is a function of @xmath107 , and through this the tremain - gunn mass @xmath108 also depends on @xmath109 and @xmath4 .",

    "we now discuss our results for the allowed parameter space in the rather general hidden dark matter models discussed in this work .",
    "we performed a survey of the parameter space in the ( @xmath111 ) plane for fixed @xmath5 and in the ( @xmath112 ) plane for fixed @xmath4  solving the freeze - out equations numerically .",
    "we then require that hidden - sector dark matter : i ) accounts for the observed dark - matter density ; ii ) has a free - streaming length consistent with structure formation ; and iii ) satisfies the tremaine - gunn psd bound .",
    "our results extends the work of ref .",
    "@xcite for several reasons .",
    "firstly , we allow the size of the dark matter scattering cross section to vary .",
    "secondly , freeze - out and decoupling does not necessarily occur when the dark matter particles are nonrelativistic @xmath113 .",
    "finally , since these constraints are relevant for relativistic and semirelativistic models , we include constraints from the free - streaming length and psd .",
    "a special case of our study with @xmath114 and @xmath115 corresponds to wimpless dark matter scenario studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we have checked that our calculation reproduces their results in that limit .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the allowed parameter space in the ( @xmath111 ) plane for different choices of dark - matter mass .",
    "we find that for dark matter masses @xmath116 there are no values of @xmath8 or @xmath4 that satisfy all the three constraints .",
    "this puts a lower bound @xmath117 on the mass of hidden - sector dark matter that can account for all dark - matter in the universe in a model - independent way .",
    "this bound is weaker than the limit on conventional ( @xmath72 ) wark darm matter ( wdm ) of @xmath118 described in refs .",
    "@xcite because the hidden sector is at a lower temperature ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "it is clear from fig .  3 that at very low mass the free - streaming bound is more important than the tremaine - gunn bound , and",
    "so the lower limit on mass @xmath119 is determined mainly by the free - streaming bound . at higher masses",
    "the tremaine - gunn bound becomes relevant as free - streaming becomes more and more suppressed ( see the right panel of fig .  3 ) and the allowed region of parameter space increases .",
    "eventually , for @xmath120 , only the constraint from dark matter relic density remains relevant .",
    "the bands shown represents the width arising from the range of allowed dark matter relic density @xmath121 .",
    "the legend color bar represents different values of @xmath122 at the time of freeze - out and shows the transition from relativistic , to semirelativistic , to nonrelativistic freeze - out as @xmath5 increases .",
    "we see that freeze - out can be easily semirelativistic @xmath123 or relativistic @xmath124 and thus showing hidden - sector dark matter that freezes out when warm or hot is consistent with all cosmological bounds and may be considered when building particle - physics models of dark matter .    in fig .",
    "[ newcontours ] we show the allowed parameter space in ( @xmath112 ) plane for three choices of the scattering cross section @xmath4 .",
    "we see that , intuitively , for lower cross sections and interaction rates the freeze - out process tends to be relativistic , but as the cross section increases freeze - out can occur later and be semirelativistic or nonrelativistic . in fig .",
    "[ contourswimp ] we show that we recover the standard cold wimp scenario for higher mass ( @xmath125 ) and typical wimp scale cross section .",
    "as we move to higher mass , @xmath8 need to be below unity to satisfy the dark matter abundance .",
    "if the dark matter is in a hidden sector then it has at most feeble interactions with the standard model so that it never equilibrated with the standard model plasma ( or at least fell out of equilibrium very early on ) .",
    "its direct detection is extremely unlikely and one would expect its detection only through astrophysical signatures .",
    "however , a more precise statement is that any possible interaction rate with the standard model must be less than the hubble rate @xmath126 throughout cosmic history . in spite of this constraint ,",
    "it is not impossible to get direct or indirect detection of hidden - sector dark matter .",
    "this occurs because of extra freedom in the hidden sector freeze - out process .",
    "in contrast with typical wimp models , a wide range of dark matter mass can produce the observed thermal relic density , and importantly the dark matter annihilation cross section @xmath4 determines only the thermal relic density while the direct or indirect detection rates are determined by @xmath127 . in the context of the wimpless scenario ref .",
    "@xcite has suggested that scalar hidden dark matter may have non - gauge interaction with the standard model through connector particles , with interaction of the form @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is a scalar hidden dark matter particle , @xmath130 are chiral fermions and @xmath131 are standard model fermions . with such interactions",
    "hidden - sector dark matter can allow interesting direct and indirect detection phenomenology @xcite .",
    "for a fermionic hidden dark matter detection might be more difficult as low - energy interactions involve higher dimensional operators such as the dimension 6 four - fermion interaction @xmath132 . this type of interaction scales like @xmath133 above an interaction scale @xmath134 and as @xmath135 far below it , where @xmath136 .",

    "dark matter might belong to a hidden sector with new particle physics totally unknown to us . even if this is the case , we can put constraints on its particle properties from its gravitational effects on the universe .",
    "the constraints we discuss here are valid for a wide class of hidden - sector models of dark matter where the dark matter is a thermal relic particle that was once in equilibrium with a hidden - sector plasma .",
    "we have allowed the dark - matter annihilation cross section to be a free parameter and the hidden sector temperature to be different from the visible sector . due to these extra freedoms",

    "<S> we explore the model - independent constraints from cosmology on a dark - matter particle with no prominent standard model interactions that interacts and thermalizes with other particles in a hidden sector . without specifying detailed hidden - sector particle physics </S>",
    "<S> , we characterize the relevant physics by the annihilation cross section , mass , and temperature ratio of the hidden to visible sectors . while encompassing the standard cold wimp scenario </S>",
    "<S> , we do not require the freeze - out process to be nonrelativistic . </S>",
    "<S> rather , freeze - out may also occur when dark matter particles are semirelativistic or relativistic . </S>",
    "<S> we solve the boltzmann equation to find the conditions that hidden - sector dark matter accounts for the observed dark - matter density , satisfies the tremaine - gunn bound on dark - matter phase space density , and has a free - streaming length consistent with cosmological constraints on the matter power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for masses @xmath0  kev no region of parameter space satisfies all these constraints . </S>",
    "<S> this is a gravitationally - mediated lower bound on the dark - matter mass for any model in which the primary component of daqrk matter once had efficient interactions  even if it has never been in equilibrium with the standard model . </S>"
