    "( [ eq31 ] ) is given by the number of single  particle states in the trap and equals 2024 in our example .",
    "again , we consider na atoms in a rb bath . as the initial condition we take the @xmath170 bosons to be equally distributed over the degenerate single",
    " particle orbitals with energy @xmath364 while all other orbitals are empty .",
    "this initial condition corresponds to the situation discussed above for the microcanonical approach .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows a plot of the total energy as a function of time .",
    "initially , the decay is fast but nonexponential and can barely be distinguished from the decay within the microcanonical approach ( compare with fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . at later times",
    "the equilibrium @xmath365 is approached exponentially fast with the equilibration rate @xmath366 .",
    "this rate was determined from the time evolution shown in fig .",
    "alternatively , the rate might be obtained upon linearization of the rate equations  ( [ eq31 ] ) around the equilibrium solution of section  [ con ] .",
    "however , we did not pursue this point any further .",
    "the equilibrium energy is about 2% smaller than the corresponding value found in the microscopic approach . according to the data used in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we find a temperature of @xmath367 , slightly deviating from the bath temperature .",
    "we recall that the bath temperature enters the rate equations through the rate coefficients . within our numerical accuracy , and especially because of the semiclassical approximation , we expect the relative error of the rate coefficients to be a few percent . in view of this fact ,",
    "the agreement between the temperature of the bath and the one found in our calculation , is quite satisfactory .",
    "@xmath328    comparing the results obtained in the microcanonical approach and by using factorization , we note that the equilibration rate obtained from the microcanonical approach is about a factor @xmath368 larger than the corresponding rate found using factorization .",
    "the loss of energy at short times is , however , practically identical in both approaches .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that most of the energy is removed from system @xmath18 during the early period of the cooling process .",
    "therefore , both approaches yield comparable predictions for the cooling time . for example , about 90% of the finally removed energy @xmath369 have been transfered to the bath at a time @xmath370 .",
    "we also note that the results obtained in the microcanonical approach are somewhat less sensitive to the exact values of the rate coefficients than those obtained using factorization .",
    "this is plausible since only sums over many rate coefficients enter the rate equations in the former case .",
    "let us finally discuss sympathetic cooling of systems with equal masses .",
    "note that the regime of similar masses lies somewhat outside the scope of this work .",
    "we recall that the bath particles are assumed to be much heavier than the particles of the system .",
    "this difference in masses is also reflected by the use of different wave functions for the particles of the bath and the particles of the system . a detailed computation with identical wave functions for system and bath may thus yield quantitatively different results . with these cautionary remarks in mind we turn to sympathetic cooling of @xmath323rb atoms in a bath of @xmath323rb atoms .",
    "( system and bath atoms are assumed to be in different hyperfine states ) .",
    "the results apply , of course , equally to all other cases where cooled atoms and bath particles have equal masses . within the microcanonical approach we found equilibration to a final state with energy @xmath371 .",
    "this corresponds to the temperature @xmath372 and agrees well with the temperature of the bath .",
    "the equilibration rate is @xmath373 and the cooling time @xmath374 . using the approach based on factorization we found for the energy of the equilibrated system @xmath375 corresponding to a temperature @xmath376 .",
    "the equilibration rate was @xmath377 ; the cooling time @xmath378 . at the initial stages of the cooling process there",
    "is again barely any difference between the microcanonical approach and the one based on factorization .",
    "nevertheless , equilibration rates vary by a factor of about 1.7 . comparing the results for the rb - rb system with the na - rb system one",
    "thus finds that sympathetic cooling times ( in units of @xmath379 ) decrease significantly with decreasing mass ratio @xmath380 between system and bath particles . in our case , the factor ( about 2.5 ) is similar to the factor reported at the end of section  [ rat ] .",
    "we have derived rate equations for the sympathetic cooling of systems composed of bosons or of fermions .",
    "the rate equations were obtained from the master equation derived in ref .",
    "@xcite in a sequence of steps .",
    "first we used the perturbatively weak interaction @xmath381 between the particles in the system to be cooled to lift the degeneracy of the many ",
    "body states in the trap .",
    "this allowed us in a second step to use the decoherence argument and resulted in a reduced density matrix of diagonal form . in a third step we invoked an ergodicity argument and assumed that the equilibration between ( quasi)degenerate states is much faster than the cooling process",
    "; this assumption reduced the number of independent diagonal elements further . from here on we proceeded along two different routes . within the microcanonical approach we obtained rate equations that govern the occupation probabilities of sets of ( quasi)degenerate many  body states .",
    "this results in a linear problem with sparse matrix .",
    "the dimension of the problem increases with particle number and trap cutoff .",
    "alternatively , we traced the reduced density matrix over single  particle states . assuming that occupation probabilities for different orbitals factorize we obtained a nonlinear set of rate equations for the mean occupation probabilities of the single  particle orbitals .",
    "the dimension of this problem depends only on the trap cutoff .",
    "we showed how to extend this approach to include correlations and particle escape from the open trap , although we did not yet test these extensions numerically .",
    "we provided several checks on our assumptions . to check the consistency of our assumptions we used the rate equations and computed the probability distribution for the ground state occupation ;",
    "the results agree with those of the literature .",
    "we further showed that the decoherence argument is justified . off  diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix decay on a time scale that is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of bath particles and , thus , very short .",
    "the ergodicity argument was supported by the dependence of the rate coefficients on energy transfer , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "any solution of the rate equations requires as input the rate coefficients .",
    "we derived analytical expressions for these coefficients .",
    "a numerical evaluation of the resulting formulas becomes impractical , however , for transitions between high  lying single ",
    "particle states that are close in energy .",
    "we solved this problem by using a semiclassical approximation .",
    "we note that the computation of the rate coefficients is the time  consuming part in practical applications of the rate equations derived in this work .",
    "we discussed the dependence of the rate coefficients on the parameters of the system .",
    "the two different rate equations obtained in this paper yield results that are in semi  quantitative agreement . within both approaches ,",
    "the cooling times are about the same : both descriptions of the cooling process yield almost identical short  time behavior and practically identical final states of the system .",
    "the equilibration rates , however , differ by a factor of about 1.6 .",
    "it is not easy to point to the origin of this difference .",
    "we recall that input parameters ( rate coefficients ) were computed to a relative accuracy of about a few percent .",
    "we can only speculate that the long  time behavior of the solutions to the rate equations are sensitive to such details .    in practice ,",
    "the choice between both approaches depends on the problem under consideration .",
    "one has to solve either a large linear problem whose dimension depends on trap cutoff and particle number , or a smaller nonlinear one with a dimension that only depends on the trap cutoff .",
    "the treatment of large systems requires the computation of a large number of rate coefficients .",
    "sums of rate coefficients enter the rate equations in the microcanonical approach .",
    "larger systems may become accessible more easily once these sums can be obtained without computing all terms individually .",
    "work along this direction is in progress .",
    "likewise , we have not tested yet the validity of the factorization assumption by solving the combined system of equations , eqs .",
    "( [ eq35a ] ) and ( [ eq35],[eq36 ] ) .",
    "we have assumed throughout that the interaction @xmath381 between particles in the cooled system is weak .",
    "it is known  @xcite , however , that no matter how small @xmath381 is , this interaction can not be neglected in the condensed state once the number of condensed atoms is sufficiently large .",
    "does this statement  and the corresponding consideration for the superconducting state of fermions ",
    "seriously limite our approach ?",
    "we believe not . more precisely",
    ": there exists a generalization of our approach which overcomes the problem .",
    "it is based on the observation that it is sufficient to deal with the system in mean  field approximation since thermodynamic properties are unaffected by collective excitations  @xcite .",
    "our rate coefficients are defined in terms of single  particle states and single  particle energies .",
    "we may take these as solutions of mean  field equations .",
    "thus , we can extend our scheme as follows .",
    "we follow the cooling process as described by our rate equations to the point where the occupation number @xmath222 of the ground state exceeds the critical value at which interactions become important .",
    "we define a new set of single  particle wave functions and energies self ",
    "consistently for that value of @xmath222 and calculate the rate coefficients . in this way we may proceed to arbitrarily large values of @xmath222 , and similarly for a system of fermions .",
    "obviously , implementation of this scheme is practical only if we succeed in speeding up the calculation of the rate coefficients or of sums over these coefficients .",
