    "granular matter , when condensed to sufficiently high volume fractions , undergoes a ` jamming ' transition to the jammed state .",
    "the jammed state is defined as the condition when a many - body system is blocked in a configuration far from equilibrium , such that relaxation can not occur within a measurable time - scale . for granular matter",
    ", the jammed state indicates a transition between a solid - like behavior , and a liquid - like behavior . at high volume fractions ,",
    "the physical size of the constituent grains inhibits particle motion , thereby rendering the system out of equilibrium , and the granular system behaves more like a solid .",
    "thermal motion does not govern the exploration of states in jammed granular matter .",
    "theories proposed by edwards and collaborators @xcite propose a statistical mechanics for granular matter based on jamming the constituent grains at a fixed total volume such that all microscopic jammed states are equally probable and exhibit ergodicity .",
    "the exploration of reversible jammed states is achieved via an external perturbation such as tapping or shear , not brownian motion as in thermal systems .",
    "there is an important difference between reversible jammed states , and states that are only mechanically stable within certain limits of perturbation magnitude .",
    "for example , pouring grains into a container results in a pile at a particular angle of repose .",
    "this mechanical equilibrium configuration is jammed regularly but not reversibly jammed because in response to an external perturbation , the constituent particles will irreversibly rearrange , approaching a truly jammed configuration .",
    "studying an ensemble of truly jammed , reversible states is thereby suitable for a plausible application of statistical mechanics under the present theory .",
    "these ensembles , inherently non - equilibrium systems , will not be governed by the commonly used parameters of equilibrium statistical mechanics , such as a bath temperature .    in recent studies",
    "theoretical mean - field models of glasses @xcite have introduced the concept of an `` effective temperature '' as extracted from the fd relations in non - equilibrium systems . while not equivalent to the equilibrium bath temperature , the effective temperature reflects a change in the relaxation time - scale of the system .",
    "these non - equilibrium systems extend beyond glasses , and into granular media , where physical size of the constituent grains inhibits motion , allowing for jammed systems far from equilibrium .",
    "this concept has been furthered by computer simulations of granular media and other non - equilibrium soft - matter systems @xcite .",
    "it remains a question whether or not granular media can be characterized by an effective temperature , thus revealing a dynamic counterpart to the static `` compactivity '' as proposed by edwards @xcite .",
    "athermal systems require the input of energy by an external source to explore the effective temperature @xcite .",
    "one proposed method of calculating the effective temperature of a jammed granular system is a slow shearing procedure @xcite , leading to the design of the experiment we present in @xcite .",
    "slow shearing , at the quasi - static limit , allows for extrapolation towards an effective temperature of jammed , static , systems .",
    "the jammed system of interest is one of identical , spherical grains , confined between the two cylindrical walls of a 3d couette cell .",
    "the grains are further confined by an external pressure in the vertical direction .",
    "the inner cylinder of the couette cell is slowly rotated to induce shearing in the system .",
    "tracer particles are inserted in the system , and their trajectories recorded via multiple cameras surrounding the system .",
    "the couette cell is partially filled with a refractive index matched fluid to allow for system transparency .",
    "the cylindrical walls are roughened by gluing grains , identical to those of the bulk , such that crystallization is avoided .",
    "the cameras record tracer particle trajectories throughout the bulk , recording data in cylindrical coordinates , @xmath0 .",
    "distributions of tracer particle displacements are measured in each direction . as gravity is the external force applicable to the mobility calculation in the current formalism , only displacements in the z - direction",
    "are applied to the fd relation .",
    "additionally , average velocity profiles are calculated for each direction , first with constant shear rate , @xmath9 , and further studied to determine shear rate dependence .",
    "displacement measurements are further limited to the `` constant mobility and diffusivity '' ( cmd ) region , defined as the narrow range of radial coordinates such that the average vertical velocity is roughly independent on radial distance .",
    "the pdf of displacement distributions for each direction is presented .",
    "further , fluctuations in displacement are determined for each cylindrical direction , and studied as a function of time .",
    "radial displacement fluctuation is found to be sub - diffusive , while angular displacement fluctuation is found to be super - diffusive .",
    "vertical displacement fluctuation is purely diffusive within the time scales of the experiment , allowing for the validity of the fd relations used herein .",
    "all displacement fluctuations are reduced to functions of angular displacement , and the results are presented .",
    "such relationships permit scaling of the pdf curves with varying angular displacements due to changing shear rates .    utilizing the fd relations presented above ,",
    "the diffusivity and mobility in the z - direction are extracted from the tracer particle trajectories and the effective temperature is realized .",
    "this effective temperature is found to be independent of tracer particle properties , as shown in @xcite , and further independent of the slow - shear rate .",
    "moreover , the effective temperature may then be considered a physical variable that characterizes the jammed granular system , with respect to the generalization of the equilibrium statistical mechanics of boltzmann , as applied to non - equilibrium systems .",
    "we further study the limits within which this effective temperature may be a valid physical variable , as we determine mobility and diffusivity as a function of shear rate .",
    "while diffusivity appears independent of shear rate , even somewhat above the ` slow ' regime , mobility shows a clear decrease in magnitude as we explore shear rates above the slow regime , resulting in an increase in the effective temperature as a function of shear rate .    in this paper , we will further report the experimental detail of particle dynamics in @xcite .",
    "the outline is as follows :",
    "the experiment is performed using a three - dimensional ( 3d ) couette cell , as shown in fig .",
    "[ setup1 ] , [ setup2 ] and [ setup3 ] .",
    "the grains are confined between two cylinders of height @xmath10 cm .",
    "the inner cylinder is rotated via a motor , while the outer cylinder remains fixed .",
    "the walls of the cylinders , in contact with the grains , are roughened by means of a glued layer of identical granular material , thereby minimizing wall slip .",
    "the walls of the inner and outer cylinders are roughened by acrylic beads with diameter @xmath11 and @xmath12 mm , respectively . testing the experiment with a rough inner wall and a smooth outer wall resulted in packing crystallization .",
    "the grains are compacted by an external pressure of a specific value ( typically 386 pa ) , introduced by a moving piston at the top of the granular material , acting in the negative z - direction .",
    "observation techniques are used to monitor the granular packing evolution as it explores the available jammed configurations .",
    "the couette cell is sheared at the quasi - static limit , with slow frequencies @xmath13 mhz defining the external shear - rate @xmath14 @xmath15 , where @xmath16 cm and @xmath17 cm are the radius of the inner and outer cylinders , respectively , and @xmath18 is the angular velocity of the inner cylinder ( notice that @xmath19 and @xmath20 are measured after the walls are roughened by a glued layer of beads ) . the experiment is designed to measure the diffusivity and mobility of tracer particles @xcite , as opposed to tracking the motion of all constituent grains .",
    "the distance between the inner and outer cylinder is less than 10 grain diameters to prevent bulk shear band formation @xcite that may interfere with the experimental measurements by altering the diffusivity .    a refractive index matching suspending solution is employed in order to create a transparent sample .",
    "the suspending solution is also density matched to the grains in order to eliminate pressure gradients derived from gravity in the vertical direction , circumventing problems seen in previous experiments of compactivity @xcite and other effects such as convection and size segregation such as the brazil nut effect inside the cell @xcite .",
    "the solution used in this experiment is approximately 74% weight fraction of cyclohexyl bromide and 26% decalin @xcite .",
    "these steps avoids problems encountered in previous tests of compactivity .",
    "the granular system is a bidisperse , 1:1 by mass , mixture of spherical , transparent poly - methyl methacrylate ( acrylic ) particles , with density @xmath21 and index of refraction @xmath22 .",
    "the bidisperse mixture is used in an effort to inhibit crystallization of the system .",
    "the respective particle diameters are either @xmath23 mm and @xmath11 mm ( packing 1 ) or @xmath11 mm and @xmath24 mm ( packing 2 ) . the approximate same size ratio of each bidisperse packing leads to approximately the same value of volume fraction for both , being @xmath25 before shearing and @xmath26 during shearing .    a negative consequence of utilizing a suspending solution includes possible modification of the friction coefficient between the grains . while this can not be completely avoided , it is important to note that the liquid only partially fills the cell ( see fig .",
    "[ setup1 ] ) , such that the pressure of the piston is transmitted to the granular material exclusively , not to the fluid .",
    "additionally , hydrodynamic effects from partial cell filling are avoided by the extremely slow rotational speeds applied to our system .",
    "the system remains very closely packed , such that particles are not free to float in the fluid .",
    "therefore , the random motion of the particles is controlled by the ` jamming ' forces exerted by the contacts between neighboring grains , not fluid mechanics .",
    "cylindrical coordinates , @xmath0 , of tracer particles are obtained by analyzing images acquired by four digital cameras surrounding the couette cell . for systems in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "a fluctuation - dissipation ( fd ) relation may be utilized in an effort to calculate the bath temperature of the system .",
    "this method may be extended to non - equilibrium systems , such as jammed granular systems presented in this study .",
    "the fd relation is defined as follows :    @xmath27 ^ 2\\rangle \\sim 2 d \\delta t,\\ ] ]    @xmath28    @xmath27 ^ 2\\rangle = ~ 2 t_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize eff } } ~ \\frac{\\langle x(t+\\delta t ) - x(t)\\rangle } { f}. \\label{fdt}\\ ] ]    the tracer particles must experience a constant force , @xmath29 , in order to calculate the mobility as defined above .",
    "the most convenient constant , external , force , is gravity in the z - direction .",
    "if the effective temperature is to be regarded as an intensive variable of the non - equilibrium system , it requires independence from the tracer particles properties , and we present data in favor of this result .",
    "however , we acknowledge that temperature measures from multiple observables would be necessary to analyze the underlying thermodynamic meaning of @xmath8 .",
    "tracer particles added to the bulk must have properties unique from the grains comprising the bulk .",
    "however , tracer particles too small , or too large , with respect to the acrylic grains described previously , would result in erroneous measurements .",
    "dynamics of tracer particles that were too small would be dominated by `` percolation effects '' @xcite , resulting in larger than expected tracer particle displacements .",
    "those too large would require shear rates above the quasi - static limit we propose to study , or possibly have no dynamics at all due to size limitations . with these notions in mind ,",
    "two different types of tracers , nylon ( @xmath30 ) and delrin ( @xmath31 ) , are employed , which result in different external forces , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the densities of the acrylic particles and the tracers , respectively , @xmath35 is the volume of the tracer particle and @xmath36 the gravitational acceleration",
    ". variations in tracer particle diameter and density allow us to study dynamical changes due to a change in constant external force , while we remain within a range appropriate to achieve results expected to be governed by the effective temperature .",
    "four digital cameras symmetrically surround the shear cell to track the tracer particles with frame rate @xmath37 5 frame / s , as shown in fig .",
    "[ setup3 ] .",
    "the outer cylinder is made of the same material as the grains ( acrylic , @xmath38 ) .",
    "the refractive index is matched by the fluid such that the system can be regarded as an optical whole , i.e. , the light scattered from tracers refracts only once at the outer surface of the outer cylinder , as shown in fig .",
    "[ setup2 ] .",
    "the determination of the 3d tracer position is achieved by a simple calculation considering both system geometry and 2d projections captured by two adjacent cameras .",
    "camera calibration and determination of relative position is important as a minimal asymmetry will result in a large calculation error of the tracer particles coordinates , @xmath0 .",
    "as opposed to directly measuring relative positions of the cameras by physical devices , we utilize computer programming . in order to simplify the calculation",
    ", we assume the camera to be a pinhole , meaning all light coming into the camera coincides at a single focal point .    before each experiment , we record the images of a piece of grid paper attached to the surface of the outer cylinder , acting as the 2d projections of the outer cylinder for each camera .",
    "next , we adjust the positions of four cameras until each camera can give the approximately same 2d projections of the outer cylinder .",
    "then we use the computer program to generate a virtual cylinder , along with four virtual cameras , according to the geometry of the shear cell , in other words , we build a virtual space of the entire experimental setup and the respective geometrical relations between its elements .    from the previous calibration procedure",
    ", we have the relative positions of the four cameras to the shear cylinder with sufficient accuracy . in order to further calibrate and know the exact position of cameras , we adjust the relative position of cameras in our virtual space until the virtual 2d projection of the cylinder to the cameras coincides exactly with the actual projection , being the grid paper attached to the outer cylinder .",
    "when this procedure is accomplished , the virtual space exactly coincides with the real experimental setup space .",
    "therefore the virtual relative position of cameras are also the real positions .",
    "furthermore , in our virtual space , any point with 3d coordinates , @xmath39 , we can calculate its 2d coordinates in four virtual 2d projections , @xmath40 , by considering the geometry relation to cameras .",
    "oppositely , for any tracer particle , if we know its 2d coordinates in four 2d projections , @xmath40 , we can exactly locate its 3d positions , @xmath39 , since the virtual space is equal to the actual one .",
    "the resulting vertical trajectories of the tracers @xmath41 are depicted in fig .",
    "[ trajectory1 ] showing that the nylon tracers not only diffuse , but also move with a constant average velocity to the top of the cell .",
    "[ trajectory2 ] shows a typical trajectory of tracer particle in 3d plotting .",
    "we first study the velocity profiles for a fixed shear rate , @xmath9 , followed by a study on the shear rate dependence in the next section .",
    "the average velocity profiles in the angular direction , @xmath42 , in the vertical direction , @xmath43 , and in the radial direction , @xmath44 , are obtained by averaging the velocities of all tracer particles over all times at each radius @xmath45 , as shown in fig .",

    "this velocity is non - zero , so that the shear band is located right at the outer cylinder , avoiding the formation of shear bands in the bulk .    in order to avoid the tracer particles sticking to the outer cylinder surface and forcing its velocity to zero",
    ", we glue smaller size particles to roughen the outer cylinder .",
    "this roughens the surface of the outer cylinder and avoids crystallization .",
    "further , this allows slipping of the bulk particles at the outer cylinder , forcing the shear band to be located exactly at the outer cylinder , not in the bulk .",

    "further , it is possible to explore the configuration of states at a fixed volume , via experiment or simulation .",
    "the statistical mechanics is then derived using methods similar to boltzmann statistics for equilibrium systems . from these methods , one can obtain the compactivity , @xmath172 , as a derivative of the entropy with respect to the volume , enabling the calculation of an equation of state in the volume ensemble as follows .",
    "@xmath173    the compactivity , @xmath172 , is thereby assumed to be an equilibrium measure of a system within the framework of the volume ensemble , much like the bath temperature of the energy ensemble .",

    "this experiment is feasible due to the fact that it is always possible to prepare a system at a given volume fraction and will be the subject of future study and experiment , facilitated by recent theoretical findings @xcite .",
    "similar to the conservation of volume , boundary stress may also be a conserved quantity in jammed granular systems , and edwards statistical mechanics for volume distributions could be applied analogously to the distribution of boundary stresses , @xmath177 , or forces , referred to as the force ensemble @xcite .",
    "the angoricity , @xmath178 , is calculated as the derivative of the entropy with respect to the boundary stress , and an additional equation of state is thereby achieved as follows :    @xmath179    this result can be combined with that of the volume ensemble in an effort to accurately define the statistical mechanics of static jammed granular matter . such an approach remains a topic of ongoing research .",
    "however , slowly driven granular systems introduce yet another ensemble , the energy ensemble , from which the above defined @xmath8 is derived .",
    "while the above results reveal that @xmath8 does not tend to zero as the magnitude of the driving force decreases , indicating extrapolation to a non - zero static quantity , it remains unclear how the effective temperature may relate to the compactivity and angoricity as defined by edwards statistics .",

    "however , the input of energy by the external driving force brings the system to a steady state where the average energy is constant over the time - scale of the experiment .",

    "further , @xmath8 remains approximately constant with varying tracer particle size , implying a zero - th law of thermodynamics for slowly sheared jammed granular systems .",
