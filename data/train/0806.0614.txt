    "in two previous papers , hereafter denoted by i and ii,@xcite we considered various properties of clean itinerant helimagnets in their ordered phase at low temperatures . these papers considered and discussed in some detail the nature of the ordered state , and in particular the goldstone mode that results from the spontaneously broken symmetry .",
    "we also calculated a variety of electronic properties in the ordered state that are influenced by the goldstone mode or helimagnon , which physically amounts to fluctuations of the helical magnetization . for various observables , we found that couplings between electronic degrees of freedom and helimagnon fluctuations lead to a nonanalytic ( i.e. , non - fermi - liquid - like ) temperature dependence at low temperature .",
    "for most quantities , this takes the form of corrections to fermi - liquid behavior , but in some cases , e.g. , for the single - particle relaxation rate , the nonanalytic dependence constitutes the leading low - temperature behavior .",
    "a prototypical itinerant helimagnet is mnsi . at low temperatures and ambient pressure",
    ", the ground state of mnsi has helical or spiral order , where the magnetization is ferromagnetically ordered in the planes perpendicular to some direction @xmath2 , with a helical modulation of wavelength @xmath3 along the @xmath2 axis.@xcite mnsi displays helical order below a temperature @xmath4 at ambient pressure , with @xmath5 .",
    "that is , the pitch length scale is large compared to microscopic length scales .",
    "application of hydrostatic pressure @xmath6 suppresses @xmath7 , which goes to zero at a critical pressure @xmath8.@xcite physically , the helimagnetism is caused by the spin - orbit interaction , which breaks lattice inversion symmetry . in a landau theory this effect leads to a term of the form @xmath9 in the landau free energy , with @xmath10 the local magnetization , and a prefactor proportional to @xmath11.@xcite    in i and ii we used a technical description based on itinerant electrons subject to an effective inhomogeneous external field that represents helimagnetic order , with helimagnon fluctuations coupled to the remaining electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "we emphasize that for the theory developed in either papers i and ii , or in the current paper and a forthcoming paper iv , it is irrelevant whether the helimagnetism is caused by the conduction electrons , or whether the conduction electrons experience a background of helimagnetic order caused by electrons in a different band .",
    "the gaussian or ` non - interacting ' part of the action was not diagonal in either spin or wave number space , and the latter property reflected the fact that the system is inhomogeneous .",
    "these features substantially complicated the explicit calculations performed in ii . in order to make progress beyond the discussion in ii , and to discuss the effects of quenched disorder in particular",
    ", it therefore is desirable to find a technically simpler description . in the current paper ,",
    "our first main result is the construction of a canonical transformation that diagonalizes the action in spin space and simultaneously makes the gaussian action diagonal in wave number space .",
    "the new transformed action makes our previous calculations much simpler than before .",
    "it also enables us to extend our previous work in a number of ways .",
    "in particular , we will treat the much more complicated problem of the quasiparticle properties of helimagnets in the presence of non - magnetic quenched disorder .",
    "the study of the electronic properties of disordered metals has produced a variety of surprises over the past thirty years .",
    "the initial work on this subject was mostly related to diffusive electrons and the phenomena known as weak - localization and/or altshuler - aronov ( aa ) effects ( for reviews see , e.g. , refs .  ) . in the clean limit ,",
    "mode - mode coupling effects analogous to the aa effects have been shown to lead to a nonanalytic wave number dependence of the spin susceptibility at @xmath12.@xcite more recently , disordered interacting ( via a coulomb interaction ) electron systems have been studied in the ballistic limit , @xmath13 , but still at temperatures low compared to all energy scales other than @xmath0 , with @xmath14 the elastic scattering rate.@xcite interestingly , in this limit it has been shown that for two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems , the temperature correction to the elastic scattering rate is proportional to @xmath15 , i.e. , shows non - fermi liquid behavior . in contrast , in 3d systems the corresponding correction is proportional to @xmath16 , i.e. , the behavior is marginally fermi - liquid - like , with a logarithmic correction.@xcite the second main result of the current paper is that in the ballistic limit , the low - temperature correction to the single - particle relaxation rate in ordered helimagnets is linear in @xmath15 .",
    "the technical reason for why a 3d disordered itinerant helimagnet behaves in certain ways in close analogy to a 2d nonmagnetic disordered metal will be discussed in detail below .",
    "transport properties , in particular the electrical conductivity , will be considered in a separate paper , which we will refer to as paper iv.@xcite    the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] we introduce a canonical transformation that vastly simplifies the calculation of electronic properties in the helimagnet state . in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] we calculate various single - particle and quasiparticle properties at low temperatures in both clean and disordered helimagnetic systems . in the latter case we focus on the ballistic limit ( which is slightly differently defined than in nonmagnetic materials ) , where the various effects are most interesting , and which is likely of most experimental interest , given the levels of disorder in the samples used in previous experiments . the paper is concluded in sec.[sec : iv ] with a summary and a discussion . throughout this paper",
    "we will occasionally refer to results obtained in i and ii , and will refer to equations in these papers in the format ( i.x.y ) and ( ii.x.y ) , respectively .",
    "in this section we start with an electron action that takes into account helical magnetic order and helical magnetic fluctuations .",

    "we will see that there is a canonical transformation which leads , in terms of new grassmann variables , to an action that is diagonal in both spin and wave number space .",
    "this transformed action enormously simplifies calculations of the electronic properties of both clean and dirty helical magnetic metals .      in ii we derived an effective action for clean itinerant electrons in the presence of long - range helical magnetic order , and helical magnetic fluctuations interacting with the electronic degrees of freedom .",

    "rather , it removes the qualitative anisotropy characteristic of the unscreened potential in a rotationally invariant model , and introduces a term similar to one that is also generated by the spin - orbit interaction in a lattice model .",
    "we have used the transformed action to compute a number of the low - temperature quasiparticle properties in a helimagnet .",

    "we then added quenched nonmagnetic disorder to the action , and considered various single - particle observables in the ballistic limit .",
    "all of these results are new .",
    "the second important result in this paper is our calculation of the single - particle relaxation rate in systems with quenched disorder in the ballistic limit , @xmath135 , where we find a linear temperature dependence .",
    "this non - fermi - liquid result is to be contrasted with the previously derived @xmath136 leading term in clean helimagnets , and the usual @xmath137 behavior in clean fermi liquids .",
    "in paper iv of this series we will treat the interesting problem of transport in clean and weakly disordered electron systems with long - ranged helimagnetic order .",
    "specifically , we will use the canonical transformation introduced here to compute the electrical conductivity . in the clean limit",
    "we will recover the result derived previously in paper ii , while in the ballistic regime we find a leading temperature dependence proportional to @xmath15 . this linear term",
    "is directly related to the @xmath15-term found above for the single - particle relaxation rate . for the case of the electrical conductivity ,",
    "the @xmath15 term is much stronger than either the fermi liquid contribution ( @xmath137 ) or the contribution from the helimagnon scattering in the clean limit ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "a detailed discussion of the experimental consequences of these results will be given in paper iv . there",
    "we will also give a complete discussion of the limitations of our results , and in particular of the various temperature scales in the problem , including the one introduced by screening the effective potential .",
