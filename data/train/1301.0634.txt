    "we briefly explain our methods . in sections",
    "[ section_intro_rt ] , [ section_intro_lozenge ] , [ section_intro_asm ] , [ section_intro_loop ] , [ section_intro_matrix ] we describe the applications of our method in asymptotic representation theory , probability and statistical mechanics .",

    "we also apply the techniques developed here to the study of other classes of lozenge tilings @xcite and to the investigation of the asymptotic behavior of decompositions of tensor products of representations of classical groups into irreducible components @xcite .",
    "the main ingredient of our approach to the asymptotic analysis of symmetric functions is the following integral formula , which is proved in theorem [ theorem_integral_representation_schur_1 ] .",
    "let @xmath37 , and let @xmath3 ,  , @xmath38 be complex numbers . denote @xmath39 with @xmath40 @xmath41s in the numerator and @xmath5 @xmath41s in the denominator .    for any complex number @xmath42",

    "a normalized symmetric function is expressed as a contour integral with integrand being the product of elementary factors .",
    "the only exception is the most general case of jacobi polynomials , where we have to use certain hypergeometric series .    recently ( and independently of the present work ) a formula similar to for the characters of orthogonal groups @xmath47 was found in @xcite in the study of the mixing time of certain random walk on @xmath47 .",
    "a close relative of our formula can be also found in section 3 of @xcite .",
    "using formula we apply tools from complex analysis , mainly the method of steepest descent , to compute the limit behavior of these normalized symmetric functions .",
    "our main asymptotic results along these lines are summarized in propositions [ proposition_convergence_mildest ] , [ proposition_convergence_strongest ] , [ prop_convergence_gue_case ] for real @xmath42 and in propositions [ proposition_convergence_extended ] and [ prop_convergence_gue_extended ] for complex @xmath42 .    the next important step is the formula expressing @xmath48 in terms of @xmath49 which is proved in theorem [ theorem_multivariate_schur_1 ] :    we have @xmath50_{i , j=1}^{k } \\left(\\prod_{j=1}^k s_{\\lambda}(x_j;n,1)\\frac{(x_j-1)^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}\\right),\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the differential operator @xmath52 .",

    "since we deal with analytic functions and convergence in our formulas is always ( at least locally ) uniform , the differentiation in formula does not introduce any problems .",

    ". using these facts and applying the result above to @xmath19 we conclude that the normalized characters of @xmath19 are the functions @xmath67 for `` big '' groups such as @xmath18 the situation is more delicate .",

    "consider a tiling of a domain drawn on the regular triangular lattice of the kind shown at figure [ fig_polyg_domain ] with rhombi of 3 types , where each rhombus is a union of 2 elementary triangles .",
    "such rhombi are usually called _ lozenges _ and they are shown at figure [ figure_loz ] . the configuration of the domain is encoded by the number @xmath5 which is its width and @xmath5 integers @xmath110 which are the positions of _ horizontal lozenges _ sticking out of the right boundary . if we write @xmath111 , then @xmath28 is a signature of size @xmath5 , see left panel of figure [ fig_polyg_domain ] . due to combinatorial constraints the tilings of such domain are in correspondence with tilings of a certain polygonal domain , as shown on the right panel of figure [ fig_polyg_domain ]",
    "let @xmath112 denote the domain encoded by a signature @xmath28 .",
    "it is well  known that each lozenge tiling can be identified with a stepped surface in @xmath113 ( the three types of lozenges correspond to the three slopes of this surface ) and with a perfect matching of a subgraph of a hexagonal lattice , see e.g.@xcite .",
    "note that there are finitely many tilings of @xmath112 and let @xmath114 denote a uniformly random lozenge tiling of @xmath112 .",
    "the interest in lozenge tilings is caused by their remarkable asymptotic behavior .",
    "when @xmath5 is large the rescaled stepped surface corresponding to @xmath114 concentrates near a deterministic limit shape .",
    "in fact , this is true also for more general domains , see @xcite .",
    "one feature of the limit shape is the formation of so  called _ frozen regions _ ; in terms of tilings , these are the regions where asymptotically with high probability only single type of lozenges is observed .",
    "this effect is visualized in figure [ figure_hex ] , where a sample from the uniform measure on tilings of the simplest tilable domain  hexagon  is shown .",
    "it is known that in this case the boundary of the frozen region is the inscribed ellipse , see @xcite , for more general polygonal domains the frozen boundary is an inscribed algebraic curve , see @xcite and also @xcite .    in this article",
    "we study the local behavior of lozenge tiling near a _ turning point _ of the frozen boundary , which is the point where the boundary of the frozen region touches ( and is tangent to ) the boundary of the domain .",
    "okounkov and reshetikhin gave in @xcite a non - rigorous argument explaining that the scaling limit of a tiling in such situation should be governed by the _ gue ",
    "corners _ process ( introduced and studied by baryshnikov @xcite and johansson  nordenstam @xcite ) , which is the joint distribution of the eigenvalues of a gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue)random matrix ( i.e.  hermitian matrix with independent gaussian entries ) and of its top",
    " left corner square submatrices . in one model of tilings of infinite polygonal domains ,",
    "the proof of the convergence can be based on the determinantal structure of the correlation functions of the model and on the double  integral representation for the correlation kernel and it was given in @xcite . another rigorous argument , related to the asymptotics of _ orthogonal polynomials _ exists for the lozenge tilings of hexagon ( as in figure [ figure_hex ] ) , see @xcite , @xcite .",

    "( horizontal lozenges are shown in blue in the left panel of figure [ fig_polyg_domain ] . )",
    "we set @xmath116 and denote the resulting random signature @xmath117 of size @xmath13 as @xmath118 .",

    "then for every @xmath13 as @xmath25 we have @xmath124 in the sense of weak convergence , where @xmath125    under the same assumptions as in theorem [ theorem_gue_intro ] the ( rescaled ) joint distribution of @xmath126 horizontal lozenges on the left @xmath13 lines weakly converges to the joint distribution of the eigenvalues of the @xmath13 top - left corners of a @xmath36 matrix from a gue ensemble .",
    "note that , in principle , our domains may approximate a non  polygonal limit domain as @xmath25 , thus , the results of @xcite describing the limit shape in terms of algebraic curves are not applicable here and not much is known about the exact shape of the frozen boundary . in particular , even the explicit expression for the coordinate of the point where the frozen boundary touches the left boundary ( which we get as a side result of theorem [ theorem_gue_intro ] ) seems not to be present in the literature .",
    "our approach to the proof of theorem [ theorem_gue_intro ] is the following : we express the expectations of certain observables of uniformly random lozenge tilings through normalized schur polynomials @xmath127 and investigate the asymptotics of these polynomials . in this case",
    "we prove and use the following asymptotic expansion ( given in proposition [ prop_convergence_gue_case ] and proposition [ gue_multivar_asymptotics ] ) @xmath128    we believe that our approach can be extended to a natural @xmath0deformation of uniform measure , which assigns the weight @xmath129 to lozenge tiling with volume @xmath130 below the corresponding stepped surface ; and also to lozenge tilings with axial symmetry , as in @xcite , @xcite . in the latter cases the schur polynomials are replaced with characters of orthogonal or symplectic groups and the limit object also changes . we postpone the thorough study of these cases to a future publication .",
    "we note that there might be another approach to the proof of theorem [ theorem_gue_intro ] .",
