    "galaxy groups are interesting astrophysical systems that bridge the gap between isolated , single galaxies and massive galaxy clusters .",
    "a large fraction of all galaxies reside in this special transition regime ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where the effects of baryonic physics can be investigated .",
    "in fact , while in the inner region of galaxies the total mass distribution is dominated by baryons ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and in clusters of galaxies dark matter is the main mass component outside their central cores ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the interplay between baryonic and dark matter is expected to play a key role in shaping galaxy groups , that are composed by a few gravitationally bound galaxies . despite the recognised cosmological relevance of studies in groups of galaxies , the physical properties of these systems are still relatively unexplored .",
    "galaxy groups at low and intermediate redshifts have been investigated by means of x - ray and optical diagnostics ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and only more recently some gravitational lensing analyses in galaxy groups have also become available ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the modest number of known groups of galaxies showing strong lensing features and the smallness of the weak lensing signal ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) produced by these objects make detailed lens modelling at these mass scales particularly valuable .",
    "strong lensing , in combination with multiband photometry or galaxy dynamics , can be exploited to disentangle the group luminous and dark components , in the same way as in single galaxies and clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in suitable lensing systems ,",
    "the extended luminosity distribution of the multiple images has also allowed to estimate the halo truncation radii of specific group members , showing the importance of tidal stripping processes in the structural evolution of galaxies located in overdense environments ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . moreover , the fairly high lensing magnification factors achieved in galaxy groups have offered the possibility of studying in detail the physical properties ( like the star formation rate , the chemical abundance and composition ) of distant lensed galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    by means of different observational and selection criteria , galaxy groups acting as strong gravitational lenses on background sources",
    "have been identified in the cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , strong lensing legacy survey ( sl2s ; @xcite ) , and cambridge sloan survey of wide arcs in the sky ( cassowary ; @xcite ) . for example",
    ", the class survey has discovered through radio observations one system composed of two images , separated by 4.56 in projection , of a radio - loud quasar lensed by a massive early - type galaxy with a satellite galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "the other two surveys have concentrated on using optical multicolor images ( from the canada france hawaii telescope legacy survey , cfhtls , and sloan digital sky survey , sdss ) to find potential lensed ( blue ) objects located around groups of massive ( red ) galaxies .",
    "several of these photometrically selected systems have been spectroscopically followed up to validate the lensing hypothesis and to estimate the redshifts of the lenses and sources .    in this work ,",
    "we concentrate on the system number five ( cswa 5 ) of the cassowary catalogue .",
    "as for all systems in the cassowary survey , _ ugriz _ imaging from the sdss is available . from a colour - composite image ( see @xcite ) , it is possible to distinguish two similar red galaxies ( l1 and l2 , at a projected angular distance of 5.27 ) , one of which has a sdss spectrum showing absorption features redshifted at @xmath22 , and four faint blue images ( im1-im4 ) at projected angular distances of a few arcsececonds ( the lens galaxies and the multiple images are labelled in the second panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "three of these images have been observed with the x - shooter spectrograph at the very large telescope ( vlt ) and have been verified to be the lensed multiple images of a star - forming galaxy located at redshift @xmath23 .",
    "the excellent spectral resolution and wavelength coverage of the x - shooter instrument , combined with the lensing magnification effect , have allowed a refined study of the physical properties of this distant source ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the study presented here focuses on the characterization of the lens galaxies and completes the previous analysis of this lensing system . in the following",
    ", we will provide realistic lensing modelling and measure the luminous and dark matter components of the deflector .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , we use photometric redshift estimators to prove that the data for the two red galaxies are consistent with l1 and l2 being at the same redshift . in sect .",
    "3 , we develop strong lensing models for the cswa 5 system , under the assumptions that the two galaxies are both lenses at the same redshift @xmath22 and that the four images are all multiple images of the same blue source at @xmath23 .",
    "then , in sect .",
    "4 , we fit the sdss multiband photometry of the two lenses with composite stellar population templates to derive the galaxy luminous masses and compare these values to the total mass estimates provided by the strong lensing analysis . this piece of information is employed to estimate the amount and distribution of dark matter in the galaxies . finally , in sect . 5",

    "the sdss provides one of the largest multi - color ( @xmath37 ) imaging catalogue available to date . by using the sdss five - band photometry , that covers a wavelength range from 354 to 913 nm , an approximate redshift ( called photometric redshift or photo - z ) of each galaxy in the survey",
    "can be estimated .",
    "we refer in the following to the three different photo - z estimators included in the sdss database and identify them as @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the photometric redshift estimates are all determined from dereddened total magnitudes , that provide unbiased galaxy colours in absence of colour gradients .",
    "the @xmath38 estimator assigns a redshift to a galaxy by fitting its observed broadband filter fluxes with redshift - evolved spectral energy distribution ( sed ) templates , that are calibrated with a training sample of objects with photometric data and spectroscopic redshifts ( for further details see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the other two estimators employ the artificial neural network technique to derive empirically a relation between photometric observables and redshifts in a training set of photometrically and spectroscopically observed galaxies . from this relation , the redshifts of the galaxies with only photometric data",
    "can then be obtained . as input parameters",
    ", @xmath39 uses the four colors @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 and the three concentration indices in the @xmath45 filters , @xmath40 the five @xmath37 magnitudes and concentration indices ( for definitions and details see @xcite ) .",
    "template - fitting and empirical methods have different advantages and disadvantages .",
    "the former can be applied to galaxies with a wide range of redshifts and intrinsic colours and provide , in addition to redshift estimates , rest - frame magnitudes as well , the latter are independent from systematical errors in the photometric calibrations of the data . by contrast , template - fitting techniques require a large set of galaxy seds and are affected by systematics due to calibration , empirical techniques need a training set of galaxies with photometric and spectroscopic properties that resemble those of the galaxies in the sample to be studied . for these reasons ,",
    "we consider here estimators of different kind .    in table",
    "[ tab4 ] , we show that each of the three estimators @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 provides for the two lens galaxies , l1 and l2 , photometric redshift values that are consistent within the errors .",
    "given the robustness of the considered photo - z estimators , that have been calibrated on several thousands of galaxies in the sdss , in the remainder of this paper we will approximate the deflector with a thin lens formed by two main mass components located at the same distance . to test the hypothesis that l1 and l2 reside in a collapsed galaxy group , we will proceed in the following sections to construct a lens model and disentangle the luminous and dark matter components . a possible evidence of the deflector being a galaxy group would be a dark over total mass fraction in these lens galaxies larger than in isolated lens galaxies .",

    "in this section we use the public software gravlenskeeton / gravlens/ ] ( @xcite ) to perform a strong lensing analysis of the cswa 5 system , focussing in particular on the determination of the total mass properties of the deflector .",
    "we model the source and the multiple images as point - like objects and the projected total mass distribution of the main lenses ( i.e. , the galaxies l1 and l2 of table [ tab1 ] ) in terms of either axisymmetric de vaucouleurs ( dev ) or singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) profiles , without and with an external shear ( es ) component ( for more details on the models , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these models are parametrised by the values of two length scales ( @xmath48 ) , related to the values of the einstein angles of the lenses , and of the external shear intensity ( @xmath49 ) and position angle ( @xmath50 ) . given the quality of our deepest image ( i.e. , the x - shooter acquisition image shown in @xcite , with an instrumental pixel size of 0.173",
    ", we consider conservative positional errors , @xmath31 , of 0.1 on the values of the centroids , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , of the lensed images ( see table [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "we measure that the average value of the angular distances @xmath53 of the multiple images from the centre of the primary lens l1 is 2.38 ( corresponding to 12.6 kpc ) .",
    "we fix the centres of mass of the lenses to their centres of light and , for the dev models , the effective angles @xmath54 to the values of table [ tab1 ] , obtained by fitting de vaucouleurs profiles to the sdss _",

    "this result suggests that with this level of uncertainty on the image positions there is no need to consider additional parameters to the relatively simple ( axisymmetric with fixed centres ) total mass models adopted for the deflector .",
    "the @xmath55 values show that sis profiles are from 2 to 4 times more likely than dev profiles to describe the projected total mass distributions of the two lens galaxies .",
    "this provides some evidence that the projected total mass of the lenses is less concentrated than their light . the small intensity and the position angle of the external shear are consistent and rather well oriented with the possible effect and orientation of the few galaxies that have sdss colours or photometric redshifts comparable to those of l1 and l2 and are angularly close to them .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we plot for the best - fit ( and most likely ) sis@xmath58es model the source plane with the caustics and the reconstructed position of the lensed source , the image plane with the critical curves and the observed and reconstructed positions of the multiple images , the predicted fermat potential with its stationary points , and magnification map ( for definitions , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we remark that in addition to the accurate reproduction of the four image positions , the image magnification factors are also in qualitative agreement with the observations . a more quantitative comparison between the observed and model - predicted image fluxes would require a deeper and better angularly resolved image of the lensing system .",
    "we notice that the best - fit model predicts magnification factors larger than 2 for all observed multiple images , resulting in a total magnification factor of approximately 17 , and a fifth demagnified image that is located angularly very close to the center of l2 .",
    "we use galfit ( @xcite ) on the x - shooter acquisition image to model the surface brightness distribution of l2 with a sersic profile , keeping the centre fixed and fitting the values of sersic index , effective angle , ellipticity , and its position angle .",
    "galfit includes a model of the psf shape when fitting galaxy morphologies .",
    "however , in the 20 s integration time for our image there are only two stars in the field which are of the same magnitude or slightly fainter than l2 , and therefore not optimal for modelling the psf . after subtracting the model , the residuals within 1 @xmath27from the centre of l2 are consistent with the noise in the frame .",
    "we conclude that deeper data are necessary to detect the possible presence of a fifth image of the source .",
    "we also scan the 3-diameter fiber - spectrum of l2 from the sdss but do not find any significantly high s / n emission line that can be associated to some light coming from the possible fifth image and entering in the fibre aperture .",
    "this is not worrying since this predicted additional image is expected to be more than four times fainter than the faintest observed image ( im4 ) .",
    "moreover , we investigate the possibility of having a three instead of a five multiple - image system , as theoretically studied by @xcite in cases where two main mass concentrations are located on the same lens plane . we reconsider our lensing models with only the spectroscopically confirmed im1 , im2 , and im3 .",
    "we find best - fit @xmath55 values on the order of @xmath59 .",
    "this fact , combined with the good level with which the four image positions and magnifications can be reproduced , supports the hypothesis that this lensing system is more likely composed of a source that is lensed five times .    ) on the image plane where the absolute value of the magnification factor ( @xmath60 ) of the best - fit sis+es model is larger than a certain threshold ( @xmath61 ) ( in black ) . for comparison with single lens systems ,",
    "the same function is plotted using the previous best - fit values , removing the lens galaxy l2 , and considering only l1 ( in grey).,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we show for the best - fit sis+es model the area on the image plane where the magnification factor @xmath60 has an absolute value that is larger than some fixed limits .",
    "we also compare the extensions of the highly magnified regions to those of lensing systems composed of isolated massive lens galaxies . by using the same best - fit model parameters and excluding l2",
    ", we find that l1 alone would produce the same magnification factors on approximately four times smaller areas .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we remark that deflectors composed by more than one mass concentration can act as efficient gravitational telescopes , providing large magnification factors on fairly extended areas of the sky .",
    "this fact is particularly relevant for astrophysical studies on high - redshift sources ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) that , without lensing , would otherwise not be observable with the present technology .     and",

    "the contour levels indicate the 68% and 95% confidence regions and the thick bars the 68% confidence interval obtained by excluding the 320 smallest and largest best - fit values .",
    "a plus symbol locates the best - fit ( minimum @xmath55 ) values of the two parameters corresponding to the values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 of table [ tab3].,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    to quantify the statistical errors and degeneracy of the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 , we perform a bootstrapping analysis by resampling the observed image positions according to their adopted positional errors and minimising the positional @xmath55 over the sis+es model parameters .",
    "we convert the best - fit values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 obtained from 2000 random data sets into effective velocity dispersion values @xmath63 and @xmath62 for the two lenses .",
    "we remind that for a sis model the values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 are related in the following way : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the light speed and @xmath68 and @xmath69 are , respectively , the angular diameter distances between the lens and the source and the observer and the source .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the results of this analysis .",
    "we observe that the values of the two parameters @xmath63 and @xmath62 are clearly anticorrelated .",
    "this follows from the fact that the geometrical configuration of the multiple images provides a very precise estimate of the projected total mass enclosed within a cylinder with radius given by the average distance ( @xmath70 from table [ tab2 ] ) of the images from the centre of the primary lens ( l1 ) .",
    "keeping this mass value fixed , an increment in the mass ( or equivalently @xmath63 ) contribution of l1 must be compensated by a decrement in the mass ( or equivalently @xmath62 ) term of l2 , and viceversa .",
    "moreover , we remark that the vicinity of the four images to l1 results in a more precise measurement of the value of @xmath63 ( i.e. , @xmath0 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "the 68% confidence level interval ( obtained by excluding from the 2000 best - fit values the 320 smallest and largest values ) for @xmath62 gives effective velocity dispersion values between 332 and 367 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the sdss 3-diameter spectrum of l2 yields an estimate of the stellar velocity dispersion of @xmath71 km s@xmath2 ( @xcite ) , that rescaled to an aperture radius of @xmath72 results in a central stellar velocity dispersion @xmath73 of @xmath74 km s@xmath2 .",
    "in contrast to isolated lens galaxies , where the values of their effective and central stellar velocity dispersions are consistent within the errors ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the lensing measurement of the velocity dispersion of l2 is here fairly larger than the dynamical one .",
    "this can be a hint for the presence of a larger amount of dark matter in the galaxies of this system .",
    "the additional dark matter component might be associated to the haloes of the galaxies residing in an overdense environment or to a diffused dark matter halo , extended on radial scales larger than those typical of single galaxies ( as in galaxy groups and clusters ) .",
    "we will come back to this point in the next section .",
    "finally , we check whether we can estimate the values of the tidal radii of the two lens galaxies , as done in recent strong lensing studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude that point - like images do not contain enough information to measure these physical scales .",
    "future detailed photometric observations , providing the extended surface brightness distribution of the multiple images , would be very useful to address this last point .",
    "in this section we combine the results obtained above from the strong lensing modelling with those coming from a multiband photometric analysis on the lens galaxies , to infer their dark matter content .",
    "first , we estimate the composition of l1 and l2 in terms of their luminous mass .",
    "we model the five _ ugriz _ extinction - corrected modelmag magnitudes taken from the sdss and listed in table [ tab1 ] with composite stellar population models , by using the photometric redshift code hyperz ( @xcite ) . for the fits",
    ", we fix the redshifts of l1 and l2 to the spectroscopic value measured for l2 ( see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "we adopt @xcite templates with a delayed exponential star formation history ( for more details on the method and on its reliability , see @xcite ) . following the results of several recent studies on massive early - type galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) , we adopt a @xcite stellar initial mass function .",
    "we find that the total luminous mass values for l1 and l2 are @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "these correspond to stellar mass - to - light ratio values in the observed @xmath9-band of @xmath75 and @xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "the galaxy spectral energy distributions with the best - fit models are plotted in fig .",
    ".         then , we simulate 2000 luminous mass distributions for the two lens galaxies by choosing de vaucouleurs profiles and taking into account the errors on the total luminous masses .",
    "we measure the projected luminous mass values inside cylinders centred on l1 and with radii going from 0.5 to 5 by adding over these regions the contributions from l1 and l2 .",
    "we obtain that inside the average distance of the four multiple images from l1 the projected luminous mass is @xmath76 . the projected cumulative luminous mass with the 1 @xmath65 confidence level errors is shown in fig . [ fig4 ] .",
    "next , by using the results coming from the bootstrapping analysis described in the previous section , we determine the projected total mass values inside the same aperture radii defined for the projected luminous mass estimates .",
    "we employ the 2000 best - fit values of the @xmath56 and @xmath57 parameters to measure the projected total mass distributions of the two lens galaxies and sum their contributions .",
    "we find that inside an aperture of 2.38 the projected total mass is @xmath77 .",
    "the projected cumulative total mass with the 1 @xmath65 confidence level errors is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we also plot the projected total to luminous mass ratio .",
    "this quantity is significantly larger than one at all radii , implying the presence of a remarkable dark matter component in addition to the luminous one . in detail , at the average distance of the multiple images from l1 the fraction of projected dark over total mass is @xmath78 .",
    "an angular distance of 2.38 from the lens centre corresponds to approximately 1.3 times the value of the galaxy effective angle ( see table [ tab1 ] ) . at this rescaled distance ( @xmath79 ) , a high value of @xmath80 such as that found in this lens galaxy",
    "is extremely uncommon in isolated lens ( and non - lens ) massive early - type galaxies ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this fact , combined with the observational evidence of a statistically significant amount of dark matter already at distances smaller than 1@xmath27 from the centre of l1 , supports the picture that the deflector of this system is a galaxy group .",
    "deeper multiband images , with a better angular resolution , would offer the opportunity of testing whether , as in galaxy clusters , the dark matter component is distributed on a spatial scale larger than that typical of single galaxies .",
    "a different way of establishing the presence of a large amount of dark matter in the central regions of these galaxies consists in comparing the values of stellar and total mass - to - light ratios within the galaxy effective radii .",
    "we measure projected total ( stellar and dark ) mass - to - light ratios of @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xmath8 , respectively , for l1 and l2 .",
    "these values are significantly larger than the stellar mass - to - light ratios reported above ( and typical of early - type galaxies ) . from this result",
    ", we can further exclude at a very high statistical level that the lens galaxies are composed of only luminous matter .    to investigate possible galaxy structural differences related to the environment in which lenses reside , we consider two samples , each composed of 10 galaxies , from the slacs survey with the 10 closest luminous mass values ( taken from @xcite ) to those of l1 and l2 . @xcite",
    "have shown that although the slacs galaxies ( being mainly massive early - type galaxies ) prefer overdense environments , less than 20% of them belong to a group or a cluster . in the same study",
    ", it has also been measured that the contribution of the environment to the potential of the slacs lenses is no more than a few per cent . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we contrast the average physical scales of the typically field lens galaxies in the two slacs samples with those of the lens galaxies l1 and l2 . we show that at fixed luminous mass the values of the effective velocity dispersions of the best - fit isothermal models in these lens galaxies are significantly larger than in field lens galaxies .",
    "we also observe that the values of the effective radii measured in the _",
    "i_-band reference frame at the redshift of l1 and l2 are for these lens galaxies larger than for field lens galaxies with similar luminous masses .",
    "moreover , we find that the ratio between the total ( estimated by assuming an isothermal model ) and luminous masses projected within a cylinder with radius equal to the effective radius is considerably larger in these than in field lens galaxies , at comparable luminous masses .    the third panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] proves quantitatively that l1 and l2 contain , within their effective radii , an approximately factor four larger amount of dark matter than field lens galaxies with similar luminous masses . in passing , we mention that a much larger sample of non - lens massive early - type galaxies selected from the sdss show projected dark over total mass fractions consistent with those of the slacs lenses plotted here ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the first and second panel of the same figure suggest that not only the total but also the luminous properties of the galaxies are significantly affected by the different environmental characteristics and concentration of dark matter .",

    "we have investigated the gravitational lensing system cswa 5 composed of two massive early - type galaxies at redshift 0.388 acting as main lenses on a source at redshift 1.069 .",
    "four lensed images of this source are observed at an average angular distance from the primary lens galaxy of 2.38 . by modelling the total mass distributions of the two galaxies with singular isothermal sphere profiles",
    ", we have shown that the geometry of the multiple image system can be accurately reproduced .",
    "we have then combined the total mass estimates provided by the lens modelling with the luminous mass measurements obtained by fitting with composite stellar population models the sdss multicolor photometry of the lens galaxies .",
    "this has allowed us to explore the dark matter content of these galaxies .",
    "the main results of this study can be summarized as follows :    * the projected total mass distribution of the two lens galaxies is described better by isothermal than de vaucouleurs profiles , showing that the galaxy projected total mass is less concentrated than light . *",
    "the effective velocity dispersion values of the isothermal models of l1 and l2 are anticorrelated , can be measured with a good precision , and are @xmath83 and @xmath84 km s@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the latter is larger than the galaxy central stellar velocity dispersion value ( @xmath74 km s@xmath2 ) . *",
    "according to the best - fit lens model , each observed multiple image is magnified by a factor larger than 2 and the total magnification of the lensed source is approximately 17 . * assuming a salpeter stellar initial mass function , the modelling of the galaxy spectral energy distributions provides luminous mass values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xmath5 for l1 and l2 , respectively .",
    "* the total and luminous masses projected within a cylinder centred on l1 and with radius of 12.6 kpc , given by the average distance of the multiple images from l1 , are @xmath85 and @xmath86 @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "this implies a projected dark over total mass ratio of approximately @xmath87 at an angular distance of only 1.3 times the value of the effective radius of l1 . * in the observed @xmath9-band , the values of the stellar mass - to - light ratio of l1 and l2 are , respectively , @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xmath8 . within the effective radii of l1 and l2 , the values of the projected total mass - to - light ratio are @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xmath8 , respectively",
    "this excludes , at a very high confidence level , a composition of the two galaxies in terms of luminous mass only . *",
    "the galaxies l1 and l2 show an amount of dark matter in their internal regions almost four times larger than in field lens galaxies with similar luminous masses .",
    "this fact is consistent with both galaxies residing in a galaxy group .",
    "the effective radii of these two galaxies are also larger than in comparable isolated lens galaxies .",
    "these results provide some observational evidence on the different galaxy evolution processes taking place in overdense and more dark matter - concentrated environments .",
    "a deeper image with a better angular resolution could provide interesting information on the model - predicted presence of a fifth demagnified image , on the values of the tidal radii of the lens galaxies , and on the radial scale of the dark matter distribution .",
    "our findings offer interesting information about the physical processes that determine the formation of structures in the universe .",
    "extending studies of this kind to more strong lensing systems living in disparate environments and comparing the observational results with those coming from ( baryons+dark matter ) cosmological simulations would greatly help us understanding the intricate mechanisms that are responsible for the mass assembly and structural evolution of galaxies .",
    "we thank matthew auger , raphael gobat , and tommaso treu for useful discussions .",
