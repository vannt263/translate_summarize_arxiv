    "we denote by @xmath2 the set of all @xmath9 unitary matrices .",
    "@xmath2 is a real algebraic variety and a smooth manifold of real dimension @xmath10 . for the purpose of this paper a unitary space time constellation ( or code ) @xmath11 is simply a finite subset of @xmath2 , @xmath12 we say @xmath11 has dimension @xmath0 and size @xmath1 .",
    "unitary space time codes have been intensely studied in recent years and we refer the interested readers to  @xcite and the references of these papers .",
    "the readers will find the motivation and engineering applications of such kind of codes .",
    "the quality of a unitary space time code is governed by two important parameters , the diversity product and the diversity sum .    the _ diversity product _",
    "@xcite of a unitary space time code @xmath11 is defined through @xmath13 the _ diversity sum _",
    "@xcite is defined as @xmath14    @xmath11 is called fully diverse if @xmath15 .",
    "as explained in  @xcite , a space time code with large diversity sum tends to perform well at low signal to noise ratios whereas a code with a large diversity product tends to perform well at high signal to noise ratios .",
    "a major coding design problem is the construction of unitary space time codes where the diversity sum ( or product ) is optimal or near optimal inside the set of all the space time codes with the same parameters @xmath16 .",
    "we would like to remark that for every positive integer @xmath0 and @xmath1 , a haar distributed random space time code is fully diverse with probability @xmath17 .",
    "a simple proof can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to derive for @xmath0 and @xmath1 tight upper bounds for the diversity product @xmath18 and the diversity sum @xmath19 .",
    "when @xmath20 then trivially @xmath21 and it follows that @xmath22 in this situation .",
    "the following lemma states that for every space time code @xmath11 , @xmath19 is an upper bound for @xmath18 and by having an upper bound for @xmath19 we immediately also have an upper bound for @xmath18 .",
    "the readers can find the statements about the relationship between @xmath18 and @xmath19 in  @xcite , for completeness we include a detailed proof .",
    "for any unitary space time code @xmath11 , @xmath23    let @xmath24 be an @xmath9 complex matrix with singular value decomposition @xmath25 where @xmath26 are unitary matrices and @xmath27 for @xmath28 are the singular values of @xmath24 .",
    "first we are going to prove @xmath29 if @xmath30 for some @xmath31 , then the inequality is trivial .",
    "hence we assume @xmath32 for all @xmath31 s . because @xmath26 are unitary matrices",
    ", it follows that @xmath33 similarly one verifies that @xmath34 applying cauchy - schwarz inequality , we have @xmath35 hence one concludes that for an @xmath9 square matrix @xmath24 , @xmath29 by the definition of @xmath18 , @xmath19 and the above inequality one gets @xmath23    of course it would be desirable to know for every @xmath0 and @xmath1 what the largest possible value of @xmath19 is .",
    "this is the motivation of the following definition .",
    "let @xmath36 be the infimum of all numbers such that for every unitary space time code @xmath11 of dimension @xmath0 and size @xmath1 , one has @xmath37    as pointed out by liang and xia  @xcite there exists a constellation @xmath11 of dimension @xmath0 and size @xmath1 with @xmath38 .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath39 is a compact manifold .",
    "the exact values of @xmath40 are only known in very few special cases . in the case @xmath20 ,",
    "one checks that @xmath41 for @xmath42 . when @xmath43 and @xmath44 , one has @xmath45 . when @xmath46 , we have @xmath47 for @xmath43 . for @xmath48 ,",
    "the following values were computed in  @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one interesting fact about the limiting behavior of @xmath49 ( when @xmath50 ) is its connection to the kepler problem  @xcite .",
    "certainly one can use kepler density  @xcite to obtain a tighter bound of the diversity sum asymptotically .",
    "we presented three approaches to derive upper bounds for the diversity sum of unitary constellations of any dimension @xmath0 and any size @xmath1 .",
    "the derived bounds seem to improve the existing bounds when @xmath48 and @xmath51 .",
    "when @xmath0 is large the exact computation of @xmath52 is rather involved and hence it is also computationally difficult to compute the bounds ( b1 ) and ( b2 ) .",
    "nonetheless it is our belief that the resulting upper bounds ( b1 ) and ( b2 ) become fairly tight as soon as @xmath1 is sufficiently large .",
    "it was pointed out that the resulted upper bounds also apply for the diversity product , although the bounds seem to be less tight in this situation .",
    "the future work may involve the derivation of a tighter upper bound analysis for the diversity product of unitary constellations using differential geometric means .",
