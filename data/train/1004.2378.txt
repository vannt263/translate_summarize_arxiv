    "an important constraint on cosmological models is the evolution of the hubble parameter , which is defined as : @xmath2 most tests of cosmology use measures of the luminosity distance or the angular diameter distance , which include an integral over @xmath0 , but measuring @xmath0 directly can potentially provide a more direct constraint on cosmological parameters ( jimenez & loeb 2002 ) .",
    "@xmath0 can be determined at high redshifts by measuring the time - interval , @xmath3 , corresponding to a redshift interval , @xmath4 , to obtain an approximation of the derivative in equation ( 1 ) .",

    "most recently , stern et al .",
    "( 2010 ) extended the studies of jimenez et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to a larger , more homogeneous sample to make the measurement of h(z ) from lrgs .",
    "jimenez & loeb ( 2002 ) suggested using spectroscopic age - dating of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) to measure @xmath5 .",
    "lrgs are galaxies selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york et al . 2000 ) by apparent magnitude to trace the evolution of a homogeneous , volume - limited sample of red galaxies ( eisenstein et al .",
    "jimenez et al . ( 2003 ) used lrgs from the sdss to measure @xmath6 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 ( the hubble parameter at z=0 ) .",
    "simon et al .",
    "( 2005 ) used the same method to find @xmath0 as a function of redshift for @xmath8 . in both cases , the authors assume that lrgs are drawn from the same parent population with the bulk of their stars formed at high redshift and fit single - burst equivalent ages to the galaxies .",
    "although there is evidence that lrgs make up a fairly homogeneous population of galaxies consisting mostly of old populations , roseboom et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have shown that this is not completely true . furthermore , barber et al .",
    "( 2007 ) find that these galaxies have a range of formation ages and stellar histories .",
    "jimenez and loeb ( 2002 ) note that galaxies would not have formed at exactly the same time and explore what effect this would have on one s ability to discriminate between different models for w(z ) .",
    "they do not , however , discuss the consequences of star formation being extended over a period in each galaxy ( they assume all stars form at exactly the same time in a galaxy ) .",
    "this extended star formation history ( sfh ) needs to be considered when one defines and measures an age for a galaxy . in jimenez et al ( 2003 ) ,",
    "the question is addressed in a little more detail : they simulate lrg spectra and add a contribution from a small fraction of stars formed at late times ; they then age - date the galaxies and conclude that the age `` edge '' is not significantly different from the theoretical expectation .",
    "they do not attempt to quantify what uncertainties arise as a result of the extended star formation .    given the importance of correct estimates of uncertainties on the measured h(z ) ,",
    "we explore , in this paper , the uncertainties that arise from lrgs having extended and varied sfhs .",
    "we use lrgs identified in the millennium simulation ( ms , springel et al .",
    "2005 ) since the only way to reliably determine uncertainties is in a simulation where the sfh and input cosmology are known .",
    "the ms is currently one of the most detailed simulations of the evolution of galaxies and large - scale structure and has been tuned to reflect observational data .",
    "almeida et al . ( 2008 ) studied lrgs in simulations and showed that the luminosity function and the clustering of lrgs are reasonably well - modelled in their semi - analytical models of galaxy evolution , which also reproduce many other observables .",
    "the parameters of the de lucia et al .",
    "( 2006 ) semi - analytical model have also been successfully tuned to match the luminosity , colour , and morphology of local elliptical galaxies , the more massive candidates of which would be lrgs .",
    "on the other hand , galaxies are not modelled perfectly in the simulations : there are indications that model galaxies assemble later than observations may suggest ( collins et al .",
    "2009 ) but more reliable estimates of stellar mass are required .",
    "it should be noted that these models overestimate the small amount of evolution seen in the properties of lrgs ( wake et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ) and likely over predict the amount of growth occurring in these sources ( masjedi et al .",
    "specifically for lrgs , barber et al .",
    "( 2007 ) find similar star formation rates , but younger ages than the de lucia models .",
    "in addition , properties of local galaxies can be reproduced with different models for galaxy formation ( e.g. kere et al . 2009 ) .",
    "however , the simulations provide viable models of extended sfhs , allowing us to quantify associated uncertainties and optimize analysis methods before applying them to observational data .    in this paper , we optimize the selection of lrgs based on their properties in the ms and examine how well @xmath0 can be recovered from their mass - weighted age .",
    "to explore and quantify the uncertainties associated with extended sfhs , we then investigate how well @xmath0 can be determined , if the mass - weighted age of these lrgs were measurable , using three different methods . in practice ,",
    "mass - weighted ages are not directly measurable and accurate age - dating using lrg spectra is potentially a bigger challenge for the cosmic chronometer approach .",
    "we carry out an initial study of age - dating , and its implications for @xmath0 measurements , using the stellar population models of bruzual & charlot ( bc2003 , 2003 ) to synthesize spectra .",
    "in contrast to fitting only single stellar population models ( ssps ) ( e.g. simon et al . 2005 ) or dual - burst population models ( jimenez et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ) to determine the lrg spectral ages , we make a comparison of ssp results to those using more complicated sfhs . in a companion paper ( olivier et al .",
    "2009 ) , we delve much deeper into issues of age - dating galaxy spectra .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in  [ sec : sims ] we discuss the extraction of lrgs from the ms . in  [ sec : cosmo ] we investigate how well @xmath0 is recovered in the ms using lrgs identified in the simulation . in  [ sec : model ] , we describe the modelling and age - dating of lrg spectra . in  [ sec : obs ] , we discuss an observational program to measure @xmath0 .",
    "we summarize our results and conclusions in  [ sec : conc ] . throughout this work ,",
    "we adopt the cosmology used in de lucia et al . ( 2006 ) of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "the millennium simulation is a dark - matter - only n - body simulation run using the gadget code of springel et al .",
    "the simulation has @xmath12 particles distributed in a 500@xmath13 mpc@xmath14 box .",
    "dark matter halos are identified in snapshots of the simulation at 63 different times and merger trees of halos are constructed .",
    "semi - analytical modelling of galaxy evolution is carried out using the merger trees , providing a catalogue of galaxies in each snapshot , where each galaxy has an array of observational properties associated with it ( baugh et al .",
    "2005 , bower et al .",
    "2006 , de lucia et al .",
    "properties of the halos and simulated galaxies are stored in a database which can be accessed from the web .    here , we focus on the galaxy catalogues constructed using the semi - analytical models of de lucia et al .",
    "we identify simulated galaxies with lrg properties in various snapshots ( corresponding to a particular set of redshifts near @xmath15 ) and then extract the star formation histories .",
    "the model does reproduce many properties of local galaxies and lrgs ( croton et al .",
    "2006 , de lucia et al .",
    "2006 ) , but a number of weakness are apparent as outlined in the introduction .",
    "in addition to the de lucia models , we examined the models by bower et al .",
    "( 2006 , hereafter durham models ) , which also uses the millennium simulation . however , the two models are different in the implementation of their semi - analytical models . for our purposes ,",
    "the most relevant difference between the models is in their handling of gas cooling , star formation , and feedback as these are directly related to the star formation histories of the galaxies .",
    "we save the comparison of other semi - analytical models and how they would affect the calculation of @xmath0 for future work .",
    "initially we extracted lrgs using the apparent magnitude constraints for sdss data from eisenstein et al .",
    "our target redshift is close to the redshift where the sdss ` cut i ' must be replaced with the ` cut ii ' colour selection criteria ( at @xmath16 , the balmer break moves into the r - band and a different colour selection is required to identify lrgs ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdss ] , we plot the average sfh for three redshift snapshots at @xmath17 .",
    "the sfhs , especially once normalized to the sfh at @xmath18 , show significant differences .",
    "importantly , there is no monotonic behaviour for successive @xmath19 . in table 1 , we summarize the average formation parameters for the population .",
    "there is a significant dispersion in formation redshift ( @xmath20 ) , the redshift of peak star formation ( @xmath21 ) , and the redshift of last major star formation epoch ( @xmath22 ) , which is defined as the redshift where the star formation rate falls below 10 @xmath23 . for galaxies in the ms at @xmath24 ,",
    "almost @xmath25 have had a burst of star formation greater than 5 @xmath26 in the previous gigayear and up to @xmath27 are greater than 3@xmath28 away from the average star formation history .",
    "in addition , the change in the average mass - weighted age , @xmath29 , does not correspond to the change in the age of the universe at these redshifts . between @xmath30 , the age of the simulated universe changes by 1.13 gyr , whereas the change in @xmath29 corresponds to 1.27 gyr . for @xmath31 ,",
    "the values are 0.26 and 0.18 gyr , respectively .",
    "a key assumption of this technique is that the galaxies are passively evolving .",
    "if true , then the change in their age with redshift should corresponding to the change in the age of the universe .",
    "however , that is not the case for this sample .",
    "the sample selected using the sdss cuts in the ms are not very homogeneous .",
    "a source of this inhomogeneity is the selection of galaxies in apparent magnitude space . due to the width of the redshift bin within which the apparent colour cuts are defined ,",
    "different types of galaxies are selected near the edges of the redshift bin including a large number of galaxies that have more extended sfhs .",
    "inclusion of these galaxies decreases the sensitivity of this method for determining @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the observing efficiency is reduced if only the oldest galaxies are used unless they can be pre - selected .    , the dotted line is for @xmath32 and the dashed line is for @xmath24 .",

    "< , < \" , ]          the large model library of different lrgs that we have created provide a mapping from spectra to mass - weighted ages .",
    "we can potentially use these spectra as our templates instead of the ssp templates . to test this , we extracted one spectrum from the models and then used the remaining models to age date that spectrum .",
    "then , we repeated this for all of the other spectra . for each spectrum , we used its mass weighted age as its fiducial age . testing the entire sample for 1448 @xmath24 model galaxies , we find a difference between the mass - weighted age and the measured age of @xmath33 gyr with a dispersion of @xmath34 gyrs .",
    "the result for the other redshifts are listed in table 2 .",
    "the systematic error , @xmath35 , and dispersion , @xmath36 , have been substantially reduced as compared to using ssps .",
    "in addition , these ages can be used to measure @xmath0 because they have very small , regular bias with respect to the age of the universe .",
    "in this section , we explore the minimum observing time required to recover @xmath0 to a precision of @xmath37 , and @xmath38 at @xmath39 .",
    "table 2 indicates that uncertainties on individual ages of galaxies could be as low as 0.3 gyr if suitable templates can be used .",
    "however , since it is still unclear what the uncertainty on individual ages of galaxies will be in a realistic experiment , we explore observing requirements for four values of this uncertainty ( 0.05 gyr , 0.5 gyr , 1 gyr and 2 gyr ) .",
    "we consider observations at two redshifts : @xmath18 and @xmath24 , giving a redshift interval of @xmath40 . to simplify our estimate , the mean ages at the two redshifts",
    "are calculated using the average age of lrgs at each redshift ( the first method discussed in  3 ) . according to equation ( [ eq : hzerr ] ) , the uncertainty on the mean ages will have to be @xmath41 gyr to measure @xmath0 with @xmath42 precision .    to estimate the uncertainty in mean age as a function of the number of galaxies and the uncertainty on individual ages , we do a simple monte carlo simulation .",
    "we assume the uncertainty on individual galaxy ages are normally distributed , and the galaxy ages are drawn from the probability distribution for galaxies at @xmath24 given by the fit to equation ( [ eq : pdf ] ) to the normalized age distribution .",
    "for each n , the simulation is repeated 1000 times and the standard deviation in the mean age is calculated .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ean ] and are used to calculate the total number of galaxies required to reach our desired precision .",
    "the other constraint on the total observing time is the exposure time per galaxy .",
    "we assume that we are only able to measure one galaxy at a time but note that multi - object spectroscopy could be used . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigage ] , the snr for different spectral resolutions was presented .",
    "even though the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigage ] are obtained using ssp fitting , we use them to provide a crude estimate of the resolution and signal to noise required to derive the random error on the ages of individual galaxies . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tott ] , we plot the total time needed as a function of signal to noise to calculate @xmath0 with different precision using the robert stobie spectrograph ( rss , kobulnicky et al .",
    "2003 ) on the southern african large telescope .",
    "we estimate that a 10% measurement is feasible using less than 20 hours of observing time but that a 3% measurement could require @xmath43 hours , even with our fairly optimistic estimates of @xmath44 .",
    "we note however , that the rss can be used in multi - object mode and , depending on the clustering , several lrgs may be expected in each field of view .",
    "using our cuts , we estimate the space density of lrgs to be @xmath45 from the sdss ( without considering the effects of incompleteness ) , which is comparable to the value of @xmath46 from the ms",
    ". if we are able to observe two additional lrgs per set - up with @xmath47 while calculating @xmath0 to @xmath48 as outlined above , it would give us a sufficient numbers of lrgs to calculate @xmath0 to @xmath38 at redshifts between @xmath47 .",
    "this would put a far tighter constraint on the value of @xmath0 than measuring it from two redshift bins alone .     as a function of the number of galaxies used for the measurement .",
    "we plot curves assuming four different uncertainties ( see legend ) in the measured age of an individual galaxy in the sample.,width=321 ]     at @xmath49 to @xmath50 and @xmath38 as a function of signal to noise of the observations .",
    "all observations are for @xmath51 and an overhead of 300 s per observation.,width=321 ]",
    "in this paper , we have shown that within the self - consistent universe of the millennium simulation that luminous red galaxies , when selected in an appropriate manner , can be used as cosmic chronometers . by selecting the galaxies from their rest - frame properties , we find that we can create a more homogeneous sample of objects than the apparent magnitude cuts used by eisenstein et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . for galaxies at @xmath52",
    ", we find that cuts of @xmath53 and @xmath54 select a sample of galaxies with similar star formation histories and formation redshifts in the ms .",
    "the galaxies selected in our final cut do show very similar star formation histories with very few of the galaxies showing any star formation since @xmath55 .",
    "the ages also show something akin to downsizing ( cowie et al .",
    "1996 ) : the oldest galaxies are in the most massive halos .",
    "the distribution of the ages are very similar with each showing a small tail towards younger age , but with the very strong peak at a single age .",
    "however we do note limitations in the use of the models of de lucia et al .",
    "they are able to reproduce some of the major trends seen in local galaxy populations and seem to have similar number density as the sdss out to @xmath56 . however , the model does have some limitations in reproducing some of the observed properties of lrgs while alternative models produce equally acceptable fits to the data .",
    "one such model explored here ( bower et al .",
    "2006 ) was unsatisfactory in matching the observed number density of lrgs defined by an absolute magnitude cut at a @xmath56 .",
    "even though these galaxies have extended sfhs , they can be used as cosmic chronometers to recover the cosmology used in the ms . using only galaxies selected from two redshifts ,",
    "@xmath0 can be calculated to a precision of less than @xmath48 using three different methods .",
    "all three methods ( averaging the ages , calculating a fit to the distribution , and comparing the ages of pairs of galaxies ) were able to recover the cosmology used in de lucia et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .    in  [ sec : model ]",
    ", we showed that ssps were not sufficient to accurately recover the ages for individual galaxies , which has also been shown for other samples ( maraston et al .",
    "2009 , trager & somerville 2009 ) . despite the relatively simple nature of the sfhs in fig .",
    "[ fig : civ ] , the calculated ssp ages were dominated by the most recent burst of star formation .",
    "if we use the average star formation history from the ms , we are able to replicate the properties of the model spectra , but in the next paper , we look in far greater detail at the modelling and fitting of lrg spectra .",
    "however , the semi - analytic models likely overestimate the extent of star formation in lrgs , and ssp models may provide better fits than indicated here .    finally , we estimated the required time to complete the project using rss on salt .",
    "if systematics in the age can be controlled , @xmath0 at @xmath57 can be calculated to @xmath48 in a total of @xmath43 hours , which includes observing overheads .",
    "it is likely that tighter constraints could be put on the evolution of @xmath0 with additional data that could be obtained while making these observations .",
    "in addition to constraining @xmath0 , it would contribute a wealth of detailed information about the evolution of the most massive galaxies at intermediate redshift .    throughout this work ,",
    "we have highlighted a number of assumptions that we have made .",
    "even with our refined selection , the star formation histories of these galaxies are not perfectly homogeneous as assumed by jimenez & loeb ( 2002 ) , but @xmath0 can still be calculated to an accuracy better than @xmath48 .",
    "other improvements on the measurement can be made by selecting a larger or more homogeneous sample as done by stern et al .",
    "uncertainties in the star formation history of simulated galaxies introduce far smaller errors than the contribution associated with age - dating the galaxies . in our next paper",
