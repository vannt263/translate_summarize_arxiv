    "ever since their introduction  @xcite , thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) equations have been an important tool in the study of both massive and massless integrable quantum field theories .",
    "although extensive studies have been carried out on scaling energies of vacuum or ground states only relatively few excited states  @xcite have proven amenable to tba analysis and these are primarily restricted to massive and diagonal scattering theories .",
    "so despite considerable successes , the application of tba methods has been hampered by inherent limitations .",
    "the primary obstacle is that to date there is no systematic and unified derivation of excited state tba equations .",
    "indeed , the current treatments of excited states are at best ad hoc and fall well short of a complete analysis of all excitations . here we address these limitations and propose a systematic approach based on the lattice .",
    "more specifically , we will show in a series of papers that both massive and massless excited tba equations can be systematically obtained by studying the continuum scaling limit of the associated integrable lattice models .",
    "perhaps the most important input from the lattice approach is an insight into the analytic structure of the excited state solutions of the tba equations .",
    "previously this structure had to be guessed .",
    "in stark contrast , in the lattice approach , the analyticity structure can be probed by direct numerical calculations on finite size transfer matrices .",
    "although the methods developed in this paper are very general , for simplicity and concreteness , we consider as a first example the massive tricritical ising model @xmath0 perturbed by the thermal operator @xmath1 .",
    "although this is a non - diagonal scattering theory and more complicated from the viewpoint of integrable quantum field theory , this is the simplest case beyond the ising model and lee - yang theory for analysis by the lattice approach .",
    "the integrable lattice model associated to the thermally perturbed tricritical ising model is the interacting hard square model or generalized hard hexagon model solved by baxter  @xcite .",
    "this model , with its @xmath6 sublattice symmetry , is known to be in the universality class of the tricritical ising model . more generally , this model is the special case @xmath7 of the @xmath8 lattice models of andrews , baxter and forrester  @xcite with the @xmath9 model being the usual ising model .",
    "generically these @xmath8 models , with their @xmath10 height reversal symmetry , are in the universality class of multicritical ising models . moreover , the continuum scaling limit of the @xmath8 models realize  @xcite the @xmath1 thermal perturbation of the @xmath11 unitary minimal models  @xcite and the ground states are described by the @xmath12 tba equations of zamolodchikov  @xcite .",
    "there have been many relevant studies of the tricritical hard square or @xmath3 lattice model and the more general @xmath8 models from the lattice viewpoint . for the @xmath3 model ,",
    "the off - critical tba functional equation for periodic boundary conditions has been derived and solved  @xcite for the bulk properties and correlation lengths .",
    "the off - critical tba functional equations for the @xmath8 models were derived by klmper and pearce  @xcite .",
    "but only the critical or ",
    "conformal tba \" equations were derived and solved in the critical scaling limit for the central charges and conformal weights .",
    "the very same off - critical tba functional equations for @xmath8 models were subsequently derived  @xcite in the presence of integrable boundaries showing that the tba functional equations are universal in the sense that they are independent of the boundary conditions .",
    "a biproduct of introducing boundaries is that the problem of classifying the excitations becomes much easier .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that at criticality the cylinder partition functions are given as linear forms in characters rather than the usual sesquilinear form on the torus .",
    "indeed , by a judicious choice of @xmath2 boundary conditions , the cylinder partition function is just a single virasoro character @xmath5 and the complete classification of excitations  @xcite in terms of @xmath4 systems  @xcite is related to a fermionic representation of the character @xmath5 .",
    "this simplification enabled  @xcite the complete analytic calculation of the conformal cylinder partition functions of the @xmath3 model with 6 different conformal boundary conditions @xmath2 which are conjugate to the 6 primary fields of the tricritical ising conformal field theory .",
    "the generalization of these results to the critical @xmath8 lattice models with @xmath2 boundaries is currently in progress  @xcite .    in 1998 , pearce and nienhuis  @xcite analysed the off - critical continuum scaling limit of the tba functional equations for the @xmath8 lattice models to derive from the lattice the full set of massive and massless @xmath12 ground state tba equations conjectured by zamolodchikov .",
    "the scale parameter @xmath13 is simply related to the scaling limit of lattice parameters by @xmath14 or more precisely @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the lattice spacing , @xmath17 is a mass , @xmath18 is the continuum length scale , @xmath19 is the correlation length exponent and @xmath20 is the deviation from critical temperature variable with @xmath21 the elliptic nome appearing in the boltzmann weights of the @xmath8 models .",
    "our primary goal in this series of papers is to extend the analysis of pearce and nienhuis to all excitations of the @xmath3 model both in the massive and massless regimes .",
    "this entails perturbing the analysis of obrien , pearce and warnaar  @xcite off criticality . to handle the problem of classification of all the excitations it is easier to introduce boundaries and to work on the cylinder even though a study of boundary properties is not our primary goal .",
    "our immediate goal is to study the flow of excitation energies from the uv ( @xmath22 ) to the ir ( @xmath23 ) limit . in the massive case",
    "we are thus able to compile the conformal - massive dictionary that eluded melzer  @xcite . in the massless case considered in paper",
    "ii  @xcite , we follow the renormalization group flow from the tricritical to the critical ising model fixed points .",
    "this leads to a flow between the characters of these theories .    in this paper",
    "we consider just the massive regime .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section  2",
    "we define the @xmath3 lattice model .",
    "we then describe the classification of excitations and discuss their unique labelling in terms of quantum numbers .",
    "this classification is in fact identical to the classification  @xcite at the tricritical point . in section  3",
    "we present the derivation of the off - critical massive tba equations .",
    "the numerical solution of these equations is presented in section  4 . throughout",
    "we concentrate on the three @xmath2 boundary conditions with @xmath24 rather than presenting exhaustive results for the six distinct @xmath2 boundary conditions .",
    "we believe these results are indicative of what can be achieved .",
    "while the calculations are similar for the other boundary conditions , we point out that in some cases there are further subtleties related to the appearance of frozen zeros .",
    "we conclude with a general discussion .",
    "the @xmath3 rsos lattice model is defined on a square lattice with spins or heights @xmath25 restricted so that nearest neighbour heights differ by @xmath26 .",
    "this model corresponds to the special case @xmath7 of the @xmath8 rsos models of andrews , baxter and forrester  @xcite with spins @xmath27 and boltzmann weights ( @xmath28 for the @xmath3 model ) @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the spectral parameter , @xmath31 is the crossing parameter and @xmath32 is one of the standard elliptic theta functions as given in gradshteyn and ryzhik  @xcite @xmath33 integrability derives from the fact that these local face weights satisfy the yang - baxter equation .",
    "the elliptic nome @xmath21 is a temperature - like variable .",
    "the @xmath8 lattice models are critical for @xmath34 and off - critical for @xmath35 so we introduce the deviation from critical temperature variable @xmath20 . there are four distinct off - critical physical regimes depending on the sign of @xmath30 and @xmath36 : @xmath37 it is convenient to express the nome @xmath38 in terms of a real parameter @xmath39 by @xmath40 so that @xmath41 and @xmath42 in particular , the elliptic @xmath43 functions satisfy the quasiperiodicity properties @xmath44 regimes iii and iv are of interest in this series of papers since they are associated , in the continuum scaling limit , with the massive and massless thermal perturbations of the unitary minimal models respectively . in regime",
    "iii , considered in this paper , @xmath21 is real whereas in regime  iv @xmath21 is pure imaginary .",
    "regimes i and ii relate to @xmath45 parafermions and so are not considered here .",
    "although we will not use it in this paper , an alternative formulation of the @xmath3 model is the particle or @xmath46 tadpole representation as shown in figure  1 .",
    "this formulation is obtained by folding the @xmath3 diagram and identifying the states related by the @xmath6 height reversal symmetry .",
    "more specifically , we can identify the states @xmath47 with @xmath48 and regard this as indicating the presence of a particle or an occupied site and we can identify the states @xmath49 with @xmath50 and regard this as indicating the absence of a particle or a vacant site .",
    "once we fix the sublattice of the square lattice which has odd heights , the identification of height and particle states is a one - to - one correspondence .",
    "the adjacency constraint on the heights of the @xmath3 model translates into the exclusion of simultaneous occupancy of adjacent sites by particles . in this way",
    "the particle representation is seen to be equivalent to a model of interacting hard squares on the square lattice .",
    "the boltzmann weights of this hard square model are simply given by replacing the heights @xmath25 by the corresponding particle occupation numbers @xmath51 .",
