    "collisional ring galaxies ( crgs ) consist of one or more sharply defined star - forming rings , generally ( but not always ) with a nucleus inside @xcite .",
    "theoretical models , both analytical ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and numerical ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , suggest that crgs are the result of nearly axisymmetric high - speed encounters between a disk galaxy ( the ` target ' or ` primary ' galaxy ) and an intruder galaxy . after the interaction , radially expanding density waves form because of the crowding of star orbits in the target disk .",
    "this causes gas compression and the triggering of a starburst episode along the expanding ring ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "crgs are unique laboratories for the study of galaxy collisions because of their simple interaction geometry . for example , the kinematics of the ring provides information about the dynamics of the interaction ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this information is used to constrain @xmath2-body / hydrodynamical models reproducing the formation process of well studied crgs such as the cartwheel galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and arp 147 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "numerical simulations are helpful tools to explore the parameter space of the collision and to disentangle the effect of each parameter on the evolution of crgs .",
    "@xcite study the properties of crgs formed in axisymmetric encounters with different intruder - to - target mass ratios .",
    "they show that , as the intruder mass increases , the ring becomes sharper , expands more rapidly and the secondary ring is less developed .",
    "@xcite explore the connection between gas fraction and star formation ( sf ) in simulations of empty crgs ( i.e. crgs without a central nucleus , such as arp 147 ) , and find that the gas fraction strongly influences the peak of sf rate ( sfr ) after the starburst .",
    "@xcite perform a large parameter study with the aim of reproducing the dynamical properties of the auriga s wheel @xcite , but they do not take into account the effects of the interaction parameters on the sf .    in this paper ,",
    "we investigate how the geometry of the impact affects the morphology and sf history of crgs .",
    "we employ a suite of adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) numerical simulations to study systematically the properties of crgs as a function of the interaction parameters that define the geometry of the encounter .",
    "this is the first time that the amr technique is applied to a wide grid of simulations studying the formation of crgs .",
    "our choice is particularly important , as the amr technique ensures a better treatment of hydrodynamical instabilities and shocks with respect to particle - based schemes ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ section2 ] we describe the main characteristics of our suite of simulations and briefly discuss the parameters of interest .",
    "in section [ section3 ] we present the results , and focus on the morphology and sf history of our models .",
    "we also extract synthetic photometric information about the colour of the ring and we compare it with observations . in section [ section4 ] we summarize our main findings .",
    "our simulations of galaxy interactions were performed with the public amr code ramses @xcite .",
    "ramses solves the fluid equations on an adaptive cartesian grid by means of a second - order godunov method coupled with a riemann solver .",
    "this method ensures a better treatment of hydrodynamical instabilities and shocks with respect to particle - based schemes ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "gravitational interactions are calculated using particle mesh ( pm ) techniques for @xmath2-body collisionless components ( stars and dark matter particles ) , solving the poisson equation on the amr grid with the multigrid strategy of @xcite .",
    "all the simulations presented in this paper adopt a cubic box of 960 kpc per edge , with a static coarse grid composed of @xmath3 cells .",
    "we used 7 additional levels of refinement to reach the maximum resolution of @xmath4 pc .",
    "grid refinement is triggered following three criteria , one for @xmath2-body particles , the other two for the gaseous component .",
    "the particle criterion requires that at least 24 particles reside in a cell before the refinement , so as to maintain a roughly constant number of particles per cell . the first criterion for gas",
    "is based on a ` quasi - lagrangian ' approach according to which refining is triggered if the gas mass inside a cell exceeds a threshold of @xmath5 .",
    "the second gas criterion is based on the jeans length ( @xcite ) : a cell at level @xmath6 is split if the local jeans length does not exceed 4 times the cell dimension @xmath7 . in the limit of our maximum resolution ,",
    "this choice allows us to properly follow the evolution of features such as dynamically unstable gaseous clumps in the expanding ring .",
    "gas dynamics is followed assuming a polytropic equation of state ( eos ) with adiabatic index @xmath8 , corresponding to a perfect mono - atomic gas .",
    "the interacting galaxies are embedded in a hot and thin medium with numerical density @xmath9 , and temperature @xmath10 .",
    "the ramses code includes physically - motivated sub - grid models for gas cooling , sf and supernova ( sn ) feedback .",
    "the code adopts the cooling function described in @xcite for temperatures down to @xmath11 .",
    "we include a sub - grid gaseous eos @xmath12 to model the behavior of the inter - stellar medium ( ism ) , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the sf density threshold ( see @xcite ) .",
    "sf is implemented in ramses following the prescriptions by @xcite .",
    "the conversion of gas density @xmath16 into star density @xmath17 is based on a schmidt - law @xcite of the form : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the sf efficiency , @xmath20 is the local dynamical time and @xmath15 is a density threshold .",
    "we chose @xmath21 and @xmath15 corresponding to a numerical density @xmath22 .",
    "such threshold density was selected to resolve the jeans length ( @xcite ) for a temperature @xmath23 k ( i.e. consistent with the minimum gas temperature in our simulations ) with our best spatial resolution ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "thus , the adopted threshold density is the highest that can be safely used with our spatial resolution and matches the one adopted in recent cosmological simulations that reproduce realistic milky way - like ( mw - like ) galaxies @xcite , and in simulations of the formation of off - centred crgs @xcite .",
    "most of cosmological simulations adopt a much lower density threshold ( @xmath24 , e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , that might unphysically enhance the sf ( see e.g. the discussion in @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "adopt @xmath25 ( a factor of 20 higher than our threshold ) in their cosmological simulations , but their spatial resolution is better than ours and their cooling function goes down to @xmath26 .",
    "our adopted value of the sf efficiency ( @xmath21 ) is a factor of @xmath27 higher than adopted in recent simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) , which follow the observational hints by @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we stress that ( i ) the @xmath19 parameter in our simulations is simply phenomenological and does not have a direct relation to the true sf efficiency within molecular clouds ( which we can not simulate realistically , see the discussion below ) , and that ( ii ) @xcite show that the simulated sf is much more affected by @xmath15 than by @xmath19 .    although the sf recipe used by @xcite is more elaborate than ours , we find similar results about the global sf history for qualitatively similar runs ( see the discussion below ) .",
    "star particles are then spawned following a stochastic approach @xcite , with a mass that is an integer multiple of @xmath28 .",
    "we stress that our best grid resolution ( 117 pc ) and our adopted cooling function @xcite are not suitable to follow the formation of low - temperature ( @xmath29 k ) high - density ( @xmath30 ) gas clouds , whose typical scale is expected to be @xmath31 pc and that were studied in previous simulations of multiphase interstellar medium ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . therefore , our simulations do not model sf in cold clumps , which is physically the main channel for sf . accounting for this would be computationally prohibitive to do for a wide set of galaxy interaction runs",
    "sn feedback is implemented as thermal feedback due to type ii sn explosions characterized by a specific energy @xmath32 @xcite . a total energy amount @xmath33 is deposited in the 27 cells around the star particle of mass @xmath34 during @xmath35 after the star particle creation .",
    "we assume a sn efficiency @xmath36 .",
    "we model the target galaxy as a mw - like disc galaxy composed of three @xmath2-body components and a gridded one : a dark matter ( dm ) halo , a stellar disc , a stellar bulge and a gaseous disc , respectively . for the dm halo",

    "we assume an axisymmetric exponential profile to model both the gaseous and stellar discs : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the total disc mass , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the radial and vertical scale length of both the gaseous and stellar discs , respectively .",
    "the gaseous disc has an initial constant temperature @xmath51 and we assume that it is composed of a mixture of ionized hydrogen and helium with a mean molecular weight @xmath52 .",
    "the density profile of the stellar bulge follows the spherical @xcite model : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the total mass and @xmath55 the radial scale length of the bulge .",
    "the intruder galaxy is a dwarf , spherical early - type galaxy composed of a nfw dm halo and a central stellar bulge devoid of any gaseous component .",
    "we chose not to simulate a gas - rich intruder because , in this paper , we are interested in studying the evolution of the gas of the target separately .    the parameters for the initial conditions ( ics ) of the two galaxies are shown in table [ table1 ] .",

    "the higher value @xmath61 represents a very fast interaction within a massive galaxy groups ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",

    "fig . [ figure_xy ] shows the face - on view of the simulated target galaxies at time @xmath64 after the interaction .",
    "images show the mass - weighted gas density maps .",
    "regardless of the interaction parameters , the ring - like features of the runs have a typical radius @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "this value slightly decreases for fast encounters , but the effect is small because the ring expansion velocity is mainly influenced by the mass of the perturber , in agreement with the results of @xcite .        simulations with @xmath56 show circular or nearly elliptical rings , depending on the value of the inclination angle .",
    "the gaseous component of the ring is quite broad ( with a width @xmath67 ) and clumpy , due to the combined effects of cooling , sf and sn feedback . inside the ring",
    "we observe radial gaseous spokes that are thicker and slightly less developed for the encounter with @xmath60 , and the presence of a gaseous and star - forming secondary ring that recently started propagating .",
    "observations of the cartwheel galaxy do not support our finding that spokes are mainly composed of gas : no hi or h@xmath68 emission is found in the spokes and in the inner ring ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , recent observations of ngc 922 @xcite show h@xmath68 emission and the presence of young star clusters along the incomplete ring as well as in the central bar and in correspondence to possible spokes .",
    "also the inner ring of arp 10 has h@xmath68 emission and seems to be a site of sf ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the amount of gas in the spokes and in the central regions of crgs may depend on the pre - encounter distribution of gas @xcite .",
    "off - centre collisions with @xmath69 and @xmath58 produce results similar to those reported by @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry of the interaction induces the displacement of the nucleus in the direction of the impact .",
    "the ring is also asymmetric and composed of two main structures originating from the displaced nucleus and connected at the end : a wide arc and a straighter arm .",
    "the wide arc is generally clumpy ( e.g. run a30b5v25 or a30b10v25 ) and resembles the gravitationally unstable tidal tail produced by galaxy interactions in @xcite . for simulations with @xmath58 , the ring is loosely connected for @xmath60 , and not connected in the case of @xmath61 .",
    "this trend is enhanced when the inclination angle @xmath63 is increased .",
    "our results suggest an approximate upper limit @xmath70 to produce a connected ring from an off - centre high - speed collision .",
    "another common feature of all the runs with @xmath71 is the development of a stellar and gaseous bar - like feature in correspondence to the displaced nucleus .",
    "[ figure_yz ] shows edge - on views of all the gaseous target discs at time @xmath64 after the interaction .",
    "images show the effects of the interaction on the vertical structure of the target disc . in all cases ,",
    "the target is displaced from its original position in the direction of the intruder by @xmath72 and @xmath73 for slower and faster interactions , respectively .",
    "another common feature is the development of thin gaseous tails in the direction of the intruder passage , especially for inclined interactions with @xmath74 .",
    "these tails can be sometimes observed as hi plumes departing from the target disc @xcite .",
    "off - centre and low - speed interactions produce more disc vertical heating than faster and symmetric encounters .",
    "moreover , the inclination angle induces a net torque on the target disc along the @xmath75 axis . therefore , after the interaction , the ring develops on a plane that is tilted with respect to the original plane of the disc . for the case with @xmath76 and @xmath77 , we can estimate the warp analytically .",
    "assuming that the intruder moves on a straight line in the @xmath78 plane with an inclination angle @xmath63 defined as above , only the @xmath75 component of the torque @xmath79 does not vanish on the entire target disc .",
    "it induces an angular momentum variation that can be estimated as ( see appendix [ appa ] for details ) : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the module of the intruder velocity , @xmath82 is the radial scale of the intruder ( for which we assume a plummer potential , see appendix [ appa ] ) , @xmath83 is the intruder baryonic mass and @xmath84 is the exponential surface density of the target disc .",
    "the unperturbed component of the angular momentum can be estimated as : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the circular velocity of the unperturbed exponential disc .",
    "then , we can parametrize the warping as : @xmath87 @xmath88 is the average warping of the target disc at each radial position , due to the gravitational torque exerted by the encounter .",
    "this simple treatment does not take into account the perturbation by the primary disc on the intruder motion and the propagation of the ring ) is acceptable , as the total mass of the intruder far exceeds the fluctuations induced in the stellar density of the target . ] .",
    "thus , it can only predict the overall inclination of the disc , represented by the nearly constant asymptotic value that @xmath88 assumes for radii @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) , as shown in the left - hand panel of fig . [ figure_warping ] .",

    "we assume the radial scale length of the intruder is @xmath93 ( see appendix [ appa ] ) . for run",

    "these values are in fair agreement with simulations ( as shown in the right - hand panel of fig . [ figure_warping ] ) and represent the overall inclination of the target disc with respect to the @xmath96 plane .    off - centre interactions with @xmath77 produce rings completely warped in the vertical direction , especially for slow encounters ( see fig .",
    "[ figure_yz ] ) . in these cases ,",
    "the loosely connected ring develops with a nearly helicoidal shape because of the coupled role played by the inclination angle , which induce the vertical torque discussed above , and by the asymmetric propagation of the expanding ring , due to @xmath97 @xcite .",

    "the target experiences an enhancement of sf when the intruder crosses the target disc .",

    "[ figure_sfra ] and [ figure_sfrv ] suggest that neither @xmath63 nor @xmath102 influence significantly the sf history of a typical crg .    by contrast , the impact parameter @xmath62 influences significantly the sf history in our simulations , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_sfrb ] .        we systematically observe a double - peaked sf history for axisymmetric encounters . after the interaction ,",
    "the sfr steeply increases , reaches a maximum and then decreases on a typical time scale @xmath103 .",
    "this is probably because the ring travels rapidly across the disc during the first @xmath104 after the interaction ; when it reaches the outskirts of the disc , the lower gas density quenches the sf . the first sf bump is followed by a second episode of sf due to the propagation of the secondary ring",
    ".    instead ,",
    "after the initial starburst , all off - centre encounters show a nearly constant or slowly rising sfr that lasts more than @xmath104 .",
    "the sf histories of runs with @xmath105 and @xmath106 represent a transition between truly axisymmetric and strongly off - centre interactions , as they still show a less pronounced double - peaked shape .",
    "these results are in agreement with @xcite .",
    "in particular , the sfr in their c and d models ( with @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively ) reaches @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively , during the first @xmath111 after the interaction .",
    "our run a0b10v65 is qualitatively comparable to theirs and we find similar values of @xmath112 despite the different implementation of the sf in the adopted codes .",
    "none of the considered interaction parameters appreciably affects the peak of sfr .",
    "this feature is more sensitive to other parameters such as @xmath113 , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "photometric properties can be inferred from our simulations , by using synthetic stellar population models .",
    "we use mass - to - light ratio tables based on the isochrones and synthetic stellar populations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these tables span the stellar age interval from @xmath114 to @xmath115 and give the magnitude in the @xmath116 bands for a stellar system with total mass @xmath117 and a chabrier initial mass function ( imf ; @xcite ) .",
    "we assume a constant sub - solar metallicity @xmath118 , in agreement with observations of crgs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ figure_b - v ] the synthetic @xmath0 colour maps obtained for all our simulations at time @xmath64 are shown .",
    "we calculated these maps after assigning a random age ( between @xmath119 and @xmath120 ) to stellar particles that were in the ics ; in this process we do not take into account any pre - interaction age / metallicity gradient . for purpose of visualization ,",
    "maps are smoothed with a gaussian filter with @xmath121 .",
    "all models show a blue ring - like feature with typical colour @xmath122 .",
    "the rings are sprinkled with bluer knots corresponding to regions of recent sf , with colour @xmath123 .",
    "the underlying disc is redder with an average colour @xmath124 .",
    "the ring is characterized by a blue colour bump with respect to the disc , @xmath125 , which is consistent with @xmath0 profiles derived by @xcite for a sample of 15 crgs .",
    "we repeated the same analysis assuming a metallicity @xmath126 , and we found similar results , even if with a redder ( @xmath127 ) overall colour .",
    "simulations with @xmath76 show a gaseous secondary ring that just started to expand ( see fig .",
    "[ figure_xy ] ) and that is expected to form stars , but colour maps do not show an excess of blue colour in the inner regions of the ring .",
    "this is in partial agreement with observations : for example , the cartwheel galaxy shows a red but gas - poor secondary ring ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in our models ,",
    "the secondary ring starts forming stars @xmath128 after , in correspondence to the second peak of the sfr at @xmath104 after the interaction .",
    "off - centre collisions show very blue knots mainly located in the wide arc and at the extremity of the bar - like nuclear region .",
    "this suggests that the asymmetry of the encounter can funnel gas to the nucleus and favor sf near it , as observed , for example , in ngc 922 @xcite .",
    "our simulations likely underestimate the clumpiness of the blue knots in the ring , as we can not resolve the giant molecular clouds and thus we can not produce realistic sf agglomerates , such as young dense star clusters ( see section [ subsec21 ] for a discussion about the limitations of the model ) .",
    "in this paper , we investigate the properties of crgs as a function of the interaction parameters by means of amr hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "we focus on three parameters : the impact parameter , the initial relative velocity and the inclination angle .",
    "all the simulations show a few common features , such as the radius of the ring ( @xmath65 ) at time @xmath64 after the interaction , which is weakly influenced by the three interaction parameters described above . on the other hand ,",
    "axisymmetric encounters produce crgs noticeably different with respect to those formed by off - centre interactions .",
    "axisymmetric interactions result in a circular primary ring followed by a smaller secondary ring , whereas crgs born from off - centre collisions show asymmetric rings and a displaced nucleus . in the most asymmetric cases ( @xmath129 and @xmath74 ) the ring",
    "is not connected .",
    "the maximum impact parameter to form a connected ring is @xmath70 , where @xmath49 is the scale length of the target disc .",
    "interactions with @xmath77 induce a torque on the target disc producing a vertical warp . in the special case of encounters with @xmath56 and @xmath77 , the ring develops on a plane tilted with respect to the original target disc plane and",
    "we propose a simple analytical treatment to predict the overall warping of the target disc after the interaction .    after the interaction ,",
    "the ring expansion enhances the sf in the target disc , reaching a typical sfr @xmath101 , in agreement with observations ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we show that the initial velocity and the inclination angle have weak effects on the peak of the starburst and on the evolution with time of the global sfr .",
    "instead , the impact parameter has a crucial effect on sf : symmetric encounters cause a short - lived starburst episode , whereas off - centre interactions produce long - lasting ( @xmath130 ) sf events .",
    "the expanding ring is the region mainly affected by sf , as suggested by observations ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this is confirmed by the synthetic colour maps ( based on the models by @xcite and @xcite ) that we compute from the simulations .",
    "we find an average @xmath0 colour @xmath131 for the ring , with clumps of massive sf with @xmath132 .",
    "the ring is typically @xmath133 bluer than the rest of the galaxy , in agreement with the @xmath0 colour profiles measured by @xcite for a sample of 15 crgs .",
    "a number of issues can not be explained by our simulations .",
    "for example , it is still unclear which mechanism regulates sf in the inner regions of the ring , since hi / h@xmath68 observations suggest that secondary rings are gas - poor ( e.g. , the cartwheel , @xcite ; @xcite ; but see also @xcite about arp 10 ) , while our simulations predict the opposite .",
    "this may be due to several reasons , such as the initial distribution of gas inside the disc , or the idealized sub - grid sf process that does not take into account the chemical abundances and the role of @xmath134 .",
    "thus , future works will require more realistic initial gas distributions and/or more detailed recipes of sf ( e.g. @xmath134 regulated sf , @xcite ; @xcite ) to better constrain the sf in crgs .",
    "another interesting issue we did not explore ( but plan to investigate in the future ) is the effect of a gas - rich intruder . in this respect ,",
    "we remind that the sph simulations of @xcite suggest that the main differences between encounters with ( disc - like ) gas - rich and gas - poor intruders are related to the sf history , whereas the effects on the ring morphology are quite limited , even if some features ( such as plumes ) appear to be more developed in the gas - rich case .",

    "we model the intruder galaxy as a plummer sphere with potential : @xmath135 where @xmath82 is the scale radius of the potential and @xmath83 is the intruder baryonic mass .",

    "the target disc initially lies on the @xmath96 plane and has a surface density profile @xmath137 .",
    "the force exerted on an infinitesimal mass portion @xmath138 located at @xmath139 of the target disc is : @xmath140 we can now derive the torque exerted on the same mass element : @xmath141 where : @xmath142 integrating eq .",

( [ eq : n_a ] ) to obtain the variation of @xmath151 due to the torque exerted by the intruder , @xmath153 , with the condition @xmath154 ( i.e. we assume that for @xmath155 @xmath156 and the torque is zero ) .",

    "this treatment of the torque induced by the intruder galaxy on the target disc is very approximated , as it does not take into account the gravitational effects of the target galaxy on the motion of the intruder and the propagation of the ring as a consequence of the interaction .",
    "moreover , the intruder is modeled as a plummer sphere for the sake of simplicity .",
    "however , we choose the radial scale @xmath82 such that the mass enclosed inside @xmath82 by the plummer profile is the same as enclosed by the hernquist profile : @xmath170 where @xmath55 is the scale radius of the hernquist profile . despite the approximations",
