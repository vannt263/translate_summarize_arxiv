    "in the last few decades dusty plasma attracts the researchers most , not only because of different types of wave propagation in dusty plasma due to their involvement in the study of astrophysical and space environments but also for its great variety of new phenomena associated with waves and instabilities.@xcite dusty plasmas essentially consists of fairly massive , charged particulates in addition to electrons and ions in the usual two component plasma .",
    "acoustic wave modes in dusty plasma have received a great deal of attention since the last decade .",
    "depending on different time scales , there can exists two or more acoustic waves in a typical dusty plasma .",
    "dust acoustic ( da ) and dust ion - acoustic ( dia ) waves are two such acoustic waves in a plasma containing electrons , ions , and charged dust grains .",
    "shukla and silin @xcite were the first to show that due to the quasi neutrality condition @xmath11 and the strong inequality @xmath12 ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are , respectively , the number density of electrons , ions , and dust particle , where @xmath16 is the number of electrons residing on the dust grain surface ) , a dusty plasma ( with negatively charged static dust grains ) supports low - frequency dia waves with phase velocity much smaller ( larger ) than electron ( ion ) thermal velocity . in case of long wavelength limit",
    "the dispersion relation of dia wave is similar to that of ia wave for a plasma with @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the average ion ( electron ) temperature . due to the usual dusty plasma approximations ( @xmath12 and @xmath20 ) , a dusty plasma can not support the usual ion - acoustic ( ia ) waves , but the dia waves of shukla and silin @xcite can .",
    "thus dia waves are basically ia waves , modified by the presence of heavy dust particulates .",
    "the theoretical prediction of shukla and silin @xcite was supported by a number of laboratory experiments.@xcite the linear properties of dia waves in dusty plasma are now well understood .",
    "@xcite    due to a balance between the wave dispersion and nonlinearity , there exists the possibility of dia solitary waves ( diasws ) in a dusty plasma .",
    "the diasws studied using the reductive perturbation technique which gives korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation or korteweg - de vries burgers ( kdvb ) equation as nonlinear evolution equations.@xcite bharuthram and shukla @xcite studied the nonlinear waves associated with dia waves .",
    "mamun and shukla @xcite have investigated the condition for existence of positive and negative potential diasws , and examined how the ion - fluid temperature modifies the amplitude of diasws . in presence of negatively charged dust grains , one can have diasws with negative potentials , when the electron number density is less than one third of the positive ion number density @xcite .",
    "et al _ @xcite have shown that in the dust - modified ion acoustic regime , negative structures can also be generated , beside positive potential soliton for electrons with a polytropic index @xmath21 , as well as for boltzmann electrons .",
    "the effect of ion - fluid temperature on diasws structures have been investigated by sayed and mamun @xcite in a dusty plasma containing adiabatic ion - fluid , boltzmann electrons , and static dust particles . in the above mentioned works the nonlinear properties of diasws investigated for @xmath22 .    in most of the earlier works ,",
    "maxwellian velocity distribution function for lighter species of particles has been used to study diasws and dia double layers ( diadls ) . however the dusty plasma with nonthermally / suprathermally distributed electrons observed in a number of heliospheric environments @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is of considerable importance to study nonlinear wave structures in a dusty plasma in which lighter species ( electrons ) are nonthermally / suprathermally distributed .",
    "recently baluku _ et al _ @xcite investigated diasws in an unmagnetized dusty plasma consisting of cold dust particles and kappa distributed electrons using both small and arbitrary amplitude techniques .",
    "in the present investigation we have considered the problem of existence as well as the polarity of diasws and diadls in a nonthermal dusty plasma consisting of negatively charged dust grains , adiabatic positive ions and nonthermal electrons at the smallest possible value of the mach number @xmath2 .",
    "the sagdeev potential approach@xcite has been considered to investigate the existence of solitary wave and double layer at @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the lower bound of the mach number @xmath2 , i.e. , solitary wave and/or double layer solutions of the energy integral start to exist for @xmath22 . in",
    "most of the earlier works , solitary wave and/or double layer solutions have been investigated for @xmath22 .",
    "however , some recent investigations @xcite have shown that finite amplitude solitary wave can exist at @xmath23 in the parameter regime where solitons of both polarities exist .",
    "the numerical observations @xcite of the solitary wave solution of the energy integral at @xmath23 , motivate us to investigate the existence of diasw and diadl .",
    "however , we have approach in a different way without considering the parameter regime of the system for @xmath22",
    ". three basic parameters of the present dusty plasma system are @xmath8 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which are respectively the ratio of unperturbed number density of nonthermal electrons to that of ions , the ratio of average temperature of ions to that of nonthermal electrons , a parameter associated with the nonthermal distribution of electrons .",
    "nonthermal distribution of electrons becomes isothermal one if @xmath27 and consequently , for isothermal electron species , the present dusty plasma contains only two basic parameters @xmath8 and @xmath25 .",
    "it has been found that solitary wave or double layer do not exist for @xmath28 . for isothermal distributed electrons ,",
    "ppsws exist for @xmath29 , whereas for all @xmath8 lies within @xmath30 , there exist npsws . at @xmath31 , no solitary wave or",
    "double layer solution is possible .",
    "however , there do not exists any double layer solution for isothermal electrons . for nonthermal distributed electrons ,",
    "we have found two critical values of @xmath3 , viz .",
    ", @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the upper bounds of @xmath3 for the existence of ppsws and npsws , respectively . however , the coexistence of both npsws and ppsws are not possible in the present system . again , at @xmath34 , no solitary wave or double layer solution is possible .",
    "we have also found the existence of negative potential double layer ( npdl ) in a portion of the solution space .",
    "depending on the nature of solutions of dia waves , we have @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 such that the entire parametric space can be delimited into three subintervals of @xmath8 , viz . , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "for each @xmath8 in @xmath40 , there exists a value @xmath10 of @xmath3 , such that one can found the existence of npdl .",
    "there is an interesting phenomena occur around the point @xmath41 .",
    "there exists a finite jump in amplitude of npsws at @xmath41 , the jump being the amplitude of the double layer exists at @xmath41 .",
    "the amplitude of npsw decreases with increasing @xmath3 and ultimately , demolished at @xmath34 . on the other hand",
    ", ppsw creates from @xmath34 and the amplitude of ppsw increases with @xmath3 , having maximum amplitude at @xmath42 . throughout the investigation we have considered @xmath43 as the upper bound of @xmath8 , which is strictly less than 1 , since for @xmath44 , the effect of charged dust on",
    "dia wave is negligible .",

    "the governing equations describing the nonlinear behavior of dia waves , propagating along @xmath45-axis , in collisionless , unmagnetized dusty plasma consisting of negatively charged immobile dust grains , adiabatic positive ions and nonthermal electrons are the following : @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 where the parameter @xmath50 .    here",
    "we have used the notation @xmath51 or @xmath52 for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath45 and @xmath59 are , respectively , the ion number density , electron number density , ion velocity , ion pressure , electrostatic potential , spatial variable and time , and they have been normalized by @xmath14 ( unperturbed ion number density ) , @xmath13 ( unperturbed electron number density ) , @xmath60(@xmath61 ) ( ion - acoustic speed ) , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64(debye length ) , and @xmath65 ( ion plasma period ) . here",
    "@xmath66 is the adiabatic index , @xmath67 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are , respectively , the average temperatures of ions and electrons , @xmath70 is the mass of an ion , @xmath15 is the dust number density , @xmath16 is the number of negative unit charges residing on dust grain surface , and @xmath71 is the charge of an electron .",
    "the above equations are supplemented by nonthermally distributed electrons as prescribed by cairns _",
    "@xcite for the electron species .",
    "actually , in a number of heliospheric environments , dusty plasma contains nonthermally distributed ions or electrons .",
    "therefore , it is of considerable importance to study diasws and diadls in dusty plasma in which electrons are nonthermally distributed .",
    "nonthermal distribution of any lighter species of particles ( as prescribed by cairns _",
    "@xcite for the electron species ) can be regarded as population of boltzmann distributed particles together with a population of energetic particles .",
    "this can also be regarded as a modified boltzmannian distribution , which has the property that the number of particles in phase space in the neighbourhood of the point @xmath72 is much smaller than the number of particles in phase space in the neighbourhood of the point @xmath72 for the case of boltzmann distribution , where @xmath73 is the velocity of the particle in phase space .",
    "this type of velocity distribution is often termed as cairns distribution and was considered by many authors in various studies of different collective processes in plasmas and dusty plasmas @xcite . under the above mentioned normalization of the dependent and independent variables , the normalized number density of nonthermal cairns",
    "distributed electrons can be written as @xmath74 where @xmath75 with @xmath76 . here",
    "@xmath3 and consequently @xmath77 are the parameters associated with nonthermal distribution of electrons . from ( [ beta1 ] ) and inequality @xmath76",
    ", it can be easily checked that the nonthermal parameter @xmath3 is restricted by the following inequality : @xmath78 .",
    "however we can not take the whole region of @xmath3 ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "plotting the nonthermal velocity distribution of electrons against phase velocity ( @xmath73 ) of electrons in phase space , it can be easily shown that the number of electrons in phase space in the neighbourhood of the point @xmath72 decreases with increasing @xmath3 and the number of electrons in phase space in the neighbourhood of the point @xmath72 is almost zero when @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , for increasing values of @xmath3 distribution function develops wings , which become stronger as @xmath3 increases , and at the same time the center density in phase space drops , the latter as a result of the normalization of the area under the integral .",
    "so , we should not take values of @xmath81 since that stage might stretch the credibility of the cairns model too far @xcite . so here",
    "we consider the effective range of @xmath3 as follows : @xmath82 , where @xmath83 .",
    "when @xmath27 , nonthermal distribution of electrons becomes isothermal one .    now introducing a new parameter @xmath84 , the charge neutrality condition",
    ", @xmath85 can be written as @xmath86 so that the poisson equation ( [ poisson eq without mu ] ) can be written as @xmath87 we note from ( [ charge neutrality with mu ] ) that @xmath88 must be greater than zero , i.e. , @xmath89 .",
    "when @xmath44 , the effect of negatively charged dust grains on dia wave is negligible and so , we restrict @xmath8 by the inequality @xmath90 , where @xmath43 is strictly less than 1 .",
    "to study the arbitrary amplitude time independent dia solitary structures we make all the dependent variables depend only on a single variable @xmath91 , where the mach number @xmath2 is normalized by @xmath60 .",
    "thus in the steady state , ( [ continuity of ions])-([pressure eq ] ) and ( [ poisson eq ] ) can be written as @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 using the boundary conditions , @xmath96 and solving ( [ continuity of ions steady state ] ) - ( [ pressure eq steady state ] ) , we get a quadratic equation for @xmath97 and the solution of this quadratic equation can be put in the following form : @xmath98 where @xmath99 from the expression of @xmath97 as given by ( [ n_i with phi_m psi_m ] ) we see that @xmath97 is nonnegative if and only if @xmath100 and @xmath101 both are real . again",
    "@xmath100 and @xmath101 both are real if and only if @xmath102 and @xmath103 both are real and nonnegative . but @xmath102 and @xmath103 both are real and nonnegative if and only if @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively , and finally the conditions @xmath104 and @xmath105 hold simultaneously if and only if @xmath106 . now from ( [ psi_m phi_m ] ) we see that @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) and consequently ( [ n_i with phi_m psi_m ] ) gives theoretically valid expression of @xmath97 if and only if @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , for the present problem we are restricted by the inequality : @xmath110 .",
    "but numerically it is not possible to get the correct value of @xmath54 from ( [ n_i with phi_m psi_m ] ) for small value of @xmath25 because the denominator of the right hand side of ( [ n_i with phi_m psi_m ] ) is @xmath111 . to remove @xmath25 from the denominator of the right hand side of ( [ n_i with phi_m psi_m ] ) we first of all note that @xmath112 for all @xmath109 and consequently we can multiply the numerator and the denominator of the right hand side of ( [ n_i with phi_m psi_m ] ) by @xmath113 and we get the following expression of @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath114 from ( [ n_i with phi_m psi_m 2 ] ) , we see that this equation gives both theoretically and also numerically correct expression of @xmath54 even when @xmath115 if @xmath109 .",
    "now if we put @xmath116 in ( [ n_i with phi_m psi_m 2 ] ) , we get the same expression of @xmath54 for the cold dust fluid with @xmath117 .    now integrating ( [ poisson eq steady state ] ) with respect to @xmath58 and using the boundary conditions ( [ boundary cond ] ) , we get the following equation known as energy integral with @xmath118 as sagdeev potential or pseudo - potential .",
    "@xmath119 where @xmath120 @xmath121 @xmath122 although @xmath123 is a function of @xmath58 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath8 and @xmath25 , but for simplicity , we can omit any argument from @xmath124 when no particular emphasis is put upon it .",
    "for example , when we write @xmath125 , it is meant that the arguments @xmath3 , @xmath8 and @xmath25 assume fixed values in their physically admissible range and for the fixed values of @xmath3 , @xmath8 and @xmath25 , nature of solitary structures as obtained from the energy integral ( [ energy int ] ) depends only on @xmath2 .",
    "the energy integral ( [ energy int ] ) can be regarded as the one - dimensional motion of a particle of unit mass whose position is @xmath58 at time @xmath126 with velocity @xmath127 in a potential well @xmath123 .",
    "the first term of the energy integral can be regarded as the kinetic energy of a particle of unit mass at position @xmath58 and time @xmath126 whereas @xmath123 is the potential energy of the same particle at that instant . since kinetic energy is always a non - negative quantity , @xmath128 for the entire motion , i.e. , zero is the maximum value for @xmath123 . again from ( [ energy int ] ) , we find @xmath129 , i.e. the force acting on the particle at the position @xmath58 is @xmath130 .",
    "suppose , @xmath131 , therefore , the particle is in equilibrium at @xmath132 because the velocity as well as the force acting on the particle at @xmath132 are simultaneously equal to zero .",
    "now if @xmath133 can be made an unstable position of equilibrium , the energy integral can be interpreted as the motion of an oscillatory particle if @xmath134 for some @xmath135 , i.e. , if the particle is slightly displaced from its unstable position of equilibrium then it moves away from its unstable position of equilibrium and it continues its motion until its velocity is equal to zero , i.e. , until @xmath58 takes the value @xmath136 .",
    "now the force acting on the particle of unit mass at position @xmath137 is @xmath138 .",
    "for @xmath139 , the force acting on the particle at the point @xmath140 is directed towards the point @xmath132 if @xmath141 , i.e. , if @xmath142 . on the other hand , for @xmath143",
    ", the force acting on the particle at the point @xmath140 is directed towards the point @xmath132 if @xmath144 , i.e. , if @xmath145 . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath145 ( for the positive potential side ) or if @xmath142 ( for the negative potential side ) then the particle reflects back again to @xmath133 . again , if @xmath146 then the velocity @xmath147 as well as the force @xmath148 both are simultaneously equal to zero at @xmath137 .",
    "consequently , if the particle is slightly displaced from its unstable position of equilibrium ( @xmath133 ) it moves away from @xmath133 and it continues its motion until the velocity is equal to zero , i.e. , until @xmath58 takes the value @xmath137 .",
    "however it can not be reflected back again at @xmath133 as the velocity and the force acting on the particle at @xmath137 vanish simultaneously . actually , if @xmath145 ( for @xmath143 ) or if @xmath142 ( for @xmath139 ) the particle takes an infinite long time to move away from the unstable position of equilibrium .",
    "after that it continues its motion until @xmath58 takes the value @xmath136 and again it takes an infinite long time to come back its unstable position of equilibrium .",
    "therefore , for the existence of a ppsw ( npsw ) solution of the energy integral ( [ energy int ] ) , we must have the following : ( a ) @xmath132 is the position of unstable equilibrium of the particle , ( b ) @xmath134 , @xmath149 @xmath150 for some @xmath151 @xmath152 , which is nothing but the condition for oscillation of the particle within the interval @xmath153 and ( c ) @xmath154 for all @xmath155 @xmath156 ) , which is the condition to define the energy integral ( [ energy int ] ) within the interval @xmath153 . for the existence of a ppdl ( npdl ) solution of the energy integral ( [ energy int ] ) , the conditions ( a ) and ( c ) remain unchanged but here ( b )",
    "has been modified in such a way that the particle can not be reflected again at @xmath133 , i.e. , the condition ( b ) assumes the following form : @xmath157 , @xmath158 for some @xmath151 @xmath159 ) .",
    "the above discussions for the existence of solitary waves and double layers are valid if @xmath133 is an unstable position of equilibrium , i.e. , if @xmath160 along with @xmath131 . in other words ,",
    "@xmath132 can be made an unstable position of equilibrium if the potential energy of the said particle attains its maximum value at @xmath132 .",
    "now , the condition @xmath161 gives a lower bound @xmath24 of @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , and @xmath164 .",
    "this @xmath24 is , in general , a function of the parameters involved in the system , or a constant .",
    "therefore , if @xmath165 , the potential energy of the said particle attains its minimum value at @xmath132 , and consequently , @xmath132 is the position of stable equilibrium of the particle , and in this case , it is impossible to make any oscillation of the particle even when it is slightly displaced from its position of stable equilibrium , and consequently there is no question of existence of solitary waves or double layers for @xmath165 . in other words , for the position of unstable equilibrium of the particle at @xmath132 , i.e. , for @xmath166 , the function @xmath123 must be convex within a neighborhood of @xmath132 and in this case both type of solitary waves ( negative or positive potential ) may exist if other conditions are fulfilled .",
    "now suppose that @xmath167 and also @xmath168 , then if @xmath169 , the potential energy of the said particle attains its maximum value at @xmath132 and consequently , @xmath132 is the position of unstable equilibrium . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath167 , @xmath168 , and @xmath170 , the potential energy of the said particle attains its minimum value at @xmath132 and consequently , @xmath132 is the position of stable equilibrium of the particle and in this case there is no question of existence of solitary wave solution and/or double layer solution of the energy integral ( [ energy int ] ) .",
    "however if @xmath171 and @xmath172 , then with the help of simple mathematics , it can be shown that @xmath173 is a concave function in @xmath174 and @xmath173 is a convex function in @xmath175 , where @xmath176 is strictly positive quantity but can be made sufficiently small . _ the out line of proof of this result is given in appendix .",
