    "this process is ultimately limited by the lifetime of the bright exciton , which can be as short as 2  ns .",

    "the experimentally measured dcp under cw excitation @xmath41 as used in fig .",
    "[ fig : pl](d ) coincides with the equilibrium spin polarization @xmath11 .",
    "before we turn to the theoretical model , let us briefly summarize the experimental results .",
    "we have shown that in cdte ncs the magnetic - field - induced circular polarization the of pl reaches a saturation level of about @xmath42 at @xmath4  k. the spin relaxation time of the dark excitons is considerably shorter than its lifetime ( @xmath40 ) , so that the polarization under cw excitation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pl](d ) corresponds to the thermal equilibrium population of the exciton zeeman levels .",
    "the strong dependence of the recombination dynamics on magnetic field evidences that most of the ncs have a quantization axis due to geometry deviation from the spherical shape .",
    "one of the experimental results that we need to explain is the rather low saturation level of @xmath43 in the limit of high magnetic fields .",
    "depending on the nc spin structure that is determined , e.g. , by the nc nonspherical shape , different levels of dcp saturation are expected :    \\(i ) in prolate cdte ncs , the exciton fine structure is similar to that of spherical or oblate hexagonal cdse ncs .",
    "the lowest exciton state is the dark exciton with spin projections on the quantization axis @xmath20 , while the states @xmath44 ( here the bright exciton due to the anisotropy induced admixture of the @xmath45 state ) and @xmath46 are shifted to higher energies  @xcite .",
    "if the condition @xmath40 is fulfilled , then the dcp of the dark exciton is determined only by its zeeman splitting and the temperature . the dcp saturation level in high magnetic fields",
    "should be @xmath47 and may become reduced to @xmath48 in case of strong nonradiative recombination @xcite , here the sign of dcp depends on the exciton @xmath1-factor . in the other limiting case @xmath49 or in the intermediate cases the value of time - integrated dcp will be reduced by the dynamical factor of the dark exciton @xmath50 .",
    "however , the relaxation from bright to dark exciton might transfer the exciton polarization gained during the relaxation of the bright exciton to the polarization of the dark exciton and thus contribute to the observed dcp .",
    "this situation has not been considered theoretically up to now .",
    "\\(ii ) in oblate cdte ncs the dark exciton ground state has spin @xmath46 @xcite and , therefore , does not split in external magnetic field . as long as this state is the lowest one , i.e. it is not crossed by the next lying bright exciton state with @xmath51 that becomes split with increasing magnetic field , the dcp value is zero .    in the following ,",
    "we first revisit the case of prolate ncs and show that even when accounting for the four level system with a transfer of spin polarization from bright to dark excitons the saturation dcp level does not significantly reduce .",
    "therefore , none of the considered scenarios can explain our experimental data .",
    "the small saturation level of @xmath52 can , however , be explained by a model suggesting that the nc ensemble consists of a mixture of prolate and oblate ncs . in nonspherical prolate cdte ncs",
    ", the total angular momentum of the hole is aligned along the quantization axis originating from the shape anisotropy . due to the exchange interaction between electron and hole ,",
    "the electron spin becomes also pinned along this quantization axis . as a result",
    "the exciton @xmath1-factors for both dark and bright excitons are anisotropic and the exciton zeeman splittings depend on the angle between the quantization axis and the magnetic field direction .",
    "since the quantization axis is randomly oriented , the dcp of an ensemble of ncs has to be integrated over all angles .",
    "the recombination time of the dark exciton , being controlled by the dark - bright mixing of the exciton states , also depends on the magnetic field strength and on the nc orientation relative to the field direction .",
    "this may change the relative contribution of differently oriented ncs to the integral pl intensity and to the dcp signal in case of significant nonradiative recombination .",
    "the way to account for such contribution has been suggested in ref .",
    "we extend this approach for the case of a four level exciton structure with spin - dependent relaxation from bright to dark exciton .",
    "details of the four level model are given in the appendix .",
    "the time - integrated dcp of an ensemble of randomly oriented , prolate cdte ncs can be described by @xmath53 where @xmath54 here @xmath55 is the dynamical factor of the bright exciton , @xmath56^{-1}$ ] is the quantum efficiency of the prolate cdte ncs  @xcite , ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the radiative and nonradiative decay times of the dark exciton in prolate dots ) .",
    "@xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the angle between the nc quantization axis and the magnetic field direction .",
    "we have introduced two equilibrium polarizations of bright and dark exciton populations @xmath61 , controlled by the bright , @xmath62 , and dark , @xmath63 , exciton @xmath1-factors .",
    "( [ rho_int ] ) is derived for the case of equal initial population of bright and dark exciton states and the extreme case of spin dependent relaxation between bright and dark excitons ( see appendix ) .",
    "( [ rho_int ] ) has been obtained for the case @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the zero field splitting between the bright and dark excitons ( a more general consideration will be presented elsewhere ) .",
    "note , that if the bright and dark exciton @xmath1-factors have different signs the contributions from the bright and dark exciton polarizations may partly compensate each other .",
    "however , as we have already established the relatively fast spin relaxation for the dark exciton in experiment , its dynamical factor @xmath66 and , therefore , no contribution from the bright exciton to the dcp is expected .    thus to explain the experimentally observed low saturation level of dcp at high magnetic fields we suggest that there is a subset of oblate ncs in the nc ensemble .",
    "it is important to note , that for such ncs the nonzero recombination rate of the dark @xmath46 exciton state in zero magnetic field is due to the admixture of bright exciton states , either @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
    "the rate can be accelerated by a magnetic field component perpendicular to the anisotropy axis due to the field - induced admixture of the @xmath69 states @xcite .",
    "( we assume that the zeeman energy is much smaller than the energy separation to the upper bright exciton states . )",
    "thus no strong difference between the magnetic field dependences of the recombination dynamics is expected for prolate and oblate ncs and the presence of both kinds of ncs leads to additional independent contributions to the multi - exponent emission decay only .    since the exciton ground state of oblate cdte ncs",
    "does not split in magnetic field , such ncs contribute only to the total pl intensity and give no dcp signal .",
    "then , the time - integrated dcp @xmath18 of an ensemble consisting of cdte ncs with oblate and prolate shapes can be written as : @xmath70 dx } } , \\label{eq : mix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the ratio of the number of oblate to prolate ncs , and @xmath72^{-1}$ ] is the quantum efficiency of oblate ncs ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the radiative and nonradiative decay times of the dark exciton in oblate ncs ) .",
    "next , we discuss two extreme cases and use them for fitting the experimental data in fig .",
    "[ fig : pl](d ) .",
    "first , in the limit of high quantum yield for both prolate and oblate ncs we put @xmath75 . then , eq .   reduces to @xmath76 the time - integrated dcp measured at the three explored temperatures can be fitted well using eq .",
    "( see red lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : pl](d ) ) with two fitting parameters : @xmath77 and @xmath24 .",
    "it is worth to note that not only the absolute value but also the sign of the exciton @xmath1-factor can be obtained from our experiment , as it is closely connected to the dcp sign .",
    "second , in the limit of low quantum yield ( @xmath78 ) at zero magnetic field , one can assume the quantum efficiency of prolate ( oblate ) dots gained in magnetic field to be @xmath79  @xcite .",
    "then , eq .   reduces to @xmath80 fitting the experimental data in fig .",
    "[ fig : pl](d ) with eq .",
    "gives @xmath81 , which is close to the first limiting case of 2.4 and @xmath82 .    by comparing these two extreme cases ,",
    "we conclude that the dark exciton @xmath1-factor in 3.4  nm - diameter cdte ncs is in the range from 2.4 to 2.9 .",
    "its positive sign corresponds to the observed negative circular polarization induced by the magnetic field .",
    "the obtained value is in good agreement with theoretical estimations of the dark exciton @xmath1-factor of 3.7 according to @xmath83 @xcite , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the electron and hole @xmath1-factors . in bulk",
    "cdte @xmath86 , however , due to the strong quantum confinement in 3.4  nm ncs it becomes positive and we estimate its value using the theory developed in ref .",
    "@xcite to be @xmath87 .",

    "@xcite ) as @xmath88 .",
    "all material parameters used for the calculations were taken from ref .",
    "the fact that we obtain from our fitting a value of the exciton @xmath1-factor , that is expected for the dark exciton , approves our assignment of the slow component in the dcp dynamics to the dark exciton .",

    "note , that in cdse / cds ncs with shells thicker than 5  nm the emission is dominated by negatively charged excitons ( trions ) having rather long spin relaxation times up to 60  ns , measured at @xmath90  t and @xmath4  k @xcite .    in small neutral colloidal ncs",
    ", the exciton spin relaxation between the @xmath51 states is mainly driven by the long - range electron - hole exchange interaction and by the exciton - phonon interaction @xcite .",
    "for the dark exciton the relaxation between the @xmath20 sublevels may be caused by the same mechanisms considering the admixture of the @xmath51 states .",
    "this explains the longer spin relaxation within the dark exciton doublet compared to the bright excitons and its acceleration in magnetic field .    to summarize ,",
    "the exciton recombination and spin relaxation dynamics have been studied experimentally for colloidal cdte ncs at cryogenic temperatures and in high magnetic fields .",
    "the strong modification of the recombination dynamics in magnetic field evidences that the studied ncs have a structural quantization axis being either prolate or oblate in shape .",

    "these rates are related to the exciton lifetimes by @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "we consider only the extreme cases of spin dependent relaxation in which only the process between the @xmath104 and @xmath105 states ( or the @xmath106 and @xmath107 states ) are possible , both at zero temperature and thermally induced at elevated temperature .",
    "for these processes only the flip of the electron spin is required , which can be provided via interaction with acoustic phonons ( in one - phonon processes ) or via interaction with surface localized spins .",
    "the cross - relaxation processes between the @xmath104 and @xmath108 states ( or the @xmath106 and @xmath105 states ) require the flip of the heavy - hole spin 3/2 and , therefore , are considerably slower @xcite .",

    "this allows us to neglect the thermally - induced mixing between bright and dark exciton states and put @xmath112 , while thermalization between the zeeman levels of the bright ( dark ) excitons is taken into account .",
    "a more general consideration will be published elsewhere .",
    "the excitation term @xmath113 describes the unpolarized equal intensity pumping of bright and dark exciton states .",
    "such pumping corresponds to our experimental conditions : nonresonant excitation well above the exciton energy and fast relaxation of hot excitons to the ground state , assisted by optical phonons and interaction with the surface @xcite . for short pulse excitation",
    "one may assume @xmath114 and complete the model by assuming the initial conditions @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the total number of nanocrystals with exciton energy such that it can be excited by the laser pulse .",
    "for cw excitation @xmath117 . we have determined the solutions below for the case of cw excitation .",
    "to obtain these steady state solutions we take @xmath118 and solve the system of four linear equations for @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 : @xmath123 where @xmath124 and we used the relations @xmath125 to approximate the solutions .",
