    "in providing a unified framework for the description of fundamental interactions , the gauge principle has proved very successful .",
    "the electromagnetic , weak and strong interactions are all described by gauge theories , and so it is natural to consider the gauge group description of gravitation . in the gravitational case , however , in place of gauging an internal compact semi - simple lie symmetry group , one must apply the gauge principle to spacetime symmetries , which act on spacetime coordinates as well as on the dynamical fields .",
    "all experiments to date show that the non - gravitational fundamental interactions are consistent with the underlying spacetime symmetry of the poincar group , and so in attempting to develop a gauge approach to gravitation it is most natural to begin by constructing a physical theory invariant under local poincar transformations .",
    "as in the gauging of internal symmetries , this process requires the introduction of new , compensating gauge fields , which represent gravitational interactions .    following an initial attempt by utiyama@xcite , the idea of gauging the poincar group was fully developed by kibble@xcite ( and also considered by sciama@xcite ) .",
    "the physical model envisaged in kibble s approach is an underlying minkowski spacetime in which a matter field ( or fields ) @xmath0 with energy - momentum and , in general , spin - angular - momentum is distributed continuously .",
    "the field dynamics are described by a matter action @xmath1 that is invariant under global poincar transformations . by then demanding the matter action",
    "be invariant with respect to ( infinitesimal , passively interpreted ) local poincar transformations , in which the ten poincar group parameters become arbitrary functions of position , one is led to the introduction of the new field variables @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which are interpreted as gravitational gauge fields corresponding , respectively , to the translational and ( lorentz ) rotational parts of the poincar group . to construct a matter action that is invariant under local poincar transformations ,",
    "the gravitational gauge fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 are used to assemble a covariant derivative @xmath4 , and the matter action in the presence of gravity is typically obtained by the minimal coupling procedure of replacing partial derivatives in the special - relativistic matter lagrangian by covariant ones , to obtain @xmath5 ( where the factor containing @xmath6 is required to make the integrand a scalar density rather than a scalar ) . as for any gauge theory , the form of the covariant derivative defines its structure , and the result in this case is known as poincar gauge theory ( pgt ) .",
    "kibble s approach improved considerably on the earlier work of utiyama , who introduced the fields @xmath7 by localising just the lorentz symmetry , while the @xmath8 were treated as given functions of spacetime position ( although at a later stage these functions were regarded as dynamical variables ) .",
    "in addition to the matter action , the total action must also contain terms describing the dynamics of the free gravitational gauge fields .",
    "indeed , the choice of these terms defines the precise form of poincar gauge theory under consideration . following the normal procedure used in gauging internal symmetries , kibble first constructed covariant field strength tensors for the gauge fields by commuting covariant derivatives , i.e. by considering @xmath9{\\varphi}$ ]",
    ". this procedure yields two field strength tensors : @xmath10 corresponding to the gauge field @xmath7 arising from the ( lorentz ) rotational part of the poincar group ; and @xmath11 corresponding to the gauge field @xmath8 arising from the translational part , where ( suppressing indices for brevity ) we have indicated the functional dependence of each field strength tensor on the gauge fields and their derivatives@xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that each field strength tensor is linear in the derivatives of the gauge field to which it corresponds .",
    "the free gravitational action then takes the form @xmath12 , where the lagrangian @xmath13 is a scalar depending on the two field strengths .",
    "the total action is taken as the sum of the matter and gravitational actions , and variation of the total action with respect to the gauge fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 leads to two coupled gravitational field equations in which the energy - momentum @xmath14 and spin - angular - momentum @xmath15 of the matter field act as sources , where @xmath16 .",
    "in contrast to standard yang ",
    "mills gauge theory , in pgt one can construct an invariant for use in @xmath13 that is linear in the derivatives of the gauge fields , namely @xmath17 . indeed ,",
    "kibble chose simply to set @xmath18 , which defines the so - called einstein  cartan ( ec ) theory , which , when re - interpreted geometrically , is a direct generalisation of general relativity to include torsion sourced by the spin - angular - momentum ( if any ) of the matter field .    following kibble s work , several other approaches to gauging the poincar group have been proposed , although they are all closely related to his original derivation .",
    "for example , kibble s passive interpretation of the transformations has been criticised by hehl et al.@xcite , who reproduced kibble s derivation from the standpoint of active transformations of the matter fields .",
    "in essence , kibble considered the ` total ' variation @xmath19 of the matter fields under the action of a passive infinitesimal local poincar coordinate transformation , whereas hehl et al . and",
    "others@xcite considered instead the ` form ' variation @xmath20 .",
    "the latter approach is closer in spirit to the gauging of internal symmetries , since the form variation allows one to realise the representation of the poincar group as an active transformation in the space of the matter fields @xmath0 . nonetheless , the transformation properties of the resulting gauge fields , as well as the form of the covariant derivative , are independent of these details , so that the final structure of the theory is the same@xcite .",
    "hehl et al .",
    "further proposed that , in the matter field transformation @xmath21 , the partial derivative in the translational generator be replaced by a covariant one to preserve its geometric meaning after localisation of the poincar symmetry .",
    "it is easily shown , however , that their new form for the variation differs from the original @xmath21 only by a local lorentz transformation and , therefore , invariance of a matter action under one form of the variation implies invariance under the other .",
    "in fact , it is unnecessary to consider only infinitesimal transformations .",
    "mukunda@xcite considered finite local passive poincar transformations and again arrived at a theory equivalent to kibble s .",
    "lasenby , doran and gull@xcite also consider finite transformations , but interpreted actively , and arrive at a gauge theory of gravity with the same mathematical structure as kibble s theory , although formulated in the powerful language of geometric algebra , which greatly simplifies their subsequent application of the theory to various astrophysical and cosmological scenarios . in essence , however , all the above formulations are equivalent approaches to the localisation of poincar symmetry .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that the gauge approach to gravitation is naturally interpreted as a field theory in minkowski spacetime@xcite , in the same way as the gauge field theories describing the other fundamental interactions , and this is the viewpoint that we shall adopt in this paper .",
    "it is more common , however , to reinterpret the mathematical structure of pgt geometrically , whereby @xmath8 and @xmath7 are considered as the components of a vierbein system and a local spin connection , respectively , in a more general riemann ",
    "cartan spacetime possessing non - zero curvature and torsion@xcite . for a thorough ,",
    "modern account of the gauge approach to gravitation , see blagojevic@xcite , in which many of the issues above are discussed in some detail .",
    "although kibble chose the simple gravitational lagrangian @xmath18 , it is clear that numerous higher - order invariants can be constructed from the field strength tensors @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and their inclusion in @xmath13 can not be ruled out _ a priori_. nonetheless , if one demands that the dynamics of each gauge field must be determined by a source current which corresponds to the same gauge group generator , one is naturally led to models with a lagrangian @xmath13 that is quadratic in the ` curvature ' and ` torsion ' .",
    "the use of terms quadratic in the field strengths also mimics conventional gauge theory .",
    "in addition , one can typically ensure coincidence ( or small difference ) of predictions of pgt with those of general relativity in macroscopic domains , where einstein s theory is satisfactorily verified by observations and experiments , by adding the linear hilbert - einstein term@xcite .",
    "hence , one is led to consider @xmath24 where @xmath25 is einstein s gravitational constant , @xmath26 is a cosmological constant , @xmath27 is a dimensionless free parameter ( which is usually positive with the sign conventions adopted in this paper@xcite ) , and    @xmath28 l_{{\\cal t}^2 } & = & \\beta_1 { \\cal t}_{abc}{\\cal    t}^{abc } + \\beta_2 { \\cal t}_{abc}{\\cal t}^{bac } + \\beta_3 { \\cal t}_a{\\cal t}^a , \\label{lt2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in which the @xmath29 and @xmath30 are also dimensionless free parameters .",
    "note that pseudoscalar terms have been omitted by requiring parity invariance ; parity - odd terms have been investigated previously@xcite and may , in principle , be included in the free - gravitational lagrangian , but we do not consider them here . also , one may use the generalised gauss  bonnet identity to set one of @xmath31 , @xmath32 or @xmath33 to zero , without loss of generality .",
    "we have written @xmath13 in the form ( [ pgtlg ] ) so that , in natural units ( @xmath34 , which we will adopt throughout ) , it has dimensions of @xmath35 , and hence the corresponding action @xmath36 is dimensionless ; note that in natural units @xmath37 has dimensions of @xmath38 and @xmath26 has dimensions of @xmath39 .    in general , the equations of motion resulting from ( [ pgtlg ] ) contain derivatives of the gauge fields of no higher than second order . indeed , restricting the lagrangian to be at most quadratic in the field strengths , and hence at most quadratic in the first derivatives of the gauge fields , ensures one satisfies the so - called pseudolinearity hypothesis@xcite , which suggests that the field equations should be linear in the highest ( i.e. second ) order derivatives of the gauge fields@xcite .",
    "most importantly , the absence from the equations of motion of higher - order time derivatives of the fields ensures that such theories do not suffer from ostrogradsky s instability@xcite , wherein the corresponding hamiltonian is not bounded from below , so the energy of the system can take an arbitrarily negative value .",
    "while such a system for a free theory is not pathological , when it is coupled to a normal ( matter ) system with positive energy , the total system can ` evaporate ' into excitations of positive and negative energy degrees of freedom .",
    "ostrogradsky s instability is a quite generic feature of higher - derivative theories and may explain why nature is described by theories having second - order equations of motion .",
    "we note that , although there are 40 dynamical variables @xmath8 ( or , equivalently , the components @xmath40 of the inverse @xmath41-field ) and @xmath7 , the ` curvature ' and ` torsion ' field strengths are defined in terms of their antisymmetric derivatives and so do not depend on the time derivatives of @xmath42 and @xmath43 ; thus 10 of the field equations represent constraints on initial data . among the remaining 30 variables @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xmath46 , one can impose 10 gauge conditions by fixing the 10 parameters of the local poincar symmetry , reducing the number of independent variables to 20 .",
    "the large number of free parameters in @xmath13 clearly offers many possibilities for constructing pgts .",
    "for example , one of the simplest generalizations of ec theory is the so - called @xmath47 theory , for which @xmath48 . like ec theory , however , this generalisation does not contain a kinetic part for the rotational gauge field @xmath7 , so that the equations of motion couple the translation gauge field strength @xmath23 ( or the torsion in the geometrical reinterpretation of pgt ) _ algebraically _ to the spin density of the matter field ; hence the ` torsion ' is a non - propagating field , i.e. it must vanish outside of any matter sources . in a dynamical sense , therefore , ec and @xmath47 theories are incomplete : the rotational gauge field @xmath7 is introduced as an independent field , but the dynamics imposes an algebraic relation between the @xmath49-field and the matter spin - density .",
    "the @xmath49-field becomes fully dynamical only through the quadratic ` curvature ' terms in @xmath50 , in which case the ` torsion ' becomes a propagating field .",
    "consequently , a number of @xmath51-type theories have been investigated , as have @xmath52 theories@xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the latter allow the possibility of repulsive torsion interactions at small distances , which may prevent gravitational collapse to infinite matter densities@xcite .",
    "a summary of the properties of general @xmath53 theories is given by obukhov et al.@xcite .",
    "the properties of even more general actions , and the coupling to matter fields , have been discussed@xcite . in broad terms , if @xmath13 consists of @xmath54 and @xmath55 terms , then it contains dimensional constants , which is not an attractive property for quantisation . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath56 terms contain dimensionless constants , but the classical limit of theories without the linear curvature term @xmath54 is questionable@xcite .    despite the advantages of the above framework for constructing @xmath57 , certain general difficulties do arise that go beyond merely the paucity of guiding physical principles for elucidating the magnitude or origin of the many free parameters in @xmath13 , or the algebraic complexity of the resulting field equations .",
    "for example , although the field equations that follow from the variational principle are of second differential order , if one substitutes for the rotational gauge field @xmath7 in terms of @xmath8 one can rewrite them in a form that contains third - order derivatives , and it becomes difficult to assess whether they are well - posed@xcite .",
    "a judicious choice of the parameters in @xmath13 can eliminate such higher derivatives from the theory@xcite , although the resulting theories are not without their difficulties , such the lack of a sensible newtonian limit or well - defined initial value problem@xcite . nonetheless , the general structure of the equations of motion has been analysed to clarify the evolution of given initial data , i.e. the cauchy problem .",
    "of the 40 equations of motion , it is found that 10 represent constraints on the initial data , as mentioned above , and the remaining 30 define a consistent time evolution of the dynamical variables provided that the parameters @xmath27 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the lagrangian @xmath13 obey certain conditions@xcite .    in assessing various pgts as candidate theories of gravitation ,",
    "however , the issues of greatest interest are renormalisability and unitarity , both of which can be investigated by examining the particle content of the theory .",
    "this is performed by first linearizing the 40 gauge fields @xmath58 and @xmath7 about the trivial vacuum solution to the field equations and retaining only those terms in the lagrangian @xmath13 that are bilinear in the linearized gauge fields to obtain @xmath59 . after transforming to momentum space",
    ", one chooses covariant basis states , so that @xmath59 , when considered as a @xmath60-matrix in field space , becomes mostly zeroes .",
    "the covariant basis states are constructed using @xmath61-space projection operators@xcite , which decompose the linearised gauge fields into tensors that reduce to states of definite spin - parity @xmath62 in a ` rest - frame ' where @xmath63 has only a time component , and are thus irreducible representations of the poincar group .",
    "one finds that of the 20 independent degrees of freedom in the gauge fields , two correspond to the massless _ graviton _ ( with spin - parity @xmath64 ) and the decomposition of @xmath45 @xmath46 yields ( in general , massive ) _ tordions _ ( or _ rotons _ ) with spin - parities of @xmath65 , with @xmath66 degrees of freedom .",
    "the propagator is simply ( minus ) the inverse of the terms in the resulting bilinear lagrangian@xcite .    for a theory to be unitary",
    ", its particle spectrum must be free from ghosts ( particles with negative definite free - field energy , which destroys the unitarity of the @xmath67 matrix ) and tachyons ( particles which propagate faster than light and therefore violate causality ) .",
    "one can check for ghosts or tachyons by examining the residues and locations of the propagator poles , which generally depend in a complicated way on all the parameters @xmath27 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the original lagrangian @xmath13 .",
    "the condition for no tachyons is that the propagator has first - order poles for non - negative @xmath68 , whereas the condition for no ghosts is that the matrix of the residues at the poles is positive definite . in other words ,",
    "each element of the diagonalized propagator must be of the form @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( assuming a ` mostly minus ' metric signature ) .",
    "these requirements follow from the spectral representation of the vacuum expectation value of the time - ordered product@xcite . in pgt , for the general case in which all the tordion modes are massive , there exist ranges of values of the parameters in @xmath13 ( that divide into 5 broad classes ) for which the resulting pgt is indeed unitary@xcite .",
    "if one further requires that the torsion propagates , one finds that there are 12 six - parameter lagrangians that lead to unitary theories@xcite . for the special case",
    "in which there are massless tordion modes , and hence the possibility of long - range torsion effects , it is important to take into account the transversality relations between residues ( for example , they are needed to eliminate ghosts from general relativity ) . in this case , the results are not so complete@xcite .",
    "nonetheless , at least one 3-parameter lagrangian exists that propagates ( only ) a massless @xmath72 tordion and results in a unitary theory@xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that a generic feature of massless tordion lagrangians is the appearance of extra gauge symmetries .",
    "the introduction of a scalar field allows for a still larger choice of unitary lagrangians@xcite .    for a theory to be power - counting renormalisable ,",
    "one requires good high - energy behaviour of the propagators for its constituent particles .",
    "in particular , in all spin sectors , the propagators for the graviton should behave as @xmath73 , whereas those for the tordions should be @xmath74 , since tordion vertices are better behaved than those of gravitons@xcite .",
    "pure @xmath75 poles can occur in pgt , but are forbidden since they give rise to field modes with free - field energies not bounded from below ( ` dipole - ghosts')@xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the pgt propagator also has pole structures of the form @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "these can be tolerated in lower spin - sectors , since the resulting ghost mode may be compensated by lower - spin terms in the higher - spin projection operators .",
    "this can not occur in the spin-2 sector , however , and so any power - counting renormalizable pgt will have ghosts in the spin-2 sector@xcite .",
    "conversely , to remove the ghosts , the @xmath77 propagators must cancel , making the theory power - counting non - renormalizable . indeed , for unitary massive - tordion lagrangians , the graviton propagator goes @xmath74 and the tordion propagator tends to a constant at high energies . for the massless propagating @xmath72 tordion lagrangian",
    ", however , the tordion propagator goes as @xmath78 , leading to improved ultraviolet behaviour@xcite .",
    "although power - counting renormalizable pgts are not unitary , and _ vice - versa _ , it still remains possible that unitary pgts are renormalizable when higher - order loops are taken into account , but relatively little is known .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that , in the absence of torsion , @xmath51 theories are renormalizable ( but not unitary ) .",
    "the renormalisability of ec theory and the quantum effect of quadratic torsion terms at one - loop level have been investigated@xcite .",
    "more innovative approaches to quantisation of pgt have been pursued@xcite , but are also problematic@xcite .",
    "the lack of a clear route to quantising pgt has led to interest in imposing extra gauge symmetries beyond local poincar symmetry , since this could , in principle , lead to surprises that might allow for a simultaneously unitary and renormalizable theory@xcite , without having to resort to non - local theories@xcite .",
    "in particular , perhaps the most natural extension of pgt is also to demand local scale invariance , which might resolve some of the problems outlined above@xcite , since such theories contain no absolute energy scale .",
    "it should be noted , however , that scale invariance defines an unacceptable transformation law for particle masses .",
    "if scale invariance were to hold in nature it would imply that the mass spectrum is either continuous ( if @xmath79 ) or all the masses vanish .",
    "thus scale invariance must be a broken symmetry in a world with non - vanishing , discrete particle masses .",
    "the most direct approach to constructing gauge theories of gravity that are invariant under local changes of scale , in addition to local poincar transformations , is to gauge the weyl group w(1,3 ) , which extends poincar symmetry to include scale invariance and is a sub - group of the full conformal group c(1,3)@xcite .",
    "this may be formulated in a number of ways , e.g. by considering the weyl transformations as active or passive , infinitesmial or finite , but they are all essentially equivalent . as in pgt , one assumes the physical model of an underlying minkowski spacetime in which a continuum matter field ( or fields ) @xmath0 with energy - momentum and , in general , spin - angular - momentum is distributed continuously .",
    "now , however , the field dynamics are described by a matter action @xmath80 that is invariant under global weyl coordinate transformations , which imposes much more severe constraints on the form of the action . by then demanding the matter action to be invariant with respect to local weyl transformations ,",
    "in which the eleven weyl group parameters become arbitrary functions of position , one is again led to the introduction of gauge fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( although the transformation rules of the former are different to those in pgt ) and also a new gravitational gauge field @xmath81 corresponding to the dilation part of the weyl group@xcite . similar to pgt ,",
    "the gravitational gauge fields @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath81 are used to assemble a covariant derivative @xmath82 , and the matter action in the presence of gravity is obtained by the minimal coupling procedure , so that @xmath83 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the requirement of local scale invariance imposes tight constraints on the precise form of @xmath84 . in particular , since @xmath85 has a weyl ( or conformal ) weight @xmath86 ( see section  [ sec : lmwgt ] ) , the lagrangian @xmath84 must have a weight @xmath87 .    as in pgt ,",
    "the action term describing the dynamics of the free gravitational gauge fields is assembled by first constructing covariant field strength tensors for the gauge fields by commuting covariant derivatives , i.e. by considering @xmath88{\\varphi}$ ] .",
    "one obtains @xmath89 and @xmath90 as before ( but where the form of the latter differs from that in pgt ) and an additional field strength @xmath91 corresponding to the new gauge field @xmath81 arising from the dilation part of the weyl group ( we have again indicated the functional dependence of each field strength tensor on the gauge fields and their derivatives , suppressing indices for brevity ) . as in pgt , each field strength tensor is linear in the derivatives the gauge field to which it corresponds .",
    "the free gravitational action then has the general form @xmath92 . as usual , the total action is taken as the sum of the matter and gravitational actions , and variation of the total action with respect to the gauge fields @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath81 leads to three coupled gravitational field equations in which the energy - momentum @xmath14 , spin - angular - momentum @xmath93 and dilation current @xmath94 of the matter field act as sources .",
    "the free gravitational lagrangian @xmath13 must also have a weyl ( conformal ) weight @xmath87 , which places tight constraints on its form .",
    "it is easily shown that @xmath95 and @xmath96 , which means that @xmath13 can be quadratic in @xmath97 and @xmath98 , while terms linear in @xmath99 or quadratic in @xmath100 are not allowed , despite them transforming covariantly under local weyl transformations .",
    "thus , in wgt , the general form of @xmath13 , possessing terms no higher than quadratic order in the field strengths , and hence at most quadratic in the first derivatives of gauge fields , is of @xmath101 type :    @xmath102    where the @xmath29 and @xmath103 are dimensionless free parameters . once again pseudo - scalar terms have been omitted by requiring parity invariance , and one may use the generalised gauss  bonnet identity to set one of @xmath31 , @xmath32 or @xmath33 to zero , without loss of generality .",
    "evidently , local weyl invariance removes many of the possibilities that exist in pgt ; essentially the @xmath54 and @xmath104 terms , which possess dimensional constants , are forbidden .",
    "although the requirement that each term in the total lagrangian must have a weyl weight @xmath105 clearly places quite restrictive conditions on its form , one can construct further weyl - covariant terms with the appropriate weight for inclusion in the lagrangian by introducing an additional massless scalar field ( or fields ) @xmath106 with weyl weight @xmath107 , often termed the compensator(s ) @xcite .",
    "this opens up possibilities for the inclusion of further action terms in which the scalar field is non - minimally ( conformally ) coupled to the field strength tensors of the gravitational gauge fields , combined ( usually ) with an additional free kinetic term for @xmath106 . for example , terms proportional to @xmath108 or @xmath109 are weyl - covariant with weight @xmath110 and so may be added to the total lagrangian .",
    "the inclusion of the term @xmath108 has been widely investigated @xcite , whereas the phenomenological value of the @xmath109 terms has received relatively little attention@xcite . in any case , the resulting total lagrangian is at most quadratic in the first derivatives of the gauge fields , thereby satisfying the pseudolinearity hypothesis that field equations be linear in the second - order derivatives of the gauge field , and hence ensuring that such theories do not suffer from ostrogradsky s instability .",
    "the inclusion of scalar fields also allows for more flexibility in the allowed forms of the matter energy - momentum tensor .",
    "let us take as an example the action for a free dirac field @xmath111 , which has weyl weight @xmath112 .",
    "this action is not scale - invariant owing to the mass term @xmath113 , so it appears that one requires the field to be massless , which clearly can not describe ` ordinary ' matter .",
    "one may reach the same conclusion by noting that in wgt the trace of the total matter energy - momentum tensor must equal the covariant divergence of the dilation current@xcite @xmath114 . in the case of dirac matter",
    ", the lagrangian resulting from gauging the weyl symmetry , curiously , does not contain the dilation gauge field @xmath81 .",
    "hence , for dirac matter on its own , the energy - momentum tensor of @xmath111 must be traceless , which again requires the field to be massless .",
    "these difficulties can be circumvented , however , by making the replacement @xmath115 in the dirac action , where @xmath116 is a dimensionless parameter but @xmath117 has the dimensions of mass in natural units .",
    "although the trace of the total energy momentum tensor of the @xmath111 and @xmath106 fields must still vanish , the energy - momentum tensor of the dirac matter field @xmath111 itself need not be traceless , thereby allowing it to be massive .",
    "indeed , this approach to the construction of gauge theories of gravity that are scale - invariant but , at the same time , are able to accommodate ` ordinary ' matter was first explored by dirac@xcite in the context of attempting to establish a deeper physical understanding of his ` large numbers hypothesis ' relating microscopic ( quantum ) and macroscopic ( gravitational ) scales .",
    "in particular , dirac hoped that the additional scalar field @xmath106 might provide a time - dependent coupling of gravitation to matter , hence allowing the newtonian gravitational ` constant ' @xmath118 to vary with cosmic epoch .",
    "this idea can be naturally accommodated in the framework of wgt@xcite ( and extended to include non - zero torsion , which was assumed to vanish by dirac ) .    in general ,",
    "the introduction of scalar matter fields in wgt , and scale - invariant theories more generally , is also important since they provide a natural means for spontaneously breaking the scale symmetry , which is necessary to achieve an acceptable long - range limit .",
    "the approach most commonly adopted is to use local scale invariance to set the compensator scalar field @xmath106 to a constant value in the resulting field equations , which is known as the einstein gauge .",
    "setting @xmath119 in the equation of motion for the dirac field @xmath111 , for example , leads to its interpretation as a massive field with @xmath120 .",
    "it is usually considered that setting @xmath119 represents the choice of some definite scale in the theory , thereby breaking scale - invariance .",
    "indeed , it is often given the physical interpretation of corresponding to some spontaneous breaking of the scale symmetry ( where nature chooses the gauge ) . as we show in section  [ sec : wgteinstein ] , however , this interpretation is questionable . in particular , we demonstrate in wgt that the equations of motion in the einstein gauge are identical in form to those obtained when working in scale - invariant variables , where the latter involves no breaking of the scale symmetry .",
    "this suggests that one should introduce further scalar fields , in addition to the compensator field @xmath106 , to enable a true physical breaking of the scale symmetry .",
    "in general , the phenomenology of wgt is far less well understood than that of pgt . as for pgt",
    ", the presence of @xmath121 terms in the action improves the quantum renormalisability of such theories , but can again lead to problems with unitarity@xcite .",
    "these issues , as well as the stability of the ground state , have yet to be resolved , but the development of a full phenomenological basis for wgt remains of considerable theoretical interest .    in this paper , however , our primary aim is to present a novel alternative to wgt by considering a more general ` extended ' transformation law for the rotational gauge field under local dilations , which includes its ` normal ' transformation law in wgt as a special case .",
    "this is motivated by the observation that the pgt ( and wgt ) matter actions both for the dirac field and the electromagnetic field are already invariant under local dilations if one assumes this ` extended ' transformation law , in the same way as they are for the ` normal ' transformation law assumed in wgt .",
    "moreover , under a global scale transformation , the two transformation laws coincide , and so both may be considered as an equally valid gauging of global weyl scale invariance .",
    "the key difference between the two sets of transformations is that , whereas under the ` normal ' weyl transformations the pgt gauge fields @xmath8 and @xmath7 transform covariantly with weights of @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively , under the ` extended ' transformations the rotational gauge field @xmath7 transforms inhomogeneously .",
    "this also has the consequence that the transformation properties of the pgt rotational gauge field strength ( or ` curvature ' ) @xmath125 and translational gauge field strength ( or ` torsion ' ) @xmath126 are treated in a more balanced manner .",
    "the resulting ` extended ' weyl gauge theory ( ewgt ) has a number of interesting features that we describe in detail , although we focus here only on its formal description and postpone a full discussion of its application and phenomenology to future publications .    finally , it is worth mentioning that one can also construct gauge theories of gravity that are invariant under local changes of scale ( assuming either the normal or extended transformation law for the rotational gauge field ) , in addition to local poincar transformations , _ without _ gauging the weyl group .",
    "instead , one works entirely in terms of pgt objects , such as matter fields @xmath0 and their pgt covariant derivatives @xmath4 , the pgt gauge field strengths @xmath97 and @xmath23 ( or even their simpler counterparts in the absence of ` torsion ' ) , and a ( compensator ) scalar field @xmath106 ( as discussed above ) .",
    "these are used to construct terms in the free gravitational and matter actions that individually are not necessarily invariant ( or even covariant ) under ( extended ) local scale changes , but by taking the appropriate linear combinations of such terms , it is possible to arrive at a free gravitational action and matter action that are locally scale - invariant ( and hence so is the total action)@xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is arranged as follows . in section  [ sec : wgt ] , we establish our general approach to constructing locally scale - invariant gauge theories of gravity by giving a brief outline of the mathematical structure of wgt , but in a way not usually presented in the literature . in particular , we maintain throughout the notion of @xmath8 , @xmath7 and @xmath81 as gauge fields in minkowski spacetime , rather than adopting the more usual geometric interpretation of wgt in terms of the curvature and torsion of a weyl ",
    "cartan @xmath127 spacetime ( although we do give a brief account of the latter ) ; this is in keeping with the gauge field theories describing the other fundamental interactions and has some non - trivial consequences .",
    "we also work exclusively in terms of finite local weyl transformations , rather than their usual infinitesimal forms ; the former allows , in our view , for a more transparent interpretation of wgt .",
    "we also make some observations that differ from typical accounts of the subject , in particular regarding the interpretation of the einstein gauge and also the equations of motion of matter fields and test particles . in section  [ sec : ewgt ] , we present our novel alternative to wgt , obtained by demanding invariance under a more general form for the transformation law of the rotational gauge field under local dilations , and describe the general properties of the resulting ` extended ' weyl gauge theory ( ewgt ) ; we also discuss its interpretation in terms of a new spacetime geometry ( that we term @xmath128 ) , which is an extended form of weyl ",
    "cartan @xmath127 spacetime . in section  [ sec :",
    "sigtg ] , we present a new scale - invariant gauge theory of gravity that can accommodate ordinary matter , and is defined by the most general ewgt lagrangian that is at most quadratic in the ewgt field strengths , and we derive its field equations . in section  [ sec : lsipgt ] , we briefly discuss the construction of pgt actions that are invariant under local dilations . we conclude in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "in addition , we include six appendices .",
    "appendix  [ appendix : dirac ] presents a re - expression of the special - relativistic lagrangian of a dirac field , which lends itself to the development of a semi - classical description of a spinning point particle , which we will use as our model of ` ordinary ' matter .",
    "appendix  [ app : pgt ] provides a brief description of pgt as a special case , with appropriate notational modifications , of our discussion of wgt in section  [ sec : wgt ] , and appendix  [ ectheory ] summarises the particular pgt originally considered by kibble , namely einstein  cartan theory . in appendix",
    "[ appendix : dgt ] , as an example of a wgt , we describe the first proposed scale - invariant theory of gravity that can accommodate ` ordinary ' matter , which was explored by dirac@xcite , but extend it to include non - zero torsion . in appendix",
    "[ appendix : altddagderiv ] , we present an alternative approach to deriving the form of the covariant derivative in ewgt , which is complementary to that presented in section  [ sec : ewgt ] . finally , in appendix  [ appendix : notation ] , we present a summary of our notation .",
    "the phenomenology of ewgt and its application to astrophysics and cosmology will be described in forthcoming papers .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the minimal and perhaps most natural extension of pgt is based on gauging the weyl group w(1,3 ) , which extends poincar symmetry to include scale invariance .",
    "thus , in traditional weyl gauge theory ( wgt ) , in addition to local poincar symmetry , one also demands invariance under local change of scale .",
    "we give an account of the mathematical structure of wgt here .",
    "in particular , we will interpret weyl transformations passively , but consider them in their more transparent finite form , rather than as infinitesimal transformations .",
    "the notation used broadly follows kibble@xcite and mukunda@xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that , with appropriate notational modifications , the following discussion also serves as an account of pgt , which may be considered as a special case of wgt , as described in appendix  [ app : pgt ] .",
    "we begin with a minkowski spacetime @xmath129 , labelled using cartesian inertial coordinates @xmath130 , on which the dynamics of some multiplet of ` matter ' ( i.e. non - gravitational ) fields @xmath131 is described by a matter action @xmath132 that is invariant under global weyl transformations , which imposes much more severe constraints on the form of the action than those required by mere global poincar invariance .",
    "we denote the coordinate basis vectors by @xmath133 , which are tangents to the coordinate curves and for cartesian inertial coordinates satisfy @xmath134 , where @xmath135 . at each point of @xmath129",
    ", we can also define a local lorentz reference frame , unrelated to the coordinates @xmath130 , which is represented by an orthonormal tetrad @xmath136 , such that @xmath137 . in global cartesian",
    "inertial coordinates @xmath130 , we can always choose the tetrad such that it coincides with a coordinate frame @xmath138 , i.e. @xmath139 .",
    "we will adopt the common convention that latin indices refer to local tetrad frames , while greek indices refer to coordinate frames .",
    "we suppose that our multiplet of matter fields @xmath131 belongs to some representation of the weyl group .",
    "more precisely , we replace the usual lorentz subgroup @xmath140 by @xmath141 , so that spinor fields can be accommodated@xcite . indeed , by expressing @xmath131 in its 2-spinor form ,",
    "for example , one can always ensure that its components carry no coordinate ( greek ) indices .",
    "such an approach can be rather cumbersome , however , and so we adopt a more straightforward notation in which the matter field components @xmath142 simply carry a generic roman index ( or set of indices ) to denote that they are ` referred to ' a local lorentz frame .",
    "thus , matter field components ( which may be expressed in 2-spinor , 4-spinor or 4-tensor form , as is most convenient ) behave as scalars under a change of coordinates , but transform under a corresponding rotation of the local tetrad frames ( such that they coincide with the new coordinate frame at each point ) or physical dilations according to their @xmath141 representation and weyl weight ( see below ) , respectively .",
    "this distinction will become important shortly , when we consider localising the weyl symmetry .",
    "thus , under a global weyl transformation @xmath143 the multiplet of matter fields transforms via @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the matrix corresponding to the element @xmath26 of the lorentz group ( or sl(2,c ) group ) in the representation to which @xmath131 belongs ( we have suppressed lorentz indices on these objects for notational simplicity ) , and @xmath122 is the weyl ( or conformal ) weight of the field @xmath131 .",
    "moreover , the derivatives of the matter fields transform as @xmath146 it is worth briefly considering in an explicitly geometrical manner the dilation part of the weyl transformation , i.e.  with @xmath147 and @xmath148 in ( [ weyl ] ) and ( [ weylpsitrans ] ) .",
    "this transformation may be considered as consisting of two distinct parts .",
    "the first part physically ( actively ) dilates the minkowski spacetime such that the distance between any two points is increased by a factor @xmath149 . adopting global inertial coordinates , such that @xmath150 , the metric must therefore transform according to @xmath151 . hence",
    ", under this active dilation the metric has a weyl weight of @xmath152 .",
    "note , however , that no coordinate transformation has occurred , since every point in the spacetime still has its original coordinate labels ; one may consider the coordinates as being ` embedded ' in the spacetime as it dilates .",
    "the second part of the transformation consists of a coordinate transformation @xmath153 , which ` shrinks ' the coordinate system back to its original ` size ' . under this coordinate transformation , @xmath154 and so , overall",
    ", the metric remains unchanged .",
    "this distinction between the two parts of the weyl dilation will become important when we localise the weyl symmetry , at which point they decouple completely .    for invariance of the matter action under a global weyl transformation ( [ weyl ] ) ( for which the jacobian equals @xmath155 )",
    ", a sufficient condition is that the matter lagrangian density satisfies @xmath156 where the arguments on the lhs are given by ( [ weylpsitrans ] ) and ( [ weyldpsitrans ] ) , respectively .    for our later purposes , it is useful to consider the concrete examples provided by the standard special - relativistic matter lagrangians for a massive free scalar field , a massive free dirac field and the electromagnetic field , respectively . for a ( real ) free scalar field @xmath106 of mass @xmath157 , one has the klein ",
    "gordon lagrangian @xmath158 and under the dilation part of a weyl transformation ( [ weyl][weylpsitrans ] ) , one thus obtains @xmath159 for invariance of the corresponding matter action , one requires ( [ weylinvariance ] ) to hold .",
    "thus , the free scalar field action is dilation invariant only for @xmath160 and provided the weyl weight of the field is taken as @xmath161 .",
    "one can perform a similar analysis for the lagrangian for a classical dirac field @xmath111 of mass @xmath157 , which is given by@xcite @xmath162 -m\\bar{\\psi}\\psi \\equiv \\tfrac{1}{2}i\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^\\mu{\\stackrel{\\leftrightarrow}{\\partial_\\mu}}\\psi - m\\bar{\\psi}\\psi . \\label{diraclm2}\\ ] ] where the kinetic energy term is written so as to ensure it is always real ( and the sign ensures the terms contribute positive energy on quantisation ) .",
    "under a dilation transformation , one obtains @xmath163 demanding ( [ weylinvariance ] ) to hold , one thus finds that the dirac action is dilation invariant only for @xmath160 and provided the weyl weight of the dirac field is taken as @xmath164 , which is consistent with the interpretation of @xmath165 as a number density .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , however , one can circumvent this restriction to a massless dirac field by introducing a massless scalar field @xmath106 and making the replacement @xmath166 in the dirac lagrangian , where @xmath116 is a dimensionless parameter , combined usually with an additional kinetic term for @xmath106 .",
    "one thus obtains @xmath167 which is easily shown to be invariant under a dilation transformation and describes a massless dirac field interacting with a massless scalar field . if one then adopts the einstein gauge @xmath119 in the resulting field equations , however , one may interpret @xmath111 as a massive field with @xmath120 .",
    "finally , we consider the electromagnetic field @xmath168 ( which should not be confused with the ` rotational ' gravitational gauge field @xmath7 ) , for which the special - relativistic lagrangian is given by @xmath169 where @xmath170 and @xmath171 is some source current density . under a dilation transformation ,",
    "one thus obtains @xmath172 where @xmath122 and @xmath173 are the weyl weights of @xmath168 and @xmath174 respectively .",
    "thus we see that the lagrangian satisfies ( [ weylinvariance ] ) , provided that @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "it is worth noting that the dirac current @xmath177 satisfies this requirement .      in order to gauge the weyl transformation ( [ weyl][weylpsitrans ] )",
    ", one makes each of the six lorentz rotation parameters in @xmath26 , the four translation parameters @xmath178 and the dilation parameter @xmath179 into eleven independent arbitrary functions of @xmath180 .",
    "this leads to a complete decoupling of the translation parts of the transformation from the rotational and dilation parts .",
    "thus , it is customary to view @xmath181 as arising from a general coordinate transformation ( gct ) ( resulting in a consequent change in the coordinate basis vectors @xmath138 at each point ) , which does not refer at all to the local lorentz rotation @xmath182 of the orthonormal tetrad @xmath183 , or local ( physical ) dilation @xmath184 , at each point .",
    "the local lorentz rotation is still an element of @xmath140 ( or more precisely @xmath141 ) for each @xmath180 , and the basic transformation law for @xmath0 involves a local shuffling and scaling of components given by @xmath185 since the gct and the local lorentz rotation are completely decoupled it is convenient ( and common practice ) to use greek indices on spacetime coordinates @xmath130 and components of the gct , but use latin indices for local lorentz rotations @xmath186 .",
    "this means that any spinor , vector or tensor character that @xmath0 has in the special - relativistic theory now appears in its local lorentz transformation law , so that under a gct each component of @xmath0 ( carrying only latin indices ) behaves as a scalar field .",
    "consequently , the partial derivative , @xmath187 , is covariant under gct .",
    "we note that lowering and raising of latin indices is performed using the minkowski metric @xmath188 , whereas greek indices are raised and lowered using the ( flat - space ) metric @xmath189 and its inverse @xmath190 corresponding to the coordinate system @xmath130 used to label the minkowski spacetime .",
    "in particular , the duals of the orthonormal tetrad vectors and the coordinate basis vectors are given by @xmath191 and @xmath192 , respectively .",
    "moreover , the decoupling of the gct from the local lorentz rotation and local dilation transformations , means that the metric @xmath193 of the minkowski spacetime obeys the transformation law @xmath194    from ( [ weylpsitrans_gen ] ) , we see that the transformation law for the derivatives of @xmath0 under the gauged weyl transformation is given by    @xmath195 . \\label{weyldlpsitrans}\\ ] ]    in order to take advantage of the property ( [ weylinvariance ] ) , we need to construct a covariant derivative that transforms like ( [ weyldpsitrans ] ) under local weyl transformations .",
    "this is achieved in two steps .",
    "firstly , one defines the @xmath196-covariant derivative of the matter field as@xcite @xmath197{\\varphi}(x ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & [ d_\\mu + wb_\\mu(x)]{\\varphi}(x ) , \\label{weyldmudef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath198 is the @xmath26-covariant derivative introduced in pgt ; the asterisk on the derivative operator on the left - hand side is intended simply to distinguish it from @xmath198 , and should not be confused with the operation of complex conjugation .",
    "most importantly , @xmath199 is the gauge - field corresponding to the local lorentz rotations and @xmath200 is the gauge - field corresponding to local dilations .",
    "the matrices @xmath201 are the generators of the @xmath141 representation @xmath145 to which @xmath131 belongs , obeying the usual commutation rules @xmath202 = \\eta_{ad}\\sigma_{bc}-\\eta_{bd}\\sigma_{ac}+\\eta_{bc } \\sigma_{ad}-\\eta_{ac}\\sigma_{bd}.\\ ] ] given the antisymmetry of the generator matrices @xmath203 , without loss of generality we may take the @xmath49 gauge field to share this antisymmetry property , such that @xmath204 .",
    "the aim of introducing the @xmath49 and @xmath205 gauge fields is to compensate for the second and third terms in square brackets in ( [ weyldlpsitrans ] ) , so that the @xmath196-covariant derivative transforms under a combined gct , local lorentz rotation and local dilation as @xmath206 this is easily achieved by demanding that the rotational gauge field @xmath7 transforms as @xmath207 , \\label{atrans}\\ ] ] and the dilation gauge field @xmath81 transforms as @xmath208 .",
    "\\label{btransdef}\\ ] ] thus , @xmath7 and @xmath81 are covariant vectors under gct , but transform inhomogeneously under local lorentz transformations and local dilations , respectively , which is typical of gauge fields .",
    "we also note that @xmath7 is invariant under local dilations ( i.e. has weyl weight @xmath209 ) .    it is convenient sometimes to write the @xmath196-covariant derivative ( [ weyldmudef ] ) as @xmath210 { \\varphi}(x ) , \\label{dstardef}\\ ] ] where we have defined the derivative operator @xmath211 it is straightforward to show that @xmath212 itself also transforms covariantly with weight @xmath122 ( i.e. the same weight as the field @xmath0 ) under local dilations ( but does not transform covariantly under local poincar transformations ) .    in the second step ,",
    "we define a generalised covariant derivative , linearly related to @xmath213 , by introducing a new , ` translational ' gauge field @xmath214 that transforms via @xmath215 thus , the field @xmath8 is a contravariant gct vector , a local lorentz four - vector , and has weyl weight @xmath216 under local dilations .",
    "the inverse matrix is usually denoted by @xmath217 ( which has weyl weight @xmath218 ) and satisfies @xmath219 the generalised covariant derivative is then defined as @xmath220{\\varphi}(x ) , \\label{weylgencovdef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which consequently transforms under local weyl transformations in the same way as @xmath221 does under global weyl transformations , namely@xcite @xmath222 having achieved our goal of defining a general covariant derivative with the transformation law ( [ weylgencovtrans ] ) , we can take advantage of the property ( [ weylinvariance ] ) of the special - relativistic matter lagrangian , and we see that under the _ local _ weyl group one has @xmath223 thus the new minimally - coupled matter lagrangian is a gct and local lorentz scalar , and has a weyl weight @xmath110 .",
    "however , since @xmath224 is a gct , we need a scalar density , rather than a scalar , as the integrand in the matter action .",
    "moreover , the integrand must have an overall weyl weight of zero .",
    "thus we must multiply @xmath225 by a factor which transforms by the appropriate jacobian determinant of the gct and has a weyl weight @xmath226 . from the transformation properties of the @xmath49- , @xmath205- and @xmath41-fields , we see that the only suitable factor that does not involve derivatives is @xmath85 .",
    "thus , our final minimally - coupled matter action is @xmath227 which is invariant under local weyl transformations",
    ". it will be convenient to denote the integrand of the action by the lagrangian density @xmath228 .",
    "we note that the gravitational gauge fields @xmath41 , @xmath49 and @xmath205 contain a total of 44 independent variables .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that the locally - weyl - invariant matter action ( [ weylmatlag_gen ] ) is not guaranteed to inherit invariance properties possessed by the original action ( [ weylsraction ] ) under other types of transformation , so ( [ weylmatlag_gen ] ) may need to be modified to restore any further required invariances . an important example that illustrates this phenomenon is provided by the electromagnetic field , and is discussed in section  [ sec : wgtem ] . for the purposes of our general discussion , however , we will assume the action has the form ( [ weylmatlag_gen ] ) .    as mentioned previously , one may also introduce an additional ` compensator ' scalar field @xmath106 ( or fields ) into the matter action . the introduction of an additional scalar field opens up possibilities for the inclusion of further terms in the matter action that non - minimally ( conformally ) couple @xmath106 to the wgt gravitational gauge field strengths ( see section  [ sec : wgtgfs ] ) .",
    "in particular , terms proportional to @xmath108 or @xmath229 are weyl - covariant with weight @xmath110 and so may be added to @xmath84 ( where @xmath230 has the form ( [ lt2 ] ) , but with the pgt translational gauge field strength replaced by the corresponding quantity in wgt ) .      at this point , it is worth making a few observations that are not usually presented in the literature .",
    "firstly , we have introduced the @xmath41 , @xmath49 and @xmath205 fields as gravitational gauge fields in minkowski spacetime , in keeping with the interpretation of the gauge field theories describing the other fundamental interactions .",
    "we are therefore still at liberty to perform our calculations in a global inertial cartesian coordinate system @xmath130 . in making this choice",
    ", one may extend the @xmath196-covariant derivative @xmath231 to act on any quantity that transforms linearly under local lorentz transformations , even if it also carries greek indices , by simply ignoring its gct transformation properties , since the explicit form for the generators @xmath203 appearing in @xmath213 depends only on the lorentz transformation properties of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , for instance , considering the @xmath41-field itself , one has @xmath232 where @xmath233 are the generators of the vector representation of the lorentz group .",
    "similarly , for the inverse @xmath41-field , @xmath234 it may prove useful occasionally , however , to work in a different coordinate system in minkowski spacetime , such as spherical polar coordinates . in this case , we are obliged to generalise the @xmath196-covariant derivative so that it is capable of being applied to fields carrying greek indices , which have definite tensor behaviour under gct , in addition to @xmath141 behaviour . in this case , the @xmath196-covariant derivative in ( [ dstardef ] ) becomes @xmath235 where @xmath236 , @xmath237 is the metric connection corresponding to the ( flat - space ) metric @xmath193 defined by the coordinate system , and @xmath238 are the @xmath239 generator matrices appropriate to the gct tensor character of the field to which @xmath231 is applied , and @xmath122 is its weyl weight . once again taking the @xmath41-field as an example , one thus has @xmath240 it should be remembered , however , that in minkowski spacetime , the connection coefficients @xmath241 are not dynamical entities , but are fixed by our choice of coordinate system .",
    "moreover , the curvature and torsion tensors derived from the connection both vanish in minkowski spacetime , meaning that the derivatives @xmath242 and @xmath243 always commute , i.e. @xmath244{\\varphi}=0,\\ ] ] irrespective of the gct tensor character of @xmath0 .",
    "unless otherwise stated , however , from now on we will adopt a global cartesian inertial coordinate system @xmath130 in our minkowski spacetime , which greatly simplifies calculations .    finally , some further comments about the interpretation of the translational gauge field are worthwhile .",
    "it is a rank-2 tensor field , which we will denote by @xmath245 , defined on minkowski spacetime .",
    "thus , formally , it provides a linear mapping from any two vectors in minkowski spacetime to the real numbers . in the usual manner ,",
    "the components of @xmath245 that we have considered hitherto are given by @xmath246 .",
    "similarly , the inverse of @xmath245 , which we denote by @xmath247 , is also a rank-2 tensor field defined on minkowski spacetime , and the components that we have considered so far are given by @xmath248 .",
    "other components of @xmath245 and @xmath247 may be obtained in the usual manner by acting with them on different combinations of the tetrad and coordinate basis vectors and their duals .",
    "the two tensors @xmath245 and @xmath247 are inverses in the sense that the components @xmath8 and @xmath40 satisfy the conditions ( [ hinverse ] ) .",
    "given their transformation properties , the components of @xmath245 and @xmath247 are able to convert between gct tensor behaviour and the corresponding @xmath141 behaviour , i.e. they can be used to replace greek indices with latin ones and vice - versa ( although @xmath141 spinors can not be converted into any gct tensorial objects ) . as an example , let us consider the simplest case of a vector field @xmath249 defined on the minkowski spacetime , which may be written in terms of its components in the coordinate basis or its dual as @xmath250 . replacing the greek index with a latin one using the components of @xmath245 , we may obtain the quantities @xmath251 or @xmath252 . adopting the viewpoint that @xmath245 is a tensor ( gauge ) field in minkowski spacetime , and thus attaching to it no geometric significance _ a priori _ , one must regard these as the components in the local tetrad basis of a _ new _ vector field @xmath253@xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that the components of @xmath245 may also be used to convert latin indices into greek ones .",
    "for example , consider the vector @xmath254 , which has contravariant components in the coordinate basis given by @xmath255 ; these are the components of another _ new _ vector , and are , in general , _ not _ equal to the original @xmath174 .",
    "similar conclusions follow for the inverse tensor @xmath247 . for example , if we place @xmath256 into the first ` slot ' of @xmath247 , we recover the _ original _ vector @xmath257 , since its covariant components in the coordinate basis are @xmath258 , where in the last equality we have used the reciprocity relations ( [ hinverse ] ) .",
    "these components can also be written @xmath259 , and their contravariant counterparts as @xmath260 . in all these cases ,",
    "the components of @xmath247 have been used to convert a latin index into a greek one .",
    "one may also perform the reverse operation : consider , for example , the vector @xmath261 ; this has contravariant components in the tetrad basis given by @xmath262 , but these are _ not _ , in general , equal to @xmath263 .",
    "the index conversion properties of the components of @xmath245 and @xmath247 trivially extend to objects possessing multiple indices : for example , if @xmath264 is a rank-2 tensor field , then one obtains the _ new _",
    "rank-2 tensor field @xmath265 with covariant components ( say ) in the tetrad basis given by @xmath266 . using the reciprocity relations ( [ hinverse ] )",
    ", one may therefore also write , for example , @xmath267 . one may also , of course , convert just some subset of the indices on a higher - rank object , and each case corresponds to the components of a _ different _ object , referred to the corresponding combination of tetrad and coordinate basis vectors@xcite .",
    "the interpretation presented above contrasts sharply with the ( more commonly adopted ) geometric interpretation of wgt ( which we describe in detail in section  [ sec : geowgt ] ) , in which @xmath8 is identified as a vierbein that directly relates the coordinate basis vectors @xmath133 and local tetrad frame vectors @xmath268 ; in this case , the components @xmath269 , for example , are interpreted as the components @xmath270 of the _ original _ vector field @xmath249 in the local lorentz basis .",
    "moreover , in the minkowski spacetime gauge field interpretation , the rhs of ( [ dladef ] ) need _ not _ vanish , which should be contrasted with the usual ` tetrad postulate ' that applies in the geometric interpretation of wgt .",
    "the gauge field strengths in wgt are defined in the usual way in terms of the commutator of the covariant derivatives .",
    "considering first the @xmath196-covariant derivative , one finds @xmath271{\\varphi}= \\tfrac{1}{2}{r^{ab}}_{\\mu\\nu}\\sigma_{ab}{\\varphi}+ wh_{\\mu\\nu}{\\varphi } , \\label{dstarmucomm}\\ ] ] where we have defined the ` rotational ' and ` dilation ' field strength tensors of the gauge fields @xmath7 and @xmath81 , respectively , as @xmath272 both @xmath273 and @xmath274 transform covariantly under gct and local lorentz rotations in accordance with their respective index structures , and are invariant under local dilations ( i.e. each has weyl weight @xmath209 ) .    of greater relevance",
    ", however , is the commutator of two generalised covariant derivatives . since @xmath275 , this commutator differs from ( [ dstarmucomm ] ) by an additional term containing the derivatives of @xmath8 , and reads @xmath276{\\varphi}= \\tfrac{1}{2}{{\\cal r}^{ab}}_{cd}\\sigma_{ab}{\\varphi}+ w{\\cal h}_{cd}{\\varphi}- { { \\cal t^\\ast}^a}_{cd}{\\cal d}^\\ast_a{\\varphi } , \\label{weylfsdefs}\\ ] ] where @xmath277 and @xmath278 , and the ` translational ' field strength of the gauge field @xmath8 is given by @xmath279 which transforms covariantly under local lorentz transformations in accordance with its index structure .",
    "it is worth noting ( [ cstardef ] ) can also be written @xmath280 one may easily show that the translational field strength in wgt is related to the corresponding field strength @xmath281 in pgt ( see appendix  [ app : pgt ] ) , by @xmath282 where @xmath283 .",

    "it is clear that ( [ weyldiracaction ] ) has also inherited the invariance of the original dirac action ( [ diraclm3 ] ) under a global phase transformation .",
    "the first point to note is that , since both @xmath111 and @xmath380 have weyl weight @xmath381 , the dilation gauge field @xmath81 interacts in the same manner with each of them , thereby ruling out the interpretation of @xmath81 as the electromagnetic potential . moreover , rather curiously , @xmath81 vanishes completely from ( [ weyldiracaction ] ) .",
    "consequently , the wgt covariant derivative operator @xmath382 in the kinetic term in ( [ weyldiracaction ] ) can be replaced by its pgt counterpart @xmath383 , so that @xmath384 put another way , the kinetic term in the dirac action in pgt is _ already _ also invariant to local dilations .    to illustrate our general approach , however , for the moment we will consider the manifestly wgt - covariant form ( [ weyldiracaction ] ) of the lagrangian density .",
    "varying the corresponding action with respect to @xmath380 , one obtains a field equation of the form ( [ weylpeqn ] ) ( with @xmath0 replaced by @xmath380 ) , which is immediately found to read @xmath385 an equivalent adjoint field equation in @xmath380 is obtained by varying the action with respect to @xmath111 . since @xmath386 and @xmath387 transform covariantly under local dilations with weights @xmath388 and @xmath216 respectively , we see immediately that the lhs of ( [ weylcovardirac2 ] ) does indeed transform covariantly under local dilations with weight @xmath388 .",

    "the covariance of ( [ weylcovardirac ] ) is easily checked directly by recalling that @xmath390 and @xmath391 to recover ( [ weylcovardirac2 ] ) .",

    "consequently , all contractions of the spin - angular - momentum tensor vanish for dirac matter . as one might expect from the above discussion , ( [ diracemt ] ) may be rewritten in manifestly wgt - covariant form by simply making the replacement @xmath402 throughout ; the expression ( [ diracsam ] ) is already manifestly wgt covariant .",
    "finally , we note that one might also consider adding the following to the matter lagrangian density ( [ diracactionagain ] ) : kinetic and self - interaction terms for @xmath106 with weyl weight @xmath110 and , as discussed in sections  [ sec : lmwgt ] and [ sec : wgtfga ] , terms proportional to @xmath335 and @xmath344 , which directly couple @xmath106 non - minimally ( conformally ) to the gravitational gauge field strengths , where @xmath230 is given by ( [ lt2 ] ) , but with @xmath23 replaced by @xmath403 .",

    "it is worthwhile also considering the coupling of the electromagnetic field to the gravitational gauge fields , since this illustrates some important differences from the dirac field discussed above .",
    "the standard special - relativistic lagrangian for the electromagnetic field @xmath168 ( which should not be confused with the ` rotational ' gravitational gauge field @xmath7 ) is given by @xmath410 where the electromagnetic field strength tensor @xmath411 and @xmath171 is some source current density .",
    "we showed earlier that the action constructed from the lagrangian ( [ emlagwgt ] ) is invariant under global weyl transformations , provided @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "moreover , it is also invariant under the electromagnetic gauge transformation @xmath412 , where @xmath413 is any scalar field , provided the source current density satisfies the continuity equation @xmath414 , which embodies the conservation of charge .    unlike the dirac field , in this case the dynamical field @xmath168 carries a coordinate index .",
    "our first task , which was unnecessary for the dirac field , is therefore to convert this to a roman index by constructing the covariant field @xmath415 .",
    "similarly , we introduce the covariant current density @xmath416 .",
    "this leads us , however , to a subtle point . in the special relativistic case ( [ emlagwgt ] )",
    ", the field components can equally well refer to the cartesian coordinate basis @xmath133 or the local lorentz basis @xmath268 , which can be chosen to coincide . in principle , however , the field components should properly refer to the latter .",
    "thus , once the weyl transformation is localised , for consistency one requires the covariant fields to have the weyl weights @xmath417 and @xmath418 ; consequently , the fields carrying a greek index have weights @xmath419 and @xmath420 .",
    "following the general procedure for constructing a locally - weyl - invariant matter action ( [ weylmatlag_gen ] ) leads to the lagrangian density @xmath421 where we have defined @xmath422 . since @xmath423 , @xmath424 has an overall weyl weight of zero , as required .",
    "unfortunately , the lagrangian density ( [ emlagcovwgt ] ) is inappropriate for describing the coupling of the electromagnetic and gravitational gauge fields , since the corresponding action does not inherit the necessary invariance under electromagnetic gauge transformations .",
    "this is easily seen by noting that @xmath425 where we have defined @xmath426 , in which @xmath427 , and @xmath428 is the wgt field strength tensor of the @xmath41 gravitational gauge field , as defined in ( [ cstardef ] ) .",
    "it is apparent that @xmath429 does inherit the original electromagnetic gauge invariance of @xmath430 , whereas the second term on the rhs of ( [ fijhatstar ] ) is clearly not invariant under the electromagnetic gauge transformation , and so neither is @xmath431 .",
    "moreover , @xmath429 has a weyl weight @xmath432 .",

    "it is worth noting that this form for @xmath424 is identical to that obtained in pgt , as should be clear from the above discussion .",

    "the equation of motion for the electromagnetic field is given by @xmath435 , which is easily shown to be equivalent to @xmath436 , and in manifestly wgt - covariant form this reads @xmath437 it is worth noting that this equation does not have the generic form ( [ weylpeqn ] ) , owing to the term containing @xmath428 on the lhs .",
    "this additional term arises because the demands of electromagnetic gauge invariance of the action dictated the use of the lagrangian density ( [ emlagcov2wgt ] ) , rather than ( [ emlagcovwgt ] ) .",
    "had we ( erroneously ) used the latter , the resulting equation of motion would not have included this extra term , and would indeed have taken the general form ( [ weylpeqn ] ) .",

    "thus , substituting ( [ wgtcovderivalt ] ) into ( [ emeomwgtstar ] ) and ( [ emdiffidwgt ] ) , one may show straightforwardly that the electromagnetic field equation and bianchi identity become , respectively , @xmath442}= 0 .",

    "although not manifestly wgt - covariant , the equations ( [ empgtaltforms ] ) provide the simplest expression of the dynamics of the electromagnetic field for calculational purposes , and shows that the pgt torsion has no direct effect .    to complete the description of the electromagnetic field in wgt , we derive its energy - momentum and spin - angular - momentum tensors . setting @xmath444 in ( [ emlagcov2wgt ] )",

    "we see that @xmath447 is the natural generalisation of the standard energy - momentum tensor for the electromagnetic field in the absence of gravity .",

    "we note that the expression ( [ pgtememt ] ) is already manifestly wgt ( and pgt ) covariant .",
    "finally , one may straightforwardly include the interaction of the electromagnetic and dirac fields , both of which are coupled to gravity , by noting that the covariant current density of the dirac field is simply @xmath449 , which has the required weyl weight @xmath450 .",
    "thus , one simply makes this substitution into ( [ emlagcov2wgt ] ) and adds the result to ( [ weylcovardirac3 ] ) .      as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", one may use the scale gauge freedom to set the scalar field @xmath106 to a constant ( provided @xmath451 ) , which is known as the einstein gauge .",
    "although it is most common simply to set @xmath452 , this can be misleading and so we instead set @xmath453 , where @xmath454 is a constant with the same units as @xmath106 . adopting the einstein gauge can be viewed simply as a mathematical convenience , but it is often also given the physical interpretation of corresponding to some spontaneous breaking of the scale symmetry .",
    "indeed , it is usually considered that setting @xmath119 represents the choice of some definite scale in the theory , thereby breaking scale - invariance .",
    "the forms of the field equations in wgt , which we discussed in general in section  [ sec : wgtfieldeqns ] , can be simplified considerably by adopting the einstein gauge .",
    "there is , however , an alternative approach , which is not usually followed in the literature , where one recasts the theory in terms of scale - invariant field variables@xcite .",
    "we show here that , for _ any _ wgt lagrangian density of the form considered in ( [ wgtlagtot ] ) , this procedure yields equations of motion in the new field variables that are _ identical _ in form to those obtained after setting @xmath453 in the equations of motion for the original fields .",
    "this therefore provides a rather different interpretation of the einstein gauge than that traditionally assumed , since the approach using scale - invariant variables involves no breaking of the scale symmetry .",
    "indeed , one may regard adopting the einstein gauge merely as a shortcut to obtaining the forms of the equations of motion for the scale - invariant field variables .    to demonsrate this equivalence ,",
    "we begin by introducing the new matter and gravitational gauge fields    [ wgtsivardef ] @xmath455    where @xmath122 is the weyl weight of the original matter field @xmath0 .",

    "one begins by noting that @xmath477 , since @xmath338 does not depend on @xmath106 or its derivative . as discussed in section  [ sec : wgtconslaws ] , the invariance of the matter action @xmath372 under local dilations leads to the wgt conservation law ( [ wgtlmcons3 ] ) , which may be straightforwardly rewritten as @xmath478 where we have made use of the @xmath0-field equation @xmath479 and set @xmath119 in the resulting expression . turning now to the expression ( [ wgtlagtotsi ] ) for @xmath347 in terms of scale - invariant variables and applying the chain rule for partial derivatives ,",

    "since @xmath434 does not depend on the derivatives of @xmath468 , one may replace @xmath481 by @xmath482 in the above equation .",
    "then , comparing ( [ phieqnorigvar ] ) and ( [ phieqnsivar ] ) and making use of our earlier observations regarding the other field equations , one sees that the @xmath106-field equation written in terms of the scale - invariant variables also has the _ same _ functional form as the @xmath106-field equation in terms of the original variables with @xmath119 .    for the remainder of our discussion",
    ", we will continue to use the original field variables for the most part , and occasionally simplify field equations by adopting the einstein gauge @xmath453 , since this approach is more familiar and straightforward .",
    "nonetheless , the equivalence of the results so obtained with those expressed in terms of scale - invariant variables should be borne in mind throughout .",
    "we may determine the equation of motion of a massive matter test particle in wgt from the dirac lagrangian ( [ diraclm2 ] ) , but modified to accommodate local scale - invariance by simply introducing the massless scalar field @xmath106 and making the replacement @xmath483 , as in ( [ diraclm3 ] ) .",
    "one begins by constructing the appropriate action for a spin-@xmath484 point particle , and then makes the full classical approximation in which the particle spin is neglected .",
    "this procedure is outlined for a free particle in appendix  [ appendix : dirac ] . to include gravitational effects in the point particle action ( [ pointparticleaction ] )",

    "it is straightforward to show that ( [ wgtpppdot ] ) can be written in a manifestly wgt - covariant manner as @xmath499 at first sight , ( [ wgtppeom1a ] ) appears to show that ` torsion ' enters the particle equation of motion directly . as one might suspect from our discussion in sections",
    "[ sec : wgtdirac ] and [ sec : wgtem ] , however , appearances can be deceptive .",

    "if one uses local scale invariance to impose the einstein gauge @xmath119 ( a constant ) , then ( [ wgtppeom2 ] ) reduces to @xmath507 when reinterpreted geometrically ( see section  [ sec : geowgt ] and appendix  [ app : pgt ] ) , the quantities @xmath508 appearing in @xmath509 contain the same geometrical information as the metric connection .",
    "thus , ( [ wgtppeomfinal ] ) describes the gauge theory equivalent of _ geodesic _ motion ( as opposed , for example , to motion along autoparallels , which would correspond to the equation of motion @xmath510 ) .",
    "we note that this conclusion differs from some previous studies@xcite , in which the wgt conservation laws applied to the energy momentum tensor of dust yield an equation of motion for a matter test particle that contains an additional electromagnetic - like lorentz force term proportional to @xmath511 , where @xmath512 is the particle s weyl charge and @xmath157 is its mass .",

    "it is feasible that by constructing a point particle action based instead upon ( say ) the action for a scalar field , which does depend on the dilation gauge field , one would arrive at an equation of motion that does contain the lorentz - force term above .",
    "we do not consider this further here , however , since in our opinion ` normal ' matter is more appropriately described by dirac particles .    by setting @xmath513 in the action ( [ wgtppaction ] ) and choosing the einbein @xmath514 , such that @xmath515 , one finds that the equation of motion in the massless case ( for example , a massless neutrino ) is again given by ( [ wgtppeomfinal ] ) , even without imposing the einstein gauge .",
    "one may also arrive at a similar conclusion for the motion of photons by directly considering the dynamics of the electromagnetic field . as discussed in section  [ sec : wgtem ] , the em field tensor in wgt again satisfies the field equation and bianchi identity given in ( [ empgtaltforms ] ) , which have precisely the same form as those obtained in the absence of torsion .",
    "consequently , one may immediately infer that the equation of motion for photons is also given by ( [ wgtppeomfinal ] ) , so that they too follow the gauge theory equivalent of _ geodesic _ motion .",
    "it is worth noting that the lack of a lorentz - force term is again related to the absence of the dilation gauge field @xmath81 from the wgt action for the electromagnetic field .    to deduce the geodesic equation of motion ( [ wgtppeomfinal ] ) , it was necessary to impose the einstein gauge condition @xmath119 . as one might suspect from our discussion in the previous section , however ,",
    "this is unnecessary and an equivalent result may be obtained directly in terms of scale - invariant variables , as we now demonstrate .",

    "the conservation laws in reduced wgt do have the same form as those given in section  [ sec : wgtconslaws ] for wgt , but with the replacements @xmath539 , @xmath551 and @xmath552 .",
    "furthermore , by performing analogous calculations to those presented in sections  [ sec : wgteinstein ] and [ sec : wgtmassivemotion ] , respectively , one may show that our conclusions in wgt regarding the interpretation of the einstein gauge and the motion of test particles also apply in reduced wgt .    finally , as alluded to above , it is important to distinguish reduced wgt , in which the condition of vanishing wgt torsion is imposed directly at the level of the action , from instead setting the ( properly wgt - covariant ) condition @xmath553 in the field equations of wgt . in the latter case , the notion of the reduced covariant derivative operator @xmath531 in ( [ dstarmuzerodef ] ) is still useful , as we have seen in sections  [ sec : wgtdirac ] , [ sec : wgtem ] and [ sec : wgtmassivemotion ] , but the basic field equations remain linear in second - order derivatives of the gauge fields ; although one can substitute for the rotational gauge field to obtain equations that contain higher - order derviatives , the theory does not suffer from ostrogradsky s instability .",
    "in essence , the two approaches correspond to ` second - order ' and ` first - order ' variational formalisms , respectively .",
    "indeed , they are analogous to the metric and palatini variations used in the study of geometric theories of modified gravity , where in the latter method the metric ( levi  civita ) connection is subsequently imposed in the resulting field equations ; the two methods yield the same ( second - order ) field equations only for the lovelock action@xcite , which coincides with the einstein ",
    "hilbert action ( plus a cosmological constant term ) in @xmath554 dimensions .",
    "so far , we have been firm in our resolve to regard @xmath8 , @xmath7 and @xmath81 purely as gauge fields in minkowski spacetime , and have avoided attaching any geometric interpretation to them .",
    "although we will maintain this viewpoint in this paper , it is nonetheless common practice to reinterpret wgt in geometric terms , and we therefore give a brief account of this reinterpretation here .    at the heart of the geometric interpretation of wgt ( and pgt ) is the identification of @xmath8 as the components of a vierbein system in a more general spacetime .",
    "thus , at any point @xmath180 in the spacetime , one demands that the orthonormal tetrad frame vectors @xmath183 and the coordinate frame vectors @xmath138 are related by@xcite @xmath555 with similar relationships holding between the dual basis vectors @xmath556 and @xmath557 in each set . for any other vector @xmath249 , written in the coordinate basis as ( say ) @xmath558 ,",
    "one then identifies the quantities @xmath559 , for example , as the components of the _ same _ vector , but in the tetrad basis .",
    "this is a fundamental difference from the minkowski spacetime viewpoint presented earlier , in which @xmath560 would be regarded as the components in the tetrad basis of a _ new _ vector field @xmath561 .",
    "the identification of @xmath8 as the components of a vierbein system has a number of far - reaching consequences .",
    "firstly , the index - conversion properties of @xmath8 and @xmath40 are extended .",
    "it is straightforward to show , for example , that @xmath562 and @xmath563 .",
    "moreover , any contraction over latin ( greek ) indices can be replaced by one over greek ( latin ) indices .",
    "none of these operations is admissible when the @xmath41 and @xmath49 fields are viewed purely as gauge fields in minkowski spacetime .",
    "perhaps the most important consequence of identifying @xmath8 as the components of a vierbein system is that the inner product of the coordinate basis vectors becomes @xmath564 thus , in this geometric interpretation , one must work in a more general spacetime with metric @xmath565 .",
    "conversely , since the tetrad basis vectors still form an orthonormal set , one has @xmath566 from ( [ metricdef ] ) , one also finds that @xmath567 ( where we are working with a metric signature of @xmath568 ) . under a ( local , physical ) dilation ,",
    "the spacetime metric and @xmath41-field have weyl weights @xmath569 and @xmath570 respectively , and so ( [ metricdef ] ) and ( [ etagdef ] ) imply that @xmath571 , as expected . from ( [ geotetrad])([etagdef ] ) , one immediately finds that the @xmath41-field and its inverse are directly related by index raising / lowering , so there no need to distinguish between them by using different kernel letters .",
    "consequently , the standard practice , which we will follow here , is to notate @xmath8 and @xmath40 as @xmath572 and @xmath573 , respectively .",
    "one is also led naturally to the interpretation of @xmath7 as the components of the ` spin - connection ' that encodes the rotation of the local tetrad frame between points @xmath180 and @xmath574 , which is accompanied by a local change in the standard of length between the two points , which is encoded by @xmath81 .",
    "thus , the operation of parallel transport for some vector @xmath575 of weight @xmath122 is defined as @xmath576 which is required to compare vectors @xmath577 and @xmath578 at points @xmath180 and @xmath574 , determined with respect to the tetrad frames @xmath183 and @xmath579 respectively .",
    "hence , in general , a vector not only changes its direction on parallel transport around a closed loop , but also its length .",
    "the expression ( [ weylparallel ] ) establishes the correct form for the related @xmath196-covariant derivative , e.g. @xmath580 where we have used the partial derivative operator @xmath581 defined in ( [ dstardef ] ) .",
    "moreover , the existence of tetrad frames at each point of the spacetime implies the existence of the lorentz metric @xmath582 at each point . then demanding that @xmath582 is invariant under parallel transport , and recalling that @xmath571 , requires the spin - connection to be antisymmetric , i.e. @xmath204 , as previously .",
    "substantial differences between the minkowski spacetime gauge field viewpoint and the geometric interpretation do occur , however , when generalising the @xmath196-covariant derivative to apply to fields with definite gct tensor behaviour .",
    "first , in the geometric interpretation , one can in general no longer construct a global inertial cartesian coordinate system in the more general spacetime .",
    "thus , one must rely on arbitrary coordinates and so define the ` total ' covariant derivative @xmath583 where @xmath584 and @xmath238 are the @xmath239 generator matrices appropriate to the gct tensor character of the field to which @xmath585 is applied . if a field @xmath111 carries only latin indices , then @xmath586 and so @xmath587 ; conversely , if a field @xmath111 carries only greek indices , then @xmath588 and so @xmath589 .",

    "this is discussed further in appendix  [ app : pgt ] , in the context of pgt .",
    "we now consider a novel alternative to standard weyl gauge theory , which has a number of interesting features .",
    "recall that , in sections  [ sec : wgtdirac ] and [ sec : wgtem ] respectively , we showed that the pgt matter actions for the ( massless ) dirac field and the electromagnetic field are already invariant under local dilations ( and are , indeed , identical to their wgt counterparts ) , provided the gravitational gauge fields @xmath8 and @xmath7 transform under local weyl transformations as ( [ weylhtrans ] ) and ( [ atrans ] ) , respectively .",
    "considering just the local dilation part of the transformation@xcite , for the fields @xmath8 and @xmath7 one has @xmath635 showing that they transform covariantly with weights @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively ( where we have temporarily reinstated the explicit notational dependence of the fields on spacetime position @xmath180 ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show , however , that the dirac and electromagnetic field actions in pgt ( and wgt ) remain invariant under local dilations , even if one assumes a more general ` extended ' transformation law for the @xmath49-field , whilst still retaining the original @xmath41-field transformation law , such that ( [ weylhtrans2 ] ) and ( [ weylatrans2 ] ) are replaced by @xmath636 where @xmath637 , @xmath638 and @xmath639 is an arbitrary parameter that can take any value@xcite . moreover , under a global scale transformation , the ` extended ' transformation laws ( [ eweylhtrans2 ] ) and ( [ eweylatrans ] ) for the @xmath41 and @xmath49 fields reduce to the same form as the ` normal ' ones ( [ weylhtrans2 ] ) and ( [ weylatrans2 ] ) , and may be considered as an equally valid gauging of global scale invariance .",
    "these observations provide compelling motivation for exploring the properties of the gauge theory of local weyl transformations in which the @xmath41 and @xmath49 fields obey the transformations ( [ eweylhtrans2 ] ) and ( [ eweylatrans ] ) under local dilations ; we call this extended weyl gauge theory ( ewgt ) .",
    "a complementary motivation for exploring ewgt is that the ` extended ' transformation laws ( [ eweylhtrans2 ] ) and ( [ eweylatrans ] ) lead to transformation properties for the pgt curvature @xmath22 and torsion @xmath23 that are on a more equal footing with one another than those that result from the standard wgt transformations laws ( [ weylhtrans2 ] ) and ( [ weylatrans2 ] ) . under the latter set of transformations , @xmath22 and @xmath23 behave in very different ways .",

    "indeed , the transformations ( [ weylhtrans2 ] ) and ( [ weylatrans2 ] ) have the consequence of inducing pgt torsion .",
    "considering the case where the @xmath41-field originally has vanishing pgt torsion @xmath644 , the inhomogeneous nature of the transformation law ( [ eqn : tortrans ] ) means that the local dilation leads to @xmath645 .    assuming the ` extended ' transformation laws ( [ eweylhtrans2 ] ) and ( [ eweylatrans ] ) , however , the pgt curvature and torsion transform under local dilations as    @xmath646 } - 2\\theta\\delta^{[a}_c({\\cal d}_d-\\theta{\\cal p}_d){\\cal p}^{b ] } - 2\\theta{\\cal p}^{[a}{{\\cal t}^{b]}}_{cd } - 2\\theta^2\\delta^{[a}_c\\delta^{b]}_d { \\cal p}^e { \\cal p}_e \\ } , \\label{rspecialt } \\\\ { { \\cal t}^{\\prime a}}_{bc } & = & e^{-\\rho}\\{{{\\cal t}^a}_{bc}+2(1-\\theta){\\cal    p}_{[b}\\delta_{c]}^a\\}.\\label{eqn : tortransgeneral}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , for general values of @xmath639 , neither @xmath97 nor @xmath647 transforms covariantly , but for @xmath648 one recovers the ` normal ' transformation law ( [ weylatrans2 ] ) for the @xmath49-field , which results in a covariant transformation law for the pgt curvature under local dilations , whereas for @xmath649 one obtains the ` special ' transformation law for the @xmath49-field , @xmath650 which leads to a covariant transformation law with weight @xmath216 for the pgt torsion . by considering the ` extended ' @xmath49-field transformation law ( [ eweylatrans ] ) , one can therefore accommodate both cases in a balanced manner .",

    "it is important to note that the covariant derivative ( [ ewgtcovdiv ] ) does not explicitly contain the parameter @xmath639 .",
    "consequently , it does _ not _ reduce to the standard wgt covariant derivative @xmath667 ( with @xmath81 replaced by @xmath654 ) in the case @xmath648 , in which one recovers the ` normal ' local weyl transformations .",
    "indeed , in this case , one sees from ( [ eqn : vtransform ] ) that one can covariantly set @xmath668 , so that @xmath669 and the covariant derivative ( [ ewgtcovdiv ] ) may be written simply as @xmath670 , in which the role played by the usual dilation gauge field @xmath81 in wgt has been taken up instead by the trace of the pgt torsion ; such a replacement has been discussed previously@xcite .",

    ", we define a generalised covariant derivative @xmath676 which transforms covariantly with weight @xmath677 , as desired .",
    "having achieved our aim of constructing an appropriate covariant derivative , we can now straightforwardly convert a matter action invariant under global weyl transformations into one that is invariant under extended local weyl transformations , which is given by @xmath678 once again , it is convenient to denote the integrand of the action by the lagrangian density @xmath679 .",
    "we note that the gravitational gauge fields @xmath41 , @xmath49 and @xmath666 in ewgt contain a total of 44 independent variables , as in wgt . as was the case in wgt , ( [ eweylmatlag_gen ] )",

    "in particular , terms proportional to @xmath680 or @xmath681 are extended weyl - covariant with weight @xmath110 and so may be added to @xmath84 .      before continuing with the formal development of ewgt",
    ", it is worth commenting briefly on the relationship of our approach to others in the literature . in particular , by introducing the modified @xmath49-field in ( [ adaggerdef ] ) , one might ask whether the modified transformation law in ( [ eweylatrans ] ) corresponds to some ` deformation ' of the action of the weyl group , which underlies the physical symmetries we are assuming .",
    "indeed , it might seem that such a deformation does occur if one takes the view that specifying the group action leads uniquely to a given set of gauge fields and transformation laws ; in some approaches these do follow directly from the structure constants of the associated lie group .",
    "there have , for example , been several attempts in the literature to carry out local gauging not just for the weyl group , but for the full conformal group , i.e.  with special conformal translations included as well as rotations , translations and dilations . an early approach to this by kaku et",
    "al.@xcite considers the representation of the full conformal group @xmath682 via the @xmath683 dirac matrix algebra of @xmath684 , to which @xmath682 is locally isomorphic . in this approach",
    ", the structure constants of the group to be locally gauged feed through via the maurer  cartan equations to give the ` curvatures ' corresponding to the different group elements .",
    "these equations are therefore fixed by the initial group structure .",
    "of course , such a method is very different to that which we carry out here .",
    "we emphasise in particular that after the decoupling of the translation and dilational parts of the transformation described at the start of section  [ sec : lmwgt ] , the form of scaling we describe here corresponds to ` weyl scaling ' , as discussed , for example , in section  2.2 of blagojevic@xcite . in this case , all fields are rescaled according to their weyl weight , but without any accompanying coordinate changes .",
    "this is still exactly the symmetry for which we are providing a local gauging via our modified @xmath49-field ( [ adaggerdef ] ) , and modified transformation laws ( [ eweylatrans ] ) , and thus no ` deformation ' has taken place of the underlying symmetry .",
    "in particular the associated group is still ` weyl scaling ' , despite the changes in the implementation of it .",
    "it would , however , still be of interest to attempt to relate the proposed new transformations and extended @xmath49-field found here with attempts at full conformal gauging , such as carried out by kaku et al .",
    ", since some intriguing relationships between the two approaches do exist . in particular , both kaku et al .",
    ", and later wheeler@xcite , find that the gauge field corresponding to special conformal transformations , which in their approaches is an additional ` vierbein - like ' field similar to the field corresponding to translations , does not propagate , and can be eliminated via its equations of motion . this leaves a version of ` weyl scaling ' as the only further symmetry remaining in addition to translational and rotational symmetries .",
    "the interest for our approach lies in the fact that , during the gauging process , additional components of the spin connection are found that are of similar form to the new piece of the @xmath49-field we are proposing .",
    "an explicit example of this can be seen in equation ( 6 ) of kaku et al . ,",
    "in which a piece @xmath685 is added to the spin connection @xmath686 ( their @xmath317-field is the ` dilatation field ' , which in our case corresponds to @xmath687 , while their @xmath688 is a version of either our @xmath41-field or its inverse ; it is difficult to make an exact correspondence due to the very different way the translation gauge field is treated between their approach and ours . )    furthermore , one of the problems of gauging the conformal group , which the kaku et al .",
    "approach is trying to overcome , lies in the fact that the global group generators in a coordinate representation involve a naked 4d position vector , @xmath130 , and a local equivalent of this does not exist .",
    "however , if we nevertheless examine global conformal transformations , then section  4.1 of blagojevic@xcite shows how variation under these leads to a modified lorentz spin connection containing an extra term of the form @xmath689 , where here @xmath690 is the extra ` vierbein - type ' field corresponding to the special conformal transformations . here",
    "@xmath691 is a global surrogate for @xmath692 ( noting the fact that the generator of global dilations is @xmath693 ) , and so this is again suggestive that our proposed additional term in the lorentz spin connection given in ( [ adaggerdef ] ) , and the modified transformation laws ( [ eweylatrans ] ) ( involving an arbitrary new parameter @xmath639 , which in the end does not appear in the covariant derivative itself ) , may be linked with the symmetries of the full conformal group , and may even provide a new route through to its successful gauging .",
    "we leave this topic to future research , however , and now continue with our development of ewgt .",
    "the comments made in section  [ sec : minkintwgt ] also hold in ewgt , in particular the freedom to choose global inertial cartesian coordinates in the minkowski spacetime and , if required , the way in which the covariant derivative can be extended to act on quantities with a definite tensor behaviour under gct .",
    "in particular , the @xmath196-covariant derivative in ( [ ewgtcovdiv ] ) becomes @xmath694 where @xmath695 , @xmath237 is the metric connection corresponding to the ( flat - space ) metric @xmath193 defined by the coordinate system , and @xmath238 are the @xmath239 generator matrices appropriate to the gct tensor character of the field to which @xmath696 is applied , and @xmath122 is its weyl weight .      as in wgt",

    "following our general procedure for constructing a matter action ( [ eweylmatlag_gen ] ) that is invariant under extended weyl transformations and applying it to ( [ diraclm3 ] ) , the appropriate form for the corresponding lagrangian density is @xmath821 which is simply the wgt lagrangian density ( [ weyldiracaction ] ) , but with @xmath822 .",
    "similar to wgt , since both @xmath111 and @xmath380 have weyl weight @xmath381 , the dilation gauge field @xmath654 interacts in the same manner with each of them , thereby ruling out the interpretation of @xmath654 as the electromagnetic potential .",
    "moreover , @xmath654 similarly vanishes completely from the action ( [ eweyldiracaction ] ) .",
    "thus , as occurred in wgt , ( [ eweyldiracaction ] ) is identical to the covariant dirac lagrangian in pgt , given in ( [ diracactionagain ] ) .",

    "nonetheless , unlike in wgt , one must note that the presence of torsion ( even in the case @xmath829}=0 $ ] ) will still induce physical effects on @xmath111 , since the pgt torsion enters into the definition of @xmath750 on which depend the gravitational field equations that determine the @xmath41 and @xmath205 fields .",

    "hence , we base our massive dirac field matter lagrangian on ( [ weylcovardirac3 ] ) , but appropriately generalised to be ewgt covariant . thus ,",

    "it is worth noting that @xmath117 has the dimensions of mass in natural units .",
    "the dynamics of the electromagnetic field in ewgt follow by direct analogy from our discussion in section  [ sec : wgtem ] in the context of wgt , with the replacements @xmath837 , @xmath838 and @xmath839 , and recalling that @xmath840 .",
    "thus , as in wgt ( and pgt ) , one arrives at the conclusion that the appropriate lagrangian density for the em field is given by ( [ emlagcov2wgt ] ) , namely @xmath841 which has an overall weyl weight of zero , as required , provided @xmath418 . hence , the electromagnetic lagrangian in pgt is _ already _ covariant under extended local dilations , which again was one of our original motivations for exploring ewgt .",
    "since the lagrangian ( [ emlagcov2ewgt ] ) is identical to that in pgt , then the equation of motion for the electromagnetic field is again given by ( [ emeomwgt ] ) , which may be straightforwardly recast as @xmath842 which is manifestly ewgt covariant .",
    "one should note that this differs slightly from the corresponding form ( [ emeomwgtstar ] ) in wgt , since @xmath840 .",
    "also , the differential identity ( [ emdiffid ] ) satisfied by the electromagnetic field strength tensor may also directly be shown to be covariant under local dilations , since it can be easily rewritten as @xmath843 } -{{\\cal t}^{\\dagger d}}_{[ab}{\\cal f}_{c]d}= 0 .",
    "\\label{ewgtembi}\\ ] ] since ( [ emeomwgt ] ) and ( [ emdiffid ] ) also hold in ewgt , then so too do the alternative forms given in ( [ empgtaltforms ] ) in terms of the reduced covariant derivative in pgt , which show that the pgt torsion plays no explicit role in the dynamics of the electromagnetic field .",
    "one may also rewrite ( [ empgtaltforms ] ) in terms of the reduced ewgt covariant derivative , and one finds that ( [ empgtaltforms ] ) is again satisfied , but with the replacement @xmath830 .",
    "thus the ewgt torsion similarly has no direct effect of the em field dynamics .",
    "as mentioned above for the dirac field , however , the presence of torsion will still induce physical effects ( unlike in wgt ) , since the reduced covariant derivative @xmath844 depends on the gauge fields , which are determined by gravitational field equations ; these , in turn , depend on the ` curvative ' tensor @xmath750 or its contractions , which contain the torsion .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor @xmath447 of the em field has the same form as in pgt and wgt , namely that given in ( [ pgtememt ] ) , which is already manifestly ewgt covariant .",
    "indeed , from ( [ covemtdef ] ) , one sees immediately that @xmath845 , since the em field spin - angular - momentum tensor @xmath831 vanishes .",
    "finally , one may straightforwardly include the interaction of the electromagnetic and dirac fields , both of which are coupled to gravity , in the same way as in wgt , as discussed in section  [ sec : wgtem ] .",
    "as was the case for wgt , the forms of the field equations in ewgt can be simplified considerably by using the scale gauge freedom to impose the einstein gauge , in which the scalar field is set to a constant everywhere , @xmath119 ( provided @xmath106 does not vanish ) . moreover , as occurred for wgt ( see section  [ sec : wgteinstein ] ) , we show here that the resulting field equations are _ identical _ in form to those obtained when working in terms of a new set of scale - invariant field variables .",
    "thus , this again provides an alternative interpretation of the einstein gauge , since the approach using scale - invariant variables involves no breaking of the scale symmetry .",
    "it is convenient to work in terms of the alternative set of field variables @xmath0 , @xmath106 , @xmath58 and @xmath657 discussed in section  [ sec : ewgtaltvarp ] , in which the total lagrangian density @xmath347 does not depend explicitly on the dilational gauge field @xmath654 or its derivatives .",
    "we begin by introducing the new scale - invariant matter field and gravitational gauge fields @xmath846 where @xmath122 is the weyl weight of the original matter field @xmath0 .",
    "it is also convenient to define the further scale - invariant variables @xmath847 .    as shown in section  [ sec : ewgtaltvarp ] , the ewgt covariant derivative of some general field @xmath413 with weyl weight @xmath122 can be written in the form @xmath848 , where @xmath849 and @xmath850 are defined in ( [ dnatdefagain ] ) and ( [ tnatdef ] ) , respectively . in an analogous manner , we may define the quantities @xmath851 and @xmath852 , for which each occurrence of @xmath8 and @xmath657 in ( [ dnatdef ] ) and ( [ tnatdef ] ) is replaced by its scale - invariant counterpart @xmath527 and @xmath853 , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath854 and a short calculation shows that @xmath852 transforms covariantly with weyl weight @xmath209 under local dilations , i.e.  it is scale - invariant .",
    "one then immediately finds that the ewgt covariant derivative of the scalar field @xmath106 may be written as @xmath855 , whereas the covariant derivative of some general field @xmath413 with weyl weight @xmath122 may be written @xmath856 where @xmath460 and we have defined the derivative operator @xmath857 , which preserves the weyl weight of the quantity on which it acts . from ( [ ewgtscaleinvdiff ] ) , one sees that , aside from the overall multiplicative factor @xmath463 , the scale - invariant quantity @xmath858 has the _ same _ functional dependency on @xmath465 , @xmath466 , and @xmath853 , respectively , as @xmath859 does on @xmath413 , @xmath8 and @xmath657 .",
    "similarly , one also quickly finds that the ewgt gauge field strengths defined in ( [ weylfsdefs ] ) may be written as @xmath860 , @xmath861 and @xmath862 , where each quantity with a caret is scale - invariant and has the _ same _ functional dependence on @xmath466 and @xmath853 as the corresponding original quantity does on @xmath8 and @xmath657 , respectively .",
    "thus , noting that @xmath473 , one is led to the important conclusion , analogous to that discussed in section  [ sec : wgteinstein ] for wgt , that the lagrangian density @xmath347 in ( [ ewgtlagtdag ] ) may be written as ( suppressing indices for brevity ) @xmath863 specifically , when written in terms of the scale - invariant field variables , the lagrangian density @xmath347 ( indeed each term separately ) has the _ same _ functional form as it does in terms of the original variables with @xmath119 .",
    "thus , if @xmath413 represents @xmath0 , @xmath8 , or @xmath657 , one may immediately conclude that ( each term in ) the equation of motion @xmath475 has the _ same _ functional form as ( the corresponding term in ) @xmath476 , but with @xmath0 , @xmath8 and @xmath657 replaced by their scale - invariant counterparts ( [ ewgtsivarsdef ] ) .    as mentioned in section  [ sec : ewgtaltvarp ] , the equations of motion for the @xmath0 , @xmath41 and @xmath49 ( or @xmath807 ) fields are the only three _",
    "independent _ field equations of ewgt .",

    "it is worth mentioning that one may arrive at similar conclusions to those reached above , if one instead begins by working in terms of the ` standard ' set of field variables @xmath0 , @xmath106 , @xmath58 , @xmath7 and @xmath654 , rather than the alternative set introduced in section  [ sec : ewgtaltvarp ] . in this case , in place of ( [ ewgtsivarsdef ] ) , one introduces the scale - invariant matter field and gravitational gauge fields    [ ewgtsivarsdef2all ] @xmath864    where it is clear from the last definition that @xmath865 .",
    "it is also convenient to define the further scale - invariant variables @xmath866 and @xmath867 .",
    "the situation is , however , slightly different to that outlined above .",
    "specifically , the equations of motion in terms of @xmath0 , @xmath58 , @xmath7 and @xmath654 arrived at by adopting the einstein gauge , must first be rewritten in terms of @xmath0 , @xmath58 and the combinations @xmath657 and @xmath868 ( which will always be possible ) .",
    "only then will they be identical in form to the full field equations written in terms of the scale - invariant variables @xmath869 , @xmath466 , @xmath870 and @xmath871 , respectively .",
    "[ sec : ewgtmassivemotion ]    to determine the equation of motion of a massive test particle in ewgt , we follow the procedure outlined in section  [ sec : wgtmassivemotion ] for wgt , but modify it to accommodate extended local scale - invariance .",
    "thus , we again adopt the fully classical point particle action ( [ wgtppaction ] ) , in which the weyl weights of the dynamical variables , namely the particle 4-momentum @xmath489 , 4-velocity @xmath490 and the einbein @xmath491 along the worldline parameterised by @xmath406 , are the same as in wgt , so that the action is scale - invariant .",
    "varying the action ( [ wgtppaction ] ) with respect to the three dynamical variables , respectively , one again obtains the equations of motion ( [ wgtppeom1])([wgtppeom3 ] ) . in this case , however , it is straightforward to show that ( [ wgtpppdot ] ) can be written in a manifestly ewgt - covariant manner as @xmath872 .",
    "by analogy with our treatment in wgt , one may rewrite this equation in terms of the reduced ewgt covariant derivative , defined in ( [ ddaggermuzerodef ] ) , as @xmath873 , which is again manifestly ewgt - covariant . as in wgt",

    "precisely as in wgt , if one uses local scale invariance to impose the einstein gauge @xmath119 ( a constant ) , then ( [ wgtppeom2 ] ) reduces to same result as that given in ( [ wgtppeomfinal ] ) for wgt , which again describes the gauge theory equivalent of _ geodesic _ motion . unlike in wgt , however , the presence of pgt torsion may still induce physical effects , since the @xmath41 and @xmath205 fields are determined by gravitational field equations that depend on the ` curvature ' tensor @xmath750 , into which the pgt torsion enters .    as in wgt , by setting @xmath513 in the action ( [ wgtppaction ] ) and choosing the einbein @xmath514 , such that @xmath515 , one finds that the equation of motion in the massless case ( for example , a massless neutrino ) is also given by ( [ wgtppeomfinal ] ) , even without imposing the einstein gauge .",
    "one may also arrive at a similar conclusion for the motion of photons by directly considering the dynamics of the electromagnetic field . as discussed in section  [ sec : ewgtem ] , the em field tensor in ewgt again satisfies the field equation and bianchi identity given in ( [ empgtaltforms ] ) , which have precisely the same form as those obtained in the absence of torsion .",
    "consequently , one may immediately infer that the equation of motion for photons is also given by ( [ wgtppeomfinal ] ) , so that they too follow the gauge theory equivalent of _ geodesic _ motion .",
    "finally , as in wgt , the imposition of the einstein gauge is not necessary to arrive at the geodesic equation of motion ( [ wgtppeomfinal ] ) .",
    "one may again introduce the set of scale - invariant variables ( [ wgtppsivardef ] ) and rewrite the action ( [ wgtppaction ] ) in the form ( [ wgtppactionsi ] ) .",
    "thus , one arrives once more at the geodesic equation of motion ( [ wgtppeomfinalsi ] ) , which is written entirely in terms of scale - invariant variables .      in section  [ sec : ewgtaltcovd ] , we introduced the ` reduced ' ewgt covariant derivative operator @xmath875 in ( [ ddaggermuzerodef ] ) , to which the ` full ' ewgt covariant derivative ( [ ewgtcovdiv ] ) reduces in the case that the ewgt torsion @xmath747 vanishes ( which is a properly ewgt - covariant condition ) . in the context of ewgt ,",

    "as one might expect , the bianchi identities satisfied by the reduced field strength tensors are identical to those given in section  [ sec : ewgtbianchi ] , but with the replacements @xmath886 , @xmath887 and @xmath888 .    since the ` full ' generalised covariant derivative is given in terms of the ` reduced ' one by ( [ ewgtcovderivalt ] )",
    ", it follows that the field strength tensor @xmath713 appearing in ( [ ewgtdacomm ] ) , and its contractions , may be written in the forms ( [ riemann0])([randr0 ] ) , but with the replacements on the rhs @xmath889 , @xmath890 , @xmath891 and @xmath892 , and recalling that @xmath893 .    for reduced ewgt , the free gravitational lagrangian density @xmath544 , where by analogy with ( [ ewgtgravlagdef ] ) , @xmath894 which is based on ( [ lg2 ] ) with @xmath895 and @xmath896 .",

    "specifically , one finds the terms containing third- or fourth - order derivatives correspond to the derivative of already known expressions , and so contain no new information .",
    "moreover , on linearising the set of field equations displayed above , which we will also discuss in a forthcoming publication , we find that the same behaviour occurs generally , independent of any application of the theory to a particular physical system . since the leading order of the field equations is preserved by linearisation , this suggests that the full non - linear set of field equations derived above should also enjoy this general property and hence not suffer from ostrogradsky s instability , although we do not yet have a direct proof in this case .",
    "consequently , we have chosen to retain the terms resulting from the inclusion of the @xmath907 in the field equations given above , so that they are readily available if required .",
    "the obvious alternative approach to ensuring that ostrogradsky s instability does not occur is simply to omit the term proportional to @xmath907 from the free gravitational lagrangian ( by setting @xmath1001 ) .",
    "indeed , one can argue that the inclusion of the @xmath907 term as the kinetic term for the @xmath666 gauge field is not well motivated .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : ewgtaltvarp ] , ewgts of the general form considered here can be written entirely in terms of the two combinations @xmath41 and @xmath807 of the gauge fields , such that there is _ no _ explicit dependence on the dilation gauge field @xmath666 or its derivatives .",
    "moreover , the natural field strength tensors for the @xmath41 and @xmath807 fields are @xmath747 and @xmath746 , respectively , and the total lagrangian already contains all possible ( parity - invariant ) terms quadratic in these field strengths _ without _ including the @xmath812 term . the field equations in the special case @xmath1001 still display a rich phenomenology , and there is already a good deal to be explored in them .",
    "in particular , we note that in this case the linearisation process mentioned above reveals the further desirable property that one can obtain a second - order equation in @xmath666 alone , which can then be used to solve for @xmath49 alone and thence for the @xmath41 function alone , with sensible boundary conditions being available at each stage .",
    "thus , in this case , the theory is inherently fully solvable .",
    "these issues will be discussed fully in a forthcoming paper .      as discussed in section  [ sec : ewgteinstein ] , the field equations can be simplified considerably by adopting the einstein gauge , provided @xmath1002 . to obtain the corresponding forms of the field equations , one merely sets @xmath119 and makes the replacement @xmath1003 throughout , but we will not carry out this procedure explicitly here . as we showed earlier , however , if the resulting field equations are written in terms of @xmath0 , @xmath58 and the combinations @xmath657 and @xmath868 ( which will always be possible ) , they will be identical in form to the full field equations above expressed in terms of the scale - invariant variables @xmath869 , @xmath466 , @xmath1004 and @xmath871 , respectively , so that there is no need to consider the condition @xmath119 as representing a spontaneously broken symmetry .",
    "in sections  [ sec : wgt][sec : sigtg ] , we have focussed our attention on locally scale - invariant gauge theories for which local poincar invariance is extended to include invariance under local changes of scale by gauging the weyl group . in section  [ sec : wgt ] , we assumed the ` normal ' form for the transformation of the rotational gauge field under local dilations to obtain the well - known weyl gauge theory ( wgt ) .",
    "this approach provides a systematic means of constructing both free gravitational and matter actions in which each term ( and hence the full action in each case ) is invariant under local dilations , in addition to gct and local lorentz rotations , by the introduction of a new ( vector ) gravitational gauge field related to local dilations and the construction of an associated and more general covariant derivative .",
    "moreover , in section  [ sec : ewgt ] , we presented a novel alternative to wgt by considering a more general ` extended ' form of the transformation law of the rotational gauge field under local dilation , which includes the ` normal ' transformation law of wgt as a special case .",
    "the resulting ` extended ' weyl gauge theory ( ewgt ) again relies on the introduction of a new ( vector ) gravitational gauge field related to these ` extended ' local dilations and the construction of an even more general associated covariant derivative .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , however , one may construct pgts ( see appendix  [ app : pgt ] for a summary of pgt ) that are _ already _ invariant under local dilations _ without _ the need to introduce an additional gravitational gauge field .",
    "this is possible assuming either the ` normal ' or ` extended ' transformation law for the rotational gauge field ; we will focus on the latter here , which clearly includes the former as a special case .",
    "the construction of such locally - scale - invariant pgts is achieved by requiring the free parameters in the free gravitational action @xmath36 and matter action @xmath1005 to obey certain relationships , so that , although each term in the actions may not be individually invariant under ( extended ) local dilations , @xmath36 and @xmath372 do each enjoy this property and hence so does the total action@xcite . in section",
    "[ appendix : lsipgt ] , we discuss the construction of such pgts , and in section  [ appendix : lsipgtzt ] we consider locally scale - invariant reduced pgt .      [",
    "appendix : lsipgt ]    as discussed in section  [ sec : ewgt ] , under a local dilation the ` extended ' transformations laws of the @xmath41 and @xmath49 gauge fields are given by @xmath1006 and @xmath1007 , respectively , where @xmath1008 . here @xmath648 recovers the ` normal ' transformations laws ( [ weylhtrans2])([weylatrans2 ] ) assumed in wgt and @xmath649 corresponds to the ` special ' transformation law ( [ specialt ] ) for the @xmath49 field .",

    "the wgt action also typically depends on a scalar compensator field @xmath106 , which opens up the possibility of including terms in which @xmath106 is non - minimally coupled to the gauge field strength tensors , in addition ( usually ) to kinetic and self - interaction terms for @xmath106 .",
    "although wgt has been widely studied , we make some observations that differ from typical accounts of the subject , in particular regarding the interpretation of the einstein gauge and also the equations of motion of matter fields and test particles . in the einstein gauge ,",
    "one simplifies the equations of motion by using local scale - invariance to set the compensator scalar field to a constant , @xmath453 .",
    "this is usually considered as representing the choice of some definite scale in the theory , and is often given the physical interpretation of corresponding to some spontaneous breaking of the scale symmetry .",
    "we show , however , that the equations of motion in the einstein gauge are identical in form to those obtained when working in terms of scale - invariant variables , where the latter involves no breaking of the scale symmetry .",

    "our main objective , however , is to present a novel alternative to wgt by considering a more general ` extended ' transformation law for the rotational gauge field under local dilations , which includes its ` normal ' transformation law in wgt as a special case .",
    "this is motivated by the observation that the pgt ( and wgt ) matter actions both for the dirac field and the electromagnetic field are already invariant under local dilations if one assumes this ` extended ' transformation law , in the same way as they are for the ` normal ' transformation law assumed in wgt .",
    "moreover , under a global scale transformation , the two transformation laws coincide , and so both may be considered as equally valid gauging of global weyl scale invariance .",
    "the key difference between the two sets of transformations is that , whereas under the ` normal ' weyl transformations the pgt gauge fields @xmath8 and @xmath7 transform covariantly with weights of @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively , under the ` extended ' transformations the rotational gauge field @xmath7 transforms inhomogeneously .",
    "this has the consequence that the transformation properties of the pgt rotational gauge field strength ( or ` curvature ' ) @xmath125 and translational gauge field strength ( or ` torsion ' ) @xmath126 are treated in a more balanced manner .",

    "if one includes a term quadratic in @xmath717 , however , it contributes terms to the resulting field equations that are linear in fourth - order derivatives of the @xmath8 field .",
    "nonetheless , as we discussed in section  [ sec : ewgtsecondorder ] , there are grounds for omitting the term quadratic in @xmath717 from the action and , moreover , even if this term is included , the theory may still not suffer from ostrogradsky s instability .",
    "* the trace @xmath1084 of the ewgt translational gauge field strength vanishes identically , which has a number of consequences .",

    "the above choice for the gravitational lagrangian density simplifies the general structure of the pgt gravitational field equations a little , since @xmath338 does not depend on derivatives of the @xmath41-field .",

    "thus , as discussed above , the latter may be expressed in terms of the @xmath41-field , and is no longer an independent field .",
    "moreover , from ( [ sigcontract ] ) , we find that @xmath1187 since @xmath1188}$ ] for dirac matter and so all contractions of the spin - angular - momentum tensor vanish . an immediate consequence of ( [ uvanish ] ) is that the second gravitational field equation ( [ ecfe2a ] ) takes the much simpler form @xmath1189 .",
    "more interestingly , the condition ( [ uvanish ] ) implies that the covariant dirac equation reduces to @xmath1190 which is precisely the form that would be obtained by applying the minimal - coupling procedure directly at the level of the dirac equation , rather than at the level of the action .",

    ", we will instead retain the more general form ( [ diracgravlag ] ) .    a more profound difference between our approach and that originally taken by dirac is that we will consider the theory in the context of wgt in minkowski spacetime , rather than as a metric - based geometrical theory , although the former is easily interpreted in geometric terms , as discussed in section  [ sec : geowgt ] .",
    "perhaps more importantly , we will obtain the corresponding field equations by varying the action ( [ diracgravlag ] ) with respect to the four independent fields @xmath8 , @xmath7 , @xmath81 and @xmath106 respectively@xcite , whereas dirac varied his geometrically - interpreted action with respect to @xmath81 , @xmath106 and the spacetime metric @xmath565 .",
    "our approach is thus closer in spirit to the palatini formalism in geometric theories , in which the metric and the connection are varied independently , as opposed to variation with respect to the metric alone , assuming a predetermined form of the connection .",

    "it is worth noting that this conclusion precludes dirac s original hope of substantiating a time - varying gravitational parameter @xmath118 and his large numbers hypothesis . to obtain the forms of the field equations ( [ diracgrav - heqn])([diracgrav - phieqn ] ) in the einstein gauge , one merely sets @xmath119 and makes the replacement @xmath1225 throughout .",
    "it is also convenient to set @xmath1226 , where @xmath37 is einstein s gravitational constant , which is a dimensionally consistent identification .    in this case",

    "thus , one recovers the @xmath41-field equation ( [ hfieldeqn ] ) from standard ec theory , with the addition of an extra term on the lhs representing a cosmological constant , and extra terms on the rhs denoting the energy - momentum of the dilation gauge field @xmath81 , which we recognise as that of a massive vector field ( or proca field ) of mass - squared @xmath1229 .    in the einstein gauge , the @xmath49-field equation ( [ diracgrav - aeqn ] ) becomes @xmath1230 where we have written the result in terms of pgt ( unstarred ) quantities for later convenience .",
    "this equation is identical to the form ( [ afieldeqn ] ) in ec theory .",
    "thus , on imposing the einstein gauge , we find that dirac gravitational theory reduces simply to ec theory , but with the addition of a cosmological constant and the massive vector field @xmath81 .",
    "since the field equation ( [ dgafe ] ) is algebraic , rather than differential , we must again conclude that , as in ec theory , the torsion is non - propagating ; this arises from the free gravitational lagrangian ( [ dgtlgfree ] ) not containing any ` @xmath121 ' terms .    adopting the einstein gauge ,",
    "the equation of motion ( [ diracgrav - beqn ] ) for the @xmath205-field reads @xmath1231 + \\nu",

    "it is worth re - iterating at this point that , when written in terms of the scale - invariant variables defined in ( [ wgtsivardef ] ) , the full field equations ( [ diracgrav - heqn])([diracgrav - phieqn ] ) have precisely the same form as those in ( [ dghafe])([einphi ] ) obtained in the einstein gauge , after replacing ( in the latter set ) the matter field @xmath0 and the gravitational gauge fields @xmath8 , @xmath7 and @xmath81 ( and hence the pgt covariant derivative and the field strength tensors @xmath97 , @xmath1233 and @xmath293 and their contractions ) with their scale - invariant counterparts ( notated with carets ) discussed in section  [ sec : wgteinstein ] .",
    "let us now consider the particular case where the matter is described by a dirac field .",
    "following the discussion in section  [ sec : wgtdirac ] , an appropriate locally weyl covariant lagrangian for the dirac field is given by @xmath1234 where @xmath116 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath117 has the dimensions of mass in natural units",
    ".    the energy - momentum and spin - angular - momentum tensors of the dirac field @xmath111 are again given by ( [ diracemt ] ) and ( [ diracsam ] ) respectively , but with @xmath157 replaced by @xmath117 .",
    "since @xmath81 does not appear in ( [ dgtdlag ] ) , the dilation current @xmath1235 for the dirac field .",
    "moreover , since the @xmath49-field equation ( [ dgafe ] ) in the einstein gauge is identical to ( [ ecfe2a ] ) in ec theory , from ( [ covardiracec ] ) , we again have @xmath1236 .",
    "thus , the equation of motion for the dirac field is simply @xmath1237 which , in turn , ensures that @xmath84 evaluates to zero on shell . as a result",
    ", the trace of the energy - momentum tensor of the dirac field is easily found to be @xmath1238 . applying the einstein gauge condition @xmath119 to the above results",
    "is trivial .      in the einstein gauge ,",
    "both the @xmath41-field and @xmath49-field equations are identical to those in standard ec theory , with the addition of a cosmological constant and the dilation gauge field .",
    "it is therefore worth exploring the @xmath205-field equation in more detail to determine what additional physics beyond ec theory ( if any ) is contained in dirac gravitational theory sourced by dirac matter . expanding out the field strengths on the lhs of ( [ einb ] ) in terms of the @xmath205-field , swapping the order of some covariant derivatives , and employing the results ( [ sigcontract ] ) , ( [ tfromsigma ] ) and ( [ uvanish ] ) from ec theory with dirac matter , after a long calculation one obtains @xmath1239=0,\\phantom{ab } \\label{dgbfemid2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath1240 and @xmath831 is the spin - angular - momentum tensor of the dirac field ( evaluated in the einstein gauge ) .",
    "thus we see that the massive vector field @xmath1241 has a non - minimal coupling to the gravitational field and only couples to the dirac matter field through its spin - angular - momentum .",
    "moreover , in modelling a realistic matter fluid composed of spin-1/2 particles , one would expect spin - averaging effects to result in the spin - angular - momentum that the dirac field would otherwise represent being massively diluted .",
    "thus , we expect the vector field to be only weakly interacting with ordinary matter and it hence makes an interesting dark matter candidate .",
    "clearly , in the case where the ( effective ) spin - angular - momentum of the matter field vanishes ( and thus so does the torsion ) , then ( [ dgbfemid2 ] ) reduces to the equation of motion for a free massive vector field of mass @xmath157 non - minimally coupled to the gravitational field .    in closing",
    ", it is worth pointing out that , in addition to automatically containing a candidate for dark matter , dirac gravitational theory also provides a natural means for introducing a cosmological constant term in the gravitational field equation ( [ dghafe ] ) .",
    "thus , it would seem worthwhile to explore its phenomenology further , in particular its cosmological consequences .",
    "[ appendix : altddagderiv ]    we present here an alternative approach to deriving the form of the covariant derivative ( [ ewgtcovdiv ] ) in ewgt , which is complementary to that presented in section  [ sec : elwi ] and was , in fact , the original route taken by the authors .",
    "in particular , in this approach the weyl weight @xmath122 of the field on which the covariant derivative acts does not need to be inserted ` by hand ' , but instead arises naturally .",
    "one begins by noting that in the standard wgt covariant derivative ( [ weyldmudef ] ) , namely @xmath1242 , the value of @xmath122 has to change depending on the weyl weight of the field on which it acts and this leads to the commutator of two such derivatives being similarly non - unique .",
    "this might all be deemed somewhat displeasing .",
    "thus , as an alternative , one might instead consider introducing a vector dilation gauge field ( called @xmath654 to distinguish it from the field @xmath81 in wgt ) in a different manner , by including it in a modified rotational gauge field of the form ( [ adaggerdef ] ) , namely @xmath1243 where @xmath656 . in turn , this leads one to introduce the new derivative operators @xmath1244 as mentioned at the start of section  [ sec : ewgt ] , the pgt matter actions for the massless dirac field and the electromagnetic field are already invariant under local dilations with the extended transformation law ( [ eweylatrans ] ) for the @xmath49-field , in the same way as the are for the normal transformation law ( [ weylatrans2 ] ) . indeed",
    ", this provides a strong motivation for considering the extended form .",
    "this does mean , however , that one can not determine the transformation law under local dilations of the gauge field @xmath654 , and hence either derivative operator in ( [ dnatdef ] ) , by the usual technique of replacing the pgt covariant derivative @xmath383 with @xmath1245 in either the dirac or electromagnetic field action , and demanding invariance under local dilations .",
    "as an alternative , however , one can fix the transformation properties of @xmath654 by demanding instead that the field strength tensor derived from the commutator of two derivatives transforms covariantly under local dilations .",
    "one finds that the commutator is given by @xmath1246{\\varphi}= \\tfrac{1}{2}{r^{\\dagger      ab}}_{\\mu\\nu}\\sigma_{ab}{\\varphi},\\ ] ] where @xmath702 is the ewgt rotational gauge field strength found previously and given in ( [ eqn : rdaggerdef ] ) .",
    "then , demanding that @xmath702 transforms covariantly under local dilations with the extended transformation law for the @xmath49-field , one requires that , as found previously , the dilation gauge field transforms as @xmath1247 where @xmath1248 .",
    "this transformation for @xmath654 implies that the modified rotational gauge field @xmath910 in ( [ adaggerdefrepeat ] ) , and hence the field strength tensor @xmath702 , are both invariant @xmath1249 under extended local dilations .",
    "one can then define @xmath1250 as before , which transforms covariantly with weight @xmath640 .    by adopting the transformation law ( [ eqn : vtransagain ] ) for @xmath654",
    ", however , one quickly finds that @xmath1251 does _ not _ transform covariantly under extended local dilations , hence explaining our reluctance thus far to call @xmath1252 ( or @xmath1253 ) a covariant derivative .",
    "nonetheless , using the covariant field strength tensor @xmath750 that we have constructed , one can still define a new scale - invariant theory of gravity identical to that presented in section  [ sec : sigtg ] , but with @xmath1001 in the free gravitational lagrangian @xmath13 and @xmath1254 in the matter lagrangian @xmath84 , since we have not ( yet ) defined the quantities appearing in these terms . by varying the resulting total lagrangian with respect to the gauge fields @xmath8 and @xmath7 ( and also @xmath654 and @xmath106 , if desired , although this does not yield independent field equations ) , one obtains precisely the same equations of motion as those presented in section  [ sec : sigtgfeqns ] , but with @xmath1255 .",
    "these equations of motion are covariant under extended local dilations , despite @xmath1245 not being a covariant derivative . indeed , for any covariant field @xmath413",
    "( which may be either a matter field @xmath0 or @xmath106 , or the rotational gauge field strength tensor @xmath750 ) , inspection of the equations of motion allows one to _ identify _ the terms that need to be added to @xmath1256 to assemble the appropriate _ covariant _ derivative @xmath859 . in each case , one finds that @xmath1257 , where @xmath696 has the form ( [ ewgtcovdiv ] ) , but with the appropriate value of the weyl weight @xmath122 of the field @xmath413 picked out automatically .",
    "similarly , inspection of the equations of motion allows one to identify the covariant object @xmath747 . indeed , once one has picked out the appropriate form of the ewgt covariant derivative operator @xmath737 , one can then consider its commutator ( [ ewgtdacomm ] ) and identify @xmath747 and also @xmath717 as further gauge field strength tensors , as introduced in section  [ sec : ewgtgfs ]",
    "these can then be added to the total lagrangian , as before , to arrive back at the full scale - invariant gauge theory of gravity discussed in section  [ sec : sigtg ] , without requiring @xmath1255 .",

    "99          note that , while @xmath8 and @xmath7 are relatively standard notations for the translational and rotational gravitational gauge fields , respectively , the choice of notation for their corresponding field strength tensors varies considerably between authors ; we have adopted a notation that anticipates the geometrical interpretation of these tensors as the curvature and ( minus ) torsion , respectively , of a riemann  cartan ( @xmath1163 ) spacetime .",
    "if one varies only the fields and not the coordinates , as in the derivation of the euler ",
    "lagrange equations resulting from a given action , for example , then the ` total ' variation @xmath1258 and the ` form ' variation @xmath21 clearly coincide , and is usually denoted by the former .",

    "weyl attempted to interpret the new gauge field @xmath81 as the electromagnetic 4-potential and thereby provide a unified description of gravity and electromagnetism .",
    "as einstein later showed , however , the field @xmath81 interacts in the same manner with both particles and antiparticles , contrary to all experimental evidence about electromagnetic interactions .",
    "it was only later realised@xcite that electromagnetism was related to localisation of invariance under change of quantum - mechanical phase and , much later , that @xmath81 might be interpreted as an additional _ gravitational _ interaction .",
    "a re - expression of the dirac lagrangian is presented in appendix  [ appendix : dirac ] , which lends itself to the modelling of classical point matter particles , which we will discuss in section  [ sec : wgtmassivemotion ] .",
    "it is worth noting that the form adopted for the @xmath196-covariant derivative @xmath213 in ( [ weyldmudef ] ) constitutes a _ choice _ about how to include the rotational and dilational gauge fields @xmath7 and @xmath81 , respectively , which leads directly to the requirements ( [ atrans ] ) and ( [ btransdef ] ) on their transformation properties .",
    "it is worth noting that , under a local dilation alone , if the field @xmath0 has weight @xmath122 , then @xmath1264 also transforms covariantly with weight @xmath122 , whereas @xmath82 has weight @xmath677 .    since @xmath245 is not symmetric , placing @xmath249 into its first ` slot '",
    "instead will , in general , lead to a new vector field that is _ different _ from @xmath256 , so that , for example , @xmath1265 .",
    "we will not , however , need to consider this eventuality and may restrict our attention to the case in which the first index on the components of @xmath245 ( and @xmath247 ) is latin and the second is greek .",
    "unfortunately , this presents us with a notational difficulty . for objects possessing several indices",
    ", one should , in principle , use a different kernel symbol for each possible combination of latin and greek indices , but such an approach would quickly become unwieldy .",
    "so , in general , we will simply retain the original kernel letter , while keeping the above observations in mind . as a compromise",
    ", however , we will adopt the notation used above , which is in keeping with the definition ( [ weylgencovdef ] ) , that the kernel letter of a quantity possessing _ only _ latin indices ( and its contractions over such indices ) is the calligraphic font version of the kernel letter of the quantity possessing only greek indices ( following lasenby , doran & gull ) , with the exception of quantities having greek or lower - case kernel letters .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that , in terms of their counterparts @xmath1266 and @xmath1267 in pgt ( see appendix  [ app : pgt ] ) , one has @xmath1268 and @xmath1269 , so that the decomposition ( [ afromht ] ) or ( [ astarzerodef ] ) also holds with all asterisks removed from the rhs .",
    "it is worth noting that the pgt ( and wgt ) rotational gauge field strength tensor ( or ` curvature ' ) @xmath125 is already covariant under local dilations , whereas the pgt translational gauge field strength ( or ` torsion ' ) @xmath126 is not ; one must instead introduce the wgt ` torsion ' ( [ tstarfromt ] ) .",
    "one could alternatively define @xmath1270 , @xmath1271 , and @xmath1272 , and similarly for the matter sector .",
    "this choice corresponds more closely to the standard ` metrical ' versions of such tensors , but we will not adopt this convention here .",
    "we note that , slightly unusually , in the last two definitions it is not the @xmath41-field , but its inverse , that is used to convert a greek index into a roman one ; this should be borne in mind when dealing with these quantities .",
    "it is worth noting that this form for the equation of motion of a test particle appears naturally in scalar - tensor gravity theory@xcite . in the standard interpretation ,",
    "the scalar field in scalar - tensor gravity in fact plays the same role of introducing a physical scale , in a similar manner to the scalar field in the wgt , although see section  [ sec : wgteinstein ] for a further discussion of this issue .",
    "it is easily shown that @xmath1274 ( which does not depend on the dilation gauge field @xmath81 ) , so the kinetic term in the dirac action in reduced pgt is already invariant under local dilations , in the same way as its counterpart in ` full ' pgt , as discussed in section  [ sec : wgtdirac ] .",
    "we need not consider the local lorentz and gct parts of the transformation , since the behaviour of the gravitational gauge fields @xmath8 and @xmath7 under these transformations will remain the same as in wgt .",
    "the arbitrary parameter @xmath639 could , in principle , be promoted to a field @xmath1275 .",
    "provided it has weyl weight @xmath209 , one would obtain the same @xmath1276-independent form for the ewgt covariant derivative @xmath696 and the same gauge theory .",
    "the dagger on the derivative operator is simply to distinguish the ewgt covariant derivative from the pgt and wgt covariant derivatives @xmath700 and @xmath231 , respectively , and should not be confused with the operation of hermitian conjugation . in particular",
    ", we note that the ewgt covariant derivative @xmath1277{\\varphi}$ ] represents a far more substantial modification to @xmath1133 than the wgt covariant derivative @xmath1278 .          in terms of their counterparts @xmath1266 and @xmath1279 in pgt ( see appendix  [ app : pgt ] )",
    ", one has @xmath1280 and @xmath1281 , so confirming that the decomposition ( [ adaggerzerodef ] ) also holds with all daggers removed , as discussed in section  [ sec : wgtcovdalt ] .",
    "it is easily shown that @xmath1282 ( which does not depend on the dilation gauge field @xmath654 ) , so the kinetic term in the dirac action in reduced pgt is already invariant under extended local dilations , in the same way as its counterpart in ` full ' pgt , as discussed in section  [ sec : ewgtdirac ] .",
    "it is worth noting that the semi - metricity condition ( [ ewgtsemimet ] ) and that given in ( [ wgtsemimet ] ) for wgt can both be written as @xmath1283 , where @xmath945 is the metric connection ; this also holds in pgt .",
    "the expression ( [ ewgtlr2 ] ) can also be written in a form for which its symmetries are more manifest , namely @xmath1284}{\\cal   r}^{\\dagger [ ab ] } + \\alpha'_4 { \\cal r}^\\dagger_{a(bc)d}{\\cal r}^{\\dagger a(bc)d } + \\alpha'_5 { \\cal r}^\\dagger_{a[bc]d}{\\cal r}^{\\dagger a[bc]d } + \\alpha_6 { \\cal r}^\\dagger_{abcd}{\\cal r}^{\\dagger cdab } , $ ] where the new coefficients are @xmath1285 , @xmath1286 , @xmath1287 and @xmath1288 . in this case , the ewgt version of the gauss  bonnet identity allows one to set @xmath31 or @xmath33 to zero as before , or set @xmath1289 .",
    "one might even consider the case in which @xmath36 and @xmath372 are themselves not individually invariant under ( extended ) local dilations , but the total action @xmath1293 is so .",
    "we will not pursue this class of theories , however , since they would require the presence of ( non locally - scale - invariant ) matter to induce local scale invariance of the full theory in the presence of gravitation ( although such a possibility can not be ruled out _ a priori _ ) .",
    "it seems more natural to demand the theory to be scale invariant _ in vacuo _ , in which case @xmath36 and @xmath372 must be separately locally scale invariant .",
    "one may also straightforwardly include the electromagnetic field in @xmath434 , coupled both to the dirac field and to gravity , in an analogous manner to that discussed at the end of section  [ sec : wgtem ] , but will we not consider this extension here .            moreover , after a long but straightforward calculation , one may show that @xmath1152 is itself related to the corresponding wgt quantity @xmath543 by @xmath1294 } + 2\\delta^{[b}_c({^0}{\\cal d}_d - { \\cal b}_d){\\cal b}^{a ] } -2 { \\cal b}^e { \\cal b}_e \\delta^{[a}_c \\delta^{b]}_d$ ] , from which one finds that their contractions are related by @xmath1295 and @xmath1296 .",
    "similarly , @xmath1152 and its contractions are related to the corresponding ewgt quantities by the same relationships , but with the replacements @xmath1297 and @xmath1298 .",
    "it is probably fair to say that dirac would not have considered @xmath13 in ( [ dgtlgfree ] ) to be his entire gravitational lagrangian , and would have also included the term proportional to @xmath335 that appears in ( [ diracgravlagm ] ) .",
    "since this term contains the scalar field @xmath106 , however , we have instead included it in the matter lagrangian .",
    "in fact , dirac s original theory has vanishing torsion and so he proposed a matter lagrangian of the form ( [ diracgravlagm ] ) , but with the wgt covariant derivative and ricci scalar replaced by their ` reduced ' versions @xmath1299 and @xmath1300 , respectively , as described in section  [ sec : wgtcovdalt ] .",
