    "as discussed in @xcite-@xcite the approach , with appropriately adjusted scales , could have therefore more generally a potential for an effective description of nonpointlike particles , such as e.g. nucleons or quasi - particles in solids .",
    "analogously , on large scales a minimal uncertainty @xmath5 may offer new possibilities to describe situations where momentum can not be precisely determined , in particular on curved space @xcite . using the path integral formulation",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that such noncommutative background geometries can ultraviolet and infrared regularise quantum field theories in arbitrary dimensions through minimal uncertainties @xmath6 . however ,",
    "a complete analysis of the modified short distance structure , and in particular the calculation of the states of maximal localisation , has so far only been carried out for the special case of the commutation relations",

    "the reason is that those cases are representation theoretically much easier to handle in which either @xmath2 or @xmath3 vanish , i.e. with minimal uncertainties in either positions or in momenta only .",

    "a very interesting canonical field theoretical approach with a similar motivation is focusing on generalising the uncertainty relations among the coordinates @xcite .",

    "as is clear from the definition of uncertainties , e.g. @xmath21 , eigenvectors to @xmath18 or @xmath19 could only have vanishing uncertainty in position or momentum .",

    "while ordinarily self - adjoint extensions , e.g. for a particle in a box , need to and can be fixed , there is now the subtle effect of the self - adjoint extensions not being on common domains , which prevents the diagonalisation of @xmath18 or @xmath19 on physical states , as can also be understood through the uncertainty relations . for the full functional analytical details",
    "see @xcite , where these structures have first been found .",

    "in quantum field theory , interaction terms which on ordinary geometry would be ultraviolet regular but nonlocal , can in fact be regular and strictly local on a geometry with a minimal position uncertainty .",
    "the reason is that an interaction is to be considered strictly local if no nonlocality could be observed .",
    "intuitivly this is the case if a small apparent nonlocality of the interaction term is unobservable due to a comparatively larger minimal uncertainty in the underlying space .",
    "we already mentioned that , as has been shown in @xcite , quantum field theories can be naturally regularised when working on a generalised geometry with intrinsic minimal uncertainties . generally , in order to explicitly compare the size of nonlocality of an arbitrary interaction term with the size of the intrinsic uncertainty of the generalised geometry",
    "it is crucial to have available the states of maximal localisation on this geometry .",
    "similarly , maximal localisation in a momentum space with minimal uncertainty @xmath5 is of interest in the context of infrared regularisation .    so far",
    ", we have studied the properties of the maximal localisation states in one dimension only .",
    "the generalised fourier transformations which map between the ( quasi- ) position and the ( quasi- ) momentum representations have only been studied in the special case @xmath113 . for",
    "the general case techniques should be useful which have been developed for the fourier theory @xcite on quantum planes @xcite .",
    "also , the unitary equivalence of _ all hilbert space representations , in the sense in which it holds for the ordinary commutation relations , has not yet been proven .",
    "most interesting further physical insight into the nature of these generalised geometries can be expected from studies on maximal localisation in @xmath45 dimensions where @xmath0\\ne 0 $ ] and @xmath1\\ne 0 $ ] lead also to @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
    "* acknowledgement * _",
    "a.k . would like to thank prof .",
    "t koornwinder for the kind invitation to give a seminar in amsterdam and a very useful discussion on @xmath32- hermite polynomials .",
    "in the following we outline a proof for the equivalence of the formula of rodriguez eq.[rodriguez ] and the recurrence relation eq.[reca ] .",
    "we use the notation @xmath137 which allows the differentiation of products to be written in the form : [ productrule ] d(fg ) = ( df)(ag ) + ( af)(dg ) .",
    "we first prove the identity [ appeq1 ] d^n+1 q^-j^2 = - ( ) ^2 ( q^-2n+1 [ n]d^n-1 + xq^-n d^n ) q^-j^2 . the case @xmath66 can be verified easily by hand .",
    "induction from @xmath45 to @xmath138 implies that [ appeq2 ] d^n+1 q^-j^2 = d(d^n q^-j^2 ) = -d ( ) ^2 ( q^-2n+3 [ n-1]d^n-2 + xq^-n+1 d^n-1 ) q^-j^2 comparing the r.h.s . of eqs.[appeq1 ] and",
    "[ appeq2 ] and using eq.[productrule ] , one is led to the condition [ appeq3 ] ( ad^n+1 + 12(q - q^-1)xd^n - q^-nd^n-1 ) q^-j^2 = 0 which can be proved by a further induction where the identities @xmath139 turn out to be very useful .",
    "once eq.[appeq1 ] is proved , one obtains the recursion relation eq.[reca ] by inserting the formula of rodriguez which completes the proof .",
    "we prove the limits @xmath140 i.e. we prove eqs.[cplus],[consta ] : [ lemma1 ] c^+(x _ ) = _ m ( -)^m c_2m(x _ ) = q^^2/2_2 ( , ) let us first rewrite expression eq.[cexplicit ] by c_2 m ( x _ ) = _ k =- m^m ( 2 m m+k ) _ q^2 ( -)^m+k q^2k .",
    "choosing an integer @xmath141 we split up this sum into two parts ( -)^m c_2m(x _ ) = s_m , r^(1 ) + s_m , r^(2 ) where s_m , r^(1 ) & = & _ k =- r^r ( 2 m m+k ) _",
    "q^2 ( -)^k q^2k + s_m , r^(2 ) & = & _ k = r+1^m ( 2 m m+k ) _ q^2 ( -)^k ( q^2k+q^-2k ) now let @xmath68 go to infinity and keep @xmath142 fixed . since @xmath143 and eq.[qinverse ] we have the identity [ binomidentity ] ( 2 m m+k ) _ q^2 = q^2 ( m^2-k^2 ) ( 2 m m+k ) _ q^-2 .",
    "because of _ m ( 2 m m+k ) _",
    "q^-2 = the first part converges to s_r^(1 ) = _ m s_m , r^(1 ) = _ k =- r^r(-)^kq^2k-2k^2 .",
    "the second part @xmath144 can be estimated as follows .",
    "as can be seen from eq.[binomidentity ] the inequality ( 2 m m+k ) _",
    "q^-2 = = implies that ( 2 m m+k ) _ q^2 . therefore |s_m , r^(2)| _ k = r+1^m ( 2 m m+k ) _",
    "q^2k _ k = r+1^m q^2(k - k^2 ) so that [ estimation ] |s_r^(2)| = |_m s_m , r^(2)| _ k=1^ q^2(k - k^2 ) . since the sum on the r.h.s . is finite this expression tends to zero as @xmath142 goes to infinity .",
    "thus we conclude that [ sumexpression ] c^+(x _ ) = _ r s_r^(1 ) = _ k=-^(-)^kq^2k-2k^2 .",
    "the sum on the r.h.s . of this expression is essentially a jacobi @xmath145-function . in order to see this notice that its definition eq.[theta2 ] can also be written as _",
    "2(z , e^- ) = _ k=0^ ( -)^k e^-(z - k)^2 . inserting @xmath146 and @xmath147",
    "we can express the sum in eq.[sumexpression ] by _",
    "k=-^ ( -)^k q^-2k^2 + 2k = q^^2/2 _ 2(z , ) which completes the proof for @xmath148 .",
    "the proof for @xmath149 follows the same lines .",
