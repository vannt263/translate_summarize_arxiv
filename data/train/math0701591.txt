    "this paper deals with various notions originating from the theory of tight closure , which we now review briefly . let @xmath0 be a commutative ring of prime characteristic @xmath1 ; for each ideal @xmath2 we define the _ @xmath3 frobenius power _ of @xmath4 , denoted @xmath5}$ ] , to be the ideal of @xmath0 generated by @xmath6 . for any ideal @xmath2 we can then define its _ tight closure ,",
    "_ denoted @xmath7 , to be the set of all @xmath8 such that for some @xmath9 not in a minimal prime of @xmath0 we have @xmath10}$ ] for all @xmath11 .",
    "tight closure is indeed a closure operation , in the sense that @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; we refer the reader to the seminal paper @xcite and to @xcite for a description of tight closure and its properties .",
    "tight closure has played an important role in many recent advances in commutative algebra .",
    "a short sample of its useful applications could include short proofs to some of the homological conjectures , the study of singularities , positive - characteristic analogues of multiplier ideals and many more .    among the most interesting and useful results obtained early in the development of the theory of tight closure",
    "is the existence of _ test - elements _ ( cf .",
    "chapter 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "notice that the element @xmath9 occurring in the definition of tight closure could depend on the ideal @xmath4 and the element @xmath14 .",
    "test - elements are elements @xmath9 not in any minimal prime such that for _ all _ ideals @xmath2 and _ all _ @xmath8 , @xmath15 if and only if @xmath10}$ ] for all @xmath16 .",
    "notice , for example , that @xmath17 for all ideals @xmath2 if and only if @xmath18 is a test - element ( in this case we refer to tight closure as being a _ trivial operation _ ) .",
    "test - elements exist in many rings of interest ( e.g. , reduced algebras of finite type over excellent local rings ) and they play a vital role .",
    "one also defines the _ test - ideal _ of @xmath0 to be the ideal generated by all test - elements .    in many applications",
    "one restricts one s attention to local rings and to the tight - closure of ideals generated by systems of parameters .",
    "one then naturally considers the notion of _ parameter - test - ideals _ : these are elements @xmath9 not in any minimal prime such that for all ideals @xmath2 _ generated by a system of parameters _ and all @xmath8 , @xmath15 if and only if @xmath10}$ ] for all @xmath16 .",
    "it is worth noting that when @xmath0 is a gorenstein ring , the notions of parameter - test - ideals and test - ideals coincide ( cf .  chapter 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the calculation of tight closure is notoriously hard no general algorithm is known and specific calculations are carried out with technical ad - hoc methods ( for example , see @xcite for such a calculation of a seemingly simple example which settled a major conjecture ) . there is not even an algorithm for deciding whether the tight closure operation in a given ring is trivial .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to provide a description of parameter test ideals of local cohen - macaulay rings of prime characteristic @xmath1 .",
    "the nature of this description will be such that it will allow us to give an algorithm for producing these ideals . as a result one also obtains an algorithm for deciding whether a ring is _ @xmath19-rational , _",
    "i.e. , whether the tight closure of ideals generated by systems of parameters is trivial ; in the gorenstein case this property is equivalent to the tight closure of _ all _ ideals being trivial .    the results in this paper will follow from an analysis of frobenius maps on injective hulls of the residue fields @xmath20 of the ring",
    "@xmath0 under consideration , i.e. , of additive maps @xmath21 which satisfy @xmath22 for all @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this analysis is inspired by gennady lyubeznik s work on @xmath19-modules and indeed , a crucial tool used here , namely , the functors @xmath25 defined in section [ section : a duality ] below , are nothing but `` the first step '' in the construction of lyubeznik s @xmath26 functors in section 4 of @xcite .    the study of @xmath0-modules with frobenius maps can be elucidated by treating them as left modules over a certain skew polynomial ring @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "a crucial ingredient in this paper is rodney sharp s recent study of these modules in general , and of the @xmath27$]-module structure of the top local cohomology module in particular .",
    "in @xcite the parameter test ideal of @xmath0 was described in terms of certain @xmath27$]-submodules of the top local cohomology of @xmath0 , and it is this description on which our explicit description and algorithm is based on .    along the way we gain new insights into the @xmath27$]-module structure of injective hulls of residue fields which translate into new results .",
    "one such result is an algorithm for computing the index of nilpotency ( in the sense of section 4 of @xcite ) of top local cohomology modules , which , together with the results in @xcite translate into an algorithm for computing the frobenius closure of parameter ideals in cohen - macaulay local rings and in view of @xcite provide an important ingredient for the corresponding computation in generalized cohen - macaulay rings as well .",
    "another spinoff is a very simple proof of a crucial ingredient in @xcite which together with corollary 3.6 there gives an alternative proof of the fact that for a power series ring @xmath28 of prime characteristic , for all nonzero @xmath29 , @xmath30 generates @xmath31 as a @xmath32-module .",
    "let @xmath0 be a commutative ring of prime characteristic @xmath1 and let @xmath33 be an @xmath0-module .",
    "a _ frobenius map _ on @xmath33 is a @xmath34-linear map @xmath35 with the property that @xmath36 for all @xmath24 and @xmath37 .",
    "the fundamental example of a frobenius map is _ the _ frobenius map @xmath38 given by @xmath39 .",
    "the frobenius map allows us to endow @xmath0 with a structure of an @xmath0-bimodule : as a left @xmath0-module it has the usual @xmath0-module structure whereas @xmath0 acts on itself on the right via the frobenius map . we shall denote this bimodule @xmath40 and so for all @xmath41 and @xmath24 , @xmath42 while @xmath43 , where @xmath44 denotes the action of @xmath0 .",
    "we can extend this construction to obtain the _ frobenius functor _",
    "@xmath19 sending any @xmath0-module @xmath33 to @xmath45 where @xmath0 acts on @xmath46 via its left - action on @xmath40 , so for @xmath47 and @xmath48 we have @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we shall repeatedly ( and tacitly ) use the fact that the functor @xmath51 is exact whenever @xmath0 is regular ( theorem 2.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "iterations @xmath52 of frobenius maps @xmath35 result in maps @xmath53 which satisfy @xmath54 for all @xmath24 and @xmath37 .",
    "more generally , we will consider the set @xmath55 of all @xmath34-linear maps @xmath56 which satisfy @xmath57 for all @xmath24 and @xmath37 .",
    "we can give @xmath55 the structure of an @xmath0-module : for any @xmath58 and @xmath8 we simply let @xmath59 the map sending @xmath37 to @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore , we can define a product in @xmath61 to be composition of @xmath34-linear maps and thus endow @xmath62 with the structure of an @xmath0-algebra .",
    "the iteration of the frobenius map on @xmath28 leads one to the iterated frobenius functors @xmath63 which are defined for all @xmath64 recursively by @xmath65 and @xmath66 for all @xmath64 .",
    "these higher frobenius functors are also exact whenever @xmath0 is regular .    in this paper",
    "we will be interested in studying frobenius maps on injective hulls of residue fields and top local cohomology modules .",
    "an example of the latter when @xmath0 is local and @xmath67-dimensional can be obtained as follows .",
    "the top local cohomology module @xmath68 can be computed as the direct limit of @xmath69{x_1 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot x_d } \\frac{s}{(x_1 ^ 2 , \\dots , x_d^2)s }   \\xrightarrow[]{x_1 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot x_d } \\dots\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is a system of parameters of @xmath0 .",
    "we can define a frobenius map @xmath71 on this direct limit by mapping the coset @xmath72 in the @xmath73-th component of the direct limit to the coset @xmath74 in the @xmath75-th component of the direct limit .",
    "it is not hard to verify that this is indeed a well defined map from @xmath68 to @xmath68 and that it is a frobenius map . an important observation used in this paper",
    "is the fact that when @xmath0 is cohen - macaulay , the frobenius map @xmath76 described above generates the @xmath0-algebra @xmath77 ( cf .",
    "example 3.7 in @xcite ) .",
    "a different and fruitful way of thinking about frobenius maps on @xmath33 and their iterations is as left - module structures over certain skew - commutative rings . given any commutative ring @xmath0 we can construct a skew commutative ring @xmath78 $ ] as follows : as an @xmath0-module it will be the free module @xmath79 and we extend the rule @xmath80 for all @xmath24 to a ( non - commutative ! ) multiplicative structure on @xmath78 $ ] . given a frobenius map @xmath81 on an @xmath0-module @xmath33 , we can then turn it into a left @xmath78$]-module by extending the rule @xmath82 for all @xmath37 .",
    "the fact that this gives @xmath33 the structure of a left @xmath78$]-module is simply because for all @xmath24 and @xmath37 , @xmath83 this approach has been taken in many previous papers , the most relevant to us being @xcite .",
    "in this section we set up the main tool , based on matlis duality , which will enable us to explore @xmath84$]-module structures of certain artinian modules .",
    "_ henceforth in this paper @xmath85 will denote a complete local regular ring of characteristic @xmath1 .",
    "we shall denote the injective hull of @xmath86 with @xmath20 and @xmath87 shall denote the functor @xmath88 .",
