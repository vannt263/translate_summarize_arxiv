    "a peculiar and a very small subclass of extragalactic radio sources called as the @xmath0-shaped or ` winged ' sources are characterised by two low - surface - brightness lobes ( the ` wings ' ) oriented at an angle to the ` active ' , or high - surface - brightness radio lobes , giving the total source an ` @xmath0 ' shape .",
    "these two sets of lobes usually pass symmetrically through the centre of the associated host galaxy .",
    "@xcite noted that majority of these sources are of fr  ii @xcite and rest are either fr  i or mixed .",
    "@xmath0-shaped sources seem to reside in different types of host galaxies .",
    "nearly half of these sources reside in fairly elliptical host galaxies .",
    "the hosts of some of these were reported to be slightly elongated and in several prominent dust disks have been found @xcite .",
    "the environments of @xmath0-shaped sources seem to be poor .",
    "almost all the sources are no part of rich clusters of groups .",
    "@xcite reported , five ( ngc  326 , 3c  223.1 , 4c 48.29 , b1059@xmath1169 3c  315 and 3c  403 ) of these sources to be located in galaxy groups or clusters .",
    "however the density of these galaxy groups or clusters is low in all cases .",
    "the x - ray result shows that only one ( ngc  326 ) is embedded in hot cluster gas , and this is the only source having a close companion galaxy .",
    "radio observations of these @xmath0-shaped sources show a high degree of polarisation ( 15%30% ) in the wings and an apparent magnetic field structure parallel to the edge of the source and along the length of the wings @xcite .",
    "further high frequency and high resolution radio polarisation images showed field lines wrapping around the edges , as well as complex internal structure ( 3c  223.1 : @xcite ; 3c  315 : @xcite ; etc . ) .",
    "several authors have attempted to explain the unusual structure in @xmath0-shaped sources .",
    "the first attempt was made by @xcite , who suggested that the jet direction precesses due to a realignment caused by the accretion of gas with respect to the central black hole axis .",
    "@xcite discussed four possible scenarios for the formation of such radio morphology : ( 1 ) backflow from the active lobes into the wings @xcite ; ( 2 ) slow conical precession of the jet axis @xcite ; ( 3 ) reorientation of the jet axis during which flow continues ; and ( 4 ) reorientation of the jet axis , but with the jet turned off or at greatly reduced power during the change of direction .",
    "@xcite suggested another possible scenario , _",
    "i.e. _ the reorientation of black holes s spin axis due to a minor merger , leading to a sudden flip in the direction of any associated jet .",
    "a variant of @xcite model was suggested by @xcite , where the sources with @xmath2 morphology within their @xmath0-shapes evolve along a @xmath2@xmath0 morphological sequence .",
    "presently , most of the observational results seem to prefer possibilities 3 , 4 of @xcite or @xcite , and the key difference between these two models is in terms of mechanism of reorientation ; former favoured the disc instability mechanism because of little evidence for recent merger , while the latter preferred the coalescence scenario .",
    "nevertheless , in all these scenarios , the wings are interpreted as relics of past radio jets and the active lobes as the newer ones .",

    "i.e. _ these sources consist of two pairs of jets , which are associated with two unresolved agns .",
    "we also presented some of the assumptions used in the spectral ageing method for estimating the age , in order to explain the unusual result .",
    "briefly , these are as follows : ( 1 ) the injection spectral index is varying @xcite . ( 2 ) in these sources , the low - surface - brightness , wings are in the process of becoming new active jets . hence , it is not surprising that they have flatter spectral index compared to the active lobes .",
    "( 3 ) presence of some exotic reacceleration mechanism together with standard alfven waves and fermi mechanisms . ( 4 ) there is a gradient in magnetic field across the source , together with a curved electron energy spectrum , which would result in spectral indices being different at distinct locations within the source @xcite .",
    "we here present the gmrt results from a systematic study of the sample of @xmath0-shaped radio sources at 240 and 610  mhz . in section  [ observations",
    "] , we describe the observations of the sample , data reduction ( section  [ data_reduction ] ) and present the images derived from gmrt at 240 and 610  mhz along with distribution of low frequency , 240610  mhz spectra across all these sources ( section  [ results ] ) .",

    "3c  192 was classified , as an @xmath0-shaped source @xcite , but was not included in the list of all such known sources @xcite , and we have included it in our sample .",
    "however , it is important to note that the images on which the selection was based have been obtained with various instruments and with vast differences in sensitivity and resolution .",
    "therefore , the sample of these twelve sources is inhomogeneous and in no sense a statistical complete sample .",
    "we adopted an observing strategy similar to our earlier observations for 3c  223.1 @xcite .",
    "the 240 and 610  mhz feeds of gmrt are coaxial feeds and therefore , simultaneous dual frequency observations at these two frequencies were performed .",
    "the primary beams are @xmath5108and @xmath543at 240 and 610  mhz , respectively .",
    "we made full synthesis observations of all the @xmath0-shaped sources 240 and 610 mhz , in the dual frequency mode , using the gmrt in the standard spectral line mode with a spectral resolution of 125 khz .",
    "these sources were observed in two cycles ( 03dvl01 : four of the eleven and 05dvl01 : seven of the eleven sources ) .",
    "table  [ observ ] gives the details of the observations .",
    "since , ngc  326 is already observed using gmrt at low frequencies , we did not perform new observations .",
    "the gmrt has a hybrid configuration @xcite with 14 of its 30 antennas located in a central compact array with size @xmath51.1  km and the remaining antennas distributed in a roughly ` y ' shaped configuration , giving a maximum baseline length of @xmath525  km .",
    "the baselines obtained from antennas in the central square are similar in length to the vla  @xmath6-array , while the baselines between the arm antennas are comparable in length to the vla  @xmath7-array . hence , a single observation with the gmrt provides both , it samples the uv plane adequately on the short baselines as well as on the long baselines and provides good angular resolution when mapping the detailed source structure with reasonably good sensitivity .",
    "the visibility data were converted to fits and analyzed using standard aips .",
    "the flux calibrators 3c  48 , 3c  147 and 3c  286 were observed depending on the availability either in the beginning and/or in the end as an amplitude calibrator and to estimate and correct for the bandpass shape .",
    "we used the flux density scale which is an extension of the @xcite scale to low frequencies , using the coefficients in aips task ` setjy ' .",
    "the secondary phase calibrator were observed at intervals of 35  min .",
    "the error in the estimated flux density , both due to calibration and systematic , is @xmath8 5% .",
    "the data suffered from scintillations and intermittent radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "in addition to normal editing of the data , the scintillations affected data and channels affected due to rfi were identified and edited , after which the central channels were averaged using aips task ` splat ' to reduce the data volume . to avoid bandwidth smearing , effective band at 240 and 610  mhz",
    "was reduced to 5 and 3 channels , respectively .",
    "while imaging , 49 facets spread across a @xmath51.@xmath98 field were used at 240  mhz and 9 facets covering slightly less than a 0.@xmath10 field , were used at 610  mhz to map each of the two fields using aips task ` imagr ' . in order to achieve high resolution images that are also sensitive to extended structure , we have employed the sdi cleaning algorithm @xcite .",
    "we used ` uniform ' weighting and the 3@xmath4d option for w  term correction throughout our analysis .",
    "the presence of a large number of point sources in the field allowed us to do phase self - calibration to improve the image .",
    "after 23 rounds of phase self - calibration , a final self - calibration of both amplitude and phase was made to get the final image . at each round of self - calibration , the image and the visibilities were compared to check for the improvement in the source model .",

    ", a few qualitative points about the overall source morphological and spectral properties , based on images presented are made .",
    "the salient features of morphology of all @xmath0-shaped sources are as follows :    1 .",
    "almost all sources show similar angular sizes for the two axes .",
    "marginal differences between two axes in 3c  192 and 3c  403 , can be attributed to the projection effects . 2 .",
    "source 3c  315 have all four lobes of almost similar surface brightness , thereby making difficult to identify the active lobes and the wings .",
    "although , 3c  433 is classified as @xmath0-shaped source , it does not have ` typical ' ` @xmath0 ' shape morphology .",
    "it also is the source with smallest angular size in the sample .",
    "the radio core is detected for only one of the source , b1059@xmath1169 in its 610 mhz map . whereas the radio maps of sources , 4c12.03 , 4c  48.29 and 3c  315 at 610 mhz show marginal detection of the radio cores .",
    "hot spots are almost always detected in the high - surface - brightness active lobes in both , 610 and 240 mhz radio maps .",
    "we detect the high - surface - brightness jets in almost , infact all the @xmath0-shaped sources and this nearly 100% , high rate of jet detection is similar to @xcite and @xcite for classical radio sources .",
    "the integrated radio flux densities at several locations across each of these sources , allow us to group them into following three categories : ( a ) sources in which the wings are of flatter spectral indices than the active lobes , _",
    "i.e. _ 4c  12.03 , 3c  223.1 and b1059@xmath1169 .",
    "these sources have spectral indices , @xmath40.22 @xmath36 @xmath40.70 and @xmath40.76 @xmath37 @xmath41.08 for all regions across the source .",
    "in addition , in the former two sources , the wings ( or low - surface - brightness jets ) have flatter spectral indices with respect to the high - surface - brightness jets at high radio frequencies @xcite , consistent with our low frequency results .",
    "( b ) sources in which the wings and the active lobes have comparable spectral indices , _",
    "3c  192 , b2  0828@xmath132 , 4c  48.29 and 3c  403 . here , these classes of sources have spectral indices , @xmath40.37 @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath38 @xmath42.79 and @xmath40.55 @xmath37 @xmath41.27 for all regions across the source",
    ". it therefore seems that although the two regions , the wings and the active lobes , have comparable spectral indices , they are relatively flat as compared to typical steep spectrum features .",
    "it is important to note , since we have limits for spectral indices of the north and south wings , we have included b2  0828@xmath132 in this category , although the south wing seems to be flatter than the active lobes .",
    "( c ) sources in which the wings are of steeper spectral indices as compared to the active lobes , _",
    "i.e. _ ngc  326 , 3c  52 , 3c  136.1 , 3c  315 and 3c  433 .",
    "this category of sources have spectral indices , @xmath40.71 @xmath40 @xmath38 @xmath43.42 and @xmath40.56 @xmath37 @xmath41.16 for all regions across the source .",
    "this latter class of sources are similar to typical radio galaxies , where low - surface - brightness features have steeper spectral indices as compared to the high - surface - brightness features , which have relatively flat spectral indices .",
    "the result of the former two classes of sources are unusual , and we believe that it is not due to possible artefacts , _ e.g. _ different uv coverages , images containing negative depression around the source , image misalignment at 240 and 610 mhz , etc . also , these results do not support the known formation scenarios , discussed below , in which the wings are interpreted as relics of past radio jets and the active lobes as the newer ones .",
    "furthermore , the results from this class of sources is consistent with earlier results that there is no trend of spectral index with jet side at any brightness level , which has been a subject of considerable debate @xcite .",
    "the most intriguing fact about @xmath0-shaped radio galaxies is the apparently small number of sources of @xmath0-shape .",
    "two possible explanations for the small number are , ( i ) they are very exotic objects that form only rarely and under extraordinary circumstances , and ( ii ) they are normal radio galaxies that are currently in a short - lived and/or rare phase of their evolution @xcite . in order to explain these , it is necessary to understand the formation process responsible for the @xmath0-shaped phenomenon .",
    "we briefly introduce the key formation mechanisms and discuss them in the light of existing observational results .",
    "@xcite have argued in favour of backflow being responsible for the formation of the wings of @xmath0-shaped sources .",
    "backflow is formed by jet material that is released by the hot  spots and is then streaming back towards the host galaxy . in the model ,",
    "the backflow material remains collimated until it meets the backflow from the opposite hot  spot and expands laterally into a fat disk oriented perpendicular to the radio lobe axis . for physical conditions prevailing in the lobes of radio galaxies , with typical advance speed of the hotspots of a few per cent of @xmath41 ,",
    "high apparent backflow speeds have been inferred with roughly constant ratio of the speed of advance and the speed of backflow @xcite .",
    "assuming backflow velocities close to magnetosonic sound speed , though real flows occur at lower speeds , and typical secondary lobe lengths of a few hundred kiloparsec , one requires a duration of the order of a few 10@xmath42  year for matter to flow from the core to the tips of the secondary lobes . this is less than the radiative age , @xmath510@xmath43  year , of @xmath0-shaped sources assuming equipartition of energy between the radiating particles and magnetic field and 610  mhz as the break frequency of the injected electron population , and/or the typical radio source lifetime of 10@xmath43  year @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this being an optimistic estimate , the true lobe lengths are larger if projection effects are taken into account , which would increase the required flow speeds . on top ,",
    "once the backflowing material leaves the primary lobes and has to penetrate into the ambient medium we expect the flow to be decelerated by ram - pressure .",
    "therefore , the required flow duration will thus be closer to a few 10@xmath43  year , which would make backflow unlikely as the dominant formation scenario unless @xmath0-shaped sources prove to be unusually  old .      on morphological grounds ,",
    "the lobes of a radio galaxy have a lower density than the surrounding medium ( williams 1991 ) .",
    "therefore , it is expected that buoyancy may have an impact on the large scale morphology of the radio lobes .",
    "@xcite have applied such a buoyancy model to ngc  326 and is unable to account for the formation of @xmath0-shaped radio galaxies .",
    "x - ray studies of gaseous environment of several such sources were not able to detect significant cluster gas emission @xcite with the exception of ngc  326 .",
    "although , this might be due to lack of sensitivity , the buoyancy model is also faced with the problem of rotational symmetry of @xmath0-shaped radio galaxies .",
    "the two angles between the primary and secondary lobes of an @xmath0-shaped source are typically equal to within @xmath1410@xmath44 , and if buoyancy would be a dominant formation process one would expect to find a more random distribution of these angles @xcite .",
    "also , the radio source must do significant work on the medium , and the total work must be comparable to the stored energy within the lobes @xcite . typically , the time - scale for formation of such sources , or the corresponding radius out to which the source expanded , is the age of the source times the average mach number ( @xmath34 1 ) for expansion ( alexander 2002 ) , which is an order of magnitude less than age of the source .",
    "in addition , the swept - up gas would become rayleigh - taylor unstable since the density of the cocoon is very much less than the external swept - up material @xcite .",
    "therefore , we also conclude that buoyancy will influence the large scale structure of radio galaxies only in dense cluster environments , as is seen for wide - angle - tail radio sources in cluster of galaxies , and it is implausible that buoyancy , without a favourable configuration of the interstellar medium or intergalactic medium , would influence the structure of @xmath0-shaped sources .",
    "the conical precession model @xcite requires not only a fortuitous angle between the precession cone and angle to the line of sight , but also a happy accident of the positions at which the source first switched on and its position now .",
    "it therefore seems unlikely that we can explain the number of such sources seen , or the lack of other related sources @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the morphologies of these sources do not seem to fit conical precision model @xcite .",
    "structures linking the wing and the lobe should at least be detected at low radio frequencies , if the morphology arose from a special projection of a slowly precessing source . instead",
    ", in almost all the sources , there is a notable lack of such a feature .",
    "furthermore , the wings being embedded well into the base also argues against any interpretation in terms of slow motion of the jet axis . given these arguments , it is unimaginable that such precession can be used as an explanation for @xmath0-shaped sources .",
    "although , at this point , we conclude that the most likely formation process of @xmath0-shaped radio galaxies is reorientation of their jet axis due to a minor merger , an apparent contradiction of the model is posed by the small number of @xmath0-shaped radio galaxies as compared to the rather large number of minor merger events .",
    "the typical duration of the agn phase is @xmath510@xmath42  yr . since , time scale for jet reorientation is short , @xmath8 10@xmath42  yr @xcite , or it occurs instantaneously @xcite , @xcite predict both types of source , @xmath0-shaped galaxy and radio galaxy , to be visible for a similar time . in other words ,",
    "similar number of sources for both types are expected .",
    "certainly , selection effects due to projection and beaming can conceal the @xmath0-shaped nature of some sources on unfavourable viewing angles . for moderate intrinsic angles",
    "the fraction of sources hidden by selection effects is @xmath525% @xcite .",
    "this suggests that , unless there is a large , hidden population of objects with very small reorientation angles , selection effects are not significant and insufficient to account for small number of @xmath0-shaped sources .",
    "another problem for the connection of merging and reorientation arises when inspecting the environments in which the hosts of @xmath0-shaped sources are embedded .",
    "none of the known sources lay in dense clusters , only a few sources seem to be located in small , poor clusters or groups and rest of the sources seem to be isolated field galaxies .",
    "although , the latter problem , could be reconciled in a minor merger model , leading to a sudden flip in the direction of any associated jet @xcite , we still need to address the small number of @xmath0-shaped radio galaxies as compared to the rather large number of minor merger events .",
    "we now discuss the implications on the assumptions of the spectral ageing method and discuss what could be the realistic formation model of @xmath0-shaped sources .",
    "it is possible that the assumptions used in the spectral ageing method for estimating the age needs to be investigated . due to the presence of all category of sources ,",
    "a , b & c , one of the assumptions , the low - surface - brightness wings are in the process of becoming new active jets , mentioned earlier @xcite does not seem true .",
    "furthermore , presence of exotic reacceleration mechanism is unlikely because of absence of any shock signatures .",
    "also , the high degree of polarised emission observed in the wings @xcite indicates that the stochastic reacceleration by plasma turbulence is not applicable in the wings of these sources . a combination of rest of the two assumptions , _ i.e. _ the injection spectral index is varying @xcite , and presence of a gradient in magnetic field across the source , together with curved electron energy spectrum",
    "@xcite could explain each of these @xmath0-shaped sources individually , but a single model presently seems implausible .",
    "it has also been argued that the @xmath0-shaped morphology is essentially a hydrodynamic phenomenon which is a result of supersonic or buoyant flow of radio plasma in an asymmetric gas distribution . @xcite and @xcite argues that the @xmath0-shaped radio morphology is a result of strong backflow of material behind the terminal hot spots of radio galaxy jets and subsequent buoyant evolution of the wings . in this model ,",
    "the lobes and the wings must have been supersonic at some time in the past , but are now evolving buoyantly .",
    "@xcite hypothesized that the @xmath0-shaped morphology is a direct result of the supersonic expansion and/or inflation of the lobe into an elliptical atmosphere and that all radio galaxies in such environments should exhibit this phenomenon . in this scenario , both the lobes and the wings should be enormously overpressurized relative to the ambient medium @xcite .",
    "although inhomogeneous and incomplete , the sample of @xmath0-shaped sources show diverse spectral morphologies and a single model with similar dynamics of the backflow / buoyancy , jet velocities , density contrast between the jet and the ambient medium , temperature and density profile of the medium , and morphology of ambient medium for these sources would be a challenge .",
    "@xcite proposed to use the low frequency spectra at different locations in the source , to distinguish between the formation models for these sources . in the simplest picture",
    ", the low - surface - brightness wings would have an older population of the electrons and therefore should have steeper spectral index as compared to the active high - surface - brightness radio lobes .",
    "but , the two categories of sources , namely , sources showing the wings to be of flatter spectral indices as compared to the active lobes ( category a ) and sources showing the wings and the active lobes to be of comparable spectral indices ( category b ) , listed above does not support this simple picture . instead , the third category of sources , five of the twelve sources , supports this picture .",
    "furthermore , none of the models mentioned earlier , support the radio results from the first two categories of sources . on top , each of these models have their own limitations , which are independent of our spectral results .",
    "@xcite first suggested the possibility that agn might contain massive binary black hole .",
    "the proposition is justified via . ,",
    "( i ) the nuclei of most galaxies contain massive black hole and ( ii ) galaxies often merge .",
    "more importantly , all radio images of the sample of @xmath0-shaped sources show the wings and the lobes to be embedded well into the base and argues in favour of unresolved , coalescing binary agn system . in order to understand , if the @xmath0-shaped sources are indeed examples of unresolved binary agn systems , with two pairs of jets associated with two unresolved agns , several methods have been suggested , _",
    "e.g. _ an indirect hint for the presence of binary agns is using _ hst _ to identify inwardly decreasing surface brightness profiles in the galaxy .",
    "we have re - analyzed the archived snapshot _ hst _ data for 3c  52 , 3c  136.1 , 3c  223.1 , 3c  315 , 3c  403 and 3c  433 .",
    "a close inspection of the deconvolved brightness profiles in each source does not suggest a centrally depressed , nearly flat core .",
    "but is this due to obscuration of the core by the dusty disk @xcite , needs to be followed with new deep images .",
    "based on the gmrt results presented above , we conclude that earlier models do not explain the formation scenario for the @xmath0-shaped sources .",
    "only viable model is the ` alternative ' model , _",
    "i.e. _ the @xmath0-shaped sources consists of two pairs of jets , which are associated with two unresolved agns @xcite .",
    "this ` alternative ' model not only explains earlier observational results , it also explains our low frequency spectral results .",
    "the proposition also supports the small number of @xmath0-shaped sources , as the frequency of merger of two field agns is small and is definitely smaller than the number of minor merger events .",
    "hence , we believe that every @xmath0-shaped source consist of an unresolved binary agn , giving two pairs of jets corresponding to two agns . whether or not the central binary black hole can actually account for the formation of @xmath0-shaped radio galaxies mainly depends on the timescales of shrinking of separation radii and final merging of the binary system .",
    "in other words , it critically depends on the evolution and the stability of the binary system @xcite .",
    "we suggest high resolution , multi - frequency , phase - referenced very - long - baseline - interferometry ( vlbi ) imaging of @xmath0-shaped sources , in order to determine the recent active jet and investigate if these sources are example of resolved binary agn systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , we also suggest deep _ hst _ , _ chandra _ images to detect binary supermassive black holes , and a search process using the images from the vla nvss @xcite and first @xcite surveys with a goal of increasing the total number of @xmath0-shaped radio sources , thereby forming a homogeneous complete sample .",
    "additional observational results and wisdom gained from it would allow us to understand these sources in a statistical manner .",
    "we have presented the lowest frequency images of the sample of @xmath0-shaped sources at 240 and 610  mhz , and our radio spectral results have been instrumental in testing the formation scenario of these sources .",
    "the measurements presented here represent most of the database that we require for rigorously testing and understanding the formation models of these sources . based on our careful analysis and estimation of the possible systematic errors , along with the integrated radio flux densities and the spectral indices from it at several locations across each of these sources ,",
    "we show that these sources divide into following three categories :    1 .",
    "sources in which the wings are of flatter spectral indices than the active lobes , namely , 4c  12.03 , 3c  223.1 and b1059@xmath1169 .",
    "2 .   sources in which the wings and the active lobes have comparable spectral indices , namely , 3c  192 , b2  0828@xmath132 , 4c  48.29 and 3c  403 .",
    "sources in which the wings are of steeper spectral indices than the active lobes , namely , ngc  326 , 3c  52 , 3c  136.1 , 3c  315 and 3c  433 .",
    "these gmrt results do not support earlier known formation models for the @xmath0-shaped sources . while it is equally probable that the three categories , a , b & c , of sources are unrelated to one another , a single model to explain these sources is a challenge .",
    "currently , only possible model is our ` alternative ' model , _",
    "i.e. _ the @xmath0-shaped sources consists of two pairs of jets , which are associated with two unresolved agns @xcite .",
    "there is definitely a need to understand the proposed formation scenario for @xmath0-shaped sources and hence , follow - up work is necessary .",
    "future , vlbi results , together with deep _ hst _ , _ chandra _ images and results from a larger homogeneous complete sample of @xmath0-shape sources would be useful in constraining any possible formation model .",

    "<S> we present results from a study of @xmath0-shaped sources based on observations using the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) . </S>",
    "<S> these observations were motivated by our low frequency study of 3c  223.1 ( lal & rao 2005 ) , an @xmath0-shaped radio source , which showed that the wings ( or low - surface - brightness jets ) have flatter spectral indices than the active lobes ( or high - surface - brightness jets ) , a result not easily explained by most models . </S>",
    "<S> we have now obtained gmrt data at 240 and 610  mhz for almost all the known @xmath0-shaped radio sources and have studied the distribution of the spectral index across the sources . </S>",
    "<S> while the radio morphologies of all the sources at 240 and 610 mhz show the characteristic @xmath0-shape , the spectral characteristics of the @xmath0-shaped radio sources , seem to fall into three categories , namely , sources in which ( a ) the wings have flatter spectral indices than the active lobes , ( b ) the wings and the active lobes have comparable spectral indices , and ( c ) the wings have steeper spectral indices than the active lobes . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of the new observational results on the various formation models that have been proposed for @xmath0-shaped sources .    </S>",
