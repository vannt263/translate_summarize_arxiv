    "the global analyses of the free nucleon parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) are based on the asymptotic freedom of qcd , parton evolution and factorization .",
    "these features provide the justification for computing hard - processes cross - sections , schematically as @xmath0 where @xmath1s denote the scale - dependent pdfs , and @xmath2 are perturbatively computable coefficients .",
    "the factorization theorem has turned out to work extremely well with more and more different types of data included in the free proton analyses . in the case of bound nucleons factorization",
    "is not as well - established , but it has nevertheless proven to provide a very good description @xcite of the observed nuclear modifications @xmath3 in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) and drell - yan ( dy ) dilepton production involving nuclear targets . here , we summarize our recent nlo analysis of the nuclear pdfs and , in particular , their uncertainties @xcite .",
    "our analysis follows very similar pattern as most free proton analyses do :    a. * the pdfs are parametrized at an initial scale @xmath4 imposing the sum rules . * in this work we do not parametrize the absolute pdfs , but rather the @xmath5 and @xmath6 dependences of the nuclear modification factors @xmath7 on top of a fixed set of free proton pdfs : @xmath8 above @xmath9 refers to a cteq set of the free proton pdfs @xcite in the zero - mass variable flavour number scheme , and we consider three different modification factors : @xmath10 for both @xmath11 and @xmath12 valence quarks , @xmath13 for all sea quarks , and @xmath14 for gluons .",
    "b. * the nuclear pdfs are evolved to other perturbative scales @xmath15 by the dglap equations . *",
    "an efficient numerical solver for the parton evolution is an indispensable ingredient for any parton analysis , but in the case of nuclear pdfs this is even more critical as we need to repeatedly do the evolution separately for 13 different nuclei . on the other hand , the relatively low @xmath16-values spanned by the data utilized , @xmath17 , and the fact that they come as ratios @xmath3 which are more stable against small evolution inaccuracies , make such task somewhat easier .",
    "our dglap code is based on a semi - analytical method described e.g. in @xcite .",
    "c. * the cross - sections are computed using the factorization theorem . *    d. * the computed cross - sections are compared with the experimental data , and the initial parametrization is varied to establish an optimal fit to the data . * we define the best agreement as the minimum of a generalized @xmath18-function @xmath19 ^ 2 .",

    "its value is determined by minimizing @xmath29 and the final @xmath30 is thus an output of the analysis .",
    "the weight factors @xmath31 are used to amplify the importance of those data sets whose content is physically relevant , but contribution to @xmath18 would otherwize be too small to be noticed by an automated minimization .",
    "e. * the uncertainties are estimated . *",
    "besides finding the central set of parameters @xmath32 that optimally fits the data , quantifying the uncertainties stemming from the experimental errors has become an integral part of the modern pdf fits . in this work ,",
    "we employ the hessian method @xcite , which rests on a quadratic approximation @xmath33 around the vicinity of the minimum @xmath34 .",
    "non - zero off - diagonal elements in the hessian matrix @xmath35 defined above are a signal of correlations between the original fit parameters and it is useful to make a change of variables @xmath36 that diagonalizes the hessian matrix .",
    "constructing the so - called pdf error sets @xmath37 is what ultimately makes the hessian method so useful .",
    "each @xmath37 is obtained by displacing the fit parameters to the positive / negative direction along the eigenvector @xmath38 of the hessian matrix such that @xmath18 grows by a certain amount @xmath39 . using these sets , the upper and lower uncertainty of a quantity @xmath40 can be written e.g. as @xmath41 ^ 2 \\label{eq : error_best } \\\\ ( \\delta x^-)^2 & \\approx & \\sum_k \\left [ \\max\\left\\ { x(s^0)-x(s^+_k ) , x(s^0)-x(s^-_k),0 \\right\\ } \\right]^2 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 denotes the value of the quantity @xmath40 computed by the set @xmath37 and where @xmath43 is the best fit . requiring each data set to remain close to its 90%-confidence range",
    ", we end up with a choice @xmath44 .",
    "r0.7        we briefly go through the main results from the present analysis , starting with fig .  [ fig : pbpdfs ] where we plot the obtained modifications for lead at two scales making their scale - dependence thereby clearly visible .",
    "it should be noticed that even a rather large uncertainty band at small-@xmath5 gluons shrinks in the scale evolution  a clear prediction of the dglap approach that might be testable in the future colliders .    as the dis and dy data constitute the major part of the available experimental data we display in fig .",
    "[ fig : rf2a1 ] some representative examples of the measured nuclear modifications with respect to deuterium , @xmath45 for different nuclei compared with the eps09 .",
    "the shaded blue bands denote the uncertainty propagated from the 30 eps09 error sets and , as should be emphasized , their size is comparable to the experimental errors backing up our choice for the @xmath39 .     at @xmath47 from hkn07  @xcite , nds  @xcite and this work , eps09 @xcite .",
    "right : the computed @xmath48 for inclusive pion production compared with the phenix @xcite and star @xcite data multiplied by @xmath49 @xmath50 , respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ]   at @xmath47 from hkn07  @xcite , nds  @xcite and this work , eps09 @xcite .",

[ fig : phenix ] .",
    "evidently , the shape of the spectrum  which in our calculation is a reflection of the similar shape in @xmath54  gets well reproduced by eps09 .",
    "let us mention that the shape is practically independent of the fragmentation functions used in the calculation  modern sets like @xcite all give equal results .",
    "figure  [ fig : phenix ] also presents a comparison of eps09 gluon modifications @xmath55 with the earlier nlo analyses .",
    "the significant scatter of the curves highlight the difficulty of pinning down the nuclear modifications from the dis and dy data alone  especially the behaviour of hkn07 looks different .",
    "consequently , also the predictions for pion @xmath48 differ significantly as is easily seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : phenix ] .",
    "this is actually good news as this type of data , especially with better statistics , may eventually discriminate between different proposed gluon modifications .",
    "attention should be paid to the experimentally observed scaling - violations and to the fact that the dglap dynamics reproduces them well .",
    "most cleanly such effects are visible e.g from the small-@xmath5 structure function ratios versus @xmath16 , of which fig .",
    "[ fig : rf2_slopes ] shows an example .      in summary , the very good agreement with the experimental data @xmath56 found  especially the correct description of the scale - breaking effects  we argue , is compelling evidence for the applicability of collinear factorization in nuclear environment .",
    "in addition to the best fit , we release @xcite 30 npdf error - sets for practical use , encoding the neighborhood of the @xmath18 minimum . although not discussed here , we have also performed the leading - order counterpart of the nlo analysis as we want to provide the uncertainty tools also for this widely - used framework .",
    "although the best - fit quality is very similar both in lo and nlo , the uncertainty bands become smaller when going to higher order .",
