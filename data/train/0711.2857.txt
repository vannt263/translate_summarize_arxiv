    "classical cepheids are the most important primary distance indicators",
    ". one of the key issues concerning the use of cepheids as distance indicators is their dependence on chemical composition .",
    "empirical tests seem to suggest that metal - rich cepheids are , at fixed period , brighter than metal - poor ones , either over the entire period range @xcite or for periods shorter than @xmath4 days @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "distance estimates based on the near - infrared surface brightness method indicate that the slope of the period - luminosity ( @xmath5 ) relation might be the same for magellanic and galactic cepheids @xcite . however , the impact of the projection factor @xmath3 on the cepheid distances is still debated @xcite .",
    "early theoretical predictions based on linear pulsation models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predicted a mild metallicity effect , while nonlinear convective models @xcite showed that the metallicity affects both the zero - point and the slope of the @xmath5 relations .",
    "this effect is more evident in the optical bands and it is nonlinear when moving from metal - poor ( @xmath6 ) to super metal - rich ( @xmath7 ) structures .",
    "current predictions also suggest a turnover across solar metallicity ( @xmath8 @xmath90.02 ) due to the correlated increase in he content @xcite .",
    "three approaches are adopted to calibrate the cepheid pl relations : cluster distances , trigonometric parallaxes and baade - wesselink ( bw ) method .",
    "parallaxes based on cepheids in open clusters and associations have been widely adopted to calibrate the pl relations @xcite , but @xcite found a systematic difference with other methods .",
    "accurate cepheid parallaxes have been provided by @xcite and by @xcite using the fine guide sensor on board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "they measured the distance of several galactic cepheids with average relative errors of @xmath10% .",
    "the bw method appears to be a robust approach , but some assumptions need to be investigated @xcite .",
    "the value of the projection factor ( @xmath3 ) , i.e. the parameter adopted to transform radial into pulsation velocity , is still controversial @xcite .",
    "the typical value used in the literature is @xmath11 @xcite , but period - dependent values are also adopted @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath3-factor of @xmath0 cephei , @xmath12 , measured by @xcite , using the hst parallax , agrees quite well with the predicted value @xcite .    although , several cepheids are binaries dynamical mass estimates are only available for a handful objects @xcite .",
    "current mass estimates rely either on evolutionary or on pulsation prescriptions @xcite and we are still facing the long - standing problem of the `` cepheid mass discrepancy '' @xcite .",
    "evolutionary masses are systematically larger than pulsation masses @xcite .",
    "theoretical fits of cepheid light curves provide robust constraints on their intrinsic parameters and distances @xcite .",
    "this approach , up to now , has only been applied to bump cepheids .",
    "we present , for the first time , a simultaneous fit of optical / nir light , radial velocity , and angular diameter variations of the prototype @xmath0 cephei .",
    "we selected this object because accurate measurements of light , radius , velocity curves , and of the @xmath3-factor are available and its geometric distance is known with an accuracy of 4% ( 273@xmath13 * ? ? ?",
    "the optical ( @xmath14 ) and the near - infrared ( nir ) @xmath15-band light curve were collected by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "we selected these light curves because both the shape and the amplitude in the optical bands depend on surface temperature and radius variation , while in @xmath15-band the dependence on temperature is significantly reduced .",
    "the radial velocity data were collected by @xcite , while the angular diameter and the projection factor by @xcite .",
    "the observables for @xmath0 cephei are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the adopted theoretical framework is based on a nonlinear radial pulsation code , including the nonlocal and time - dependent treatment of turbulent convection ( @xcite . the system of nonlinear equations is closed using a free parameter , @xmath16 , that is proportional to the mixing length parameter .",
    "changes in the @xmath16 parameter affect , as expected , both the limit cycle stability ( pulsation amplitudes ) and the topology of the instability strip @xcite .",
    "similar approaches for the treatment of convective transport have been developed by @xcite , and @xcite .    in order to provide a detailed fit of @xmath0 cephei pulsation properties we adopted three different metal abundances , ranging from @xmath17 to @xmath18 , to account for current spectroscopic measurements @xcite",
    "that indicate a metal abundance close to solar ( @xmath19=-0.01\\pm0.06 $ ] ) .",
    "recent spectroscopic measurements of solar heavy element abundances show a significant decrease when compared with previous estimates , and indeed the ratio between heavy - elements and hydrogen , @xmath20 , decreased from 0.023 @xcite to 0.0177 @xcite or to 0.0171 @xcite .",
    "this implies that the surface heavy element abundance of the sun decreased from @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "the surface he abundance of the sun according to helioseismological estimates , combined with these latest solar metallicity estimates , is @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "however , the new solar photospheric abundances are at odds with helioseismology measurements @xcite and , at present , solar models are constructed by adopting protosolar helium abundances ranging from @xmath24 to @xmath25 and heavy metal abundances ranging from @xmath26 to @xmath27 . according to these evidence we adopted @xmath18 and @xmath28 ( see table  2 ) . once the chemical composition was fixed , we constructed a sequence of isoperiodic pulsation models , by adopting the pulsation relation ( the relation connecting the period to stellar mass , luminosity , and effective temperature ) provided by @xcite .",
    "we selected the fundamental models with periods within 2% of the observed period ( p=5.3663 days , fernie 1995 ) and pulsationally unstable according to the analytical relations for the instability strip boundaries provided by @xcite .",
    "for each mass value , we fixed the lower limit to the input luminosity according to the mass - luminosity ( ml ) relation given by @xcite and the upper limit according to mild overshooting predictions , i.e. by adding to the quoted value a fixed luminosity excess i.e. @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the bolometric light curves were transformed into the ubvijk photometric bands by adopting the model atmospheres provided by @xcite .",
    "we constructed a sequence of models at fixed chemical composition ( @xmath18 , @xmath28 ) and by assuming steps in mass and in effective temperature of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the comparison between theory and observations indicate that a model with @xmath32 , and @xmath33 accounts for the shape of the light curves and for the secondary bump located on the decreasing branch of the radial velocity curve ( @xmath34 ) . to further improve the agreement between predicted and empirical observables , we constructed a new sequence of models by adopting smaller steps in mass and in effective temperature , namely @xmath35,@xmath36 . for every model in this sequence",
    ", the mixing length parameter was changed from @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "note that an increase in @xmath16 causes a decrease in the pulsation driving , and in turn a decrease in the limit cycle amplitudes .",
    "data plotted in the left panels of fig . 1",
    "show that the best fit model ( @xmath39 ) accounts for the optical and nir light curves , but both the radial velocity ( @xmath40 ) and the radius ( @xmath41 ) amplitudes are systematically smaller than the observed ones .",
    "this discrepancy can only be removed by decreasing the @xmath3-factor from 1.27 to the barely plausible value of @xmath42 . to further constrain the impact of the adopted chemical composition on the limit cycle stability",
    ", we constructed a new sequence of models by using the same metal abundance and a lower he content ( @xmath43 ) . the new best fit model ( see table  2 and the middle panels of fig .",
    "1 ) accounts for optical and nir light curves and better reproduces radial velocity ( @xmath44 ) and radius ( @xmath45 ) variations .",
    "the predicted @xmath46-band light curve presents a mild discrepancy along the rising branch .",
    "however , the discrepancy on luminosity amplitudes is smaller than @xmath47 . in order to verify the occurrence of a degeneracy in the input parameters",
    ", we also computed a new series of models by using a lower he content , ( @xmath48 , see table  2 and right panels of fig .",
    "interestingly enough , velocity and radius amplitudes predicted by new best fit - model are at least @xmath49 smaller than observed . once again",
    ", a reasonable fit between theory and observations would require a barely plausible @xmath3-factor ( @xmath50 ) .    in order to test how the fits depend on metallicity , we computed a new series of models by adopting @xmath51 , and he content of @xmath52 ( see table  2 ) .",
    "data plotted in the left panels of fig . 2 show that the new best fit model agrees reasonably well with the observations .",
    "however , the discrepancy in the radial velocity is @xmath53 and in the radius amplitude is @xmath49 .",
    "this finding indicates that a decrease in the metal content improves the agreement between theory and observations .",
    "therefore , we constructed two new sequences of pulsation models by adopting a more metal - poor chemical composition ( @xmath17 ) and two different he contents ( @xmath54 ) . the new best fit models ( see table  2 , middle and right panels of fig .",
    "2 ) account quite well for luminosity , radial velocity , and radius variations .",
    "a marginal difference between theory and observations is still present .",
    "however , the discrepancy is on average smaller than @xmath55 for @xmath43 and systematically larger for @xmath48 ( see table  2 ) .",
    "the comparison between theory and observations brings forward several findings . _",
    "i ) _ the more metal - poor ( @xmath17 ) best fit models account for the observed light and velocity amplitudes at a level better than @xmath1 and the average discrepancy over the entire cycle is @xmath56 ( see table  2 ) . _ ii ) _ the fit of the radial velocity curve is very sensitive to the input parameters . the small  bump  located along the decreasing branch ( @xmath57 ) mainly depends on the mass value , and it is independent of the chemical composition . moreover",
    ", the radial velocity amplitude strongly depends on the he content .",
    "for example , an increase / decrease of @xmath58% in he content causes , at z=0.02 , an increase on the amplitude discrepancy of at least @xmath59 . the more metal - rich best fit models ( y=0.28 , 0.25 ) to properly fit the velocity amplitude would require @xmath3-factor values that are at least @xmath60% smaller than the empirical measurement by @xcite .",
    "therefore , they do not pass the empirical validation .",
    "_ iii ) _ predicted radius variations are at least @xmath2 smaller than observed while the average discrepancy over the entire curve is never smaller than @xmath61 for all the adopted chemical compositions .",
    "the mismatch is mainly caused by the few points located across the phases of minimum radius .",
    "we do not have a firm explanation for this discrepancy .",
    "these phases are the most rapid ones along the pulsation cycle and the radial displacements of the outermost layers might be affected either by shock waves or by velocity gradients @xcite .",
    "this critical point deserves further investigations , since radius measurements depend on the adopted distance and on limb darkening correction , but they are affected neither by the interstellar extinction nor by the @xmath3-factor . therefore , they can play a key role in constraining theoretical predictions . _",
    "iv ) _ the model with @xmath62 and @xmath63 provides the optimum fit to all observables ( except for the only three magnitudes on the rising branch of the v light curve ) .",
    "this finding taken at face value indicates that the he content might be 8% smaller than typically assumed to construct galactic cepheid models .",
    "the metal content of @xmath0 cephei seems to be @xmath64 dex more metal - poor than suggested by spectroscopy , but this constraint is less robust .",
    "note that the @xmath3-factor adopted for this model ( @xmath65 ) agrees quite well with the measurement by mrand et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . _",
    "v ) _ the best fit models present a luminosity excess ( see column 7 in table  2 ) that ranges from @xmath66 ( z=0.01 , y=0.26 ) to 0.17 ( z=0.02 , y=0.24 ) .",
    "these values are between the luminosities predicted by a canonical ml relation @xcite and those predicted by mild core overshooting ml relation ( @xmath67 , chiosi et al .",
    "1993 ) .    as a further validation of the current approach",
    ", we also estimated the absolute distance to @xmath0 cephei using the best fit models that passed the empirical validations . in order to provide a plausible estimate of the errors affecting distance determinations we assumed the largest uncertainties on the adopted input parameters : @xmath35 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 . by accounting for the entire error budget the intrinsic uncertainties on current distance determinations",
    "is about @xmath71 for photometric distances and @xmath72 pc for the distances derived from the fit of radius variations .",
    "distance estimates based on the apparent distance moduli provided by the fit of both optical and nir light curves and on the reddening law provided by @xcite are listed in columns 6 and 7 of table  3 .",
    "the comparison with the hst parallax shows that distances based on @xmath14-bands agree at the @xmath73 level , while those based on the @xmath74-bands are within @xmath1 level .",
    "errors either in the photometric zero - points or in the adopted color - temperature transformations or in the extinction law account for the difference in the distance determinations based on light curves .",
    "moreover , the occurrence of a circumstellar envelope ( cse ) around @xmath0 cephei @xcite could also affect the reddening corrections due to the different relative distribution of the absorbing grains around the star , compared to typical interstellar medium distribution .",
    "independent distance determinations follow from comparing the observed angular diameter variations by @xcite with the radius curves from four different models .",
    "the distances ( table  3 , column 8) agree well with each other and are on average only 5% ( @xmath75 ) larger than the trigonometric distance .",
    "the comparison of observed and model radii is in principle a powerful method to derive cepheid distances , since it is independent of the assumption on the @xmath3-factor and on interstellar extinction .",
    "note that an increase in the distance would also imply an increase in the @xmath3-factor , since at fixed radial velocity amplitude , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the angular diameter amplitude .",
    "finally we mention that the mean radii predicted by the best fit models match within @xmath55 the empirical estimate based on the angular diameter provided by me06 ( @xmath78 ) , by assuming the hst parallax .",
