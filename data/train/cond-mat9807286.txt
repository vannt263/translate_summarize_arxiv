    "quantum dots have been intensively investigated both experimentally and theoretically @xcite in recent years . in this paper , we present a theoretical study of the correlations of conductance peaks and of transmission phases that have been observed in recent experiments on quantum dots in the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "quantum dots are small islands of electrons that are only a few hundred nanometers in size and typically contain a few hundred electrons .",
    "the spectrum of a quantum dot is determined by the coulomb interaction of the electrons and by the external electrostatic confining potential .",
    "the confining potential and hence the size and shape of a quantum dot can be controlled by external gates .",
    "this makes quantum dots an ideal tool for studying the properties of finite systems of interacting fermions .",
    "experimentally , the spectra of quantum dots have been measured using optical ( far  infrared ) spectroscopy and/or transport experiments . in the latter case ,",
    "the quantum dot is coupled via tunnel barriers to external leads .",
    "the conductance measured at a finite drain  source voltage reveals the excitation spectrum of the dot whereas the linear conductance yields the addition spectrum of the quantum dot .",
    "both the excitation and the addition spectrum are dominated by the classical coulomb blockade effect : large conductance peaks are observed when the dot potential is tuned in such a way that the number of electrons on the dot can fluctuate without any cost in energy .",
    "these peaks are nearly periodic in the gate voltage on the dot . at consecutive peaks the number of electrons on the dot changes by one . at values of the gate voltage located between the positions of the conductance peaks , electron transport through the dot",
    "requires a large charging energy .",
    "hence , the current between conductance peaks is strongly suppressed , the remaining current being mostly due to virtual tunneling processes ( co  tunneling regime ) @xcite .    typically , metallic quantum dots have such a large density of states that the coulomb blockade oscillations can be described by classical theory which ignores the discreteness of the spectrum .",
    "the situation is different in semiconductor dots . here ,",
    "the mean single  particle level spacing @xmath1 can be larger than the temperature @xmath2 .",
    "the regime @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the strength of the coupling to the leads , is the resonant tunneling regime . in this regime , each conductance peak is mediated by a single quantum state of the dot .",
    "the peak height of the conductance resonance is a direct signature of the wave function of the resonant state .",
    "some years ago , jalabert , stone , and alhassid developed a statistical theory of the coulomb blockade @xcite in the resonant tunneling regime . in order to explain strong fluctuations of the peak heights of neighboring conductance resonances",
    ", they assumed that the eigenstates of a quantum dot can be described by random matrix theory . according to this theory",
    "no correlations are to be expected for the peak heights of neighboring peaks .",
    "moreover , the distribution of peak heights is predicted to be universal , and only determined by the fundamental symmetries of the system .",
    "while two recent experiments @xcite appeared to have confirmed these predictions , a more careful examination of the experimental data casts some doubt on the validity of random matrix theory in describing the physics of quantum dots .",
    "deviations from the predictions of random matrix theory include the appearance of 4 - 5 correlated transmission peaks @xcite , non wigner - dyson related distribution of conductance peak spacing @xcite , and reduced sensitivity to magnetic flux @xcite .",
    "even stronger correlations have been reported in very recent experiments using a quantum dot embedded in an aharonov - bohm ring @xcite where both the peak heights and the phase of the transmission amplitude could be measured .",
    "strong correlations within sequences of more than 10 resonances were found .    in the experiments of refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath2 was approximately @xmath5 . when the resonant tunneling limit @xmath6 is not fully met , also neighboring eigenstates around the fermi energy ( rather than only a single state )",
    "contribute to the conductance peak . extending the random matrix theory description to the regime @xmath7",
    ", correlations in the peak height were found @xcite .",
    "those temperature - induced correlations seem sufficiently strong to account for sequences of up to 5 correlated peaks as reported in ref .",
    "however , temperature alone can clearly be ruled out as the source of the much stronger correlations found in ref .",
    "a mechanism different from and acting in addition to temperature must be the origin of these correlations .    in this paper",
    "we propose such a mechanism .",
    "our model involves certain geometry - specific assumptions and is therefore restricted in generality and universality .",
    "nevertheless it may still pertain to experiments on nearly integrable ballistic dots ( cf .",
    "section [ condosc ] ) .",
    "our mechanism is a synthesis of two approaches developed earlier @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a scenario was described for peak correlations at _ vanishing temperature_. it was argued that deformation of the confining potential of the dot generically gives rise to avoided crossings of the single  particle levels on the dot . as a result of such crossings one and",
    "the same eigenstate of the dot may dominate a sequence of neighboring conductance peaks @xcite and thereby cause correlations .",
    "although several arguments in support of this mechanism were given @xcite , a quantitative study of the resulting correlations has not been presented yet . a different line of thought",
    "was pursued in ref .",
    "@xcite . that paper aimed at explaining the `` phase lapse '' observed in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite ( a different theoretical discussion of the phase lapse was presented in ref .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the phase ",
    "lapse behavior as well as strong _ finite temperature _ correlations of conductance peaks arise if the dot supports one particularly well conducting state . this state would dominate a sequence of conductance peaks provided it remained within an energy interval of order @xmath8 around the fermi energy .    here",
    "we study peak  height correlations and the transmission phase in quantum dots taking a deformed harmonic oscillator as a specific example . using this model ,",
    "we show that deformation of the confining potential leads to peak  height correlations , in keeping with the arguments of ref .",
    "we identify those eigenstates of the quantum dot that are most strongly coupled to the external leads and which , therefore , support the bulk of the current through the dot .",
    "height correlations are strongest for sequences of resonances mediated by such states .",
    "we also investigate the influence of temperature on the correlations . as expected from the studies in ref .",
    "@xcite , we find that temperature leads to a marked increase of the correlations .",
    "combining the effect of deformation and of temperature , we obtain sequences of up to 30 conductance resonances with similar transmission phases and similar peak heights . we demonstrate that this same mechanism may also account for the phase  lapse behavior observed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we introduce a model for a deformed quantum dot and describe how correlations can arise . in section 3",
    "we calculate the conductance with the help of a master equation . in section 4",
    "we investigate the transmission phase .",
    "this phase can be measured in aharonov ",
    "bohm type experiments containing a quantum dot .",
    "the last section gives a summary and a discussion of the limitations of our model .",
    "the confining potential of a quantum dot is often defined electrostatically in terms of a split gate . as depicted in figure  1 ,",
    "this is an arrangement of electrodes on the surface of a heterostructure .",
    "when a negative bias is applied to the gates , the two  dimensional electron gas located some 100 nm or so beneath the electrodes will be depleted .",
    "the barriers through which electrons can tunnel between the leads and the dot are denoted by @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "a voltage @xmath11 applied to the plunger gate @xmath12 controls the chemical potential on the dot .",
    "a change of @xmath11 not only changes the number of electrons on the dot but also distorts the confining potential of the two  dimensional electron gas in a substantial way , causing a deformation of the quantum dot @xcite .",
    "we consider the standard hamiltonian @xmath13 for a quantum dot coupled to leads , containing the hamiltonians @xmath14 and @xmath15 of the left and right leads , respectively , the hamiltonian of the isolated quantum dot @xmath16 , and the hamiltonian @xmath17 for tunneling between the leads and the dot , @xmath18 here , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the energies and @xmath21 and @xmath22 the annihilation operators for single  particle states in the leads and in the dot , respectively . for the coulomb interaction on the quantum dot we use the constant interaction model with",
    "@xmath23 the number of electrons on the quantum dot .",
    "the tunneling matrix elements @xmath24 involve the overlap of wave functions in the leads and in the dot and are given below .",
    "we model the confining potential as an anisotropic harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "a harmonic potential has been used previously in studies of quantum dots @xcite and , at least for small dots , is believed to be a fair approximation to the true confining potential .",
    "although we use a specific model , most of our conclusions apply to any sufficiently smooth confining potential for which the hamiltonian is nearly integrable .",
    "then , the transverse and longitudinal modes in the dot are nearly decoupled , cf .",
    "( [ spec ] ) .",
    "this condition is met when the matrix elements of the perturbation violating integrability are smaller than the mean single  particle level spacing . however",
    ", even mild disorder or boundary roughness violating this condition will modify our picture considerably .",
    "the energy eigenvalues @xmath20 for the quantum numbers @xmath25 are given by @xmath26 to describe the deformation , we assume that the oscillator frequency @xmath27 in the transverse direction @xmath28 depends linearly on the gate voltage @xmath11 while the frequency @xmath29 in the longitudinal @xmath30direction is held fixed .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 relates the overall depth of the dot s potential to the gate voltage .",
    "the constants @xmath32 and @xmath33 determine the number of electrons on the dot at zero deformation .",
    "the dependence of the single  particle levels on the gate voltage is shown in figure  [ shell ] .",
    "the shell structure of the isotropic harmonic oscillator ( @xmath34 ) is clearly visible .",
    "it survives for small values of @xmath11 but is eventually destroyed by deformation .",
    "each shell @xmath35 is characterized by non ",
    "negative integer quantum numbers @xmath36 . in each shell , there are levels depending weakly ( strongly ) on @xmath11 , characterized by large ( small ) values of @xmath37 and small ( large ) values of @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "these are referred to as `` flat levels '' and `` steep levels '' , respectively .",
    "a small deviation from integrability will change the level crossings shown in figure  [ shell ] into avoided crossings . for nearly integrable systems ,",
    "the wave functions retain their character across avoided crossings .",
    "flat levels are particularly stable , their wave functions change little with deformation ( or gate voltage ) and remain self ",
    "similar even after several avoided crossings @xcite .",

    "the integration extends in the @xmath28direction and @xmath44 is arbitrary but must be located within the barrier @xcite . we restrict ourselves to the case of a single transverse channel in each lead .",
    "the nodes of the wave functions of flat ( steep ) levels with large @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) are predominantly carried by the x  component ( y  component , respectively ) .",
    "thus , the wave functions of flat levels extend much further into the barrier region and have considerably larger matrix elements @xmath45 than those of the steep levels .",
    "this important property is illustrated in figure  [ over ] .",
    "it has immediate consequences for the conductance at finite temperature : the very same single ",
    "particle state can dominate different coulomb blockade resonances seen at different values of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "we now explain this feature qualitatively , postponing a detailed discussion to later sections .    at low temperature ( @xmath46 ) and for small bias voltage",
    ", the transmission through the dot can be qualitatively obtained from the mean  field approximation for the dot spectrum . in this approximation ,",
    "each single  particle energy @xmath47 is replaced by the effective value @xmath48 @xcite . according to koopmans theorem , @xmath49 is the energy needed to add an electron in state @xmath50 to the dot , whereas the excitation energy at fixed electron number is given by the difference of the corresponding two effective energies . because of the coulomb interaction ,",

    "avoided crossings of single  particle levels result in avoided crossings of the effective levels , in spite of this gap @xcite .",
    "a coulomb blockade resonance occurs , and the number of electrons on the dot changes by one , whenever an effective single  particle level crosses the fermi energy @xmath52 of the reservoirs .",

    "the distance between adjacent resonances is @xmath54 . without level crossings ,",
    "different resonances correspond to different single  particle levels . in the presence of level crossings ,",
    "the situation changes .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ avoid ] which displays the gap between the filled levels below and the empty ones above @xmath52 .",
    "resonances occur at gate voltages @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "suppose a flat level @xmath57 ( dashed ) crosses @xmath52 at @xmath58 .",
    "if there is an avoided crossing of @xmath57 with a steep level @xmath59 from a higher shell between @xmath58 and @xmath60 , level @xmath57 is pushed above @xmath52 while level @xmath59 is immersed into the fermi sea . at @xmath60 the flat level @xmath57 crosses @xmath52 again , causing another resonance to occur .",
    "the mechanism works again between @xmath60 and @xmath56 where another steep level @xmath61 intersects with @xmath57 .",
    "since flat levels keep their wave functions after avoided crossings , the resonances at @xmath62 and @xmath56 all carry the @xmath63 single  particle wave function .",
    "this mechanism gives rise to strong correlations of the properties ( peak height and transmission phase ) of several resonances .",
    "however , it leads to strong correlations only if there is _ one and only one _ crossing of the flat level @xmath57 with a steep level within subsequent intervals @xmath64 . if  on average  there is less than one ( more than one ) crossing , the level @xmath57 will eventually be pulled down below ( up above ) the fermi energy and will become irrelevant for the behavior of coulomb blockade resonances .",
    "so far , we have focussed attention on the resonant tunneling regime @xmath65 where only the level @xmath66 the fermi energy determines the properties of the resonance .",
    "essential modifications arise for finite temperatures @xmath67 . here ,",
    "also levels at a distance @xmath68 from @xmath52 contribute to the resonance . since the flat levels are coupled to the leads much more strongly than the steep ones , the presence of a flat level at a distance @xmath68 from @xmath52 suffices for it to dominate the resonance .",
    "long sequences of correlated resonances may occur if repeated avoided crossings cause a flat level @xmath57 to stay sufficiently close to @xmath52 over a sufficiently long range of @xmath11 values .",
    "this is the picture we investigate quantitatively for the case of an anharmonic oscillator in the sequel .",
    "the picture suggests that the correlations of consecutive coulomb blockade resonances will increase with temperature .",
    "the number of intersection points of a flat level ( @xmath69 ) with steep levels from higher shells can be determined from eq .",
    "( [ spec ] ) .",
    "the total number of crossings of the flat level occurring in the range @xmath70 is given by @xmath71 the number of steep levels from higher shells increases with deformation and causes @xmath72 to increase , too , until it diverges for the unphysical situation of extreme deformation @xmath73 . in order to have one crossing within an interval @xmath74 we require @xmath75 .",
    "this condition yields the value of @xmath11 where maximal correlations between coulomb blockade resonances should occur .",
    "we estimate the number @xmath76 of resonances for which the distance between the flat level @xmath77 and the fermi energy is less than one level spacing and obtain @xmath78 with a deformation @xmath79 .",
    "in this section we calculate the conductance @xmath80 of a quantum dot with the single  particle spectrum ( [ spec ] ) in linear response .",
    "we use the master equation @xcite . in the coulomb blockade regime , maxima in @xmath80 occur for values of @xmath11 where the configurations with @xmath81 and @xmath82 electrons on the dot are degenerate .",

    "the phase behaves less regularly , with an increase by @xmath0 or less at and an immediate phase lapse near the resonances . between resonances",
    "the phase remains virtually constant .    to interpret our results",
    ", we consider first the phase @xmath154 at resonance .",
    "the identical behavior of @xmath154 at all resonances in figure  [ phase](a ) reflects the fact that at each resonance , the transmission through the dot is dominated by the strongly coupled level @xmath57 .",
    "this is the same mechanism as in the sequence of strong conductance peaks shown in figure  [ conduct](a ) .",
    "the more erratic phase behavior seen in figure  [ phase](b ) is the result of the interplay of various levels of the dot .",
    "the regular behavior of the phase lapse between adjacent resonances is also due to the dominance of the flat level . at finite temperature",
    "the flat level @xmath57 has a finite probability of being either occupied or empty and , thus , may contribute to both an electron  like and a hole  like cotunneling process .",
    "the contribution of both processes to the transmission amplitude through the dot is @xmath160 \\label{cotun}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first ( second ) term represents the electron  like ( hole  like ) contribution , respectively . as the gate voltage @xmath161 scans the @xmath162 valley ( i.e. varies from @xmath163 to @xmath164 ) , the sign of @xmath165 reverses , leading to a phase lapse .",
    "the same conclusion has previously been reached in ref .",
    "@xcite ; an interpretation in terms of scattering theory has been given in ref .",
    "if @xmath57 is far away from the fermi energy ( on the scale of @xmath8 ) either the particle  like or the hole ",
    "like process will dominate , and the phase lapse moves from the valley towards the resonance , as depicted in figure [ phase](b ) .",
    "we emphasize that the phase lapse between resonances is a genuine interaction effect . indeed , the interaction @xmath51 is needed to keep the flat level close to the fermi energy for a long sequence of resonances . for non",
    " interacting particles ( @xmath166 ) the transmission amplitude at different resonances would be dominated by different single  particle levels . in the same limit , the cotunneling amplitude ( [ cotun ] ) would reduce to a single , temperature  independent term .",
    "the phases of the transmission amplitude in consecutive valleys would not be correlated , and there would be no systematic phase lapse between resonances .",
    "we also note that the systematic phase lapse occurs only at finite temperature . at zero temperature a flat level could only contribute to either particle  like or hole  like cotunneling .",
    "since the first measurements on quantum dots in aharonov - bohm interference devices were reported , many aspects of phase  coherent transport through quantum dots have been understood theoretically .",
    "however , one of the most striking features , the strong correlations of the transmission phases in sequences of many resonances , has long withstood a satisfactory theoretical explanation .",
    "earlier attempts @xcite to solve the problem could account for short sequences but not for the sequences of more than 10 resonances found experimentally .    in this paper we have demonstrated the viability of a mechanism , based on a synthesis of the ideas proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , that gives rise to long sequences of correlated peak heights and transmission phases .",
    "we have used several approximations , the most central one being that the confining potential defining the dot is `` almost '' integrable .",
    "more precisely , both the deviation from integrability and the disorder must constitute a perturbation which is small on the scale of the mean single  particle level spacing .",
    "our model shares many features of the ballistic quantum dots employed in some experiments @xcite and may account semiquantitatively for some of the experimental observations .",
    "nevertheless , our analysis naturally falls short of providing a complete and universal framework which could account for the combined effect of disorder and interaction on correlations in transmission experiments .",
    "we have used the following specific conditions and assumptions : ( i ) among the eigenstates of the quantum dot , some must be coupled more strongly to the leads than others .",
    "this assumption is met by a model which is nearly integrable , as is the case for our parabolic confining potential .",
    "this potential renders @xmath167 good quantum numbers for all values of @xmath11 . of all levels in a shell , the level with @xmath168 is most strongly coupled to the leads .",
    "( ii ) changes in the gate voltage induce deformations of the dot boundary such that the potential is deformed in the transverse @xmath28direction .",
    "this assumption guarantees that in each shell , the level with @xmath169 is flat , i.e. , stays close to the fermi energy over a wide range of @xmath11values .",
    "( iii ) on average there is one crossing of the flat level with one other level per unit interval .",
    "this interval is defined by the change in @xmath11 needed to add an extra electron to the dot .",
    "( iv ) the temperature is sufficiently high to produce sufficiently long sequences of correlated resonances .",
    "the minimum temperature required by this condition depends both on the distance of the most strongly coupled level from the fermi energy , and on the relative strength of the coupling of that level to the leads .",
    "with increasing temperature the correlations become more robust .",
    "strong boundary deformations leading to strongly chaotic classical motion within the dot , or strong disorder in the dot are likely to destroy the correlations altogether since they generically do not allow for the existence of eigenstates that are particularly well coupled to external leads . in this sense , the correlations proposed in the present paper are _ non - universal in origin_. this conclusion agrees with the observation of weak peak correlations in the strongly deformed dots of ref .",
    "@xcite as compared with the strong correlations found in the experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our ideas may be checked experimentally on dots that are not embedded in an ab device but are coupled directly to leads .",
    "this setup does not allow for tests of phase correlations but provides a convenient setup for measuring conductance peak correlations .",
    "the conductance of a dot with a regular ( rectangular ) lithographic shape has been measured by simmel et _ al .",
    "these authors did indeed find a sequence of more than 10 strong peaks with very similar peak heights .",
    "in the same sweep they also observe envelopes of smaller peaks very similar to our results in figure  [ conduct ] . to test our picture further ,",
    "it would be illuminating to perform a similar two  terminal conductance experiment with leads attached at two sides of the dot which form an angle of 90 degrees . here , a reduction of the correlations is to be expected",
    ". it would also be interesting to compare two setups , one with a plunger gate and the other with a backgate configuration . in the latter case",
    "the potential deformation is reduced .",
    "this should suppress our correlation mechanism .",
