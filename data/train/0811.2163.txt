    "lloyd , petrosian & mallozzi ( 2000 ) have established that the 251000 mev fluence @xmath4 of bright batse gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) is strongly correlated with the photon energy @xmath5 at which peaks the burst @xmath1 spectral energy distribution .",
    "more recently , sakamoto et al ( 2008 ) have shown that 83 swift - bat and hete-2 bursts display a @xmath6 correlation , with the burst fluence measured at 15150 kev , while ghirlanda et al ( 2008 ) report @xmath7 for 76 bursts ( with known redshifts ) , the burst fluence being calculated in the 1 kev10 mev range ( i.e. bolometric ) .",
    "lloyd et al ( 2000 ) found that the 8 grbs with redshifts known at that time are not standard candles and , thus , the @xmath8 correlation is not due to cosmological effects but is , most likely , intrinsic . in that venue ,",
    "amati et al ( 2000 ) have shown that the intrinsic peak energy @xmath0 and the isotropic - equivalent burst output @xmath2 at @xmath9 kev are correlated , @xmath10 , for a set of 9 bursts with known redshifts ( most of which are among those used by lloyd et al 2000 ) .",
    "later , amati ( 2006 ) found that @xmath11 for a set of 41 grbs , while ghirlanda et al ( 2008 ) arrive at @xmath12 for 76 bursts .",
    "the lack of bursts with a high fluence and average / low peak energy bursts in the @xmath13 correlation is , evidently , not due to selection effects ( i.e. at least half of that correlation is real ) , with the thresholds for burst triggering and measuring the peak energy possibly affecting only bursts with a high peak energy and low / average fluence .",
    "ghirlanda et al ( 2008 ) and nava et al ( 2008 ) investigate this possibility and conclude that selection effects are negligible for pre - swift bursts but do truncate the distribution of swift bursts in the @xmath8 plane .",
    "however , as the range of peak energies of swift bursts is much narrower than that of the entire sample , they conclude that the @xmath8 is not an artifact of selection effects .",
    "the simplest explanation of the relation is that it arises from viewing geometry and/or relativistic effects .",
    "such an explanation is generic , i.e. it does not make use of a certain mechanism for the production of the grb .    in the former framework ,",
    "grbs arise from narrow jets seen at various angles @xmath14 , the intrinsic burst emission being relativistically boosted by a factor @xmath15^{-1 } \\simeq 2/(\\gamma \\theta^2)$ ] , with @xmath16 being the jet lorentz factor and the viewing angle @xmath14 being larger than the both the jet opening and the relativistic beaming angle @xmath17 .",
    "relativistic beaming of the comoving frame emission ( denoted with primed quantities ) implies that the observed burst peak energy is @xmath18 and the inferred isotropic - equivalent grb output is @xmath19 ( the factor @xmath20 arising from @xmath21 for angular beaming and @xmath22 for boost of photon energy ) .",
    "hence , in this scenario , the simplest expectation is that @xmath23 , assuming that the comoving - frame peak energy @xmath24 and grb output @xmath25 are _ universal _",
    "( i.e. they have same values for all bursts ) or , at least , uncorrelated .",
    "toma , yamazaki & nakamura ( 2005 ) obtain the @xmath23 analytical expectation in a more sophisticated way ( for a typical grb spectrum ) but their numerical integration of the doppler - boosted emission yields @xmath26 for observer offsets that are comparable to ( but larger than ) the jet opening , which corresponds to higher energies @xmath0 and @xmath2 . using an annulus geometry for the grb outflow ( i.e. a hollow jet ) , eichler & levinson ( 2004 ) obtain a relation between the apparent @xmath0 and @xmath2 consistent with or shallower than the relation .",
    "a potential problem with the off - aperture jet model is the expected distribution of grb peak photon fluxes . the average photon flux ( taken as a measure for the peak photon flux ) of bursts seen at an offset angle less than @xmath14 is larger than @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the burst duration .",
    "the number of such bursts is @xmath29 .",
    "thus , the cumulative peak - flux distribution expected in this model is @xmath30 ( for a volume - limited sample ) , which is flatter than that measured by batse ( e.g. pendleton et al 1996 ) , showing @xmath31 at peak fluxes between 1 and 10 photons/@xmath32 and @xmath33 at peak fluxes above 10 photons/@xmath32 .",
    "relativistic beaming of the emission from a jet wider than @xmath17 and seen from a location within its aperture may also be a possible origin of the relation , as both quantities of interest , @xmath0 and @xmath2 , are affected by the source relativistic motion . in this case ,",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 ( only one power of @xmath22 because relativistic angular beaming also reduces the source observed angular size by a factor @xmath21 relative to that of the entire source ) , hence @xmath37 is expected if comoving - frame burst properties were universal or uncorrelated .",
    "thus , the relation can not be explained with just relativistic effects and requires a correlation of the comoving - frame peak energy @xmath24 and grb output @xmath25 or a correlation of at least one of these quantities with the source lorentz factor @xmath16 ( schaefer 2003 ) .",
    "evidently , progress in this direction requires that a specific mechanism for the grb emission generation is adopted ( as done below ) .",
    "in that venue , zhang & mszros ( 2002 ) showed that the relation may be accommodated with internal shocks , by noting that the comoving - frame magnetic field of a poynting outflow ( or that generated through shock dissipation ) satisfies @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the outflow s poynting flux luminosity ( or that of the dissipated , internal energy ) and @xmath40 is the radius at which the burst emission is produced .",
    "the grb synchrotron emission peaks at @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the typical electron energy in the grb source .",
    "thus , one obtains the relations if ( 1 ) the outflow s poynting ( or internal energy ) luminosity is a good measure of the grb output ( in the sense that the @xmath43 ratio is universal ) and if ( 2 ) @xmath44 and @xmath40 are universal ( or not correlated with @xmath39 ) .",
    "note that the above argument applies to any dissipation mechanism . for internal shocks",
    ", the first condition above would lead to a constraint between the history of ejecta lorentz factors ( @xmath45 ) and the distribution of ejecta mass with the lorentz factor , while the second requirement for the grb radius would constrain only @xmath45 . as for the condition on the electron lorentz factor , we note that , if electrons acquire a fraction @xmath46 of the outflow s internal energy , i.e. @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the electron number ( @xmath49 being the outflow isotropic - equivalent kinetic energy ) and @xmath50 is the internal energy ( with @xmath51 being the volume of the grb source ) , then @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the outflow kinetic luminosity .",
    "the requirement that @xmath44 is not correlated with @xmath39 ( leading to the relation ) implies that either @xmath54 or that @xmath55 , otherwise one would obtain that @xmath56 .",
    "similarly , constraints on some model properties are required to explain the relation if the burst emission results from comptonization of the thermal radiation produced by magnetic reconnection or shock dissipation below the baryonic and/or pair photospheres . in this model ( mszros & rees 2000 , ryde 2004 , ramirez - ruiz 2005 ) , the grb peak energy and luminosity are correlated because both depend on the photospheric temperature .",
    "rees & mszros ( 2005 ) have shown that , if dissipation occurs above the saturation radius , then @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the grb luminosity .",
    "then the relation requires a certain correlation of the burst luminosity with the photosphere s lorentz factor . within the same model for the burst emission , thompson ( 2006 )",
    "has shown that the relation is obtained if the burst thermal radiation is produced at the stellar progenitor s photosphere , for which the rest - frame temperature of the photons is @xmath59 , and assuming that the outflow opening is set by its lateral expansion at the sound speed ( @xmath60 ) and that the collimation - corrected grb output ( @xmath61 ) is universal ( as was first indicated by the analysis of frail et al 2001 and later shown to be incorrect by that the grb collimated output ranges over 2 decades ",
    "e.g. figure 1 of ghirlanda , ghisellini & lazzati 2004 ) .    in this work",
    ", we present a possible origin of the relation related to the dynamics of the grb source , assuming an observer located within the opening of the relativistic outflow ( i.e. viewing geometry is not at work ) .",
    "if the burst emission is synchrotron , then the peak of the grb @xmath1 spectrum is at @xmath62 and the flux density at that photon energy is @xmath63 , where @xmath44 is the electron typical comoving - frame lorentz factor and @xmath64 the number of electrons in the grb source . the grb output being @xmath65 , it follows that the relation requires @xmath66 if the burst emission were inverse - compton scatterings of the synchrotron emission generated by same electrons , then @xmath0 picks an extra - factor @xmath67 and @xmath68 a factor @xmath69 , the optical thickness to electron scattering of the grb source",
    ". then the relation requires @xmath70    it is tempting to attribute the relation to @xmath71 variations from burst to burst of the @xmath72 factor , which appears both in the peak energy @xmath0 and the grb output @xmath2 , @xmath73 universality of @xmath44 , and @xmath74 the remaining `` dummy '' parameters ( @xmath64 , @xmath28 , @xmath69 ) being either universal or uncorrelated with @xmath72 ( so that they do not yield a different @xmath75 dependence ) .",
    "we note that variations in @xmath44 ( for synchrotron ) or @xmath67 ( for inverse - compton ) from burst to burst that are larger than those of @xmath72 would induce a @xmath37 correlation for either emission process .    the burst duration @xmath28 , which is the only observable that appears in equations ( [ sy ] ) and ( [ ic ] ) , has a spread of 1.5 - 2.0 orders of magnitude among long - bursts , which is comparable to the observed spread in grb energy @xmath2 at fixed peak energy @xmath0 ( see figure 1 of ghirlanda et al 2008 ) .",
    "this suggests that the observed spread in the relation requires some correlation among the dummy parameters , although it is possible that the range of measured @xmath2 is smaller than the true spread because , for a fixed peak energy , bursts of a lower grb output may fall below detection .",
    "if the grb emitting electrons are accelerated at shocks , then it is unlikely that the product @xmath72 can vary among bursts while @xmath44 is universal , because acceleration of electrons at relativistic shocks is expected to yield an electron lorentz factor @xmath44 that depends on that of the shock . as the latter bears a connection with the grb source lorentz factor @xmath16 , a universal @xmath44 requires either universal @xmath16 and @xmath46 or an ad - hoc correlation of these parameters . in the former case ,",
    "the relation would rest entirely on variations in the magnetic field @xmath76 among bursts .",
    "the nearly 3 decades spread in observed @xmath0 and that @xmath77 imply that the fraction @xmath78 of the internal energy stored in shock - generated magnetic fields has a range of 6 decades .",
    "thus , a universal @xmath44 requires a mechanism for electron acceleration at shocks that is completely decoupled from to the generation of magnetic fields , which is an extreme requirement .",
    "for example , in the weibel instability model of medvedev ( 2006 ) , proton current filaments created by the instability produce electric fields which accelerate electrons over distances of about the proton plasma skin - depth , leading to @xmath79 , hence the 3 decades range of observed peak energies @xmath0 would be associated with an electron @xmath44 which is far from being universal .",
    "thus , it seems much more likely that relation is not due just to variations in the @xmath72 term among bursts and that some or all of the other parameters appearing in equations ( [ sy ] ) and ( [ ic ] ) contribute as well . to include their effect in driving the relation",
    ", we assume that the outflow s energy is dissipated by shocks which accelerates electrons and generate magnetic fields that acquire quasi - universal fractions of the dissipated energy .",
    "some justification for the latter assumption is that , if the electron and magnetic parameters @xmath46 and @xmath78 were correlated as for the weibel instability model , then their variations among bursts would induce a @xmath80 correlation for synchrotron emission and @xmath81 correlation for inverse - compton .    in the following section , we study the implications of equations ( [ sy ] ) and ( [ ic ] ) , representing the relation , in the framework of _ external shocks_. we note that this model has the drawback that the efficiency of the grb emission should be small ( below 10 percent ) for those bursts with a large number ( hundreds ) of pulses ( sari & piran 1997 ) .",
    "the same can be done for internal shocks which , as discussed above , will lead to constraints on the distribution of the ejecta lorentz factor with mass and ejection time ( or variability timescale ) .",
    "a low grb efficiency is also expected for this model ( e.g. kumar 1999 ) .",
    "the external shock driven by the interaction of the relativistic ejecta with the burst ambient medium offers two possible grb sources : the reverse shock , which energizes the ejecta , and the forward shock , which sweeps - up the circumburst medium . denoting by @xmath82 the lorentz factor of either shock as measured in the frame of the incoming gas ( the ejecta or the ambient medium ) , the shock jump conditions lead to an internal energy density in the shocked gas that is @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the comoving - frame particle density in the shocked fluid and @xmath85 that in the unshocked gas .",
    "thus , for a relativistic shock @xmath86 ) , the typical electron lorentz factor is @xmath87 and the magnetic field is @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the ambient medium density and @xmath16 the laboratory - frame lorentz factor of the shocked gas ( i.e. the grb source ) , the latter being valid also for the reverse shock because the contact discontinuity between the two shocked media is in hydrostatic equilibrium , ( i.e. pressure and internal energy density is the same behind both shocks ) .    for a source moving at lorentz factor @xmath16 ,",
    "the burst duration is @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the grb source radius , which results from either the spread in the photon arrival time across the visible area of angular opening @xmath17 or from the observer duration of the source travel - time up to radius @xmath40 ( provided that the source is decelerating or accelerating slower than @xmath92 ) . adding that the optical thickness to electron scattering is @xmath93 , the relation of equations ( [ sy ] ) and ( [ ic ] ) becomes @xmath94 for synchrotron emission and @xmath95 for inverse - compton .",
    "below , we investigate the conditions required for the synchrotron and inverse - compton emissions from the reverse and forward shocks to accommodate the relation with the following simplifications : + ( 1 ) the burst emission is produced before the reverse shock crosses the ejecta shell , i.e. before the deceleration of the external shock starts .",
    "one reason for this restriction is that the shock - crossing radius offers a `` milestone '' in the evolution of the external shock that could be the grb radius @xmath91 , while no such reference point exist after deceleration sets in .",
    "a second reason is that it would be unnatural for a decelerating external shock to radiate episodically , once during the burst , until 100 s , and then again staring after 1000 s , during the afterglow , as observed in the x - ray emission of a majority of swift grbs ( obrien et al 2006 , willingale et al 2007 ) , + ( 2 ) the entire emitting fluid moves at the same lorentz factor @xmath96 and is filled with the same magnetic field @xmath97 , with the values taken at the radius were the burst emission is released . as @xmath0 , @xmath98 , and @xmath16",
    "are power - laws in the shock radius , for a radially extended burst emission , their burst - averaged ( @xmath99 ) and burst - integrated ( @xmath100 with @xmath101 ) values have the same dependence on @xmath91 as their values at @xmath91 , + ( 3 ) the distribution with energy of the shock - accelerated electrons is softer than @xmath102 above the typical @xmath44 , so that the peak of @xmath1 is for the typical @xmath44 electrons and not at a higher random lorentz factor determined by electron cooling and/or acceleration , + ( 4 ) the electrons with the typical lorentz factor @xmath44 do not cool significantly during the grb emission .",
    "we note that only a small of the batse bursts ( preece et al 2000 ) have the @xmath103 spectrum below the peak energy @xmath0 expected in the opposite case .",
    "if the @xmath44-electrons cool during the burst , the @xmath1 spectrum still peaks at the synchrotron or inverse - compton energy corresponding to @xmath44 ( i.e. the peak energy @xmath0 remains unchanged ) , but the flux at @xmath0 picks a multiplying factor @xmath104 for synchrotron and a factor @xmath105 for inverse - compton , owing to that most electrons are at the cooling lorentz factor @xmath106 for which the radiative cooling timescale is equal to the burst duration .",
    "thus , the treatment provided below is not sufficiently comprehensive and serves only as an illustration of the conditions required for the external shock to account for the relation .      for the evolution of the ejecta ",
    "ambient medium interaction at times before the reverse shock crosses the ejecta shell ( i.e. before the standard deceleration sets - in ) , the shock jump conditions can be used to derive a fourth - degree equation for the lorentz factor @xmath16 of the shocked fluid ( which is the same for both the shocked ejecta and the swept - up ambient medium ) . as shown by panaitescu & kumar ( 2004 ) ,",
    "the solution of that equation is @xmath107^{-1/2 } \\ ; \\label{g}\\ ] ] where @xmath108 is the lorentz factor of the unshocked ejecta and @xmath109 their comoving - frame density .    in the @xmath110 limit ( thin and dense ejecta shell ) ,",
    "equation ( [ g ] ) leads to @xmath111 , independent of the @xmath112 ratio , and to a mildly relativistic reverse shock of constant lorentz factor @xmath82 . if @xmath16 and @xmath82 do not change with radius , then equations ( [ syn ] ) and ( [ inv ] ) imply that the relation is induced by a certain correlation of the ejecta lorentz factor @xmath108 with the radius @xmath91 where the grb emission is released .",
    "we focus on the forward shock emission because the mildly relativistic reverse shock is unlikely to yield an emission spectrum peaking in the hard x - rays .",
    "for the forward shock , @xmath113 and @xmath114 for an ambient medium density stratified as @xmath115 with @xmath116 , and @xmath117 if @xmath118 .    for synchrotron emission and",
    "@xmath119 , equation ( [ syn ] ) requires @xmath120 .",
    "if @xmath108 were universal , this leads to an inconsistent solution @xmath121 .",
    "thus @xmath108 should vary among bursts , in which case the requirement imposed by the relation is that the _ grb emission is released at a radius that is correlated with the ejecta lorentz factor_. further investigation can be done if @xmath91 is determined in some way .",
    "the termination shock of the wind expelled by the grb progenitor is the only milestone expected in the evolution of the forward shock , though it is not evident how it could set the grb radius ; even that were achieved , the location of the termination shock should not be related to the ejecta initial lorentz factor .",
    "instead , we speculate that the location where the forward - shock grb emission is released is tied to the radius @xmath122 at which the reverse shock crosses the ejecta ( @xmath49 being the ejecta kinetic energy ) , and after which the blast - wave is decelerated . then and the relation can be obtained if @xmath123 , which is inconsistent with the starting assumption @xmath116 .    for synchrotron emission and",

    "relating @xmath91 to the shock - crossing radius @xmath126 , a self - consistent solution ( @xmath127 ) is found , for which @xmath128 .    for inverse - compton emission and",
    "@xmath119 , equation ( [ inv ] ) requires @xmath129 .",

    "the relation requires @xmath136 , which for @xmath131 leads to @xmath130 , i.e. an inconsistent solution .",
    "therefore , for a thin ejecta shell , the relation can be explained with synchrotron emission from the forward shock if grbs are produced at the radius where the reverse shock crosses the ejecta shell and if the ambient medium around bursts has a universal @xmath137 radial structure , bursts with higher peak energy @xmath0 and grb output @xmath138 resulting for lower ejecta lorentz factors @xmath108 or larger ejecta kinetic energies @xmath49 .",
    "the relation can also be obtained with inverse - compton emission if @xmath139 and @xmath108 are universal , bursts with higher @xmath0 and @xmath138 resulting from a lower @xmath49 , or if @xmath140 for all bursts if @xmath108 is not universal , a higher @xmath0 and @xmath138 being obtained for a higher @xmath108 or lower @xmath49 .      in the @xmath141 limit ( thick and tenuous ejecta shell ) ,",
    "equation ( [ g ] ) leads to @xmath142 and to a relativistic reverse shock with @xmath143 .",
    "considering that the radial width of the ejecta shell increases linearly with its radius , the comoving - frame ejecta density is @xmath144 .",
    "then , for a ambient medium with radial density profile @xmath145 , we obtain that the lorentz factor of the shocked gas evolves as @xmath146 . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath118 , the shocked gas motion is accelerated by the ram pressure of the incoming ejecta , starting from a value well below @xmath108 ( and remaining below it at all times ) . for @xmath116 ,",
    "the grb source is decelerating ( but this deceleration is substantially slower than that after the reverse shock has crossed the ejecta shell ) .    in the following investigation",
    ", we drop the dependence of two quantities of interest , @xmath0 and @xmath138 , on the ejecta lorentz factor @xmath108 , i.e. we assume it to be universal , and determine the stratification index @xmath147 that accommodates the relation .",

    "if @xmath108 were not universal , the relation could be explained if the grb radius @xmath91 and @xmath108 satisfy a certain relation .",

    ", assuming that the @xmath1 spectrum peaks at @xmath220 , the relation requires @xmath192 , which is incompatible with the working condition @xmath118 . for @xmath118 , assuming that the @xmath1 spectrum peaks at @xmath221 , the relation leads to @xmath222 , implying @xmath223 and @xmath224 , from where @xmath211 and @xmath192 , again incompatible with the starting condition .",
    "thus , synchrotron emission from the reverse shock can account for the relation provided that bursts occur at various radii in a @xmath196 medium , while inverse - compton emission can explain the same relation if @xmath225 .",
    "for either radiation process , bursts of higher @xmath0 and @xmath2 are those occurring at smaller radii .",
    "we have investigated the ability of the external shock ( produced by the interaction of relativistic ejecta with the ambient medium ) to accommodate the relation between the burst peak energy and isotropic - equivalent energy release .",
    "first , we noted that it seems unlikely that the relation is due to variations of the quantity @xmath72 among bursts , with the electron lorentz factor @xmath44 being universal and all other quantities ( @xmath64 , @xmath28 , @xmath69 ) in the right - hand sides of equations ( [ sy ] ) and ( [ ic ] ) not being correlated with @xmath0 .",
    "that is so because electron acceleration at relativistic shocks is likely related to the generation of magnetic fields and with the strength of the shock and because the number of radiating electrons @xmath64 and the burst duration @xmath28 could be related with the dynamics of the external shock .",
    "for that reason , we have identified the conditions that lead to the relation by taking into account all the quantities that determine @xmath0 and @xmath2 . after making some simplifications ( uniform magnetic field , single lorentz factor in the shocked fluid , negligible electron cooling ) , and considering only the external shock emission before the reverse shock crosses the ejecta shell ( as an interrupted burst  afterglow emission from the same decelerating outflow seems too contrived ) ,",
    "we have determined the dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath2 on the radius where ( or up to which ) the burst emission is produced , with allowance for both the reverse and forward shock , synchrotron and inverse - compton emissions , and relativistic or semi - relativistic reverse shock . in the latter case , only the forward shock is expected to produce the high - energy prompt emission , the relation requiring a correlation between the ejecta lorentz factor and the grb radius which does not have a plausible justification .",
    "for that reason , we favour an explanation of the relation where the reverse shock is relativistic .    in our treatment of that case",
    ", the burst emission is assumed to arise over a small range of source radii or up to a certain radius , the relation resulting from variations in that radius from burst to burst .",
    "the reverse shock crossing the ejecta or the external shock encountering the termination shock of the progenitor s freely expanding wind are the milestones in the dynamical evolution of the reverse and forward shock , respectively , that could set the location where the burst radius is produced .",
    "this implies that the variations from burst to burst in the radius at which the prompt emission is released is due to either ( 1 ) variations among bursts in the kinetic energy of the ejecta or in the duration of ejecta release ( for a reverse shock origin of the grb ) , or ( 2 ) to the history of the mass - loss of the grb progenitor shortly before its core collapse ( for grbs produced by the forward shock ) .    within the external - shock model for grbs",
    ", the relation can be accounted for by just the power - law radial stratification of the burst ambient medium density .",
    "for the four possible combinations of dissipation shock and radiation process , we find the following density profiles : @xmath225 ( inverse - compton from reverse shock ) , @xmath226 ( inverse - compton from forward shock ) , and @xmath227 ( synchrotron from either shock ) . in general , a steep ambient profile is required to explain the slope of the relation because of the weak dependence of the source lorentz factor on the density of the ambient medium ( @xmath228  equation [ g ] )",
    ".    none of the ambient medium stratification required by the relation is the @xmath229 profile expected for a massive stellar grb progenitor expelling a constant speed wind a steady mass - loss rate . considering that the burst emission occurs at @xmath230 cm and that the wind termination shock moves at @xmath231 ) , this implies that , in the last @xmath232 years before core collapse , the wolf - rayet progenitor of long - bursts had a varying mass - loss rate or wind terminal velocity",
    "however , we do rule out that , by relaxing the simplifying assumptions made here , the ambient medium density profile required to explain the relation with the external - shock emission becomes consistent with @xmath229 .",
    "as the burst model employed here is that of the external shock before the reverse shock crosses the ejecta ( i.e. before deceleration begins ) , the ensuing afterglow emission could be attributed to the emission from the reverse or forward shocks after deceleration , with allowance for injection of ejecta and energy after the burst , to account for the extended afterglow emission ( if it is from the reverse shock ) and the x - ray light - curve plateaus ( if it is from the forward shock ) .",
    "then , the general lack of continuity of burst - to - afterglow emissions , shown by the steep fall - off of the x - ray flux by 23 dex at the end of the burst , would lead to a rather contrived model , where the discontinuous burst - to - afterglow emission requires a temporary switch - off of the external - shock emission , followed by a much softer emission ( the afterglows ) .",
    "a simpler is that where the two emission phases , prompt and delayed , are attributed to different outflows , with the burst arising from a narrower jet whose bright , high - energy emission is produced only before the reverse shock crosses the ejecta or the external shock reaches the wind termination shock , but having a sufficiently low , collimated kinetic energy , so that its post - burst ( forward shock ) emission is dimmer than that from a wider , more energetic outflow producing the afterglow emission .",
