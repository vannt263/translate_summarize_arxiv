    "there have been numerous electron spectroscopic investigations of the metastable hexagonal phase of nickel monosulphide ( nis ) , primarily to understand its unusual electronic phase transition @xcite .",

    "there have been very few studies to understand the electronic structure of this compound .",
    "band structure calculation performed for the millerite phase of nis @xcite showed the ground state to be metallic , in agreement with experimental results",
    ". however , no comparison between experimental and theoretical results exists and the details of the electronic structure in terms of the electronic structure parameters are still unknown .    in the present study , we investigate the electronic structure of millerite phase of nis using x - ray photoemission  ( xp ) and ultra - violet photoemission  ( up ) measurements in conjunction with _",

    ", we study the evolution of the spectral function with changing correlation effects in the metallic regime .",
    "for the preparation of the millerite samples , polycrystalline samples of hexagonal nis was prepared first by solid state reaction  @xcite .",
    "hexagonal nis sample was then sealed in quartz tube in high vacuum and was maintained at 573  k for about 2 - 3 weeks and was cooled slowly to room temperature over a period of 8  hours , to obtain the millerite phase .",
    "the @xmath12-ray powder diffraction measurements confirmed the phase purity of the sample .",
    "spectroscopic measurements were carried out in a combined vsw spectrometer with a base pressure of 2@xmath13 mbar equipped with a monochromatized al  k@xmath14 @xmath12-ray source and a helium discharge lamp .",
    "xp spectroscopic measurements were performed on the samples with an overall instrumental resolution of better than 0.8  ev , while up measurements for he  i and he  ii are performed with an instrumental resolution better than 90 mev and 120 mev , respectively .",
    "the sample surface was cleaned _ in situ _ periodically during the experiment by scraping with an alumina file and the surface cleanliness was monitored by recording the carbon 1@xmath15 and oxygen 1@xmath15 xp signal regions .",
    "the binding energy was calibrated to the instrumental fermi - level which was determined by recording the fermi - edge region from a clean silver sample .",
    "scalar relativistic linearized muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) band structure calculations have been performed within the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) for millerite phase of nis with the real crystal structure @xcite . here , the rhombohedral unit cell consisting of 3 formula units was employed .",
    "sphere radii used for ni and s were 2.49 and 2.55 a.u .",
    ", respectively .",
    "17 empty spheres with sphere radii in the range of 0.9 to 1.65 a.u . were also used .",
    "convergence was obtained with @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 orbitals at ni and s atomic spheres and @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the empty spheres , with 220  @xmath18 points in the irreducible part of the brillouin zone .",
    "core level and valence band  ( vb ) spectra were calculated for millerite nis , using a nis@xmath19 cluster as found in the solid ( see fig .",
    "[ mil - stru@3](b ) ) , within a parameterized many - body model including orbital dependent electron - electron ( multiplet ) interactions .",
    "the calculational method has been described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the calculations were performed including all the transition metal 3@xmath17 and sulphur 3@xmath16 orbitals . in the vb calculation ,",
    "ni  3@xmath17 and s  3@xmath16 contributions to the valence band spectra were calculated within the _ same _ model and with the _ same _ parameter values .",
    "as the dimension of the hamiltonian matrix is large , lanczos method was used to evaluate the spectral function and the calculated one - electron removal spectra were appropriately broadened to simulate the experimental spectra . in the ni  2@xmath16 core level calculation , doniach-@xmath20unji@xmath21 line shape function @xcite was used for broadening the discrete energy spectrum of the cluster model , in order to represent the asymmetric line shape of core levels from these highly metallic compounds ; similar asymmetric line shapes are also found in the other core levels in this system . in the case of vb calculations ,",
    "energy dependent lorentzian function was used for the lifetime broadening .",
    "other broadening effects such as the resolution broadening and solid state effects were taken into account by convoluting the spectra with a gaussian function .",
    "the broadening parameters were found to be consistent with values used for similar systems @xcite . since the atomic cross - sections for the ni  3@xmath17 and s  3@xmath16 states are vastly different",
    ", it is necessary to calculate a weighted average of these two contributions to the valence band .",
    "the atomic cross - section ratio @xcite between s @xmath22 and ni @xmath23 states ( @xmath24 0.17 ) is not appropriate in this context , since solid - state effects alter this ratio significantly @xcite .",
    "it was found that s 3@xmath16/ni 3@xmath17 cross - section ratio of approximately 5.5 times that obtained from the atomic calculations gives the best result for the valence band calculations .",
    "the total as well as partial ni  @xmath17 and s  @xmath16 densities of states ( dos ) obtained from the lmto band structure calculation are shown in fig .",
    "[ mil - dos@3 ] .",
    "the thick solid line represents the total dos , while thin solid line and dashed line show the ni  3@xmath17 and s  3@xmath16 partial dos , respectively .",
    "our results are in good agreement with that of a previously published calculation @xcite .",
    "the overall features of the dos for millerite phase is similar to that obtained for the paramagnetic hexagonal phase of nis @xcite .",
    "however , in this case , the fermi - level lies in the rising part of the dos , instead of close to a minimum in dos as in the case of hexagonal nis where an instability in the fermi - surface can open up a gap in certain directions of the fermi - surface @xcite .",
    "this distinction may partially be responsible for the absence of any phase transition in the millerite phase .",
    "the dos between -3.5  ev and 1.2  ev is dominated by the ni  3@xmath17 contributions . near the fermi energy region , there is a substantial contribution from the s  3@xmath16 states , due to the strong covalency ( ni  @xmath17-s  @xmath16 interactions ) in the system , forming the antibonding states .",
    "the dos in the energy range -5.5  ev to -3.5  ev has dominant ni  3@xmath17 and s  3@xmath16 contributions and represents the bonding states of the system . in the energy range , -8  ev to -5.5  ev , s  3@xmath16 contribution is dominant with a smaller contribution from the ni  3@xmath17 states ;",
    "these non - bonding states of the s  3@xmath16 are stabilized in energy compared to ni  @xmath17-s  @xmath16 bonding states due to strong s - s interactions , similar to the case of hexagonal nis and other sulphides @xcite .",
    "the peak at @xmath25  ev resulting from the ni  3@xmath17 ( @xmath26-like states ) is shifted to a higher energy compared to the @xmath26 states of the hexagonal nis .",
    "this is related to the formation of the direct ni - ni bonds in the millerite phase leading to the stabilization of this phase compared to the hexagonal phase @xcite .",
    "the band structure results are compared with the experimental data in fig .",
    "[ mil - dos - fit@3 ] .",
    "the partial densities of states of ni  3@xmath17 and s  3@xmath16 are broadened with the experimental xp spectroscopic resolution of 0.8  ev and are shown along with valence band spectra taken with 21.2  ev ( ) , 40.8  ev ( ) and 1486.6  ev ( al  k@xmath14 ) photon energies .",
    "such a comparison provides an experimental determination of the orbital characters of the various features in the experimental spectra , since the photoemission cross sections for ni 3@xmath17 and s 3@xmath16 vary significantly with the photon energy .",
    "the decrease in the intensity of features b and c in going from 21.2  ev photon energy to 40.8  ev is explained by the cooper minimum in the s  3@xmath16 photoionization cross section at around 50  ev , indicating the dominance of the s  3@xmath16 contributions in these two spectral features , with feature a dominated by the ni  3@xmath17 contribution . from band structure results , the feature b has contributions from s  3@xmath16 as well as from ni  3@xmath17 , while the feature c is dominated by s  3@xmath16 states .",
    "although the band structure calculations reproduce the features b and c rather well , the energy position of the feature a is not correctly reproduced , with the calculated peak appearing at about 0.4  ev higher binding energy compared to the experiment .",
    "this discrepancy between the experimental results and band structure calculations is attributed to the electron correlation effects within the ni 3@xmath17 levels ; thus , it appears that correlation effects continue to have important influence even for this highly metallic system .",
    "this has prompted us to go beyond the band structure theories and study the electronic structure of this system using a cluster - model , where the electron correlation effects are explicitly taken into account .",
    "the ni  2@xmath16 core level spectrum for the millerite phase of nis is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ mil - ni2p - fit@3 ] by solid circles .",
    "the spectrum consists of spin - orbit split 2@xmath27 ( 852.8  ev binding energy ) and 2@xmath28 ( 870.2  ev binding energy ) signals with strong satellite features at about 859.5  ev and 876  ev binding energies , corresponding to 2@xmath27 and 2@xmath28 signals , respectively .",
    "the intense satellite features in the ni  2@xmath16 core level spectrum point to the presence of the electron correlations in the system .",
    "the 2@xmath27 and 2@xmath28 peaks show strong asymmetries , similar to hexagonal form of nis @xcite . in order to determine the inelastic scattering background ,",
    "we have performed electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) on these samples , with the same primary energy as that of the ni  @xmath29 core level peak . using a procedure that have been previously employed @xcite , the inelastic background function obtained for millerite nis",
    "is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ mil - ni2p - fit@3 ] as a solid line .",
    "the background function is a highly structured function with a broad plasmon loss feature around 876  ev , giving rise to an apparently stronger satellite intensity for the ni  2@xmath28 peak compared to the satellite intensity accompanying the 2@xmath27 signal .",
    "we have performed core and valence band calculations within a single model for a nis@xmath19 cluster .",
    "the cluster fragment used for the calculation is shown in fig .",
    "[ mil - stru@3](b ) . within this model",
    ", we consider only one ni atom ; effects due to the strong ni - ni interactions present in this compound could not be considered due to the prohibitively large basis set involved in such calculations . for ni@xmath30 ,",
    "the electron - electron interaction parameters , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 used were same as that for hexagonal form of nis @xcite . in the main panel of fig .",
    "[ mil - ni2p - fit@3 ] , we show the calculated core level spectrum ( solid line ) including the experimentally determined inelastic scattering background , superimposed on the experimental spectrum ( open circles ) for the parameter set s - ni @xmath36 = -1.8  ev , @xmath37 = 1.0  ev and @xmath38 = 4.0  ev . the calculated spectrum without any broadening effect is presented as a stick diagram at the bottom of the same figure .",
    "the calculated spectrum matches reasonably well with the experimental spectrum . however , there are some differences between the calculated spectrum and the experimental one ; the rising edge of the ni  2@xmath27 at @xmath39  ev and the satellite energy region of the 2@xmath28 peak are not accurately described by the calculation .",
    "such discrepancies between the experimental and calculated spectrum may have its origin in the neglect of the strong metal - metal bonds in the system or due to the slight differences in the background function generated from the eels spectrum and the actual background in the photoemission spectrum .",
    "the @xmath36 values obtained for millerite nis ( -1.8  ev ) is considerably larger than that obtained for other ni - s systems like , hexagonal nis @xcite ( @xmath40  ev ) , nis@xmath7 @xcite ( @xmath41  ev ) and banis@xmath7 @xcite ( @xmath41  ev ) .",
    "this significant increase in the @xmath36 for the millerite case is related to the shorter ni - s bonds in the system compared to the other nickel sulphides , as mentioned earlier , leading to a high degree of covalency .",
    "the value of the charge transfer energy ( @xmath42  ev ) obtained for the millerite nis is smaller than the hexagonal form of nis @xcite ( 2.5  ev ) and nis@xmath7 @xcite ( 2.0  ev ) .",
    "however , a similar value of @xmath37 has been observed in another ni - s system , banis@xmath7 @xcite ( @xmath43  ev ) ; significantly , banis@xmath7 has the same local geometry around ni atoms as that in the millerite nis with nis@xmath19 cluster in a pyramidal arrangement .",
    "it has been observed in the case of divalent nickel oxides @xcite that as the dimensionality of the ni - o connectivity decreases , the charge transfer energy decreases , a change in the madelung potential .",
    "thus , the decrease in the @xmath37 for millerite phase compared to hexagonal nis is also possibly due to a change in the madelung potential arising from the decreased local coordination of ni atoms . the lower value of @xmath37 for the millerite phase compared to the hexagonal phase leads to a higher degree hybridization mixing of ni  @xmath17 and s  @xmath16 states in the system , leading to an enhanced covalency .",
    "it turns out that the on - site coulomb interaction strength , @xmath44 , is very similar between millerite , hexagonal nis @xcite and nis@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this shows that @xmath44 is not very sensitive to the local co - ordination or to the metallic / insulating property within the series of nickel sulphides .",
    "according to the zsa @xcite phase diagram , these parameters ( small @xmath37 and large hopping strength ) place the millerite phase deep inside the @xmath0-metallic regime .",
    "our calculations suggest that the ground state wavefunction of the millerite phase consists of 52% , 42.6% and 5.4% of @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 configurations with a high - spin @xmath48 state .",
    "the average @xmath17-occupancy ( @xmath49 ) of the system is found to be 8.53 , which is substantially larger than that obtained for hexagonal nis ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "this establishes a strongly covalent ground state of the millerite phase , compared to other sulphides studied . in order to understand the origin of various features in the experimental core level spectrum ,",
    "we have analyzed the characters of some typical final states , marked 1 - 10 in the main panel of fig .",
    "[ mil - ni2p - fit@3 ] , in terms of contributions from various configurations ( @xmath45 , @xmath51 and @xmath47 ) ( see table  [ mil - ni2p - tab@3 ] ) .",

    "[ mil - ni2p - fit@3 ] ) , the weak satellite region between 856  ev and 858  ev ( labelled 4 and 5 ) , intense satellite region between 858  ev and 861  ev ( labelled 6 - 8 ) and the high energy satellites beyond 863  ev ( labelled 9 and 10 ) .",
    "the first , third and fourth group of features have essentially similar characteristics as those in the hexagonal phase , with dominant @xmath51 , significant contributions from all configurations , and dominant @xmath45 configuration , respectively @xcite .",
    "however , the second group of features , which is absent in the hexagonal phase of nis , have almost 90% of the contributions coming from the well - screened @xmath51 configuration . almost pure charge transfer nature of these states is possibly due to the shorter ni - s distances and a lower value of @xmath37 .    within the same model",
    ", we have calculated the xp valence band spectrum of the millerite phase . the calculated spectrum ( solid line ) along with ni  3@xmath17 ( dashed line ) and s  3@xmath16 ( dot - dashed line ) contributions for the millerite phase are shown superimposed on the experimental xp valence band spectrum ( open circles ) in fig .",
    "[ mil - vb - fit@3 ] .",
    "the inelastic scattering background is taken to have an integral energy dependence and is shown as a dotted line .",
    "the ni  3@xmath17 contributions to the vb spectrum without any broadening effects are shown as a stick diagram .",
    "the parameter set used for the vb calculation is very similar to that used for the core level calculation ; however , it was found that a @xmath36 of -1.6  ev instead of -1.8  ev provides a better agreement with the experimental result .",
    "the agreement between the experimental and calculated spectra is reasonably good over the entire energy range .",
    "the features a and b are reproduced rather well , however , the feature c as well as the region close to the fermi energy ( lower binding energy side of the feature a ) could not be described very accurately .",
    "this is however , not very surprising .",
    "the feature c is dominated by states arising from s @xmath16-s @xmath16 interactions , as shown by the band structure results ( see fig .",
    "[ mil - dos - fit@3 ] ) . since we do not take this interaction in to account , and also due to the intrinsic limitation of a cluster model to account for such band structure effects , the feature c is completely absent in the results of the cluster model .",
    "it is reasonable to expect the features close to the @xmath52 to be influenced by substantial ni - ni nearest - neighbor interactions present in this compound , explaining the discrepancy between the experiment and the results based on the cluster model neglecting such metal - metal interactions .",
    "the analysis of the ground state wave function shows that the ground state has 55.2% , 40.4% and 4.4% of @xmath45 , @xmath51 and @xmath47 configurations , respectively yielding an average occupancy of 8.49 , with a high - spin configuration .",
    "the analysis of the final state configurations for a selected set ( marked 1 - 10 in fig .",
    "[ mil - vb - fit@3 ] ) of final states have been carried out and the results are given in table  [ mil - vb - tab@3 ] .",
    "the various features can be grouped into different categories , namely the main peak region at 1 - 3  ev binding energy ( labelled 1 - 3 , corresponding to feature a ) , region b in the range of 4 - 7  ev ( labelled 4 - 7 ) and weaker satellites beyond 7  ev ( labelled 8 - 10 and corresponding to feature d ) .",
    "the first group of features has the dominant contribution coming from the well screened @xmath53 states with a non - negligible contribution from the poorly screened @xmath54 states and overscreened @xmath55 states .",
    "these contributions are found to be similar to those observed in the case of hexagonal nis @xcite .",
    "the second group of features are predominantly contributed by @xmath53 and @xmath55 states , while in the case of hexagonal phase it was dominated by @xmath54 states .",
    "the third group of features have a high degree of @xmath54 character along with contributions from @xmath55 character , suggesting correlation effects within the ni @xmath17 states .",
    "these high energy , weak intensity satellites manifest in the valence band spectrum as a weak tailing of the spectrum beyond about 7  ev ( feature d in fig .",
    "[ mil - vb - fit@3 ] ) .",
    "it is to be noted here that the characters of these weak intensity features are nearly same as that of the features appearing between 6 and 8  ev binding energy in the vb spectrum of hexagonal nis which have been attributed to the spectral signature of the lower hubbard band , persisting in the @xmath0-metallic regime .",
    "hence , the lower hubbard band features are shifted to higher binding energies as well as becoming weaker in intensity in going from hexagonal nis to millerite nis , primarily due to an enhanced hopping strength in the millerite phase driving the system deeper in to the metallic regime .    although the presence of the hubbard bands in the metallic regime has been predicted by the dynamical mean - field theoretical ( dmft ) calculations , the evolution of these spectral features well inside the metallic regime has not been studied in detail as a function of various electronic interaction strengths . a recent dmft calculation for the spectral functions of a charge - transfer insulator near",
    "the metal - insulator transition boundary @xcite suggests that within the metallic regime , the spectral signatures of the hubbard band moves towards the fermi - level , collapsing with the coherent states , forming the metallic ground state of the system with decreasing @xmath37 .",
    "on the other hand , our experimental results establish that well inside the @xmath0-metallic regime , the hubbard band is further stabilized , moving towards higher binding energy region with increasing metallicity driven by enhanced hopping interaction strength between ni  @xmath17 and s  @xmath16 states .",
    "further experimental and theoretical efforts are needed in this direction to have a better understanding of the evolution of the electronic structure of these systems .    in conclusion ,",
    "the millerite phase of nis has been studied by means of electron spectroscopic techniques , band structure and model hamiltonian calculations .",
    "the band structure calculations were found to be more successful in describing the experimental valence band spectrum in comparison to the case of hexagonal nis , suggesting a reduced effect of electron correlation in the millerite phase .",
    "this is consistent with the highly conducting ground state of the millerite phase , in contrast to the antiferromagnetic and poorly conducting ground state of hexagonal nis .",
    "however , calculations including the electron correlation effects are found to be necessary for the description of certain features in the experimental spectra , indicating importance of such interaction effects even for such a highly metallic system .",
    "thus , it appears that both band structure effects and correlation effects need to be treated on an equal footing for a complete description of such systems .",
    "the various electronic parameter strengths obtained from these calculations indicate that the millerite phase of nis is a highly covalent metal ( @xmath0-metal ) . from the comparative study between hexagonal and millerite phases of nis",
