    "in both the weak value ( wv ) and null value ( nv ) measurement protocols there are two consecutive measurements . generally , using binary detectors ( `` click '' or `` no click '' )",
    ", we would have four possible outcomes at any given attempt : ( `` click '' , `` click '' ) , ( `` click '' , `` no click '' ) , ( `` no click '' , `` click '' ) , ( `` no click '' , `` no click '' ) , where the notation here is ( first measurement outcome , second measurement outcome ) . taking",
    "the outcome of a first weak measurement conditional to a strong second measurement ( i.e. , how the outcome of the first measurement is correlated with the given outcome of the second measurement ) would be proportional to the ( real or imaginary part of the ) standard weak value ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a partial - collapse measurement , employed in the nv protocol , is a measurement for which a `` click '' destroys the system .",
    "hence , in our scheme ( `` click '' , `` click '' ) is not allowed , and there are only three possible outcomes : ( `` click '' , `` no click '' ) , ( `` no click '' , `` click '' ) , ( `` no click '' , `` no click '' ) .",
    "note that having `` no click '' in the partial - collapse measurement still inflicts back action on the measured system .",
    "for the reasoning above the standard correlation between a `` click '' in the first measurement conditional to a `` click '' in the second measurement is trivially zero .",
    "by contrast , the correlation between a `` click '' in the first measurement conditional to `` no click '' in the second measurement is not trivial , which is the motivation for our _ null _ value scheme .",
    "the experimental setup consists of an exact mapping of this idea .",
    "the crucial point here , though , is to note what would be considered to be `` click '' and `` no click '' in either the first measurement or the second one . to be specific , impinging upon the window ( @xmath81 ) ( cf .",
    "fig.2 ) , a photon can either be deflected to a photon counter @xmath82 ( `` click '' ) , or pass through the window ( `` no click '' ) . a photon that has passed through the window reaches the second polarizer @xmath83 , where the second measurement takes place .",
    "it can either be absorbed by @xmath83 ( `` click '' in the second measurement ) or pass through it to the photon counter @xmath84 .",
    "thus , counting a photon in @xmath84 will correspond to `` no click '' in the second measurement .",
    "we provide here a description of the procedure leading to null values in terms of povms  @xcite .",
    "the procedure consists of two steps .",
    "first , the state is measured using a partial - collapse measurement @xmath85 where @xmath86 are the probabilities for the states @xmath87 to `` click '' , respectively .",
    "note that in the main text we have taken @xmath88 . following the partial - collapse step ,",
    "the state is measured with a projective measurement @xmath89 .",
    "consequently , we can represent the sequence of measurements with the following povm elements , @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "indeed this set forms a povm set @xmath93 .",
    "notably , unambiguous and intermediate state discriminations are performed by tuning such a three - component povm set  @xcite .",
    "there are several similar optical implementations of such three - component povm ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the measurement probabilities in the manuscript can be expressed in terms of these povm operators , @xmath94 where we wrote here the joint probabilities @xmath95 and @xmath95 .",
    "additionally , in table  [ table1 ] we provide a translation of the povm operators to `` clicks '' at different components in the experimental setup .",
    ".translation of the povm language to `` clicks '' in the experimental setup .",
    "a `` click '' is denoted by @xmath96 and `` no click '' by @xmath97 .",
    "note that while a `` click '' in the photon counters @xmath64 and @xmath65 is easily understood , a `` click '' in @xmath83 corresponds to a photon being absorbed by the polarizer .",
    "hence , a `` no click '' at the postselection stage corresponds to a photon not being absorbed in @xmath83 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the nv is composed of a correlation between the different povm components but can not be written directly as a povm .",

    "the experimental setup is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "a helium - neon laser at 633 nm is spatially filtered with a single mode fiber and attenuated to the picowatt level .",
    "the resulting photons are passed through a fixed polarizer and then through a movable half - wave plate and polarizer ; this ensures a pure polarization state ( @xmath6 ) and relatively constant flux as the angle of the polarization state is varied .",
    "the power at this stage is estimated by counting photons with a single photon detector when the removable mirror is in place .",
    "we note that the coupling efficiency for each single photon detector is measured ; for the snr theory calculations in the text , we include this efficiency , losses from colored glass filters to block background , as well as the quantum efficiency of the detectors .",
    "the removable mirror is then removed and the photons are sent to a glass window ( w ) that weakly reflects vertically polarized light . the reflection and transmission probabilities for 633 nm light were calculated ( and verified experimentally ) using the fresnel equations .",
    "the reflected photons are counted ; photons that pass through the window are projected onto a linear polarization state ( @xmath35 ) with a second polarizer ( p2 ) and also counted . as stated previously",
    ", each port has its own coupling efficiency and related losses .",
    "photons which are reflected from the front face of the window are collected and counted as @xmath146 .",
    "however , photons are also lost along the way . for example , they can be reflected from the back face of the window ( with @xmath147 ) , causing an additional backaction on the light which passes through the window .",
    "we thus change the definition of our conditional @xmath148 to include the probability of being measured at the first measurement step [ being reflected from the window s front face ] , conditional on [ not being reflected off the back face ] _ and _ [ not being being absorbed by p2 ] , i.e.  @xmath149 , where @xmath150 denotes the event of not being reflected off the back face .",
    "notably , the measured estimator @xmath151 , in fact , takes into account all such sources of loss .    from the recorded arrival times of the photons in each mode , we can separate photon detection events into time bins ; this allows for a determination of not only the average number of photons @xmath146 and @xmath152 but also their variances as we vary the input ( @xmath6 ) and post - selection ( @xmath35 ) states . to compare these values to theory , we plot the expected snr , incorporating the efficiencies of the experiment . for the data included here , we count photons for approximately 5s , with time bins of 150 @xmath153s or 25 ms for the null - wv or standard schemes , respectively . for technical reasons ,",
    "the photon flux for the standard scheme was higher than for the null - wv scheme ; however , the time bins are chosen to ensure that each method uses an equal number of prepared photons per _",
    "measurement_. we subtract dark counts , which constitute much less than 1% of the total counts on average .",
    "the deviation of the data from the theory plot is due to a small degree of ellipticity induced by the glass window possibly arising from an unknown optical coating or stress - induced birefringence .",
    "the linear polarization model giving rise to the theory plot of fig .  3 does not include complexity of this type .",
    "inclusion of a phase shift is straightforward and leads to a nearly perfect fit between theory and experiment @xcite .",
    "consequently , we expect that elimination of this ellipticity will result in an increased snr as suggested by the theory plot in fig .  3 .",
    "we also note that the experimental data in fig .",
    "3 has not been corrected for detector saturation effects .",
    "implementing this correction is also straightforward and contributes to the nearly perfect fit mentioned above ."

    "<S> the snr obtained by a nv signal proves to be higher than that obtained by single von neumann measurements . </S>",

    "<S> the respective probabilities are indicated : @xmath23 [ @xmath24 is the probability that the detector `` clicks '' [ no `` click '' ] upon the first measurement . if it does `` click '' , the system is destroyed , hence there are no clicks upon further measurements [ this is marked by a ( red ) @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> note that following @xmath26 ( null detection of the qubit ) , the back action rotates @xmath27 into @xmath28 . ]    </S>",

    "<S> our protocol takes advantage of the statistical correlations between the partial - collapse and strong measurements . to shed some light on its outcome </S>",
    "<S> we calculate explicitly the conditional probabilities following the measurement procedure sketched in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] . for example , if the first measurement results in a `` click '' the system s state is destroyed and any subsequent measurement on the system results in a null result . </S>",

    "<S> eq .  ] @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we focus on obtaining a large @xmath47 for discriminating between the two states . </S>",
    "<S> it depends on the choice of the measurement orientations , @xmath8 and @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to perform a first measurement that will have a back action on both states @xmath5 and @xmath6 but is nearby the optimal orientation of the single measurement case , i.e. taking @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> we propose two possible measurement schemes for obtaining a large @xmath49 . in the first scheme we choose the postselection such that the reference state satisfies @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the reference state @xmath5 would have always clicked in the second measurement had it not been first measured by the partial - collapse . </S>",
    "<S> we call this _ scheme * a*_. alternatively , in _ scheme * b * _ , we choose the postselection such that @xmath51 : the null outcome rotates the reference state and it always clicks in the second measurement . for both schemes , we obtain @xmath52}{\\sin[\\delta_m+\\delta]\\sqrt{p}}\\sqrt{n}\\,,\\ ] ] which becomes large for @xmath53 ( weak partial - collapse ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the condition @xmath54 is satisfied vis - a - vis the nv signal of the reference state . varying @xmath12 such that @xmath55 decreases corresponds to a decrease of @xmath56 and an increase of @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> a large @xmath49 is obtained when @xmath38 crosses to a regime where @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> this happens first with scheme * _ a_*. hence , scheme * _ a _ * produces a larger @xmath49 for smaller @xmath12 ; scheme * _ b _ * leads to far larger @xmath49 for larger @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> note , also , that taking the partial - collapse measurement to be more orthogonal to @xmath5 ( @xmath59 ) increases the snr for @xmath60 .    </S>",
    "<S> the postselection measurement orientations , which produce the high snr , coincide with those obtained in the single - copy analysis , i.e. @xmath61 , @xmath62 , for @xmath60 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that though the spirit of the present multicopy analysis is quite different from the single - copy analysis , both analyses give similar guidance for optimally discriminating between nonorthogonal states . </S>",
    "<S> we reiterate , however , that ( as compared with the single - copy approach ) the statistical snr approach ( based on nv ) is better suited to most experimental settings in which noise and experimental imperfections are present .     a sketch of the experimental apparatus . </S>",

    "<S> photons that pass through the window are then projected onto a linear polarization state with a second polarizer ( p2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the photons in each spatial mode are passed through colored glass filters to block background , collected via a multimode fiber and sent to single photon counting modules ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) . </S>",

    "<S> , the qubits are replaced by photons from a dramatically attenuated coherent beam , and the measurement device consists of polarization optics and single - photon detectors . </S>",
    "<S> we encode the states in the polarization degree of freedom by passing the beam through a polarizer ( p1 ) , giving @xmath66 { \\left|{0}\\right > } + \\sin[\\delta-\\delta_m]{\\left|{1}\\right>}$ ] , where @xmath67 correspond to the horizontal and vertical polarization states , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a ( weak ) partial - collapse measurement by sending the photons through a glass window ( w ) set at the brewster angle . </S>",
    "<S> the window therefore weakly reflects vertically polarized light , with probability @xmath68 , and passes horizontal light with near unit probability . </S>",
    "<S> we set the second polarizer ( p2 ) in the transmitted arm to strongly project the photon into the state @xmath35 which is represented by scheme * _ a _ * or * _ b _ * , as desired @xcite . from the resulting photon detections we obtain the values of @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 and their variances @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider schemes * _ a _ * and * _ b _ * for @xmath71 rad and plot the results in fig .  [ fig:3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , for scheme * _ a _ * , we can discriminate between the two states with a higher snr than the standard scheme nearly over the whole range of angles considered . similarly , while the snr of the standard technique almost coincides with that of scheme * _ b _ * for small angles , we see that the sensitivity of the two schemes diverges quickly for larger angles ; in this regime ( @xmath72 ) , the nv scheme * _ b _ * is significantly better . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy between theory and experiment is due to a small amount of ellipticity incurred from the glass window not included in the theory plot @xcite .     a graph of the theoretical and experimental snr obtained for different measurement schemes . </S>",

    "<S> the described nv procedure leading to large snr is based on the conditional outcome of a quantum measurement . as such , it resembles the well - established protocol of wv measurement  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> this property has been exploited for amplifying small signals both in quantum optics  @xcite and in solid state physics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to stress that the nv protocol is different from the wv protocol . the former makes use of a partial - collapse measurement of the operator @xmath76 , in which the system experiences back action only for a subset of all possible measurement outcomes , while a strong projection takes place for the remaining outcomes </S>",
    "<S> this is not a weak measurement , which is used by the wv protocol . </S>",

    "<S> it is quantitatively different from the wv even when @xmath80 is explicitly `` weak '' @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , while a large wv leads to an amplification of the snr for systems where the noise is dominated by an external ( technical ) component  @xcite , the method presented here leads to high fidelity discrimination between quantum states on the background of quantum fluctuations .    in conclusion </S>",

    "<S> our protocol enables one to discern between quantum states with better accuracy than a standard measurement would allow . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast to earlier protocols  @xcite tuned to discriminate between two prescribed states , the present one facilitates the study of an amplified snr for a wide range of possible polarizations of one of the states , which is not _ a priori _ known . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of our protocol by employing an optical setup for discriminating between different polarization states of light . </S>",
