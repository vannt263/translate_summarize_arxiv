    "jet observables , event shapes and jet rates , revealed themselves as one of the richest laboratories to explore qcd .",
    "being infrared and collinear safe ( irc ) , they can be predicted with perturbative ( pt ) techniques , but their high sensitivity to low energy emissions allows us to investigate the fairly unknown non - perturbative regime .",
    "most discriminatory studies make use of distributions . in integrated distributions",
    "@xmath0 one requires that the value of the observable @xmath1  a function of all secondary final state momenta @xmath2 and of the born momenta after recoil from the emissions @xmath3  be less than a fixed value @xmath4 @xmath5 the inclusive phase space region , where @xmath6 , is dominated by events with hard jets , which move the value of the observable far away from its born value , @xmath7 .",
    "these events can be described with fixed order pt expansions , however they are quite rare , every additional jet being suppressed by an additional factor of @xmath8 .",
    "more common events are characterised by a large number of soft - collinear emissions which modify only slightly the value of the observable from its born value , so that @xmath9 . here",
    "fixed order predictions fail since every power of @xmath8 is accompanied by up to two large logarithms @xmath10 of the value of the observable . a reorganization of the pt expansion is then needed in order to resum all leading ( ll , @xmath11 ) and next - to - leading ( nll , @xmath12 ) logarithmic terms .",
    "in the past few years the analytical resummation for a variety of observables have been presented in @xmath13-collision@xcite and dis@xcite .",
    "the matching of resummed predictions with fixed order results allowed tests of qcd , measures of the coupling constant and studies of non - perturbative corrections@xcite .",
    "however , the need for a separate analytical calculation for every observable has limited the experimental use of resummed predictions .",
    "when dealing with multi - jet observables , analytical calculations become quite unfeasible , involving many integral transforms in order to write the distribution in a factorized form@xcite . also in some cases it turns out not to be possible to resum the observable analytically@xcite .",
    "we present then here a general approach to resummation based on a preliminary automated analysis of the observable , to establish its relevant properties with respect to soft - collinear emissions ; in a subsequent step this information is used as an input of a general master formula .",
    "we start by considering a born event consisting of @xmath14 hard partons ( ` legs ' ) , @xmath15 of which are incoming , with momenta @xmath16 .",
    "we resum @xmath17-jet observables in the @xmath14-jet limit .",
    "the ( positive defined ) observable should then    1 .",
    "vanish smoothly as a single extra ( @xmath14+@xmath18 ) parton of momentum @xmath19 is made soft and collinear to a leg @xmath20 , with the functional dependence @xmath21 here @xmath22 is a hard scale of the process and the secondary emission @xmath19 is defined in terms of its transverse momentum @xmath23 and rapidity @xmath24 with respect to leg @xmath20 , and where relevant , by an azimuthal angle @xmath25 relative to a born event plane . by requiring the functional form ( in practise , almost always valid ) , the problem of analyzing the observable reduces in part to identifying , for each leg @xmath20 , the coefficients @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and the function @xmath29 .",
    "irc safety demands @xmath30 .",
    "2 .   be _ recursively _ irc safe , i.  e.  given an ensemble of arbitrarily soft and collinear emissions , the addition of a relatively much softer or more collinear emission should not significantly alter the value of the observable , condition required for exponentiation of the leading logarithms .",
    "observables like jet - rates in the jade algorithm are then excluded , and many other examples of non - exponentiating irc safe observables exist@xcite .",
    "3 .   be continuously global@xcite  this means that for a single soft emission , the observable s parametric dependence on the emission s transverse momentum ( with respect to the nearest leg ) should be independent of the emission direction . in practice",
    "this is perhaps the most restrictive of the conditions .",
    "it implies @xmath31 .    to enable our computer program caesar ( computer automated expert semi - analytical resummation ) to establish these properties with the desired degree of reliability and precision ,",
    "we have found it useful to make use of multiple - precision arithmetic@xcite .      given the above conditions",
    ", one can derive the following nll master resummation formula for the distribution @xmath0@xcite",

    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 are relevant only at nll level @xmath44    the process dependence associated with large - angle soft radiation is described by @xmath45 , whose form depends on the number @xmath14 of legs . for @xmath46 @xmath47",

    "the simpler case @xmath52 can be read from setting @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath54 formulae apply then to @xmath13 , dis and drell - yan production , while a process such as @xmath55 involves simply different color factors .",
    "the ( more involved ) @xmath56 case needed to describe hadronic dijet production can be found in@xcite .",
    "we examine now the factor @xmath57 . without it ,",
    ".   corresponds essentially to the probability of vetoing all emissions @xmath19 with @xmath58 .",
    "however at nll subtle effects enter : a simple veto on _ single emissions _ turns out to be insufficient , since events might have @xmath59 though all emissions separately had @xmath60 , or vice versa .",
    "this _ multiple emission _ effect , encoded in @xmath57 , is connected to how all secondary emission coherently determine the value of the observable and can be computed in a general way in@xcite .    while this talk concentrates on the method ,",
    "new results obtained with it were presented at this conference in@xcite ( and other results can be found in@xcite ) .",
    "this project started with the development of an algorithm to numerically compute the non - trivial nll terms associated with multiple emissions .",
    "it was initially applied by hand to three new observables [ 6 ] .",
    "progress since then includes the derivation of a general master formula , together with a precise , automatically verifiable list of conditions on the observable for the resummation to be valid at nll and the full numerical implementation of this . though no human intervention is needed , results have the quality of analytic nll predictions , so that any hadronisation model can be applied , studies of renormalization and factorization scale dependence can be carried out and a matching with fixed order is feasible .",
    "the most import results obtained up to now are the first resummations in hadronic dijet production , for a variety of observable at a time .",
    "we now aim at automating the matching with fixed order results@xcite , this will open up the possibility to carry out a vast amount of phenomenological studies .",
