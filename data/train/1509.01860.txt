    "branching processes are powerful stochastic models that describe the evolution of populations of individuals which reproduce and die independently of each other according to specific probability laws .",
    "they are playing an increasingly important role in models of population biology including molecular biology , ecology , epidemiology , and evolutionary theory @xcite , as well as in other scientific areas such as particle physics , chemistry , and computer science @xcite .",
    "typical performance measures of these models include the distribution of the instantaneous and cumulative population sizes at a given time , the extinction probability of a population , and its asymptotic growth rate and composition .    in order to apply branching processes to real - world problems ,",
    "the parameters of the model must be estimated from available data sets .",
    "small errors or changes in the parameters may lead to notably different model outputs .",
    "a sensitivity analysis may quantify the impact of each parameter on the performance measures of the model",
    ". this may be useful if we want to know which parameters influence the growth of the branching process the most .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , sensitivity analysis has received scant attention in the branching processes literature . apart from a few papers dealing with very specific questions such as @xcite and @xcite , there is no complete study of the topic for more general classes of branching processes .",
    "here we consider a continuous - time markovian branching process evolving on a fixed network .",
    "such a process belongs to the class of _ markovian trees _ , which can be seen as particular multitype branching processes , and offer considerable modelling versatility and appealing computational properties , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the concept of a branching process evolving on a network is certainly not new , but our aim in this paper is to present branching processes and their properties in an accessible way , and to show how to derive practical , analytic sensitivity formulas for the main quantities of interest . for that purpose",
    ", we first discuss the typical performance measures of the model ( as listed earlier ) , and we then perform an analytical sensitivity analysis of each performance measure with respect to the model parameters .",
    "as opposed to the performance measures themselves , most of the sensitivity formulas have an explicit expression that can be easily used in practical situations .",
    "we then illustrate our theoretical sensitivity results on a topical real - world problem : the spread of an influenza - like epidemic on a network of cities in the united states through air traffic .",
    "it is well known that the early stages of an epidemic can be approximated by a branching process @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the averaged branching process is essentially the linearisation of the nonlinear _ susceptible - infected - removed _ ( _ sir _ ) compartmental model around the disease - free equilibrium .",
    "we refer to hethcote @xcite and the book of keeling and rohani @xcite for a good introduction to the modeling of infectious diseases , to arino @xcite for an overview on diseases in metapopulations , and to balcan et al .",
    "@xcite for a recent computational model for the spatial spread of infectious diseases .",
    "the sources of errors in the outputs of a model of epidemic evolving on a network are manifold .",
    "they may arise either from the simplifying assumptions of the model , which necessarily neglect many features of the real world , or from imprecise epidemiological or mobility data .",
    "the former is addressed in the most sophisticated models by taking into account a large number of explanatory variables or compartments , such as age , gender , location , etc . , and modeling the dynamics in a complex nonlinear way .",
    "the mobility data , at a global level or at the level of a large country such as the united states , is often estimated from the number of passengers flying from one airport to the other .",
    "these data are easily available and are assumed to account for a large part of the mobility .",
    "a discussion on the relevance of these data is included in @xcite .",
    "the epidemiological data are however much harder to estimate accurately . for instance , the average number of infectious contacts that an individual infected by seasonal influenza makes in a day have been estimated to range from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , see @xcite .",
    "sensitivity of epidemic models to parameters has already been studied for different types of diseases : hyman and laforce @xcite studied the sensitivity of a multi - city deterministic epidemic model for influenza with respect to the epidemiological data .",
    "they assumed that the transmission and recovery rates are the same in each city and show that the recovery rate is the most important single parameter .",
    "_ @xcite perform a sensitivity analysis on a non - linear compartmental model of malaria transmission , and obtain an analytical formula for the basic reproduction number @xmath2 and for its sensitivity .    in this paper , we compute the sensitivity of the branching process approximation with respect to both epidemiological and domestic mobility data .",
    "we find that the results are significantly more sensitive with respect to the epidemiological data than with respect to the domestic mobility data .",
    "this provides confidence in the use of the general approximation of domestic mobility by airport traffic , but suggests that the most stringent limitation of current models is in the relatively imprecise epidemiological data , rather than in the sophistication of the model or the estimation of domestic traffic .",
    "this is in contrast with the role of international air travel , which can have a more important impact on the development of some diseases such as h1n1 @xcite .    finally , we refine our sensitivity analysis with respect to the epidemiological parameters by studying the effect of a vaccination campaign .",
    "the sensitivity analysis of the epidemic size with respect to the vaccination rate allows us to compute a practically relevant quantity : the impact of each supplementary vaccination shot on the total number of infected people , when the vaccination has succeeded in stopping the exponential spreading of the disease . in this regime",
    "the stochastic branching process approximation is valid at all times @xcite .    in an appendix",
    ", we also introduce the possibility of on - board transmission .",
    "infection during transportation has been analyzed from a theoretical point of view for the _ sir _ model in @xcite , but the authors have not applied the model to real situations .",
    "studies on the transmission rates on board airplanes exist ( see for instance the report of the european centre for disease prevention and control @xcite ) , however , to the best of our knowledge , data are not sufficient to provide accurate on - board transmission functions for influenza .",
    "therefore we assume that the transmission probabilities are given by a specific function of the flight time , and we show how this assumption affects the sensitivity results .",
    "we show in particular that considering on - board transmission can noticeably modify the shape of the sensitivity curves .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the model of branching process evolving on a network and we discuss several performance measures which can be computed from the model . in section 3",
    ", we define the sensitivity and the elasticity of a model output with respect to a parameter , and we derive analytical expressions for the sensitivity of each performance measure discussed in section 2 .",
    "we end the section by an illustration of the sensitivity results on a simple artificial example . in section 4 , we apply the sensitivity results on a model for the early spread of an influenza - like epidemic on a network of cities in the united states . finally , we introduce vaccination and perform a sensitivity analysis with respect to the proportion of vaccinated people .",
    "we conclude our paper in section 5 .",
    "the technical details and supplementary information are provided in six appendices .    throughout the paper , column vectors",
    "are denoted by @xmath3 and row vectors are denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "the column vector @xmath5 denotes the unit vector with a 1 at the @xmath6th entry and zeros elsewhere , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are column vectors of which all elements are respectively equal to one and zero ; the size of these vectors is generally clear from the context .",

    "we define a continuous - time stochastic model of a population evolving on the network as follows .",
    "the process starts at time 0 with a single individual located at node @xmath15 .",
    "one of the following three types of event may then happen to this individual while at node @xmath6 :    * the individual moves from @xmath6 to an adjacent node @xmath16 ; this happens at rate @xmath17 ( that is , @xmath17 transitions from @xmath6 to @xmath12 occur on average per time unit , per individual at node @xmath6 ) .",
    "* the individual gives birth to @xmath18 children ( @xmath19 ) and simultaneously moves to node @xmath12 adjacent to @xmath6 , the @xmath18 children respectively starting their life at nodes @xmath20 , @xmath21 adjacent to @xmath6 ; this happens at rate @xmath22 .",
    "* the individual dies ; this happens at rate @xmath23 .",
    "all individuals living on the network behave independently of each other with the same rules as the initial individual .",
    "the transition rates , birth rates and death rates are gathered respectively in a @xmath24 matrix @xmath25 , a sequence of @xmath26 matrices @xmath27 , @xmath19 , and an @xmath28 vector @xmath29 .",
    "the diagonal elements of @xmath30 are strictly negative and @xmath31 is the parameter of the exponential distribution of the sojourn time of an individual at node @xmath6 before one of the three abovementioned events occurs .",
    "these elements are computed such that the matrices and vector satisfy @xmath32 .",
    "the resulting markovian population process is a branching process characterized by the set of matrices @xmath33 belonging to the class of _ markovian trees _ , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we illustrate the structure of the matrices @xmath34 and @xmath35 on the simplest network with @xmath36 ( adjacent ) nodes . the @xmath37 transition rate matrix @xmath30 is then given by @xmath38,\\ ] ] where the diagonal entries @xmath39 will be described further .",
    "assume that the individuals of the branching process can give birth to at most two children at each birth event .",
    "this means that the birth rate matrices @xmath40 are nonzero only for @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
