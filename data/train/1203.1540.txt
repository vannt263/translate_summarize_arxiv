    "compressible flow problems are usually solved by conservative schemes . high - order conservative schemes are suitable for simulating flows with both shock waves and rich flow features ( acoustic waves , turbulence ) since they are capable of handling flow discontinuities and accurately resolve a broad range of length scales .",
    "one important issue of high - order conservative schemes is that non - physical negative density or pressure ( failure of positivity ) can lead to an ill - posed system , which may cause blow - ups of the numerical solution . while for some first - order schemes negative density or pressure can occur when a vacuum or near vacuum is reached , for higher - order conservative schemes positivity failure can also occur due to interpolation errors at or near very strong discontinuities even though the flow physically is far away from vacuum .",
    "it is known that many first order godunov - type schemes @xcite have the so called positivity - preserving property and can maintain positive density and pressure .",
    "it has been also proved that some second - order conservative schemes @xcite are positivity - preserving with or without a more restrictive courant - friedrichs - lewy ( cfl ) condition . for even higher - order conservative schemes , perthame and",
    "shu @xcite proved that , given a first - order positivity - preserving scheme , such as godunov - type schemes , one can always build a higher - order positivity - preserving finite volume scheme under the following constraints : ( a ) the cell - face values for the numerical flux calculation have positive density and pressure , ( b ) additional limits on the interpolation under a more restrictive cfl - like condition . with a different interpretation of these constraints based on certain gauss - lobatto quadratures ,",
    "positivity - preserving methods have been successfully developed for high - order discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) methods @xcite and weighted essentially non - oscillatory ( weno ) finite volume and finite difference schemes @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an alternative method to enforce the positivity - preserving property with a simple cut - off flux limiter .",
    "the flux limiter first detects critical numerical fluxes which may lead to negative density and pressure , then limits these fluxes to satisfy a sufficient condition for preserving positivity . unlike the approaches in @xcite , in which positivity - preserving and the maintenance of high order accuracy are considered simultaneously when designing the limiter , here we design the cut - off flux limiter to satisfy positivity only , and then prove _ a posteriori _ the maintenance of high order accuracy under a time step restriction .",
    "it appears that , in our numerical experiments , a much less restrictive time - step size condition is sufficient for preserving positivity without destroying overall accuracy .",
    "an advantage of the approach in this paper is that the cut - off limiter is directly applied to the numerical flux and it can be applied to arbitrary high - order conservative schemes .",
