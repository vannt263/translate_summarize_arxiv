    "in the real world the concept of `` isolated system '' is an abstraction and idealization .",
    "it was constructed to help understand some phenomena displayed by real systems which may be regarded as approximately isolated .",
    "since dissipation is a macroscopic concept , there has been little interest in it during the initial development of quantum mechanics .",
    "but , since about 40 years dissipation has been incorporated into the quantum description to make possible the understanding of processes such as ionization of atoms , radiation fields inside a cavity or simply the decoherence caused by the interaction between a system and its surroundings .",
    "the recent advances in technology that have made possible to construct and preserve quantum states , have also opened the possibility of building quantum computing devices @xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of the dynamics of open quantum systems becomes relevant both for development of these technologies as well as for the algorithms that will run on those future quantum computers .",
    "grover s quantum search algorithm @xcite , which locates a marked item in an unsorted list of @xmath0 elements in a number of steps proportional to @xmath1 , instead of the @xmath2 of the classical counterpart , is one of the more studied .",
    "this search algorithm has also a continuous time version @xcite that has been described as the analog analogue of the original grover algorithm .",
    "we have recently developed a new way to generate a continuous time quantum search algorithm @xcite . in that work",
    "we have built a search algorithm with continuous time that finds a discrete eigenstate of a given hamiltonian @xmath3 , if its eigenenergy is given .",
    "this resonant algorithm behaves like grovers s , and its efficiency depends on the spectral density of the hamiltonian @xmath3 .",
    "a connection between the continuous and discrete time versions of the search algorithm was also established , and it was explicitly shown that such a quantum search algorithm is essentially a resonance between the initial and the searched state .",
    "recently @xcite the response of grover s algorithm to decoherences has been analyzed . here",
    "a similar study on our proposal for a quantum search algorithm is performed .",
    "we rapidly review this method in the following section , and then proceed to study how this resonant algorithm can be affected by some interactions with the environment , as follows . in section 3 ,",
    "we subject the system to a monochromatic external field , and , in section 4 , decoherences are introduced by performing a series of measurements .",
    "conclusions are drawn in the last section of this work .",
    "let us consider the normalized eigenstates @xmath4 for a hamiltonian @xmath3 . consider a subset * n * of @xmath5 the unknown searched state in * n * whose energy @xmath6 is given .",
    "we assume it is the only state in * n * with that value of the energy , so knowing @xmath6 is equivalent to `` marking '' the searched state in grover s algorithm .    in the resonant quantum search algorithm a potential @xmath7 , that produces the coupling between the initial and the searched states ,",
    "is defined as @xcite @xmath8 where the eigenstate @xmath9 , with eigenvalue @xmath10 , is the initial state of the system .",
    "this initial state is chosen so as not to belong to the subset * n*. above , @xmath11 is an unitary vector which can be interpreted as the average of the set of vectors in * n * , and @xmath12 .",

    "is solved .",
    "the wavefunction , @xmath16 , is expressed as an expansion in the eigenstates @xmath17 of @xmath3 , @xmath18 . the time dependent coefficients @xmath19 have initial conditions @xmath20 , @xmath21 for all @xmath22 .",
    "we take units such that @xmath23 .    after solving this equation , the probability distribution results in , @xmath24 where @xmath25 . from these equations",
    "it is clear that for @xmath26 a measurement has a probability of yielding the searched state very close to one .",
    "this approach is valid as long as all the bohr frequencies satisfy @xmath27 and , in this case , our method behaves qualitatively like grover s .",
    "the previous results have shown that the resonant search algorithm can be reduced to essentially a quantum system with two energy levels .",
    "this reminds us of the quantum optics problem of a two - level atom driven by a radiation field , and the question arises on how the algorithm behaves when an external field is interacting with it .",

    "the search algorithm we are studying makes a transition from the initial to essentially the sought state , other states being negligibly populated .",
    "thus , any measurement process will leave the system , with high probability , in one of these two states .",

    "we remark that eq.([coefficients1 ] ) implies that for a sufficiently large number of measurements , both @xmath98 and @xmath103 tend to @xmath104 , independently of the interval between measurements @xmath105 and the initial conditions .",

    "[ fig : sacando ] shows that the average value of @xmath98  over different number of measurements @xmath94 is also @xmath104 .",

    "the calculation based on the direct solution of the schrdinger equation is compared to the one obtained from eq.([coefficients2 ] ) , as a function of @xmath94 . besides the good agreement between the two calculations we notice that @xmath98 decreases with @xmath111 so that for @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "this simply means that the more frequently the wave function collapses , the harder it becomes for the algorithm to significantly depart from the initial state .",
    "therefore , in this case the algorithm behaves as an example of the quantum zeno effect , where the a high frequency of measurements hinders the departure of the system from its initial state @xcite .",
    "this also explains our previous assertion , that for the algorithm to be useful the time @xmath105 between measurements must not be too small .",
    "we have extended the study of the search algorithm presented in  @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that the algorithm was robust when the energy of the searched state had some imprecision . in this work ,",
    "the resonant algorithm was treated as an open system , and subject to two types of external interactions : an oscillating external field and measurement processes .",
    "it was shown that , although the algorithm is in general affected by a periodic external field , for extensive zones of the field parameter values it works with good efficiency . in the case of measurements , the probability distribution for the searched and initial states were obtained analytically .",
    "when a set of periodic measurements are performed , the probability distribution satisfies a master equation . in this way we have shown",
    "that the global behavior of the algorithm becomes a markovian process .",
    "therefore , the algorithm can still be useful in the case of repeated measurements , as long as they are not too frequent .",
    "we believe that these results may be directly extended to the grover algorithm .",
    "as it may be seen from the description of this algorithm in ref.@xcite , and as already pointed out by grover @xcite , this algorithm is essentially a resonance between the searched and the average state .",
    "one should also be aware that , while in the case of the grover algorithm care is needed to make sure that after each measurement the state of the system is reinitialized into the average state , this procedure is not required in the algorithm proposed in this work .",
