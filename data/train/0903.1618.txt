    ", situation might be different at the gb where the coordination of atoms differs both from that in the bulk of the grain and that at the free surface .    in order to check the segregation behavior of cr at the fe gbs we compared the total energy of the system with a single cr atom placed in one of the fe - layers adjacent to the boundary and that with cr atom in the middle ( bulk ) layer of the grain [ cf .",
    "( [ eq_8_segr ] ) ] .",
    "calculated segregation energies ( fig .  [ fig6_segreg_cr_in_fe ] ) show that cr atoms exhibit a clear tendency to enrich the gbs in fe .",
    "the same concentrations of cr , both per volume of the grain and per area of the boundary plane , applied in this work as well as in our previous work on free surfaces of the dilute fecr alloy,@xcite allow for a direct comparison of the segregation behavior of the two systems .",
    "in contrast to the free ( 111 ) and ( 210 ) iron surfaces where the enrichment by cr was found to be unfavored ( by @xmath70.20.3 ev),@xcite regardless the position of cr solute atom in the surface or subsurface fe layers , at the @xmath3(111 ) and @xmath4(210 ) gbs segregation is favorable in the first three layers of the fe grains .",
    "the segregation of cr is most pronounced in the first two layers closest to the boundary plane , where the energy of the enriched @xmath3 and @xmath4 gb is lowered approximately by @xmath450.1 and @xmath450.2 ev , respectively . for the @xmath5 boundary",
    "there exists a barrier for cr segregation at the third layer , where segregation becomes unfavorable .",
    "interestingly , we also found that having a monolayer of cr at the gb ( not shown ) is more favored ( by @xmath66 ev at the @xmath6 , and @xmath67 ev at the @xmath6 gb ) than to have it in the middle of the grain .",
    "it is worth noting that at the dilute concentration , fe atoms placed in the chromium grains @xcite preferably enrich the interface cr layers .",
    "figure  [ fig3:fe_mag - mom ] shows variations in the magnetic moment on atoms of the fe grains in the direction perpendicular to the gb , induced by a monolayer of cr .",
    "when the solute atom is placed near the @xmath653 gb , the moments on the fe atoms near the boundary are reduced by @xmath75% and show a larger amplitude of variations in the deeper layers .",
    "an asymmetric placement of the impurity with respect to the gb plane is reflected in the antisymmetric changes of the @xmath56 . for the lower cr concentration ( not shown ) the changes in the moments are smaller . at the @xmath655",
    "gb the amplitude of the @xmath56 variations is generally increased compared to the pure boundary but in some layers the directions of variation are reversed , depending on the situation of the cr atom .    the variations in the magnetic moment on cr impurity ( @xmath68 ) placed in different sites in the two differently oriented fe grains are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7:cr_in_fe_mag - mom ]",
    ". a minus sign of the @xmath68 means that it is coupled antiparallel to the moments on the neighboring fe atoms . independently of the orientation of the grains ,",
    "deep in the fe interior the @xmath68 attains @xmath451.4 and @xmath451.7 @xmath57 , for a monolayer of cr and a lower cr concentrations , respectively .",
    "these values are much higher than 0.59 @xmath57 which is characteristic for the bulk bcc cr crystal.@xcite they agree very well with the results reported by klaver _ _ et al.__@xcite for the interior of the dilute fecr alloys . for a single cr atom in the bulk fe they obtained the magnetic moment of @xmath69 , and for a cr atom with one additional cr in the neighborhood @xmath70 .",
    "this may be an indication of the fact that for smaller cr concentration in the grains the cr - cr repulsive interaction resulting from magnetic frustration is very small or even negligible .",
    "as one can see the behavior of the magnetic moment at the two gbs is different .",
    "while at the @xmath3 gb the local @xmath68 varies rather moderately , between @xmath451.4 and @xmath451.7 @xmath57 , except the case of cr at the boundary plane ( l0 ) where it achieves @xmath71 @xmath57 , at the @xmath4(210 ) gb the variations span the range from @xmath72 to @xmath71 @xmath57 , and are largest on the cr placed substitutionally . at lower cr concentration ( 1 cr per @xmath49 cell )",
    "the moment on cr in the very boundary plane ( l0 ) , or in the second layer ( l2 ) of the grain , approaches the values of @xmath452.2 and @xmath452.4 @xmath57 , respectively , i.e. , it is equal or even exceeds that on fe atoms in the interior of fe crystal . at the @xmath73",
    "gb the changes of the @xmath68 are very alike for the two examined cr concentration and differ by @xmath70.3 @xmath57 which can be attributed to the cr - cr repulsion resulting from the magnetic frustration .",

    "the magnetic moment on the bulk fe atom is 2.24 @xmath57.,width=8 ]    the magnetic properties of gbs atoms are very sensitive to their local environment . in the stoner theory @xcite of itinerant magnetism the origin of a ferromagnetic order is explained by a rigid shift of the spin - up and spin - down bands under the influence of the exchange interaction .",
    "the ratio of this exchange splitting to the local magnetic moment ( the stoner parameter ) plays an essential role in determining magnetic behavior of the system .",
    "its empirical value was found to be quite universal and close to 1 ev/@xmath57 for a wide class of magnetic systems.@xcite recently , it was shown that exactly the same linear correlation holds also for the atoms of fe grains around the clean @xmath4(310 ) boundary.@xcite on the other hand , earlier theoretical studies have reported a slightly lower proportionality ratio of 0.92 to 0.95 ev/@xmath57 for the fe - atom sites in the intermetallic systems.@xcite calculated as the difference in the centers of gravity of the local density of states for spin - up and spin - down electrons @xcite the stoner parameter for fe atoms at the distorted gb can be plotted versus the local magnetic moments on the respective atoms ( fig .",
    "[ fig8:exch_split_fe ] ) .",
    "the respective dependencies for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 gb - atoms , can be approximated by the linear least - squares fits @xmath74 + 0.16 , and @xmath75 .",

    "[ fig8:exch_split_fe ] ) is larger for the @xmath4 which is more distorted than the @xmath3(111 ) .",
    "similar relations , though with slightly smaller slopes ( 0.88 ev/@xmath57 and 0.90 ev/@xmath57 for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 gbs , respectively ) hold also when moments on cr solute atoms are included .",
    "thus , at the gbs in iron with cr additions the magnetic order is primarily ruled by the magnetism in fe and can be described by stoner s model of ferromagnetism .",
    "in this work we have investigated from first principles the structural , cohesive , and magnetic properties of two high - angle tilt grain boundaries in iron , the @xmath3(111 ) and @xmath4 ( 210 ) , with a small amount of cr additions . at clean the gbs the interplanar distances in the grains",
    "are greatly enhanced . full relaxation of the system caused a substantial parallel shift of the @xmath4(210 ) grains , while the @xmath3 gb remained unreconstructed . the formation of the clean @xmath3 gb , where one - in - three gb atoms coincide , costs more energy than to create the @xmath4 with one - in - five - atoms coincidence .",
    "the magnetic moments on fe atoms at the gb exhibit an oscillatory variation with the atomic layer depth .",
    "the chromium additions placed substitutionally do not change much the relaxation pattern , whereas interstitial cr increases greatly the interlayer distances , and consequently enhances the grains excess volume per unit area up to four times .",
    "a monolayer of the substitutional cr enhances cohesion at the @xmath3 gb , while at smaller concentration it is neutral",
    ". added at the @xmath4 gb chromium strengthens the gb .",
    "a decomposition of the strengthening energy shows that responsible for the cohesion enhancement are the changes in the bonding at the gb . both for cr substituted into",
    "the fe matrix and the interstitial cr , the chemical contribution , resulting from the electron charge redistribution , dominates alone and causes the gb strengthening .",
    "placed at the gb interstice , cr has a beneficial effect on the cohesion , the strengthening being stronger for a monolayer concentration .",
    "we have shown that unlike the free fe surfaces , the enrichment of iron gbs by dilute cr is energetically favorable .",
    "the magnetic moment on the host fe atoms is generally reduced when the cr - solute atoms are present while the moment on the cr - solute is much increased compared to that in a cr crystal .",
    "it is demonstrated that the magnetic order at the gbs in iron ( both clean and with cr additions ) can be explained by the stoner model relating the local magnetic moments to the amount of exchange - splitting in the bands .",
