    "the effect of spin - orbit coupling is well known from elementary quantum mechanics and atomic physics : it arises from the interaction between the spin of an electron in an atom and the magnetic field created by the orbiting nucleus in the rest frame of the electron .",
    "this magnetic field is related to the electric field created by the nucleus in its rest frame .",
    "if this field is a spherical electrostatic field , the interaction hamiltonian is given by @xmath0 here , as usual , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the spin and orbital momentum operators for the electron , @xmath3 and @xmath4 stand for the electron charge and mass , @xmath5 is the speed of light in the vacuum and @xmath6 is the electrostatic potential of the atomic nucleus . for one - electron atom ,",
    "the formula is exact , otherwise @xmath6 can be thought as an approximation to an average radial potential experienced by the electron .",
    "equation is obtained in the non - relativistic limit ( electron velocity is small compared to @xmath5  see , for instance , @xcite ) and so it is used in the non - relativistic description of an electron , i.e. , by adding it to the hamiltonian in the schrdinger equation .    in this paper",
    "we propose to examine a similar coupling that arises due to the relativistic treatment of the electron ( i.e. using the dirac equation ) _ even in the absence of an external field_. this is a consequence of the linearity of the dirac equation in the space derivatives ( and thus in the linear momentum operator @xmath7 ) and from the related fact that one needs a 4-component spinor to describe the electron .",
    "we will make the relativistic nature of this coupling apparent by solving the dirac equation in an infinite spherical potential well .",
    "although the particle motion inside the well is free , the relativistic @xmath8 coupling exists and vanishes only in the non - relativistic limit , which we are able to approach continuously by varying the well radius . in this limit",
    "the two - component spinor description is valid .",
    "a comparison between relativistic and non - relativistic solutions was already studied in @xcite for a one - dimensional infinite square well potential . in the present paper",
    "we use the same procedures as in @xcite to provide a bridge between known relativistic and non - relativistic solutions in the 3-dimensional spherical case , with special emphasis on the @xmath8 coupling .",
    "berry and mondragon @xcite have also applied similar methods in the framework of the dirac equation in two spatial dimensions .    in section 2",
    "we pedagogically review the solutions of the free dirac equation with spherical symmetry , in a slightly different fashion from the usual treatments , emphasizing the role of the @xmath8 coupling term and its consequences for the set of quantum numbers of the solution . in section 3",
    "we solve the dirac equation for a spherical potential well and compare it to the non - relativistic solution of the corresponding schrdinger equation for several well radii .",
    "technical details , included for completeness , are mostly left to appendices .",
    "the free dirac equation for a spin-@xmath9 particle with mass @xmath3 is a matrix equation for 4-component spinors @xmath10 given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the linear momentum operator , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 , in the usual representation , are the @xmath15 matrices @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the @xmath18 unit matrix and @xmath19 denotes the three pauli matrices @xmath20 obeying the relations @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the anti - symmetric levi - civita tensor ( @xmath23 ) and summation over repeated indexes is implied .    using we can obtain the following general property of the @xmath24 matrices @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are two arbitrary vectors whose components commute with the matrices @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the 4-dimensional analog of the pauli matrices . using and @xmath30 ( here , of course , @xmath17 stands for the @xmath31 unit matrix ) , one can write @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the orbital angular momentum operator . inserting into the dirac equation we get @xmath36 since the spin angular momentum operator in the dirac formalism is @xmath37 the last expression contains a term involving the dot product @xmath38 as in the spin - orbit term .",
    "this term is responsible for the @xmath8 coupling for a relativistic spin-@xmath9 particle even in the absence of an external potential .",
    "clearly this fact is connected to the spinor structure of the wave function for spin-@xmath9 particles and to the linearity of the dirac equation , which leads to the appearance of the term @xmath39 . in the klein - gordon equation , which is quadratic in the space derivatives , there is no such coupling .",
    "we can gain further insight into the origin of this effect if we write the spinor @xmath10 in as a set of two - component spinors @xmath40 and @xmath41 :",
    "@xmath42 from the block off - diagonal form of the @xmath28 matrices one sees that the term @xmath39 mixes the spinors @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in the literature ( see , for instance , bjorken and drell @xcite ) this kind of term is referred to as  odd \" as opposed to the terms like @xmath43 which are called  even \" , since they do nt mix upper and lower two - component spinors .",
    "this distinction is important when one goes to the non - relativistic limit of the dirac equation using the foldy - wouthuysen transformation @xcite which aims at eliminating the odd terms through a unitary transformation and so decouple the upper and lower spinors . in this way",
    "one can regain the ( pauli ) non - relativistic description of a spin-@xmath9 particle .",
    "the fact that the term responsible for the @xmath8 coupling is odd indicates that this relativistic effect is related to the four - component spinor structure , i.e. , to the existence of two non - zero spinor components @xmath40 and @xmath41 of the wave function .",
    "this will be shown in the following .",
    "let us consider the stationary solutions of the dirac equation by writing the spinor @xmath10 in the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the total ( kinetic plus rest ) energy of the fermion .",
    "inserting this expression into we get two equations for the spinors @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xmath48 from these equations the @xmath8 coupling of the spinors @xmath46 and @xmath47 becomes apparent .",
    "let us consider solutions with spherical symmetry of these equations . in appendix",
    "a a derivation slightly different from the one used in most textbooks is presented .",
    "it is shown that the spinors can be written as products of a radial and an angular function as @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 being a non - zero quantum number which has a different sign according to the way the spin couples to the orbital angular momentum ( see ) . since @xmath52 the whole spinor @xmath10 is not an eigenstate of the orbital angular momentum operator @xmath53 .",
    "the good quantum numbers are @xmath54 ( total angular momentum quantum number ) , @xmath55 , @xmath3 ( see appendix a ) and parity .",
    "this is due to the @xmath8 term mentioned above .",
    "it is interesting to look at the non - relativistic limit of the equation .",
    "if we divide it by @xmath56 , we obtain @xmath57 using the fact that @xmath58 . in the non - relativistic limit , the linear momenta of the dominant plane - wave components of @xmath47 ( obtained through a fourier decomposition ) are much smaller than @xmath59 , which implies , from , that @xmath46 disappears in that limit .",
    "since the angular part of @xmath46 contains only geometrical information , we can conclude ( see equation ) that @xmath60 vanishes in the non - relativistic limit and one recovers the two - component spinor description of a spin-@xmath61 particle .",
    "interestingly enough , in the ultra - relativistic limit , where @xmath62 , we can again recover the two - component description , since in this case we can choose the spinors @xmath47 and @xmath46 to be eigenstates of the helicity operator @xmath63 where @xmath64 , with eigenvalues @xmath65 , as can be seen from equations and .",
    "this implies that @xmath66 and therefore we may construct two two - component spinors for each value of the helicity ( see , for instance , itzykson and zuber @xcite ) .",
    "if we differentiate once the coupled first order differential equations for @xmath67 and @xmath60 derived in appendix a ( equations and ) , one gets @xmath68 notice that , although in each equation only @xmath69 or @xmath70 appear explicitly , the radial functions depend also on @xmath54 through the energy @xmath45 .",
    "these are the differential equations which have to be solved in order to get the radial functions @xmath67 and @xmath60 .    in the non - relativistic limit ,",
    "since @xmath60 vanishes , @xmath69 is again a good quantum number , i.e. , the @xmath8 coupling disappears .",
    "moreover , since in this case @xmath67 only depends on @xmath69 , we can construct the standard non - relativistic solution taking the linear combination    @xmath71    where we dropped the index @xmath54 in the radial function and used the definition of @xmath72 and an orthogonality property of the clebsch - gordan coefficients .    the differential equations and",
    "can be extended to include interactions with spherical external potentials @xmath6 and @xmath73 , which are respectively a time component of a four - vector ( affecting the energy ) and a lorentz scalar ( affecting the mass ) .",
    "this is done by the replacements @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "in order to show numerically the relativistic nature of the @xmath8 coupling described in the preceding section , we are going now to compute the positive energy solutions of the dirac equation for an infinite spherical well . as we will show",
    ", we can go , in a natural way , from a relativistic to a non - relativistic situation by changing the radius of the potential .",
    "the boundary conditions at the wall of the potential provide a discrete energy spectrum which allows a clear picture of the non - relativistic limit .    to solve the dirac equation in such a potential",
    ", one has to avoid any complications due to the negative energy states when trying to localize a spin-@xmath61 particle within a distance of the order of its compton wavelength @xmath76 or less ( this is the case for confined relativistic particles ) , one example of which is the klein paradox ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in other words ,",
    "we want to retain the rle of the dirac equation as a one - particle equation in the presence of a infinite external potential .",
    "this is accomplished by defining a lorentz scalar potential , i.e. , a mass - like potential , having the form @xmath77 where @xmath3 is the mass of the particle .",
    "the effect of this potential is to prevent the particle from propagating outside the well , meaning that its wave function is identically zero there .",
    "inside , it behaves as a free particle of mass @xmath3 .",
    "a potential like , usually with @xmath78 , has been used to describe confined quarks as constituents of the nucleon in the mit bag model ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review of this and related models ) .",
    "the boundary condition for the wave function at the boundary ( @xmath79 ) can not be obtained by requiring its continuity , since , being the dirac equation a first - order differential equation , the potential implies that there is an infinite jump in the derivative of @xmath10 ( i.e. , in the radial derivatives of @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) when the boundary of the well is crossed .",
    "this jump obviously would not exist if @xmath10 were continuous .",
    "another and most natural alternative is to demand that the probability current flux at the boundary is zero . as it is shown in @xcite , this is also a necessary condition to assure the hermiticity of the kinetic part of the dirac hamiltonian within the well .",
    "this can be achieved by the condition @xmath82 in fact , if one multiplies this equation on the left by @xmath83 and its hermitian conjugate on the right by @xmath84 one gets @xmath85 and @xmath86 at @xmath79 .",
    "these two equations imply that @xmath87 and @xmath88 are zero at @xmath79 .",
    "the expression @xmath88 can also be written as @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the probability current density for the particle described by the wave function @xmath10 . instead of the current flux we can look at the value of @xmath87 at the boundary : indeed , since @xmath10 is zero for @xmath91",
    ", we may as well summarize the effect of the boundary condition by saying that @xmath87 is continuous for any value of @xmath92 .",
    "having established the boundary condition , we proceed now to compute the radial functions .",
    "this is done in appendix c. the full spinor @xmath10 reads @xmath93 where @xmath94 is determined from normalization .",
    "in order to obtain the energy spectrum , we apply the boundary condition to the spinor .",
    "this gives rise to an equation relating the two radial functions ( see appendix c ) @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "it can be written , in a more convenient way , in terms of the scaled quantities @xmath97 and @xmath98 , with @xmath99 .",
    "these are the kinetic energy in units of @xmath100 and the well radius in units of the compton wavelength , respectively .",
    "we get then @xmath101 this equation is solved numerically for @xmath102 as a function of @xmath103 for a given set of @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath51 .",
    "the results are presented in figure 1 .",
    "we plot the first values of @xmath102 up to @xmath104 for three values of @xmath103 .",
    "the energy levels are labeled in standard spectroscopic notation @xmath105 , where @xmath106 denotes the @xmath106th solution for a given set of @xmath69 and @xmath54 .",
    "for @xmath107 the non - relativistic results , using the notation @xmath108 , are also presented .",
    "the non - relativistic spectrum is obtained by solving the schrdinger equation for a particle of mass @xmath3 in an infinite spherical potential well of radius @xmath109 .",
    "the solutions can be found , for instance , in the quantum mechanics textbook of landau @xcite ( in this case , there is no spin - orbit coupling of the type because the potential is zero inside the well ) .",
    "the radial functions are spherical bessel functions subject to the boundary condition @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the kinetic energy of the particle .",
    "notice that , in the non - relativistic limit , @xmath112 , equation reduces to since @xmath113 and the factor @xmath114 goes to zero in this limit .    analyzing figure 1",
    ", we see that , as the radius of the well increases , the energy levels with the same @xmath69 start grouping until they become degenerate and almost identical to the corresponding non - relativistic values .",
    "this effect is more pronounced for the states with higher @xmath69 ( notice the behaviour of the @xmath115 and @xmath116 states ) .",
    "so we can conclude that going from a radius @xmath117 to a radius @xmath109 the @xmath8 coupling effect fades away and @xmath54 is no longer needed to classify the eigenstates of the system , and instead the orbital momentum quantum number @xmath69 emerges as the relevant quantum number . since the boundary condition effectively imposes a ( maximum ) value for the wavelength of the wave function and thereby a ( minimum ) value for the energy through the de broglie relation , increasing the radius of the well amounts to decreasing the energy until we reach non - relativistic values for @xmath109 .",
    "notice that for the higher levels , for this value of @xmath118 , even though there is not a perfect match with the non - relativistic energy values , the vanishing of the @xmath8 coupling is a fact .",
    "the crucial scale here is the compton wavelength @xmath99 , determining the relativistic nature of the solution through the well radius .",
    "in summary , we have showed numerically the relativistic nature of the @xmath8 coupling in the dirac equation by computing its solutions for a particle with mass @xmath3 in an infinite spherical potential well of radius @xmath118 and making @xmath118 sufficiently big as to produce non - relativistic solutions .",
