    "the phenomenon of entanglement is ubiquitous in systems of long flexible ropes and , once formed , it often has crucial consequences on the subsequent operations , as we know from our daily experience  @xcite",
    ". it also has a fundamental importance in molecular systems , dictating the dynamics and rheology of dense linear polymer solutions of high molecular weight  @xcite .",
    "entanglement originates , in any case , from the topological constraints imposed by the non - crossability of the chain . in the history of polymer science ,",
    "predicting the macroscopic viscoelasticity of the entangled polymer solution from the molecular theory has been one of the major goals .",
    "our current understanding on this issue owes to the introduction of the following two theoretical models .",
    "the tube model , originally proposed in the theory of rubber elasticity , assumes that the topological constraint imposed by the non - crossability of the chain effectively confines each chain inside a tube - like region , thereby reducing the original many - chain problem to single - chain problem in the  mean - field \"  @xcite .",
    "the reptation model then describes the overall motion of the chain under the temporal topological constraint along the primitive path , where the presence of the chain end is essential for the disengaging from the original tube and the subsequent tube renewal  @xcite .    in this context",
    ", an interesting question arises in the system of ring polymers , also called circular or cyclic polymers  @xcite . here , by definition ,",
    "there are no chain ends , and the topology of the system is frozen at the stage of the sample synthesis , the consequence of which is pronounced even for static properties . to emphasize the point ,",
    "let us recall the basic static properties of linear polymers  @xcite .",
    "in dilute solutions , their conformation can be characterized as a self - avoiding walk with the overall chain dimension @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the segment size and @xmath2 is the number of segments per chain . unless otherwise specified , we are concerned with the good solvent condition in three - dimensional space and adopt for simplicity the mean - field value of the critical exponent @xmath3 , where the swelling as against the ideal chain @xmath4 is due to the excluded - volume interactions among segments . increasing the volume fraction @xmath5 of the segment ,",
    "one reaches the point @xmath6 above which different polymers start to overlap in space . in this so - called semidilute regime ,",
    "the excluded - volume interactions are screened at the scale of the correlation length @xmath7 , and the chain conformation can be envisioned as a random walk of the correlation blob of the size @xmath8 with @xmath9 segments inside , so that the overall size is given by @xmath10 . in the melt , which is a dense limit of the semidilute solution @xmath11 ,",
    "the excluded - volume interactions are screened at the segment scale , so the chain follows the almost ideal random walk statistics .",
    "turning our attention to the melt of ring polymers , the excluded - volume interactions would be screened as well , but for this very reason , the topological constraints , which may be buried under the excluded - volume effect in other situations , stand out .",
    "therefore , unlike the linear polymer case , we encounter increased complexity instead of simplification due to the screening of the excluded - volume effect .",
    "indeed , it has been acknowledged in recent years that understanding conformations and dynamics of the melts of noncatenated ring polymers is one of the remaining challenges in the polymer science  @xcite . towards this ambitious goal ,",
    "the construction of a phenomenological theory would offer promising prospects , in which the topological constraints could be accounted through the geometrical picture , just as in the tube model and the reptation model in the theory of linear polymer melts .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to provide a detailed account of the recently proposed such an attempt for the statistics of ring polymer melts  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_mean_field ] , we start with some preliminary remarks on the topological length scale , and then introduce a mean - field model .",

    ". we shall also look into previous conjectures in light of the present theory .",
    "finally , we close in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] with summary and perspectives .",
    "entanglements formed in linear polymer melts and topological constraints in ring polymer melts differ in their nature , but they share some similarities which may trace back to the fact that both arise from the non - crossability constraint in flexible polymer systems .    it is well known that in melts of short linear polymers @xmath12 , there are no signs of entanglement , and their dynamics is well described by the rouse model  @xcite .",
    "the entanglement length @xmath13 depends on the chain stiffness , concentration , etc . , but its typical value in melts of flexible polymer is on the order of @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "there is a quantity similar to @xmath13 for the ring polymer melts , which we call the _ intrinsic topological length _ and denote by @xmath15 in the following .",
    "it has been observed in numerical simulations that in melts of short ring polymers @xmath16 , there seems to be no sign of the topological constraints , and each ring obeys the ideal statistics with the size @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "there are some good evidence that the numerical value of @xmath15 is comparable to that of @xmath13 in the corresponding linear chain melts  @xcite .",
    "we provide a geometrical interpretation of @xmath15 in sec .",
    "[ large_scale ] .    in linear polymer melts with @xmath18 , chains are mutually entangled , where the tube size is given by @xmath19 .",
    "the tube size and , therefore , @xmath13 as well are independent of @xmath2 for @xmath20 , which are important quantities in the rheological characterization of the system .",
    "however , the analogy may break down for ring polymer melts with @xmath21 due to the non - trivial ring conformation in large scale in contrast to the ideal conformation in linear polymers . since there is no reason",
    "_ a priori _ to claim the constant topological length , we let it be @xmath2 dependent and denote it by @xmath22 with the  initial condition \" @xmath23",
    ". the functional form of @xmath24 and the conformation of individual rings at large scale @xmath25^{1/2}$ ] for melts of high molecular weight rings @xmath26 should be determined from the topological constraints in the system .",
    "this can be done self - consistently by the following mean - field theory .",
    "we are concerned with the topological effects in melts of noncatenated , unknotted rings .",
    "all other effects are irrelevant , which leads to the ideal behaviors in melts of linear polymers / phantom ring polymers .",
    "two contributions could be identified .",
    "one is the inter - molecular ( avoiding to link with other rings ) , and the other is the intra - molecular ( avoiding the self - knotting ) . to write down the free energy for these effects , we recall the observation that two unlinked ring polymers with zero thickness , i.e. , no excluded- volume , repel each other at close distances  @xcite .",
    "the second virial coefficient of interaction between such rings is found to be of the order of the size of the ring cubed .",
    "that is to say , in dilute solutions , the topological effect restricting the phase space volume can be effectively treated as the excluded - volume problem .",
    "there is also a conjecture based on the analysis of gauss linking number of random flexible rings that the topological constraints in long flexible rings and the excluded - volume interactions have similar effects  @xcite .",
    "we shall seek for a possible way to implement this excluded - volume analogy in the statistics of melts and concentrated solutions .",
    "in what follows , we include the concentration effect by regarding a semidilute solution as a melt composed of the correlation blob of size @xmath7 .",
    "the melt is understood to be the limit @xmath11 .",
    "the equilibrium spatial size @xmath27 ( such as a radius of gyration ) of each ring is a function of @xmath2 and the monomer volume fraction @xmath5 .",
    "let us introduce several quantities relevant for the characterization of ring polymer melts .",
    "the total number of monomers in the region of volume @xmath28 of a single ring is @xmath29 , thus , the number of rings there is @xmath30 for a given ring , @xmath31 can roughly be thought of as the number of neighboring rings , so we call it the _ coordination number _ , which turns out to be an important measure for the geometrical characterization of the melts . equally important",
    "is the _ self - density _ @xmath32 which measures the degree of compactness of individual rings , or the degree of mutual ring interpenetration .",
    "these two quantities are related as @xmath33 .",
    "the effective excluded - volume @xmath34 of the ring with the spatial size @xmath27 scales with volume and we write it as @xmath35 where a dimensionless factor @xmath36 ( independent of @xmath2 ) is introduced to account for the fact that the ring is not a rigid particle .",
    "instead , it is a very soft object , and significant interpenetrations should occur in melts .",
    "of course , this factor @xmath36 can not be arbitrary , and shall be fixed later by the physical requirement associated with the intrinsic topological length @xmath15 mentioned in sec .  [ subsec_topo_length ] .",
    "the  volume fraction \" of topological origin then follows as @xmath37 which plays a role as an order parameter in the theory .",
    "we thus write down the free energy as a function of @xmath38 as @xmath39      evaluating the noncatenation constraint contribution to the free energy is the most difficult part in the problem .",
    "we follow the excluded - volume analogy and make a simple proposal  @xcite . given an effective volume fraction @xmath38 of topological origin , we assume that its impact can be treated within the framework of liquid theory , where the excluded - volume effect in dense solutions has been intensively studied .",
    "we adopt a classical van der waals theory of fluids whose free energy density for one component fluid with the volume fraction @xmath5 and the excluded - volume @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 \\ln{[\\phi/(1-\\phi ) ] } -\\epsilon \\phi^2 $ ] with @xmath42 being thermal energy . in our case , this may be transformed as @xmath43 \\ln{[(1-\\phi_r)]}$ ] where we set @xmath44 ( athermal ) .",
    "the ideal gas term is irrelevant here , since it is already included in the non - topological part of the free energy .",
    "the free energy per ring @xmath45 is thus @xmath46      an inspection of eq .",
    "( [ f_inter ] ) indicates that increasing the ring size @xmath27 is unfavorable due to the noncatenation constraint .",
    "thus , this topology effect leads to the squeezing of the ring toward a globular state , which should be negotiated with the unknotting constraint . to derive the expression for @xmath47 , it is instructive first to recall the free energy cost @xmath48 to confine an isolated linear polymer into a small closed cavity under @xmath49 condition , where @xmath50 .",
    "a standard scaling consideration suggests the following form ; @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the unperturbed coil size and @xmath53 is a linear dimension of the cavity .",
    "the exponent @xmath54 can be determined by examining the system size dependence of @xmath48 under constant segment density ( or constant osmotic pressure ) .",
    "that is to say , we require @xmath55 upon enlarging the system size as @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "this thermodynamic consideration fixes @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "we expect that the probability of self - knotting depends on the self - density @xmath59 , and it linearly increases with the system size @xmath2 under constant @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , the above reasoning for @xmath48 can be directly applied to @xmath60 , too , so we obtain @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the unperturbed polymer size in semidilute regime as already stated in sec .",

    "the above equation can be rewritten as @xmath64 which guarantees the linear dependence on @xmath2 under the fixed order parameter @xmath38 .    to get a physically appealing insight ,",
    "let us again come back to the problem of the confined @xmath65-chain .",
    "its spatial structure can be viewed as a dense piling of blobs of size @xmath66 with @xmath67 segments inside .",
    "this implies the relation @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the free energy cost ( eq .  ( [ f_theta ] ) ) can be obtained by assigning @xmath70 per blob , i.e. , @xmath71  @xcite .    it is tempting to follow the same line in our problem , too , but now the self - density @xmath59 should be used to write down the space - filling condition",
    ". let us do so .",
    "a view of the compact ring of size @xmath72 as a dense piling of topological mesh ( blob ) implies @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",

    "<S> the result captures many of the salient features observed so far , including ( i ) the overall spacial size of rings , ( ii ) the coordinate number , i.e. , the number of rings surrounding a given ring , ( iii ) the topological length scale as a function of the molecular weight and ( iv ) the effect of the chain stiffness and concentration . </S>",
    "<S> we also suggest a geometrical interpretation of the topological length scale , which may shed some light on the entanglement concept in polymeric systems . </S>"
