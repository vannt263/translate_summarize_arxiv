    "electron states in random systems have become an active research topic since the generality of localization phenomena in one dimension ( 1d )  @xcite . although it is well established that almost any nonzero disorder causes exponential localization of all eigenstates in 1d systems , regardless their energy ( see , e.  g. , ref .   and references therein )",
    ", there exist several exceptions .",
    "it is nowadays well known that extended states may arise in random systems where disorder exhibits short - range   or long - range correlations  @xcite .",
    "spatial correlation means that random variables are not independent within a given correlation length .",
    "suppression of localization by correlations was further put forward for the explanation of high conductivity of doped polyaniline  @xcite as well as transport properties of random semiconductor superlattices  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we report further progress along the lines in the preceding paragraph .",
    "we turn ourselves to one of the pioneering works in the field , namely the work of wu and phillips on polyaniline ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "these authors showed that polyaniline can be mapped onto a random dimer model that has a set of extended states , originated by a resonance of a single dimer defect ( two neighbor sites with the same energy ) .",
    "electron states whose energy is close to this resonance turn out to be extended ( in the sense that their localization length is larger than the system size ) when dimers are placed at random in the 1d system . in this work",
    "we show that _ dimers _ are not needed to observe extended states in 1d random systems with short - range correlated disorder . to this end , we built up a simple model of semiconductor binary alloy like ternary iii - v compounds. in these alloys ( say al@xmath0ga@xmath1as ) , the cation sublattice is occupied by the same atoms ( say as ) while anions ( say al and ga ) are randomly distributed over the other sublattice .",
    "we model these alloys by considering a 1d random binary alloy with two species , referred to as a and b atoms hereafter . in order to mimic the disorder present in the anion sublattice",
    ", we further assume that the site energy of a atoms is randomly distributed from site to site while that of b atoms is the same over the entire cation sublattice . as a major point",
    ", we demonstrate the occurrence of extended states in the vicinity of the site energy of b atoms _ in spite of the fact that the system is purely 1d and random_. thus , we conclude that dimers ( or larger defects like trimers or n - mers ) are not required to observe extended states in 1d systems with short - range correlated disorder .",
    "we consider a 1d binary system where a ( b ) atoms are placed at odd ( even ) positions of the otherwise regular lattice , whose corresponding site energies are @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) with @xmath4 , @xmath5 being the number of unit cells of the alloy . the schrdinger equation for stationary eigenstates @xmath6 is @xmath7 where the @xmath8 is the corresponding eigenenergy , @xmath9 is the site energy and @xmath10 is the number of atoms in the system . according to our model , site energy at even positions",
    "is the same and we can set @xmath11 without loss of generality .",
    "the source of disorder in this model arise from the stochastic fluctuations of site energy at even positions .",
    "we assume that @xmath12 is a set of _ uncorrelated _ random gaussian variables with mean value @xmath13 and variance @xmath14 .",
    "hereafter @xmath15 will be referred to as _ degree of disorder_. the joint distribution function of a realization of disorder is represented by the direct product of single gaussians .",
    "thus @xmath16    the schrdinger equation  ( [ h ] ) can be written via the @xmath17 promotion - matrix @xmath18 as follows @xmath19 by iterating this equation we can relate @xmath20 and @xmath21 with @xmath22 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is referred to as the transfer - matrix .",
    "we find most convenient to deal with the promotion - matrix of the ( diatomic ) unit cell instead of that corresponding to a single atom  ( [ promotion ] ) , namely @xmath25 . for real @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the promotion - matrix @xmath26 can be regarded as an element of the @xmath27 group , isomorphic to @xmath28 .",
    "it can be cast in the following form via the pauli matrices @xmath29",
    "@xmath30\\,{\\cal i}_{2 } - { e\\over 2}\\,(e -\\epsilon_{2n-1})\\sigma_3 + { \\frac{\\epsilon_{2n-1}}{2}}\\sigma_1   + i\\left(e-{\\frac{\\epsilon_{2n-1 } } { 2}}\\right ) \\sigma_2 ,    \\label{t2}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 denotes the @xmath32 unit matrix .",
    "it is easy to demonstrate the following useful property @xmath33 .",
    "the transfer - matrix of the entire system ( @xmath5 unit cells ) is obtained as @xmath34 .",
    "oseledec s theorem  @xcite states that the following limiting matrix @xmath35 exists @xmath36 with eigenvalues @xmath37 .",
    "the lyapunov exponent @xmath38 is nothing but the inverse of the localization length @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is given in units of the length of the unit cell .",
    "in order to find the localization length one should calculate the matrix @xmath41 for large @xmath5 . we will perform this task following the technique developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . by using the formula for the decomposition of the product of two spin-1/2 states into the direct sum of scalar and spin-1 states",
    ", we have @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the spin-1 part . multiplying the expression  ( [ tt1 ] ) by the left and right by @xmath44 we have @xmath45",
    "now we should take into account the disorder and calculate the average of @xmath35 by random distribution of @xmath2 at odd sites @xmath46 where @xmath47 is defined by  ( [ l ] ) . according to oseledec s theorem  @xcite , the lyapunov exponent and ,",
    "correspondingly , the localization length will be given by @xmath48 ,   \\label{cl}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the closest to unity eigenvalue of @xmath50 , whose elements are @xmath51    delocalized states have an infinite localization length and , therefore , at some particular energy @xmath8 , the matrix @xmath52 should have an eigenvalue equal to one .",
    "hence we obtain the following condition for obtaining delocalized states @xmath53=-2\\sigma^2e^2 = 0.\\ ] ] as we see , there is a delocalized state at @xmath54 .",
    "one can calculate the localization length  ( [ cl ] ) and expand it around @xmath54 . for @xmath55 one",
    "gets @xmath56 notice that the localization length is asymmetric around the energy of the extended state since it scales as @xmath57 at the left and @xmath58 at the right .",
    "the situation is just the opposite for @xmath59 .",
    "remarkably , the prefactor at the left depends on the degree of disorder of the alloy but becomes independent of disorder at the right .",
    "when the degree of disorder vanishes ( @xmath60 ) , the alloy is simply a diatomic periodic chain with site energies @xmath61 and @xmath13 in each unit cell and , consequently , there are two allowed bands .",
    "the lower band ranges from @xmath62^{1/2}$ ] up to @xmath61 while the upper band ranges from @xmath13 up to @xmath63^{1/2}$ ] for @xmath55 .",
    "obviously all eigenstates are bloch functions and spread over the entire chain .",
    "localization occurs as soon as a small degree of disorder is introduced in the system .",
    "but , according to our previous results , the eigenstate with @xmath54 remains extended .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the inverse of the localization length obtained from  ( [ cl ] ) is plotted against @xmath8 for @xmath64 and different degrees of disorder @xmath15 . in all cases",
    "the inverse of the localization length is nonzero except at @xmath54 , where @xmath65 .",
    "this suggests the occurrence of a delocalized states at @xmath54 .",
    "to confirm the above analytical results we have also numerically diagonalized the schrdinger equation  ( [ h ] ) . we will mainly focus our attention on the normalized density of states @xmath66 and on the degree of localization ( inverse participation ratio , ipr ) for the states at energy @xmath8 .",
    "they are defined respectively as follows  @xcite    @xmath67\\biggr\\rangle ,   \\label{rho}\\ ] ]    @xmath68 \\biggl(\\sum_{n=1}^{{\\cal n } }   a_{kn}^4\\biggr)\\biggr\\rangle ,   \\label{ipr}\\ ] ]    where the angular brackets indicate an average over an ensemble of disordered linear chains and the @xmath69 is the eigenvector of  ( [ h ] ) corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "here @xmath72 is the spectral resolution and @xmath73 is the heaviside step function .",
    "the ipr behaves like @xmath74 for delocalized states spreading uniformly over the entire system on increasing @xmath75 . in particular ,",
    "the ipr can be exactly computed for the eigenstates of the periodic lattices . in doing",
    "so we obtain the expected behavior for @xmath76 . on the contrary ,",
    "localized states exhibit much higher values . in the extreme case ,",
    "when the eigestate is localized at a single site , the ipr becomes unity .",
    "we have fixed @xmath64 and studied several values of the degree of disorder @xmath15 , ranging from @xmath77 up to @xmath78 .",
    "the highest value of the degree of disorder considered in the present work means that the typical fluctuations of the site energy is of the order of the nearest neighbor coupling .",
    "the maximum number of atoms in the chain was @xmath79 ( @xmath80 unit cells ) although larger systems were also studied to check that our main results are independent of the size .",
    "the results comprise the average over @xmath81 realizations of the disorder for each given pair of parameters @xmath13 and @xmath15 .",
    "the spectral resolution was @xmath82 .",
    "let us comment the results we have obtained numerically .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the dos for two different values of the degree of disorder ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) when the system size is @xmath79 and @xmath64 .",
    "the dos presents the usual u - shape within the bands when the degree of disorder is small .",
    "the singularities at the edge of the allowed bands are smeared out on increasing the degree of disorder except at @xmath54 , where the divergence remains even for the largest degree of disorder ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "this result provides further evidence that the states at @xmath54 are delocalized .",
    "the degree of localization ( ipr ) presents an overall increase when the degree of disorder increases , meaning that the larger the degree of disorder , the smaller the localization length .",
    "this is clearly observed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where we show the ipr as a function of the energy for the same parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . however , the increase of the ipr strongly depends on the energy , being more pronounced close to the center of both allowed bands .",
    "interestingly , the ipr at @xmath54 becomes independent on the degree of disorder although depends on the system size , as expected .",
    "this peculiarity manifest the delocalized character of the states at this spectral region . finally , notice the good correspondence between fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( analytical results ) and fig",
    ".  [ fig3 ] ( numerical results ) .",
    "in this paper we have considered electron dynamics in a one - dimensional model of binary alloy where disorder lies in one of the two sublattices .",
    "although the system is purely one - dimensional and random , we have demonstrated analytically the existence of delocalized states close to a resonant energy , which match that of the atoms of the other sublattice .",
    "numerical results from the evaluation of the dos and ipr ( degree of localization ) strongly suggest that there exist many states close to the resonant energy that remain unscattered in finite systems ."
