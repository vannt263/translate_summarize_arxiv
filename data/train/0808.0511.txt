    "though extensively discussed , the physical composition of the grb outflow is not clear yet ( see @xcite for reviews ) . in principle",
    ", the outflows could be either poynting - flux dominated or baryon dominated .",
    "the former is favored if the central engine is a millisecond magnetar @xcite or the outflow is launched from a black hole@xmath6torus system through mhd processes . for a magnetized outflow ,",
    "the prompt @xmath7rays are powered by the magnetic energy dissipation @xcite or magnetized internal shocks @xcite .",
    "a signature is the high linear polarization of the prompt emission @xcite , which was reported @xcite in grb 021206 but afterwards ruled out @xcite . in a few other events ,",
    "high linear polarization has been claimed but independent measurements for each burst are needed to confirm these discoveries .    a  robust \" evidence for the magnetized grb outflow model may be the magnetization of the grb reverse shock ( rs ) . shortly after the discovery of the very bright optical flash of grb 990123 @xcite , sari & piran @xcite and mszros & rees @xcite showed that the @xmath8 decline of the optical flash can be well interpreted by the adiabatically cooling of the rs electrons .",
    "the self - consistent fitting of the very early and the late time afterglow data requires that @xmath9 , the fraction of the shock energy given to the magnetic field , of the rs is much larger than that of the forward shock ( fs ) @xcite .",
    "it is very interesting to note that such a finding has been confirmed in almost all optical flash modelings , such as for grb 021211 @xcite , grb 041219a @xcite , grb 050401 @xcite , grb 050904 @xcite , grb 060111b @xcite , grb 061126 @xcite , and grb 080319b @xcite .",
    "a natural interpretation for this finding is that the grb outflow is magnetized and the magnetic field in the rs region is dominated by the component carried from the central engine .",
    "the magnetized outflow model also helps to solve the puzzle why optical flashes have not been detected in most _ swift _ grbs @xcite .",
    "this is because for a highly magnetized grb outflow , under the ideal mhd limit , the magnetic energy can not be converted into the rs energy effectively .",
    "the emission of a magnetized grb rs has been calculated by fan et al .",
    "@xcite and zhang & kobayashi @xcite ( see also @xcite for the existence of such shocks ) . with reasonable parameters ( @xmath10 ) ,",
    "the resulting rs emission is very bright and is inconsistent with the observational data .",
    "it is the time to revisit these preliminary calculations .",
    "following @xcite , we calculate the emission of magnetized rss .",
    "some important modifications include : ( i ) the arrival time of the rs emission photons has been calculated more accurately ( see the appendix for details ) .",
    "( ii ) the electron energy distribution is calculated by solving the continuity equation with the power - law source function @xmath11 , normalized by a local injection rate @xcite .",
    "( iii ) the cooling of the electrons , due to both synchrotron and inverse compton radiation , has been consideredray flow with the rs region is very tight . in such cases the rs electrons",
    "will be cooled by the prompt @xmath7rays , too . as a result",
    ", the rs optical emission will be dimmer than what we get in this work . ] .",
    "( iv ) the synchrotron self - absorption has also been taken into account .",
    "marked in the figure , other physical parameters are taken as : the duration of the burst @xmath12 s , the initial lorentz factor @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 erg , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 . for the fs , we assume @xmath19 . ]",
    "we find a bright ( rs ) optical flash is absent in the following scenarios :    * _ significant magnetization . _ * after the important corrections mentioned above , we find a @xmath0 is enough to suppress the rs emission effectively and thus be able to explain the absence of the bright optical flashes in most grb afterglows ( see fig.[fig : sigma_wide ] ) .",
    "this renders the magnetization interpretation more attractive because @xmath2 declines with radius after the prompt emission and is expected to be @xmath20 at a radius @xmath21 cm @xcite .    for clarity , in fig.[fig :",
    "sigma_wide ] we plot the fs emission for @xmath22 while the rs emission is presented for @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath24 values are assumed to be the same for both rs and fs .",
    "the new results are significantly different from those obtained in @xcite .",
    "* _ mild magnetization but a very soft spectrum of the rs emission .",
    "_ * in all previous calculations , the energy distribution index , @xmath25 , of the rs electrons is taken to be the same as that of the fs electrons . but this treatment may be well wrong .",
    "we know that usually @xmath25 is relevant to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the velocities ( in units of the speed of light @xmath29 and measured in the rest frame of the shock front ) for the upstream and the downstream regions , respectively . for a relativistic un - magnetized shock",
    ", we have @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "however , for a relativistic magnetized shock , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 @xcite . for @xmath35 , @xmath36 , _ the energy distribution of the rs electrons may be much steeper than in the case of @xmath37_.ray emission with a very soft spectrum might be powered by the magnetized internal shocks and should be linearly polarized .",
    "] there are two indication evidences for this speculation : ( i ) in a numerical calculation , morlino et al .",
    "@xcite found a @xmath38 for @xmath39 , and ( ii ) in the 2.5d ion - electron shock simulation , the acceleration of particles in the case of @xmath40 is much more efficient than in the case of @xmath41 @xcite .    assuming that the rs electrons have a @xmath42 , the rs optical emission will be weakened by a factor of @xmath43 as long as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 hz is the observer s frequency and @xmath46 is the typical synchrotron radiation frequency of the rs electrons .",
    "for @xmath47 and @xmath48 , we have @xmath49",
    ". such a correction will render the rs optical emission for @xmath50 , as shown in fig.[fig : sigma_wide ] , outshone by the fs emission . as a result , a bright rs optical flash is absent .    .",
    "the solid and the dotted lines are the rs emission component .",
    "the dashed and the dash - dotted lines are the fs emission",
    ". all parameters , except @xmath51 s and @xmath52 erg , are the same as those in fig.[fig : sigma_wide ] . ]    * _ non - magnetization but a very weak rs .",
    "_ * nakar & piran @xcite and jin & fan @xcite also got very weak rs optical emission in the case of @xmath37 . here",
    "we investigate the influence of the strength of the rs on the peak optical emission in such a particular case .",
    "the numerical results have been presented in fig.[fig : sigma_zero ] .",
    "as expected , the stronger the rs , the brighter the optical emission .",
    "the very weak rs emission implied by the _ swift _ uvot observation strongly suggests a sub - relativistic rs provided that @xmath37 .",
    "in the very early afterglow phase ( during which both the rs and fs exist ) , the magnetic energy of the outflow can not be converted into the kinetic energy of the fs effectively .",
    "after the ceasing of the rs , a significant energy transfer between the magnetized outflow and the fs is possible . in about half of",
    "_ swift _ grb x - ray afterglows , a long term flattening is evident .",
    "this phenomenon motivates an idea that the magnetic energy has been transferred into the kinetic energy of the fs continually but slowly and then gives rise to a shallow x - ray decline phase @xcite . if correct , the magnetized outflow model will be strongly favored because it can also naturally account for the absence of the bright optical flashes in most _ swift _ grbs ( see the previous section ) .",
    "it is thus highly needed to calculate the transfer timescale of the magnetic energy .    ) as a function of the observer s time .",
    "one can see that at an observer s time @xmath53 s , most magnetic energy has been converted into the kinetic energy of the fs . ]    a preliminary investigation has been carried out by fan & piran in @xcite ( see  3.5 therein ) .",
    "the basic idea is that : for a highly magnetized outflow , the magnetic energy can not be converted to the kinetic energy of the ejecta in a single passage of the reverse shock .",
    "there is a possibility to form multiple rss as long as the total pressure behind the contact discontinuity is lower than the thermal pressure of the shocked medium . if the total pressure behind the contact discontinuity gets higher , the rs ceases and the magnetic pressure works upon the shocked medium and leads to the increase of the fs s energy .",
    "the deceleration of the fs is thus suppressed and the afterglow light curves are flattened .",
    "the energy transfer timescale , however , seems to be too short ( see fig.[fig : transfer1 ] for illustration ) to account for the shallow decline phase lasting @xmath54 sec that is detected in many _",
    "swift _ x - ray afterglows .",
    "the very recent numerical simulations confirm our conclusions @xcite .",
    "in this work , we find that :    * the magnetization of the grb outflows plays a crucial role in suppressing the reverse shock optical emission .",
    "bright optical flashes are only expected in the case of @xmath55 .",
    "polarimetry of the optical flashes should have significant detections . *",
    "the energy transfer between a highly magnetized ejecta and the forward shock may be too quick to account for the shallow decline phase that is detected in a good fraction of _ swift _ grb x - ray afterglows .",
