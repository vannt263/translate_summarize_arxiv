    "manifold and knot invariants can be built on the basis of some kind of geometrization of triangulation simplexes .",
    "the method for their construction , in its current state , looks as follows : an acyclic complex of vector spaces and their linear mappings is built , where the vector spaces consist of differentials of geometric quantities ascribed to elements of triangulation , such as euclidean lengths of edges . then the _ torsion _ of this complex is studied .",
    "miraculously , it turns out that it behaves in a beautiful way under _ pachner moves _  elementary rebuildings of a triangulation of a given manifold .    different versions of this construction have been carried out , in full or in part , for three - dimensional ( see references below in this paragraph ) and four - dimensional  @xcite manifolds .",
    "there is very little doubt that it will work for manifolds of greater dimensions as well .",
    "returning to three - dimensional manifolds , the most straightforward geometrization for their triangulations seems to be one using euclidean three - dimensional geometry . such construction",
    "( although without explicit mentioning of acyclic complexes ) was proposed in paper  @xcite , and further development _ for three - dimensional manifolds _ went along the following lines :    * modification of the construction making use of nontrivial representations of the manifold s fundamental group or knot group  @xcite , * modification for _ framed _ knots in manifolds , not using the mentioned nontrivial representations  @xcite , * modification using _ spherical _ ( but still three - dimensional ) geometry instead of euclidean  @xcite , * construction of a _ state - sum model _ using euclidean geometry  @xcite , * the use ( somewhat paradoxical ) of _ two - dimensional _ affine area - preserving geometry  @xcite instead of euclidean three - dimensional ( the manifold , however , remains three - dimensional ! ) .",
    "when working on this subject , we always have in mind our main goal  construction of _ quantum _ invariants in _",
    "greater _ dimensions .",
    "we even hope that efficient constructions will be developed which will find applications in mathematical physics as well .",
    "one way for constructing quantum invariants , formulated in paper  @xcite , was suggested by the following way of quantizing _ integrable models in mathematical physics _ : @xmath0    in this paper we , limiting ourselves , for the time being , to three - dimensional manifolds , make a step on the way to _",
    "multicomponentness_. this step looks modest : instead of three - dimensional , we are using _ four - dimensional _ euclidean geometry .",
    "the idea is , however , clear : to pass on , in future , from three - dimensional manifolds to manifolds of any dimensions , and from four - dimensional geometry  to some very high - dimensional geometry , from which , we hope , we will be able to fish out something _ quantum _ by means of a proper reduction .",
    "let @xmath1 be a pseudotriangulated , compact , connected , orientable three - dimensional manifold .",
    "_ pseudo_triangulations differ from tringulations in the proper sense , or combinatorial triangulations , in that in a pseudotriangulation , the boundary of a simplex may contain a simplex of a smaller dimension several times , and a simplex is _ not _ , in general , determined uniquely by the set of its vertices .",
    "pseudotriangulations contain in many cases a smaller number of elements ( vertices , egdes , two - dimensional faces and tetrahedra ) than combinatorial triangulations , and so are more convenient for calculations .",
    "nevertheless , we impose one restriction on our pseudotriangulations : we require that , for any tetrahedron , _ all four _ its vertices must be _",
    "different_. when we consider sequences of simplicial moves ( local rebuildings ) of a pseudotriangulation , this requirement must be obeyed at every step .    in this paper",
    ", we also require that @xmath1 must be _ without a boundary _ , although we plan to apply our constructions to manifolds with boundaries in forthcoming papers .",
    "we also fix once and for all an orientation of  @xmath1 . in terms of a pseudotriangulation",
    ", this means that every tetrahedron becomes oriented , that is , an ordering of its vertices up to an _ even _ permutation is given , and the orientations of different tetrahedra are _ consistent _ : for instance , two adjacent tetrahedra @xmath2 and @xmath3 have consistent orientations . if the contrary is not stated explicitly , below we consider all tetrahedra only with their `` right '' orientation .",
    "we geometrize our pseudotriangulation in the following way : we ascribe to its every vertex four euclidean coordinates .",
    "the coordinates of a vertex  @xmath4 will be denoted @xmath5 .",
    "these coordinates are arbitrary with the only restriction : no five different vertices can fall into the same affine hyperlane in  @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , if our pseudotriangulation is a triangulation in the proper sense , we get thus a _ piecewise - linear imbedding _ of  @xmath1 into  @xmath6 , i.e. , a locally one - to - one piecewise - linear mapping .",
    "the space  @xmath6 will be understood as having a fixed orientation given by the order of its axes @xmath7 , and  @xmath8 ; we call this orientation _ positive_.    given the coordinates of vertices , we get in a natural way other geometric values for the elements of pseudotriangulation , such as volumes of simplices of different dimensions and different sorts of euclidean angles .",
    "we introduce some notations for them .",
    "the length of an edge  @xmath9 will be denoted  @xmath10 .",
    "the area of a two - dimensional face @xmath11 will be denoted  @xmath12 .",
    "the volume of a tetrahedron @xmath3 will be denoted  @xmath13 .",
    "all these values are supposed to be _",
    "positive_. in contrast with this , when we need a _ four_-volume @xmath14 of a 4-simplex with vertices @xmath15 , this will be the _ oriented _ volume : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , etc .",
    "next we introduce two sorts of angles .",
    "first , these are _ inner _ dihedral angles in a tetrahedron ; we denote them @xmath18 , maybe with subscripts whose meaning is specified when necessary .",
    "the angles  @xmath18 are supposed to take values in the interval @xmath19 .",
    "second , we will need angles between _ adjoint tetrahedra _",
    ", defined as follows .",
    "let there be two tetrahedra @xmath2 and  @xmath3 having the common face  @xmath11 . by definition ,",
    "the angle  @xmath20 between them is the _ exterior _ dihedral angle at the two - face @xmath11 in the four - simplex @xmath21 , which is , moreover , taken with the minus sign in case if @xmath22 .",
    "note that @xmath23 because this change of the orientation of face  @xmath11 implies also the change of order in which the oriented tetrahedra @xmath2 and @xmath3 come .",
    "three - component deficit angles are a key notion in this paper .",
    "let there be an edge  @xmath24 in the pseudotriangulation of  @xmath1 , and let its link consist of edges @xmath25 in such way that tetrahedra @xmath26 have the right orientation .",
    "these tetrahedra form together the _ star _ of  @xmath24 .",
    "now we geometrize this star in a way slightly different from subsection  [ ss_geom ] .",
    "we begin with ascribing lengths to all edges in the star in such way that @xmath27 become euclidean tetrahedra .",
    "then we ascribe some real numbers @xmath28 , defined modulo @xmath29 , to the respective faces @xmath30 .",
    "_ after _ this , we start trying to put this structure in  @xmath6 in the following way .",
    "first , we put in  @xmath6 the tetrahedron @xmath31 , i.e. , give euclidean coordinates @xmath32 to its vertices in such way that distances between vertices coincide with the given lengths of edges .",
    "we can say that we _ associate a coordinate system _ with tetrahedron  @xmath31 .",
    "then , given the number  @xmath33 , we can give euclidean coordinates to vertex  @xmath34 , in a unique way provided we want to obtain again the right edge lengths and @xmath33 as the angle between tetrahedra @xmath31 and @xmath35 in the sense of subsection  [ ss_geom ] .",
    "we can say that we _ extend the coordinate system _ to tetrahedron  @xmath35 . continuing this way and making one full revolution around  @xmath24",
    ", we get as a result a _ new _ coordinate system for  @xmath31 , with new axes @xmath36 .",
    "the transition from old to new coordinate system defines an element of the group of euclidean motions of  @xmath6 .",
    "however , as old and new coordinates obviously coincide for vertices @xmath37 and  @xmath38 , we actually get a rotation within the space orthogonal to  @xmath24 , i.e. , an element of group  @xmath39 , which we denote as  @xmath40 and call _ three - component deficit angle _ , or _ dicrete curvature _",
    ", around  @xmath24 .",
    "the case @xmath41 corresponds exactly to the situation where the whole star of  @xmath24 can be put in  @xmath6 without `` cracks '' .",
    "we do not specify here how we represent the values @xmath42 in matrix form .",
    "this is because we will mostly need their _ infinitesimal _ versions @xmath43 , for @xmath42 infinitely close to unity , and we will explain in subsection  [ ss_seq ] how we represent infinitesimal quantities .",
    "we will now construct our `` main '' algebraic complex , consisting of based linear spaces of differentials of geometric values and linear mappings between them .",
    "the word `` based '' means that a vector space is taken together with some basis in it chosen in some natural way .",
    "this means that elements of the vector space can be represented as _",
    "column vectors _ , and linear mappings as",
    "_ matrices_.",
    "we call our complex `` main '' because , besides studying it as it is , we will also be interested in its various modifications .",
    "it is expected that this complex and/or its modifications are _ acyclic _ in many interesting cases ; although we do not prove general theorems about acyclicity in this paper , we will show it at least on examples in the next paper(s ) in this series .",
    "for an acyclic complex , one can calculate its _ torsion _ , and we show in section  [ s_moves ] how to obtain a topological invariant from this .",
    "consider the following sequence of vector spaces and linear mappings .",
    "we first just write it out , and then we explain in this subsection the used notations and give the definitions for both spaces and mappings . the proof that our sequence is actually an algebraic complex is given in subsection  [ ss_c ] .",
    "so , our sequence is : @xmath44    we assume that vertices of the pseudotriangulation of  @xmath1 have been put in  @xmath6 as described in subsection  [ ss_geom ] .",
    "the vector space  @xmath45 is the lie algebra of infinitesimal euclidean motions of  @xmath6 .",
    "the vector space denoted  @xmath46 consists of column vectors of differentials @xmath47 of all coordinates for all vertices  @xmath4 in the pseudotriangulation .",
    "the definition of mapping  @xmath48 is obvious : it reflects how an infinitesimal motion of  @xmath6 changes the coordinates @xmath49 of all points  @xmath4 .",
    "explicitly , we will write it as follows .",
    "we identify algebra  @xmath45 with the vector space of columns @xmath50 the superscript @xmath51 standing for matrix transposing .",
    "vector  ( [ e4 ] ) gives , by definition , the following differentials of coordinates of a given vertex  @xmath4 due to mapping  @xmath48 : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the _ antisymmetric _ matrix with elements  @xmath54 .",
    "so , the vector  @xmath55 represents a translation , while @xmath53 is an element of lie algebra  @xmath56 .",
    "the third vector space , @xmath57 , is a direct sum of the space  @xmath58 consisting of differentials of all edge lengths in the pseudotriangulation , and the space  @xmath59 consisting of differentials of values  @xmath60 ( see subsection  [ ss_geom ] ) for all two - dimensional faces .",
    "the definition of mapping  @xmath61 is again obvious : if the coordinates of all vertices are given , they determine naturally all @xmath62 and  @xmath60 .",
    "mapping  @xmath61 is the infinitesimal version of this correspondence .",
    "we have thus described @xmath61 geometrically , without giving explicit formulas like  ( [ acal ] ) .",
    "we will also give in this section only a geometric description of mapping  @xmath63 .",
    "nevertheless , we will provide explicit formulas when we need them in our calculations in section  [ s_moves ] .",
    "the fourth vector space , denoted @xmath64 , consists of infinitesimal three - component deficit angles for all edges in the pseudotriangulation .",
    "an infinitesimal three - component deficit angle  @xmath65 is by definition an infinitesimal rotation around the edge  @xmath24 , thus represented by an antisymmetric @xmath66 matrix  @xmath67 with the property @xmath68 .",
    "we require that @xmath69 this antisymmetry reflects the fact that the direction in which we go around @xmath24 is determined by the direction of  @xmath24 according to the corkscrew rule , and is in agreement with the definition of mapping  @xmath63 which we will give soon .",
    "on the other hand , we want to think of the space @xmath64 as consisting of column vectors of dimension  @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the number of edges in the pseudotriangulation .",
    "to each edge belong three components , which we define in the following way .",
    "choose some positively oriented euclidean coordinate system with axes @xmath72 in such way that axis  @xmath73 goes in the direction of vector  @xmath74 .",
    "in this coordinate system , @xmath67 is transformed to a matrix with elements  @xmath75 such that @xmath76 .",
    "and the three elements @xmath77 are by definition the three mentioned components of the column vector .",
    "the mapping  @xmath63 shows which deficit angles result from given deformations of lengths  @xmath62 and angles  @xmath60 and goes as follows .",
    "imagine that initially all lengths  @xmath62 and angles  @xmath60 come from some vertex coordinates due to usual euclidean formulae .",
    "if we then change @xmath62 s and @xmath60 s slightly but otherwise arbitrarily , the whole structure can no longer be placed in  @xmath6 .",
    "still , we can define deficit angles as in subsection  [ ss_da ] . if now the changes of @xmath62 s and @xmath60 s are _ infinitesimal _ , we get infinitesimal three - component deficit angles  @xmath43 which are nothing but infinitesimal rotations around corresponding edges .",
    "it is not hard to see that matrices representing these rotations _ do not depend _ on the tetrahedron from which we start to drag a coordinate system around an edge ( in subsection  [ ss_da ] , the edge was called  @xmath24 , and the tetrahedron @xmath31 ) .",
    "so , mapping  @xmath63 by definition provides exactly this way of obtaining @xmath43 s from @xmath78 s and  @xmath79 s .",
    "the fifth vector space , denoted @xmath80 , consists of antisymmetric @xmath66 matrices @xmath81 corresponding to every vertex  @xmath4 . to represent @xmath81 as a column vector , we act again in the same way as for matrix  @xmath53 in  ( [ acal ] ) .",
    "the mapping  @xmath82 gives , by definition , the following  @xmath81 from given  @xmath43 s : @xmath83 where the sum is taken over all vertices  @xmath37 joined to  @xmath4 by edges . in ( [ rho ] ) , both @xmath81 and @xmath84 are considered , of course , as @xmath66 matrices  elements of the same algebra  @xmath56 .",
    "the last , sixth vector space , denoted @xmath85 , is ten - dimensional , like the first space  @xmath45 . here",
    "@xmath86 is _ one _ matrix  element of  @xmath56 , and @xmath87 is one four - dimensional vector . by definition ,",
    "mapping  @xmath88 makes the following @xmath86 and  @xmath87 from given  @xmath81 : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the radius vector of vertex  @xmath4 , and @xmath91 is the result of the action of the linear operator  @xmath81 on this vector .",
    "the sums in  ( [ alpha - beta ] ) are taken over all vertices  @xmath4 in the pseudotriangulation .",
    "[ th_c ] sequence ( [ mc ] ) is an algebraic complex , i.e. , all the compositions of neighboring linear operators @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are zero operators .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ th_c ] follows from simple geometric considerations .",
    "\\(a ) @xmath96 is just a differential version of the fact that euclidean motions do not change lengths and angles .",
    "\\(b ) @xmath97 is a differential version of the fact that , if lengths and angles for our pseudotriangulation are found from given coordinates of vertices , then there are no deficit angles ( i.e. , all @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) .",
    "\\(c ) @xmath100 can be obtained as follows .",
    "let the edges going out of a vertex  @xmath4 be @xmath101 .",
    "suppose our geometrization is now made in the sense of subsection  [ ss_da ] : edge lengths  @xmath62 and angles  @xmath60 between adjacent tetrahedra are given , but no vertex coordinates .",
    "when we go around edge  @xmath102 in manifold  @xmath1 in the same way as we did it for edge  @xmath24 in subsection  [ ss_da ] , we get a rotation of a euclidean coordinate system associated with the tetrahedron from which we have started .",
    "likewise , we get such a rotation if we go along some closed trajectory starting within a fixed tetrahedron @xmath103 and going always through tetrahedra belonging to the star of vertex  @xmath4 , with the condition that this trajectory is allowed to intersect two - dimensional faces but not edges .",
    "it is obvious that if one such trajectory can be continuously deformed into another in such way that it never intersects any edge , the resulting rotation  element of group  @xmath104  will be the same for both trajectories .",
    "consider now the infinitesimal version of this situation , where all rotations are infinitely close to unity , differing from it by some elements @xmath105 .",
    "first , it is not hard to see that if we go from a given tetrahedron @xmath103 along a trajectory surrounding just _",
    "one _ edge  @xmath102 , where @xmath106 does not need to coincide with any of @xmath107 , then the corresponding @xmath108 does _ not _ depend on the exact way used to reach  @xmath102 and go back .",
    "second , if a trajectory surrounds several edges , then @xmath43 is just a sum of corresponding  @xmath109 .",
    "third , given that the link of  @xmath4 is a sphere , the trajectory surrounding _ all _ edges is the same as the trajectory surrounding _ no _ edges .",
    "this means exactly that the r.h.s .  of  ( [ rho ] )",
    "vanishes if the @xmath43 s come from some @xmath78 s and  @xmath79 s .",
    "\\(d ) @xmath110 .",
    "first , each @xmath43 , for instance , @xmath84 , yields due to  @xmath82 mutually opposite values  @xmath111 on two ends of the edge : @xmath112 see ( [ cb ] ) and ( [ rho ] ) .",
    "now it is clear that the first equation  ( [ alpha - beta ] ) gives zero if the @xmath111 come from _ any _  @xmath43 .",
    "second , considering in the same way only one nonzero @xmath113 , we get from the second equation  ( [ alpha - beta ] ) @xmath114 because a rotation around edge  @xmath9 leaves this edge intact .",
    "a very good introduction in triangulated manifolds and pachner moves is paper  @xcite .",
    "although it deals with combinatorial triangulations , it is just a small exercise to extend its results onto our situation with pseudotriangulated manifolds subject to conditions stated in the beginning of subsection  [ ss_geom ] .",
    "what matters for us is that any ( pseudo)triangulation of our manifold  @xmath1 can be transformed into any other ( pseudo)triangulation by a finite sequence of pachner moves , which are in three dimensions moves @xmath117 and @xmath118 , explained in subsections [ ss_2 - 3 ] and  [ ss_1 - 4 ] respectively , and the inverses of these moves .",
    "thus , a quantity invariant under all pachner moves is an invariant of a piecewise - linear manifold . given the well - known fact that , in three dimensions , the categories of piecewise - linear , topological and differentiable manifolds essentially coincide , our invariant will be an invariant of a topological or differentiable manifold as well .",
    "we will build an invariant of pachner moves on the base of the torsion of complex  ( [ mc ] ) _ assuming its acyclicity_. acyclicity , or exactness , for a chain complex like  ( [ mc ] ) means that the image of any homomorphism ( in our case  linear mapping of vector spaces ) coincides exactly with the kernel of the next homomorphism : @xmath119 for an acyclic complex  ( [ mc ] ) , we define its _ torsion _ as @xmath120 where we take for each matrix @xmath121 a nonzero minor of the maximal order .",
    "further conditions are : the basis of each of six vector spaces in  ( [ mc ] ) must be completely divided between the two minors of matrices standing to the left and to the right of this vector space . for example , if the rows of @xmath122 correspond to some chosen basis vectors in space  @xmath64 , then the columns of @xmath123 must correspond to exactly all the rest of basis vectors in  @xmath64 .    in terms of the textbook  @xcite , we are using the definition of torsion based on the notion of a _ non - degenerate @xmath124-chain _ which consists , in our case , of submatrices of matrices @xmath121 corresponding to the mentioned minors . as is known , such torsion  @xmath124 does not depend on the specific choice of minors , except for its sign which changes under an odd permutation of basis vectors in any space .",
    "below , we always consider torsion  @xmath124 , determinants related to it and equalities contatining them _ up to a sign_.    it is also of use to have in mind the ( equivalent ) definition of torsion given in section  1 of book  @xcite .",
    "we do not give it here , but the essential point for us is that it is obvious from this definition how to justify the orthogonal rotations of coordinate axes which we will freely use below in our proofs of theorems [ th_2 - 3 ] and  [ th_1 - 4 ] .",
    "the interested reader will see this from the formula given in remark  1 in subsection  1.4 of  @xcite and the fact that the determinant of an orthogonal rotation is unity .",
    "so , below we always assume that complex  ( [ mc ] ) is acyclic .",
    "this convention needs to be made more precise in the following way . to construct a manifold invariant",
    ", we are going to investigate how @xmath124 changes under pachner moves @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath124 is multiplied by some ` local ' ( belonging to the clusters of tetrahedra which undergo a transformation ) factors under moves @xmath117 and @xmath118 ; then under the reverse moves @xmath124 is , of course , divided by the same factors .",
    "it is clear from the very fact that the mentioned ` local ' factors are correctly defined and are neither zero nor infinity that , if the complex is acyclic before a move @xmath117 or @xmath118 , then it is so after the move , and vice versa . to make this statement completely accurate",
    ", one can use lemma  2.5 from book  @xcite , stating that `` a chain complex over a field is acyclic if and only if it has a non - degenerate @xmath124-chain '' .",
    "it will be clear from the proofs of our theorems [ th_2 - 3 ] and  [ th_1 - 4 ] how to choose submatrices for a non - degenerate @xmath124-chain for a complex resulting from a pachner move .      under a move @xmath117 , two adjacent tetrahedra @xmath3 and @xmath2",
    "are replaced with three tetrahedra @xmath125 , @xmath126 and  @xmath127 , see figure  [ fig1 ] .    ]",
    "thus , the changes do not affect the _ vertices _ ( 0-cells ) of the simlicial complex and vector spaces @xmath46 and  @xmath80 corresponding to them .",
    "there is one additional edge ( 1-cell ) @xmath128 in the right - hand - side diagram of figure  [ fig1 ] , compared to the left - hand - side diagram .",
    "consequently , the space  @xmath58 will acquire one additional basis vector  @xmath129 , and the space  @xmath64 will acquire three basis vectors  components of  @xmath130 . to emphasize the three - component character of this differential , we write below @xmath131 instead of  @xmath130 and , generally , @xmath132 instead of  @xmath109 , where @xmath133 is an edge .",
    "changes in two - dimensional faces imply that basis vector  @xmath134 is excluded from the space  @xmath59 , while three new vectors @xmath135 , @xmath136 and  @xmath137 are added to it .",
    "[ th_2 - 3 ] under the move @xmath117 depicted in figure  [ fig1 ] , torsion  @xmath124 of complex  ( [ mc ] ) is multiplied by @xmath138    first we will need the following simple lemma .",
    "[ l * ] the ` initial ' minors in formula ( [ tau ] ) , i.e. , those corresponding to the situation _ before _ move @xmath117 , can always be chosen in such way that @xmath122 contains the column corresponding to  @xmath134 .",
    "consider the tetrahedra in the star of edge  @xmath9 .",
    "if they all lie in  @xmath6 , then @xmath20 is a function of the rest of @xmath139 and the lengths of edges in these tetrahedra .",
    "hence , the row @xmath140 of matrix  @xmath61 ( i.e. , the row corresponding to  @xmath134 ) is a linear combination of its other rows .",
    "this means that a nonvanishing minor of  @xmath61 containing this row can always be replaced with a nonvanishing minor of the same size _ not _ containing it .",
    "consequently , basis vector @xmath134 can be ascribed to @xmath122 .",
    "this will of course cause no trouble to @xmath141 because , due to the acyclicity in term  @xmath57 , this minor will just change in such way that ratio @xmath142 remains the same .",
    "now we continue the proof of theorem  [ th_2 - 3 ] .",
    "let the initial @xmath122 be as in lemma  [ l * ] .",
    "_ after _ the move @xmath117 , we take a new @xmath122 which contains the column  @xmath129 instead of the column  @xmath134 in the old minor , as well as three new columns @xmath143 and three new rows for components of  @xmath131 .",
    "so , the minors of @xmath144 and  @xmath88 remain the same , and all the change of @xmath124 is concentrated in @xmath122 .",
    "we examine how the ` new ' matrix @xmath63 , i.e. , matrix corresponding to the right - hand - side diagram of figure  [ fig1 ] , is obtained from the ` old ' matrix . as we remember , matrix  @xmath63 consists of partial derivatives of components of quantities  @xmath145 with respect to lengths  @xmath146 and angles  @xmath147 ( @xmath133 and @xmath148 being an edge and a two - face , respectively ) . at this moment",
    ", we will have to consider @xmath145 , for the ` new ' simplicial complex , as functions of a slightly different set of independent variables . to define them ,",
    "we first introduce quantities @xmath149 as the values of corresponding angles  @xmath60 determined from the ` zero curvature ' condition @xmath150 with given _ other _ @xmath60 and lengths  @xmath62 in the simplitial complex .",
    "it is enough for us that @xmath151 and @xmath152 exist when the other @xmath60 and  @xmath62 stay close to their initial values .",
    "condition ( [ de_flat ] ) means that the three tetrahedra in the right - hand side of figure  [ fig1 ] can be put together in  @xmath6 .",
    "thus , angle  @xmath20 is correctly defined is this situation ( although no face  @xmath11 is present in the right - hand side diagram of figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we consider quantities @xmath145 for the ` new ' simplicial complex as functions of the following independent variables : edge lengths  @xmath146 and angles  @xmath147 , except for length  @xmath153 , instead of which we now take _ angle _",

    "denote the jacobian matrix of partial derivatives of components of @xmath145 with respect to our ` new ' variables as  @xmath161 .",
    "the fact that ( [ de_flat ] ) holds when @xmath162 identically in other variables  we call them ` non - psi '  means that the derivatives of @xmath145 with respect to these non - psi variables vanish .",
    "besides , the rest of @xmath145 , @xmath163 , depend on the non - psi variables , provided ( [ 3psi ] ) holds , in the same way as for the initial complex ( before the @xmath117 move ) , because the condition ( [ 3psi ] ) means that both sides of figure  [ fig1 ] can be superposed in  @xmath6 , and the immediate consequence of this is that @xmath145 , @xmath163 , are the same for the initial complex and one resulting from @xmath117 move .",
    "thus , @xmath161 has the following block - triangular form : @xmath164 \\hbox{\\boldmath $ \\ast$ } & & f_3^{\\rm old } \\end{pmatrix } , \\label{e**}\\ ] ] where @xmath165 is , of course , the @xmath166 matrix of derivatives of @xmath167 components with respect to variables  ( [ e * ] ) .",
    "matrix @xmath63 is obtained from @xmath161 by the right multiplication by a matrix  @xmath168 of partial derivatives of the set of variables @xmath169 with respect to the set @xmath170",
    ": @xmath171 the semicolons between groups of variables in parentheses correspond to the block decomposition of matrix  @xmath168 in the following formula which also reflects a block triangular form of  @xmath168 : @xmath172    one sees from formulas ( [ e * * ] ) , ( [ e * * * ] ) and  ( [ e4 * ] ) that the resulting change of @xmath122 under move @xmath117 is described as follows : @xmath173 the rightmost multiplier here is calculated easily : @xmath174 see formula ( 15 ) in @xcite ; the minus sign in  ( [ e5 * ] ) is due to @xmath20 being an _ exterior _ angle .",
    "so , what remains is to calculate @xmath175 .",
    "this determinant consists of three columns , each representing a partial derivative of three - component  @xmath167 in some  @xmath157 .",
    "consider , for instance , the derivative @xmath176 .",
    "it can be represented as a vector of _ unit length _ in a three - dimensional space , if we represent @xmath131 as a three - vector according to subsection  [ ss_seq ] , the paragraph after formula  ( [ cb ] ) . as for the direction of @xmath176 , it is determined ( up to a sign ) by the fact that the infinitesimal rotation corresponding to a differential  @xmath177 takes place in the two - dimensional plane orthogonal to two - face  @xmath178 .",
    "similar statements hold for two other derivatives @xmath179 and @xmath180 . to calculate the determinant made of these three unit vectors , one must know angles between them , and these angles are the same as between vectors @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 , where ` @xmath184 ' means the component of the respective vector _ orthogonal to _  @xmath185 . from these three latter vectors , one can readily make unit vectors , replacing them with @xmath186 on the other hand , the following equality involving a four - volume holds : @xmath187 \\overrightarrow{bd}_{\\bot\\overrightarrow{de}}\\\\[.8ex ] \\overrightarrow{cd}_{\\bot\\overrightarrow{de } } \\end{pmatrix}\\cdot l_{de}.\\ ] ] thus , our desired determinant , being also the determinant composed of vectors  ( [ e6 * ] ) , is @xmath188    multiplying ( [ e5 * ] ) by ( [ e7 * ] ) and dropping the possible minus sign which can always be eliminated by an odd basis vector permutation in some vector space , we get that _ @xmath122 has been multiplied , as a result of pachner move @xmath117 , by the value inverse to _  ( [ tau * ] ) .",
    "recalling formula  ( [ tau ] ) and the fact that all the change of torsion  @xmath124 is concentrated in @xmath122 , we see that theorem  [ th_2 - 3 ] is proved .",
    "if we also recall the changes in one- and two - dimensional cells resulting from the move @xmath117 , namely : new edge  @xmath128 appeared ; two - face @xmath11 disappeared , and two - faces @xmath189 appeared , we can write out the following _ invariant _ of moves  @xmath117 : @xmath190    it is already miraculous how invariant of moves  @xmath115 appears in this form of torsion multiplied by products of all volumes of certain dimensions in a simplicial complex , raised in some powers .",
    "moreover , we will see in subsection  [ ss_1 - 4 ] that formula  ( [ inv ] ) gives in fact an invariant of moves  @xmath116 as well !      a pachner move @xmath118 is depicted in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "( and one adjacent tetrahedron @xmath191 which does not take part in the move ) ]    it consists in dividing a tetrahedron @xmath3 into four tetrahedra @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 and  @xmath195 .",
    "tetrahedron @xmath191 in figure  [ fig2 ] does not take part in the move , but will be needed for our reasoning in this subsection",
    ".    it will be convenient for us to represent the move @xmath118 as a composition of a move @xmath196 and the already studied move @xmath117 . by move @xmath196",
    "we understand the following change of pseudotriangulation : we slightly inflate the two - face  @xmath11 and put a new vertex  @xmath197 inside the resulting volume , which we then represent as consisting of two tetrahedra @xmath192 and @xmath2 ( the order of vertices reflects their mutually inverse orientation ) .",
    "so , these two new tetrahedra are glued to each other by their faces @xmath198 , @xmath199 and  @xmath200 .",
    "the face @xmath11 of tetrahedron  @xmath192 is glued to the face of the same name of  @xmath191 , while the face @xmath11 of  @xmath2 is glued to the face of the same name of  @xmath3 . as we will need to distinguish between the two resulting faces @xmath11 in the simplicial complex",
    ", we will call below the face belonging to tetrahedron @xmath191 as simply  @xmath11 , while the other one  as  @xmath201 .",
    "if we now do the same move @xmath117 in tetrahedra @xmath2 and @xmath3 as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] , we will get exactly the right - hand - side diagram of figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "[ th_1 - 4 ] the same quantity ( [ inv ] ) invariant with respect to moves @xmath115 is also invariant under moves @xmath196 and thus under moves  @xmath116 .",
    "the following 0- , 1- and 2-cells are added to the simplicial complex as a result of move @xmath196 :    * one vertex @xmath197 , * three edges @xmath202 , * four two - faces @xmath203 .",
    "this leads to changes in matrices @xmath61 , @xmath63 and @xmath82 in algebraic complex  ( [ mc ] ) .",
    "we are going to explain that , for each of these matrices , one can just replace its minor , entering in formula  ( [ tau ] ) , with a bigger minor , containing all ` old ' rows and columns as well as some ` new ' ones .",
    "the values of new minors are obtained from those of the old ones by simple multiplication by ` small ' minors , whose rows and columns correspond to the new elements in triangulation , due to the same block - triangularity reasons as in subsection  [ ss_2 - 3 ] , with only a slight modification for matrix  @xmath61 .",
    "[ l * * ] minors in formula ( [ tau ] ) , taken for the initial ( before move @xmath196 ) simplicial complex , can be chosen in such way that @xmath141 contains the row  @xmath134 .",
    "consider a maximal nonvanishing minor of matrix  @xmath61 , and let the letter  @xmath204 mean , for the moment , all the vertex coordinates involved in this minor ( i.e. , it consists of partial derivatives of @xmath62 s and @xmath60 s with respect to exactly these coordinates ) .",
    "suppose the row @xmath134 is _ not _ in this minor .",
    "nevertheless , it is easy to see that the partial derivatives @xmath140 ( substitute all the mentioned coordinates in place of  @xmath204 ! ) can not all vanish : the angle  @xmath20 does depend nontrivially on vertex coordinates .",
    "the fact that not all coordinates are in  @xmath204 does not prevent this : the differentials of all remaining coordinates can anyhow be made zero by means of an overall infinitesimal rotation of space  @xmath6 , which acts upon these differentials according to the mapping  @xmath48 .    as @xmath140 is not all zero",
    ", it is possible to replace some row in @xmath141 with @xmath140 in such way that @xmath141 still does not vanish .",
    "note that there are no problems with the corresponding change in the columns of @xmath122 : as we assume that complex  ( [ mc ] ) is acyclic , @xmath122 necessarily changes in such way that the ratio @xmath142 remains the same .",
    "we continue the proof of theorem  [ th_1 - 4 ] . assuming that the initial @xmath141 has been taken as in lemma  [ l * * ] , we add to it columns corresponding to @xmath205 and rows corresponding to @xmath206 and  @xmath207 .",
    "some small complication is that the row  @xmath134 in the new minor has also to be changed with respect to the old minor .",
    "we now show how to get back to the ` old '  @xmath20 while at the same time transforming @xmath141 to a block triangular form .",
    "note that @xmath20 is the dihedral angle at face  @xmath11 in four - simplex @xmath208 , while @xmath209 is the angle at  @xmath11 in four - simplex @xmath210 .",
    "thus , @xmath211 where @xmath212 is the angle at  @xmath11 in the four - simplex @xmath213 _ before _ the move @xmath118 .",
    "hence , adding the row @xmath207 to the row @xmath134 in the new minor , we get a row not depending on the coordinates of vertex  @xmath197 , i.e. , having zeros at the positions corresponding to @xmath205 . moreover ,",
    "other matrix elements in this row are clearly the same as in the old minor .",
    "the resulting minor is block - triangular , because only @xmath206 and  @xmath207 depend on @xmath205 ( note that @xmath60 s for faces @xmath198 , @xmath199 and @xmath200 , as functions of vertex coordinates , are identical zeros ) .",
    "thus , @xmath214 to calculate the exterior form ratio , we rotate the coordinate system in such way that axis  @xmath215 becomes orthogonal to ( the hyperplane containing ) tetrahedron  @xmath192 .",
    "then , this ratio factors in a product of values @xmath216 ( compare formulas ( 31 ) and ( 32 ) in @xcite ) and @xmath217 ( which is the inverse value for the height of tetrahedron @xmath192 dropped on base @xmath11 ) .",
    "this means that , as a result of move @xmath196 , @xmath218    the minor of matrix @xmath63 should be enlarged by three columns @xmath219 and three rows corresponding to some components of the new  @xmath42 , i.e. , @xmath220 . even before specifying the choice of these components",
    ", we can state the block triangularity of the new minor , caused by the fact that only @xmath219 and no other length or angle differentials @xmath78 or  @xmath79 influence @xmath220 . to see this",
    ", we note that , in general , the influence on given  @xmath132 for a given edge  @xmath133 can be caused by length differentials for edges lying in the star of edge  @xmath133 ( because the lengths of these edges determine the dihedral angles at  @xmath133 ) and by  @xmath221 for faces  @xmath148 containing  @xmath133 . as , in our situation , each of the stars of @xmath202 consists of exactly two tetrahedra differing only in their orientations , any infinitesimal edge length changes obviously give zero @xmath222 on these edges .",
    "to define components of @xmath222 in a convenient way , we draw three separate coordinate systems for @xmath223 , @xmath224 and @xmath225 respectively . one thing , however , will be common for them all , namely axis  @xmath215 , which we draw orthogonally to ( the hyperplane containing ) tetrahedron  @xmath192 .",
    "the choice of one of two possible directions of  @xmath215 , as well as other axes defined below , is not important for us .",
    "the rest of the axes must be of course orthogonal to  @xmath215 and to each other ; we denote axis  @xmath204 for @xmath223 as  @xmath226 and so on , and we further specify the directions of these axes as follows :    * @xmath226 is orthogonal to the two - dimensional plane @xmath227 , * @xmath228 lies within the plane @xmath227 and is orthogonal to @xmath229 , * @xmath230 goes in or against the direction of @xmath229 ;    * @xmath231 is orthogonal to the plane @xmath232 , * @xmath233 lies within the plane @xmath232 and is orthogonal to @xmath234 , * @xmath235 goes in or against the direction of @xmath234 ;    * @xmath236 is orthogonal to the plane @xmath237 , * @xmath238 lies within the plane @xmath237 and is orthogonal to @xmath239 , * @xmath240 goes in or against the direction of @xmath239 .",
    "so , our matrix @xmath241 will contain rows corresponding to these components of  @xmath222 .",
    "consider its following submatrix : @xmath242 \\dfrac{\\partial(\\omega_{ae})_{yw}}{\\partial\\vartheta_{abe } } & \\dfrac{\\partial(\\omega_{ae})_{yw}}{\\partial\\vartheta_{bce } } & \\dfrac{\\partial(\\omega_{ae})_{yw}}{\\partial\\vartheta_{cae } } \\\\[2ex ] \\dfrac{\\partial(\\omega_{be})_{wx}}{\\partial\\vartheta_{abe } } & \\dfrac{\\partial(\\omega_{be})_{wx}}{\\partial\\vartheta_{bce } } & \\dfrac{\\partial(\\omega_{be})_{wx}}{\\partial\\vartheta_{cae } } \\end{pmatrix}. \\label{e8*}\\ ] ] here , when we take the component @xmath243 , the letter  @xmath204 stands , of course , for  @xmath226 ; similarly , @xmath244 in @xmath245 , and @xmath246 in @xmath247 .",
    "[ l * * * ] matrix ( [ e8 * ] ) has the following form : @xmath248 and thus its determinant is @xmath249 . here",
    "@xmath250 is the dihedral angle at edge  @xmath229 in tetrahedron  @xmath192 .",
    "consider , for instance , the equality @xmath251 .",
    "it holds because a rotation _ around _",
    "face  @xmath227 goes exactly _ in the plane _",
    "@xmath252 , so , the component @xmath253 is nothing but @xmath254 ; the sign depends on specific choices of axis directions and , as we have agreed , is not important for us , because we are calculating our invariant to within a sign .",
    "the equality @xmath255 is established almost as easily .",
    "of other equalitites for respective components of matrices ( [ e8 * ] ) and  ( [ e9 * ] ) , we mention @xmath256 which holds for a different reason : @xmath257 simply does not depend on the angle at face  @xmath232 , because this latter does not contain the edge  @xmath229 .",
    "recall that we are still within the proof of theorem  [ th_1 - 4 ] . joining the result of lemma  [ l * * * ] with block triangularity argument",
    ", we can state that @xmath258 it remains to study the change in @xmath123 . here",
    ", six columns are added , corresponding to the six not - yet - used components of @xmath223 , @xmath224 and  @xmath225 , and six rows corresponding to the six - component quantity  @xmath259 .",
    "block triangularity is ensured by the fact that @xmath259 is influenced only by @xmath222 of those edges which end in  @xmath197 .",
    "so , @xmath260 is multiplied by a @xmath261 determinant in order to obtain @xmath262 and , besides , this determinant factorizes in two @xmath166 determinants , the first of which corresponds to components of @xmath222 and  @xmath111 orthogonal to axis  @xmath215 , while the second  to components of type @xmath263 or  @xmath264 .",
    "the first @xmath166 determinant can be written as follows : @xmath265 remember that here ` @xmath266 ' are different for different  @xmath43 .",
    "it is not hard to understand that ( [ e10 * ] ) equals the volume of parallelepiped built on unit vectors going in the directions of axes @xmath267 , that is , @xmath268 the second @xmath166 determinant can be written as @xmath269 it equals the volume of parallelepiped built on unit vectors going along axes @xmath233 , @xmath236 and  @xmath238 .",
    "it is not hard to see that this volume equals the sine of angle between edges @xmath234 and  @xmath239 , which is @xmath270 combining the factors ( [ f4 * ] ) and  ( [ f4 * * ] ) , we can state that @xmath271    and now , combining ( [ f2 ] ) , ( [ f3 ] ) and  ( [ f4 ] ) , we see that torsion @xmath124 , defined according to formula  ( [ tau ] ) , is multiplied under the move @xmath196 by @xmath272 this means that theorem [ th_1 - 4 ] has been proved .",
    "in this paper , we have not given concrete examples of calculations .",
    "in fact , we plan to use our complex  ( [ mc ] ) not so much in its form presented in this paper as the basis for further modifications . in the forthcoming paper",
    "@xcite we intend , first , to demonstrate interesting properties of reducibility ( possibility to be decomposed into a direct sum ) for complex  ( [ mc ] ) and , second , make concrete calculations for some framed knots , using a suitable modification of complex  ( [ mc ] ) made in analogy with paper  @xcite .    of other ideas for the nearest future , we mention the idea of geometrizing simplicial complexes by putting more complicated geometric objects in correspondence to their elements . for instance , not only just a point in a euclidean or other space can correspond to a vertex in a simplicial complex but , say , a line segment lying in that space .",
