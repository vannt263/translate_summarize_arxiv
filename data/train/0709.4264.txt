    "continuous - in - time measurement theory  @xcite , or quantum trajectory theory , describes how an observer s state of knowledge of a quantum system ( known as the conditional state ) evolves given a measurement record . even in the absence of classical noise",
    ", such a trajectory follows a stochastic path in time , with the randomness being due to quantum uncertainty .",
    "these stochastic trajectories are either diffusive or jump - like in nature .",
    "diffusive trajectories usually arise when the observable being measured is only weakly coupled to the detector  @xcite , whereas jump - like behavior occurs when there is a large sudden change in the observers knowledge of the system state , a typical example of the latter being detection of a photon with a photomultiplier  @xcite .",
    "the evolution equation for this trajectory is called a stochastic master equation ( sme ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider measurement in circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed )  @xcite .",
    "this system consists of a cooper pair box , playing the role of an artificial atom , dispersively coupled to a 1-d transmission line resonator and is the circuit equivalent of cavity qed .",
    "it has the advantage that the qubit can be fixed at an antinode of the resonator which , due to its 1d configuration , has a very large vacuum electric field .",
    "this leads to very strong jaynes - cummings type coupling between the qubit and the resonator .",
    "this allows to probe a new regime of parameter space , where the resonator and qubit are _ strongly _ coupled via a dispersive interaction and no energy is exchanged between them . in this regime , the qubit causes a large state - dependent shift of the resonator frequency and thus by monitoring the signal transmitted through the resonator we can infer the qubit s state .",
    "an important feature of the quasi - one - dimensional circuit resonator is that it permits dispersive couplings @xmath0 times larger than for ordinary three - dimensional cavities .",
    "coupling of superconducting charge qubits to 3d microwave cavities has also been investigated theoretically  @xcite .    to go beyond previous theoretical works on this system ,",
    "we employ quantum trajectory theory  @xcite and a polaron transformation  @xcite to derive an effective sme for the qubit",
    ". it is well know in quantum optics that if the voltage of a cavity is weakly monitored , then the evolution of the conditional state of the cavity is given by the homodyne sme  @xcite . using this sme as a starting point",
    ", we show that if the rate at which information is coming out of the resonator is much larger then the rate at which information is being lost into unmonitored baths , then we can use a polaron transformation to eliminate the resonator and obtain a sme for the qubit only .",
    "the effective sme which is derived corresponds to a weak dispersive measurement of the qubit observable @xmath1 .",
    "this is akin to smes derived in refs .",
    "@xcite for a quantum dot monitored by a quantum point contact . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the smes are referred to as the quantum bayesian equations .",
    "they can be seen as the stratonovich version of the the it  smes presented here and in refs .",
    "we note that one can derive a similar equation by adiabatically eliminating the resonator from the qubit - resonator master equation using a similar technique as presented in @xcite .",
    "however , by using the present method , we are able to derive corrections to the various system rates .",
    "these rates are shown to agree very well with the solution of the total resonator - qubit conditional state found by numerically solving the homodyne sme .",

    "however , the full homodyne sme calculations ( red open diamonds ) do not agree with this expectation in the large drive case . although the mean jump time does increase with the measurement drive as expected by the zeno effect , its effect is not as large as that predicted by the simple model .",
    "we have investigated the measurement of a superconducting qubit using a dispersively coupled resonator . from the fully quantum mechanical model for the resonator and qubit dispersive interaction ,",
    "we have found an effective master equation for the qubit ( only ) under the presence of a measurement drive on the resonator .",
    "this was done by moving to a frame which takes into account the entanglement between the resonator and the qubit . with respect to the bare qubit - resonator master equation",
    ", the effective qubit master equation contains an additional , time - dependent decay channel which has the form of a dephasing process and which depends on the number of photons populating the resonator .",
    "this is referred to as measurement - induced dephasing  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the extra dephasing channel , the photon population of the resonator is also responsible for an ac - stark shift of the qubit transition frequency . as was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , and later reported experimentally in ref .",
    "@xcite , these effects lead to _ number splitting _ of the qubit spectrum in the limit where @xmath69 .",
    "we thus have obtained a very simple to solve ( 2 dimensional hilbert space ) effective model for the qubit dynamics that contains the essential physics .",
    "we believe that this is an interesting analytical , and numerical , tool to further explore the dispersive regime .",
    "we then focused on the situation where one is continuously monitoring the voltage at the output port of the resonator .",
    "in that situation , the conditional state of the combined system evolves according to the homodyne sme  @xcite . again moving to a frame that takes into account the qubit - resonator entanglement",
    ", we then obtained an effective sme for the qubit that is valid in the limit @xmath305 .",
    "the sme corresponds to a weak measurement of the qubit operator @xmath1 . as a result",

    "@xcite for a double quantum dot qubit monitored continuously by a quantum point contact ( although the results are presented in very different forms in all of these references ) .    from these results",
    ", we then showed how , in the limit that the measurement becomes strong , there is a cross - over in the qualitative behavior of the trajectories from diffusive to jump - like .",
    "this process relies on the @xmath153 decay channel for the qubit to jump from the excited to the ground state . as a result",
    ", we expect to see quantum jumps , with poisson statistics , in the measured homodyne current .",
    "moreover , in presence of a rabi drive on the qubit , we again saw that the trajectories evolve from diffusive to jump - like .",
    "in this situation and when the measurement drive is not too strong , the jump rate is given @xmath306 .",
    "this is due to a competition between the measurement drive that tends to lock the conditional state on one of the eigenstates of @xmath1 and the rabi drive that tends to flip the qubit .",
    "this is nothing but the zeno effect .",
    "however , as the measurement gets stronger , the simple dispersive hamiltonian approximation breaks down and the effective model fails to predict the correct mean jump time for the qubit .",
    "we found that the form of the trajectories are still consistant with the model , only the parameters appear to be renormalized by the stronger measurement drive .",
    "an interpretation of this discrepancy is that the resonator response is not instantaneous .",
    "when the qubit jumps , the resonator state will lag behind and as a result the effective separation in phase space between the two coherent states of the resonator corresponding to the two qubit states will be reduced . in turn",
    ", this can lead to a reduction of the measurement induced - dephasing .",
    "overall , the model obtained here can be used to obtain qualitative information about the qubit dynamics in the presence of dissipation , measurement and control .",

    ". these additional terms mix the various coefficients of the decomposition of @xmath317 and obtaining an effective master equation for the qubit only is no longer possible exactly .",
    "this can nevertheless be done in the small measurement amplitude limit .",
    "the case where a control and a measurement drive are acting on the system simultaneously is most interesting in the case where the measurement drive is of small amplitude .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a weak continuous measurement drive corresponding to about one photon was used to monitor rabi oscillations .",
    "when the measurement drive amplitude is increased , the qubit is dephased faster and coherent control is realized with less fidelity .    in the weak measurement limit @xmath373 , the matrix element of the displacement operator @xmath374 in the photon number basis can be approximated to @xmath375   \\\\ &",

    "to lowest order in @xmath280 , this reduces @xmath377 . making this replacement in the above expressions for the amplitudes , we find in this limit the following effective qubit master equation @xmath378 -i   \\frac{\\omega_r}{2}\\left[{{\\sigma}_{x}},{\\rho}\\right]\\\\ & + \\gamma_1 { { \\cal   d}[{{\\sigma}_{-}}]}{\\rho}+\\left[\\gamma_{\\phi } + \\gamma_{\\mathrm{d } } \\right]{{\\cal   d}[{{\\sigma}_{z } } ] } { \\rho}/2 . \\end{split } \\label{eq.reduced.rho.drive}\\ ] ] unsurprisingly , in the small @xmath280 limit , the only effect of a control drive is to flip the qubit at the rabi frequency @xmath282 .",
