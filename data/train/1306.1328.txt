    "charged dust particles embedded in a plasma environment are an ubiquitous phenomenon in nature.@xcite they are found in the interstellar medium,@xcite planetary magnetospheres,@xcite the upper atmosphere,@xcite and in industrial plasmas.@xcite dusty laboratory plasmas,@xcite containing self - organized dust clouds , serve moreover as model systems for studying the dynamic behavior of strongly coulomb - correlated systems of finite extent .    from the plasma physics point of view , the most important property of a dust particle is the charge it accumulates from the plasma .",
    "it controls the coupling to other dust particles and to external electromagnetic fields as well as the overall charge balance of the plasma . as",
    "a consequence various methods have been devised to measure the particle charge .",
    "they range from force balance methods for particles drifting in the plasma  @xcite or trapped in the plasma sheath  @xcite to methods based on wave dispersion,@xcite normal mode analysis,@xcite and dust cluster rotation.@xcite yet , the precise determination of the particle charge in a plasma environment remains a challenge .",
    "methods independent of the plasma parameters,@xcite which are usually not precisely known , require specific experimental configurations , long measurement times or can not yield the charge of individual dust particles .",
    "the phase - resolved resonance method,@xcite for instance , allows only a precise relative charge measurement . for an absolute charge measurement",
    "the potential profile in the vicinity of the particle has to be additionally obtained by langmuir probe measurements which however are only about 20% accurate .",
    "thus an optical measurement of the particle charge , independent of the plasma parameters , would be extremely useful .    the scattering of light by a small particle ( mie scattering  @xcite ) encodes  at least in principle  the particle charge.@xcite it enters the scattering coefficients through the electrical conductivity of the surplus electrons which modifies either the boundary conditions for the electromagnetic fields or the polarizability of the particle .",
    "to assess how and at which frequencies charges are revealed by the mie signal requires however not only a microscopic calculation of the surface and bulk conductivities but also a detailed analysis of the conductivities impact on the different scattering regimes the particle s dielectric constant gives rise to .",
    "so far , the dependence of the mie signal on the particle charge has not been investigated systematically . in our previous work  @xcite we made a first step to clarify this issue which has also been raised by rosenberg.@xcite we identified the extinction at anomalous optical resonances of dielectric particles with a strong transverse optical ( to ) phonon resonance in the dielectric constant to be sensitive to surplus electrons . in the present work",
    "we give a more comprehensive survey of mie scattering by small negatively charged dielectric particles .",
    "our aim is to identify over the whole frequency range , not only in the vicinity of anomalous resonances , features in the mie signal which respond to surplus electrons . from these features the surplus electron density of the particle",
    "could be determined optically via light scattering .",
    "after a brief outline of the mie theory of light scattering by small charged particles in the next section , we present in section iii results for the four generic scattering features which occur for a charged dielectric particle with a strong resonance in the dielectric constant at the to phonon frequency @xmath0 : low - frequency scattering , ordinary resonances below @xmath0 , anomalous resonances above @xmath0 , and high - frequency scattering .",
    "we investigate the intensity of the mie signal and its polarization .",
    "thereby we include ellipsometric techniques into our considerations .",
    "section iv finally summarizes the results and points out possibilities for an optical measurement of the particle charge .",
    "the scattering behavior of an uncharged dielectric particle is determined by its radius @xmath1 and frequency - dependent dielectric constant @xmath2 . for a negatively charged dielectric particle light scattering",
    "is also influenced by the electric conductivity of the surplus electrons .",
    "whether surplus electrons are trapped inside the particle or in a surface layer around it depends on the electron affinity @xmath3 of the particle.@xcite    for @xmath4 , as it is the case for instance for mgo and lif,@xcite the conduction band inside the dielectric is above the potential outside the particle .",
    "electrons do not penetrate into the dielectric .",
    "instead they are trapped in the image potential in front of the surface.@xcite the image potential is due to a surface mode associated with the to phonon .",
    "the interaction of an electron with the surface mode comprises a static part , which induces the image potential,@xcite and a dynamic part , which enables momentum relaxation parallel to the surface limiting the surface conductivity.@xcite the phonon - limited surface conductivity @xmath5 , calculated in our previous work  @xcite using the memory function approach,@xcite modifies the boundary condition for the magnetic field at the surface of the grain.@xcite    for @xmath6 , as it is the case for instance for al@xmath7o@xmath8 , cu@xmath7o and pbs , the conduction band inside the dielectric lies below the potential outside the particle .",
    "electrons thus accumulate in the conduction band where they form an extended space charge.@xcite its width , limited by the screening in the dielectric , is typically larger than a micron . for micron - sized particles we can thus assume a homogeneous electron distribution in the bulk .",
    "the bulk conductivity is limited by scattering with a longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonon  @xcite and can be also calculated  @xcite within the memory function approach .",
    "the bulk conductivity of the surplus electrons @xmath9 leads to an additional polarizability per volume @xmath10 which alters the refractive index .",
    "the scattering behavior of the particle is controlled by the scattering coefficients .",
    "they are determined by expanding the incident ( @xmath11 ) plane wave into spherical vector harmonics and matching the reflected ( @xmath12 ) and transmitted ( @xmath13 ) waves at the boundary of the sphere.@xcite in the case of @xmath6 the boundary conditions at the surface are given by @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",

    "surplus charges affect however the low - frequency regime and the anomalous optical resonances .",
    "we have identified three charge - dependent features of light scattering : ( i ) a charge - induced increase in extinction for low - frequencies , ( ii ) a blue - shift of the anomalous extinction resonance , and ( iii ) a rapid variation of one of the two polarization angles at the anomalous extinction resonance . at low frequencies energy relaxation",
    "is inhibited for uncharged particles as the imaginary part of the dielectric constant is very small .",
    "surplus charges enable energy relaxation on the grain through their electrical conductivity which has a significant real part at low frequencies .",
    "this leads to increased absorption at low frequencies . above the to phonon frequency the real part of the dielectric constant is negative which leads to anomalous optical resonances .",
    "surplus charges enter into the resonance condition through the imaginary part of their electrical conductivity .",
    "they lead to a resonance blue - shift which is most significant for sub - micron - sized particles .",
    "moreover , at the anomalous resonances the phase of the resonant scattering coefficients varies rapidly .",
    "this causes the opening and closing  characterized by the angle @xmath175of the polarization ellipse of the reflected light .",
    "surplus charges lead to the rapid variation in @xmath175 being shifted to higher frequency .",
    "we suggest to use these charge signatures in the mie signal to measure the particle charge . for plasmonic particles charge - induced resonance shifts",
    "have already been detected experimentally for metallic nanorods which were charged by an electrolytic solution  @xcite and for an array of nanodiscs exposed to an argon plasma.@xcite    in order to detect the charge - sensitive effects of light scattering by dust particles in a dusty plasma would require to shine infra - red light through the plasma and to measure light attenuation or the polarization of reflected light . the low - frequency increase in extinction or the shift in the polarization angle @xmath175 could be observed with monochromatic light while the resonance shift would require a frequency dependent extinction measurement .",
    "this would not only allow a determination of the particle charge without knowing any plasma parameters but also of nanodust particles  @xcite where traditional techniques can not be applied at all .",
    "eventually suitable particles with a strong charge sensitivity ( e.g. al@xmath7o@xmath8 or pbs particles ) could even be employed as minimally invasive electric plasma probes .",
    "the particles would accumulate a charge depending on the local plasma environment .",
    "performing simultaneously an optical charge measurement and a traditional force measurement  @xcite would then allow to infer the local electron density and temperature at the position of the probe particle .",
