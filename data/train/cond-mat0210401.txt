    "the back - scattering effects from the impurity potentials and sample boundaries were taken into account .",
    "it turns out that the back - scattering affects the interference patterns considerably in two cases : first , if the impurity is located close to the injector or the detector qpc ( within the phase coherence length ) , or second , if two impurities are located at a short distance from each other .",
