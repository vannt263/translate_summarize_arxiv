    "velocity dispersion profiles and surface density profiles are among the most basic tools for investigating the structure of star clusters .",
    "however , such investigations indicate that the region around the tidal radius , at which the internal acceleration of a star cluster is similar to the tidal acceleration due to the galactic tidal field , is particularly poorly understood .",
    "+ velocity dispersion profiles sometimes show peculiarities which have been discussed in the literature .",
    "@xcite , for example , observed a flattening in the outer parts of the velocity dispersion profile of the galactic globular cluster m15 which they interpreted as an effect of tidal heating by the general galactic tide or by tidal shocks .",
    "@xcite also found a flattening of the velocity dispersion profile for @xmath3 cen and more recently for other galactic globular clusters like ngc6171 , ngc7099 and ngc288 @xcite .",
    "the deviation from an expected keplerian fall - off in the velocity dispersion profile occurred in all clusters at radii where the internal gravitational acceleration is about @xmath4 and was therefore interpreted by scarpa et al .",
    "as a hint of modified newtonian dynamics @xcite in globular clusters .",
    "alternatively , they briefly discussed the possible effect of tidal heating or a dark matter halo on the cluster stars .",
    "+ on the contrary , @xcite found that by fitting a @xcite model , which has a less sharp cut - off at the tidal radius than the commonly used @xcite model , to the re - analyzed @xmath3 cen data , its velocity dispersion profile could be explained without modifying newtonian gravity and without adding dark matter .",
    "similar investigations of cluster profiles , e.g. @xcite and @xcite , were also not in favour of mond . + but it is not only the velocity dispersion profiles of star clusters which behave strangely at the tidal boundary ; their surface density profiles also show peculiarities and sometimes controversial behaviour .",
    "+ @xcite showed that the surface density profiles of many globular clusters can be fitted by a simple analytical formula having a sharp cut - off radius , which could be interpreted as the tidal radius of the cluster .",
    "later he derived a set of physically motivated models , with a similar cut - off radius corresponding to an energy cut - off in the energy distribution function of the cluster stars , which provided an even better fit to cluster profiles @xcite .",
    "+ in contrast to that , @xcite , and more recently @xcite , found that young massive clusters in the lmc show an exponential surface density profile without any tidal truncation at the expected tidal radius .",
    "they interpreted these findings as being due to tidal debris which was expelled at birth from the clusters and has not had time to disperse yet .",
    "+ furthermore , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite find the outer halo milky - way globular clusters palomar 13 , whiting 1 and am 4 , respectively , to have a significant excess of stars at the tidal boundary , which makes any fit to the surface density data very inaccurate .",
    "for all clusters they find the radial surface density profile , @xmath5 , to be well represented by a power - law @xmath6 with slopes of about @xmath7 .",
    "this excess of stars is interpreted by the authors as heavy mass loss in a final stage of dissolution .",
    "the same was found for palomar 5 , which is a well studied mw globular cluster close to the apogalacticon of its orbit @xcite .",
    "+ moreover , @xcite showed that most globular clusters of the milky way , the lmc and smc , as well as of the fornax dwarf spheroidal , are more extended than can be explained by @xcite models , and therefore are better represented by @xcite models . in this context",
    "they emphasised the lack of physical understanding of this phenomenon . + on the contrary , @xcite found that of 23 young massive clusters in m31 most were better fitted by @xcite models as these clusters do not show extended haloes . + as a consequence of this lack of understanding , @xcite asked in their investigation how robust the physical parameters are which were derived in such analyses .",
    "this they tried to estimate by analyzing artificial clusters in the same way as the real observations .",
    "a similar analysis has also been performed by @xcite , although they tested the analytic formula of @xcite with artificial observations under various limiting conditions .",
    "both investigations came to the conclusion that physical parameters can in principle be well recovered from such idealized mock observations .",
    "+ but probably the idealized nature of these investigations is misleading , since both tests were performed with dynamically unevolved clusters .",
    "however , a self - consistent test of deriving physical parameters from a set of numerical computations of star clusters with a range of initial parameters has not been performed yet .",
    "just a few investigations have touched this topic so far by means of numerical computations ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that fast codes for globular cluster integration like fokker - planck or monte - carlo codes are not able to address this problem properly , as they can not follow the evolution of the tidal debris and are restricted to cut - off criteria in energy or angular momentum space .",
    "moreover , limits in computational power prevented us from carrying out such investigations by means of collisional @xmath1-body codes .",
    "but the recent improvements in computational speed of @xmath1-body codes and the availability of accelerator hardware ( grapes , gpus ) now allows us to study the dynamical evolution of star clusters with masses of up to several times @xmath8 . + thus , by computing various star clusters in a range of tidal conditions over several gyr we investigate the structure of star clusters , and in particular the evolution of the region around the tidal radius - the transition region between the star cluster and the tidal tails - in terms of velocity dispersion and surface density profiles .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first , a brief introduction to the topic of potential escapers is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : pesc ] as these stars play a key role in this investigation .",
    "then a few methodological remarks will be made in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] before we come to the velocity dispersion profiles in sec .",
    "[ sec : vdp ] and then to the surface density profiles in sec .",
    "[ sec : sdp ] . in the last section",
    "we will give a summary with a brief discussion .",
    "a major problem in producing velocity dispersion and surface density profiles from observations is how to disentangle cluster members from background / foreground stars . by only looking at stars which are inside",
    "a projected , estimated jacobi radius with similar radial velocities and colours it is at least possible to distinguish between the cluster population and field stars . even here",
    ", however , the question arises whether the choice of the cut in radial velocity significantly influences the results , especially of the velocity dispersion profile ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , one has to be careful with how the jacobi radius was estimated , i.e. was it evaluated using a mass estimate and was the mass estimated through the velocity dispersion ? or was the jacobi radius estimated by a cut - off radius in the profile and is the assumption that this cut - off radius is equal to the jacobi radius reasonable ?",
    "what if the cluster is on an eccentric orbit about the galaxy ; how does this influence the cut - off radius ?",
    "+ besides , the observer does not know if the stars in the sample which was extracted in this way are actually members of the cluster or if they are already evaporated from the cluster and are now part of its tidal debris , and just lie in projection within the cluster . + but even if the observer could distinguish between stars inside the jacobi radius and those that are beyond this radius , it would still be unclear if the stars in the sample are bound to the cluster or have already gained enough energy to leave the cluster but just havent done so yet .",
    "these , so - called , potential escapers will have a significant influence on both the surface density and the velocity dispersion profile , if there is a non - negligible fraction of them in the cluster , as these stars will make the profiles deviate from any theory which does not take them into account - which most theoretical approaches do not .",
    "+ in numerical modelling of star clusters we have detailed phase space information on every single star in the computation . mainly by numerical investigations it has been found that the escape process through which stars escape from a cluster in a constant tidal field , e.g. on a circular orbit about a galaxy , is divided into two steps .",
    "first the stars get unbound via two - body relaxation , thus on a relaxation time scale ( ignoring constants ) , @xmath9 where @xmath1 is the number of stars in the cluster and @xmath10 is the crossing time of the cluster ( note that we neglected the slowly varying coulomb logarithm in eq .",
    "[ eq : trel ] , for further details see e.g. @xcite ) . in the second step , these energetically unbound stars , or potential escapers , with specific energy @xmath11 higher than some critical escape energy @xmath12 , escape from the cluster on an escape time scale which is given by ( @xcite , equation 9 therein ) @xmath13 where @xmath12 is the critical energy at the lagrange points , i.e. at the jacobi radius . from this",
    "it follows that the excess energy can be written as @xmath14 on the other hand , the relation @xmath15 holds , whence we find that @xmath16 hence , a fraction of stars with excess energy @xmath17 escapes on a time scale @xmath18 and the time scale of mass loss , e.g. the time on which a cluster dissolves , @xmath19 , is given by @xmath20 which was also found by @xcite .",
    "this result is in contrast to the ` classic ' picture where the dissolution times of clusters scale with the relaxation time ( see e.g. @xcite ) , i.e. @xmath21 and demonstrates the importance of potential escapers on the dissolution process of star clusters .",
    "the remaining question is whether the population of potential escapers is large enough that it also has an influence on the velocity dispersion and surface density profiles",
    ". for clusters of a few @xmath2 stars in a constant tidal field @xcite finds about 10 - 20% of all stars within the jacobi radius to be potential escapers , @xcite even find the fraction of potential escapers for similar clusters to be 1/3 of the cluster population .",
    "moreover , @xcite found that for clusters in a constant tidal field the fraction of potential escapers varies with the number of stars within a cluster approximately as @xmath22 .",
    "thus , this fraction should still be significant for high-@xmath1 globular clusters .",
    "+ star clusters in time - dependent tidal fields have not been investigated in this respect yet , but as tidal perturbations tend to increase the energy of the stars in a cluster ( e.g. @xcite ) , the population of potential escapers should be even larger in such clusters . thus , potential escapers should have a significant effect on both the velocity dispersion and the surface density profiles of all kinds of star clusters .",
    "when analyzing velocity dispersion and surface density data of star clusters , confusion over nomenclature often arises .",
    "therefore we strictly stick to the following three terms : _ profiles _ , _ models _ and _ templates_. the first will be used for the data , which in our case comes from @xmath1-body computations but might also originate from observations .",
    "the term _ models _ will be used for physically motivated distribution functions such as those proposed by @xcite or @xcite . the word _",
    "templates _ covers the analytic expressions which have been found empirically and which do not originate from a physical derivation by being solutions of the collisionless boltzmann equation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the word template hereby emphasises their artificial nature .",
    "+ further confusion arises about the term _ tidal radius_. again there is a physically motivated and an empirical version .",
    "the former is the radius at which the internal gravitational acceleration equals the tidal acceleration from the host galaxy ( see e.g. @xcite ) . this will be named _",
    "jacobi radius _ in our text .",
    "the empirical tidal radius is defined through the cut - off radius of the models and templates which are fitted to the profiles .",
    "we will refer to this cut - off radius as _ edge radius _ here and would like to emphasise that jacobi radius and edge radius are two different concepts and therefore are not necessarily equal .",
    "in fact , we will show that the two are often significantly different and that conclusions from a fitted edge radius should be drawn with caution .",
    "+ note also that the results of this investigation can not be easily scaled to more massive globular clusters , as the relative importance of tidal features depends on the mass of the cluster , since the mass in the tidal debris is proportional to the mass - loss rate of the cluster and the mass - loss rate does not scale linearly with cluster mass , @xmath23 , but rather with @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "+ moreover , even though we have some concentrated clusters in our sample this investigation focuses on less concentrated clusters , with a ratio of projected half mass radius to jacobi radius between @xmath25 because @xcite showed that clusters with ratios of @xmath26 can not be properly fitted by either @xcite templates or @xcite models as their ratio of @xmath27 is too high . therefore",
    ", our conclusions mainly hold for less concentrated clusters which @xcite named the _ extended cluster population _ , and which are likely to be on the main sequence of cluster evolution @xcite , the final and universal stage of cluster evolution after core collapse , where the ratio @xmath27 only depends on the mass of the cluster . + in the following sections we will first give some details about our data set before we explain how we extract the velocity dispersion and surface density profiles .",
    "thereafter we briefly describe the analytical templates which are used in this investigation and specify our fitting method .",
    ".overview of all computed models .",
    "@xmath28 gives the apogalactic radius of the cluster orbit and @xmath29 the corresponding eccentricity .",
    "the latter is defined as @xmath30 with @xmath28 being the apogalactic radius of the cluster orbit , and @xmath31 being the perigalactic radius .",
    "@xmath27 gives the initial concentration of the model , whereas @xmath32 is the initial half - mass radius .",
    "the clusters are divided into three categories : extended clusters in a constant tidal field ( a0-d0 ) , extended clusters in time - dependent tidal fields ( a1-d3 ) and compact clusters ( a0c - d0c ) .",
    "note that each model has initially @xmath33 stars , a lower stellar mass limit of @xmath34 and an upper limit of @xmath35 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]"
