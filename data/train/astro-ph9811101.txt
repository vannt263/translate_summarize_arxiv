    "agn environment studies , from host galaxy to galaxy cluster scales , provide information on the link between agn activity and tidal interactions and of differences of the environments due to intrinsic agn properties or an evolution with z. obtained results have to be considered in particular within unified schemes of active galaxies . following earlier studies at low z , rqqs reside in spiral hosts and within poor environments while radio  loud qsos ( rlqs ) reside in elliptical galaxies and tend to lie within clusters of abell richness class 01 . but this picture has gained more complexity since some rqqs have recently been found also within elliptical hosts ( e.g.  bahcall et al .",
    "moreover , few observations at z@xmath01 seem to show both rlqs and rqqs residing in comparable compact groups of possibly starbursting galaxies ( e.g.  hutchings et al .",
    "1995 ) which would suggest a change of the environments of rqqs at intermediate z.",
    "during an ongoing multicolour imaging survey of qsos , we obtained deep r band images ( r@xmath124.5 , 0.8@xmath2fwhm@xmath21.7  ) of 20 qsos within the range 0.75@xmath2z@xmath20.85 .",
    "observations were made with the calar alto and the eso / mpg2.2 m telescopes using cafos and efosc2 and total integration times of typically @xmath11h@xmath3target of the finally coadded frames .",
    "the subsample presented here contains 16 rqqs ( no radio flux in the veron  catalogue ) and 4 rlqs .",
    "all fields were carefully selected using the dss and ned to avoid e.g. the contamination by known galaxy clusters . for detection , deblending , classification and photometry of sources we used the sextractor package ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) accompanied by manual checks of the frames . in almost all cases , faint close companion candidates of the qsos , or even hints for tidal interactions are present , suggesting that the qsos are not isolated . in figure 1 ( right )",
    "we show e.g.  the 20(110kpc at z@xmath4 , h@xmath5=75 , q@xmath60.5 ) field around 1211 + 0848 ( z=0.81 , center ) including a lightbridge from the qso towards a faint galaxy . as a first object distribution analysis of all fields ,",
    "we measured the number of faint ( r@xmath020 ) sources within boxes of increasing size ( r@xmath7100500kpc ) , each centered on the qsos .",
    "then we compared these number densities with the average object density obtained from the field outside the largest box . due to our large field sizes ( @xmath08 ) , an appropriate determination of field counts could be obtained .",
    "figure 1 ( left ) shows e.g.  an increase of the number counts towards q 13400020 ( z@xmath70.79 ) compared to the average counts , which are represented by the short dashed line ( and their poission scatter represented by the long dashed lines ) .",
    "error bars of the box counts are also from poission statistics . in 50% of all cases",
    "we have found a trend of increasing number counts towards the qsos ( 8 of 16 rqqs , 2 of 4 rlqs ) , whereas in five cases an excess appears more compact and is concentrated within @xmath2200kpc around the qsos .",
    "we suggest that they reside at least in groups of galaxies .",
    "this preliminary analysis already shows evidence for rqqs at intermediate z to be located in a diversity of sourroundings more comparable to rlqs than to their low redshift counterparts .",
    "our further detailed statistical and multicolour analysis as well as an spectroscopic follow  up program with the vlt and het should confirm , if we either see physical associations of galaxies with the qsos or foreground objects .",
