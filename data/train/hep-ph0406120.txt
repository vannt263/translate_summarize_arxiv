    "high energy physics and cosmology are two complementary areas with a rich and fruitful interface .",
    "they both enter the description of the physical processes during the early stages of our universe .",
    "high energy physics leads to the notion of topological defects , which imply a number of cosmological consequences .",
    "once we compare the theoretical predictions of models motivated by high energy physics against cosmological data , we induce constraints or , in other words , we fix the free parameters of the models .",
    "this is the philosophy of our study .",
    "even though the particle physics standard model ( sm ) has been tested to a very high precision , evidence of neutrino masses  @xcite proves that one should go beyond this model .",
    "an extension of the sm gauge group can be accomplished in the framework of supersymmetry ( susy ) . at present , susy is the only viable theory for solving the gauge hierarchy problem . moreover , in the supersymmetric standard model the gauge coupling constants of the strong , weak and electromagnetic interactions , with susy broken at the tev - scale , meet at a single point @xmath11 gev .",
    "these are called supersymmetric grand unified theories ( susy guts ) .",
    "an acceptable susy gut model should be consistent with the standard model as well as with cosmology .",
    "susy guts can provide the scalar field needed for inflation , they can explain the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe , and they can provide a candidate for cold dark matter , known as the lightest superparticle .",
    "usually models of susy guts suffer from the appearance of undesirable stable topological defects , which are mainly monopoles , but also domain walls .",
    "topological defects appear via the kibble mechanism  @xcite .",
    "a common mechanism to get rid of the unwanted topological defects , is to introduce one or more inflationary stages .",
    "inflation essentially consists of a phase of accelerated expansion which took place at a very high energy scale .",
    "in addition , inflation provides a natural explanation for the origin of the large scale structure and the associated temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation . on the other hand",
    ", one has to address the question of whether it is needed fine - tuning of the parameters of the inflationary model .",
    "this is indeed the case in some nonsupersymmetric versions of inflation and it leads to the naturalness issue .",
    "even though susy models of hybrid inflation were for long believed to circumvent these fine - tuning issues , our study shows that this may not be the case , unless we invoke the curvaton mechanism for the origin of the initial density fluctuations .",
    "the study we present here is the continuation of ref .",
    "@xcite , where they were examined all possible spontaneously symmetry breaking ( ssb ) schemes from a large gauge group down to the sm gauge group , in the context of susy guts .",
    "assuming standard supersymmetric hybrid inflation , there were found all models which are consistent with high energy physics and cosmology .",
    "namely , there were selected all models which can solve the gut monopole problem , lead to baryogenesis after inflation and are consistent with proton lifetime measurements .",
    "that study led to the conclusion that in all acceptable ssb patterns , the formation of cosmic strings is unavoidable , and some times it is accompanied by the formation of embedded strings .",
    "the strings which form at the end of inflation have a mass which is proportional to the inflationary scale . here , we find the inflationary scale , which coincides with the string mass scale . since our analysis is within global supersymmetry , we examine whether the value of the inflaton is at least a few orders of magnitude smaller than the planck scale . as we show , global supersymmetry is sufficient in the case of f - term inflation , while d - term inflation necessitates the supergravity framework .",
    "we organise the rest of the paper as follows : in section ii , we discuss the theoretical framework of our study .",
    "we briefly review the choice of the gauge groups we consider and we state the results about ssb schemes allowed from particle physics and cosmology as well as the topological defects left after the last inflationary era .",
    "we briefly review the theory of cmb temperature fluctuations .",
    "we then discuss inflation within n=1 susy guts , first in the context of f - term and then in the context of d - term inflation . in section iii , we describe our analysis as well as our findings for the mass scale and the strings contribution to the cmb .",
    "we first discuss f - term and then that of d - term inflation .",
    "we show that f - term inflation can be addressed in the context of global supersymmetry .",
    "we then show that d - term inflation has to be studied within local supersymmetry and we give the scalar potential for d - term inflation , taking into account radiative and supergravity ( sugra ) corrections .",
    "we round up with our conclusions in section iv . in appendix a , we list the allowed ssb schemes of large gauge groups down to the standard model , found in ref .",
    "@xcite , which are allowed by particle physics and cosmology .",
    "grand unified theories imply a sequence of phase transitions associated with the ssb of the gut gauge group @xmath12 down to the standard model gauge group @xmath13 .",
    "the energy scale at which this sequence of ssbs starts is @xmath14 gev .",
    "as our universe has undergone this series of phase transitions , various kinds of topological defects may have been left behind as the consequence of ssb schemes , via the kibble mechanism  @xcite . among the various kinds of stable topological defects , monopoles and domain walls are undesirable , since they lead to catastrophic cosmological implications , while textures do not have important cosmological consequences .",
    "to get rid of the unwanted topological defects one may employ the mechanism of cosmological inflation .",
    "considering supersymmetric grand unified theories is motivated by several constraints , coming from both particle physics and cosmology .",
    "it is indeed the only viable framework to solve the hierarchy problem .",
    "in addition , it allows for a unification of strong , weak and electromagnetic interactions at a sufficiently high scale to be compatible with proton lifetime measurements . from the point of view of cosmology",
    ", susy guts can provide a good candidate for dark matter , namely the lightest supersymmetric particle .",
    "moreover , it offers various candidates for playing the rle of the inflaton field and it can give naturally a flat direction for slow - roll inflation .",
    "supersymmetry can be formulated either as a global or as a local symmetry , in which case gravity is included and the theory is called supergravity .",
    "global supersymmetry can be seen as a limit of supergravity and it is a good approximation provided the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of all relevant fields are much smaller than the planck mass .    in a supersymmetric theory ,",
    "the tree - level potential for a scalar field is the sum of an f - term and a d - term .",
    "these two terms have rather different properties and in all proposed hybrid inflationary models only one of the two terms dominates .",
    "in supersymmetric hybrid inflation , the superpotential couples an inflaton field to a pair of higgs fields that are responsible for one symmetry breaking in the ssb scheme .",
    "this class of inflationary models is considered natural  @xcite within susy guts in the sense that the only extra field which is added , except the fields needed to build the gut itself , is a singlet scalar field .",
    "this extra field is however likely to be anyway needed to build the gut model , so that it constraints the higgs fields to acquire a vev .",
    "moreover , it is not spoiled by radiative corrections and supergravity corrections can be kept small for f - term inflation .",
    "we would like to mention that generically , f - term inflation suffers from the so - called @xmath15-problem , because usually , the supergravity corrections induce contribution of order unity to the slow roll parameter @xmath16 . this effective mass term for the inflaton field would spoil the slow roll condition  @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of a minimal kahler potential , which is what is considered hereafter , this problem is lifted by a cancelation of the problematic mass terms .",
    "this can however be seen as a fine tunning since a minimal kahler potential is not well motivated for example from the point of view of the string theory  @xcite .",
    "finally it has been stated that such inflationary models are successful in the sense that they do not require any fine tuning , but we show that this last point has to be revisited .",
    "f - term inflation can occur naturally within the guts framework when for example , a gut gauge group @xmath17 is broken down to the sm at an energy @xmath18 according to @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a pair of gut higgs superfields in nontrivial complex conjugate representations , which lower the rank of the group by one unit when acquiring nonzero vev .",
    "the inflationary phase takes place at the beginning of the symmetry breaking @xmath21 .",
    "f - term inflation is based on the globally supersymmetric renormalisable superpotential @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a gut gauge singlet left handed superfield and @xmath24 are as defined above , with @xmath0 and @xmath3 two constants ( @xmath3 has dimensions of mass ) which can both be taken positive with field redefinition . the chiral superfields @xmath25 are taken to have canonical kinetic terms .",
    "the above superpotential is the most general superpotential consistent with an r - symmetry under which @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "we note that an r - symmetry can ensure that the rest of the renormalisable terms are either absent or irrelevant .",
    "d - term inflation is derived from the superpotential @xmath28 where @xmath29 are three chiral superfields and @xmath6 is the superpotential coupling .",
    "d - term inflation requires the existence of a nonzero fayet - iliopoulos term @xmath9 , which can be added to the lagrangian only in the presence of a u(1 ) gauge symmetry , under which , the three chiral superfields have charges @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "thus , d - term inflation requires a scheme , like @xmath33 this extra u(1 ) gauge symmetry symmetry can be of a different origin  @xcite . in what follows",
    ", we consider a nonanomalous u(1 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "we note however that one could instead consider a situation realised in heterotic string theories , where there is an anomalous d - term arising from an anomalous u(1)@xmath34 , which can contribute to the vacuum energy  @xcite .",
    "clearly , the symmetry breaking at the end of the inflationnary phase implies that cosmic strings are always formed at the end of d - term hybrid inflation .    in the ssb schemes studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can naturally incorporate an era of f-/d - term inflation .",
    "all ssb schemes from grand unified gauge groups @xmath35 of rank at the most equal to 8 down to the standard model gauge group @xmath36 have been considered .",
    "initially , the group @xmath35 was chosen to be one of the following ones : su(5 ) , so(10 ) , su(6 ) , e@xmath37 , su(7 ) , so(14 ) , su(8 ) , and su(9 ) .",
    "in addition , the choice of @xmath35 was limited to simple gauge groups which contain @xmath38 , have a complex representation , are anomaly free and take into account some of the major observationnal constraints of particle physics and cosmology .",
    "the above @xmath39 symmetry is a sub - group of the @xmath40 gauge symmetry which is contained in various gauge groups and it plays the rle of r - parity .",
    "r - parity can only appear in grand unified gauge groups which contain @xmath41 .",
    "there were considered as many possible embeddings of @xmath38 in @xmath35 as one can find in the literature and it was examined whether defects are formed during the ssb patterns of @xmath35 down to @xmath38 , and of which kind they are . assuming standard hybrid f - term inflation there were disregarded all ssb patterns where monopoles or domain walls are formed after the end of the last possible inflationary era . in addition , there were disregarded ssb schemes with broken r - parity since the proton would decay too rapidly as compared to super - kamiokande measurements .",
    "it was also required that the gauged u(1)@xmath42 symmetry , is broken at the end of inflation so that a non thermal leptogenesis can explain the baryon / antibaryon asymmetry in the universe .",
    "su(5 ) , su(6 ) , su(7 ) are thus not acceptable groups for particle physics , since su(5 ) leads to the formation of stable monopoles , while minimal su(6 ) and minimal su(7 ) do not contain u(1)@xmath43 .    the ssb schemes compatible with high energy physics and cosmology , as given in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , are listed in appendix a.    it was concluded that within the framework of the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , there are not any acceptable ssb schemes without cosmic strings after the last inflationary era .",
    "the analysis we present below can therefore be applied to all these models .",
    "we would like to note that even if we relax the requirement that the gauged @xmath44 symmetry is broken at the end of inflation , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite remain unchanged .    even if one also allows for patterns with broken r - parity at low energy , cosmic strings",
    "formation is still very generic . to consider these cases , one should however find a mechanism to protect proton lifetime from very dangerous dimension 4 operators .",
    "strings formed during the ssb phase transitions leading from a large gauge group @xmath35 down to the g@xmath45 are of two types : topological strings , called cosmic strings , and embedded strings which are not topologically stable and in general they are not dynamically stable either .    clearly , as we discussed earlier , in the case of d - term inflation , cosmic strings are always present at the end of the inflationary era .",
    "the cmb temperature anisotropies provide a powerful test for theoretical models aiming at describing the early universe .",
    "the characteristics of the cmb multipole moments , and more precisely the position and amplitude of the acoustic peaks , as well as the statistical properties of the cmb temperature anisotropies , can be used to discriminate among theoretical models , as well as to constrain the parameters space .",
    "the spherical harmonic expansion of the cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies , as a function of angular position , is given by @xmath46 with @xmath47 where @xmath48 stands for the @xmath49-dependent window function of the particular experiment .",

    "note that the previous expression is only valid for the standard cold dark matter model .",

    ", the curvaton field first dominates the energy density of the universe , and then ( during the rde ) it decays and reheats the universe .",

    "@xcite , the end of the inflationary era is accompanied by strings formation  , which are cosmic strings ( topological defects ) , sometimes accompagnied by embedded strings ( not topologically stable and in general not dynamically stable either ) .",
    "let us first calculate the contribution to the quadrupole temperature anisotropy coming from the cosmic strings network .    at this point",
    ", we would like to bring to the attention of the reader that since the calculation of the angular power spectrum induced by a cosmic strings network relies on heavy numerical simulations , this issue remains still open .",
    "more precisely , to obtain the power spectrum from numerical simulations with cosmic strings , one must take into account the `` three - scale model ''  @xcite of cosmic strings networks , the small - scale structure ( wiggliness ) of the strings , the microphysics of the strings network , as well as the expansion of the universe .",
    "this is indeed a rather difficult task , and to our knowledge no currently available simulation leading to the @xmath81 includes all of them .",
    "moreover , all simulations of cosmic strings are referred to nambu - goto strings , and this is probably the most unrealistic case   at least , but not last , there is the issue of the appropriate initial conditions for the time evolution of the cosmic strings network .",
    "more precisely , we do not know of any numerical simulation leading to the @xmath82 , where the initial configuration of the strings network was other than the one obtained by assigning at random values to a phase variable on a cubic lattice .",

    "more precisely , in the framework of generic susy guts , we study the consequences of simple hybrid inflation models in the context of some realistic cosmological scenario .",
    "we then compare the observational predictions of these models in order to constrain the parameter s space .",
    "we perform our calculations within susy or sugra , whenever this is needed .    for f - term inflation ,",
    "the symmetry breaking scale @xmath3 associated with the inflaton mass scale ( and the strings scale ) is a slowly varying function of the superpotential coupling @xmath0 , and of the dimensionality @xmath336 of the representations to which the scalar components of the chiral higgs superfields belong . for so(10 ) , under the requirement that r - parity is conserved down to low energies , @xmath159 . for @xmath184 ,",
    "the higgs representations can be @xmath158 or @xmath160 .",
    "the dependence of a measurable quantity ( the cosmic strings contribution ) on this discrete parameter @xmath336 can provide an interesting tool to discriminate among different grand unified gauge groups .",
    "the unique free parameter of the model , the dimensionless coupling @xmath0 , should obey two constraints .",
    "namely , it should satisfy the gravitino constraint , and it should also obey to the cmb constraint .",
    "we found that the cmb constraint on the coupling @xmath0 is the strongest one : it imposes @xmath337 , for @xmath338 whereas the gravitino constraint reads @xmath339 .",
    "the wmap constraint on the superpotential coupling @xmath0 can be expressed into a constraint on the mass scale , namely @xmath340 gev .",
    "the value of the inflaton field is of the same order of magnitude , and since it is below the planck scale , it implies that global supersymmetry is sufficient for our analysis .",
    "thus , it is not necessary to take into account supergravity corrections .",
    "the implications of this finding are quite strong .",
    "supersymmetric hybrid inflation was advertised to circumvent the naturalness issue appearing in the most elegant nonsupersymmetric inflationary model , i.e. , chaotic inflation .",
    "namely , chaotic inflation needed a very small coupling ( @xmath341 ) .",
    "cosmology taught us that supersymmetric hybrid inflation also suffers from the fine tuning issue when embedded within the class of cosmological models considered here .    in this study",
    "we also employed a mechanism where this problem can be lifted .",
    "this is done if we use the curvaton mechanism . in this case",
    "another scalar field , called the curvaton , could generate the initial density perturbations whereas the inflaton field is only responsible for the dynamics of the universe . within supersymmetric theories such scalar fields",
    "are expected to exist . in this case , the coupling @xmath0 is only constrained by the gravitino limit .",
    "we performed the same analysis for d - term inflation . in this case",
    "we found that the value of the inflaton field is of the order of the planck scale or higher .",
    "one should therefore consider local supersymmetry , taking into account all the one - loop radiative corrections . to our knowledge , this was never considered in previous studies .",
    "our analysis gives a nonconstant contribution of cosmic strings to the cmb temperature anisotropies , which is strongly dependent on the gauge coupling @xmath5 and the superpotential @xmath6 .",
    "we claim that the d - term inflationary model is still an open possibility , since it does not always imply that the cosmic strings contribution to the cmb is above the upper limit allowed by wmap . to avoid contradiction with the data ,",
    "the free parameters of the model are strongly constrained .",
    "more precisely , we found that the gauge coupling must satisfy the constraint @xmath342 , and the superpotential coupling must obey the condition @xmath343 .",
    "this is the same limit as the one found in the susy framework .",
    "the supergravity corrections also give a lower limit on the value of this parameter . as an example , for @xmath308 we found @xmath344 .",
    "this allowed window for @xmath6 shrinks as @xmath5 goes from @xmath308 to @xmath328 .",
    "the conditions imposed by the cmb data on the couplings @xmath345 can be expressed as a single constraint on the fayet - iliopoulos term @xmath9 , namely @xmath346 , which remains valid independently of @xmath5 .    to conclude",
    ", we would like to emphasise that cosmic strings of the gut scale are in agreement with observationnal data and can play a rle in cosmology .",
    "cmb data do not rule out cosmic strings ; they impose strong constraints on their possible contribution .",
    "one should use these constraints to test high energy physics such as supersymmetric grand unified theories .",
    "this is indeed the philosophy of our paper .",
