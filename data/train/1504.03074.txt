    "differential equations have a great variety of applications in different fields of science such as engineering , physics , biology , pharmacokinetics ( @xcite ) . yet , there are only a few of their applications in economics or finance . particularly , well - known models involving differential equations are only economic growth model and black - scholes equation . the latter one will be discussed in the paper . in 1977 , myron scholes together with fischer black were awarded a nobel prize in economics for the formulation of stock options formula through `` new method of determining the value of derivative '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "so , black - scholes model deals with one of the most important issues in quantitative finance pricing of options ( @xcite ) .",
    "this model has significant implications both theoretical and practical since finance plays a great role in economies around the world ( @xcite ) .",
    "in practice , black - scholes model of option pricing was applied to various `` commodities and payoff structures '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "black - scholes model is widely used for american options as well as for european options .",
    "therefore , the model has a wide variety of applications . before considering black - scholes model",
    ", there is a number of assumptions that should be made .",
    "fischer black calls them `` ideal condition '' of the market ( @xcite ) .",
    "these assumptions are important to emphasize because it is well - known that stock markets are often volatile compared to other parts of the economy .",
    "there are five underlying assumptions :    1 .",
    "first assumption that should be made is information about values of short - term rates is available and short - term interest rates are constant ( @xcite ) .",
    "2 .   secondly , stock pays no dividend ( @xcite ) .",
    "thirdly , transaction costs that occur while buying or selling securities are eliminated ( @xcite ) .",
    "fourthly , it is achievable to borrow fraction of price of stock one wants in order to hold the stock ( @xcite ) .",
    "the last assumption states that short selling of a security in necessary situations is allowed in the market ( @xcite ) .",
    "thanks to these assumptions , option price will be the function of the time period and stock price only . in the following paragraphs",
    ", option price will be reduced to the function of stock price only for simplicity .",
    "generally , option values increase when stock prices rise . a positive relationship between option value and stock price may be easily seen from the following graph ( @xcite ) .",
    "as it can be seen from the figure , graphs representing the relationship between the option price and stock price at different time periods ( @xmath0 ) lie below 45-degree line , which shows that option prices are more volatile than the stock prices ( @xcite ) .",
    "the volatility of option prices lead to the following statement : if the price of the stock increases by a certain amount , greater percentage change will be generated in option prices .",
    "the graph illustrated below shows what the paper seeks to explain through black - scholes model .",
    "black - scholes equation is given by the following expression : @xmath1 where @xmath2 price of option , @xmath3 price of the stock , @xmath4 = period of time , @xmath5 = interest rate ( @xcite ) .",
    "firstly , it is useful to transform this partial differential equation ( pde ) into an ordinary differential equation ( ode ) by proposing the following solution : @xmath6 .",
    "given that @xmath7 and @xmath8 , by substituting these equations into the pde we get : @xmath9 the next step is to rearrange the equation to get second order ode : @xmath10 = 0.\\ ] ] the latter expression can be reduced to the following equation : @xmath11 since @xmath12 .",
    "to get rid of the coefficient of the first term lets divide everything by 1/2@xmath13 : @xmath14 this equation reminds us the euler equation : @xmath15 with real constants @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( @xcite ) . in our case , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which are positive constants .",
    "euler equation has the solution of the form @xmath20 in case of distinct real roots , and characteristic equation of the form : @xmath21 ( @xcite ) .      by the assumption given ,",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath5 are positive real numbers because @xmath5 is an interest rate and @xmath22 is volatility of the stock as noted earlier in the paper . now",
    ", a solution in the form of @xmath23 can be proposed and applied to the black - scholes equation .",
    "the following derivations will be useful in solving our problem : @xmath24 substituting the derivations back into the earlier equation we get : @xmath25 the next step is to take @xmath26 out of bracket and derive characteristic equation introduced earlier : @xmath27 = 0.\\ ] ]    @xmath28    to find the roots of characteristic equation , let us find discriminant : @xmath29 by assumption .",
    "so , the two distinct roots of characteristic equation will be : @xmath30 therefore , the solution of our problem can be written as : @xmath31 the solution represents option value as a function of stock prices . by the assumption @xmath32 and @xmath33 must be positive constants because of a positive relationship between option price and the stock price introduced earlier .",
    "the figure [ f ] above shows fluctuations in stock prices from 2000 to 2009 time period .",
    "the black - scholes presented in the paper is useful to explain , predict and estimate option prices based on stock prices in the financial world .",
    "black - scholes model gives more accurate estimates of option prices than other earlier developed models because it takes into account such factors influencing the stock prices as transaction costs , riskiness of assets , illiquid markets ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the model is used to estimate european call options , which consolidates its role in applied economics ( @xcite ) .",
    "black - scholes model focuses on option or security that is held for a certain period of time and gives the owner right to make market operations such as buying and selling .",
    "two types of securities can be specified : american options and european options ( @xcite ) .",
    "the difference of american options from european options is its quality that allows the owner to buy or sell the security until the maturity date , whereas the latter one does not allow conducting market operations until the security matures .",
    "according to empirical tests made by black and scholes , estimated option values deviate slightly from what they are in practice . although those who demand stocks and bonds pay higher ( to a small degree ) prices for the products in securities markets , suppliers receive payments fairly close to what the formula calculates ( @xcite ) .",
    "this gap occurring between prices paid and received by demanders and suppliers may be understood by transaction costs @xmath34 costs associated with exchanges @xmath34 which occur as a result of a variety of services in an industry .",
    "there are two types of options that can be specified:``american option '' and `` european option '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "american options are the ones that are checkable on demand , particularly they can be returned before the maturity date . whereas european options are the ones that can be returned only on a specific date , when they mature .",
    "so , american options are more liquid than european options .",
    "as noted earlier , an option is more valuable when the stock price is higher ( @xcite ) .",
    "also , option depends on the maturity date , particularly the date of expiration .",
    "if maturity date is over a long period of time , then payments , particularly dividends that are paid on specific periods of time for the option will be less",
    ". on the other hand , if maturity date is during a short period of time , then dividends are higher .",
    "since black - scholes equation is a theoretical prediction of stock movements in the market , there are some restrictions that should be noted . beside theory",
    ", there is a real world in which conditions in the stock market may not be that ideal as predicted by the model . also , the reason theoretical models are built in finance and economics is that it is difficult to test or do an experiment with the real world .",
    "for example , in physics the experiments can be done inside the laboratories as well as in chemistry . however , experimenting with financial economics situations imposes high costs as they are closely connected with markets , which exist in our real world .",
    "so , making an experiment with the financial markets is difficult because of globality of problems .",
    "the only information for conducting policies or solving problems in finance is past data collection .",
    "data in the past is similar with a tool that helps to understand general patterns of markets , movements of asset prices , behaviors of economic agents , relationships and co - movements of financial variables . with data collected in the past ,",
    "it is possible to draw graphs relating the economic variables , showing their trends and movements .",
    "also , data helps to predict future trend in markets , however only roughly .",
    "now as we understand the importance of theoretical models , there are some conditions that should be specified regarding the black - scholes model .",
    "this is a complete list of assumptions additional to that noted earlier in the paper :    1 .",
    "there are perfect information about short - term interest rates and their movements are constant over long period of time ( @xcite ) .",
    "2 .   movement of stock prices is random and its variance is proportional to the square of stock prices ; therefore distribution of stock prices is lognormal over some finite period @xmath4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "3 .   unlike the real world , where stocks pay dividends to the shareholders , in the model stocks do not pay any payments ( @xcite ) .",
    "4 .   only european options are to be considered in the model , so they are returned on a maturity date ( @xcite ) .",
    "5 .   unlike in financial markets where transaction costs exist in all operations",
    ", it is assumed that buying or selling stocks do not impose any transaction costs ( @xcite ) .",
    "any fraction of the price of security can be borrowed at short @xmath34 term interest rate ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is a possibility of short selling with no penalty or any costs .",
    "a seller will accept the price that buyer tells , agrees to meet at some specific time in the future , and pay the amount equal to that of the security price ( @xcite ) .    due to these assumptions ,",
    "option value will depend only on time and stock price ; and other variables are taken to be constant so as to simplify our model ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the value of the option @xmath35 reduces to the following simple function : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the price of the stock and @xmath4 is the period of time ( @xcite ) .",
    "the expression above tells us how the value of the option changes if one of the variables , price of the stock or period of time , changes .",
    "the assumption that stocks pay no dividends gives an advantage of getting to more complicated problems with options .",
    "one example is under certain conditions , the formula can be applied to american options , which can be issued before maturity date ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite studied this particular case in 1973 .",
    "the black - scholes equation helps to calculate not only option value , but also more complicated assets such as warrants , which are liabilities of corporations ( @xcite ) .",
    "warrants are generally considered as options .",
    "also , the value of corporate liabilities may be calculated via the formula .",
    "often corporate liabilities are not viewed as options .",
    "we may consider a case of a company , which has assets of shares of another company ( @xcite ) .",
    "also , bonds are `` pure discount bonds '' , which indicates a bond pays fixed amount of money ( @xcite ) .",
    "assume maturity of 10 years .",
    "also , assume that a company has a restriction of paying no dividend until the maturity date .",
    "then , assume the company is planning to sell all of its stocks after 10 years and pay the amount for holders of bonds ( @xcite ) .",
    "so , these certain conditions let us to calculate a value of corporate liabilities using black - scholes equation as the assumptions make corporate liabilities similar to options .",
    "this part of our paper will greatly consist of the material from the book by @xcite . also note that @xcite focus on numerical solution of nonlinear black - scholes equation using finite element method .",
    "let us construct a differential equation that will help us to describe the evolution of @xmath38 the following hypotheses are established :    * @xmath39 follows a lognormal law ; * the volatility @xmath22 is constant and known ; * there are no transaction costs or dividends ; * it is possible to buy or sell any number of the underlying asset ; * there is an interest rate @xmath40 , for a riskless investment .",
    "this means that 1-dollar in a bank at time @xmath41 becomes @xmath42 dollars at time @xmath43 ; * the market is arbitrage free .",
    "the last hypothesis is crucial in the construction of the model and means that there is no opportunity for instantaneous risk - free profit .",
    "it could be considered as a sort of conservation law for money !",
    "we can translate this principle into mathematical terms through the notion of hedging and the existence of self - financing portfolios .",
    "the fundamental idea is to calculate the return of @xmath44 through formula and then to build a riskless portfolio @xmath45 .",
    "this portfolio contains shares of @xmath39 and the option .",
    "@xmath45 must increase at the current interest rate @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath46 , which turns out to coincide with the fundamental black - scholes equation .",
    "now let us move to the calculation of the differential of @xmath44 through the means of the formula .",
    "since @xmath47 the obtained result is @xmath48 dt+\\sigma sv_sdb.\\ ] ]    in the formula ( [ 1 ] ) we have risk term @xmath49 .",
    "so , our next goal will be an elimination of this term .",
    "this can be acquired by establishing a portfolio @xmath45 consisting of the option and a quantity @xmath50 of underlying : @xmath51 this operation is valuable financial procedure called hedging .",
    "now , let us turn out attention to the particular period of time , say @xmath52 during which @xmath45 goes through a variation @xmath53 .",
    "if we succeed in keeping @xmath54 equal to its value at @xmath4 during the interval @xmath52 , the variation of @xmath45 is given by @xmath55 since the mentioned formula is a cornerstone of the whole construction , it should be explained properly .",
    "implementing @xmath56 the we acquire : @xmath57dt + \\sigma s(v_s - \\triangle)db.\\ ] ] thus , if we choose @xmath58 where @xmath54 is the value of @xmath59 at @xmath4 , we eliminate the stochastic component in ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "the development of the portfolio @xmath45 is now deterministic and its dynamics can be described by the equation : @xmath60dt.\\ ] ] the choice of ( [ 3 ] ) seems inexplicable , but it can be justified by the fact that @xmath44 and @xmath39 are dependent and the random component in their dynamics is proportional to @xmath39 .",
    "thus , we the linear combination of @xmath44 and @xmath39 is chosen wisely , such component should vanish .",
    "now let us implement the no - arbitrage principle .",
    "investing @xmath45 at the riskless rate @xmath5 , after a time @xmath61 we have an increment @xmath62 .",
    "comparison between @xmath62 and @xmath53 is given by ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath63 , we borrow an amount @xmath45 to invest in the portfolio .",
    "the return @xmath53 would be greater of the cost @xmath62 , so that we make an instantaneous riskless profit @xmath64 if @xmath65 , we sell the portfolio @xmath45 investing it in a bank at the rate @xmath5 . this time we would make an instantaneous risk free profit @xmath66 therefore , the arbitrage free hypothesis forces @xmath67dt = r\\pi dt .\\ ] ] substituting @xmath68 into ( [ 5 ] ) , we obtain famous black - scholes equation : @xmath69 since the coefficient of @xmath70 is positive , ( [ 6 ] ) is a backward equation . in order to get well - posed problem",
    ", we need to impose final condition ( at @xmath71 ) , a side condition at @xmath72 and one condition for @xmath73 .",
    "* final conditions @xmath74 + call .",
    "if at time @xmath43 we have @xmath75 then we exercise the option , with a profit @xmath76 .",
    "if @xmath77 , we do not exercise the option with no profit .",
    "the _ final payoff _ of the option is therefore @xmath78 = ( s - e)^+ , s>0.\\ ] ] + put . if at time @xmath43 we have @xmath77 , we do not exercise the option , while we exercise the option if @xmath79 .",

    "if at a certain time is @xmath81 , so that @xmath84 thereafter , the final profit is @xmath85 .",
    "thus , to determine @xmath86 we need to determine the present value of @xmath85 at time @xmath43 , that is @xmath87 + if @xmath73 , we do not exercise the option , hence @xmath88    _ solution of the black - scholes equation _",
    "let us summarize our model in the two cases .    * black - scholes equation @xmath89 * final payoffs @xmath90 @xmath91 * boundary conditions @xmath92",
    "@xmath93    the problem above can be simplified to a global cauchy problem for the heat equation .",
    "thus , the explicit formulas for the solutions can be obtained .",
    "firstly , a change of variables should be performed so as to reduce the black - scholes equation to constant coefficients and to pass from backward to forward in time . note also that @xmath94 can be considered an intrinsic reference time while the exercise price @xmath85 gives a characteristic order of magnitude for @xmath39 and @xmath44 .",
    "thus , @xmath94 and @xmath85 can be used as rescaling factors to introduce a dimensionless variable .",
    "let us set @xmath95 when @xmath39 goes from @xmath96 to @xmath97 , @xmath37 varies from @xmath98 to @xmath99 . when @xmath100 we have @xmath101 .",
    "moreover : @xmath102 @xmath103 if we put this into ( [ bs ] ) we will end up with the following : @xmath104 or @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a parameter with no dimension .",
    "if we set @xmath107 we find that @xmath108 satisfies @xmath109    it is worth mentioning that the final condition for @xmath44 is an initial condition for @xmath108 . performing following several steps we find out that @xmath110 for the call option , and @xmath111 for the put option .",
    "now we can use the preceding results to derive the formula of the solution .",
    "the solution is unique and it is given by formula @xmath112 to have a more general formula , let @xmath113 .",
    "then , focusing on the call option : @xmath114.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after modifying those two integrals , we get @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the distribution of a standard normal random variable and @xmath117 returning to the original variables , for the call we have : @xmath118 with @xmath119 the formula for the put is @xmath120    it can be shown that @xmath121 @xmath122 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we should pay particular attention to the fact that both @xmath123 and @xmath124 are strictly increasing with respect to @xmath39 .",
    "thus , the functions @xmath125 are strictly convex functions of @xmath39 , for every @xmath4 , namely @xmath126 and @xmath127 .    * put - call parity . put and call options with the same exercise price and expiry time can be connected by forming the following portfolio :    @xmath128 where the minus in front of @xmath129 shows _ short position _",
    "( negative holding ) . for this portfolio",
    "the final payoff is @xmath130    if @xmath131 , we have @xmath132 while if @xmath133 @xmath134 therefore , at expiry , the payoff is always equal to @xmath85 and it forms a riskless profit , whose value at @xmath4 must be equal to the discounted value of @xmath85 , since the no - arbitrage condition was imposed .",
    "so , we find the subsequent relation ( _ put - call parity _ ) @xmath135 formula ( [ pc ] ) reveals that , with the value of @xmath129 ( or @xmath136 ) available , the value of @xmath136 ( or @xmath129 ) can be obtained . from ( [ pc ] ) , since @xmath137 and @xmath138 , we get @xmath139 and since @xmath140 @xmath141 it can be observed that the value of @xmath129 is always greater than the final payoff .",
    "however , this property does not hold for a put .",
    "in fact , @xmath142 so the value of @xmath136 is less than the final payoff when @xmath39 approaches @xmath96 , and it is greater just before expiring .",
    "the figures [ ec ] and [ ep ] demonstrate that .",
    "* different volatilities .",
    "the comparison between the value of two options with the different volatilities @xmath143 and @xmath144 can be conducted through the means of the maximum principle .",
    "let us assume that the exercise price and strike time are the same for the both cases , @xmath85 being the exercise price and @xmath145 strike time .",
    "another assumption that we allow is that @xmath146 .",
    "denote the values of the respective call options @xmath147 . with decreasing amount of risk the value of the option should decline as well .",
    "what we want to show is that    @xmath148 let @xmath149 . then @xmath150 with @xmath151 and @xmath152 as @xmath153 it is obvious that ( [ w ] ) is a nonhomogeneous equation , with the right hand side being negative for @xmath154 , since @xmath155 .",
    "we know that @xmath156 is continuous in the half strip @xmath157 $ ] and disappears at infinity , it reaches its global minimum at @xmath158 .",
    "we claim that the minimum is zero and can not be obtained at a point in the intervals @xmath159 .",
    "the equation is backward , so @xmath160 is not considered .",
    "assume that @xmath161 with @xmath162 and @xmath163 thus , @xmath164 and @xmath165 substituting @xmath166 into ( [ w ] ) we observe a contradiction .",
    "thus , @xmath167 for @xmath168 .    in 1972 ,",
    "empirical tests on call - options by fischer black and myron scholes were done ( @xcite).the results of the tests show that actual prices at which agents of the economy buy and sell options deviate systematically from the prices predicted by the black- scholes model ( @xcite ) .",
    "options are bought at consecutively higher prices from those predicted by the model , whereas options are sold approximately at the prices predicted by the model ( @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that the difference in prices paid by option buyers are higher for lower - risk stocks than for higher - risk stocks ( @xcite ) .",
    "the latter point makes sense because low - risk stocks are always preferable than high - risk stocks since the probability that low - risk stocks generate large profits and do not default are higher . for option buyers ,",
    "there are high transaction costs involved in the real world .",
    "this fact might explain why formula underestimates the price paid by option buyers because the model is built under assumption of no transaction costs . according to @xcite , getting into account the magnitude of the transaction costs in the market , misestimation of the prices",
    "does not indicate potential profit opportunities for speculators in the market .",
    "this section considers the partial black - scholes equation of the form @xmath169 the aim of the section is to introduce separation of variables method in order to solve the equation and find the general solution .",
    "let the function @xmath170 to be written in the following form : @xmath171 then , the following partial derivatives can be derived : @xmath172 @xmath173 @xmath174 substituting the derivatives back to the original equation , we get : @xmath175 for simplicity , let @xmath176 and @xmath177 for now . dividing the equation by @xmath178 @xmath179 rearranging and equating to a constant ( @xmath180 ) ,",
