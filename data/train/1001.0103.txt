    "the origin of the extragalactic diffuse gamma - ray background ( egrb ) is a long - standing puzzle .",
    "first discovered by the _ sas 2 _ satellite @xcite , its existence was subsequently confirmed up to @xmath0 50 gev by egret ( energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ) on board the compton gamma ray observatory .",
    "egret measured a flux of about @xmath2 10@xmath3 photons @xmath4 s@xmath5 sr@xmath5 above 100 mev and an approximately power - law spectrum with photon index of @xmath6 over the wide range of 30 mev  50 gev @xcite . very recently ,",
    "@xcite reported _ fermi _ observations of the egrb spectrum up to 100 gev , which connects smoothly to the egret results below @xmath0 200 mev @xcite .",
    "however , above this energy , the spectrum is discrepant from egret , being a single power - law with index @xmath7 , and showing no signs of a gev excess .    although different types of gamma - ray sources ( e.g. , clusters of galaxies or dark matter annihilation ) have been proposed to be significant contributors to the egrb [ see , e.g. , ref . @xcite and references therein ] , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) of the blazar class",
    "are considered the primary candidates , since almost all of the extragalactic sources detected by egret were blazars . the blazar contribution to the egrb",
    "has been estimated by numerous authors , who have reached different conclusions using different approaches , ranging from 20% to 100 % of the observed flux @xcite .    in most past studies , the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the blazars were assumed to be power laws for all objects . in such models , it is obvious that the predicted egrb spectrum is mainly determined by the assumed power - law indices .",
    "however , multi - wavelength observational studies indicate the existence of a non - trivial trend among blazar seds : the energies of the two characteristic spectral peaks in blazar seds ( each likely reflecting the synchrotron and inverse compton emission ) systematically decrease as the bolometric luminosity increases @xcite .",
    "this is often referred to as the blazar sed sequence .",
    "although its validity is currently still a matter of debate ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , one can make a non - trivial prediction of the egrb spectrum if this blazar sequence is assumed .",
    "here we compare the latest _ fermi _ egrb results with our model predictions , previously published in ref .",
    "@xcite ( it09 ) before the former was announced .",
    "it09 calculated the egrb from blazars by constructing a blazar gamma - ray luminosity function ( glf ) model that is consistent with the flux and redshift distributions of the egret blazars , accounting for the blazar sequence as well as the luminosity - dependent density evolution ( ldde ) scheme that describes well the evolution of the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) of agns . by introducing the blazar sed sequence , we were able to make a reasonable and non - trivial prediction of the egrb spectrum that can be compared with observations including the new _ fermi _ data .",
    "recently , ref .",
    "@xcite has shown that the egrb in the mev band can be naturally explained by normal ( i.e. , non - blazar ) agns that compose the cosmic x - ray background .",
    "if so , they should also contribute to the egrb at @xmath8 1 gev .",
    "we will investigate what fraction of the observed egrb can be explained by the sum of the blazar and non - blazar agn components .",
    "the contribution of blazars to the egrb in the mev band is also discussed and compared with a recent study on the possible relevance of the so - called `` mev blazars '' @xcite .",
    "we will then make quantitative predictions for the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope @xcite for its five - year survey .",
    "the first _ fermi _ catalog for bright gamma - ray sources including agns has recently been released @xcite .",
    "the number of currently detected blazars is about 100 , larger than that of egret by a modest factor of about 2 .",
    "we limit the discussion of the blazar data to only the egret sample in this work , to be considered as a theoretical prediction from the pre-_fermi _ era . in the future",
    ", a much larger number of blazars should be detected with _",
    ", which can be compared further with our predictions .",
    "we also discuss the highest - redshift blazars detectable by _ fermi _ , by updating the it09 glf model with respect to high - redshift evolution .",
    "we briefly mention the possibility of utilizing such blazars to obtain information on the high - redshift extragalactic background light and early galaxy formation through spectral absorption features .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt the standard cosmological parameters of ( @xmath9)=(0.7,0.3,0.7 ) .",
    "49.50 , 48.64 , 47.67 , 46.37 , and 45.99 ( from top to bottom).,width=264 ]    ref . @xcite constructed an empirical blazar sed model to describe the sed sequence , based on fittings to observed seds from radio to @xmath10-ray bands .",
    "these models are comprised of the two components ( synchrotron and ic ) , and each of the two is described by a linear curve at low photon energies and a parabolic curve at high energies .",
    "we construct our own sed sequence model mainly based on the sed model @xcite , because there is a mathematical discontinuity in the original model of ref .",
    "our own sed sequence formula is described in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite in detail . in fig.[fig.sed",
    "] , we show this empirical blazar sed sequence model in comparison with the observed sed data @xcite .",
    "the cosmological evolution of agn xlf has been investigated intensively @xcite .",
    "these studies revealed that agn xlf is well described by the ldde model , in which peak redshift of density evolution increases with agn luminosity .",
    "here we construct blazar glf models based on the two xlfs derived by ref .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter u03 ; in hard x - ray band ) and ref . @xcite ( hereafter h05 ; in soft x - ray band ) .",
    "the use of ldde in blazar glf has been supported from the egret blazar data @xcite .",
    "we simply assume that the bolometric luminosity of radiation from jet , @xmath11 , is proportional to disk x - ray luminosity , @xmath12 .",
    "we relate these two by the parameter @xmath13 , as @xmath14 . here",
    ", we define the disk luminosity @xmath12 to be that in the rest - frame 210 and 0.52 kev bands for the u03 xlf and the h05 xlf , respectively .",
    "thus , the luminosity at rest 100 mev , @xmath15 , and @xmath12 have been related through @xmath11 .",
    "the blazar glf @xmath16 is then obtained from the agn xlf , @xmath17 , as @xmath18 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the comoving number densities per unit gamma - ray and x - ray luminosity , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 is a normalization factor , representing the fraction of agns observed as blazars .",
    "see the  3 in ref .",
    "@xcite for a detail .",
    "we use the maximum likelihood method to search for the best - fit model parameters of the blazar glf to the distributions of the observed quantities of the egret blazars ( gamma - ray flux and redshift ) .",
    "@xcite for a detail .",
    "we take @xmath13 and the faint - end slope index of xlf @xmath20 in addition to @xmath13 as free parameters .",
    "these are hereafter called as u03(@xmath13 ) , h05(@xmath13 ) , u03(@xmath13 , @xmath20 ) and h05(@xmath13 , @xmath20 ) fits , respectively .",

    "the glf predicts that about 750 and 1200 blazars should be detected by _",

    "@xcite , and the ple and ldde models @xcite predicted @xmath010000 , 5000 , and 3000 blazars for the 1-year sensitivity limit , respectively .",
    "it is remarkable that the glf models in this work predict significantly smaller numbers of blazars than most of previous studies .",
    "about 450 non - blazar agns would be detected by _",
    "fermi _ with 5-year survey , by their soft nonthermal emission from nonthermal electrons in coronae of accretion disks , giving an interesting test for our model .",
    "we estimated the @xmath21 100 mev gamma - ray flux from the observed hard x - ray flux of ngc 4151 ( the brightest seyfert galaxy in all sky @xcite ) using the itu08 model @xcite .",
    "then , ngc 4151 is marginally detectable when @xmath24 , and easily detectable with @xmath25 with one year survey sensitivity .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig.count ] shows the differential flux distribution of gamma - ray blazars and non - blazar agns multiplied by flux , showing the contribution to the egrb per unit logarithmic flux interval .",
    "egrb from blazars should practically be resolved into discrete sources .",
    "we find that the fraction of egrb flux that should be resolved is 98% against the total blazar egrb flux in 5-year survey . on the other hand , egrb from non - blazar agns",
    "is hardly resolved into discrete sources by _ fermi_. the predicted fraction of non - blazar egrb flux resolved by _",
    "fermi _ is @xmath00.01 % with 5-year survey , respectively , against the total non - blazar egrb flux .",
    "these results are in sharp contrast to those for blazars , although the contributions to the total egrb by the two populations are comparable at around 100 mev .",
    "the above results mean that a considerable part of egrb at around 100 mev will remain unresolved even with the _ fermi _ sensitivity , because there is a considerable contribution from non - blazar agns to egrb at @xmath0100 mev .",
    "however , the contribution from non - blazars should rapidly decrease with increasing photon energy , and almost all of the total egrb flux at @xmath26 1 gev should be resolved into discrete blazars by _ fermi _ , if there is no significant source contributing to egrb other than blazars .",
    "it should be noted that these predictions can be tested by _",
    "relatively easily , without follow - up or cross check at other wavebands , once measurements of source counts and egrb flux have been done by the _ fermi _ data . therefore this gives a simple and clear test for our theoretical model @xcite .",

    "solid and dashed curves correspond to whether or not sdss quasar constraints are taken into account.,width=264 ]    since _ fermi _ is the most sensitive gev gamma - ray observatory to date , it has the potential to discover many new high - redshift blazars .",
    "gev photons from high - redshift sources are expected to suffer intergalactic absorption due to @xmath29 pair production interactions with the cosmic uv background radiation .",
    "the resulting features in the spectra of such blazars could therefore be a key probe of the poorly - understood uv background radiation and provide valuable insight into the cosmic dark ages @xcite .",
    "the high - redshift evolution of the glf is uncertain , as there are no appropriate samples of gamma - ray blazars and x - ray agns above @xmath30 .",
    "thus we constructed new glfs by combining the u03 xlf with evolutionary constraints from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) quasar luminosity function data @xcite .",
    "the sdss quasar luminosity function is well constrained up to @xmath31 .",

    "note that intergalactic absorption effects are not included here , as they are not expected to be important below 1 gev @xcite .",
    "the results imply that _ fermi _ may detect some blazars up to @xmath1 during the five - year survey .",
    "measurements of the spectra of such blazars above 1 gev through subsequent , deep observations should provide interesting constraints on the high - z uv background .",
    "more details will be presented in a forthcoming publication .",
    "we have compared our prediction of the egrb spectrum @xcite with the recent _ fermi _ data , and made quantitative predictions for the next four years of the _ fermi _ mission .",
    "@xcite , we constructed a model of the blazar gamma - ray luminosity function ( glf ) , taking into account the blazar sed sequence and the ldde luminosity function inferred from x - ray observations of agns .",
    "the glf model parameters are constrained by fitting to the observed flux and redshift distribution of the egret blazars . with this model",
    ", we can predict the egrb spectrum in a non - trivial way , rather than assuming simple power - law spectra .",
    "the contribution from non - blazar agns to the egrb is also considered , using the nonthermal coronal electron model @xcite .",
    "this model gives a natural explanation for the observed cosmic mev background , and we examined whether the x - ray to gev gamma - ray background radiation can be accounted for by the two population model including blazars and non - blazar agns .",
    "our predicted blazar egrb spectrum matched very well with the latest _ fermi _ egrb data .",
    "this indicates that blazars are the dominant population of the egrb and that other components such as dark matter annihilation do not contribute to egrb significantly .",
    "this also indicates that the use of blazar sed sequence was valid .",
    "the predicted spectrum including blazars and non - blazar agns is also in good agreement with the observed data from x - ray to 100 gev .",
    "therefore , blazars and non - blazar agns are likely the primary sources of the cosmic x - ray and gamma - ray background radiation .",
    "our model predicts that it is possible to account for 80 % of the observed egrb flux above 100 mev with the sum of the blazar and non - blazar agn components , where blazars alone account for about 45 % .",
    "the two components are comparable at @xmath0100 mev , with blazars and non - blazar agns dominating at higher and lower energies , respectively .    from the viewpoint of the egrb spectrum from mev to gev",
    ", we argue that the dominant component contributing to the mev background is non - blazar agns that are also responsible also for the cxb , rather than mev blazars as proposed by ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we predicted the flux distribution of blazars by our model , and we found that 750 and 1200 blazars in all sky should be detected by _",
    "fermi _ , assuming a sensitivity limit of @xmath32 and @xmath23 photons @xmath4 s@xmath5 above 100 mev corresponding to one and five year survey sensitivity .",
    "this number is significantly lower than the predictions by many of the previous studies . about 450 of non - blazar agns",
    "are expected to be detected by _ fermi _ with 5-year survey .",
    "_ fermi _ should resolve almost all of the egrb flux from blazars into discrete blazars , with percentages of @xmath2698% with 5-year survey . on the other hand , less than 0.1% of the egrb flux from non - blazar agns can be resolved into discrete sources .",
    "therefore , we have a clear prediction : _ fermi _ will resolve almost all of the egrb flux into discrete sources at photon energies @xmath33 gev where blazars are dominant , while a significant fraction of the egrb flux will remain unresolved in the low energy band of @xmath8 100 mev where non - blazar agns have a significant contribution .",
    "this prediction can easily be tested , only with the source counts and the egrb estimates by _ fermi _ data .",
    "we also made predictions for future detections of high - redshift blazars . since the glf is uncertain at @xmath34 due to lack of direct observational data , we constrained the redshift evolution of our original agn xlf using sdss quasar data . with this assumption",
    ", we find that _ fermi _ may find some blazars up to @xmath1 during the five year survey .",
    "such high - redshift gev blazars will offer a new probe of the formation histories of early stars and galaxies via gev spectral attenuation signatures caused by the high - redshift uv background radiation .",
