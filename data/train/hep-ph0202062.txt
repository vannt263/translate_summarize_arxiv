    "in the context of ckm phenomenology several important developments have taken place in the last decade .",
    "on the one hand , there is considerable refinement in the data pertaining to ckm parameters , on the other hand several phenomenological inputs have also refined the ckm elements further . however , despite a good deal of knowledge of ckm matrix elements , the cp violation still remains one of the least tested aspect of the ckm paradigm . in this context , an intense amount of experimental activity is being carried out in a variety of experiments at b - factories , kek - b , slac - b , hera - b and will be carried out at lhc - b and b - tev , both of which will become operational by 2006 .",
    "the main goal of the current phase of experiments will be to observe cp violation in the b system .",
    "it is expected that the data provided by these factories would throw new lights on the cp violating b decays , in particular it will lead to the construction of unitarity triangle involving first and third columns of the ckm matrix .    in this context , the recent flurry of activity created by the preliminary babar @xcite and belle @xcite results regarding the time dependent cp asymmetry @xmath22 in @xmath23 , has given lot of impetus to the study of ckm phenomenology .",
    "not withstanding the agreement of the latest babar results @xcite with the sm ( standard model ) @xcite-@xcite , the activity generated by their preliminary results has thrown open several interesting possibilities of discovering new physics beyond the sm . in this context , it has also been emphasized by several authors in their recent works @xcite-@xcite that there could be new physics in the loop dominated processes such as @xmath0 mixing and @xmath1 mixing , as well as in some of the cp violating amplitudes .    in view of the possibility of signals of new physics in @xmath0 mixing and @xmath1 mixing , it is desirable to sharpen their implications on the ckm parameters , particularly on the cp violating phase   as well as on the angles   of the much talked about unitarity triangle . in this context , in the last few years some very detailed and extensive analyses of ckm phenomenology @xcite-@xcite have been carried out .",
    "these analyses primarily concentrate on finding ckm parameters in the wolfenstein representation @xcite and the angles of unitarity triangle . apart from unitarity ,",
    "usual inputs for such analyses are cp violating parameter @xmath24 as well as the mass difference , @xmath25 , between the light and heavy mass eigenstates of the @xmath26 system .",
    "a careful perusal of these analyses indicates that these do not adequately emphasize the evaluation of jarlskog s rephasing invariant parameter j @xcite , a key quantity measuring the cp violating effects , as well as these do not investigate independently the implications of unitarity , @xmath24 ,   and   respectively .",
    "to closely scrutinize the effects of unitarity , @xmath0 and @xmath1 mixing on the ckm parameters , one should study their implications separately .",
    "we believe , this would facilitate deciphering the signals of new physics in the loop dominated cp violating amplitudes in the k as well as b mesons .",
    "recently randhawa _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , have studied in detail the implications of unitarity on j and on the cp violating phase , as well as a `` reference triangle '' has been constructed purely from the considerations of unitarity of the ckm matrix . the purpose of the present communication is to extend the analysis carried in references @xcite by including independently the implications of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mixing , along with the unitarity on the ckm parameters .",
    "besides comparing our results with one of the most recent analyses @xcite , we also intend to study the effect of the future refinements in the data .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . to facilitate the discussion as well as to make the mss .",
    "readable , in section 2 we detail the essentials of the unitarity based analysis carried out in reference @xcite . in the section 3 ,",
    "we determine the ckm phase   from unitarity and the @xmath0 mixing parameter   and then use it to evaluate ckm matrix elements and the angles   of the ckm triangle . similarly , in the section 4 we evaluate above mentioned ckm parameters using unitarity and the mass differences   and . in section 5 , we discuss our results obtained after incorporating all the constraints , for example , unitarity ,   and , simultaneously . a comparison of our results with those of buras @xcite is also included in this section .",
    "the implications of the future refinements in the data have been discussed in section 6 .",
    "finally , section 7 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "unitarity of the ckm matrix implies nine relations , three are diagonal and the six non - diagonal relations can be expressed through the six unitarity triangles in the complex plane , for example , uc & & v_udv_cd^ * + v_usv_cs^ * + v_ubv_cb^ *   =   0 , [ uc ] + db & & v_udv_ub^ * + v_cdv_cb^ * + v_tdv_tb^ *   =   0 , [ db ] + ds & & v_udv_us^ * + v_cdv_cs^ * + v_tdv_ts^ *   =  0 , [ ds ] + sb & & v_usv_ub^ * + v_csv_cb^ * + v_tsv_tb^ *   =   0 , [ sb ] + ut & & v_udv_td^ * + v_usv_ts^ * + v_ubv_tb^ *   =   0 , [ ut ] + ct & & v_cdv_td^ * + v_csv_ts^ * + v_cbv_tb^ *   =   0 , [ ct ] where the letters @xmath27 etc .",

    "the areas of all the six triangles ( equations [ uc]-[ct ] ) are equal and the area of any of the unitarity triangle is related to jarlskog s rephasing invariant parameter j as = 2 [ area ] in principle , j can be evaluated by using above relation through any of the six unitarity triangles , however in practice there are problems associated with the evaluation of area of the triangles . apart from triangle @xmath28 , all other triangles involve elements involving @xmath29 quark , which are not experimentally measured as yet .",
    "apparently , it seems that the triangle @xmath28 is ideal for evaluating j as it involves the elements known with fair degree of accuracy .",
    "however , on a closer look one finds that @xmath28 is a highly squashed triangle , for example , the sides @xmath30 and @xmath31 are of comparable lengths while the third side @xmath32 is several orders of magnitude smaller compared to the other two , hence it is not easy to evaluate its area unambiguously . assuming the existence of cp violation through the ckm mechanism , in reference @xcite we have detailed the procedure for evaluation of j through triangle @xmath28 . using the experimental values of ckm matrix elements , listed in the table [ tabinput ]",
    ", we obtain = ( 2.59 0.79 ) 10 ^ -5 [ jpdg1s ] .    in view of the fact that the triangle is highly squashed , therefore to ascertain whether j given by equation [ jpdg1s ] faithfully incorporates the constraints of unitarity",
    ", it is very much desirable to compare our results in this regard with those of pdg @xcite , who have also calculated ckm matrix by incorporating unitarity and experimental data pertaining to , , , ,   and . in the context of pdg ckm matrix",
    ", it may be noted that once ckm elements are known , one can calculate j corresponding to any of the six triangles , however the two unsquashed triangles @xmath33 and @xmath34 provide the best opportunity in this regard .",

    "[ del2 ] this value of @xmath2 apparently looks to be the consequence only of the unitarity relationship given by equation [ uc ] .",
    "however , on further investigations , as shown by branco and lavoura @xcite , one finds that this @xmath2 range is a consequence of all the non trivial unitarity constraints . in this sense , the above range could be attributed to the unitarity of the ckm matrix .",
    "having found @xmath2 , it is desirable to examine whether its above range and the mixing angles @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , as calculated from the experimental values of ,   and , are able to reproduce the ckm matrix given by pdg .",
