    "<S> the sodium cobaltate family ( @xmath0 ) is unique among transition metal oxides because the co sits on a triangular lattice and its valence can be tuned over a wide range by varying the na concentration @xmath1 . up to now detailed modeling of the rich phenomenology ( which ranges from unconventional superconductivity to enhanced thermopower ) </S>",
    "<S> has been hampered by the difficulty of controlling pure phases . </S>",
    "<S> we discovered that certain na concentrations are specially stable and are associated with superlattice ordering of the na clusters . </S>",
    "<S> this leads naturally to a picture of co - existence of localized spins and itinerant charge carriers . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath2 we found a remarkably small fermi energy of 87  k. our picture brings coherence to a variety of measurements ranging from optical to thermal transport . </S>",
    "<S> our results also allow us to take the first step towards modeling the mysterious `` curie - weiss '' metal state at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest the local moments may form a quantum spin liquid state and we propose experimental test of our hypothesis .    </S>",
    "<S> sodium cobaltate ( @xmath0 ) has received a great deal of attention from the condensed matter physics and materials science communities recently because the cobalt valence can be tuned over a great range by varying the na concentration , leading to unusual properties all the way from unconventional superconductivity when hydrated@xcite at @xmath4 to a novel `` curie - weiss metal''@xcite for @xmath5 to enhanced thermopower@xcite for @xmath6 . here </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate on @xmath7 where unusual magnetism@xcite has been observed and the ordering of the na ions is thought to play an important role.@xcite through electrochemical de - intercalation and a careful characterization of the na concentration on high purity single crystals , we determine that there is a special island of stability at @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we also studied @xmath9 which is the limit of single phase stability for high temperature melt growth . using x - ray and electron diffraction , we determine that these two phases exhibit special na ordering patterns . </S>",
    "<S> we discovered a hexagonal @xmath10 superstructure for @xmath11 , leading naturally to a picture of ordered di - vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath3 , we find a hexagonal @xmath12 superlattice which contains 12 unit cells . due to the unique triangular cobalt lattice structure and its stacking sequence </S>",
    "<S> , we find a special stability for a model of alternating layers of na tri - vacancy and quadri - vacancy , so that @xmath3 is understood to be the average of 3/4 and 2/3 doping . </S>",
    "<S> these results are supported by @xmath13na nmr . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis builds on the vacancy clustering model suggested by roger _ </S>",
    "<S> et al._@xcite however our finding that tri- and quadri - vacancies are more stable at smaller @xmath1 than di - vacancies is contrary to their proposal .    our picture of the na vacancy leads naturally to an electronic model where a fraction of co@xmath14 holes are bound to na vacancies , resulting in the co - existence of @xmath15 local moments and itinerant carriers . for @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , we find an extremely low fermi temperature of 87  k for the itinerant carriers which may explain the high thermopower and the emergence of ferromagnetism in the layer . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath3 , we suggest that the curie - weiss metal may be indicative of a novel quantum spin liquid phase for the local moments .    na ions are easily lost during high temperature preparation,@xcite and they continue to diffuse to the surface layer even after stoichiometric sample is fully reacted and stored at room temperature.@xcite adding extra na into the precursor has been a common practice in the powder sample preparation in order to compensate for the high temperature na loss . alternatively  rapid heat - up \" technique is applied to reduce na loss.@xcite however neither method can control na level to the nominal concentration perfectly within a few percent error while 3 - 4 % difference would introduce a completely different vacancy ordering patterns . </S>",
    "<S> many inconsistent results reported between @xmath16 before are due to inaccurate na content or inconsistent ordered patterns . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the much lower surface - to - bulk ratio in single crystal form , we believe structure work based on single crystal prepared using room temperature de - intercalation method is the most reliable route to study na ( vacancy ) ordering . </S>",
    "<S> the na concentration of single crystal sample in this study has been checked thoroughly using electron microprobe analysis ( epma ) from more than 10 points from freshly cleaved surface and c - axis parameters are calibrated against to those reported in the literature . combining our series of single crystal samples calibrated with epma@xcite and the reported powder sample calibrated with icp analysis,@xcite the c - axis versus na content relationship falls into a linear relationship of @xmath17 in the range of @xmath18 . as a byproduct of the present paper </S>",
    "<S> , we can recommend with confidence the use of this @xmath19-axis formula as a way of determining @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this scale is anchored at two special points , @xmath3 and @xmath2 where the @xmath19 axes are @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively . as we shall see , </S>",

    "<S> its final equilibrated open circuit potential ( ocp ) versus @xmath1 is summarized in fig.[fig : fig-1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the most prominent feature in fig.[fig : fig-1 ] is the step at @xmath3 vs applied voltage , indicating that @xmath3 is an exceptionally stable phase . </S>",
    "<S> this is very surprising because the naive expectation is for steps at rational fractions such as @xmath28 or @xmath29 , but such steps are either weak or non - existent .    </S>",
    "<S> another indication that @xmath3 is a specially ordered structure comes from the fact that crystals of exceptional homogeneity can be grown at this concentration . </S>",
    "<S> the residual resistivity of @xmath3 is low among the cobaltate family@xcite and has been measured by m. lee and n. p. ong to be as low as @xmath30-cm at 0.3  k in our crystals . </S>",
    "<S> this is seven times lower than commonly reported in the literature@xcite and corresponds to @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the mean free path . </S>",
    "<S> the special order also leads to narrow nmr lines which we will take advantage of later .    </S>",

    "<S> the major character of this laue pattern is the 12 spots ring that formed near \\{100 } peaks of the original lattice . as shown in the fig.[fig : fig-2](c ) , these spots consist of 2 sets of six - fold rings rotated by @xmath47 , where each set is indexed using two simple hexagonal unit cells with @xmath48 . direct evidence of this model comes from electron diffraction with a beam size of @xmath49  nm , which shows 6-fold rings coming from one of two domains . </S>",

    "<S> however , they fitted the pattern with a 15-site monoclinic superstructure which contains one tri - vacancy . </S>",
    "<S> this model gives a na content of @xmath52 , inconsistent with @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> we suspect that their sample grown by high temperature quench may suffer from inhomogeneity and uncertainty with respect to @xmath1 determination </S>",
    "<S> . it will be useful to check if their pattern can also be indexed with our structure model .    </S>",
    "<S> next we discuss the stacking properties of the na vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> we first review the salient feature of the parent @xmath53 lattice of @xmath45 symmetry using @xmath2 unit cell as shown in fig.[fig : fig-3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the unit cell consists of two layers of cobalt atoms located directly on top of each other and layers of na atoms sandwiched in between . </S>",
    "<S> there are two na sites in each layer , called na1 at ( 0,0,@xmath54 ) and na2 ( @xmath55,@xmath56,@xmath54 ) , the latter being the preferred site because na1 sits directly on top of the positively charged co and is more costly electrostatically . </S>",
    "<S> na2 sits in the center of a prismatic cage formed by six oxygens in each layer , and the two na layers ( labeled @xmath57 ) are distinguished by the different position of these prismatic cages . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the na sites , there are sites sitting directly under oxygen which we refer to as o sites . </S>",
    "<S> note that in layer a the na2 and o sites occupy the center of the down and up pointing triangles , respectively , but their positions are interchanged when we go from layer a to layer b. this will have crucial consequences later . </S>",
    "<S> the di - vacancy is formed by creating three na2 vacancies ( shown in yellow ) and then occupying a na1 site.@xcite since the di - vacancies are centered on the na1 site , they can stack directly on top of each other , going from layer a to b. on the other hand , out of phase stacking , for example by placing the di - vacancy at the center of the green diamond shown in fig.[fig : fig-3 ] produces ambiguity because two such sites are equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> this will lead to disorder . at present </S>",
    "<S> it is not possible to distinguish between in phase and out of phase stacking by refinement .     </S>",
    "<S> * 2d and 3d structure model of @xmath58 . * the unit cell for x = 0.71 before considering the 3c stacking . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath44 superlattice structure of tri - vacancy in layer a and quadri - vacancy in layer b are shown with green solid lines . </S>",
    "<S> note the vacancies consist of na1 trimers surrounded by empty na2 sites ( yellow circles).,width=316 ]    next we turn to the @xmath3 sample which , as mentioned earlier , is special in its stability . </S>",
    "<S> density function theory ( dft ) model calculations indicate special stability for @xmath59 and our initial expectation was to search for hexagonal @xmath60 superstructure of di - vacancies.@xcite instead , we discovered hexagonal superstructure at @xmath61 which contains 12 na2 sites per unit cell per layer . </S>",
    "<S> we are then led to consider tri- and quadri - vacancies in order to account for the 0.29 missing na ions . </S>",
    "<S> these vacancies were described by roger _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_.@xcite and shown in fig.[fig : fig-4 ] , where we emphasize the special role of a , b stacking . </S>",
    "<S> the tri- and quadri - vacancies consist of na1 trimers surrounded by six and seven na2 vacancies ( shown in yellow ) , respectively . note that the trimer in the tri - vacancy is centered on the o site while the trimer in the quadri - vacancy is centered on the na2 site . </S>",
    "<S> recall that the role of o and na2 sites are reversed between layers a and b. this has the remarkable consequence that tri - and quadri - vacancies can stack coherently , e.g. they can either ( i ) stack in phase , with tri - vacancy and quadri - vacancy sitting directly on top of each other , or ( ii ) stack out of phase , with tri - vacancy on site a in layer a and quadri - vacancy either directly below the d site or below the b , c sites . </S>",
    "<S> ( these sites are defined in fig [ fig : fig-4 ] . ) </S>",
    "<S> the alternating stacking of tri- and quadri - vacancies lead to @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> we believe the special stacking property described above is responsible for the exceptional stability of the 0.71 na concentration .    </S>",
    "<S> we expect out of phase stacking to be more favorable by electrostatic consideration . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the c - axis periodicity could be multiplied due to a versatile ab stacking combinations , e.g. a@xmath63b@xmath64 ( c ) , a@xmath63b@xmath64a@xmath63b@xmath65 ( 2c ) or a@xmath63b@xmath64a@xmath65b@xmath63a@xmath64b@xmath65 ( 3c ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have found evidence of 3c modulation through both single crystal electron diffraction as well as synchrotron x - ray powder diffraction techniques , which is discussed in detail in the supplementary section . </S>",
    "<S> the evidence of 3c modulation supports a@xmath63b@xmath64a@xmath65b@xmath63a@xmath64b@xmath65 stacking and indicates that simple electrostatic consideration dominates the stacking sequence of vacancy cluster units between layers .    </S>",
    "<S> we next consider stacking of tri - vacancies in the ab layers ( tt ) to form @xmath66 , or stacking quadri - vacancies ( qq ) to form @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> note that unlike the 0.71 case considered earlier , there are now three equivalent choices to stack the center of na1 trimers in the case of tt and qq stacking . </S>",
    "<S> this is true for both in - phase and out - of - phase stacking . </S>",
    "<S> such triangular ambiguity introduces significant disordering for the tt and qq vacancy clusters , which could be the major reason why @xmath3 is the most stable phase among these three types of stacking . indeed , as shown in fig.[fig : </S>",
    "<S> fig-1 ] , the stability range for @xmath33 and 0.67 are relatively narrow as indicated by the @xmath68 plateau in the electrochemical preparation .     * @xmath13na nmr spectra for @xmath58 . </S>",

    "<S> width=316 ]    we have also performed @xmath13na nmr measurements of @xmath3 crystal . the central transition @xmath72 and the lower satellites @xmath73 are shown in fig .  5 . </S>",
    "<S> these lines are considerably narrower than what were previously reported in the literature,@xcite and are also narrow compared with our crystals at other na concentrations . the central line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5(b ) separates into two groups with different knight shifts and we assign the minority as na1 as indicated in the figure . </S>",
    "<S> the satellite peaks of na2 further split into two peaks , na2a and na2b , due to the difference in the nuclear quadrupole interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we measured the weight of the na1  :  na2a  :  na2b lines to be 36.3%  :  37.1%  :  26.5% with an error of @xmath74 . in our structure model </S>",
    "<S> we have three na1 and six na2 in layer a ( tri - vacancy layer ) and three na1 and five na2 in layer b ( quadri - vacancy layer ) . </S>",
    "<S> the na1 form trimers and have similar environments in both layers . the total fraction of na1 is predicted to be @xmath75 , in excellent agreement with observation . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the sharpness of the lines allows accurate weight determination which can be used to rule out other structure models . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if layer b were to contain two di - vacancies instead of a single quadri - vacancy per unit cell , leaving the @xmath1 value unchanged , that layer would have two na1 and six na2 sites and the total fraction of na1 is predicted to be @xmath76 , inconsistent with the measured value . </S>",
    "<S> generally , the existence of di - vacancy and mono - vacancy will decrease the na1 fraction beyond what is permissible , giving us great confidence in our assignment of tri- and quadri - vacancy to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the six na2 sites have identical environments in layer a , while in layer b five na2 are separated into two groups of 2 sites with three na2 nearest neighbors and 3 sites with two na2 and one na1 nearest neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> provided that the splitting of the latter group is not resolved , it is tempting to assign the na2a and na2b lines to the a and b layers , respectively , in which case the weight ratio of na1 : na2a : na2b is predicted to be 6  :  6 :  5  =  35.3%  :  35.3%  :  29.4% , within error of the observation .    </S>",
    "<S> what are the consequences of the na superstructure order for the electronic properties of the cobalt oxide planes ? </S>",
    "<S> first we consider @xmath2 . starting from the band insulator @xmath77 , </S>",
    "<S> there are 2/13 holes in an otherwise filled band . </S>",
    "<S> it is natural that one hole will be bound to each di - vacancy , forming a localized @xmath15 spin . </S>",
    "<S> the second hole remains itinerant , explaining the metallic nature of this state . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a model of local moments on a triangular lattice interacting with an antiferromagnetic heisenberg exchange @xmath78 and coupled to an equal density of conduction electrons via a kondo coupling @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> this model is not sufficient to describe the physics of @xmath2 cobaltate , because the ground state is predicted to be either a metal with an antiferromagnetically ordered moment ( with nearest neighbor spins forming a @xmath80 angle ) or a kondo insulator , whereas the experiment requires a metallic ground state with ferromagnetic order in the plane . to see where the ferromagnetism comes from </S>",
    "<S> , we need to put in some numbers . </S>",
    "<S> the specific heat shows a peak at the magnetic transition @xmath81 with a low temperature linear @xmath82 coefficient @xmath24 of @xmath83  mj / co - mole.@xcite the extrapolation of the linear @xmath82 contribution from above @xmath81 gives @xmath84 mj / co - mole.@xcite assuming a spin unpolarized parabolic band , the latter value gives a mass @xmath85 m@xmath86 . in a nearest neighbor tight binding fit to the band structure </S>",
    "<S> , this corresponds to a hopping matrix element @xmath87 mev . </S>",
    "<S> this is a factor of 6 or 7 mass enhancement compared with the typical tight binding fit to lda bands . </S>",
    "<S> coulomb repulsion is presumably responsible for this enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> assuming this @xmath88 and a hole density of @xmath89 carriers per co , we obtain a fermi temperature of 87 k. this exceptionally low energy scale has several important consequences .    </S>",
    "<S> first , in a narrow band with low energy , we expect a ferromagnetic tendency due to the stoner mechanism , i.e. , it is favorable to spin polarize to gain exchange energy at the expense of kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we believe that the ground state is fully spin polarized to form a `` half - metal . '' </S>",
    "<S> this will explain why the @xmath24 term in the specific heat drops by approximately a factor of 2 ( from 24 to 10 mj / co - mole ) across @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the _ fully polarized _ </S>",
    "<S> band has a fermi surface area exactly equal to that of the reduced brillouin zone ( both equal to @xmath89 of the full zone ) . </S>",
    "<S> intersection of an almost circular hole fermi surface with a hexagonal reduced brillouin zone ( both equal to @xmath89 of the full zone ) gives rise to small hole pockets and electron pockets , the latter being centered at the zone corner . </S>",
    "<S> recently , l. balicas and co - workers have observed small pockets in quantum oscillation studies of our x=0.84 crystals , which lends support to this picture .    </S>",
    "<S> the physical picture is that the ferromagnetic tendency among the conduction electrons opposes the kondo coupling to form a singlet with the local moments , thereby suppressing the kondo insulator state . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath15 heisenberg model on a triangular lattice is subject to strong quantum fluctuations and the @xmath80 order may be greatly suppressed or eliminated entirely due to the kondo coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the full many - body problem is a complicated one which deserves a separate study . in the supplementary information section we outline a simple mean field treatment which captures some features of the susceptibility .    </S>",
    "<S> here we emphasize that the very small fermi temperature helps explain the enhanced thermopower for @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> conventional sommerfeld theory predicts @xmath90 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 is expected to roll over above @xmath93 to a constant which depends on the classical configuation ( the heikes formula).@xcite experimentally , @xmath92 shows a shallow peak around 100  k for @xmath2 and the fit to low temperature sommerfeld theory yields @xmath94 30  k. we see that the crossover scale is about right and explains the success of the heikes formula at these relatively low temperatures,@xcite while the overall linear @xmath82 slope and the magnitude need a factor of 3 enhancement compared with our estimate of @xmath95  k. one possible source of enhancement is the deviation from a parabolic band because the band calculation shows severe flattening and even a dimple at the @xmath96 point . </S>",
    "<S> thermopower relies on the breaking of particle - hole symmetry , which is enhanced by a mass which decreases with increasing hole energy . </S>",
    "<S> supporting evidence of this possibility comes from the observation that the low temperature @xmath24 term for the spin polarized band ( 10  mj ) is less than half of that extrapolated from high temperature ( 24  mj ) . </S>",
    "<S> a second indication of the small fermi energy comes from the hall effect . </S>",
    "<S> the hall constant @xmath97 is predicted to be linear in @xmath98 , a special consequence of hopping on a triangular lattice.@xcite experimentally @xmath97 is linear in @xmath82 above @xmath99  k , and saturates to a very small value at low temperature.@xcite the latter may be a consequence of cancellations between the small electron and hole pocket mentioned earlier .    </S>",
    "<S> optical measurements provide direct evidence for heavy mass and small carrier density . </S>",
    "<S> the low frequency conductivity consists of a broad peak centered around 150  @xmath100 and a narrow drude peak with a spectral weight estimated to be @xmath101 of that of the broad peak.@xcite we associate the broad peak with the hole bound to the na vacancy . </S>",
    "<S> the drude weight was estimated to correspond to @xmath102  @xmath100 from which @xmath103 can be extracted.@xcite if we assume @xmath104 , we find @xmath105 to be even smaller @xmath106 than our estimate based on our model of 1/13 mobile carrriers per co. this extremely small drude weight is very difficult to understand if all the holes are mobile .    </S>",
    "<S> next we turn our attention to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this state , dubbed the `` curie - weiss metal '' is in many ways the most mysterious among all the doping concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath81 transition disappears and @xmath107 keeps rising with decreasing @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> the resistivity @xmath108 is linear down to @xmath109  k. the uniqueness of this behavior even in comparison with heavy fermion compounds has been emphasized by li _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_.@xcite    the observation of curie - weiss behavior in a metal again calls for the coexistence of local moments and itinerant electrons . as an example , let us assume out of phase stacking of tri- and quadri- vacancies and that the quadri - vacancy binds a hole on each of the neighboring co planes , forming an @xmath110 local moment on each plane . </S>",
    "<S> the local moment forms a triangular lattice with one @xmath15 per 12 cobalt . for @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> the concentration of itinerant carriers is 2.5/12 @xmath111 0.208 per co , which is 2.7 times that of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we then expect a fermi temperature of 235  k. the higher carrier density reduces the tendency towards stoner instability , which explains the absence of a magnetic phase transition . in support of this picture </S>",
    "<S> , we note that in the thermopower , the saturation scale has moved to room temperature or above@xcite and the fit of the low @xmath82 data to @xmath112 yields @xmath113  k , consistent with our estimate and much larger than that for @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that a picture of conduction electrons coexisting with local moments which do not order down to the lowest temperature suggests the existence of a novel ground state for the spin system called the quantum spin liquid . </S>",
    "<S> while this possibility has been proposed in the literature,@xcite there has been no known experimental realization . </S>",
    "<S> a system of @xmath15 on a triangular lattice coupled to a narrow band of conduction electrons with some ferromagnetic tendency may provide just the needed frustration to stabilize such a state . </S>",
    "<S> we note that spin liquid on a triangular lattice is expected to support a spinon fermi surface,@xcite with @xmath114 predicted to behave as@xcite    @xmath115^{-1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath116 is twice the spinon fermi vector and @xmath117 is a critical exponent which was estimated to be 0.35 in a large @xmath118 expansion . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ chi ] ) has unique signatures which can be tested by neutron scattering .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the observation of na superlattice structure in the special na concentrations of 0.84 and 0.71 show the importance of na ordering in determining the unusual electronic properties . we have introduced a minimal model of local moments coexisting with itinerant electrons which accounts for many of the puzzling features observed in @xmath2 and which forms the starting point for unraveling the mystery surrounding the `` curie - weiss metallic '' phase of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we believe exciting discoveries of exotic states of matter may lie ahead . </S>"
