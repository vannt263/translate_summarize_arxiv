    "the standard model of cosmology , the so - called @xmath4cdm with the minimal six parameters , can explain well a wide range of cosmological observations , such as primordial abundance of light elements , cosmic microwave background(cmb ) and large scale structures(lss ) . meanwhile , there are still some hints that indicate that new physics beyond the minimal @xmath4cdm model maybe is needed in order to explain cdm sector better",
    ".    there are three controversies for cdm paradigm on small cosmological scales , _",
    "cusp vs. core _ , _ too - big - to - fail _ and _ missing satellites _ ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) , which have triggered both astrophysical @xcite and dm - related investigations  @xcite .",
    "a solution that resolves simultaneously these controversies has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where both dm and active neutrino interact with a new gauge boson with mass round @xmath5 .",
    "then the dm s velocity - dependent self - scattering cross section can be around @xmath6@xmath7 g at the dwarf satellites scale , and evades the constraints from milky way galaxy and galaxy cluster .",
    "thus one can resolve the first two controversies .",
    "meanwhile , the dm s scattering off cosmic neutrino background leads to its late kinetic decoupling at temperature @xmath8 , which is translated into a cut - off of the smallest protohalo mass @xmath9 , resolving the 3rd puzzle , namely missing satellites problem .",
    "however , since active neutrino couples to a mev particle , such scenario is restrictively constrained  @xcite .",
    "the cmb data indicates that a small amount of relativistic species or hot dark matter(hdm ) could exist at cmb time  @xcite , in addition to the standard three generations of active neutrinos .",
    "this is often parametrized as the effective number of additional neutrino species @xmath10 .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the best fit to all available data is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the effective hdm mass .",
    "also , it was shown very recently that a similar amount of hdm can help to relieve the tension of tensor - to - scalar ratio ( @xmath13 ) between planck data  @xcite and the recently announced measurement of b - mode polarization by bicep2  @xcite , without a running spectral index  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that sterile neutrino can serve as a hdm component of the universe .",
    "sterile neutrino is also well motivated in order to solve accelerator  @xcite , reactor  @xcite and gallium anomalies  @xcite in neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "both reactor and gallium anomalies prefer a new mass - squared difference , @xmath14  @xcite , while accelerator experiments  @xcite prefer @xmath15 . in all three cases",
    "the favored mixing angles are around @xmath16 .",
    "such a large mixing angle would in general lead to fully thermalized sterile neutrinos by oscillation and thus an increase of @xmath17 for each sterile neutrino .",
    "this is in some tension with the above cosmological data eq .",
    "( 1 ) , as shown in global fit  @xcite including bbn , cmb and lss data",
    ".    the above tension can be relieved by introducing new interaction for sterile neutrino .",
    "the new interaction can generate a matter potential @xmath18 that results in a tiny effective mixing angle @xmath19 in matter  @xcite for @xmath20 , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the mixing angle in vacuum . as a result",
    ", the thermalization of sterile neutrino by oscillation can be suppressed and @xmath23 is easily obtained  @xcite .",
    "recently it has been shown that the tension in the data can be reconciled at @xmath24 level within an _ effective _ theory  @xcite where a dim-5 operator is responsible for the active - sterile neutrino mixing .    in this paper , we propose a _ ultraviolet _",
    "complete theory for dm and sterile neutrino that can accommodate the aforementioned cosmological data and neutrino oscillation experiments within @xmath0 level .",
    "the model includes both cdm and hdm , and we call it the @xmath25mdm(the first m stands for mixed ) .",
    "we consider the standard seesaw model with two right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos ( gauge singlet ) @xmath26 in the lagrangian  [ eq : lag ] for leptogenesis  @xcite , which will not affect our discussions in the following . ] , and add a dark sector with @xmath1 gauge symmetry and coupling @xmath27 , and dark photon field @xmath28 , and dark higgs field @xmath29 and two different dirac fermion @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the dark sector .",
    "all the new fields are sm gauge singlets .",
    "we assign equal @xmath32 charges to @xmath33 and @xmath30 , which is normalized to @xmath6",
    ". then the most general gauge invariant renormalizable lagrangian is given by    @xmath34^{2 } - \\lambda_{\\phi h}\\left[\\phi_{x}^{\\dagger}\\phi_{x } - \\frac{v_{\\phi}^{2}}{2}\\right]\\left[h^{\\dagger}h-\\frac{v_{h}^{2}}{2}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ eq : lag ]    where @xmath35 are the sm left - handed lepton doublets , @xmath36 is the sm higgs doublet , and @xmath37 is the field strength for sm @xmath38 . the covariant derivative on a field @xmath39 is defined as @xmath40 we have chosen the @xmath1 charge for @xmath31 in such a way that the @xmath41 term is forbidden by @xmath1 gauge symmetry ( otherwise @xmath31 may decay if kinamatically allowed ) .",
    "thus @xmath31 would be stable and the dm candidate .",
    "the local gauge symmetry is broken by the following vacuum configurations : @xmath42 where @xmath43gev and @xmath44(mev ) for our interest .",
    "there will be mixings among various fields after the spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "the gauge kinetic mixing term results in tiny mixings among the physical gauge fields , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "also there is a mixing between higgs fields @xmath47 and @xmath48 with @xmath49 two scalar excitations @xmath47 and @xmath48 can be expressed in terms of mass eigenstates , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , as @xmath52 with a mixing angle @xmath53 . because of the higgs portal interaction ( @xmath54 term ) and the additional scalar @xmath48 , the electroweak vacuum could be stable up to planck scale without additional new physics beyond the particle contents presented in eq .",
    "( 2 ) ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for example ) .",
    "a novel feature of this model is that there can be mixing among three active neutrinos @xmath55 , sterile neutrinos @xmath56 and dark fermion @xmath30 due to @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 after spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking . in order to correctly explain the active neutrino oscillation data ,",
    "at least two @xmath60 s are needed , in which case two of @xmath61 are massive and the other one is massless .",
    "then after diagonalization of @xmath62 mass matrix for @xmath63 and @xmath30 , mass eigenstates are composed of 7 majorana neutrinos , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , or collectively @xmath66 : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the unitary mixing matrix that diagonalizes the mass matrix @xmath69 , @xmath70_{3\\times 2 } & 0_{3\\times 2 } \\\\ \\dfrac{v}{\\sqrt{2}}[y_{\\alpha i}]^t_{2\\times 3 } & \\left[m^{r}_{ij}\\right]_{2\\times 2 } &   \\dfrac{v_\\phi}{\\sqrt{2}}(f_i \\ ; g_i)_{2\\times 2}\\\\ 0_{2\\times 3 } & \\dfrac{v_\\phi}{\\sqrt{2}}(f_i \\ ; g_i)^t_{2\\times",

    "the mixing also distributes the new @xmath1 gauge / yukawa interaction to all neutrinos with actual couplings depending on the exact mixing angles .",
    "we assume that the mixing angles between @xmath55 and @xmath30 are negligible , compared to the mixing between @xmath56 and @xmath30",
    ". this can be easily achieved by adjusting @xmath72 s , @xmath73 s and @xmath74 s .",
    "a more straightforward way is to work in the flavor basis , in which only @xmath56 and @xmath48 have dark yukawa and gauge interactions , respectively . because of the new dark interactions for @xmath71 , all sterile neutrinos @xmath71 s are not thermalized by oscillation from active neutrinos and thus can contribute to the number of effective neutrino by a proper amount , @xmath75 after bbn  @xcite .",
    "the exact mass spectrum and mixing angles for @xmath71 are free , subject to conditions for fitting the data .",
    "we shall take at least one @xmath71 is around 1  ev and others as free , lighter or heavier , and the mixing angles among @xmath71 are large enough for suppressing their production by oscillation from active neutrino .",
    "based on a different setup , our model improves a similar attempt presented in a recent paper  @xcite in two aspects .",
    "first , our model is renormalizable and thus ultraviolet complete , while the model in ref .",
    "@xcite assumed a dim-5 operator for generating the active - sterile neutrino mixing and therefore depends on the uv completion .",
    "second , we shall show below that the model presented in the present paper can reconcile the current cosmological data with neutrino oscillation experiments within @xmath0 rather than only within @xmath24 as discussed in @xcite .",

    ", the dark sector decouples from the thermal bath of the visible sector and entropy density would be conserved separately in each sector .",

    "the dominant annihilation channel in this model is @xmath93 , and the relic density requires the gauge coupling @xmath27 to be  @xcite @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the @xmath1 charge of @xmath31 and shall be taken @xmath3 for definiteness in later discussion .",

    "@xcite and gives the approximate order - of - magnitude estimation , although the precise formula may depend on the neutrino mixing angles from the couplings @xmath101 .",
