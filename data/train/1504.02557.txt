    "with the advent of charm and b - factories , a large amount of data for charmed - meson decays have been accumulated in the last decades . among a number of physical interests , one appealing aspect of studying these charmed - meson decays",
    "is that we can gain information about interactions between light mesons and resonances .",
    "this was particularly highlighted by the e791 collaboration s report on their identification of the @xmath8 meson in the dalitz plot of the @xmath9 decay  @xcite .",
    "a similar analysis was also made for the @xmath0 decay to identify the @xmath10 resonance  @xcite .",
    "these findings triggered further analyses of the @xmath0 dalitz plot data , paying special attention to the @xmath5 @xmath6-wave amplitude , as follows .",
    "oller  @xcite analyzed the e791 data  @xcite using the @xmath11 @xmath12=1/2 ( @xmath12 : total isospin ) @xmath6-wave amplitude based on the chiral unitary approach  @xcite , instead of breit - wigner functions for the @xmath5 @xmath6-wave used in the e791 analysis , and obtained a reasonable fit .",
    "the @xmath12=3/2 @xmath6-wave was not considered in his analysis .",
    "the e791 collaboration reanalyzed their data without assuming a particular functional form for the @xmath5 @xmath6-wave amplitude .",
    "rather , they determined it bin by bin , which they call model independent partial - wave analysis ( mipwa )  @xcite .",
    "an interesting finding in the mipwa was that the obtained @xmath5 @xmath6-wave amplitude has the phase that depends on the @xmath5 energy in a manner significantly different from what is expected from the watson theorem combined with the lass empirical amplitude  @xcite , assuming the @xmath12=1/2 dominance .",
    "edera et al .",
    "suggested that this difference can be understood as a substantial mixture of the @xmath11 @xmath12=1/2 and 3/2 @xmath6-wave amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "this idea was implemented in the dalitz plot analysis done by the focus collaboration  @xcite .",
    "they parametrized the @xmath5 @xmath6-wave amplitude in terms of the @xmath13-matrix of @xmath12=1/2 and 3/2 that had been fitted to the lass amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "they found that the @xmath0 dalitz plot can be well fitted with the @xmath5 @xmath6-wave amplitude in which the @xmath12=1/2 and 3/2 components interfere with each other in a rather destructive manner .",
    "the focus collaboration also has done a mipwa in a subsequent work  @xcite to find results similar to those of the e791 mipwa .",
    "the quasi - mipwa has also been done by the cleo collaboration  @xcite .",
    "their new finding was that @xmath12=2 @xmath1 nonresonant amplitude can give a non - negligible contribution .",
    "meanwhile , an analogous decay , @xmath14 , has been analyzed by the besiii collaboration  @xcite .",
    "an interesting finding was that the @xmath15 channel gives by far the dominant contribution .",
    "this implies that , although the @xmath15 contribution is not directly observed in the @xmath0 dalitz plot , it can play a substantial role in the hadronic final state interactions ( fsi ) of the @xmath0 decay , considering that the two @xmath7 decays share the same hadronic dynamics to a large extent .",
    "many of the previous analyses of the @xmath0 dalitz plot have been done with the so - called isobar model in which a @xmath7-meson decays into an excited state @xmath16 ( @xmath17 , etc . ) and a pseudoscalar meson .",
    "the @xmath16 subsequently decays into a pair of light pseudoscalar mesons , while the third pseudoscalar meson is treated as a spectator . the propagation of @xmath16 is commonly parametrized by a breit - wigner function .",
    "the total decay amplitude is given by a coherent sum of these isobar amplitudes supplemented by a flat interfering background .",
    "on the other hand , as mentioned in the above paragraph , some analysis groups modified the conventional isobar model to use the @xmath13-matrix or chiral unitary model for the @xmath5 @xmath6-wave amplitude so that the consistency with the lass data for @xmath18 and with the two - body unitarity is maintained .",
    "meanwhile , in ( q)mipwa , the @xmath5 @xmath6-wave amplitude is solely determined by the @xmath0 dalitz plot data .",
    "we will refer to these models , which do not explicitly consider three - meson - rescattering required by the three - body unitarity , as isobar - type models .",
    "the basic assumptions common to all of these models are that the spectator pseudoscalar meson interacts with the others very weakly , and/or @xmath19 ( @xmath20 : spectator meson ) vertices with complex coupling constants can absorb such effects .",
    "although each analysis group has obtained a reasonable fit to its own data , their results are not necessarily in conformity with theoretical expectations .",
    "for example , the e791 collaboration reported that the phase of the @xmath12=1/2 @xmath21 @xmath22-wave amplitude used in their mipwa is , according to the watson theorem , not consistent with that of the lass analysis in the elastic region  @xcite .",
    "this may be originated from either or both of two possible reasons below , each of which signals a serious problem in the basic assumptions underlying in the analysis model .",
    "one possible reason is that the @xmath12=1/2 @xmath21 @xmath22-wave amplitude in the e791 analysis is given by a coherent sum of breit - wigner functions for @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and it is not consistent with the lass data to the required precision . or the amplitude does not satisfy the two - body unitarity not only formally but also quantitatively .",
    "another possibility is that the ( neglected ) rescattering of the spectator meson with the other mesons actually plays a substantial role to generate an energy - dependent phase so that the watson theorem does not hold in reality , and the analysis model tried to fit it .",
    "not only the e791 analysis but also all the previous analyses mentioned above would share the same problem , and this seems to indicate a need for going beyond the conventional isobar - type analysis ; a unitary coupled - channel approach . in order to extract from data a right physics , e.g. , @xmath5 @xmath6-wave amplitude from @xmath0 dalitz plot data , one needs to use a theoretically sound model so that unnecessary model artifacts do not come into play .",
    "recently , we have developed a unitary coupled - channel framework for describing a heavy - meson decay into three light mesons  @xcite ; both the two - body and three - body unitarity are maintained . in the reference , we studied the extent to which the isobar - type description of heavy - meson ( or excited meson ) decays is valid by analyzing simple pseudodata .",
    "we found a significant effect of the channel couplings and multiple rescattering on the dalitz plot distributions .",
    "this study has been extended to an analysis of pseudodata for excited meson photoproductions  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we apply the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite with some modifications to a realistic case .",
    "thus , we will perform a coupled - channel analysis of the @xmath0 dalitz plot pseudodata generated from the e791 isobar model  @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first coupled - channel dalitz plot analysis of a @xmath25-meson decay into three pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "we will demonstrate that a quantitative coupled - channel partial - wave analysis of the @xmath0 dalitz plot is feasible .",
    "then we will examine the hadronic dynamics in the fsi of the @xmath0 decay within the coupled - channel model .",
    "we will study how the partial - wave amplitudes and their fit fractions are different between an isobar - type model and a model that includes the three - body scattering .",
    "we also examine contributions from the rescattering and channel couplings to the dalitz plot distribution . through these investigations ,",
    "we address the validity of the above - mentioned basic assumptions of the isobar - type model from this more microscopic viewpoint .",
    "so far , the three - body fsi for the @xmath0 decay has been explored by magalhes et al .",
    "@xcite ( see also guimares et al .",
    "they were concerned with whether the difference in the phase between the @xmath5 @xmath6-wave amplitudes from mipwa ( e791  @xcite and focus  @xcite ) and the @xmath21 @xmath12=1/2 @xmath6-wave amplitude from the lass analysis can be understood as a result of the fsi .",
    "they calculated the @xmath5 @xmath6-wave amplitude in the @xmath0 decay with only the @xmath21 @xmath12=1/2 @xmath6-wave scattering amplitude of the chiral unitary model that had been fitted to the lass amplitude in the elastic region ; other partial waves as well as inelasticities were not taken into account .",
    "an interesting finding in their work was that the @xmath5 @xmath6-wave amplitude originated from the weak vector current and the subsequent @xmath6-wave rescattering is in a fairly good agreement with the phases from the mipwa in the elastic region ; the qualitative feature of the modulus of the mipwa amplitude is also described .",
    "this finding was further confirmed in their subsequent works  @xcite where @xmath26 contribution was also partly taken into account .",
    "although their results are interesting and suggestive , they should be looked with a caution for the reasons below .",
    "first , their calculated amplitudes are still qualitatively in agreement with those from the mipwa in the elastic region , and more refinements are needed particularly in the inelastic region .",
    "there will be a delicate interplay between new mechanisms to be included for the refinements and the already existing mechanisms , and thus it is not clear if their current findings persist after the refinements .",
    "second , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite treated the @xmath5 @xmath6-wave amplitudes from the mipwa as data , and did not analyze the dalitz plot directly .",
    "however , we note that the mipwa @xmath6-wave amplitude was obtained under the assumption that all the other partial - wave amplitudes are basically not changed by the fsi . in case the @xmath6-wave amplitude is significantly modified by the fsi , the other partial - wave amplitudes are also probably modified , and the mipwa @xmath6-wave amplitude may no longer be compatible with them . in order to fully examine the fsi effects on each of the partial - wave amplitudes for the @xmath0 decay ,",
    "it is first necessary to analyze the dalitz plot with a model that takes account of all relevant partial waves and the fsi , thereby extracting the partial - wave amplitudes , as we will do in this work",
    ". then , the fsi effects on the extracted amplitudes can be studied .    in our analysis",
    ", we use two - pseudoscalar - meson interactions that generate unitary amplitudes for @xmath21 and @xmath1 scatterings , and consider resonances ( @xmath27 , etc . ) as poles in the amplitudes .",
    "the two - body interactions are fitted to the lass and cern - munich  @xcite data . with the two - body interactions ,",
    "we solve the faddeev equation for a three - pseudoscalar - meson scattering to obtain an amplitude that respects the three - body unitarity and thus channel couplings .",
    "this amplitude is used to describe the fsi of the @xmath7 decay .",
    "the pseudodata are fitted by adjusting the strengths and phases of ( bare ) @xmath19 vertices , while the two - pseudoscalar - meson interactions are fixed as those obtained by fitting the two - body scattering data . in this way",
    ", we will examine the extent to which we can fit the @xmath7-decay pseudodata , keeping the consistency with the two - body scattering data for _ all _ partial waves considered in our model .",
    "this is in contrast with the previous @xmath0 analyses where some of the resonance parameters were also adjusted along with the @xmath19 vertices .",
    "we consider the @xmath12=1/2 @xmath21 @xmath6- , @xmath22- , and @xmath28-waves as commonly included in the previous analyses .",
    "we also explicitly include the @xmath12=3/2 @xmath21 @xmath6-wave ( @xmath12=2 @xmath1 @xmath6-wave ) as has been done so in the focus  @xcite ( cleo  @xcite ) analysis .",
    "we also consider the @xmath12=1 @xmath1 @xmath22-wave where the @xmath26 plays a major role .",
    "this partial wave has not been considered in the previous dalitz plot analyses because it does not directly decay into the @xmath29 final state . however",
    ", this partial wave can still contribute to @xmath0 through the channel couplings .",
    "considering the besiii analysis mentioned above , the @xmath15 channel is expected to play a substantial role also here , and we will see that this is indeed the case , at least within our analysis .",
    "now we discuss the last piece of our model .",
    "the fsi of the @xmath0 decay is a three - pseudoscalar - meson scattering .",
    "generally in a three - body scattering , there can exist a mechanism that can not be expressed by a combination of two - body mechanisms , i.e. , a three - body force .",
    "based on the hidden local symmetry ( hls ) model  @xcite , in which vector and pseudoscalar mesons are implemented together in a chiral lagrangian , we can actually derive a `` three - meson force '' essentially in a parameter - free fashion , up to form factors we include .",
    "thus we consider some of the hls - based three - meson force acting on important channels , and examine how they play a role in the @xmath0 decay .",
    "if two - pseudoscalar - meson interactions are well determined by precise two - body scattering data , the @xmath30 decays and also other decay modes such as @xmath31 could serve as a ground to study the three - meson force .",

    "ii of ref .",
