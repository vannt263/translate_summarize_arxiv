    "for heavy charged particle radiotherapy with protons and ions , broad - beam delivery methods ( coutrakon 1991 , kanai 1999 ) are mature technologies with persistent advantages of simplicity and robustness over emerging technologies of pencil - beam scanning methods ( lambert 2005 ) . for a broad - beam system ,",

    "the pb splitting reasonably sharpened the field edges at the immediate downstream and made better agreement with the measurements on the isocenter plane .",
    "ironically , the contamination of collimator - scattered particles happened to compensate substantially for the lack of edge sharpening in the tail regions .",
    "it is one of the algorithmic novelties of this study to originate the pencil beams at the effective scattering points of the rcf regardless of upstream collimation .",
    "then , the lateral heterogeneity of the rcf is naturally irrelevant to the minimized pencil beams .",
    "upstream collimation is reasonably modeled as filtering of particles in the angular distribution to correct the phase - space parameters of the defined pencil beams .",
    "while the pb size and density are generally arbitrary in pb algorithms , small size and high density are required to represent sharp edges of downstream collimation . in the present model , the sharp ptc edge was naturally realized by splitting of the pencil beams . in the former study ( kanematsu 2008b ) , because the pencil beams could not be redefined as monochromatic after range compensation , they were only artificially downsized for edge sharpening .",
    "the downsizing strength was empirically determined to reproduce the 20%80% penumbra size on the isocenter plane while overlooking the other aspects .",
    "in fact , while the resultant penumbra sizes were equivalently good for both models , the dose profiles in the upstream was unphysically bouncy in the former study due to insufficient density , which could be clinically problematic .    in the original pb - splitting algorithm ( kanematsu 2009 )",
    ", the overreaching condition was defined as the one - standard - deviation distance ( @xmath118 ) to a 10% density change .",
    "that was because its objective heterogeneity was moderate density variation among body tissues .",
    "this study deals with solid and precisely defined collimator edges , for which the @xmath119 distance to an aperture edge may be more appropriate .    in the present example , the ptc was effective only for approximately 1/4 of the field edge .",
    "the pb splitting was limited to the pencil beams around the effective edge and actually increased the number of beams by 80% and the cpu time by 4% .",
    "this discrepancy is mainly attributed to computational overhead for generation , upstream collimation , and range compensation of the pencil beams .",
    "although we only dealt with the planer grids in this case , the pb splitting would not add severe computational load even for volumetric grids when used with the grid - dose - spreading convolution ( kanematsu 2011 ) .    in heavy charged particle radiotherapy ,",
    "target doses are predominantly formed by bragg peaks of primary particles .",
    "hard - scattered particles are generally out of the scope of practical pb algorithms due to difficulty in their modeling .",
    "fortunately , the collimator - scattered particles tend to lose large energy in the collimator and thus naturally attenuate with depth ( van luijk 2001 ) .",
    "nevertheless , kimstrand ( 2008 ) included the collimator - scatter contribution in a convolution algorithm using monte - carlo - generated kernels .",
    "that approach may be valid and will further improve the accuracy if combined with the present model .",
    "we have developed a calculation model for customization of a broad beam of heavy charged particles based on the pb - splitting algorithm . in this model , a broad beam is decomposed into pencil beams of various size that is necessarily and sufficiently small to deal with structures of the beam - customization devices accurately and efficiently . also , placement of the pb origins at the effective scattering points in the rcf effectively reduced the relevant heterogeneity and greatly simplified the algorithm using only monochromatic pencil beams .",
    "the performance of the model was tested against existing experimental data , which demonstrated that the penumbra size for various collimator edges in a single field was accurate to a submillimeter level .",
    "this beam - customization part can be naturally combined with the patient - dose - calculation part that is similarly based on the pb - splitting algorithm ( kanematsu 2011 ) to complete an accurate and efficient dose calculation algorithm for treatment planning of heavy - charged - particle radiotherapy .",
