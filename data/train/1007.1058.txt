    "quantum field theory predicts that photons can be created from vacuum fluctuations when the boundary conditions of the field are time - dependent .",
    "this effect , often called the dynamical casimir effect , was predicted by g.t .",
    "moore @xcite in 1970 , in the context of a cavity comprised of two moving ideal mirrors . in 1976 ,",
    "fulling _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that a single mirror in free space also generates radiation , when subjected to a nonuniform acceleration .",
    "the role of the moving mirrors in these studies is to impose time - dependent boundary conditions on the electromagnetic fields .",
    "the interaction between the time - dependent boundary condition and the zero - point vacuum fluctuations can result in photon creation , for a sufficiently strong time - dependence @xcite .",
    "however , it has proven to be a difficult task to experimentally observe the dynamical casimir effect .",
    "the problem lies in the difficulty in changing the boundary conditions , e.g. , by moving physical objects , such as massive mirrors , sufficiently fast to generate a significant number of photons . although there are proposals ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) for experimentally observing the dynamical casimir effect using massive mirrors , no experimental verification of the dynamical casimir effect has been reported to date @xcite . in order to circumvent this difficulty a number of theoretical proposals have suggested to use experimental setups where the boundary conditions are modulated by some effective motion instead .",
    "examples of such proposals include to use lasers to modulate the reflectivity of thin semiconductor films @xcite or to modulate the resonance frequency of a superconducting stripline resonator @xcite , to use a squid to modulate the boundary condition of a superconducting waveguide @xcite , and to use laser pulses to rapidly modulate the vacuum rabi frequency in cavity qed systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate manifestations of the dynamical casimir effect in superconducting electrical circuits based on microfabricated ( including coplanar ) waveguides .",
    "recent theoretical and experimental developments in the field of superconducting electronics , which to a large extent is driven by research on quantum information processing @xcite , include the realization of strong coupling between artificial - atoms and oscillators @xcite ( so called circuit qed ) , studies of the ultra - strong coupling regime in circuit qed @xcite , single - artificial - atom lasing @xcite , fock - state generation and state tomography @xcite .",
    "also , there has recently been an increased activity in studies of multimode quantum fields in superconducting circuits , both theoretically and experimentally , see e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite , and in experimental work on frequency - tunable resonators @xcite .",
    "these studies exemplify how quantum - optics - like systems can be implemented in superconducting electrical circuits @xcite , where waveguides and resonators play the roles of light beams and cavities , and josephson - junction based artificial atoms play the role of natural atoms in the original quantum optics setups .    here",
    ", we theoretically investigate the possibility to exploit these recent advances to realize a system @xcite where the dynamical casimir effect can be observed experimentally in an electrical circuit .",
    "we consider two circuit configurations , see fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic - dce](c)-(d ) , for which we study the dynamical casimir effect in the broadband and narrowband limits , respectively .",
    "we analyze the properties of the radiation due to the dynamical casimir effect in these systems , and we identify a number of signatures in experimentally measurable signals that could be used to distinguish the radiation due to the dynamical casimir effect from other types of radiation , such as thermal noise .        the dynamical casimir effect has also previously been discussed in the context of superconducting electrical circuits in ref .",
    "@xcite . another related theoretical proposal to use superconducting electrical circuits to investigate photon creation due to nonadiabatic changes in the field parameters",
    "was presented in @xcite , where a circuit for simulating the hawking radiation was proposed .",
    "in contrast to these works , here we exploit the demonstrated fast tunability of the boundary conditions for a one - dimensional electromagnetic field , achieved by terminating a microfabricated waveguide with a squid @xcite .",

    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : review ] , we briefly review the dynamical casimir effect . in sec .  [",
    "sec : sc - dce - single - mirror ] , we propose and analyze an electrical circuit , fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic - dce](c ) , based on an open microfabricated waveguide , for realizing the dynamical casimir effect , and we derive the resulting output field state . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sc - dce - resonator ] , we propose and analyze an alternative circuit , fig .  [ fig : schematic - dce](d ) , featuring a waveguide resonator . in sec .  [ sec : measurement - setups ] , we investigate various measurement setups that are realizable in electrical circuits in the microwave regime , and we explicitly evaluate the photon - flux intensities and output - field correlation functions for the two setups introduced in sec .",
    "iii and iv . in sec .",
    "[ sec : parametric - oscillator ] , we explore the similarities between the dynamical casimir effect , in the resonator setup , and the closely related parametric oscillator with a kerr - nonlinearity .",
    "finally , a summary is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "[ tbl : static - vs - dynamical - casimir ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as the @xmath2 values of the resonator considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : sc - dce - resonator ] increases , its resonant modes are increasingly decoupled from the coplanar waveguide , and the modes become increasingly equidistant . in the limit @xmath3 , the system formally reduces to the ideal case of a closed one - dimensional cavity ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . however , this limit is not realistic for the type of circuits investigated here , because it corresponds to a regime where also the high - frequency modes are significantly excited , and this would violate our assumption that the squid is adiabatic ( i.e. , that the squid plasma frequency is the largest frequency in the problem ) . our theoretical analysis is also unsuitable for studying that extreme limit , since it implies that @xmath4 no longer is small .",
    "however , for moderate @xmath5-values , where @xmath4 is small and our analysis applies , it is still possible to make a comparison to a single - mode parametric oscillator ( po ) below its threshold .",
    "the hamiltonian for a pumped parametric oscillator @xcite with a kerr - nonlinearity can be written as @xmath6\\!\\!,\\;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and where the oscillator is assumed to couple to an environment that induces relaxation with a rate @xmath7 .",
    "the output field for the parametric oscillator is described by @xmath8 where @xmath9 see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite . comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq : a - out - po ] ) to the corresponding results for the dynamical casimir effect : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : r_res_full],[eq : s - res - omega - omega - d - ii ] ) , allows us to identify relations between the parametric oscillator parameters ( to first order in @xmath13 ) and the dynamical casimir parameters .",
    "we obtain @xmath14 and thereby establish a one - to - one mapping between these systems , valid for sufficiently large @xmath15 and below the parametric oscillator threshold : @xmath16 , i.e. , for @xmath17 using these expressions we can write a hamiltonian that describes the dynamical casimir effect in the resonator setup , @xmath18 , \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and where the capacitive coupling to the open coplanar waveguide induces relaxation with a rate @xmath19 in the resonator .",
    "this hamiltonian picture offers an alternative description of the photon creation process in the dynamical casimir effect in a resonator .",
    "this correspondence between the dynamical casimir effect and a parametric oscillator was also discussed in e.g.  ref .",
    "we have analyzed the dynamical casimir radiation in superconducting electrical circuits based on coplanar waveguides with tunable boundary conditions , which are realized by terminating the waveguides with squids .",
    "we studied the case of a semi - infinite coplanar waveguide , and the case of a coplanar waveguide resonator coupled to a semi - infinite waveguide , and we calculated the photon flux , the second - order coherence functions and the noise - power spectrum of field quadratures ( i.e. , the squeezing spectrum ) for the radiation generated due to the dynamical casimir effect .",
    "these quantities have distinct signatures which can be used to identify the dynamical casimir radiation in experiments .    for the single - mirror setup ,",
    "we conclude that the photon - flux density @xmath20 has a distinct inverted parabolic shape that would be a clear signature of the dynamical casimir effect .",
    "this feature in the photon - flux density should also be distinguishable in the presence of a realistic thermal noise background .    for the resonator setup ,",
    "the presence of resonances in the coplanar waveguide alters the mode density and concentrates the photon - flux density , of the dynamical casimir radiation , around the resonances , which can result in a larger signal within a smaller bandwidth .",
    "if the driving signal is detuned from the resonance frequency , the resulting photon - flux density spectrum features a bimodal structure , owing to the fact that photons are created in pairs with frequency that add up to the driving frequency .",
    "the characteristic behavior of these features in the photon - flux density spectrum should also be a clear indication of the dynamical casimir radiation .",
    "a resonance with a small quality factor could therefore make the experimental detection of the dynamical casimir effect easier . in the limit of large quality factor",
    ", however , the output field generated due to the dynamical casimir effect becomes increasingly similar to that of a classical system , which makes it harder to experimentally identify the presence of the dynamical casimir radiation @xcite .    for both the single - mirror setup and the resonator setup with low quality factor , the second - order coherence functions and the quadrature squeezing spectrum show signatures of the pairwise photon production and the closely related quadrature squeezing in the output field .",
    "the pairwise photon production of the dynamical casimir effect has much in common with a parametrically driven oscillator , and in the presence of a resonance this correspondence can be quantified , and the two systems can be mapped to each other even though the systems have distinct physical origins .",
    "this correspondence offers an alternative formulation of the dynamical casimir effect in terms of a hamiltonian for a resonator that is pumped via a nonlinear medium .",
