    "grb 060505 and its host galaxy have drawn particular attention in the grb community for several reasons .",
    "grb 060505 was one of two nearby long - duration grbs that had no accompanying supernova @xcite .",
    "due to its duration of only @xmath1 4s it was suggested that it could have intact been a short grb that naturally has no sn @xcite . however , the presence of a significant spectral lag @xcite and its afterglow properties @xcite favour a long grb origin .",
    "the host galaxy was somewhat unusual for a long - duration grb , a late - type , moderately star - forming , solar metallicity spiral galaxy .",
    "@xcite , however , found that the properties of the stellar population at the grb site very much resembled the global properties of dwarf grb hosts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) concerning metallicity and star formation rate .",
    "furthermore , it had a very young age , making the connection to a massive star even more likely .",
    "grb progenitor models suggest that long grbs can only be produced by metal poor stars , otherwise , large mass losses of the massive progenitor slows down the star such that it can not form an accretion disk at collapse ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , most long - duration grbs have been found in metal poor environments or galaxies though a few exceptions for high metallicity environments have been found , e.g. grb 020819 @xcite , grb 050826 @xcite , grb 080605 @xcite and grb 090323 @xcite .",
    "long duration grb hosts furthermore show a moderate to high star formation rate . in the low redshift universe",
    "those conditions are mainly met in dwarf irregular and blue compact galaxies , but probably also in the outskirts of late - type galaxies .",
    "short grb hosts seem to show different properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in line with the suggested origin in the coalescence of two compact objects .    in recent years",
    ", spatially resolved studies of grb and sn hosts have become increasingly important .",
    "high spatial resolution imaging with the _ hst _ correlated the brightness in the blue at different parts in the host to the one at the explosion site .",
    "while sn type ii are distributed evenly , grbs and type ic sne are associated to the blues regions of their hosts @xcite .",
    "likewise , wc ( cabon - oxygen wolf - rayet ) stars show a spatial distribution similar to sne type ic and grbs concerning the brightness of their surrounding region while wn ( nitrogen wolf - rayet ) stars correlate with the distribution of sne ib @xcite .",
    "short grbs , in contrast , are found predominantly in dimmer regions and with larger offsets from their host galaxy , consistent with an older population and/or kicks of the progenitor system from the birth site by the preceding sn explosion @xcite .    following the mass - metallicity relation ,",
    "some more massive grb hosts show a higher global metallicity of solar or supersolar values",
    ". however , most of them have actually a lower metallicity at the location of the grb @xcite .",
    "as they are usually located in the outskirts of their hosts this is expected due to the usual metallicity gradient in star - forming galaxies . however , some grb sites have still higher metallicities than theoretical models would require . grb 0208019 @xcite f.ex .",
    "showed a super - solar metallicity at the grb site , however , it was a `` dark grb '' ( no optical counterpart was detected @xcite ) .",
    "it is still debated weather the high metallicity might be the reason that those dark grbs are intrinsically faint ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and whether we have to revise our theoretical models .",
    "the site of the short grb 080905a @xcite in contrast showed an old population with little star formation , as expected .",
    "comparing grbs and sne , @xcite found a lower metallicity for grb sites compared to broad - line type ic sne without grb .",
    "the situation is less clear for comparing different types of sne , while @xcite finds a lower metallicities for type ib sne compared to type ic , @xcite do not see significant differences .",
    "recent ifu studies of sn sites indeed show differences in metallicity , sfr and age between different types of sn @xcite .",
    "detailed resolved studies using integral - field - spectroscopy has to date only been performed for the host of grb 980425 , the first grb observed to be connected to a broad - line type ic sn @xcite .",
    "the grb site turned out to be not the youngest , most metal poor and star - forming region in the galaxy and did not show any wr features , in contrast to another star - forming region next to the one of the grb site .",
    "this might imply that grbs do not need the extreme properties as suggested by stellar population models and/or other evolutionary channels such as binaries might play an additional role .",
    "however , the sample of well studied grb environment is still somewhat small to get some clear indications on the progenitors of these interesting events .    in this paper",
    ", we present integral field spectroscopic data of the host galaxy of grb 060505 together with high resolution spectra in two slitpositions placed along the galaxy ( sec .",
    "2 ) . this allows us to study the properties of the different star - forming regions in the galaxy in terms of metallicity , star - formation rate , stellar population age and extinction and to compare the grb region with other hii regions in the galaxy ( sec . 3 ) .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the kinematics of the galaxy to search for possible perturbations and other reasons for an increase in star - formation at the grb site ( sec .",
    "we obtained 9.85h of observations with the integral field unit ( ifu ) of the vimos instrument at the vlt between april and august 2008 .",
    "the setting with 0.67  lenslets and a 27  @xmath4 27  field - of - view ( fov ) provides a sampling of @xmath1  1kpc and easily covers the entire galaxy with one pointing .",
    "the seeing conditions during most of the observations , however , were larger than 07 , reducing the resolution to 134 or 2.2kpc .",
    "three different gratings were used , hr orange , hr blue and lr blue , to cover the wavelength range from 4000 to 7400  which includes all important diagnostic emission lines from [ oii ] to [ nii ] .",
    "the lr blue grating provides a resolution of @xmath5=250 whereas the hr orange and blue grism have resolutions of 2700 and 2600 respectively which barely resolves the emission lines .",
    "the data were reduced and fluxcalibrated using the eso vimos pipeline .",
    "the background was subtracted taking blank sections outside the galaxy in each of the four quadrants of the chip since they have slightly different readout noise and background levels . for each grism ,",
    "all exposures were stacked to one single datacube and bad fibres masked out before the combination .",
    "the absolute flux calibration was scaled to match the broad - band magnitudes as listed in @xcite using the integrated spectrum of the galaxy which also accounts for the large relative offset between the lrblue and the hr grisms . fig .",
    "[ vimosslits ] shows an `` image '' of the galaxy summed in wavelength over the width of the h@xmath3 line .",
    "furthermore , on july 16 , 2007 , we obtained two spectra with exposure times of 1800 and 1200s with hires and keck i at the keck observatory on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "using a 08 slit , hires provides a spectral resolution of 45,000 or @xmath1 7 km / s . with",
    "the red setting used , the orders almost overlap in the blue between 3990 and 4100  but this does not affect the [ oii ] emission lines present in this part of the spectrum .",
    "the hires slit has a length of 7  and was positioned at two different angles on the galaxy to cover the hii region at the grb site , the center of the galaxy and another nearby hii region .",
    "the first position was chosen at the same angle ( 17 deg ) as for the low - resolution spectra presented in @xcite , the second slit was positioned at zero degrees or north - south to cover the other large hii region west of the grb position ( see fig.[vimosslits ] ) .",
    "the keck / hires data were reduced using the hiredux pipelinexavier / hiredux / index.html ] bundled within the xidlxavier / idl / index.html ] software package .",
    "we used the pipeline to produce two - dimensional spectral images , calibrated in wavelength by tracing the thar lamp exposures .",
    "a rough estimate of the flux calibration was performed using the 1d spectra of spectrophotometric standard stars obtained on the same night .",
    "these do not account for slit losses but should provide good estimates ( @xmath6 ) to the relative flux .",
