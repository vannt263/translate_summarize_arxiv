    "the feshbach theory of the optical potential provides a formal tool for developing a description of the scattering of nucleons from nuclei in terms of the microscopic interaction . in its most standard application , this",
    "is done by reducing the hilbert space to a subspace that contains only the core nucleus and the additional particle in a scattering or bound single particle state . since the scattered particle is not allowed to occupy the orbitals filled by the core nucleons , this subspace can only exhaust the part of the one - body hilbert space the lies above the fermi energy ) .",
    "several models of nucleon - nucleus scattering ( such as cluster model or folding potentials ) implicitly use this approach and have been applied with significant success .",
    "however , the above limitation can be avoided by considering a fock space ( without a definite number of particles ) and applying the feshbach formalism to a subspace that contains both the scattering of a particle on top of the nuclear core and the possibility of propagating a hole excitation  @xcite .",
    "the resulting optical potential simply reduces to the usual many - body self - energy .",
    "the properties of this particular choice of the optical model have been reviewed by mahaux and sartor  @xcite .",
    "the above considerations suggest that the technique of using many - body green s function can make reasonable predictions for nucleon - nucleus scattering .",
    "however , most of its applications in nuclear physics have focused on the the study of nuclear correlations  @xcite . in this contribution , we consider the self - energy resulting from a recent application of the self - consistent green s function method the nucleus of @xmath0o  @xcite and explore its predictions for proton - nucleus scattering .",
    "in refs .",
    "@xcite , the nuclear self - energy was computed within a model space @xmath3 corresponding to the harmonic oscillator states of all orbitals up to the @xmath4 shell plus the @xmath5 orbital .",
    "a parameter @xmath6=1.76  fm was employed and a g - matrix interaction based on the bonn - c potential  @xcite was used in the calculation . when expressed in coordinate space",

    "we note that this choice for the space @xmath3 is adequate to study properties of the nuclear interior when considering low energy ( long range ) excitations and accounting for the spectral fragmentation  @xcite",

    "the remaining diagrams are usually referred as core polarization contributions  @xcite .",
    "they were computed in ref .",
    "@xcite by including the coupling of single particle motion ( i.e. quasiparticles and quasiholes ) to different types of collective motion , namely excitations of the a - particle core , two - particle and two - hole states . at low enough energies",

    "thus , eq .  ( [ eq : self - en ] ) gives us a model for the optical potential that acts in the full single particle hilbert space .",
    "however , before using it in practical applications one has to correct for the fact that the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite did not include the electromagnetic interaction and were based on a two - body realistic interaction , which is not sufficient to account for spin - orbit splitting .",
    "hence , in this work we augment the self - energy  ( [ eq : self - en ] ) with the coulomb potential for a uniformly charged sphere of radius @xmath13  =  3.2  fm and add a correction @xmath14 .",
