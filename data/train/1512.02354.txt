    "<S> proton spin is investigated in chiral effective field theory through an examination of the singlet axial charge , @xmath0 , and the two non - singlet axial charges , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> finite - range regularization is considered as it provides an effective model for estimating the role of disconnected sea - quark loop contributions to baryon observables . </S>",
    "<S> baryon octet and decuplet intermediate states are included to enrich the spin and flavour structure of the nucleon , redistributing spin under the constraints of chiral symmetry . in this context , the proton spin puzzle is well understood with the calculation describing all three of the axial charges reasonably well . </S>",
    "<S> the strange quark contribution to the proton spin is negative with magnitude 0.01 . with appropriate @xmath3 evolution , we find the singlet axial charge at the experimental scale to be @xmath4 , consistent with the range of current experimental values .    </S>",
    "<S> adp-15 - 48/t950    in 1988 the european muon collaboration ( emc ) published their polarized deep inelastic measurement of the proton s spin dependent structure function @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> their result suggested that the quark spins summed over the up , down and strange quark flavors contribute only a small fraction of the proton s spin  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the emc data shocked the particle physics community , because it was thought to be contradictory to the apparently successful , naive quark model descriptions of proton structure where the constituent quarks carry the total proton spin . </S>",
    "<S> it inspired a vigorous global program of experimental and theoretical developments to understand the internal spin structure of the proton extending for nearly three decades . </S>",
    "<S> for reviews of the spin structure of the proton , see for example refs .  .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental efforts at cern  @xcite , desy  @xcite , jlab  @xcite , rhic  @xcite and slac  @xcite have been impressive . a summary of the status and recent experimental results on the spin structure of the nucleon can be found in ref .  @xcite . unlike the early emc result which suggested that the quark spin contribution , @xmath6 , might be consistent with zero ( @xmath7  @xcite ) , today the experimental measurements indicate the nucleon s flavor - singlet axial charge measured in polarized deep inelastic scattering is @xmath8 at @xmath9 gev@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this tends to about one - third of the total spin @xmath11 as @xmath12 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the matrix elements of the non - singlet axial current @xmath13 and the singlet axial current @xmath14 are defined as follows @xmath15 where @xmath16 are generators of the flavor group and @xmath17 is a vector in flavor space . </S>",
    "<S> the singlet axial current is not conserved due to the adler - bell - jackiw anomaly . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the flavor - singlet matrix element can receive an additional contribution from gluon polarization  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this led to the early idea that the measured singlet component @xmath0 receives an important contribution from the gluon polarization @xmath18 , _ i.e. _ @xmath19 the polarized gluon distribution function @xmath18 was estimated to be less than 0.3 at a scale of 1 gev@xmath20 in the mit bag model  @xcite . from the extensive experimental studies one finds that the absolute value is of the order @xmath21 0.2 - 0.3 for @xmath3 = 3 gev@xmath20  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this amount of gluon polarization , by itself , is far too small to resolve the problem of the small value of @xmath6 through the axial anomaly .    </S>",
    "<S> another explanation for the small value of @xmath6 draws on the strange quark contribution to the proton spin . the non - singlet axial charge @xmath2 extracted from hyperon beta </S>",
    "<S> - decays under the assumption of @xmath22 flavour symmetry is @xmath23  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the strange quark contribution to the proton spin were around @xmath24 , the proton spin , @xmath6 , expressed as @xmath25 @xmath26 , would be close to the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> however , the uncertainty of @xmath2 could be as large as @xmath27 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a recent re - evaluation of the nucleon s axial - charges in the cloudy bag model , taking into account the effect of the one - gluon - exchange hyperfine interaction and the meson cloud , led to the value @xmath28 @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath29 was found to be of order 0.01 in magnitude ( and negative ) , with the small value of @xmath2 a consequence of su(3 ) breaking .    soon after the release of the emc data it was realized that the effect of the pion cloud of the nucleon , associated with chiral symmetry breaking , would be to lower the quark spin content of the nucleon  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is because pion emission tends to flip the nucleon spin and hence the spins of the quarks in it , while the quarks in the pion necessarily carry orbital angular momentum but no spin . </S>",
    "<S> this effect was calculated in the cloudy bag model and the effect of the pion cloud together with the relativistic motion of the light quarks in the bag  @xcite reduced @xmath6 to around 0.5 . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative approach to the problem recognised that , given the standard spin dependent one - gluon - exchange correction to the energy of the nucleon , there must be a corresponding exchange current correction to the proton spin  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this too reduces the proton spin by around 0.15 below the naive bag model result of 0.65 . </S>",
    "<S> it is only recently that studies of the @xmath30 nucleon mass splitting in lattice qcd  @xcite provided the justification for combining the pion cloud and one - gluon exchange effects  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this led to a theoretical result in the range @xmath31 to @xmath32 , which is compatible with the aforementioned experimental value and , after qcd evolution , with the results of lattice qcd for the angular momentum carried by the quarks in the proton  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the scale dependence of @xmath0 presents another consideration in understanding the fraction of the proton spin carried by quarks  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consideration of the genral features of qcd evolution long ago led to the conclusion that the natural scale at which to match a quark model to qcd is quite low , so that most of the momentum of the proton is carried by valence quarks and one can think of the gluons as having been integrated out of the theory . in jaffe s scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the small value of the experimental proton spin is due to differences in the energy scale of the experimental result and the quark model results . </S>",
    "<S> since the anomalous dimension of the singlet axial current is nontrivial , its matrix element @xmath0 is scale dependent . with the @xmath3 evolution , </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that the large proton spin at low @xmath3 will be reduced through @xmath3 evolution to the large @xmath3 of the experimental result . as mentioned in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , it is difficult to get a reliable evolution at low-@xmath3 because perturbative qcd is not applicable . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , one can not determine which evolution line presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is correct . </S>",
    "<S> one needs a direct calculation of @xmath6 at the low energy scale .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we will investigate the proton spin carried by the quarks in the framework of effective field theory , assuming that at the corresponding low scale the gluons have been integrated out , with the only residue being a spin - dependent effective interaction between quarks . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 , and the non - singlet axial charges @xmath1 and @xmath2 will be calculated simultaneously in the chiral effective field theory . in this approach </S>",
    "<S> the proton structure is enhanced through the dressing of the proton by octet - meson and both octet and decuplet baryon intermediate states . </S>",
    "<S> these processes enrich the spin and flavour structure of the nucleon , redistributing spin under the constraints of chiral symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> as we will see , this formalism is able to describe all three axial charges in a reasonable manner .    </S>",

    "<S> hogaason and myhrer  @xcite showed that the incorporation of the exchange current correction arising from the effective one - gluon - exchange ( oge ) force shifts the tree - level non - singlet charge , @xmath1 , from @xmath90 to @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is about 0.05 . </S>",
