    "our bad - pixel screening removed @xmath34% of all events . when cleaning background events , we set check_vf_pha = yes in acis_process_events for observations taken in very faint mode to utilize a @xmath35 pixel event island to search for potential cosmic - ray background events , which typically removes of the events of individual observations .",

    "while following the general procedure described in   3 of l08 in the production of our source catalogs ,",
    "we extensively made use of the acis extract ( ae ; version released on 2010 february 26 ; broos et  al .",

    "significant improvements from the methodology of l08 include , e.g. , ( 1 ) utilization of ae polygonal source - count extraction regions that approximate the shape of the psf and take into account the multi - observation nature of the data , and ( 2 ) utilization of a two - stage approach to source detection , which filters candidate sources according to binomial no - source probabilities ( i.e. , probabilities of sources not being real considering their local backgrounds ) calculated by ae .",
    "we first generated a candidate - list catalog of sources detected by wavdetect ( freeman et  al .",
    "2002 ) on the combined images ( see   [ sec : list ] ) at a false - positive probability threshold of @xmath1 .",

    "[ sec : list ] , we are able to lock the absolute astrometry of the _ combined _ images to the vla radio catalog because of the larger number of sources detected .",

    "it then computes local background counts within background regions that subtract contributions from the source and its neighboring sources . in our ae usage ,",

    ", this algorithm produces essentially the same background - extraction results as the traditional ae `` extract_backgrounds '' algorithm ; the latter algorithm computes local background counts by masking all the sources and then searching around each source for the smallest circular region that contains a desired number of background counts .",
    "ae analyzes individual observations independently ( including , e.g. , the use of marx for psf modeling and source and background extractions ) and merges the data to produce photometry for each source .",

    "ae estimates an energy - dependent aperture correction for each source and applies the correction to the effective area calibration file used for spectral modeling . for this work , we chose to apply aperture corrections to the background - subtracted photometry as follows .",
    "for the soft ( hard ) band , we derived an effective psf fraction for each source by weighting psf measurements at 1.497 ( 4.510 )  kev by the exposures for the individual observations . given that the full band is a combination of the soft and hard bands , we derived the full - band effective psf fraction based on the derived soft - band and hard - band effective psf fractions : ( 1 ) if a source was detected both in the soft and hard bands , we derived the full - band effective psf fraction by weighting the soft and hard - band effective psf fractions with the soft and hard - band background - subtracted counts ; ( 2 ) if a source was detected in the soft or hard band ( but not both ) , we set the full - band effective psf fraction to the soft or hard band effective psf fraction , respectively ; and ( 3 ) if a source was detected in neither the soft band nor the hard band , we took the average of the soft and hard band effective psf fractions as the full - band effective psf fraction .",
    "the median aperture corrections for the full , soft , and hard bands are 0.875 , 0.898 , and 0.826 , respectively .",
    "we then applied aperture corrections by dividing the background - subtracted source counts by the derived effective psf fractions . since our candidate - list catalog was constructed using wavdetect with a liberal false - positive probability threshold of @xmath1 , many candidate sources have ( background - subtracted ) source counts . in the next section ,",
    "we evaluate the reliability of candidate sources on a source - by - source basis to produce a more robust main source catalog .",
    "as discussed above , we expect our candidate - list catalog of 892 sources to include a significant number of false sources since we ran wavdetect at a liberal false - positive probability threshold of @xmath1 .",
    "if we conservatively treat the three standard - band images as independent , we can estimate the number of expected false sources in the candidate - list catalog for the case of a uniform background by multiplying the wavdetect threshold of @xmath1 by the sum of pixels in the three bands ( i.e. , ) .",
    "however , such a false - source estimate is conservative , since over the majority of the field , a single pixel will not be considered a source - detection cell .",
    "in particular , at large off - axis angles wavdetect suppresses fluctuations on scales smaller than the psf . as quantified in ",
    "3.4.1 of a03 , the number of false - sources is likely times smaller than the above conservative estimate .",
    "we refer readers to   [ sec : comprel ] for relevant discussions .",
    "to produce a more reliable main  source catalog , we evaluated for each source the binomial probability @xmath79 that no source exists given the measurements of the source and local background .",
    "as discussed in   5.10.3 of the ae manual ( also see appendix  a2 of weisskopf et  al .",
    "2007 for further details ) , the binomial no - source probability @xmath79 can be calculated using the following equation : @xmath80 in this equation , @xmath81 is the total number of counts in the source - extraction region without subtraction of the background counts @xmath82 in this region ; @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the total extracted background counts within a background - extraction region that is typically a factor of @xmath78 larger than the source - extraction region in our ae usage ( see   [ sec : list ] ) ; and @xmath85 is the probability that a photon lies in the source - extraction region ( thus contributing to @xmath81 ) , where @xmath86 with a typical value of @xmath78 , as stated earlier .",
    "@xmath79 is computed by ae in each of the three standard bands . for a source to be included in our main catalog , we required @xmath87 in at least one of the three standard bands .",
    "we identified multiwavelength counterparts for the sources ( see   [ sec : id ] ) and studied the identification rate as a function of the @xmath79 value , given that sources without identifications in ultradeep multiwavelength data are more likely to be false detections ( see , e.g. , l10 ) .",
    "the requirement of @xmath87 was empirically chosen as a compromise to keep the fraction of potential false sources small while recovering the largest number of real sources . using this criterion of @xmath88 ,",
    "our main catalog contains a total of 740 sources .",
    "we note that for a different choice of source - detection criterion of @xmath89 , a total of 33 additional sources with @xmath90 would be included ; however , only @xmath91 ( i.e. , 21 ) of these 33 sources have multiwavelength counterparts , as opposed to an identification rate of @xmath5 for the main catalog ( see   [ sec : id ] ) .",
    "we refer readers to   [ sec : comprel ] for a detailed discussion on the completeness and reliability of the main catalog based on simulations .",
    "our adopted cataloging procedure , with the utilization of ae , has a number of advantages over a `` traditional '' wavdetect - only approach : ( 1 ) the more detailed treatment of complex source - extraction regions ( i.e. , using polygonal regions , as opposed to elliptical apertures , to simulate the psf ) that is more suitable for the case of multiple observations with different aim points and roll angles , ( 2 ) the better source - position determination that maximizes the signal - to - noise ratio and leads to more accurate count estimates , ( 3 ) the more careful background estimates that take into account the effects of all the neighboring sources and ccd gaps , and ( 4 ) the more immediately transparent mathematical criterion ( i.e. , the binomial probability ) that is utilized for source detection",
    ". we will demonstrate below that our adopted procedure recovers almost all of the sources detected with wavdetect at a false - positive probability threshold of @xmath39 and a significant number of additional real sources detected at @xmath1 .    in order to give a more detailed wavdetect - based perspective on source significance",

    "we note that a larger net gain of sources could be achieved if we adopted a less conservative no - source probability cut ( e.g. , @xmath89 ) at the expense of introducing more spurious sources .",

    "<S> we present source catalogs for the 4  ms  deep field - south ( ) , which is the deepest  survey to date and covers an area of 464.5 arcmin@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a main  source catalog , which contains 740 sources that are detected with wavdetect at a false - positive probability threshold of @xmath1 in at least one of three bands ( , full band ; , soft band ; and , hard band ) and also satisfy a binomial - probability source - selection criterion of ( i.e. , the probability of sources not being real is less than 0.004 ) ; this approach is designed to maximize the number of reliable sources detected . </S>",
    "<S> a total of 300 main - catalog sources are new compared to the previous 2  ms main - catalog sources . </S>",
    "<S> we determine source positions using centroid and matched - filter techniques and obtain a median positional uncertainty of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide a supplementary catalog , which consists of 36 sources that are detected with wavdetect at a false - positive probability threshold of @xmath1 , satisfy the condition of @xmath3 , and have an optical counterpart with @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> multiwavelength identifications , basic optical / infrared / radio photometry , and spectroscopic / photometric redshifts are provided for the sources in the main and supplementary catalogs . </S>",
    "<S> 716 ( @xmath5 ) of the 740 main - catalog sources have multiwavelength counterparts , with 673 ( @xmath6 of 716 ) having either spectroscopic or photometric redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> the 740 main - catalog sources span broad ranges of full - band flux and luminosity ; the 300 new main - catalog sources span similar ranges although they tend to be systematically lower . </S>",
    "<S> basic analyses of the and multiwavelength properties of the sources indicate that @xmath7 of the main - catalog sources are agns ; of the 300 new main - catalog sources , about 35% are likely normal and starburst galaxies , reflecting the rise of normal and starburst galaxies at the very faint flux levels uniquely accessible to the 4  ms . near the center of the 4  ms ( i.e. , within an off - axis angle of  @xmath8 ) </S>",
    "<S> , the observed agn and galaxy source densities have reached @xmath9  deg@xmath10 and @xmath11  deg@xmath10 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> simulations show that our main catalog is highly reliable and is reasonably complete . </S>",
    "<S> the mean backgrounds ( corrected for vignetting and exposure - time variations ) are 0.063 and 0.178 count  ms@xmath12  pixel@xmath12 ( for a pixel size of @xmath13 ) for the soft and hard bands , respectively ; the majority of the pixels have zero background counts . </S>",
