    "the adiabatic - connection fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( acfdt ) provides an exact representation of the electronic correlation energy in term of the interacting density response function , within density functional theory ( dft).@xcite a major advantage of this method , is that it naturally accounts for dispersive interactions through the non - locality of the response function .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to semi - local approximations , the acfdt correlation energy is naturally combined with the exact exchange energy and does not rely on error cancellation between the exchange and correlation contributions to the total energy .",
    "the accuracy of correlation energies within the acfdt , then depends on the quality of the interacting response function which needs to be approximated .",
    "the most famous approximation for the response function is the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , which is obtained when a non - interacting approximation is used for the irreducible polarizability . for metallic systems ,",
    "the rpa provides a qualitative account of screening in and cures the pathological divergence of second order perturbation theory for the homogeneous electron gas . in 2001",
    "furche@xcite applied rpa and acfdt to obtain the dissociation energies of small molecules and found that the results were slightly worse than those obtained with a generalized gradient approximation@xcite ( gga ) with a systematic tendency to underbind .",
    "it was also shown that rpa can account for strong static correlation and correctly reproduces the dissociation limit of the n@xmath0 molecule .",
    "following this , rpa has been applied to calculate cohesive energies of solids@xcite and again , rpa performs significantly worse than gga with a systematic tendency to underbind .",
    "in contrast , rpa produces excellent results for van der waals bonded systems like graphite@xcite , which is very poorly described by semi - local approximations .",
    "in addition , for graphene adsorbed on metal surfaces , where both covalent and dispersive interactions are equally important , the rpa seems to be the only non - fitted scheme capable of describing the potential energy curves correctly.@xcite    by now , it is well established that rpa provides a reliable account of van der waals bonded systems but systematically underestimates the strength of covalent and ionic bonds.@xcite furthermore , the absolute correlation energies obtained with rpa are severely underestimated and dissociation energies benefit from huge error cancellations . in particular , for one - electron systems rpa gives rise to a substantial negative correlation energy .",
    "this large self - correlation error can be remedied by subtracting the local rpa error obtained from the homogeneous electron gas,@xcite but unfortunately the procedure does not improve upon dissociation energies of molecules and solids.@xcite a more sophisticated approach is to add a second order screened exchange ( sosex ) contribution to the correlation energy , which exactly cancels the self - correlation energy for one - electron systems .",
    "this approach has been shown to improve dissociation energies of molecules@xcite and cohesive energies of solids@xcite , but is significantly more computationally demanding than rpa .",
    "in addition the sosex term in the correlation energy destroys the good description of static correlation in rpa and produces the wrong dissociation limit of small molecules.@xcite    in a different line of development , time - dependent density functional theory@xcite ( tddft ) provides a systematic way to improve the rpa response function . here",
    "the response function can be expressed in terms of a frequency - dependent non - local exchange - correlation kernel and rpa is obtained when the kernel is neglected .",
    "a rather advanced approach in this direction , is the inclusion of the frequency - dependent exact exchange kernel , which has been shown to produce very accurate dissociation energies of small molecules@xcite and conserve the accurate description of static correlation characteristic of rpa.@xcite while this method is considerably more involved than rpa , it provides evidence that accurate correlation energies may be obtained from tddft and acfdt with a good approximation for the exchange kernel . in ref .",
    "[ ] the correlation energy of the homogeneous electron gas was evaluated using different approximations for the exchange - correlation kernel and the results indicated that the frequency dependence of the kernel is of minor importance , while the non - locality of the kernel is crucial .",
    "moreover , it has been shown by furche and van voorhis@xcite that any local approximation for the kernel produces a correlation hole , which diverges at the origin .",
    "the resulting correlation energies then often become worse than those obtained with rpa ( one exception to this is the local energy - optimized kernel of ref .",
    "whereas exchange - correlation kernels have traditionally been derived to produce accurate excited state properties , there is now a considerable interest in obtaining exchange - correlation kernels suited for accurate ground state correlation energies.@xcite in this respect , it is interesting to note that the optical properties of electronic systems are ill described with local approximations for the kernel due to wrong behavior at @xmath1 , while the failure for total energy calculations originate from the bad behavior in the limit @xmath2 ( see discussion below ) .    in this paper",
    "we present a parameter - free renormalized adiabatic exchange kernel .",
    "the renormalization introduces non - locality in the kernel and provides an accurate description of the correlation hole at short distances , which gives rise to a better description of short - range correlation compared to rpa .",
    "we note that the philosophy of the renormalization is similar to the smooth cutoff introduced in the energy - optimized kernel of ref .",
    "however , in contrast to that kernel , the present kernel does not contain any fitted parameters .",
    "the kernel has previously been shown to improve upon rpa for absolute correlation energies and dissociation energies of small molecules@xcite , while the computational load is comparable to rpa . here",
    "we describe the theory and implementation in detail and assess the performance for cohesive energies of solids , static correlation and van der waals interactions .",

    "it is standard practice to divide @xmath9 into an exchange part @xmath10 obtained by setting @xmath11 in the integrand and a correlation part @xmath12 , which is the remainder .",

    "a major advantage of this separation is that the exchange energy only depends on the occupied bands and can be converged separately with respect to @xmath15-points plane wave cutoff , etc .",
    "one can then focus on the correlation energy @xmath12 , which can be calculated once an approximation for @xmath16 has been given .    to obtain @xmath16",

    "all the complicated correlation effects contained in @xmath20 has been transferred into @xmath18 , which needs to be approximated . however , even if @xmath18 is neglected all together , one still obtains a non - trivial approximation for @xmath20 due to the coulomb interaction term .",
    "this is the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .    to obtain correlation energies beyond the random phase approximation",
    ", we will include an approximation for @xmath18 in eq . .",
    "in general , one can obtain the exchange - correlation kernel along the adiabatic connection from the scaling properties @xcite @xmath21(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r'},\\omega)&=\\lambda^2f_{xc}[n'](\\lambda\\mathbf{r},\\lambda\\mathbf{r'},\\omega/\\lambda^2),\\\\ n'&=\\lambda^{-3}n(\\mathbf{r}/\\lambda),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and it will thus be sufficient to consider the case of @xmath22 . due to the first order nature of exchange ,",
    "any properly derived pure exchange kernel should have the property that @xmath23(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r'},\\omega)=\\lambda f_{x}[n](\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r'},\\omega)$ ] .",
    "for a pure exchange kernel the coupling constant integration can thus be carried out resulting in @xmath24\\notag\\\\ & + v\\chi^{ks}(i\\omega)]\\big\\},\\label{e_c_int}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 . however , the inversion of @xmath26 turns out to cause numerical problems and for _ ab initio _ applications in this manuscript we will perform the coupling constant integration numerically .",
    "a simple and natural choice is the adiabatic local density approximation ( alda ) given in the frequency domain by @xmath27(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r'})&=\\delta(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r'})f^{\\text{alda}}_{xc}[n(\\mathbf{r})],\\label{alda1}\\\\ f^{\\text{alda}}_{xc}[n(\\mathbf{r})]&=\\frac{d^2}{dn^2}\\big(n\\varepsilon_{xc}^{heg}\\big)\\big|_{n = n(\\mathbf{r})},\\label{alda2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the exchange - correlation energy per electron in the homogeneous electron gas .",
    "the approximation is in a certain sense similar to lda in static dft , but in contrast to lda , the alda is not exact for the homogeneous electron gas .",
    "in particular , the alda kernel becomes a ( density dependent ) constant in the homogeneous electron gas , while the true kernel should depend on both frequencies and position differences .",
    "this means that alda can violate a number of exact conditions .",
    "for example , it is well known that the kernel in fourier space should behave as @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath29 for @xmath2 , @xcite which are obviously violated by any local kernel .",
    "whereas , the first of these conditions is very important for the description of optical excitations within tddft , it is the second condition , which makes any local approximation @xmath31 useless for total energy calculations in the acfdt framework .",
    "the reason is that the trace in eq . becomes an integral over all @xmath32 and an inaccurate description of the response function at large @xmath33 ,",
    "can deteriorate the correlation energy completely .",
    "equivalently , the constant behavior of @xmath31 at large @xmath33 renders the pair correlation function in real - space divergent at the origin .",
    "this divergence is integrable , but gives rise to severe convergence problems for _ ab initio _",
    "applications.@xcite    to show this in more detail we have plotted the correlation hole of the homogeneous electron gas in the top row of fig .",
    "[ fig : g_q ] using rpa and the exchange part of the alda ( alda@xmath34 ) approximation for @xmath31 and compare with an analytic representation.@xcite the analytic representation has been shown to agree with monte carlo simulations and here we will regard this as the exact correlation hole .",
    "the correlation energy per electron is directly related to the integral of the coupling constant averaged correlation hole @xmath35 : @xmath36 it is most instructive to look at the correlation hole in @xmath33-space .",
    "it is seen that the rpa hole decays to slowly and since the correlation energy is proportional to the integral of the correlation hole , is is clear that rpa will overestimate the magnitude of the correlation energy .",
    "in fact , the correlation energy per electron becomes @xmath37 ev too negative for a wide range of densities , whereas the relative error increases from @xmath38 at @xmath39 to @xmath40 at @xmath41.@xcite .",
    "alda@xmath34 , on the other hand , seems to reproduce the @xmath33-space representation of the correlation hole much better .",
    "however , at large @xmath33 , the correlation hole acquires a slowly decaying positive tail and as a consequence , the correlation energy becomes too large by @xmath42 ev per electron .",
    "furthermore , the slowly decaying tail introduces a divergence at the origin in the real space correlation hole .",
    "we note that the results change very little if we include the full alda ( exchange + correlation ) kernel .",
    "if we are mostly concerned with total correlation energies , we may observe that the exact correlation hole picks up most of its weight between zero and @xmath43 where @xmath44 has a zero - point .",
    "the correlation energy is then approximated by @xmath45 and we have previously shown that this procedure yields correlation energies within 30 mev of the exact value for a wide range of densities @xcite . we can now proceed to define a new real space correlation hole obtained by fourier transforming @xmath44 truncated at @xmath43 and we will refer to this as ralda@xmath34 . from fig .

    "the spin structure is then very similar to that of the alda hartree exchange , the only difference being that we have replaced the bare coulomb interaction with the renormalized coulomb interaction and the alda kernel has been replaced by @xmath75 , where both are evaluated on the total density .",
    "we note that this choice is by no means unique and in our previous work@xcite we used the expression @xmath76\\delta_{\\sigma\\sigma'}+v^r[n_\\sigma+n_{\\sigma'}]-v$ ] .",
    "however we have found that eq .",
    "gives better results for atomization energies and we have used that approximation in the present work .      it is straightforward to generalize the ralda kernel eq . to inhomogeneous systems by taking @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",

    "we will use two different flavors of the two - point density : @xmath82 and @xmath83 the first of these choices is a simple average of the densities . in our view , this is the most natural choice since the two - point density should give the width of the kernel , if we regard this as a pure function of @xmath84 .",
    "thus if @xmath85 and @xmath86 belong to two well separated systems , the coupling originating from the kernel is determined by the width , which should be given by the average value of the densities at @xmath85 and @xmath86 . from the dyson equation",

    "this version of the two - point density is therefore not expected to describe van der waals interactions correctly , but it has the great advantage that the kernel becomes a function of @xmath91 and @xmath92 , which simplifies calculations in periodic systems .",

    "the frequency integration is performed using 16 gauss - legendre points with the highest point situated at 800 ev .    the kernel eq .",
    "with a general two - point density like eq .",
    "is only invariant under simultaneous lattice translation in @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",

    "a consistent approach is to sample a set of unit cells , which matches the sampled @xmath15-point grid . since , the sum in eq .",
    "only involves lattice point differences , a lot of terms are equal and we can reduce the double sum over lattice points to a sum over lattice point differences , where each term is weighted by the number of times that particular lattice point difference appears . despite this reduction , the evaluation of the ralda kernel for periodic systems still represents a major computational load , since we have to calculate the full two - point function @xmath104 for each lattice point difference .      one way to circumvent the lattice point sampling for periodic systems ,",
    "is to replace the general two - point density eq . by the density at the average position eq . .",

    "the most striking improvement of the ralda functional compared to rpa , is the accurate description of absolute correlation energies .",
    "the main motivation for the method is the accurate representation of the correlation energy of the heg and in ref .",

    "cohesive energies of solids are then discussed and the two methods presented in eqs . and are compared .",
    "we then present c@xmath113 coefficients of eight atoms evaluated with lda , rpa and ralda .",
    "finally , we demonstrate that the ralda method becomes very similar to rpa in the description of long range correlation , which we exemplify by the dissociation of a graphene bilayer and the binding energy of four molecular dimers .      the calculation of rpa and ralda correlation energies are performed in three steps .",
    "first a standard lda calculation is carried out in a plane wave basis . the full plane wave kohn - sham hamiltonian is diagonalized to obtain all unoccupied electronic states and eigenvalues .",
    "finally , we choose a cutoff energy and calculate the kohn - sham response where we put the number of unoccupied bands equal to the number of plane waves defined by the cutoff and evaluate the correlation energy according to eqs . and .",
    "the calculated correlation energies are added to non - selfconsistent hartree - fock energies evaluated on the same orbitals as the correlation energy . in general",
    ", we have found very little dependence on the input orbitals for hartree - fock energies .",
    "all lda and pbe calculations were performed with a 600 ev cutoff for the wavefunctions . for rpa and ralda energies we use an additional cutoff , which in general is smaller than the wavefunction cutoff and",
    "defines the number of plane wave used to represent the response function .",
    "the calculations are challenging to converge with respect to this cutoff energy and for most calculations we have used an extrapolation scheme to obtain converged results . for sufficiently high cutoff energies the correlation energy is found to scale as@xcite @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the converged result . for most",
    "considered systems the extrapolation was found to be very accurate when the cutoff is increased beyond 300 ev .",
    "typically , the converged results are obtained by extrapolating correlation energies in the range 250 - 400 ev .",
    "when comparing systems with similar electronic structure in the same unit cell , energy differences converge much faster and in the case of a bilayer graphene we used a fixed cutoff of 200 ev to calculate the potential energy curve .",
    "the ralda kernel is evaluated on a real space grid where the grid spacing is set to @xmath116 .",
    "we have checked that ralda results are converged with respect to this grid spacing which is always on the order @xmath117  when the wavefunction cutoff energy is 600 ev ( see appendix a ) .",

    "rpa gives a binding energy of 25 mev and an equilibrium distance of 3.39  , whereas ralda gives a binding energy of 22 mev and an equilibrium distance of 3.45  .",
    "we should note that the binding energy curves were obtained by fitting a rather rough set of interlayer distances and more accurate results would require more accurate sampling of the binding energy curve .",
    "the rpa and ralda curves coincide a large distances and decay slower than the tail of the curve obtained with the van der waals functional .    in general rpa",
    "has a tendency to underbind and the reduced binding energy of ralda compared to rpa could imply that ralda actually performs worse than rpa in this case .",
    "however , in the case of graphite , rpa seems to produce the exact binding energy between layers@xcite and it is not clear if rpa is also expected to underbind in this case .",
    "furthermore , rpa and ralda seems to give identical results for the few s22 dimers and while we do not have accurate experimental data for the binding energy and equilibrium distance of bilayer graphene , fig .",
    "[ fig : bilayer ] merely serves to illustrate the applicability and similarity of rpa and ralda for the description of long range dispersive interactions .",
    "we have assessed the performance of a non - local adiabatic kernel ( ralda ) for electronic correlation energies . for atomization energies of small molecules and cohesive energies of insulators and metals , the kernel performs significantly better than rpa .",
    "we have found inclusion of semi - core states is crucial for the description of transition metals at the rpa and ralda level .",
    "for the small molecules , we also obtain better agreement with experiments than the sosex extension to rpa .",
    "the method preserves ( but does not improve ) the good description of static correlation and dispersive interactions , which is the main merit of rpa .",
    "the kernel also improves the description of c@xmath113 coefficients compared to rpa .    in our opinion ,",
    "a major advantage of the present approach is the unique choice of input orbitals and eigenvalues , which should match the adiabatic ( renormalized ) kernel . while lda orbitals may not be the most accurate choice for evaluating the kohn - sham response function , it is satisfactory that we do not have to make an arbitrary choice , which can have a severe influence on the results . from the point of view of tddft",
    ", rpa corresponds to the time - dependent hartree approximation and a consistent choice in that case would be to adopt hartree orbitals and eigenvalues",
    ". however , this would be a very bad starting point and rpa calculations are usually performed on top of semilocal dft orbitals or hartree - fock orbitals . in this sense , the non - selfconsistent ralda calculations represent a more complete and consistent scheme than non - selfconsistent rpa .",
    "the computational cost of the method is larger than rpa , but certainly cheaper than time - dependent exact exchange or sosex .",
    "the main differences compared to rpa is the evaluation of the renormalized non - local kernel . for non - periodic systems",
    "this evaluation does not comprise a major extension of the computational time compared to rpa .",
    "for the cohesive energies of solids a large unit cell sampling is required to converge results and the calculations are somewhat more time - consuming than rpa . on the other hand for bilayer graphene , the potential energy surfaces are converged with a unit cell sampling of 4 adjacent cell and the computational cost of ralda is just 20 % extra compared to rpa .",
    "the cohesive energies of solids are important for an assessment of the method , but for future application to larger systems ( for example molecular adsorption or reaction barriers at metal surfaces ) the calculations will be dominated by the evaluation of the repsonse function and the computational cost becomes comparable to rpa . compared to rpa , another complication is the spin - dependence of the kernel , which forces us to solve the full spin - dependent dyson equation instead of working with spin - summed quantities . in our plane wave implementation , this leads to memory problems for spin - polarized systems when considering large unit cells and high cutoff energies . finally , the coupling constant integration is carried out numerically due to near - singular behavior of the kernel . however , this problem is very likely to originate from the plane - wave representation of the kernel and a different implementation could probably solve this problem and apply the analytic result .    in the present paper",
    "we have only discussed the renormalized alda kernel .",
    "however , it should be straightforward to generalize this to a renormalized adiabatic pbe kernel or in fact , any semi - local exchange kernel",
    ". we would expect this to improve results further due to more accurate initial orbitals and eigenvalues and because the kernel would then contain gradient corrections , which are likely to improve the description of the interacting response function .",
    "the cutoff scheme thus implies an entire hierarchy of renormalized adiabatic kernels for correlation energy calculations .",
    "one caveat , is the fact that many semi - local approximations to the exchange correlation energy work well due to error cancellation between exchange and correlation and it is possible that one would have to include the correlation part of the kernel as well , in order to obtain highly accurate results .",
    "this would , however , be straightforward and one would simply have to evaluate the full kernel explicitly along the adiabatic connection since the linear scaling of pure exchange is lost .",
    "it would also be very interesting to compare the present results , with those obtained with the fitted non - local kernel of ref .",
    "@xcite , which is defined by a similar cuf off procedure .",
    "we will leave these issues to future work .",
    "the two - point kernel eq .",
    "is evaluated using a density , which is represented on a real space grid .",
    "we have not been able to derive an explicit paw correction for the kernel , and have used the all - electron density for calculations in this work . since the all - electron density varies rapidly in the core region of atoms , it is not obvious that it is possible to converge the kernel with respect to grid spacing .",
    "however , the alda exchange kernel approaches zero for large densities and as it turns out , the rapidly oscillating core region does not contribute much to the ralda kernel .",
    "this is illustarted in fig .",
    "[ fig : n2_grid ] where the correlation energy of an n@xmath0 molecule is plotted for decreasing grid spacing .",
    "the energy difference ( contribution to the atomization energy ) converges rapidly and is accurate to within 10 mev at 0.17  .",
    "this is the value used for all calculations in the present work and is close to the default value of 0.18  in gpaw .",
    "the correlation energy of a single n atom is also close to convergence at this value , whereas a slightly smaller grid spacing is required for n@xmath0 .        for the molecular and atomic systems in this work we have obtained the plane wave representation of the ralda kernel by evaluating the full hartree - exchange kernel in real space and performing a numerical fourier transform @xmath118(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}')+v^r[n](\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}')\\big].\\ ] ] in a single unit cell .",
    "this results in a truncation on the kernel whenever @xmath85 or @xmath86 is outside the unit cell , which means that the system will not interact with its periodic images .",
    "another major advantage of this approach is that the full hartree - exchange kernel is finite for @xmath119 eq . , which is not true for the bare exchange kernel eq . .    for solids , however , it is important to take into account the long range nature of the coulomb interaction .",
    "the renormalized coulomb interaction @xmath120 approaches the bare coulomb interaction when @xmath55 and it becomes difficult to converge the fourier transform of this with respect to the number of sampled unit cells . for periodic systems , we therefore only represent the exchange part of the kernel in real space and add the exact fourier transform of the hartree kernel : @xmath121,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath122 .",

    "exhibits convergence behavior very similar to rpa , which means that the convergence is largely governed by brillouin zone sampling of kohn - sham states .",
    "in contrast , the implementation eq .",

    "we also show the difference between the two methods , which slowly approaches zero in the limit of @xmath107",
    ". however , the bare exchange kernel diverges for @xmath119 , and this divergence is represented by a spherical average around a single grid point , which make the calculations converge slightly slower with respect to grid spacing .",
