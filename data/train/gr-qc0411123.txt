    "in einstein s theory of general relativity , linearization of the field equations shows that small perturbations of the metric obey a wave equation ( misner , thorne & wheeler 1973 ) .",
    "these small disturbances , referred to as gravitational waves , travel at the speed of light .",
    "however , some other gravity theories predict a dispersive propagation ( see @xcite for references ) . the most commonly considered form of dispersion supposes that the waves obey a klein  gordan type equation : @xmath0 \\psi = 0.\\ ] ] physically , the dispersive term is ascribed to the quantum of gravitation having a non - zero rest mass @xmath1 , or equivalently a non - infinite compton wavelength @xmath2 .",
    "the group velocity of propagation for a wave of frequency @xmath3 is then @xmath4,\\ ] ] valid for @xmath5 ; only in the infinite frequency limit is general relativity recovered , with waves traveling at the speed of light @xcite .    over the past few decades a number of different _",
    "dynamic _ tests of this dispersive hypothesis have been described , i.e. tests making use of direct observations of gravitational waves or their radiation reaction effects @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we add another method to this list ; we consider gravitational radiation from _ eccentric _ binary systems .",
    "such binaries emit gravitational radiation at ( infinitely many ) harmonics of the orbital frequency @xcite .",
    "our idea lies simply in measuring the phase of arrival of these harmonics .",
    "dispersion of the form described by equation ( [ eq : vg ] ) would be signaled by the higher harmonics arriving slightly earlier than the lower harmonics , as compared to the general relativistic waveform .",
    "we present a rough estimate of the bounds that might be obtained , deferring a more accurate calculation to a future study ( barack & jones , in preparation ) .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ sect : dotb ] we derive formulae to make a simple estimate of the bounds that might be obtained using our method . in  [ sect : r ] we estimate bounds obtainable on @xmath6 for lisa observations of two sorts of binary systems . finally in  [ sect : c ] we summarize our findings and compare with those of other authors .",
    "to derive a rigorous estimate of the bound one should add the graviton mass to the list of unknown source parameters to be extracted from the measured signal , as was done by will in the case of circular orbits @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1dependent waveform can then be computed , allowing calculation of the fisher information matrix @xmath7 , which could then be inverted , the @xmath8 component , evaluated at @xmath9 , giving the best bound obtainable @xcite . for the case of eccentric binaries such",
    "a calculation is not easy , and so in this paper we make a preliminary estimate of the possible bounds , without going to the trouble of calculating @xmath10",
    ".    we will begin by deriving a general formula for estimating the bound on @xmath6 that could be obtained from a system which produces gravitational waves at two different frequencies , say @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the two gravitational waves will travel with ( different ) speeds @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and so their journey times to the detector a distance @xmath15 away will differ by a time interval @xmath16 given by @xmath17.\\ ] ] multiplying this by @xmath18 , where @xmath3 is a characteristic frequency in the problem , gives the accumulated difference in phase of arrival of the two signals caused by the dispersion , measured in terms of radians of phase of @xmath3 : @xmath19.\\ ] ] this is to be compared with the accuracy with which the phase of arrival of the waves can be extracted from the noisy gravitational wave data stream . in the high signal to noise ratio regime",
    "the error in extracting the phase of a continuous signal can be written as @xmath20 where we follow the notation of @xcite . in this formula",
    "@xmath21 is the signal to noise ratio of the measurement and @xmath22 is a dimensionless factor that depends upon how many unknown parameters ( including the phase ) need be extracted from the signal .",
    "the lower bound that can be placed on @xmath6 comes from equating @xmath23 and @xmath24 to give : @xmath25.\\ ] ] this shows that the best bounds will come from high mass ( i.e. high @xmath26 ) , high eccentricity , low orbital frequency systems .",
    "we will now apply this method of estimation to eccentric binary systems .",
    "in general many more than two harmonics will contribute significantly to @xmath21 , so equation ( [ eq : lambdageneral ] ) is not directly applicable . in order to take advantage of this spread",
    "we will make the following identifications .",
    "we will set @xmath21 equal to the total signal to noise of the observation . to identify appropriate frequencies , consider a plot of the signal to noise of the n - th harmonic , @xmath27 , verses gravitational wave frequency @xmath28 .",
    "we will set @xmath3 to be the frequency at which this curve peaks , and @xmath29 as the frequencies corresponding to the lower and upper full - width - at - half - maximum .",
    "in reality only discrete harmonic frequencies exist , but for the purpose of defining @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath3 , we will treat the curve as continuous , interpolating to find the necessary frequencies .",
    "( a formalism using only discrete frequencies would have introduced spurious step - wise changes in our bounds on @xmath6 as a function of eccentricity ) .",
    "identification of a suitable @xmath22 value , which quantifies the error in phase measurement , is more problematic .",
    "@xcite consider errors in measuring the phase of a single monochromatic signal of known sky location ; they find that @xmath32 for a large fraction of the possible binary orientations .",
    "@xcite examine extreme mass ratio inspirals .",
    "they find phase measurement errors which again yield @xmath33 ( see the @xmath34 parameter of their table iii )",
    ".    however , even in the dispersionless case of general relativity , the relative phasing of the detected harmonics is non - trivially determined by the source s sky location and the relative orientation of the detector and binary system @xcite .",
    "the phase differences we are considering here are _ additional _",
    "delays caused by dispersive propagation .",
    "clearly , then , the results of @xcite and @xcite do not directly apply to our problem .",
    "only a full fisher matrix calculation will accurately show how we can disentangle the phase differences contributed by dispersion , measurement error and those intrinsic to the binary .",
    "we expect that in those situations where the system parameters , including its sky location and orientation relative to lisa , are measured accurately , the dispersion - induced phase delays will be measured accurately too . in the absence of a full fisher matrix calculation to evaluate the correct measurement errors we will set @xmath35 , but note that this is the weakest link in our estimate",
    ".    in particular , if the various geometric factors that enter the problem conspire such that a dispersionless signal from a certain binary is very similar to the dispersed signal from a binary with slightly different parameters ( e.g. a slightly different sky location ) , then the errors in @xmath36 could be very much larger than estimated here .",
    "also , @xmath22 will depend upon the type of system being studied .",
    "it will generally be smaller for systems where information in addition to the gravitational wave signal is available , e.g. galactic binary systems where optical measurements give accurate sky locations .",
    "note , however , that @xmath22 enters the bound on @xmath6 only rather weakly , as @xmath37 , and so we hope that our ignorance of this factor will not change our qualitative conclusions .",
    "it is expected that gravitational radiation reaction will result in most binary systems detectable by ground based interferometers being nearly perfectly circular @xcite and so will be unusable for deriving a bound of the sort described here .",
    "we will therefore concentrate exclusively on ( two sorts of ) binaries in the lisa band . in equation ( [ eq : lambdageneral ] )",
    "we will set @xmath35 , as discussed above .",
    "when calculating @xmath21 we will assume an integration time of one year .",
    "we computed the lisa noise using the online sensitivity curve generator @xcite , which included a fit to the galactic white dwarf background @xcite .",
    "we consider here the inspiral of a solar - mass type black hole into a massive one .",
    "these are excellent systems from our point of view , as they are expected to dominate the lisa inspiral event rate and , crucially , many will have very large eccentricities @xcite .    to see if such systems can indeed be used to obtain a bound on @xmath6 , in figure [ fig1 ] we plot the eccentricity - orbital frequency phase space for a @xmath38 binary at a distance of @xmath39gpc .",
    "the upper curve describes the innermost stable orbit ( iso ) @xcite ; binary systems in nature only exist _ below _ this curve .",
    "the lower curve gives the minimum eccentricity required for the system to be detectable , with multiple harmonics contributing significantly to @xmath21 .",
    "[ our exact criterion is to see if @xmath21 exceeds some detection threshold @xmath40 when the single strongest harmonic is removed from the sum .",
    "we have set @xmath41 , as would be reasonable if computational power does not limit the search @xcite ] .",
    "our methods are only applicable for systems _ above _ this curve .",
    "it follows that we can use binary systems which lie _ between _ these two curves to bound @xmath6 .",
    "fortunately we see that this means that binaries in a significant portion of the @xmath42 plane are of use to us . to illustrate this",
    ", a trajectory of a plausible lisa source is shown between the two curves , with an eccentricity at the iso of about @xmath43 .",
    "this system spends about @xmath44 years between the two curves .    in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we show the actual bounds on @xmath6 that could be obtained from observations of extreme mass ratio systems .",
    "the distance is still fixed at @xmath39gpc , but now we fix the orbital frequency at @xmath45hz and leave the eccentricity as a free parameter . results for binary systems with @xmath46 and several different values of @xmath47 are given , as indicated .",
    "the following features are of note : ( i ) each curve terminates at a minimum eccentricity below which the system is undetectable and/or fewer than two harmonics contribute significantly to @xmath21 , and at a maximum eccentricity above which the system is dynamically unstable .",
    "( ii ) for a system of given masses , the bound increases slightly ( i.e. becomes stronger ) the larger the eccentricity . (",
    "iii ) stronger bounds are obtained from more massive systems , and can be obtained for wider ranges of the eccentricity .",
    "lisa will be able to detect gravitational waves from a large number of low mass galactic binaries , consisting of white dwarfs and/or neutron stars @xcite . to investigate the suitability of these systems for bounding @xmath6 , in figure [ fig3 ] we plot the eccentricity  frequency phase space for a galactic @xmath48 binary at a distance @xmath39kpc .",
    "we set @xmath49 , although a lower value could be used for electromagnetically studied binaries @xcite .",
    "we do not show the iso curve as for all plausible eccentricities such a binary would go dynamically unstable in the much higher ligo frequency band .",
    "clearly , binaries in a large portion of the phase space are of use for bounding @xmath6 . however , unlike the case of the extreme mass ratio inspiral , there is no compelling reason to expect the eccentricities of these systems to be large .",
    "many of them will have gone through a period of mass transfer in the past , which is believed to be an efficient circularizer .",
    "nevertheless , as we require merely _ one or more of them _ to have a sufficiently large eccentricity , greater than about @xmath50 , a bound on @xmath6 may well be obtained .    in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "we present the bounds on @xmath6 that would be obtained from observations of various equal - mass binaries at a distance of @xmath39kpc and with an orbital frequency @xmath45hz .",
    "the qualitative form is the same as in figure [ fig2 ] , except we terminate the curves at the high eccentricity end at @xmath51 as such extreme eccentricities seem unlikely .",
    "in table [ table : lambdag_dynamic ] we collect together reported and proposed dynamic bounds on @xmath6 that have appeared in the literature , and add two proposed bounds from this work .",
    "as is clear from perusal of the table and figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig4 ] , the bounds presented here for low mass galactic systems are comparable to those of @xcite , while our bounds from extreme mass ratio inspirals are comparable to those of @xcite for massive black hole coalescence . it should be remembered that our numbers can only be regarded as estimates , particularly given our rough guess as to the accuracy with which dispersion - induced phase delays can be measured .",
    "however , even if @xmath22 , the parameter which quantifies this error , were four orders of magnitude larger than assumed here , our results for extreme mass ratio inspirals would still beat both solar system and galactic low mass binary tests .",
    "the method presented here has several advantages over other methods .",
    "the analysis of @xcite requires knowledge of the initial relative phases of the x - ray and gravitational wave signals from an accreting white dwarf system ; it is not clear if the accretion process will be sufficiently well understood to allow this .",
    "less problematically , the method of @xcite requires knowledge of the phasing of the binary inspiral waveform in the strongly chirping regime , as it is this frequency variation that allows the dispersion test .",
    "in contrast , the method described here is very simple , requiring only that multiple harmonics can be detected .",
    "it is not necessary for the binary to be chirping significantly , and correlation with other ( i.e. non - gravitational ) radiation is not required .    returning to equation ( [ eq : kg ] ) , in the static regime",
    "the solution is of the form of a yukawa - type potential , i.e. a newtonian one suppressed by an exponential @xmath52 .",
    "this offers the possibility of bounding @xmath6 by looking for departures from newtonian gravity in the non - radiative regime .",
    "such results are given in table [ table : lambdag_static ] .",
    "@xcite used planetary ephemeris data to obtain their bound , while @xcite cited evidence of gravitational binding of galaxy clusters , suggesting that the exponential suppression is not important over length scales of the order of a mpc .",
    "the bounds that could be obtained by using the methods described in this paper would be better than the solar system bounds by around @xmath53 orders of magnitude .",
    "however , they are weaker than those from galaxy clusters by @xmath54 orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , if equation ( [ eq : kg ] ) is the correct linearization of the true theory of gravity , and if galaxy clusters are indeed gravitationally bound , the bounds on @xmath55 from the dynamic sector are much weaker than those from the static sector .",
    "however , the possibility remains that equation ( [ eq : kg ] ) is not the correct linearization , the static potential is not suppressed , but the wave propagation is nevertheless dispersive , i.e. equation ( [ eq : vg ] ) holds but is not derived from an equation of the form of equation ( [ eq : kg ] ) .",
    "the only way of settling this is to use the methods proposed in the dynamic regime .",
    "it could even be the case that neither equations ( [ eq : kg ] ) nor ( [ eq : vg ] ) are correct , but that gravitational waves have some other form of dispersion .",
    "the method considered here ( or any of the methods referred to in table [ table : lambdag_dynamic ] ) could be used to identify this .",
    "having used simple estimates to establish the competitiveness of the method presented here with other dynamic tests , we are currently working to improve the accuracy of our calculation by using the fisher information matrix to calculate the bound ( rather than the methods of  [ sect : dotb ] ; barack & jones , in preparation ) .",
    "we also aim to extend the scope of the investigation by considering the full range of anticipated gravitational wave sources for both ground and space - based detectors .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank leor barack , shane larson , ben owen , steinn sigurdsson and nico yunes for useful discussions during this investigation , and the anonymous referee for providing comments which improved the manuscript .",
