    "the principle of causality is one of the most fundamental pillars on which classical as well as quantum physics is based .",
    "it exhibits itself in terms of the causal structure of a four - dimensional lorentzian space - time manifold .",
    "theories like quantum fields rely on this structure for a sensible interpretation of their results in a fixed background geometry . however , there is no _ apriori _ reason which would suggest that this causal structure should remain unaffected by the dynamical equations of general relativity . if we accept that in quantum cosmology @xcite , amplitudes for gravity can be expressed as sum of histories of 3-geometries @xcite with different global 4-topological structures , then this may give rise to structures that can not have pure lorentzian or euclidean geometries @xcite and this implies a possible signature transition @xcite .",
    "for example , an interesting feature of present day quantum cosmology @xcite is characterised by its use of riemannian signature spaces to arrive at an observable lorentzian - signature spacetime .",
    "therefore , in order to gain further isight , it might be useful to study the dynamics of this phenomenon in simple models .",
    "traditionally , one of the features of classical gravity is that the signature of the metric is usually considered as fixed .",
    "this is not a property demanded by the field equations , but rather a condition one imposes on the metric before looking for solutions to einstein s equations .",
    "if one relaxes this condition , one may find solutions to the field equations , which when interpreted suitably , exhibit a signature transition .    in general",
    ", for studying signature dynamics in the classical realm of gravity @xcite , one assumes that there exists a hypersurface which separates the space into two disjoint regions , one being euclidean and the other lorentzian . on this hypersurface , henceforth called the junction , the metric is either continuous and necessarily degenerate , or discontinuous with nondegenerate one - sided limits @xcite . therefore one can categorize this problem according to the continuity of the metric . having chosen the form of the metric , there are two approaches for solving the field equations .",
    "the first ( continuous ) approach is to assume the validity of einstein s field equations throughout and identify the form of the field equations at the junction with the junction conditions @xcite . in the second ( discontinuous ) approach one finds solutions by solving einstein s equations in disjoint regions next to the junction and then uses specific junction conditions ( _ i.e. _ darmois junction conditions ) to match the solutions @xcite .",
    "this furnishes an alternative way of categorizing the problem .",
    "these different approaches have resulted in mainly two different sets of junction conditions which have led to a controversy between various authors @xcite . within the framework of robertson - walker cosmology using either approach , the scale factor , the scalar field and their first time derivatives",
    "are required to be continuous across the junction .",
    "however within the continuous approach , hayward using a continuous metric has obtained extra conditions restricting the first time derivatives to be zero at the junction .",
    "the controversy mentioned above stems from the claims by some authors that these extra junction conditions are unnecessary , see e.g. @xcite and therefore the matter conservation need not hold under signature change @xcite .",
    "recently , kossowski and kriele @xcite , within the continuous approach , have proved a local existence and uniqueness theorem for solutions of einstein s equations with dust energy momentum tensor in a class of m - dimensional signature changing spacetimes where initial conditions are given on the hypersurface of signature change .",
    "they have also proved a similar theorem in the case where the energy - momentum tensor represents a scalar field which is not self - interacting .    in this paper , we study a classical model where signature transition is possible , using the continuous approach with a continuous metric .",
    "this model is the same as that proposed by dereli and tucker @xcite in which a real massive scalar field is taken as the matter source interacting with gravity and itself in a robertson - walker geometry whose signature evolution is controlled by a preferred coordinate .",
    "one then seeks solutions which are smooth and continuous across the junction on which the metric is degenerate . for the spatially flat universes , this results in exactly solvable",
    "einstein s field equations @xcite .",
    "here we show that signature changing solutions also exist for arbitrary curvature in robertson - walker cosmologies .",
    "we do this by finding analytic solutions to the field equations close to the junction , and confirm and extend them away from the junction by a numerical method .",
    "we also show systematically the general set of restrictions that need to be imposed on the junction conditions and the parameters of this model including the cosmological constant .",
    "the general set of allowed conditions and parameters thus obtained include the ones used in reference @xcite as a special case .",
    "in particular we find an upper bound on the cosmological constant , and the need for the scalar field to be massive in order to have continuous solutions .",
    "the present work is also complementary to @xcite in that it solves the problem for a self - interacting scalar field .",
    "having chosen a continuous approach , we obtain a set of junction conditions which , not surprisingly , are more restrictive than those obtained in the discontinuous approach",
    ". however , the restrictiveness of the junction conditions obtained here lies somewhere in between those obtained in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we shall return to this point in the conclusions .",
    "we begin by briefly reviewing the model , and for comparison purposes , use the same notation as that of @xcite .",
    "consider gravity coupling to a scalar field through @xmath0 ,   \\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the scalar field @xmath1 is a solution of @xmath2 here , @xmath3 is the einstein tensor constructed from torsion - free connections compatible with the metric , and @xmath4 is a scalar potential for the real scalar field @xmath1 interacting with itself and gravity through the stress - energy tensor @xmath5 $ ] , given by @xmath6=d\\phi\\otimes d\\phi-\\frac{1}{2}g(d\\phi , d\\phi)g - u(\\phi)g . \\label{eq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above coupled equations are to be solved in a domain that would lead to robertson - walker cosmologies with lorentzian signature .",
    "however , if the metric is suitably parametrized , one can expect to see continuous transition to a euclidean domain . as in @xcite",
    ", we adopt a chart with coordinate functions @xmath7 where the hypersurface of signature change would be characterised by @xmath8 .",
    "the metric can be parametrized to take the form @xmath9 ^ 2}\\sum_i dx^i \\otimes dx^i ,   \\label{eq4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , and depending on the values of @xmath11 one would have an open , flat or closed universe , respectively .",
    "now , it is apparent that the sign of @xmath12 determines the geometry , being lorentzian if @xmath13 and euclidean if @xmath14 . for @xmath13 , the traditional cosmic time",
    "can be recovered by the substitution @xmath15 .",
    "adopting the chart @xmath16 and using equations ( [ eq1 ] ) through ( [ eq4 ] ) with units in which @xmath17 , one finds @xmath18&= & \\frac{\\dot{\\phi}^2}{2}+u(\\phi ) , \\label{eq5}\\\\ 2\\left(\\frac{\\dot{r}}{r}\\right)^{\\ !",

    "this action can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23\\right\\}dt+ d(3r^2\\dot{r } ) .",
    "\\label{eq7.3}\\ ] ] after dropping the total derivative term and using the following transformation , @xmath24 we obtain a mechanical analogue for this system given by the lagrangian @xmath25 with @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 . by a straightforward legendre transformation",
    "we obtain the  hamiltonian \" @xmath29 which we identify with the total energy density of the system .",
    "if we transform this expression back to the form of @xmath30 and @xmath1 , we see that equation ( [ eq5 ] ) is nothing more than a  zero energy condition .",
    "\" of course any solution of the euler - lagrange equations would yield a constant total energy .",
    "however , einstein s equations demand zero energy solutions only .",
    "the above lagrangian is considerably simplified if we take the potential to be @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are free parameters .",
    "this potential is required to have natural characteristics for small @xmath1 , so that we may identify the coefficient of @xmath35 in its taylor expansion as a positive @xmath36 and @xmath37 as a cosmological constant @xmath38 . in terms of the above parameters , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the features of this potential have been discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "the dynamical equations for @xmath41 and @xmath42 in terms of the evolution variable @xmath12 now become @xmath43 subject to the  zero energy condition \" @xmath44 here , a prime represents differentiation with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "the coupled equations ( [ eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq13 ] ) must now be solved and , since their solutions render @xmath45 a constant in @xmath46 , equation ( [ eq14 ] ) becomes only a restriction on the initial conditions . in the next section we first find analytic solutions to these equations which are valid close to the junction , and then find the solutions for the full range of @xmath46 by a numerical method .",
    "in this section we find analytic solutions which are valid near the junction , and obtain the restrictions imposed by equations ( [ eq12])([eq14 ] ) on the junction conditions .",
    "this is done by noting that in order to have well behaved solutions close to @xmath8 , the first term of equation ( [ eq14 ] ) shows that we must either have @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , or @xmath51 .",
    "however , the first terms on the right hand side of equations ( [ eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq13 ] ) impose a more severe restriction .",
    "these two equations admit solutions @xmath52 and @xmath53 close to @xmath8 , however , these class of solutions do not admit real or @xmath54 solutions across @xmath8 . one can show that regular solutions close to @xmath8 are of the form @xmath55 ,   \\label{eqxc0}\\\\ y(\\beta ) & = & a_y \\beta^3+y_0 \\hspace{5 mm } \\mbox{where } \\hspace{5 mm }   a_y= \\frac{2}{9 } \\left[-\\frac{3}{4}\\frac{ky_0}{(x^2_0-y^2_0)^{2/3}}-a_2 y_0-bx_0\\right ] ,   \\label{eqyc0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath56 etc .",
    "therefore , the initial conditions on the first and second derivatives must satisfy the relations @xmath57    strictly speaking the conditions on the second derivatives are not initial conditions but rather consistency checks , since we have coupled second order equations .",
    "the above relations confine the possible solutions to a restricted class .",
    "therefore , the initial values for the functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 must now satisfy , c.f .",
    "equation ( [ eq14 ] ) @xmath58 although equation ( [ eq16 ] ) is equivalent to a sixth order algebraic equation which can not be directly solved analytically , we can solve it by going back to the original variables @xmath30 and @xmath1",
    ". the solutions are either @xmath59 giving @xmath60 , which we exclude because we have been seeking continuous solutions across @xmath8 , or @xmath61 ( it is a free parameter ) with @xmath62 , \\label{eq166}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 the contour plots of equation ( [ eq16 ] ) for @xmath64 are given in figure 1 .",
    "along the contours , one finds the possible initial values for @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "of course , the acceptable values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( @xmath65 ) can also be obtained analytically from equation ( [ eq166 ] ) .    in order for this model to have a valid quantum extension , at least in the scalar sector ,",
    "we need to require the potential to have a minimum so that a real mass can be defined .",
    "that is @xmath66 therefore we need to require @xmath67 .",
    "this requirement along with the requirement of having real values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 satisfying the zero energy condition and leading to real values for @xmath70 and @xmath71 give the following restriction on the parameters @xmath72 it is important to note here that equations ( [ eqxc0],[eqyc0 ] ) imply @xmath73 these in turn lead to @xmath74-\\frac{b}{\\alpha } \\cosh[2\\alpha\\phi(0 ) ] .",
    "\\label{eqddot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the physical significance of these constraints and their relevance to the present controversy on the junction conditions will be discussed in the last section .",
    "a noticeable feature of equations ( [ eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq13 ] ) is that for @xmath75 they are singular at the critical values of @xmath12 ( @xmath76 ) at which @xmath77 . in terms of the original variables we have @xmath78 and @xmath79",
    "coincide with the junction at which @xmath80 . ] .",
    "any attempt in solving these equations involves handling these  moving singularities , \" as one encounters them when integrating the coupled equations . to handle these singularities , we establish jump conditions across them as follows : close to @xmath81 , we assume that the solutions have the following linear forms @xmath82 @xmath83 where @xmath84 refers to the right or left hand sides of the singularity respectively . substituting the above equations in ( [ eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq13 ] ) and integrating in the interval @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the distance across the jump , gives the following equation at @xmath87 @xmath88 where @xmath89 can be taken as small a value as is desired for any required accuracy",
    ". moreover , the values of @xmath90 and @xmath91 are determined by the requirement of the continuity of @xmath41 and @xmath42 at @xmath76 .",
    "equation ( [ eq17 ] ) establishes our jump condition for handling the singularities of the differential equations . for ease of comparison with the solutions of the spatially flat ( @xmath92 ) robertson - walker universe",
    ", we use the same set of parameters as in @xcite ( @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) and choose our initial conditions according to equations ( [ eq15 ] ) and ( [ eq16 ] ) .",
    "we note that since equation ( [ eq14 ] ) is a constant of motion , if it is satisfied at @xmath8 , it will be satisfied at all other values of @xmath12 . for integrating equations ( [ eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq13 ] ) ,",
    "we have used the fourth order runge - kutta method .",
    "the resulting solutions for @xmath64 are shown in figure 2 . as a measure of the accuracy of the solutions ,",
    "we have computed the ",
    "zero energy condition , \" equation ( [ eq14 ] ) , as a function of @xmath12 for @xmath64 .",
    "we have found that the values of  total energy \" stay very close to zero in the full range of @xmath12 shown in figure 2 , thus indicating the validity of our numerical solutions . as a further check ,",
    "we have numerically recovered the analytic solutions presented in @xcite for @xmath92 . in figure 3",
    "the variations of @xmath1 and @xmath30 and in figure 4 that of the curvature scalar are shown as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "we have shown that in the context of classical general relativity , using a model proposed in @xcite , there could exist signature transitions in robertson - walker cosmologies with arbitrary curvature . in this model ,",
    "these transitions are embodied in the form of smooth continuous functions describing solutions to einstein field equations coupled to a scalar field .",
    "these solutions describe a geometry in which the covariant metric tensor is degenerate on a hypersurface characterised by @xmath8 and undergoes a transition from a euclidean to a lorentzian signature . as in the @xmath92 case ,",
    "the singular behaviour of the scalar field characterizes the beginning of the euclidean domain .",
    "this feature is also reflected in the behaviour of the curvature scalar . for @xmath92 the solutions for @xmath41 and @xmath42 are not singular anywhere in the lorentzian domain . however , for @xmath75 , there are singularities at @xmath96 but they are very mild and show up only at the second derivative level . as @xmath97 increases we observe more rapid oscillations in @xmath41 and @xmath42 , leading to more rapid variations in all the physical quantities .",
    "however , for all values of @xmath97 , they vary extremely slowly in the vicinity of the signature changing hypersurface , as can be seen from figures 3 and 4 .    as far as the controversy on the junction conditions in the current literature is concerned",
    ", we find that in our continuous approach to signature change ( with a continuous metric ) the restrictions on the initial conditions are given by equations ( [ eq15],[eqdot],[eqddot ] ) .",
    "these conditions are slightly more restrictive than those of @xcite , because equation ( [ eq15 ] ) implies that the second derivatives of @xmath30 and @xmath1 with respect to the evolution parameter @xmath98 are zero , whereas the analysis presented there does not seem to require this .",
    "however , the junction conditions of @xcite seem to be too restrictive since it requires the second ( cosmic ) time derivatives of @xmath30 and @xmath1 to be zero , contrary to equation ( [ eqddot ] ) . as was mentioned before",
    ", we only require the second derivatives with respect to @xmath12 to be zero .",
    "we now discuss the physical significance of the restrictions on the parameters of the model which is presented in equation ( [ eq1666 ] ) .",
    "when this equation is written in terms of the physical parameters it becomes @xmath99 in particular we have @xmath100 and this implies that @xmath38 can not have an arbitrarily large positive value .",
    "rather more importantly , note that as @xmath101 , equation ( [ eq2ineq ] ) implies that @xmath102 and subsequently equation ( [ eq166 ] ) shows that @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , in order to have continuous solutions across the junction , the scalar field has to be massive .",
    "we expect this result to be independent of the particular choice of the potentual @xmath104 .",
    "it is interesting to note that although the solutions for @xmath92 and @xmath64 are qualitatively not very different , there is a pronounced difference in the curvature scalar .",
    "that is @xmath105 .",
