    "in summary , for the first time sifs - jjs with a strong magnetic interlayer , i.e. @xmath3 and an @xmath54 tunnel barrier were studied .",
    "our samples had a large density of data points , ranging from the magnetically dead regime towards very thick @xmath1 layers , being larger than in previous work on sfs jjs with elemental magnets @xcite , where the data spacing was of the same order of magnitude as the phase oscillation lengths .",
    "thus , we show the first results that allow to find the oscillation period for the elemental magnets reliably .",
    "the insertion of f - layer leads to additional interface scattering compared to non - magnetic junctions and inside the dead magnetic layer @xmath0 drops exponentially .",
    "the dead magnetic layer thickness @xmath27 has been determined directly from transport measurements .",
    "the critical current @xmath8 changes its sign as a function of the f - layer thickness @xmath1 , exhibiting regions with @xmath5 and @xmath6 ground states . for @xmath1 near the @xmath5 to @xmath6 crossover the ground state can be controlled by changing the temperature .",
    "this is the first observation of a temperature - induced phase change using a strong magnet . for certain thicknesses",
    "the junctions show magnetic anisotropy effects , leading to a distortion of their @xmath49 pattern .",
    "overall , the transport regime is dirty , although locally inside the magnetically active f - layer regime a deviation from the strict dirty limit theory appears .",

    "<S> the dependence of the critical current density @xmath0 on the ferromagnetic interlayer thickness @xmath1 was determined for @xmath2 josephson tunnel junctions with ferromagnetic @xmath3 interlayer thicknesses from very thin films ( @xmath4 ) upwards and classified into f - layer thickness regimes showing a dead magnetic layer , exchange , exchange + anisotropy and total suppression of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the josephson coupling changes from @xmath5 to @xmath6 as function of @xmath1 , and -very close to the crossover thickness- as function of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the strong suppression of the supercurrent in comparison to non - magnetic @xmath7 junctions indicated that the insertion of a f - layer leads to additional interface scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the transport inside the dead magnetic layer was in dirty limit . for the magnetically active regime </S>",
    "<S> fitting with both the clean and the dirty limit theory were carried out , indicating dirty limit condition , too . </S>",
