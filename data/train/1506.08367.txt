    "this was proved by donaldson in the ground - breaking article @xcite using @xmath6 gauge theory .",
    "nowadays , it is still an active and challenging problem to construct symplectic @xmath0-manifolds which are homeomorphic but not diffemorphic to small rational surfaces . a concise history of constructing exotic smooth structures on simply - connected @xmath0-manifolds with @xmath2 can be found in the introductions of @xcite . for recent progress on this problem",
    "we refer the reader to ( @xcite ) , where the first exotic minimal symplectic @xmath7 ( for @xmath8 ) were constructed .",
    "the small exotic symplectic @xmath0-manifolds with @xmath2 also play very important role in understanding the geography of symplectic @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "many interesting applications of the symplectic @xmath0-manifolds with @xmath2 to the geography of simply connected non - spin and spin symplectic @xmath0-manifolds can be found in @xcite and the references therein .",
    "it is also worth mentioning the work in @xcite , where the restriction on the fundamental group of the aspherical symplectic @xmath0-manifolds has been studied by ibez - kdra - rudyak - tralle .",
    "the wall crossing phenomenon of seiberg - witten invariant along with taubes sw = gr does provide us abundant @xmath9-holomorphic curves on symplectic @xmath0-manifolds with @xmath2 .",
    "this fact is the cornerstone for many similarities between these symplectic manifolds and algebraic surfaces .",
    "especially , this holds true for many properties involving linear systems or family of curves in a given homology class .",
    "a khler surface with @xmath2 has the geometric genus @xmath10 . by the kodaira embedding theorem",
    ", any such surface has to be an algebraic one .",
    "besides several similarities with algebraic surfaces from the geometric aspects stated above , the topology of symplectic @xmath0-manifolds with @xmath2 is quite different from that of algebraic surfaces with @xmath11 .",
    "for example , it is expected that there are infinitely many minimal symplectic manifolds which are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "but on the other hand , there are only finitely many such algebraic surfaces since the moduli space is a quasi - projective variety .",
    "one of the main goals of the current article is to demonstrate the huge difference between the topology of symplectic @xmath0-manifolds with @xmath2 and that of algebraic surfaces . in this paper",
    ", we are mainly interested in comparing the fundamental groups that occur in these two categories , rather than simply connected @xmath0-manifolds .    in a seminal paper , published in the annals of mathematics in 1995",
    ", gompf @xcite showed that any finitely presented group @xmath14 is the fundamental group of some symplectic @xmath0-manifold .",
    "one drawback of the construction is that the symplectic @xmath0-manifolds in @xcite are too large .",
    "it is then very natural to ask the `` smallest size '' of such symplectic @xmath0-manifolds with a given fundamental group @xmath14 . since the first betti number @xmath15 is determined by the group @xmath14 as the rank of @xmath16)$ ] , a natural quantity to describe the size is @xmath17 .",

    "the smallest value of @xmath17 that is known to occur in symplectic @xmath0-manifolds with @xmath30 is @xmath31 .",
    "see later discussion for details . by applying our theorem  [ main ] to the symplectic @xmath0-manifolds with @xmath2 , we deduce the following corollary    [ fund_b+=1 ] given any finitely presented group @xmath14 which is dual finite torsion with @xmath32 there is a minimal symplectic @xmath0-manifold with @xmath2 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath18 surjects onto @xmath14 and @xmath24 .",
    "the groups @xmath14 with @xmath32 are often called @xmath35-perfect in the literature .    most of the symplectic @xmath0-manifolds that we construct in this paper are non - khler .",
    "any minimal complex surface with @xmath33 is an elliptic surface .",
