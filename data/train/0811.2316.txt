    "the effect of an applied magnetic field on cw spectroscopy is as dramatic as the effect on pulse propagation . in figure",
    "[ fig : ix](a ) the conventional doppler - broadened transmission signal is seen to oscillate between zero and the zero - field transmission when a modest field is applied .",
    "this is a consequence of polarisation rotation due to the faraday effect .",
    "large rotations of above @xmath0  rad are seen close to resonance , and even at detunings of many ghz the difference in transmission is noticeable .",

    "over 30 fringes are observed before one reaches a detuning sufficiently small that the medium is optically thick .",
    "these large rotations are useful for applications that require multiple @xmath0 rotations .",
    "the large number of fringes observed in figure  [ fig : diff ] arises from the same phenomenon that enhances the spectral response in a slow - light interferometer @xcite ( see methods ) .",
    "a powerful property of the polarimetry signal is that it allows a direct read - out of the differential refractive and group indices .",
    "the signal tends to zero at large negative detuning ( not shown ) and each subsequent zero corresponds to a @xmath0 phase shift between the left and right circular components .",
    "this phase difference , @xmath5 , is plotted in figure  [ fig : diff](b ) .",
    "note that the first zero crossing ( corresponding to a @xmath13 rotation ) occurs at a detuning of @xmath26  ghz where the absorption is less than @xmath27 . at temperatures of order 200@xmath14c , the first zero shifts out to beyond @xmath28  ghz i.e. @xmath29 doppler linewidths .",

    "it can be seen in figure  [ fig : diff](b ) that far from resonance the relative phase evolves slowly with detuning , in particular for detunings greater than @xmath30  ghz , where @xmath31 . for a linearly polarised pulse centred in this region with ghz bandwidth , the phase variation across its spectrum",
    "is sufficiently low so that the polarisation of the pulse as a whole can be rotated by a large angle .",
    "this broadband rotation is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : pulserot ] , where a 1  ghz bandwidth pulse polarised in the x direction is rotated into the y direction by increasing an applied magnetic field from zero to 230  g. this @xmath13 rotation is accompanied by low absorption ( less than 2% ) and no distortion since the pulse is many doppler - broadened linewidths from resonance .",
    "light switching with such large bandwidth and with low loss / distortion has not been observed previously using an all - optical atom - light interface .     transition centre by @xmath3210  ghz , for a vapour temperature of 135@xmath14c . a field of 80  g ( green ) and",
    "230  g ( blue ) is applied , showing the pulse rotating into the y direction whilst retaining its linear polarisation and intensity.,width=340 ]",
    "for linearly polarised continuous - wave light the plane of polarisation is rotated by an angle dependent on the medium s relative phase index , whilst its spectral sensitivity is dependent on the relative group index .",
    "these quantities can differ by more than six orders of magnitude , making the phase shift highly frequency dependent and hence of interest in the fields of interferometry and polarimetry .",
    "the faraday rotation angle was seen to go from zero at large detunings to @xmath33 radians close to resonance , over a frequency range of @xmath34  ghz .",
    "this rotation corresponds to a verdet constant of @xmath35  rad  g@xmath36  cm@xmath36 , three orders of magnitude larger than in typical commercial faraday rotators  @xcite .",
    "large rotations are also seen in thin magneto - optical photonic crystals  @xcite , but the effect in such a system can not be varied dynamically .",
    "the rotation in the atomic vapour is temperature , magnetic - field and frequency dependent , therefore the effect can be used as a tunable polarisation switch .",
    "in addition , we mention how polarimetry provides a useful spectroscopy tool  @xcite .",
    "the large bandwidth of off - resonant polarimetry could provide a useful technique to probe fast dynamics of rydberg states in a thermal vapour  @xcite or atomic beam  @xcite in the high density regime where interactions and hence novel non - linear optical effects are significant .    for broadband pulses , with spectral widths of hundreds of mhz to ghz , in the wings of a resonance ,",
    "the faraday effect manifests itself as an asymmetry in the propagation of left / right circularly polarised light .",
    "if the linearly polarised pulse s bandwidth is narrow enough such that the relative phase shift across it is essentially constant , the polarisation angle is rotated in the same way as for cw light . far from resonance ,",
    "a ghz bandwidth pulse can be rotated by @xmath13  rad with less than 2% loss and no distortion .",
    "increasing the phase variation across the pulse , e.g. by changing the applied field or carrier detuning , changes a single rotated linear pulse to split circular pulses in a dynamic way . splitting a pulse into two components separated by more than their temporal widths",
    "could be used for pump - probe experiments ; or for photon switching or atomic ensemble entanglement  @xcite in quantum information applications .    at higher temperatures and magnetic fields , the available bandwidth of many ghz",
    "make it possible for pulses of hundreds of picosecond duration to be delayed and rotated with high transmission .",
    "appropriate choice of atomic species and laser wavelength opens up the possibility of submarine ( at @xmath38  nm )  @xcite and fibre - optic ( at @xmath39  @xmath40 m ) communications at the large bit rates required for rapid data transfer .",
    "the slow - light faraday effect allows dynamic control of pulse shape and polarisation .",
    "since this control is implemented via the applied magnetic field fast switching times of 1 microsecond or less would be difficult to achieve .",
    "however , the asymmetry in left and right circular polarisations due to the magneto - optical effect is not unique : any phenomenon which causes a change in the dispersive properties of a medium can lead to circular birefringence .",
    "an alternative method is to redistribute population in the magnetic sublevels by optical driving . a distribution which produces different coupling strengths for the two circular polarisations leads to the same effects described in this paper .",
    "augmenting ( or replacing ) the faraday effect with optical control will potentially allow faster reconfiguration times than are possible via alteration of the applied magnetic field .",
    "hence any tunable device based on optical control would have faster switching times .",
    "the large bandwidth of the slow light makes possible the probing of atomic dynamics on a timescale much shorter than the excited state lifetime .",
    "the application of the effect to probe the coherent evolution of strongly driven thermal rb atoms will be the focus of future work .",
    "the faraday effect arises due to the interference between the left and right circularly polarised components of the electric field . in general",
    ", the phase shift , @xmath5 , between two waves is produced by a differing optical path length , @xmath41 , where @xmath2 is the phase index of the wave with velocity @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the length of the path taken by the wave .",
    "the phase shift between two waves of angular frequency @xmath44 is given by  @xcite @xmath45 where the wavenumber , @xmath46 , and refractive index are taken to be real .",

    "<S> such large group indices are the result of a rapid change in refractive index over a narrow spectral range , requiring narrowband pulses . </S>",

    "<S> sit has been used to rotate pulses as short as 5  ns  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this requires intensities above saturation and the near - resonant character of the process leads to higher order terms in the dispersion resulting in considerable pulse distortion . </S>",
