    "several years ago a new fractional statistics was proposed @xcite in arbitrary dimensions which allows a finite number of multi - occupancy states of a single state . since",
    "that a single quantum state can be occupied by @xmath8 identical particles , this formalism opens the way to a new thermodynamics based on an extension of the pauli exclusion principle . from a calculation of the second virial coefficient for low values of the fugacity",
    "@xmath4 it was found in @xcite that an ideal gas becomes bosonic for @xmath5 .",
    "also , a calculation of the heat capacity @xmath9 for high @xmath4 values showed that the system remains fermionic for @xmath5 .",
    "certainly , these approximate calculations show that a thermodynamic system that follows @xmath1-statistics exhibit anyonic behavior for low @xmath4 values but miss the details that could tell us how this behavior depends on the fugacity @xmath4 and the maximum occupancy @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , one important question that one may address is related to the stability of systems based on @xmath1-statistics as compared with fermionic ( @xmath6 ) and bosonic ( @xmath7 ) cases .",
    "the answer to these questions can be given by performing a calculation of the thermodynamic curvature @xmath3 , which in our case , is nothing else than the scalar curvature in the two - dimensional space defined by the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the idea of using geometry to study some properties of thermodynamic systems @xcite-@xcite opened the way to the basic formalism of defining a metric in a two dimensional parameter space and calculate the corresponding scalar curvature as a measure of the correlations strength of the system @xcite-@xcite , with applications to classical and quantum gases @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , magnetic systems @xcite-@xcite , non - extensive statistical mechanics @xcite-@xcite , anyon gas @xcite-@xcite , fractional statistics @xcite , deformed boson and fermion systems @xcite , systems with fractal distribution functions @xcite and quantum group invariance @xcite .",
    "some of the basic results of this formalism is the relationship between the departure of the scalar curvature @xmath3 from the zero value and the stability of the system , and the fact that @xmath3 vanishes for a classical gas , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) for a boson ( fermion ) gas and becomes singular at a critical point . here , in order to study the stability and anyonic behavior of systems with m - statistics we calculate the dependence of the scalar curvature on the fugacity @xmath4 and the maximum occupation number @xmath1 . in section [ m ]",
    "we briefly describe the formalism of @xmath1-statistics . in section [ sc ]",
    "we calculate the scalar curvature for @xmath1-statistics in two and three dimensions . in section [ c ]",
    "we discuss and summarize our results .",
    "in this section we briefly introduce the formalism of @xmath1-statistics , the details and the comparison of @xmath1-statistics with fractional exclusion statistics can be found in ref .",
    "for a single species of particles the set of orthonormal eigenstates of the number operator @xmath14 are denoted by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 the annihilation and creation operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 satisfy a set of relations @xmath20 where @xmath21 in particular , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath24 for all values of @xmath25 such that @xmath26 . for multi - species of particles the states",
    "are simply written as @xmath27 with the corresponding number operators satisfying commutation relations @xmath28=0 $ ] and the @xmath18 and @xmath19 operators satisfying two possible commutation rules @xmath29 it is simple to see that the states are fermionic for @xmath6 , and become bosonic for @xmath7 .",
    "the partition function takes the simple form @xmath30 in the thermodynamic limit , we obtain in arbitrary dimensions @xmath31 @xmath32 with @xmath33 and the factor @xmath34 .",
    "the metric @xmath35 for a thermodynamic system is defined @xcite as the second order term after expanding the information distance @xmath36 between two statistical close states @xmath37 and @xmath38 leading to @xmath39 where in our case the thermodynamic coordinates are @xmath40 and @xmath41 . for exponential distributions , @xmath42",
    ", the metric simply reduces to @xmath43 from eqs .",
    "( [ z ] ) and ( [ g ] ) it is simple to obtain that the metric tensor components are written in terms of the second moments of the energy and particle number as follows @xmath44 from the metric we obtain the scalar curvature @xmath3 from the definition @xmath45 where @xmath46 and due to the obvious identities like @xmath47 the non - vanishing part of the curvature tensor @xmath48 is given in terms of the christoffel symbols @xmath49 as follows @xmath50 the calculation of @xmath3 simply reduces to solve @xmath51 where @xmath52 . from eq .",
    "( [ lnz ] ) we find that the metric components can be written @xmath53 where the function @xmath54 is the integral    @xmath55    where the function @xmath56 and @xmath57 . the function @xmath54 satisfies the simple relation @xmath58 we obtain for the scalar curvature @xmath3 for arbitrary @xmath31 @xmath59.\\label{r}\\ ] ] + figures 1 and 2 show the results of a numerical calculation of equation ( [ r ] ) for the scalar curvature in @xmath60 .",
    "figure 1 shows the dependence of @xmath3 on the fugacity @xmath4 for the values @xmath61 .",
    "for @xmath62 the system is bosonic for very low values of @xmath4 and becomes fermionic for @xmath63 .",
    "the switch from bosonic to fermionic occurs at higher values of @xmath4 as @xmath1 increases . for large values of @xmath4 and @xmath1 , these systems are more stable than the fermionic @xmath6 system .",
    "there is a value of @xmath4 like @xmath64 for @xmath62 and @xmath65 for @xmath66 where the scalar curvature vanishes and thus @xmath1-systems mimic a classical gas behavior .",
    "figure 2 shows the values of the scalar curvature @xmath3 as a function of @xmath67 for the fugacity values @xmath68 . for @xmath69 ,",
    "m - systems become bosonic as @xmath1 increases . for",
    "@xmath70 the behavior is fermionic for all values of @xmath1 . for any @xmath4",
    "there is a value of @xmath5 after which the scalar curvature becomes constant",
    ". the instability increases at those values of @xmath65 and larger values of @xmath1 , as expected .",
    "the behavior at @xmath71 , shown in figures 3 and 4 , is quite similar to the one in three dimensions .",
    "figure 5 displays the scalar curvature for @xmath72 for the standard bose - einstein case @xmath73 , @xmath66 and @xmath74 .",
    "the stability is practically identical up to a value of @xmath4 where the bose - einstein system becomes more unstable approaching the onset of bose - einstein condensation and the @xmath1-systems are more stable and switching to fermionic ( @xmath13 ) at higher values of @xmath4 .",
    "in this manuscript we have calculated the scalar curvature for systems following @xmath1-statistics in two and three dimensions . since the scalar curvature @xmath3 is positive ( negative ) for bosons ( fermions ) our results",
    "give us a detailed picture about the anyonic behavior than a calculation of the virial coefficients could provide .",
    "in addition , the values of the scalar curvature tell us about the correlations and thus the stability of the system .",
    "a particular feature of @xmath1-systems is that their behavior is very similar in two and three dimensions . for those values @xmath72 these systems are bosonic and more stable than the standard bose - einstein case , and become fermionic at higher values of @xmath4 .",
    "the change from bosonic to fermionic occurs at higher values of @xmath4 as the maximum occupation number @xmath1 increases .",
    "therefore , @xmath1-statistics provides a different framework , other than quantum group invariant systems @xcite , to study anyonic behavior if ever observed in either two or three dimensions .",
