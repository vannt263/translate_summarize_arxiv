    "dynamical studies are hampered both by the fact that radio - source emission is predominantly non - thermal , and by instrumentation that can not yet provide the spatially - resolved high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy needed to probe the dynamics of the x - ray gas through its line emission .",
    "if the x - ray gas is mixed with cooler ionized material that emits lines in the optical or near infrared , or neutral gas emitting in the radio or sub - mm , then dynamical studies are greatly enhanced .",
    "for this reason , the study of radio galaxies with cooler emission - line gas in their environments is of particular interest , especially those displaying jet - cloud interactions , where an interaction interface is directly revealed .",

    "there is an additional reason that  is important : its radio power and morphology place it on the borderline between the  and  classes .",

    "the scaling of cavity and radio power that is found @xcite , when combined with the radio luminosity function @xcite , means that radio - mode feedback is dominated by sources of  transition power @xcite , with half the total heating expected from sources with powers @xmath1 times the  transition power .",

    "what is exciting this gas is uncertain , and while @xcite favour shocks as being dominant , they do not rule out photoionization from young stars in the filaments .",
    "the observation of resolved hi absorption that is detected against both radio lobes with velocity structure matched to that seen in emission - line gas has led @xcite to suggest that the ionized and neutral gas are two phases of the same structure , of total gas mass at least @xmath3 m@xmath4 , resulting from a merger of s host with at least one large gas - rich galaxy .",
    "the cold gas is deduced to be filamentary on a sub - arcsec scale : an anti - correlation of radio polarization and h@xmath0 emission , particularly in the northern hotspot and around the southern jet , is interpreted as the result of differential faraday rotation from multiple clumps of thermal material lying within the radio beam @xcite .",

    ".    the abundances found in our fits were low , at @xmath29 times solar , but this may be an artifact of fitting a simple model to a region which is likely to include temperature structure , together with contributions from unresolved low - mass x - ray binaries and x - rays arising from inverse compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( ic - cmb ) by an electron population responsible for the radio synchrotron emission , as detected in many lobed radio galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we argue that in  emission from diffuse thermal gas _ dominates _ the extended x - rays .",
    "firstly , x - ray binaries are estimated at only a few per cent of the 1-kev flux density based on typical integrated luminosities in elliptical galaxies taken from @xcite .",
    "a more important consideration is ic - cmb emission .",
    "this should be strongest where the radio is brightest .",
    "while to some degree that is true , in that the extent of x - ray emission evident in figure  [ fig : xradaptimage ] is similar to that of the overall radio source , there is a greater association with the surrounds of the lobes than with regions where the lobes are radio brightest ( see section [ sec : overall ] ) .    for a more quantitative assessment of the ic - cmb emission",
    "we first note that it is difficult spectrally over the _",
    "chandra _",
    "bandpass to discriminate between gas of temperature roughly 1 kev and steep - spectrum power - law emission unless statistics are very good .",
    "the difficulty applies here , and a fit to a single - component power law is formally acceptable , but the spectral index of @xmath30 should match @xmath31 for ic - cmb , which it does not ( @xmath32 to 0.68 over the brightest regions of the radio lobes ) .",
    "moreover , we have modelled the brightest parts of each radio lobe as spheres of radii 8 arcsec , and found minimum - energy magnetic fields ( without protons ) of 1.5 and 1.4 nt for the s and n lobes , respectively . with these field strengths , only about 5 percent of the 1-kev flux density of extended emission is accommodated , and the field would need to be reduced by a factor of about 6 for ic - cmb emission to be at a level comparable to the x - ray emission seen .",
    "this factor is much larger than typical of radio lobes @xcite .",
    "even then the steep spectrum would still not be explained , and so we consider non - thermal explanations for the extended x - ray emission no further .",
    "we have argued that the extended x - ray emission is dominated by emission from gas of @xmath33  kev , a temperature appropriate for group gas .",
    "the inferred bolometric luminosity in a source - centre annulus of radii 6 and 25 arcsec is @xmath34 ergs s@xmath6 ( or @xmath35 ergs s@xmath6 in the commonly - used 0.1 - 2.4  kev band ) . to test",
    "roughly if the surface brightness lends support for a group origin , we have fitted a @xmath36-model to a radial profile of the emission within this annulus .",
    "the best fit gives @xmath37 and a core radius of 7.3 arcsec , although uncertainties are large .",
    "based on scaling relations of @xcite it is necessary for this system to go out to a radius of roughly 295 arcsec to reach @xmath38 .",
    "if we then restrict @xmath36 to lie in a reasonable range of 0.40.6 , we find an extrapolated @xmath39 within @xmath38 of @xmath40 ergs s@xmath6 , which is not unreasonable for a group atmosphere of this temperature ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , it is striking that the detected x - ray emission covers only the radio lobes .",
    "how recently the group was formed is an interesting question .",
    "the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) reveals the presence of several fainter galaxies within a projected radius of 120 kpc ( 75 arcsec ) of .",
    "while velocity data are largely lacking , 2masx j12541671 + 2736531 , with an appearance in _ hst _  data of an edge - on spiral , lies on the perimeter of such a circle and is separated in velocity by only about 600 km s@xmath6 .",
    "thus it is reasonable to suppose the presence of group companions .",
    "the evidence for  expanding into at least @xmath3 m@xmath4 of relatively settled gas covering the lobes led @xcite to propose that a major merger commenced at least @xmath41 years ago , before the triggering of the radio source .",
    "we estimate the mass in x - ray - emitting gas to be roughly @xmath42 m@xmath4 within a radius of 25 arcsec of the centre .",
    "this then dominates the mass of the presumed merger remnant , and argues that the group atmosphere is likely to pre - date the merger .",
    "the morphological comparison between the radio and x - ray emission ( section [ sec : overall ] ) shows evidence for the radio lobes having bored cavities in the gas , as is found common in group and cluster atmospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in group atmospheres cavities",
    "are found to be accompanied by particularly strong shocks , with mach numbers ranging from about 1.5 to 3 , such as in hcg 62 @xcite , ngc 5813 @xcite and  @xcite , although only in the last case is the radio source from the  class of which  is also a member and which is expected to be most characteristic of heating in the universe as a whole .",
    "the way in which the x - ray enhancements embrace the radio lobes of  points to relatively strong shocks being likely here too , although the x - ray emission is too weak for quantitative assessment of shock speed .",
    "@xcite found for  that the the cavity power , @xmath43 , increased by a factor of 40 once the deduced mach number ( @xmath44 ) of the expansion and the kinetic and thermal energy in shocked gas are taken into account . without this increase , @xmath43 was much too low to fall on an extension from  to  powers of correlations with 1.4-ghz radio power @xcite . for  we can not measure a mach number for the expansion , but we do find that @xmath43 falls far below correlations unless there is a significant energy contribution from strong shocks .",
    "the total 1.4-ghz flux density from the nvss survey @xcite is 2.9 jy , leading to @xmath45 erg s@xmath6 and an expected cavity power from correlations of @xmath43 of @xmath46 erg s@xmath6 , although with large errors @xcite . in contrast , assuming the group gas in a sphere of radius @xmath47 has been pushed aside by each lobe in a lifetime of about 10 myr ( see section [ sec : hic ] , a factor of four shorter than the sound - crossing time in the group gas ) , with no correction for the kinetic and thermal energy in shocked gas we estimate a cavity power of only @xmath48 erg s@xmath6 .    ) on the h@xmath0 image from figure 1b of @xcite.,width=321 ]    the argument that the observed x - ray gas is shocked by the radio lobes of  is also supported by a morphological comparison between the locations of x - ray and cooler gas around the lobes . while the picture of enhancements embracing the radio lobes is generally similar to that seen in h@xmath0 , an overlay of x - ray contours on an emission - line image ( figure  [ fig : largexonhalpha ] ) suggests that , with the exception of the core , jet - cloud interaction region and northern hotspot , there is an anti - correlation of x - ray and h@xmath0 emission , particularly for filaments of emission - line gas in the east and south - west quadrants .",
    "this can be understood if shock advance around the lobe is responsible for the x - ray brightening , and is inhibited by denser h@xmath0-emitting material .",
    "the anti - correlation is not easy to understand if the lobes are weakly pushing aside the external medium , since in that case x - ray and h@xmath0 co - location would not be disfavoured .",
    "the combined result of the arguments above is that the lobe expansion of  is likely to be similar to that of the jet - cloud - interacting  source . in both cases the time averaged jet power imparted to pre - existing group gas",
    "is primarily in the form of kinetic and thermal energy of shocked gas .",
    "the eastern displacement with respect to the radio of the x - rays associated with k1 is what is expected if we are seeing hot gas associated with the cloud of previously - known , cooler , optical emission - line gas .",
    "the emission - line cloud was first reported by @xcite .",
    "it was explored further by @xcite who found a mass of about @xmath49 m@xmath4 , and argued on energetic grounds that it was local gas that is being heated and entrained by the jet rather than having been transported from the nucleus .",
    "the x - ray detection makes that conclusion even more solid , since the cloud mass grows by more than an order of magnitude once the mass of the x - ray - emitting envelope is taken into account ( see below ) .",
    "the required spatial resolution for improved mapping of the morphology of the optical gas became available with _ hst _ , and @xcite commented on the cloud s north - south orientation and filamentary appearance based on 1995 observations using the f702w filter [ see also @xcite who incorporated f555 data ] . in figure",

    "we find a density of hydrogen nuclei @xmath50 m@xmath51 , a pressure of @xmath52 pa , and a total x - ray gas mass of @xmath53 m@xmath4 .",
    "if the x - ray gas is not still heated , e.g. , by the radio jet , the cooling time is @xmath54 myr . the average pressure in the group x - ray gas is found to be roughly 10 and 4 @xmath55  pa at radii of 10 and 25 arcsec , respectively .",
    "at a radius of 6 arcsec , comparable to that of the k1 gas cloud we find @xmath56 pa . the group gas can not therefore contain the gas cloud , which should expand and dissipate in the sound crossing time of about 10 myr .",
    "we infer that the cloud was originally cooler material that has been heated to x - ray temperatures within the lifetime of the radio source due to the passage of the jet .",
    "we note that the x - ray properties of the gas cloud are not dissimilar to those found in the closer , and so brighter and better constrained , high ionization cloud ( hic ) interacting with the jet in .",

    "in the hic of  the optical emission lines are narrow and in a high ionization state , with a total flux in [ oiii ] of @xmath60 ergs @xmath14 s@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the narrowness of the lines was unexpected because the jet - cloud interaction appears to be strong , but one of the possible explanations proffered by @xcite is supported by our detection of x - rays associated with the cloud .",
    "the idea is that the optical emission - line gas is not itself shocked , but lies around the shocked structures , and is photoionized by photons emitted by gas behind the shock front .",
    "the [ oiii ] line luminosity is high , at @xmath61 ergs s@xmath6 , but the x - ray luminosity ( extrapolated from the fitted parameter values to include all photons above 13.6  ev ) , at @xmath62 ergs s@xmath6 , can provide a significant fraction of the required photoionizing power .",
    "the gas that is shocked by interaction with the radio jet is likely to be structurally complex , and lower - temperature components ( e.g. , in the ultraviolet ) could plausibly make up any deficit .",
    "the isotropic x - ray luminosity of the nucleus is about @xmath63 ergs s@xmath6 , after correction for the high absorption ( section [ sec : core ] ) .",
    "if the nuclear x - ray spectrum extends to high energy without downwards curvature , this would be an underestimate .",
    "the cloud could intercept about 1 per cent of this luminosity , and so the contribution of ionizing photons from the nucleus will be similar to , or could exceed , the contribution from the x - ray - bright gas at k1 .",
    "we note that @xcite contradicts the high polarization at k1 reported by @xcite , and so there is no evidence that the optical continuum at k1 arises from scattered nuclear light .",
    "we have found above that the x - ray gas cloud can be no older than 10 myr .",
    "it is then interesting to attempt to relate this to the likely age of the radio source . from figure",
    "[ fig : radio ] we see that the southern lobe is morphologically consistent with plasma originating from a jet travelling from k1 to k2 , rather than from an historically un - deflected jet .",
    "although we note that both lobes show more distortion on the east than west , the side on which more of the h@xmath0-emitting filaments mapped by @xcite lie , it seems more plausible that the southern jet was bent early on in the lifetime of the source than being a late - phase re - direction .",
    "this makes  no older than about 10 myr .",
    "such an age fits with the source s relatively small projected linear size and our argument ( unlike for  which is of similar projected size ) that it lies close to the plane of the sky , and so is of relatively small intrinsic size .",
    "the nature of the jet - cloud interaction will be explored further using new integral field unit data from gemini north ( duncan smith et al , work in progress ) .      the x - ray emission associated with k2 peaks upstream of the radio .",
    "this has been seen elsewhere in x - ray synchrotron knots embedded in the jets of nearby radio galaxies , most notably in 3c66b , cena , 3c346 , 3c353 and possibly 3c15 @xcite .",
    "the spectral constraint on the x - ray emission from knot k2 is rather poor and alone does not rule out an origin as either inverse compton emission from electrons of energies similar to those producing the radio synchrotron emission , or synchrotron radiation from high - energy electrons of steeper spectrum .",
    "the deflection at k1 has been interpreted by @xcite in the context of an oblique - shock model to support a pre - shock jet lorentz factor of between 3 and 5 , a post - shock lorentz factor of between 1.1 and 1.5 , and a jet orientation of less than @xmath64 degrees to the line of sight .",
    "even if the post - shock orientation angle is as small as a few degrees ( unlikely due to the x - ray absorption against the nucleus , section [ sec : core ] ) , the doppler factor in k2 will be insufficient to produce the x - ray emission through boosting of inverse - compton scattered photons , as may be important in quasar jets ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . for negligible beaming ,",
    "predictions for synchrotron self - compton emission and compton scattering of cmb photons , based on a minimum - energy magnetic field , fall short of observations by factors of roughly 1300 and 600 , respectively .",
    "however , k2 is only 13 kpc from the nucleus , and starlight will provide additional photons . to estimate their contribution",
    "we have assumed the host galaxy to have similar properties to that for , for which we modelled the local energy density of starlight as a function of position @xcite .",
    "we find an x - ray contribution that is roughly five times the contribution from unscattered cmb radiation  still far below what is required .",
    "we therefore conclude that the x - ray emission in k2 is dominated by synchrotron radiation .",
    "this is the established mechanism for x - rays from  radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "it was first claimed in knots of specific  radio galaxies by @xcite , and is studied in detail in the bright jet of pictor a @xcite .",
    "x - ray synchrotron jet emission is also seen in the  transition source  @xcite , where as in , @xmath65 .",
    "bright nonthermal x - rays on the upstream edge of a radio hotspot ( sections [ sec : overall ] and [ sec : nhot ] ) have been noted previously in other sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a variety of suggested explanations .",
    "indeed an offset is seen in , but with the main difference that the offset in that source is for the hotspot on the jet - side of the source , approaching at small angle to the line of sight . following @xcite ,",
    "@xcite argue that inverse - compton scattering of hotspot synchrotron emission by the approaching jet may provide an explanation for that offset .",

    "the radio map of the n hotspot starts to break into faint radio substructure . @xcite",
    "have suggested , based on vlbi imaging principally of pictor a , that variable pc - scale regions host strong shocks that accelerate electrons to tev energies and give significant x - ray synchrotron emission .",
    "this may be happening in . in a minimum - energy magnetic field",
    "it would take the whole flux density of the hotspot ( about 113 mjy at 4.9 ghz ) in a pc - scale region to produce the x - rays via the synchrotron self - compton mechanism .",
    "instead , overlooking the non - contemporaneous nature of the radio and x - ray data , at most 3  mjy of radio flux density comes from the x - ray - bright region , but this implies @xmath66 , which is similar to the value of @xmath67 in k2 for which we have argued a synchrotron origin .",
    "unfortunately the hotspot x - rays are too faint for us to comment on possible variability between the 2010 and 2014 data , which might address the issue of source size , but more sensitive high - resolution radio mapping closer in date to the x - ray observations could help explore the likely synchrotron origin further .",
    "the radio galaxy  is an ideal test - bed for studying the energy deposition of a radio galaxy typical of those dominating radio - mode feedback in the wider universe , since it has typical power and resides in a typical ( group ) environment .",
    "remnants of cold and excited gas from the merger that probably triggered the radio outburst have previously been studied dynamically through their line emission . in this paper",
    "we have reported the discovery with _",
    "chandra _  of x - ray - emitting gas dominating the baryonic mass of the system both on the group scale and in the jet - cloud interaction region that is responsible for having bent the jet by a projected angle of @xmath2 .",
    "our primary conclusions can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the expanding radio galaxy has been responsible for shocking a pre - existing x - ray group atmosphere which now , to some extent , embraces the lobes .",
    "we estimate the mass of group gas out to a radius of 40 kpc as @xmath42 m@xmath4 .",
    "shock advance in some places is inhibited by the cold merger material .",
    "the kinetic and thermal energy of shocked gas then dominates the overall heat input from the radio galaxy to the external medium .",
    "the emission - line cloud responsible for bending the jet is dominated by x - ray gas of mass about @xmath68 m@xmath4 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the nucleus contains a highly absorbed component arguing that the galaxy lies close to the plane of the sky .",
    "the large projected jet bend is then also a large intrinsic bend .",
    "3 .   the emission - line cloud can be no older than 10 myr or it should have expanded away .",
    "the fact that the radio lobe ( containing old jet material ) is inflated around the post - bend jet direction allows us to date the whole radio source as no older than 10 myr .",
    "the discovery of dominant x - ray - radiating gas associated with the emission - line cloud goes some way to solving the mystery of the narrowness of the optical emission lines in the cloud .",
    "the x - ray material can provide about @xmath69 ergs s@xmath6 to photoionize the cloud , suggesting the optical emission - line gas may be unshocked .",
    "ionizing continuum from the core could provide a similar level of excitation at the cloud .",
    "x - ray emission is detected from the southern jet and northern hotspot , in both cases offset upstream from radio peaks .",
    "we argue that in both cases the x - ray emission is likely to be synchrotron radiation .",
    "the closer source  shares many of the properties of , such as typical radio power , shocked group atmosphere , and is also further enriched by revealing a jet - cloud interaction region .",
    "as compared with , the radio outburst of  is estimated to be somewhat older , there is no longer evidence of large - scale merger gas ( if indeed it existed ) , and the jet - cloud interaction may be younger and more localized , with the jet having multiply scarred the cloud with which it is interacting .",
    "both sources have grown into the plateau stage where they are expected to spend most of their lives , and so can be considered as touchstones for revealing how typical radio - mode heating may occur in the universe .",
