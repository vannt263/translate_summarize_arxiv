    "the origin of the defect band can be understood as follows : each te - cd covalent bond is populated by 0.5 cd electron and 1.5 te electron .",

    "figure [ fig : bandas216jtq0 ] shows both the symmetric and distorted configurations , along with their band diagrams .",
    "the origin of the distortion is not due to the jahn - teller mechanism , because the symmetric state does not present degeneracy . as discussed above for the @xmath19 state , the missing te atom leaves four broken bonds with 0.5 electron each one .",
    "the energy is reduced when two cd atoms loss 0.5 electrons and move to adopt a quasi - planar bonding structure with their three te neighbors .",

    "this case is instructive about the interplay between the different size effects .",
    "the band diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : bandas216jtq2- ] suggests that the band energy is minimized by a downshift of the defect band , that becomes occupied , while the dispersive host - like conduction band gets empty .",
    "this mechanism lowers the total energy by 0.6  ev .",
    "however , the self - consistent energy must be corrected by subtracting the band filling energy , which is -0.87  ev for the undistorted configuration , but it is negligible for the distorted one .",

    "the band filling error is null .",
    "as expected , the distorted configuration in the sc512 relaxes to the non - distorted structure .",

    "this approximation is supported by comparing the corresponding pbe energies and wave functions using different k - point samplings , the @xmath21 point and the @xmath17 mesh .",
    "the effect of changing the pbe functional by the hse06 functional is the shift of the phs energy by 0.4  ev .",
    "in contrast , the defect level is shifted by only -0.07 ev .",
    "additional gw calculations for the primitive cell , show that the cbm is 0.481 ev over the pbe value ( see appendix [ app : qp ] ) . considering that the phs is occupied by two electrons ,",
    "the total energy of the symmetric configuration must be corrected by @xmath44  ev . however , for the distorted configuration the quasiparticle correction is quite small and can be neglected . as a consequence ,",
    "the distorted configuration has the lowest energy .    for the neutral state , there is no need of band filling corrections because there is neither holes in the vb nor electrons in the cb .",
    "therefore the distorted configuration is stable .",
    "the calculation with the model sc512 confirms this result .",
    "moreover , the absence of conduction electrons , valence holes , and net charge , renders quasiparticle corrections unnecessary .",
    "the @xmath45 charge state has one electron occupying the cb in a phs .",
    "the hse06 calculation confirms that the phs has lower energy than the localized defect state .",
    "it seems contradictory that for the @xmath45 state , with one missing electron , the highest occupied level jumps into the cb , while for the @xmath46 state the highest occupied level returns to the vb .",
    "this behavior is due to the strong relaxation of the four neighbor cd atoms into planar configurations cdte@xmath47 , favoring a @xmath40-like hybridization . within a @xmath40 shell structure , each cd atom shares its 2 valence electrons with @xmath48 electrons coming from its three neighboring te , resulting in 0.5 electron in excess of the @xmath40 shell .",
    "adding the four cd atoms , this sums 2 electrons .",
    "the net effect is that two electronic levels are removed ( holes ) .",
    "therefore , the closed - shell structure is recovered in the charge state @xmath46 , while for the state @xmath45 there is one electron in the cb . accordingly , for the @xmath45 charge state , the formation energy must be corrected due to errors in both the conduction band filling and the vb and cb edges . for the latter , @xmath49 and @xmath50",

    "thus , the differences with previous studies @xcite can be easily understood . in fig .  [",
    "fig : vte64 ] , the negatively charged states appear stable for high values of the fermi level because the energies of the excess electrons in the cb is heavily underestimated and , as discussed above , the quasiparticle correction ( eq .",

    "<S> the quantum states and thermodynamical properties of the te vacancy in cdte are addressed by first principles calculations , including the supercell size and quasiparticle corrections . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the 64-atoms supercell calculation is not suitable to model the band structure of the isolated te vacancy . </S>",
    "<S> this problem can be solved with a larger 216-atoms supercell , where the band structure of the defect seems to be a perturbation of that of the perfect crystal . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that the te - vacancy formation energy calculated with both supercell sizes are close in energy , which is attributed to error cancelation . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the interplay between supercell size effects and the band gap underestimation of the generalized gradient approximation strongly influences the predicted symmetry of some charge states . </S>"
