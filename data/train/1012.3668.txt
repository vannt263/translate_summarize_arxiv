    "the spin structure of bound states is a topic of considerable interest in recent years @xcite .",

    "@xcite , a gauge - invariant decomposition of the nucleon angular momentum into the quark spin , orbital and the gluon contributions has been introduced .",
    "the connection between off - forward ( or generalized ) parton distributions and the quark / gluon angular momenta within the proton has been established .",
    "the total angular momentum carried by quarks is measurable through the deeply - virtual compton scattering ( dvcs )  @xcite .",
    "a large amount of works have also been done in studying the angular momentum carried by the gluons , @xmath1 , and several experiments have been designed to measure this quantity and interesting physics has been learnt  @xcite .",
    "while much of the attention has been focused on relativistic theory , it is illuminating to study angular momentum in the non - relativistic limit of qed / qcd .",
    "a clear understanding of the non - relativistic angular momentum structure is useful for many systems , including the hydrogen - like atoms  @xcite and the heavy quarkonium  @xcite bound states .",
    "the fraction of angular momentum carried by the photon in hydrogen atom is relevant to the gluon contribution to the spin of the proton .",
    "since the hydrogen atom is a non - relativistic bound state , the naive perturbation theory of relativistic qed is not applicable because multiple energy scales present . for the ground state ,",
    "the electron has orbital velocity @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the electromagnetic fine - structure constant , therefore the loop expansion in @xmath4 does not converge  @xcite . as another example , in production of electron - positron pairs near the threshold , the interactions are always accompanied with the famous sommerfeld enhancement proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "attempts to calculate these corrections within the relativistic theory is difficult analytically , usually involving numerical solution of the bethe - salpeter equations .",

    "effective theories including non - relativistic qed ( nrqed )  @xcite and the non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) , has become a usual tool in solving non - relativistic bound states .",
    "nrqed has been used to calculate the hyperfine splitting and lamb shift of the hydrogen system with considerable simplification  @xcite .",
    "nrqcd has been used in analyzing the heavy quarkonium inclusive production in colliders  @xcite and precision bound - state calculations on the lattice . by observing that the coulomb interactions exchanging momentum at much lower scale compared to the fermion mass @xmath5",
    ", one can integrate out the large momentum scale , resulting in higher dimensional effective operators suppressed by powers of @xmath6 .",
    "in effective theories , relativistic and radiative corrections to bound state problems can be systematically expanded in terms of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the non - relativistic bound state wavefunction properly sums up all order corrections due to the coulomb photon exchange .",
    "therefore , the nrqed as an effective field theory , is capable of describing the hydrogen atom up to any definite order with desired precision in a language familiar in quantum mechanics .    in the non - relativistic limit , the orbital angular momentum @xmath9 and spin @xmath10 of the electron",
    "are both conserved and can be used to classify the energy eigenstates . moreover ,",
    "the contribution from the gauge potential in the orbital part is proportional to the velocity and hence negligible .",
    "@xmath9 is then the usual non - relativistic angular momentum .",
    "when taking into account the relativistic effects and quantum corrections , the angular momentum operator becomes more complicated .",
    "for example , for relativistic dirac hamiltonian , neither @xmath11 nor @xmath12 maintains as a good quantum due to corrections of order @xmath13 .",
