    "vo@xmath0 in its bulk form displays a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) which occurs near rt ( at approximately 340 k).@xcite this change in the electronic structure is accompanied by a structural distortion that involves the dimerization ( to a low - temperature monoclinic insulating phase ) of the v chains that form in the rutile structure , leading to a v - v singlet state accompanied by the expected reduction of the magnetic susceptibility.@xcite the direct v - v exchange along the chains forms spin - singlets at low temperature , that break up above 340 k leading to a structural distortion , with dimers no longer occurring and v - v distances becoming uniform along the rutile c - axis .",
    "this mit has been widely studied , with effort given to tuning the temperature of the transition,@xcite because its proximity to rt makes it usable for various applications.@xcite    recently oxide interfaces ( if ) have shown interesting ( and not yet well understood ) mits .",
    "one of these happens with a few layers of laalo@xmath8 ( lao ) on top of a srtio@xmath8 ( sto ) substrate . here , the effects of having a polar if come into play , producing an electric field within the lao layer that raises the energies ( bands ) of successive layers .",
    "calculations show that the onset of the overlap of valence band o @xmath9 states at the surface with ti @xmath10 conduction states on the substrate produces an insulator - to - metal transition in the heterostructure around 4 layers of lao grown on an sto substrate,@xcite in agreement with experimental observations .    in this paper we will be dealing with a different mechanism for a mit in an oxide nanostructure .",
    "this transition again happens at very small thicknesses , and involves several factors including the quantum confinement of the electronic states in the vo@xmath0 layers .",
    "experimentally , it was shown that the mit seen in bulk vo@xmath0 is inhibited in these films of vo@xmath0 deposited on tio@xmath0 .",
    "below 5 nm,@xcite there is not enough cooperativity along the z - axis to produce a dimerization of the v - v chains , thus not allowing for an insulating phase to develop .",
    "in addition , the lattice strain induced by the substrate might be strong enough in thin layers to prevent the mit from occurring .",
    "however , when the effects of quantum confinement come into play ( for thicknesses even smaller , on the order of 1 nm ) , the situation may be different .",
    "we have calculated that insulating behavior occurs for very thin layers of vo@xmath0 ( one or two layers ) , and then a very peculiar zero - gap , point fermi surface state emerges for 3 and 4 layers .",
    "metallicity takes over for a thickness of 5 vo@xmath0 layers and beyond .",
    "this metal - insulator transition is not caused by , nor even accompanied by , any strong structural change .",
    "these ifs are non - polar , so this mit differentiates very clearly from that of the lao / sto system , its origin being completely different .",
    "our analysis of the change in electronic structure with vo@xmath0 layer thickness indicates this is not an interfacial phenomenon but rather an effect of confinement of electronic states within the vo@xmath0 layers coupled with specific orbital ordering on the v @xmath3 ions .",
    "our electronic structure calculations were performed within density functional theory @xcite using the all - electron , full potential code wien2k @xcite based on the augmented plane wave plus local orbital ( apw+lo ) basis set.@xcite the exchange - correlation potential utilized to deal with possible strong correlation effects was the lsda+u scheme @xcite including an on - site u and j ( on - site coulomb repulsion and exchange strengths ) for the ti and v @xmath10 states .",
    "the values u= 3.4 ev , j= 0.7 ev have been used for both ti and v to deal properly with correlations in this multilayered structure ; these values are comparable to ( slightly smaller than ) what have been used for bulk vo@xmath0@xcite and other vanadates close to the itinerant limit.@xcite our calculations show that a larger u , of 4 ev , gives an incorrect insulating behavior of bulk vo@xmath0 in rutile structure , hence overestimating electron - electron interactions .",
    "spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) effects are discussed in the last section .",
    "the multilayer system ( tio@xmath0)@xmath1/(vo@xmath0)@xmath2 ( we will refer to it as m / n for simplicity ) , formed by @xmath11 tio@xmath0 monolayers and @xmath5 vo@xmath0 monolayers grown along the rutile ( 001 ) direction , is calculated to undergo a mit when @xmath11 is sufficiently large to confine vo@xmath0 to two - dimensionality , that is , to prevent direct interactions between successive vo@xmath0 slabs . five layers of tio@xmath0 ( or approximately 1.5 nm thickness ) is more than sufficient , and that is what we use for our discussion . to follow this mit we will analyze one by one different @xmath5 values from 1 to 5 , from insulator for small @xmath5 to a metal for @xmath5 of 5 or greater .",

    ", the @xmath25-bond along the chain and dimerization leads to a spin - singlet formation along the chain , resulting in a gap . in the case of multilayers of the thickness we consider ( and even larger ) ,",

    "the band structure of the 5/2 system in a fm state along the rutile c - axis is included as the left panel of fig .",

    "when comparing this 5/2 system to 5/1 and 5/3 , it can be seen how the bands that cross at the semi - dirac point in the 5/3 system are approaching this energy region already in the 5/2 system .",
    "the fm configuration in this 5/2 case is not the lowest energy state , but it will be useful to see this reference band structure for understanding the origin of the semi - dirac point fermi surface that appears in the 5/3 and 5/4 ml systems , as shown in the middle two panels of fig .",
    "[ bs_5_n ] .",
    "when comparing the 5/2 and 5/1 band structures , we see a new set of two v occupied bands , similar to those present in the 5/1 band structure , but with smaller bandwidth , and a corresponding reduction in the band gap of the full multilayer system can be observed .",
    "it is already clear that adding more layers of vo@xmath0 will lead to a metallic state .            to provide the sequence up to , at , and beyond the semi - dirac cases , figure [ bs_5_n ] shows the band structures of the ( tio@xmath0)@xmath15/(vo@xmath0)@xmath2 system for values of @xmath5 from 2 to 5 , from left to right .",
    "the alignment of energies in the various band structures presented in this figure was carried out using as a reference the o @xmath26 core state of the central oxygen in the ( tio@xmath0)@xmath15 layer . using that reference , the occupied oxygen bands coming from the tio@xmath0 layer are about the same position in energy , but the fermi levels are not aligned .",
    "nevertheless , the fermi levels for @xmath5 = 3 , 4 , 5 are very nearly aligned , as would be expected once a metallic band structure is established .    as presented and discussed earlier@xcite the 5/3 system displays a very peculiar electronic structure not seen previously , consisting of a semi - dirac dispersion around the point fermi surface .",
    "the dispersion is massless ( linear ) along the ( 1,1 ) symmetry direction in k - space , and massive ( quadratic ) perpendicular to this direction at the semi - dirac point .",
    "such an unusual dispersion will lead to unexpected and unique physical properties,@xcite many of which remain to be studied .",
    "the origin of these peculiar fermi points arises from a specific coupling of two bands related to the change in orbital ordering from the first unit cell to deeper cells .",
    "the change in orientation is the same in the 5/3 system as is pictured in the 5/5 system in fig .",

    "there are two pairs of bands , each with its own identifiable shape , that can be used to follow the formation and then the disappearance of the semi - dirac band structure .",
    "the occupied pair in the 5/1 system was discussed above , and it appears twice in the 5/2 system , with centers displaced by about 0.4 ev . in the 5/3 system , a new pair of bands appears , which their character reveals to be a mixture of bands coming from v sites that are _ not _ at the interface .",
    "this pair of bands can be identified also in the 5/2 band structure , where they are the lowest pair of unoccupied states at the m point .",
    "these bands disperse in opposite directions from the m point , and the upper member crosses a band that is dispersing downward from above .",
    "this crossing gives rise to the semi - dirac point . since the crossing bands do not involve the interface v sites , and does not survive for more than four unit cells of vo@xmath0 , the semi - dirac phenomenon qualifies as a quantum confinement effect rather than an interfacial effect .",

    "the distortion of the octahedron , and the two orientations of octahedra , in the rutile structure , make this orbital difficult to quantify in terms of the cubic @xmath10 orbitals , and also complicate the tight - binding representation of what appear to be simply dispersing pairs of bands",

    "the fm configuration is lower in energy than an antiferromagnetic alignment along the rutile c - axis , by 57 mev / v .",
    "this disfavoring of af ordering is consistent with the experimental observation that long - range dimer formation along the rutile c axis only occurs at vo@xmath0 thicknesses of several nm,@xcite enough to sustain a dimerization and structural cooperative distortion of the rutile - based lattice .",
    "just as in the 5/3 system , this nanostructure has a half metallic zero - gap semi - dirac structure .",
    "figure [ dos_5_4 ] shows the partial density of states ( dos ) of the four inequivalent v atoms , and the two central cells are different from those at the interface . for labeling the atom - projected dos curves ,",
    "the v atoms are named as v1-v2-v3-v4-v4-v3-v2-v1 from interface to interface along the rutile @xmath7 axis .",
    "the two innermost v atoms v3 and v4 contribute most to the dos near the fermi level , but very near the fermi level a contribution from v2 ( the more inner atom in the interfacial unit cell ) becomes noticeable .",

    "the other sets of bands , which come from the more internal vo@xmath0 layers , are very similar to the 5/3 case .",

    "there are in fact several interesting complications in this system .    first of all , this three - cell layer of vo@xmath0 is not only magnetic ( unlike graphene ) , but it is half - metallic .",
    "the nearest minority bands that can be mixed by soc into the majority bands at the semi - dirac point are 1 ev away .",
    "_ @xcite have studied the effects of soc in some intermetallic half metals , but without reporting on the size of any band gaps that might have resulted .",
    "they found that the amount of mixing ( in terms of dos ) of minority into the majority band gap could range from 0.5% to a little more than 10% , depending on the size of the half metallic gap , the position of the fermi level in the gap , etc . as a result of soc ,",
    "half metals are no longer strictly 100% half metallic due to spin mixing .",
    "second , our system is strongly two dimensional , and even the underlying rutile structure is anisotropic , especially in vo@xmath0 where the spin coupling along the @xmath7-axis is strongly tied to the structural transition and insulator - to - metal transition.@xcite however , unlike in graphene , there is a real underlying three - dimensional lattice in the present case .",
