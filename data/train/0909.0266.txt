    "the recent cosmological observations give evidence for the presence of a cosmological matter density , which represents about 27% of the total density of the universe , and the presence of the so - called dark energy . using the total matter density observed by wmap @xcite and the baryon density indicated by big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite and including the theoretical uncertainties , the dark matter density range at 95% c.l .",
    "is deduced @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the reduced hubble constant . in the following ,",
    "we also refer to the older range @xcite @xmath2 in supersymmetric models the lightest stable supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) constitutes the favorite candidate for dark matter . if the relic density can be calculated precisely , the accuracy of the latest wmap data can therefore be used to constrain the supersymmetric parameters .",
    "the computation of the relic density is well - known within the standard model of cosmology @xcite , and is implemented in automatic codes , such as micromegas @xcite , darksusy @xcite or superiso relic @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the nature of the dark energy and the properties of the universe in the pre - bbn epoch are still unknown , and the bbn era , at temperatures of about 1 mev , is the oldest period in the cosmological evolution when reliable constraints are derived .",
    "the cosmology of the primordial universe could therefore be much more complex , and the pre - bbn era could have for example experienced a slower or faster expansion .",
    "such a modified expansion , even though still compatible with the bbn or the wmap results , would change the lsp freeze - out time and the amount of relic density ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "a similar question exists concerning the entropy content of the universe at that period , and the eventual consequences on the energy conservation in the primodial epochs ( see for example @xcite ) .    in the following",
    ", we will first describe the way the relic density is calculated in the standard cosmology .",
    "we will then present how the calculations can be modified in altered cosmological scenarios .",
    "we then analyze the consequences of the cosmological uncertainties on the supersymmetric parameter searches .",
    "we also inverse the problem and show that the determination of a beyond the standard model particle physics scenario will give hints on the cosmological properties of the early universe .",
    "finally , we will present the superiso relic package and conclude .",
    "the cosmological standard model is based on a friedmann - lematre universe , approximately flat , incorporating a cosmological constant accelerating its expansion , and filled with radiation , baryonic matter and cold dark matter . before bbn ,",
    "the universe expansion is dominated by the radiation density , and therefore the expansion rate @xmath3 of the universe is determined by the friedmann equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the radiation density and @xmath6 is the effective number of degrees of freedom of radiation .",
    "the computation of the relic density is based on the solution of the boltzmann evolution equation @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number density of all supersymmetric particles , @xmath9 their equilibrium density , and @xmath10 is the thermal average of the annihilation rate of the supersymmetric particles to the standard model particles . by solving this equation ,",

    "the computation of the thermally averaged annihilation cross section @xmath11 requires the computation of the many annihilation and co - annihilation amplitudes .",
    "the annihilation rate of supersymmetric particles @xmath12 and @xmath13 into sm particles @xmath14 and @xmath15 is defined as @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the transition amplitude , @xmath18 the center - of - mass energy , @xmath19 the number of degrees of freedom of the particle @xmath12 and @xmath20 the final center - of - mass momentum such as @xmath21^{1/2 } \\left[s-(m_k - m_l)^2\\right]^{1/2}}{2\\sqrt{s}}\\;.\\ ] ] @xmath22 in eq .",

    "about 250,000 random susy points in the nuhm parameter plane ( @xmath82,@xmath83 ) are generated using softsusy v2.0.18 @xcite , and for each point we compute flavor physics observables , direct limits and the relic density with superiso relic v2.7 @xcite . in fig .",

    "all these exclusions are related to particle physics and are subject to uncertainties which are under control .",
    "the dark ( light ) blue zones are _ favored _ by the wmap ( old ) dark matter constraints .",
    "hence , in the top left figure for example , which corresponds to the standard cosmological model , only tiny strips remain compatible with all the displayed constraints , and the relic density observable happens to be extremely constraining .",

    "the relic density favored areas are this time moved outwards with different shapes .    from these two analyses ,",
    "it is clear that the relic density calculations can be strongly altered by the presence of entropy or energy densities , even very small or negligible at the bbn time ( _ i.e. _ completely unobservable in the current cosmological data ) .",
    "thus , cosmological unknown properties of the early universe can completely change the favored susy parameter space , and could lead to erroneous affirmations on the properties of the susy particles .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that it is critical to use the relic density to constrain susy .",
    "however the problem can be inverted : the future colliders will give the possibility to determine the new physics and relic particle properties @xcite , and by calculating the relic density in different cosmological scenarios it would be possible to determine or to verify some of the physical properties of the early universe .",
    "in such cases , combining the relic density constraints with the bbn limits would remove some of the degeneracies .     in presence of additional dark entropy and energy for @xmath98 , @xmath87 , @xmath97 , @xmath95 ( left ) and @xmath99 , @xmath92 , @xmath97 , @xmath93 ( right ) .",
