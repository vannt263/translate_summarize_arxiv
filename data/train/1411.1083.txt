    "in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , gluons have strong interactions with each other and can form a new type of hadron , the glueball , which is distinct from the conventional @xmath1 mesons in the picture of the quark model . however , there is not yet a reliable theoretical description of the intrinsic degrees of freedom of glueballs .",
    "phenomenologically , two - gluon glueballs are the simplest low - energy color singlet systems made up of gluons , whose @xmath2 quantum numbers are expected to be @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , etc .",
    "( @xmath6 quantum number does not appear for two - gluon glueballs if the constituent gluons are massless ) .",
    "these arguments are in qualitative agreement with the pattern of the glueball spectrum obtained by lattice qcd calculations  @xcite , where the lowest - lying states are @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 glueballs in the order of mass from low to high . as for the gluon dynamics inside glueballs , there are various effective approaches such as the bag model  @xcite , qcd in coulomb gauge  @xcite , and potential models  @xcite .",
    "the potential models depict a glueball as a bound state of two or more constituent gluons through a confining interacting potential .",
    "even though still controversial , the potential models with proper theoretical assumptions can reproduce the glueball spectrum from lattice qcd .",
    "apart from the spectrum , some other static properties of glueballs , such as the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) wave functions , can also be investigated through lattice qcd studies , from which one can infer some qualitative information on the sizes and the spatial profiles of glueballs . for a glueball dominated by a two - gluon component , the bs wave function is defined through the matrix element of a two - gluon operator @xmath7 between the glueball state and the vacuum , which can be derived from the relevant two - point function calculated in lattice qcd .",
    "this kind of wave function may reflect the spatial structure of a hadron to some extent .",
    "since the two - gluon operator @xmath7 is obviously gauge variant , the related calculation should be performed in a fixed gauge , for example , the coulomb gauge . the pioneering study on this topic",
    "was carried out for the @xmath8 pure gauge glueballs  @xcite . a similar study on @xmath0 glueballs",
    "can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are actually phenomenological studies  @xcite on the gluon dynamics within glueballs by the use of the bs wave functions obtained from lattice qcd calculations , where the positive c - parity states are taken as mainly two - gluon states and the interacting potential between the constituent gluons is extracted .",
    "however , the previous lattice studies focus only on ground states and the results are not precise enough , thus a more scrutinized analysis is desired for the bs wave functions of both the ground and the excited states .",
    "this is exactly the major goal of this work .",
    "it is known that the key point in the calculation of the matrix elements mentioned above is to identify the glueball states unambiguously . in order for this",
    ", we adopt the sophisticated technique used in the glueball spectrum study  @xcite .",
    "this technique implements the variational method based on large operator sets for glueballs , through which the ground and the first excited states can be well determined .",
    "finally , the bs wave functions of all the glueball states are derived to a high precision .",
    "we hope our results can provide more information to the understanding of the nature of glueballs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ two - gluon operators ] gives a detailed introduction to the definition of two - gluon operators on the lattice .",
    "section  [ numerical details ] contains the numerical details in calculating the bs wave functions . in section  [ numerical details ]",
    "we also discuss the parameterizations of the wave functions and the corresponding physical implications .",
    "a brief summary is given in section  [ summary ] .",
    "it is known that the bethe - salpeter equation  @xcite provides a relativistic description of a two - body system where the relativistic bethe - salpeter ( bs ) wave function of a bound state can then be defined .",
    "for a two - gluon glueball state @xmath9 in its rest frame , the bs wave function can be expressed as @xcite : [ wavefunc ] _ g(r)=0| _ , ( , ) _",
    "||=r , y_lm()a_()a_(+)|g , where @xmath10 stands for the spatial orientation of @xmath11 , the summations on @xmath12 and @xmath13 guarantee the right quantum number of the state @xmath9 , and the gauge field @xmath14 acts as the creation operator for a gluon . since the fundamental gluonic variables on the lattice are the gauge links @xmath15 instead of @xmath16 , one has to build the lattice counterpart of the two - gluon operator @xmath17 through gauge links @xmath18 .",
    "the gauge field @xmath19 can be directly defined as @xmath20(1 + o(a^2))\\ ] ] by the use of the relations @xmath21 and the classical small-@xmath22 expansion of @xmath15 .",
    "the two - gluon operator through this way is denoted as @xmath23 in this work . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors propose an alternative definition of the two - gluon operators ( denoted as @xmath24 ) @xmath25\\nonumber\\\\                                         & -\\frac{1}{3}retr[u_\\mu(x)]\\cdot retr[u_\\nu(x+\\vec{r})]\\\\                                         & = ( ag)^2a_\\mu(x)a_\\nu(x+\\vec{r})+\\mathcal{o}(a^4 ) ,    \\end{split}\\ ] ] and claim that this definition reduces the possible mixing with the flux states .",
    "although flux states do not appear in this work ( see below ) , we also carry out the relevant calculation using @xmath24 to check the possible lattice artifacts owing to the different definitions of the two - gluon operators .",
    "however , the classical expansion of @xmath18 is not very justified due to the tadpole diagrams if the quantum effects are considered . in view of this fact",

    "although the correspondences of these irreducible representations to the angular momenta @xmath36 are not unique , it is always conjectured that the lowest states in each symmetry channel @xmath27 correspond to the states with lowest @xmath36 s in the continuum . to be specific , the quantum number of the scalar glueball ( @xmath37 )",

    "we do observe the radial nodes for all these wave functions , which can be viewed as a strong evidence that the excited glueball is the first radial excited state of the ground glueball in each channel .",
    "inspired by the function form of the two - body non - relativistic schrdinger equation , we parameterize the wave functions of the first excited states as follows , [ excitedwave ] _ 2(r)=_2(0)(1-r^)e^-()^ , where the parameter @xmath54 depends on the type of the interacting potential ( for example , @xmath55 for the coulomb potential and @xmath56 for the harmonious oscillator potential ) .",

    "it is interesting that @xmath54 and @xmath57 in the tensor channel ( @xmath40 and @xmath39 ) are close to those of the ground state .",
    "especially , @xmath54 is still close to 2 , which resembles the case for the harmonious oscillator potential model . for the first excited state of the scalar glueball , the fitted parameter @xmath54 deviates from 2 a little .",
    "the reason for this is not clear yet .",
    "recalling that the size of ground scalar glueball is as small as 0.127 fm , while the lattice spacings we are using are comparable to it or even larger , so a possibility is that the radial behavior of the first excited scalar glueball is not extracted accurately enough .",
    "the bethe - salpeter wave functions of the pure gauge scalar and tensor glueballs are revisited in this work .",
    "the feature of this study is the precise identification of the ground and the first excited glueball states in these two channels through the variational method based on large operator sets .",
    "we test the different definitions of two - gluon operators and find no sizable difference , which implies the finite lattice spacing artifacts are small due to the implementation of the improved gauge action .",
    "this is also reinforced by checking the results from two lattices with different lattice spacings .    with large statistics ,",
    "the bs wave functions of both the ground and the first excited states in the scalar and tensor channels are extracted precisely . instead of the exponential fall - off of the wave functions observed in previous works , we find that the wave functions of the ground states are gaussian - like .",
    "the size of the ground state tensor glueball is roughly twice as large as that of the ground state scalar glueball .",
    "for the first time , we observe the radial nodes of wave functions of the first excited states , which support them as the first radial excitations .",
    "we use the function forms inspired by potential models to parameterize the wave functions , and the fitted parameters show that the wave functions of the ground and the first excited state in the tensor channel are compatible with the @xmath59 and @xmath60 wave functions of a harmonious oscillator .",
    "these observations are helpful for a qualitative understanding of the inner structure of glueballs .",
    "furthermore , there have been quite a few phenomenological studies on glueballs in the picture of potential models  @xcite , which use the scalar glueball wave function as an input to derive the interacting potential between constituent gluons .",
