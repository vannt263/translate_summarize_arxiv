    "multiparticle production ( mp ) is one of the most important topics in high energy physics . using mp",
    "we can get more information about the nature of strong interactions and understand deeper the structure of matter . over the last few years",
    "many thorough reviews devoted to mp have been done @xcite .",
    "modern accelerators have made it possible to study mp more extensively and in detail .",
    "developing theory of high energy physics quantum chromodynamics  ( qcd ) @xcite and a lot of phenomenologic models are tested by the process of mp .",
    "multiparticle processes begin at high energy . among all producing particles",
    "we can observe a lot of hadrons .",
    "on one hand we want to know high energy physics , but on the other hand the increase of the inelastic channels makes it difficult to describe this process with customary methods .",
    "the situation concerning the history of thermodynamics developing and statistical physics is much the same .",
    "analysis of mp process is carried out using of statistical methods because the number of secondaries in @xmath0 annihilation is large ( more than 60 ) @xcite .",
    "the consideration of mp begins from the behavior of charged multiplicity .",
    "as it is generally known the multiplicity is the number of secondaries * n * in process of mp : @xmath4 .",
    "the multiplicity distribution ( md ) @xmath5 is the ratio of cross - sections @xmath6 to @xmath7 : @xmath8 this quantity has the following meaning : the probability of producing of @xmath9 charged particles in this process",
    ". we can also construct quantities such as mean values , moments of md , can study correlations and so on .",
    "investigation of mp has led to discovery of jets .",
    "jets phenomena can be studied in all processes , where energetic partons are produced .",
    "the most common ones are in @xmath0 annihilation , deep inelastic scattering of @xmath10 , @xmath11 or @xmath12 on nucleons and hadron- hadron scattering , involving high-@xmath13 particles in final state .",
    "let us consider @xmath0 -annihilation at high energy .",
    "this process is one of the most suitable for the study of mp . in accordance with qcd",
    "it can be realized through the production of @xmath14 or @xmath15boson into two quarks :    @xmath16    perturbative qcd can describe the process of fission partons ( quarks and gluons ) at high energy , because the strong coupling @xmath17 is small at that energy .",
    "this stage can be called as the stage of cascade . after hard fission ,",
    "when partons have not high energy , they must be changed into hadrons , which we can observe . on this stage",
    "we should nt apply perturbative qcd .",
    "therefore phenomenological models are used for description of hadronization ( transformation of quarks and gluons into hadrons ) in this case .",
    "the description of the stage quark - gluon cascade by means of perturbative qcd was applied in .",
    "certain features of the predictions at the parton level are expected to be insensitive to details of the hadronization mechanism .",
    "they were tested directly by using hadron distributions @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0reaction is simple for analysis , as the produced state is pure @xmath18 .",
    "it is usually difficult to determine the quark species on event - by - event basis .",
    "the experimental results are averaged over the quark type . because of confinement the produced quark and gluons fragment into jets of observable hadrons .",
    "the hadronization models are more phenomenological and are built on the experience gained from the study of low@xmath19 hadron collisions.it is usually considered that the producing of hadrons from partons is universal process .",
    "parton spectra in qcd quark and gluon jets were studied by konishi  k. , ukawa  a. and veneciano  g.@xcite .",
    "working at the leading logarithm approximation and avoiding ir divergences by considering finite @xmath20 , the probabilistic nature of the problem has been established @xcite .    at the studying of mp at high energy we used idea of a.  giovannini  @xcite for description of quark - gluon jets as markov branching processes .",
    "giovannini proposed to interpret the natural qcd evolution parameter @xmath21 @xmath22 , \\ ] ] where @xmath23 for a theory with @xmath24 colours and @xmath25 flavours , as the thickness of the jets and their development as markov process .",
    "three elementary processes contribute into qcd jets : + ( 1 ) gluon fission ; + ( 2 ) quark bremsstrahlung ; + ( 3 ) quark pair creation .",
    "let @xmath26 be the probability that gluon in the infinitesimal interval @xmath27 will convert into two gluons , @xmath28 be the probability that quark will radiate a gluon , and @xmath29 be the probability that a quark - antiquark pair will be created from a gluon .",
    "@xmath30 are assumed to be * y*-independent constants and each individual parton acts independently from others , always with the same infinitesimal probability .",
    "let us define the probability that parton will be transformed into @xmath31  gluons over a jet of y in thickness and call it @xmath32 .",
    "the probability generating function for a parton jet will be    @xmath33    a.giovannini constructed system of differential equations and obtained explicit solutions of md for a parton jet in particular case @xmath34 ( process of quark pair creation is absent ) in the common case @xmath35 md are similar to particular one @xcite .    for quark jet explicit solutions are given @xcite @xmath36    @xmath37    where @xmath38 .",

    "second correlation moments were negative at this energy .",
    "the choise of such distributions was the only could describe experiment .",
    "we suppose that hypothesis of soft colourless is right . we add stage of hadronization to parton stage with aid of it s factorization .",
    "md in this process can be written @xmath43 where @xmath44 is md for partons ( [ 4 ] ) , @xmath45 - md for hadrons produced from @xmath31 partons on the stage of hadronization .",
    "futher we will use instead of parameter @xmath46 cm(center of masses ) energy @xmath47 .    in accordance with tsm the stage of hard fission of partons",
    "is described by negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) for quark jet @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "we neglect process ( 3 ) quark pair production ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "two quarks fracture to partons independently of one another .",
    "total md of two quarks is equal to ( [ 7 ] ) too . parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 of md for two joint quark - antiguark jets are doubled , but we use that designations .",

    "md of hadrons in @xmath0 annihilation are determined by convolution of two stages @xmath62 where @xmath63 is total number of partons ( two quarks and @xmath31 gluons ) .",
    "further we do the following simplification for the second stage : @xmath64 , considering that probabilities of formation of hadron from quark or gluon are equal .",
    "we introduce parameter @xmath65 for distinguishing between hadron jets , created from quark or gluon on the second stage .",

    "the description of experimental md @xcite by ( [ 15 ] ) gives @xmath79 @xmath80 1 for the most energies with the expection of @xmath81gev and @xmath82gev ( more high @xmath79 ) , @xmath83 .",
    "calculated md are giving small deviations from experimental data at @xmath81gev , but for almost all multiplicities ( fig.3 ) .",
    "probably it is connected with small statistics of events .    at @xmath82gev",
    "they give big deviations , but only to the right side of central region ( fig.7 ) .",
    "it can be described as energy suppression of formation of hard gluons connected with appearance of heavy @xmath84 pair or heavy hadrons .",

    "parameters of tsm .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we will analyse dynamics of mp which corresponds to values of parameters of tsm @xmath86 ( table  1 ) .",
    "we will begin from a cascade stage .",
    "this stage is described by two parameters : @xmath87 and @xmath51 .",
    "the average multiplicity of gluons @xmath88 formed on fission stage has tendency to rise .",
    "it is changed from @xmath89 at @xmath1gev to @xmath90 at @xmath91 gev .",
    "but we can see certain insignificant deviation from this direction at @xmath47=@xmath92gev , @xmath93 at @xmath91 gev .",
    "it followes from qcd that in particular case ( @xmath34 ) the parameter @xmath51 that equal to ratio @xmath94 .",
    "values @xmath51 are changed insignificantly .",
    "they are remained @xmath95 at almost all energies .",
    "there is some physical senses of this parameter .",
    "one of the most interesting from them is temperature @xmath96 @xcite : @xmath97 . from thermodynamical models",
    "we can also obtain the following connection    @xmath98    where @xmath99 is the temperature of system before interaction , @xmath100 - thermal capacity , @xmath101 - energy spended on creationg new particles @xcite . in this sense",
    "we can make assumptions : temperature of parton system with developed cascad are lowest at @xmath1 and @xmath102 than at the others .",
    "the highest temperatures are reached on first stage at @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath77 and @xmath105 .",
    "the interesting picture of hadronization is discovered in conformity with parameters of second stage @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the parameter @xmath106 determines maximum number of hadrons , which can be formed from quark on this stage . in tsm ( table 1 )",
    "it takes different values from @xmath109 to @xmath82 .",
    "we ca nt reveal steady energy rise or fall for it .",
    "big @xmath106 point to predominance of hadrons formed from quark jets , small @xmath106 point to essential contribution gluon jets in the hadron multiplicity .",
    "more probably that this parameter remaines constant and @xmath110 with small deviations .",
    "next parameter @xmath107 has meaning of mean hadron multiplicity from quark on second stage .",
    "we can see the tendency to weak rise with big scatter .",
    "such behavior of parameter may be connected with the growth of spectrum of mass hadron states ( appearance of new mass states with increase of energy ) .",
    "the average value of @xmath107 is about @xmath111 in the research region .",
    "parameter @xmath108 was introduced for comparision quark and gluon jets .",
    "it is almost constant and equal to @xmath112 with some deviations .",
    "if we know @xmath108 then we can determine analogous parameters @xmath113 and @xmath114 for gluon jet .",
    "it is interesting that these parameters remain constant without considerable deviations : @xmath115 and @xmath116 ( figures 19 and 20 ) . from this result",
    "we can affirm about universality of hadronization .",
    "the fact that @xmath117 says that hadronization of gluon jets are more soft than quark one .",
    "the simplest explanation to this phenomenon is the fact that a quark takes away more conciderable energy than gluon .",
    "the ratio @xmath118 determines the probability of formation of hadron from parton .",
    "it is increased from @xmath119 to @xmath120.5 with rise of energy from @xmath1 to @xmath121gev , then we have big variations in region @xmath92 gev ( @xmath122 ) and the ratio is almost constant at higher energies ( @xmath123 ) ( figure 21 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the small probabilities are realized at @xmath82gev ( in the region @xmath92gev ) and at @xmath91gev .",
    "the normalized factor @xmath72 remains constant and is equal to 2 .",
    "it was shown recently @xcite that the ratio of factorial cumulative moments over factorial moments changes sign as a function of order .",
    "we can use md formed in tsm for explanation of this phenomenon .",
    "the factorial moments can be obtained from md @xmath124 through the relation @xmath125 and factorial cumulative moments are found from expression @xmath126 the ratio of their quantities is @xmath127 we can use the generating function for md of hadrons ( [ 14 ] ) in @xmath0 annihilation g(z ) @xmath128^m q^2_q(z)=\\ ] ] @xmath129 we are calculating @xmath130 and @xmath131 in tsm using ( [ 20 ] ) @xmath132 @xmath133 the expression([20 ] ) for g(z ) after taking a logarithm @xmath134 + 2\\ln q^h_q\\ ] ] and the expansion to series in power on @xmath135 will be @xmath136 inserting @xmath137 into ( [ 23 ] ) @xmath138^{\\alpha mn}+\\ ] ] @xmath139,\\ ] ] and using ( [ 22 ] ) we obtain @xmath140 @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the average multiplicity hadrons in process ( [ 1 ] ) .",

    "the sought - for expression for @xmath145 will be @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the normalized factor .",
    "the comparison with experimental data @xcite shows that ( [ 26 ] ) describes the ratio of factorial moments ( figures 22 - 39 ) .",
    "it is seen minimum at q=5 .    in the region before @xmath15 @xmath145 may oscillate in sign only with the period equal @xmath148 , changed sign with parity @xmath149 . at more high energies the period",
    "is increased to @xmath109 and higher .",
    "it can be explained by influence of hadronization .",
    "values @xmath131 ( as well @xmath145 ) may change sign only owing to second summand in ( [ 24 ] ) .",
    "more devoloped cascad of partons with hadronization comes to big period of oscillations of sign .",
    "the immediate calculations @xmath145 based on ( [ 17])-([19 ] ) with using md([15 ] ) gives very good description of the oscillation value of @xmath145 ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "significant oscillations start near region producing of @xmath15 and can be explained by non - integer values of parameters of hadronization @xmath106 and @xmath113 or by convolution of wide ( for parton jets ) and narrow ( for hadron jets on second stage ) md .",
