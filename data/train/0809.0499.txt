    "the finding of superconductivity in f doped lafeaso by kamihara and co - workers @xcite has led to considerable interest as this provides an alternative non - cuprate route to high critical temperature ( @xmath3 ) superconductivity . since this finding",
    ", high @xmath3 superconductivity has been found in many related phases that can be generally characterized into four different groups according to their parent compounds : ( i ) lafeaso,@xcite ( ii ) bafe@xmath0as@xmath0,@xcite ( iii ) lifeas,@xcite and ( iv ) @xmath4-fese.@xcite the precise mechanism of superconductivity in these compounds is yet to be established , but is strongly thought to be unconventional .",
    "this is based in part on calculations of the electron - phonon coupling , @xcite which is too small to account for any appreciable superconductivity and on the proximity to magnetism .",
    "@xcite these compounds show considerable variation in doping levels ( i.e. hole or electron doped ) , applied pressure , and chemistry of the non - fe layers , while remaining superconducting .",
    "however , there are three main threads joining these compounds together .",
    "the parent compounds have spin density wave ( sdw ) order with the possible exception of the lifeas phase , exist in a tetragonal structure and possess iron in a 2d square lattice sheet .",
    "there is a clear association between suppression of the sdw order and appearance of superconductivity in the phase diagrams , although recent work does show some range of coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity .",
    "@xcite importantly , the sdw phase is accompanied by an orthorhombic distortion . depending on the specific material ,",
    "this distortion occurs at a temperature higher than the sdw ordering temperature or coincident with it .",
    "@xcite    in addition , ronning _",
    "_  recently reported both the occurrence of a first order phase transition at @xmath5 k with characteristics similar to the structural transition seen in the fe - as based superconductors , and a superconducting transition with @xmath6 k in bani@xmath0as@xmath0.@xcite since fe and ni are ambient temperature ferromagnets and many fe and ni compounds show magnetism , it is plausible to expect that ni can fill in the role of fe in these compounds .",
    "indeed , superconductivity is also observed in lanipo,@xcite laniaso,@xcite and lanibio.@xcite however , these compounds do not display the structural or magnetic transitions characteristic of the fe - as based parent compounds .",
    "moreover , it was recently shown that lanipo can be explained as a conventional electron - phonon superconductor.@xcite    in this paper we report the details of our calculations of the electronic structure , phonons and electron - phonon coupling of bani@xmath0as@xmath0 . the band structure of bani@xmath0as@xmath0 is similar to that reported for bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , @xcite but the fermi level is shifted up owing to the higher valence electron count in ni@xmath7 than in fe@xmath8 . hence , with a larger fermi surface and higher carrier density , bani@xmath0as@xmath0 has remarkably different electronic properties from bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 . a similar increase in the fermi surface area is also found in lanipo for essentially the same reason.@xcite also similar to case of lanipo , we obtain a much larger value of electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath9 in bani@xmath0as@xmath0 compared to the fe based compounds ( for example , in lafeaso @xmath10@xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the mechanism of superconductivity in bani@xmath0as@xmath0 is similar to that of lanipo and is different from the fe based compounds .",
    "the electronic structure calculations were performed within the local density approximation ( lda ) with the general potential linearized augmented planewave ( lapw ) method,@xcite similar to the calculations reported for lafeaso.@xcite we used lapw spheres of radius 2.2 @xmath11 for ba and 2.1 @xmath11 for ni and as .",
    "bani@xmath0as@xmath0 occurs in a body centered tetragonal structure ( @xmath12 ) with ba , ni and as at the positions 2a(0,0,0 ) , 4d(0.5,0,0.5 ) and 4e(0,0,@xmath13 ) , respectively . here",
    "@xmath13 , the as height above the ni square planes , is a structural parameter governing the ni - as distance and the distortion of the as tetrahedra that coordinate the ni in this material . in our calculations , we used experimental lattice parameters ( @xmath14   and @xmath15 )@xcite but employed the computed @xmath13 obtained via non - spin polarized energy minimization .",
    "the phonon dispersions and electron - phonon coupling were calculated using linear response as implemented in quantum espresso code,@xcite similar to the calculations reported for lafeaso and lanipo . @xcite the linear response calculations were also done with experimental lattice parameters , using ultrasoft pseudopotentials within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of perdew , burke and ernzerhof.@xcite an 8x8x8 grid was used for the zone integration in the phonon calculations , while a more dense 32x32x8 grid was used for the zone integration in the electron - phonon coupling calculations .",
    "the basis set cut - off for the wave functions was 40 ry , while a 400 ry cut - off was used for the charge density .",
    "the internal parameter @xmath13 was again relaxed in the calculation of phonon properties .",
    "the values we obtained for @xmath13 ( lda : 0.346 , gga : 0.351 ) agree well with the experimental value of @xmath16 .",
    "this is in contrast to bafe@xmath0as@xmath17@xcite and other fe based superconductors where lda and gga calculations done in this way noticeably underestimate @xmath13 , but is similar to the case of lanipo .",
    "it has been suggested that this underestimation of @xmath13 in fe based superconductors is due to its coupling with magnetism.@xcite this underestimation may be indicative of strong spin fluctuations in the paramagnetic superconducting parts of the phase diagrams of the fe - based materials .",
    "the absence of this discrepancy between the experimental and calculated value of @xmath13 in bani@xmath0as@xmath0 then indicates that the magnetic character of bani@xmath0as@xmath0 is different from that of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 and other fe based superconductors .",

    "[ fig : pdos - a2f ] , we can see that the electron - phonon spectral function is enhanced relative to the phonon density of states in the low frequency modes . the projected phonon density of states plots ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pdos - a2f ] , middle and bottom ) show that this enhancement occurs in the region where there is high ni and as character , although the enhancement can not be attributed to solely in - plane or out - of - plane character .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of lafeaso where the spectral function more closely follows in proportionality to the phonon density of states in this energy region.@xcite it should be noted that doped lafeaso was shown to have a rather low overall electron - phonon coupling ( @xmath28 ) which can not explain the superconductivity@xcite while lanipo was shown to be be readily explained as conventional electron - phonon superconductor.@xcite for bani@xmath0as@xmath0 , we obtain a value of the electron - phonon coupling @xmath29 with logarithmically average frequency @xmath30 cm@xmath25 . inserting these numbers into the simplified allen - dynes formula , @xmath31 with @xmath32",
    ", we obtain @xmath33 4k , which overestimates but is reasonably in accord with the experimental low value of @xmath34 0.7k.@xcite as mentioned , the total dos per formula unit at the fermi energy is @xmath2 = 3.57 ev@xmath25 . with a typical @xmath35 stoner parameter @xmath36 0.7  0.8 ev ,",
    "this yields a stoner enhancement @xmath37 3 ( note that in this formula @xmath38 is per atom per spin ) .",
    "this enhancement is sufficient to indicate the presence of spin fluctuations that would depress the electron - phonon @xmath3 and may therefore explain why the experimental @xmath3 is reduced compared with the calculated value based on @xmath39 .",
    "in summary , we have presented electronic structure calculations that show bani@xmath0as@xmath0 has very different electronic properties compared to the fe based high @xmath3 superconductors .",
    "even though it has a band structure similar to that of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , the fermi level lies in the upper manifold away from the pseudogap due to higher number of valence electrons in ni@xmath8 .",

    "we obtain a moderately high @xmath2= 3.57 ev@xmath25 , which would yield a stoner renormalization of @xmath26 3 , consistent with spin fluctuations that would reduce the electron - phonon @xmath3 . nonetheless , the calculated value for electron - phonon coupling constant is @xmath9 , which is ample for a description of bani@xmath0as@xmath0 as an electron - phonon superconductor similar to lanipo .",
