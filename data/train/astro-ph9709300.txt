    "the detection of delayed emission in x - ray optical and radio wave length , `` afterglow '' , following a @xmath0-ray burst is reasonably described by the emission of a relativistic shell decelerating upon a collision with the ism ( waxman 1997a , b , wijers rees and mszros 1997 , katz and piran 1997 ) .",
    "the radio observations show substantial oscillations of order unity over the first few weeks ( frail et .",
    "1997 ) , while the optical measurements at the same time follow a smooth regular decline .",
    "it is therefor likely that the nature of these oscillations is not intrinsic to the source .",
    "these oscillations might be explained by scintillation in our galaxy .",
    "goodman s estimates ( 1997 ) show that the size of the observed emitter is in the limit between being a large object , subject only to refractive scintillation , and being a small one , subject to diffractive scintillation that can account for fluctuations of order unity . in order to correctly account for this scintillation",
    "a good estimate for the size of the observed object is needed .",
    "in addition , the size of the object is relevant for estimates of the observed luminosity if the emission is self absorbed ( katz & piran 1997 ) . the size is also important in concern with microlensing ( loeb & perna 1997 ) . in section 2",
    "we show that the observed radiation has well defined boundaries and derive an explicit expression for its size . in section 3",
    "we discuss the brightness distribution within this limited size .",
    "we find the flux averaged radius and lorentz factor of the material emitting the radiation . we show that this effective emission radius for observed frequencies above the peak frequency is smaller than for observed frequencies below the peak frequency .",
    "we consider first the well know result ( rees 1966 ) of the observed size of a thin shell with constant velocity @xmath2 .",
    "this relation is simple to derive and it gives the basic picture .",
    "it is also appropriate for non relativistic velocities . after a time @xmath3",
    "the shell is located at radius @xmath4 .",
    "a photon that is emitted at an angle @xmath5 from the line of sight ( connecting the observer and the source ) will reach the observer at time @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "this expression describes the locus of points from which the radiation reaches the observer at the same time ( see upper frame of figure 1 ) .",
    "it is an ellipse whose long axis is along the line of sight .",
    "the source is located at the far focal point .",
    "the observed size of the emitting area is the small axis of the ellipse @xmath8 .    in the afterglow scenario a shell accumulates ism mass and decelerates with @xmath9 . due to the accumulation of mass ,",
    "the lorentz factor of the shock front is higher than the lorentz factor of the material behind it @xmath0 by a factor of @xmath10 . as we have recently pointed out ( sari 1997 ) , the relation between the observed time of arrival of photon from the line of sight and the radius at which it was emitted is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the lorentz factor of the material immediately behind the shock .",
    "the subscript @xmath13 indicates that this relation is valid only for photons arriving from the line of sight .",
    "an equivalent expression relating @xmath14 and the time of emittance @xmath3 is @xmath15 the arrival time @xmath16 of a photon emitted at an angle @xmath5 is given by @xmath17 solving equation [ roft ] and [ toft ] we have @xmath18 substituting @xmath0=@xmath19 , the above equation yields @xmath20.\\ ] ] equation [ muofr ] is the decelerating analogy of the ellipse given in equation [ ellipse ] for a constant velocity shell .",
    "it describes an elongated `` egg - shape '' shown in the lower frame of figure 1 .",
    "the relevant size in the context of scintillation or microlensing would be the distance from the line of sight @xmath21 : @xmath22 the maximal value of the expression is obtained at @xmath23 where @xmath24 this should be compared with the constant velocity shell @xmath25 . a substitution of the expression for @xmath12 ( sari 1997 ) obtained by using the self similar solution of blandford & mckee ( 1976 ) yields : @xmath26 this result is quite robust as it depend very weakly on the energy in the system @xmath27 erg and the ism particle density @xmath28 .",
    "the only assumptions used are adiabatic evolution described by the blandford and mckee self similar solution , and the assumption of high lorentz factor .",
    "equation [ rperpmax ] gives the maximal @xmath21 from which radiation will reach the observer at a given observer time .",
    "the distribution of the surface brightness within this radius requires additional assumptions concerning the emitted spectrum .",
    "consider a system with an isotropic luminosity @xmath29 , at some frequency @xmath30 ( both in the fluid comoving frame ) , that is moving with lorentz factor @xmath0 in a direction @xmath7 with width @xmath31 relative to the line of sight .",
    "each photon of frequency @xmath30 will be lorentz boosted to frequency @xmath32 .",
    "using lorentz transformation , the observed flux at distance @xmath33 from the source satisfies : @xmath34    a spherical system , with a luminosity @xmath35 in its local frame , is simply a collection of such directed systems .",
    "the luminosity coming from an angle with @xmath31 around @xmath36 is @xmath37 so that @xmath38 since we are interested in the radiation coming from any @xmath21 per unit area ( surface brightness ) this expression must be multiplied by @xmath39 where we can use equations [ muofr ] and [ rpofmu ] to evaluate the derivatives . using equation [ muofr ] and assuming @xmath40",
    ", we can approximate @xmath41\\ ] ] so that @xmath42 } { \\left[1 - 5\\left(\\frac r { r_l } \\right)^4 \\right ] \\left[1 + 7\\left(\\frac r { r_l } \\right)^4 \\right]^3}\\ ] ]    we now assume that the luminosity in the local frame is changing with radius and frequency as @xmath43    with this assumption the surface brightness coming from a radius @xmath14 is proportional to @xmath44^{3-b } } \\frac { 1 + 3(r / r_l)^4 }         { 1 - 5(r / r_l)^4}.\\ ] ] this is also a function of @xmath21 using equation [ rpofmu ] .",
    "note that the function @xmath45 is double valued .",
    "for each @xmath21 there are two values of @xmath36 , one from the front of the expanding shell and one from its back . on the transition point ,",
    "where @xmath46 , we get the relativistic version of limb brightening , as the denominator of the second term in equation [ sbofr ] vanishes .",
    "the limbs in the relativistic version are not the edges of the surface in a given time as in the nonrelativistic case but the edges of surface from which photons arrive in a given observed time .",
    "the assumption of equation [ powerlawl ] is justified for frequencies which are far from the typical synchrotron frequency ( either above or below ) .",
    "fortunately these are two relevant cases as the radio range is below the typical frequency for few months while the optical bands are above the typical frequency after about 1 day . assuming that the electrons are not cooling significantly we find that the luminosity is proportional to the number of electrons @xmath47 times the power produced by each electron @xmath48 .",
    "this is emitted at a typical frequency of @xmath49 .",
    "the luminosity at the typical frequency is therefor @xmath50 the synchrotron low energy tail ( assuming that the electrons are neither cooling nor self absorbed ) is @xmath51 so that for @xmath52 @xmath53 at the high energy tail , assuming that the electron distribution is a power law with equal energy per decade we get @xmath54    figure 2 depicts the observed surface brightness for these two cases of low and high frequencies . in both cases the surface brightness diverges at @xmath55 . in the low frequency case",
    "the surfaces brightness in the center is about half the average surface brightness while in the high frequencies it is only about 10% .",
    "practically all the luminosity at high frequencies is emitted from a ring while at low frequencies it is spread more uniformly .",
    "this qualitative difference might be intuitively understood as for high frequencies the luminosity is decaying in time so that emission from a lower radius ( coming off the line of sight ) is enhanced relative to the emission from the line of sight .    as seen from figure 1",
    ", the radiation at a given observed time @xmath16 comes from a large range of radii @xmath14 .",
    "however , using equation [ sbofr ] one can calculate the flux averaged radius of emission @xmath56 or the flux averaged perpendicular emission radius @xmath57 .",
    "the lorentz factor @xmath58 at the average radius can then be calculated by @xmath59 .",
    "for low frequencies we find @xmath60 while for high frequencies @xmath61 therefor radiation arriving the observer at a certain time in a frequency band above the peak frequency , was emitted on average from lower radius , higher lorentz factor and outer @xmath21 , than radiation arriving to the observer at the same time in an energy band below the peak .",
    "one can now find the relation between the typical radius @xmath62 , the typical lorentz factor @xmath63 and the observed time @xmath16 . for low frequencies :",
    "@xmath64 while for high frequencies",
    "@xmath65 these replace the usual relation @xmath66 .",
    "the coefficient in the denominator depends on the frequency observed .",
    "its range is between @xmath67 ( for frequencies far below the peak frequency ) and @xmath68 ( for frequencies far above the peak frequency ) .",
    "therefor for the peak frequency itself we expect the coefficient to be some average of these two extreme values .",
    "we have explored the spatial shape of the radiation emitted from a decelerating relativistic shell in its adiabatic evolution @xmath69 . using the self similar solution which gives the exact proportionality constant we have arrived at an explicit expression for the observed size of the emission as a function of time .",
    "we have further analyzed the observed surface brightness in two extreme cases of frequencies far below and far above the typical synchrotron frequency .",
    "these two extremes are of practical importance as the radio is below the typical synchrotron frequency for few month and the optical is above the typical synchrotron frequency after about a day .",
    "we showed that this emission has sharp well defined edges .",
    "the edges are brighter than the center as a result of a relativistic version of the limb brightening effect .",
    "the surface brightness for frequencies below the synchrotron typical frequency was shown to be more uniform than in the high frequency range in which most of the radiation comes from a small region near the limbs .",
    "the exact shape is relevant for a detailed scintillation theory .",
    "furthermore , in the case of a `` nearby '' burst with @xmath70 it is likely that the radio source will be resolved , and a direct observation of the surface brightness will be possible .",
    "the relation between the emission radius , the lorentz factor and the observed time is not well defined as there is a large range of radii from which the emission reaches the observer at the same time .",
    "however taking the flux averaged radius of emission and the lorentz factor at the average radius we find @xmath71 where @xmath72 for the high frequency limit and @xmath73 in the low frequency limit .",
    "these values of @xmath74 are smaller than the coefficient @xmath75 obtained from the line of sight ( sari 1997 ) however larger than the usual value of @xmath76 .",
    "the effective lorenz factor for high frequencies is larger by @xmath77 than the effective lorentz factor for low frequencies .",
    "the transition to the non relativistic stage and the effect of finite size jet ( rhoads 1997 ) both depend on the lorentz factor . since the observed time @xmath78",
    ", these effects would be observable in the radio at about a factor of two earlier than they would be observed in the optical range .",
