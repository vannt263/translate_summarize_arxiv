    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are known to have strong emission lines of various ion species . among them , the emission lines are one of the most prominent features in the ultraviolet ( uv ) to optical spectrum of many agns .",
    "they have long been hoped to provide significant information about some aspects of the agns and their host environments , e.g. , energy budget of the line emission region and the epoch of the first star formation in the host galaxies .",
    "the determination of the first star formation epoch is based on the standard theory that the iron enrichment in galaxies is delayed compared to that of the @xmath3-elements , such as magnesium , due to their different origins ; type ia supernovae for iron and type ii supernovae for the @xmath3-elements @xcite .",
    "the delay corresponds to the difference in life - times of the progenitors of the two types of supernovae , and is estimated to be 0.3  1 gyr depending on the host galaxy environments @xcite .",
    "many observations have been devoted to the measurement of / line flux ratios in high - redshift quasars for this purpose over the last decade ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , the observed / ratios show a large scatter , preventing a detection of any significant trend in the fe abundance as a function of redshift . while a part of the scatter might be due to the difference in the intrinsic fe / mg abundance ratio , it is presumable that the diversity of the physical condition within the line - forming gas , affecting line emissivities , is the main cause @xcite . in the same sense",
    ", a change of the observed / ratio as a function of redshift , if found , should be carefully examined to tell whether it reflects the abundance evolution or the systematic variation of the line emissivity .",
    "thus establishment of a method to probe the line - emitting gas and estimate its physical parameters such as density and incident - ionizing radiation flux has been much awaited .    unfortunately , the fe@xmath4 atom is characterized by an enormous numbers of possible electronic transitions , yielding the `` pseudocontinuum '' often observed in agn spectra , which makes analysis of the observations extremely difficult from both the observational and theoretical viewpoints ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter t06 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a promising approach is to use the emission lines emitted by simple atoms in the same region as the lines .",
    "the most potent lines are and , whose co - spatial emergence with is indicated by a resemblance of their profiles @xcite and by a correlation between the line strengths @xcite .",
    "note that it is a natural consequence of similar ionization potentials of the relevant ions , i.e. , 16.2 ev for , 13.6 ev for , and 11.9 ev for .",
    "the first extensive study of the physical properties of emitting gases in agns was presented by @xcite , who observed the strongest line , @xmath08446 , as well as other weaker lines in seyfert 1 ( sy1 ) galaxies .",
    "he found that @xmath08446 lacks the narrow component that characterizes other permitted lines , and concluded that the line is purely a belr phenomenon .",
    "he also suggested that @xmath08446 is produced by ly@xmath5 fluorescence , which was later confirmed by the observation of i zw 1 , the prototype narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) , by @xcite .",
    "@xcite compiled the uv and near - ir lines , namely , @xmath01304 , @xmath08446 , and @xmath011287 , in normal sy1s and nls1s in order to investigate their flux ratios .",
    "they found that there must be an additional excitation mechanism for @xmath08446besides ly@xmath5 fluorescence  which they concluded is collisional excitation .",
    "as for the lines , extensive studies of sy1s were presented by @xcite and @xcite . we have observed seven quasars at redshifts up to @xmath61.0 for the purpose of obtaining the uv and near - ir and lines , thus extending the previous studies to include quasars at high redshifts .",
    "photoionization model calculations were performed and compared with the observations , which led us to conclude that the and lines are formed in a gas with density @xmath7 @xmath8 , illuminated by the ionizing radiation corresponding to the ionization parameter of @xmath9 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* the latter is referred to as paper i hereafter ) .",
    "now that the general properties of the and emitting gas , as a whole , are thus being revealed , we should turn our eyes to the following question : how are these gas properties related to the quasar characteristics , such as redshift and luminosity ? here we present results of a compilation of the emission - line fluxes of @xmath08446 , @xmath011287 , and the near - ir triplet ( @xmath08498 , @xmath08542 , and @xmath08662 ) observed in 11 quasars .",
    "the quasars are distributed over wide ranges of redshift ( 0.06 @xmath1 1.08 ) and of luminosity ( @xmath10 ) , thus providing a useful sample to track the line - emitting gas properties in various quasar environments .",
    "the observational and theoretical data used in this work are described in  [ sec : data ] , and results and discussion appear in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "a quasar sample is compiled from @xcite , @xcite , and paper i. their observational characteristics - band absolute magnitudes of the quasars are taken from @xcite who assumed the cosmological parameters of @xmath11 = 50 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 and @xmath13 = 0 . in a flat cosmology with @xmath11 = 71 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 , @xmath14 = 0.29 , and @xmath15 = 0.71 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the absolute magnitudes would be systematically smaller than listed in table [ sample ] by 0.6  0.7 mag ( see fig . 2 in * ? ? ?",
    ". however , such a systematic change does not affect our arguments below .",

    "the sample in @xcite mainly provides quasars in the local universe ( @xmath16 0.1 ) ; they selected the quasars from the palomer bright quasar survey of @xcite with the criteria of ( 1 ) being well - known studied sources in the optical / uv and x - ray regions , and ( 2 ) having the @xmath17-band magnitude limited to @xmath18 12 . on the other hand ,",
    "the quasars in @xcite and paper i constitute a high - redshift sample with redshifts up to @xmath61.0 .",
    "the selection criteria used in those works are that ( 1 ) the uv spectrum is available in the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "faint object spectrograph archive @xcite ; and ( 2 ) @xmath08446 , @xmath011287 , and the near - ir triplet fall within the atmospheric windows .",
    "then the brightest objects in the target list were observed , which have the @xmath19-band magnitudes of @xmath20 15 .",
    "although the fluxes of the relevant and lines have been measured in @xcite , we re - measured them with the identical method to paper i in order to remove any systematic differences due to the different measurement strategies , especially for deblending the @xmath08446 + the triplet feature .",
    "the 1@xmath21 error of the spectra is assumed to be 1% of the continuum level while their spectra apparently have the higher qualities .",
    "the measured fluxes of @xmath011287 is plotted versus those listed in @xcite in figure [ compare ] ; they are in good agreement with each other , which is well within the accuracy needed in this work .",
    "we also re - measured the emission - line fluxes of pg 1116@xmath22215 studied in @xcite , since we did not cover the lines in that work .",
    "the measured line strengths are listed in table [ lineflux ] as the photon number flux ratios of the triplet/ @xmath08446 and of @xmath011287/ @xmath08446 , and as the rest - frame equivalent widths ( ews ) of @xmath08446 .",
    "these forms of expression are particularly useful in discussing the line formation processes .",
    "hereafter they are expressed as @xmath23()/@xmath23 ( @xmath08446 ) , @xmath23(@xmath011287)/@xmath23(@xmath08446 ) , and ew ( @xmath08446 ) , respectively .      in order to interpret the observations , we utilize the model calculations presented in paper i. they are briefly summarized below .",
    "the model calculations were performed in the framework of the photoionized belr gas using the photoionization code cloudy , version 06.02 @xcite .",
    "two shapes of the incident continuum were adopted , which are `` standard agn ionizing continuum ' 's reported in t06 and in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter k97 ) . however , we found little effect on the predicted and line ratios by changing the incident continuum shape from one to another",
    ". the belr gas was modeled to have a constant hydrogen density @xmath24 ( @xmath8 ) and be exposed to the ionizing continuum with a photon flux of @xmath25 ( s@xmath12 @xmath26 ) . in the calculations , the ionizing continuum flux was expressed with the ionization parameter @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the speed of light .",
    "the gas column density was set to 10@xmath29 @xmath26 and was changed in a range of @xmath30 @xmath26 , while the chemical abundance was assumed to be solar .",
    "three cases of the microturbulence were considered , whose velocity @xmath31 is 0 , 10 , and 100 km s@xmath12 .    the different continuum shapes and the microturbulent velocities were combined into four baseline models ( model 1 with t06 continuum and @xmath31 = 0 km s@xmath12 , model 2 with t06 continuum and @xmath31 = 10 km s@xmath12 , model 3 with t06 continuum and @xmath31 = 100 km s@xmath12 , and model 4 with k97 continuum and @xmath31 = 100 km s@xmath12 ) .",
    "we searched in the gas physical parameter space of ( @xmath24 , @xmath32 ) in each model for the parameter sets that reproduce the observed and line strengths , and found that all baseline models with ( @xmath24 , @xmath32 ) around ( @xmath33 @xmath8 , @xmath34 ) best fit to the observations . on the other hand , the observed shape and ew of the uv emission",
    "could not be reproduced unless the microturbulent velocity of @xmath35 100 km s@xmath12 was assumed @xcite .",
    "thus we adopt model 3 as the default baseline model below , while we get little change of the results in this work concerning the analysis of the and lines when other baseline models are adopted .",
    "the ( @xmath24 , @xmath32 ) parameters that best fit to the observations in model 3 are ( @xmath24 , @xmath32 ) = ( 10@xmath36 @xmath8 , 10@xmath37 ) , which are used as the reference grid point below .",
    "we plot the observed values of @xmath23()/@xmath23 ( @xmath08446 ) , @xmath23(@xmath011287)/@xmath23(@xmath08446 ) , and ew ( @xmath08446 ) as functions of the redshift and of the @xmath38-band absolute magnitude @xmath39 in figure [ vsprop2 ] .",
    "one of the remarkable results is found in the top panels ; the / @xmath08446 ratio is hardly dependent on redshift or luminosity over the plotted range , while the ratio is predicted to be very sensitive to the density of the line - emitting gas in the photoionization models .",
    "we show the model predictions on the @xmath23()/@xmath23 ( @xmath08446 ) ",
    "@xmath23(@xmath011287)/@xmath23(@xmath08446 ) plane in figure [ oioi ] ( _ left _ ) , as well as the observed values ( see also fig . 7 in paper i = 0 km s@xmath12 , could not reproduce the observed uv emissions ( see  [ data_model ] ) .",
    "however , model 3 adopted in this work predict very similar results to those shown in figure 7 regarding the and emissions , while the whole pattern of contour is slightly ( @xmath6 0.5 dex ) shifted to the high - density regime ; the best - fit parameters in model 1 are ( @xmath24 , @xmath32 ) = ( 10@xmath40 @xmath8 , 10@xmath41 ) . ] ) .",
    "the gas density @xmath24 and the ionization parameter @xmath32 are changed around the reference grid point , ( @xmath24 , @xmath32 ) = ( 10@xmath36 @xmath8 , 10@xmath37 ) , over 2 orders of magnitude in both parameters .",
    "it is clearly seen that the predicted @xmath23()/@xmath23 ( @xmath08446 ) ratio increases monotonically with the increased gas density , and that all the observed values are marked with the density in the vicinity of the reference point , log @xmath24 = 12.0 .",
    "thus the similar density of the line - emitting gases are strongly indicated for the quasars distributed over these redshift and luminosity ranges .",
    "the values of ew ( @xmath08446 ) , both observed and calculated with the density of log @xmath24 = 12.0 , are shown in figure [ oioi ] ( _ right _ ) as a function of the @xmath23(@xmath011287)/ @xmath23(@xmath08446 ) ratio .",
    "it shows that the predictions of ews are also consistent with the observed data when log @xmath24 = 12.0 and a covering fraction ( cf ) of the line - emitting gas as seen from the central energy source of 0.2  0.5 are assumed .",
    "note that the covering fraction could be much smaller if we assumed oxygen overabundance relative to the solar value .",
    "on the other hand , a scatter of the observed data in the @xmath23(@xmath011287)/ @xmath23(@xmath08446 ) axis seems to be related to the diversity of the ionization parameter ( fig .",
    "[ oioi ] , _ left _ ) .",
    "note that the diversity of other parameters , such as microturbulent velocity , gas column density , and chemical composition , could not explain this diagram since they significantly alter the @xmath23()/@xmath23 ( @xmath08446 ) ratio , rather than @xmath23(@xmath011287)/ @xmath23(@xmath08446 ) , and thus they are unable to explain the observed similarity of the former ratios ( paper i ) .",
    "it is also quite unlikely that the diversity of these parameter values is balanced out by the fine - tuned density in such a way that the @xmath23()/@xmath23 ( @xmath08446 ) ratio is always kept to be @xmath61.0 , unless these lines are the dominant heating or cooling sources of the emission region . as with the @xmath23()/@xmath23 ( @xmath08446 ) ratio , @xmath23(@xmath011287)/ @xmath23(@xmath08446 )",
    "is not clearly dependent on the redshift or luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ vsprop2 ] , _ middle left and middle right _ ) .",
    "the above arguments invoke a picture of the line - emitting gases in quasars that have similar densities and are located at regions exposed to various ionizing radiation fluxes .",
    "it would be a consequence of the difference in distance to the central continuum source and/or in the intrinsic luminosity of the quasars .",
    "note that it is in clear contrast to the well - studied case of h@xmath5 , whose emission regions in agns are known to be characterized by similar ionization parameters .",
    "in fact , reverberation mapping results for h@xmath5 show the emission region size ( @xmath42 )  luminosity ( @xmath43 ) relation of @xmath44 , which is consistent with the constant ionization parameter regime @xcite .",
    "such a situation has long been expected in order to account for the remarkably similar agn spectra over a broad range of luminosity , and was incorporated into the locally optimally emitting cloud ( loc ) model suggested by @xcite , that is , that the belr is composed of gas with widely distributed physical parameters and each emission line arises from its preferable environment . on the other hand , the case in and lines apparently indicates that the location of the emission region is not radiation - selected .    in line with the above arguments",
    ", we found a clear difference of the velocity - luminosity relation between and h@xmath5 ; the measured line widths are plotted versus @xmath45 in figure [ mag_width ] , which shows that the line widths are remarkably similar , concentrated around 1500  2000 km s@xmath12 , over more than 3 orders of magnitude in the @xmath38-band luminosity . on the other hand ,",
    "those for the hydrogen balmer lines usually have a large scatter as shown by , e.g. , @xcite ; their sample of 34 agns , spanning over 4 orders of magnitude in continuum luminosity , has the line widths of 1000  10,000 km s@xmath12 .",
    "such a trend is also indicated by @xcite , who reported that while the correlation between fwhm ( ) and fwhm ( h@xmath5 ) is good for the small fwhm regime , the lines grow systematically narrower than h@xmath5 at large line width .",
    "@xcite conducted a detailed study of the near - ir emission line profiles in nls1s , and found that , , and lines are systematically narrower than the broad components of other low - ionization lines such as hydrogen paschen lines and @xmath010830",
    ". they also argued that these lines are produced in the outermost portion of the belr , since their widths are just slightly broader than those of [ ] @xmath09531 which they assumed is formed in the inner portion of the narrow emission line region ( nelr ) . while the scattered widths of lines could be interpreted as a consequence of the radiation - selected locations of the emitting gases , regardless of the gas kinematics , the remarkable similarity of the line widths might imply the kinematically determined emission regions .",
    "in such a situation , the diversity of the ionization parameters , as discussed above , would be an inevitable result . as stated by @xcite , there is clearly interesting information which could be deduced from studies of the and line profiles ; especially , reverberation mapping of these and lines would be a powerful tool to reveal the underlying physics .",
    "the widely - accepted theory of the belr describes its outer edge , where the and emission lines are likely to be formed , set by the dust sublimation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if we accept this picture , the dust grains are possibly mixed in the line - emitting gas and suppress the emission through the substantial ca depletion .",
    "such a situation is in fact reported for the nelr by the absence or significant weakness of the observed [ ] @xmath07291 line @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented the loc model calculations of the narrow emission lines and argued that ca is depleted relative to the solar value by factors of 3  160 .",
    "it is hard to see an evidence of the dust presence in the emission region from our results , since figure [ oioi ] appears to show that our dust - free models successfully reproduce the observations .",
    "however , it is noteworthy that it is quite difficult to account for the observed data at @xmath23(@xmath0 11287)/@xmath23(@xmath0 8446 ) @xmath46 0.4 by the models with log @xmath24 = 12.0 .",
    "the problem is that such small values of @xmath23(@xmath0 11287)/@xmath23(@xmath0 8446 ) could only be reproduced with the higher densities than log @xmath24 = 12.0 so that @xmath08446 emission is exclusively enhanced by the collisional excitation , while such a dense gas produces intense emission that is much stronger than observed .",
    "one can clearly see this trend in figure [ oioi ] ( _ left _ ) .",
    "if we assumed significant ca depletion in the line - emitting gas , these difficulties are naturally resolved since it significantly suppresses the otherwise intense emissions .",
    "for example , the data point representing ( log @xmath24 , log @xmath32 ) = ( 13.0 , @xmath472.5 ) in figure [ oioi ] ( _ left _ ) could provide a plausible model for the observations at @xmath23(@xmath0 11287)/@xmath23(@xmath0 8446 ) @xmath46 0.4 if the emission is suppressed by a factor of a few times 10 .",
    ", log @xmath32 ) = ( 13.0 , @xmath472.5 ) is ew ( @xmath08446 ) = 30  , which is consistent with the observations if rather large covering factors of 0.5  1.0 and/or oxygen overabundance relative to the solar value are assumed . ]",
    "the dust grains present in the line - emitting gas might also give the natural explanation to the observed lack of some uv emission lines relative to their optical or near - ir counterparts .",
    "@xcite mentioned the possibility of the dust survival in the belr gas in order to explain the extreme weakness of the observed @xmath03934 and @xmath03639 lines relative to the near - ir triplet .",
    "at least a part of the long - standing uv / opt problem , in which the observed ratios of uv flux to the optical flux fall far below the photoionization model predictions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , could also be explained .",
    "however , it should be noted that the dust would affect the line formation processes in a very complicated manner , which should be precisely addressed when discussing the specific lines ; for the and lines , one of the most apparent effects as well as the ca depletion would be the destruction of ly@xmath5 photons which otherwise excite atoms , thus the suppression of the emissions .",
    "the resultant line flux ratios could be much different from those derived from the simple speculations .",
    "we have compiled the emission - line fluxes of @xmath08446 , @xmath011287 , and the near - ir triplet ( @xmath08579 ) observed in 11 quasars .",
    "the quasars are distributed over wide ranges of redshift ( 0.06 @xmath1 1.08 ) and of luminosity ( @xmath48 ) , thus providing a useful sample to track the line - emitting gas properties in various quasar environments .",
    "the measured line strengths and velocities , as functions of the quasar properties , were analyzed with photoionization model calculations . our findings and conclusions are as follows :    \\1 .",
    "there is no sign of a significant change in the flux ratios of the triplet and @xmath08446 over the redshift and luminosity ranges studied here .",
    "it strongly indicates similar gas densities in the line - emission region from quasar to quasar .",
    "the observed scatter of the @xmath011287/@xmath08446 ratios appears to be related to the diversity of the ionization parameter , while the ratio is not clearly dependent on the redshift or luminosity .",
    "combined with the similarity of the / @xmath08446 ratios , it invokes the picture of the line - emitting gases in quasars that have similar densities and are located at regions exposed to various ionizing radiation fluxes .",
    "the line widths are remarkably similar from quasar to quasar over more than 3 orders of magnitude in luminosity .",
    "it might imply a kinematically determined location of the line emission region and is in clear contrast to the case of lines , whose emission region is considered to be radiation - selected .",
    "\\4 . if we accept that the and emission lines are formed at the outer edge of the belr and that the outer edge is set by the dust sublimation , the line - emitting gas is possibly mixed with the dust grains .",
    "in fact such a situation may better reproduce the observations than the dust - free case through the significant ca depletion .",

    "<S> these lines are considered to emerge from the same gas as do the lines in the low - ionized portion of the broad emission line region ( belr ) . </S>",
    "<S> the compiled quasars are distributed over wide ranges of redshift ( 0.06 @xmath1 1.08 ) and of luminosity ( @xmath2 ) , thus providing a useful sample to investigate the line - emitting gas properties in various quasar environments . </S>",
    "<S> the measured line strengths and velocities , as functions of the quasar properties , are analyzed using photoionization model calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the flux ratio between the triplet and @xmath08446 is hardly dependent on the redshift or luminosity , indicating similar gas densities in the emission region from quasar to quasar . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , a scatter of the @xmath011287/@xmath08446 ratios appears to imply the diversity of the ionization parameter . </S>",
    "<S> these facts invoke a picture of the line - emitting gases in quasars that have similar densities and are located at regions exposed to various ionizing radiation fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> the observed line widths are found to be remarkably similar over more than 3 orders of magnitude in luminosity , which indicates a kinematically determined location of the emission region and is in clear contrast to the case of lines . </S>",
    "<S> we also argue about the dust presence in the emission region since the region is suggested to be located near the dust sublimation point at the outer edge of the belr . </S>"
