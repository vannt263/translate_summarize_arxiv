    "the atlas collaboration has recently reported an intriguing excess in hadronically decaying diboson ( @xmath2 ) resonant production peaked around @xmath3 tev  @xcite . the observed excess corresponds to significances of 3.4 @xmath4 , 2.6 @xmath4 and 2.9 @xmath4 for the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 channels respectively .",
    "hadronically decaying @xmath8 and @xmath9 are not easy to distinguish so the three channels are not exclusive . as a cuantitative example , for a @xmath10 with a 2 tev mass decaying to @xmath5 , we have the following @xmath11 c.l . expected ( exp ) and observed ( obs ) limits @xmath12",
    "although the excess is not statistical significant yet , it is interesting to entertain the possibility that it corresponds to a real signal of new physics .",
    "there is a similar search for hadronically decaying diboson production in cms  @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough there is a small excess localized near the @xmath13 tev region . for a @xmath10 with a 2 tev mass decaying to @xmath5 cms finds @xmath14 an interpretation of these excesses in a number of models has been recently presented in  @xcite . in this article we will show that they can be explained in the context of non - custodial composite higgs models without conflicting with any other current experimental bound .",
    "a natural prediction of composite higgs models is the presence of composite vector resonances that mix with the standard model ( sm ) electroweak bosons .",
    "they typically have a large coupling to the longitudinal components of the @xmath9 and @xmath8 bosons and therefore their decay into pairs of sm gauge bosons is usually sizeable .",
    "thus , they are prime candidates to explain an excess in diboson resonant production .",
    "the mass scale of the diboson excess @xmath15 tev is however smaller than the typical masses of the vector resonances in composite higgs models , which , due to a sizeable tree - level contribution to the @xmath16 parameter , are expected to be in the @xmath17 tev region  @xcite .",
    "however , using a soft - wall construction of higher - dimensional holographic duals of composite higgs models it has been shown that lighter vector resonances are compatible with electroweak precision tests ( ewpt ) both in custodial  @xcite and non - custodial  @xcite set - ups . in practice this is done by reducing the mixing between the heavy vector resonances and the sm gauge bosons and the coupling between the former and the sm fermions .",
    "reducing these mixings and couplings allows for lighter resonances compatible with ewpt but it also reduces their production cross section and their decay branching ratio into sm vector bosons , making their collider phenomenology more challenging  @xcite . hence there is , in principle , a tension in these models between the constraints from ewpt and the possible size of anomalous diboson production . for the sake of simplicity we will consider in this article the minimal non - custodial composite higgs model as a benchmark and study in detail the compatibility of the observed excess with constraints from ewpt .     before explaining the excesses in the context of specific models , however",
    ", one should check whether these excesses are compatible with the results of other diboson resonant searches or if , on the contrary , they are already excluded by the latter .",
    "we will show in the next section that , although there is a large number of related searches for diboson resonance production with no significant excess , the corresponding bounds are compatible with the number of events needed to explain the observed excess .",
    "of course with a specific model in mind there are also other experimental searches that play a relevant role in constraining the parameters of the model .",
    "in particular the most important ones for non - custodial composite higgs models are dijet , dilepton and top pair production .",
    "we will show that there are regions of parameter space in which the observed excess can be explained without contradicting any of the existing limits .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ experimental : sec ] we will summarize the different experimental searches for exotic resonances . in sec .",
    "[ model ] the non - custodial model will be presented including the ew fit .",
    "the results are presented in sec .",
    "[ results ] and finally sec .",
    "[ conclu ] is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "as mentioned above , before trying to explain the observed excess in terms of a specific model , we have to make sure that the excess is not already ruled out by other related resonant searches .",
    "there are a number of other diboson ( ww / wz / zz ) resonant searches performed by atlas and cms in the semi - leptonic and purely leptonic channels .",
    "no significant excesses are observed in these searches and the resulting @xmath11 c.l .",
    "bounds are reported in the first block of table  [ bounds ] .",
    ".summary of the relevant @xmath11 c.l . observed bounds .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,>,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have performed detailed scans over the parameter space of the model , computing the constraints from ewpt and the corresponding production cross sections in all the relevant channels discussed in the previous sections .",
    "these cross sections have been computed with ` mg5 `  @xcite , using a model created with feynrules  @xcite .",
    "our results are summarized in fig .  [",
    "results : fig ] in which we show the region in the @xmath18 that successfully reproduces the atlas excess , together with the most relevant constraints .",
    "the colored areas correspond to the regions that are forbidden by current constraints . in the case of the @xmath19 signal , this means that either the sum of the cross section in both channels is smaller than @xmath20 fb ( upper red region ) or that the bound in eq .",
    "( [ diboson : upper : bound ] ) is not satisfied ( lower red region ) .",
    "all the other bounds are color coded as the label indicates .",
    "the white area corresponds to the allowed region that generates the observed signal excess .",
    "the input parameters in the figure have been fixed to @xmath21 tev and @xmath22 , @xmath23 tev and @xmath24 and @xmath25 tev and @xmath26 in the top , middle and bottom rows , respectively .",
    "the left ( right ) column corresponds to @xmath27 ( 0.5 ) and in all six plots we have fixed @xmath28 .",
    "these plots show that there is a very narrow range in @xmath29 that is compatible with ewpt and dilepton bounds .",
    "having enough signal requires sizeable @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "bounds from @xmath32 production constrain the value of @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( the latter is also constrained by ewpt ) to be relatively low . finally , when the coupling to the third generation quarks are small enough , the upper bound on diboson production in eq .",
    "( [ diboson : upper : bound ] ) and dijet production become the most stringent constraints that prevent the strength of @xmath31 to be too large . combining all these constraints we find the following region in the parameter space for our non - custodial composite higgs model that can explain the observed diboson excess without contradicting any other experimental bound @xmath35 where , depending on the exact values of the parameters ( including @xmath36 ) slightly smaller or larger ranges can be allowed .    before going to our conclusions",
    "let us mention that there are some small excesses in other analyses , like @xmath37 or dijets which could also be explained , at least partially , in the same region of parameter space needed to explain the resonant diboson excess .",
    "we have not tried to fit any of them but it is worth keeping an eye on any forthcoming analysis .",
    "any complete uv model will have different correlated predictions in different channels that hopefully the run 2 of the lhc will be able to confirm .",
    "in this paper we have tried to give an explanation to the recently reported excess in diboson resonant production in the context of non - custodial composite models .",
    "composite higgs models naturally predict the existence of spin-1 resonances , among other ones , which could explain the observed excess . we have shown",
    "that in a particular class of model based on a soft - wall construction one can satisfy all bounds from ewpt and direct searches and still be able to reproduce the resulting observed excess .",
    "the mass range reported for the excess , @xmath15 tev , is however somewhat low to be accommodated in standard warped models , due to the strong bound coming from the @xmath16-parameter .",
    "this is the reason to resort to soft - wall models , in which the mixing of these resonances with the sm gauge bosons is reduced in such a way that @xmath3 tev vector resonances are compatible with bounds from ewpt . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we have considered a minimal non - custodial composite higgs model .",
    "however we have prefered to remain agnostic regarding the underlying gravitational model and we have therefore parameterized with complete generality the relevant couplings . despite the tension present in the model between the production of a sizeable diboson cross section and direct and indirect constraints we have found that there are regions of parameter space in which the excess can be completely explained without contradicting any other experimental bound . the global analysis , including all the constraints , that we have performed selects a well - defined region of parameter space in non - custodial composite higgs models in which lepton - quark universality have to be abandoned ( due to the bounds from @xmath38 searches ) .",
    "we also need a sizeable coupling to the light quarks and a reduced coupling to third generation quarks .",
    "this would generically correspond to a holographic soft - wall model with a modest volume factor , essentially conformal leptons and with a not - fully composite top quark .",
    "the tension between the signal and experimental bounds also means that , if the excess is confirmed during the lhc run 2 , it is likely that other related excesses appear with a similar mass scale .",
    "in particular , @xmath32 , dijet , @xmath38 or diboson resonances in other channels ( most notably in the semi - leptonic ones ) are expected to be easily visible with the new data .",
    "a detailed measurement of the corresponding signals would help disentangle the precise region of parameter space that explains all the excesses .",
    "we would like to thank jorge de blas and gustaaf brooijmans for useful discussions and the cole de physique des houches for creating an ideal atmosphere where this project was started .",
