    "frhlich mechanism of electron - phonon coupling is of key importance for carrier energy relaxation in bulk polar semiconductors as well as in heterostructures formed by different polar materials  .",
    "one of the examples of such heterostructures is provided by semiconductor quantum dots of polar material in a crystalline polar environment  .",
    "recently carrier dynamics in heterostructures combining both polar and non - polar constituents , such as si nanocrystals embedded into a silica glass matrix , has attracted much attention  .",
    "therefore , it becomes interesting to analyze if the polar environment can induce frhlich - like interaction within a non - polar inclusion .",
    "however , the electric field associated with a wave of the lo - type propagating in a polar crystal can not penetrate through the interface with a non - polar inclusion , since the dielectric permittivity , @xmath1 , vanishes at the frequency of the lo - phonon mode @xmath2 . on the other hand , it is well known that amorphous media possess high - frequency vibrational eigenmodes of strongly localized character  . in this work",
    "we will show that the local modes in a polar amorphous media can induce an alternating electric field even within a non - polar inclusion and thus provide an efficient channel for relaxation of electronic excitations of the inclusion .",
    "such a process can be responsible for electron relaxation in si nanocrystals in sio@xmath0 .",
    "we expect this relaxation channel to be predominant as conduction - band electron interaction with optical phonons via deformation potential is forbidden in silicon by the crystal symmetry  .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : electrostatics ] we describe a simplified model of a non - polar spherical quantum dot surrounded by a polar environment and derive equations for the time of carrier relaxation induced by local vibrations in the environment . in sec .",

    "let us consider a spherical semiconductor nanocrystal embedded into a polar glass matrix .",
    "we will characterize the @xmath5th local vibration mode in the glass by the oscillating dipole moment @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the charge and the displacement of the @xmath9-th ion participating in the @xmath5-th local vibration .",
    "the system under study is sketched in fig .  1 , where a random orientation of the dipoles is assumed .    according to electrostatic approximation ( see appendix )",
    "the potential inside the nanocrystal of the radius @xmath10 and dielectric constant @xmath11 induced by a point dipole source with polarization @xmath12 , positioned in the matrix with dielectric constant @xmath13 , can be represented as @xmath14^{j+2 } }   \\left [ \\bm p_0^{(j)}\\cdot\\bm y_{jm}^{j+1 } \\left ( { \\bm n}_0^{(j ) } \\right ) \\right]^*\\:,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the vector spherical harmonics introduced in ref .  .",
    "neglecting retardation , one can use the fermi golden rule to calculate the rate of intraband transitions of the electron confined within the spherical nanocrystal under the influence of the quasistatic electric field induced by the local vibrations . at low temperatures @xcite",
    "this rate is given by @xmath17 where summation runs over all the local modes of the matrix , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are , respectively , the energies of the initial @xmath20 and the final @xmath21 states of the confined electron .",
    "neglecting electron tunneling outside the sphere , one can write the transition matrix element as @xmath22^{j+2 } } { \\langle}\\psi_f|r^jy_{jm}|\\psi{\\rangle}\\left [ \\bm p_0^{(j)}\\cdot\\bm y_{jm}^{j+1 } \\left ( { \\bm n}_0^{(j ) } \\right ) \\right]^*\\ : . \\end{split}\\ ] ]    introducing the vibration distribution function as @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 ) summation over vibrational modes in eq .",

    "we need to estimate the mean value of the dipole moment corresponding to a given local vibrational mode .",
    "let us first introduce characteristic values , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , for the mean square displacement and atomic mass of the atoms participating in the vibration , respectively ( we neglect the fact that we deal with different sorts of atoms ) .",
    "this enables us to write @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the number of atoms participating in the vibration , @xmath33 . at low temperatures @xmath34 and ,",
    "therefore , @xmath35 the dipole moment characterizing this vibrational mode is related to @xmath29 through @xmath36 where the factor @xmath37 depends on the relative orientations of displacements for atoms participating in the local mode .    the other glass parameters entering eq .",
    "are the concentration of dipoles , @xmath38 , and vibrational density of states , @xmath39 .",
    "the concentration of dipoles is of the order of @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the characteristic atomic scale .",
    "the rough estimation for the density of states is @xmath42 .",
    "numerical simulations performed for silica glass   show that the actual phase volume of the high - frequency localized vibrations is at least by a factor of 5 less than the total phase volume .",
    "this factor decreases the density of states by about an order of magnitude .",
    "in this section we will perform a model calculation of the relaxation time due to the coupling of electron confined in a quantum dot with local vibrations of the quantum dot environment .",
    "the quantum dot is treated as a spherical quantum well with the infinite potential barrier .",
    "we consider an electron from a simple band with an isotropic effective mass @xmath43 and use the effective mass approximation . in this case",
    "the electron states are characterized by the radial quantum number @xmath44 , the orbital angular momentum @xmath45 , its projection @xmath46 onto an arbitrary axis , and a projection of the electron spin .",
    "neglecting for simplicity the electron spin , within the effective mass approximation one can characterize the electron states only by the envelope wave function @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the spherical bessel function , the numbers @xmath49 are found from @xmath50 and the energy levels @xmath51 are degenerate over @xmath46 .",
    "[ levels ] shows the dependence of first six energy levels on the nanocrystal diameter , @xmath52 , for @xmath53 nm , where the density of states mass in si , @xmath54 was used ( @xmath55 is the free electron mass ) .",
    "comparison of the energy level positions with those provided by more accurate calculations   suggests that the approximation of infinite barriers is reasonable for the dot under consideration .",
    "a transition between two of the levels of size quantization with the energies ( [ enrl ] ) is possible when their diameter - dependent difference falls within the spectral range , @xmath56 corresponding to high - frequency local vibrations of the silica glass . vertical arrows in fig .",
    "[ levels ] indicate these allowed regions and the corresponding transition time is shown near each arrow . the calculation is carried out for the set of qd parameters close to that of si / sio@xmath0 system : @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "our model is too simple to describe the spectral dependence of glass parameters .",
    "thus , we take them at a fixed value in the middle of the range ( [ conserve ] ) : @xmath59 mev . other parameters used",
    "are as follows : @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62  @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the vibrating mass , @xmath30 , was taken as @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the silicon and oxygen atomic masses , respectively .",
    "since the levels are degenerate over momentum projection @xmath46 , we have summed the relaxation rate over the final states and averaged over initial ones .",
    "[ levels ] demonstrates that typical value of the relaxation time is of the order of 1 ns . the transition rate is proportional to @xmath68 , so it changes with the nanocrystal diameter slower than the energy difference proportional to @xmath69 .",
    "relaxation time between the first six energy levels for different diameters of the nanocrystal .",
    "the values of @xmath70 and @xmath45 are shown for each curve .",
    "the transition time for the corresponding levels at given diameter is indicated near the vertical arrows.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]",
    "we have shown that interaction of electrons confined in a non - polar quantum dot with local vibrations of amorphous polar environment provides an efficient energy relaxation channel for the `` hot '' electrons .",

    "energy relaxation in quantum dots with smaller diameters should be controlled by multiphonon processes .",
