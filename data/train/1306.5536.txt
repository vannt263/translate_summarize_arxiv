    "two notions that have been particularly well explored in the context of quantum information of continuous variable states are _ nonclassicality_@xcite and _ entanglement_@xcite .",
    "the ` older ' notion of entanglement has become one of renewed interest in recent decades for its central role and applications in ( potential as well as demonstrated ) quantum information processes@xcite , while the concept of nonclassicality , which emerges directly from the _ diagonal representation_@xcite had already been well explored in the quantum optical context@xcite , even before the emergence of the present quantum information era .",
    "a fundamental distinction between these two notions may be noted : _ while nonclassicality can be defined even for states of a single mode of radiation , the very notion of entanglement requires two or more parties_. nevertheless , it turns out that the two notions are not entirely independent of one another ; they are rather intimately related@xcite .",
    "in fact , nonclassicality is a prerequisite for entanglement@xcite . since a nonclassical bipartite state whose nonclassicality can be removed by local unitaries could not be entangled , one can assert , at least in an intuitive sense , that _ entanglement is nonlocal nonclassicality_.    an important aspect in the study of nonclassicality and entanglement is in regard of their evolution under the action of a channel",
    ". a noisy channel acting on a state can degrade its nonclassical features@xcite .",
    "similarly , entanglement can be degraded by channels acting locally on the constituent parties or modes@xcite .",
    "in fact , there are channels that render every bipartite state separable by acting on just one of the parties@xcite .",
    "such channels are said to be _ entanglement - breaking_. we may recall that a channel @xmath0 is a linear completely positive trace - preserving map that takes a state @xmath1 of a system @xmath2 to state @xmath3 of system @xmath4 .",
    "that is , @xmath5 for every @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "further , @xmath8 is a physical state ( i.e. , unit - trace positive operator ) for every input state @xmath9 of the extended composite system @xmath10 , with the environment @xmath11 assumed to be arbitrary@xcite : this is the notion of complete positivity ( cp ) .    in the present work",
    "we address the following issue : _ which channels possess the property of ridding every input state of its nonclassicality ? _ inspired by the notion of entanglement - breaking channels , we may call such channels _ nonclassicality - breaking channels_. the close connection between nonclassicality and entanglement alluded to earlier raises a related second issue : _ what is the connection , if any , between entanglement - breaking channels and nonclassicality - breaking channels ? _ to appreciate the nontriviality of the second issue , it suffices to simply note that the very definition of entanglement - breaking refers to bipartite states whereas the notion of nonclassicality - breaking makes no such reference . in this paper",
    "we show that both these issues can be completely answered in the case of bosonic gaussian channels : nonclassicality - breaking channels are enumerated , and it is shown that the set of all nonclassicality - breaking channels is essentially the same as the set of all entanglement - breaking channels .    we hasten to clarify the caveat ` essentially ' .",
    "suppose a channel @xmath0 is nonclassicality - breaking as well as entanglement - breaking , and let us follow the action of this channel with a local unitary @xmath12 .",
    "the composite @xmath13 is clearly entanglement - breaking .",
    "but local unitaries can create nonclassicality , and so @xmath13 need not be nonclassicality - breaking .",
    "we say @xmath0 is _ essentially nonclassicality - breaking _ if there exists a fixed unitary @xmath12 dependent on @xmath0 but independent of the input state on which @xmath0 acts , so that @xmath13 is nonclassicality - breaking . we may stress that this definition is not vacuous , for given a collection of states _ it is generically the case that there is no single unitary which would render the entire set nonclassical_. [ this is not necessarily a property of the collection : given a nonclassical mixed state @xmath14 , it is possibly not guaranteed that there exists an unitary @xmath12 such that @xmath15 is classical .",
    "] it is thus reasonable to declare the set of entanglement - breaking channels to be the same as the set of nonclassicality - breaking channels if at all the two sets indeed turn out to be the same , modulo this ` obvious ' caveat or provision .",
    "gaussian channels are physical processes that map gaussian states to gaussian states .",
    "they are generalization of symplectic ( metaplectic ) unitaries , generated by hamiltonians quadratic in the mode operators , which too map gaussian ( pure and mixed ) states into gaussian states@xcite .",

    "<S> nonclassicality and entanglement are notions fundamental to quantum information processes involving continuous variable systems . that these two notions are intimately related has been intuitively appreciated for quite some time . </S>",
    "<S> an aspect of considerable interest is the behaviour of these attributes of a state under the action of a noisy channel . </S>",
    "<S> inspired by the notion of entanglement - breaking channels , we define the concept of nonclassicality - breaking channels in a natural manner . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the notion of nonclassicality - breaking is essentially equivalent  in a clearly defined sense of the phrase ` essentially'to the notion of entanglement - breaking , as far as bosonic gaussian channels are concerned . </S>",
    "<S> this is notwithstanding the fact that the very notion of entanglement - breaking requires reference to a bipartite system , whereas the definition of nonclassicality - breaking makes no such reference . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis rests on our classification of channels into nonclassicality - based , as against entanglement - based , types of canonical forms . </S>",
    "<S> our result takes ones intuitive understanding of the close relationship between nonclassicality and entanglement a step closer . </S>"
