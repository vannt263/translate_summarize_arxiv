    "blazars are the most variable subset of agn .",
    "they show a variety of variability timescales",
    ". the longest timescales can be far longer than one year , while the shortest may be less than one hour .",
    "the variability with a timescale less than one day is often called intraday variability or idv , as first reported by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "strong idv phenomena have been observed in the radio domain in a large number of blazars .",
    "if interpreted as being source intrinsic , the short - timescale variability would require a very small emitting region and hence a very high apparent brightness temperature of @xmath0 , which is far beyond the inverse - compton limit of about @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the idv can be explained via extrinsic origin , e.g. , via interstellar scintillation ( iss ) .",
    "a strong support to the iss origin is the so - called annual modulation of the variability timescale , which is the result of the annual changes of the relative velocity vector between the scattering screen and the earth as the earth orbits around the sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". such annual modulation has been observed in a few idv sources , as mentioned by @xcite .",
    "very recently , the flat - spectrum radio quasar j  1128 + 5925 was found to show strong idv at centimeter wavelengths , and its idv timescale displays an annual modulation @xcite .",
    "therefore , its idv may be caused by iss . in optical",
    ", there is no previous report on its variability . in order to know the properties of its optical variability and to make a comparison to those of its radio variability",
    ", we performed an optical monitoring program on this object in 2007 may .",
    "here we present the results .",
    "the monitoring was performed with a 60/90 cm schmidt telescope at xinglong station , national astronomical observatories of china .",
    "the schmidt telescope , is equipped with a @xmath2 e2v ccd , which has a pixel size of @xmath3 and a spatial resolution of @xmath4 . when the system is used for blazar monitoring , only the central @xmath5 pixels",
    "are read out as an image .",
    "the monitoring was done in the @xmath6-band with exposure times ranging from 300 to 480 s , and covered the period from 2007 may 5 to 29 . because of the weather condition and observations of other targets , there are actually 11 nights of data on j  1128 + 5925 .",
    "the data reduction procedures include positional calibration , bias subtraction , flat - fielding , extraction of instrumental aperture magnitude , and flux calibration .",
    "we adopted radii of the aperture and the sky annuli as 3 , 7 , and 10 pixels , respectively , during the aperture photometry .",
    "three stars around j  1128 + 5925 were selected as comparison stars , as shown in the finding chart in figure  [ f1 ] .",
    "here we used differential photometry .",
    "for each frame , the instrumental magnitudes of the blazar and three comparison stars were extracted .",
    "the brightness of the blazar was measured relative to the average brightness of the three comparison stars .",
    "the differential magnitudes of star 3 ( it has similar brightness to the blazar ) relative to the average of all three stars were also calculated to verify the stable fluxes of the comparison stars and the accuracy of our measurements .",
    "the light curve of the whole monitoring period is shown in figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "it is clear that there is no strong internight variation , except at jd  2,454,235 , where the strongest internight variation occurred with an amplitude of @xmath7 mags when adopting the definition of @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f3 ] displays the intranight light curves on five most intensively monitored nights .",
    "the differential magnitudes of star 3 are very stable at around @xmath8 with the exception of the last four points on jd  2,454,237 . on this night , the relatively low signal - to - noise ratio of the last four ccd images resulted in the observed increasing brightness of star 3 , and the large error bars on the light curve of the blazar .    in all five intranight light curves , the brightness of the object shows only some small - amplitude oscillations around a constant average , and do not demonstrate any clear tendency to become brighter or fainter . in fact , the apparently random , small - amplitude oscillations on very short timescales suggest that the oscillations may be due mainly to noise .",
    "a quantitative assessment was performed on whether or not the object was variable on these five nights .",
    "we employed the frequently used criteria adopted by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we follow the convention of defining c such that @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the standard deviation of the magnitudes of the blazar and @xmath11 is that of the comparison star . when @xmath12 , the object can be claimed to be variable at the 99% confidence level .",
    "table  1 lists the results .",
    "all five @xmath13 s are less than 2.0 , implying that j  1128 + 5925 was not variable on these five nights .",
    "although the monitoring periods on individual nights are only 1.28 to 2.71 hours long ( see table  1 ) , the average observed brightness actually continued on longer timescales , and in some cases may have extended to the next night ( e.g. , from jd  2,454,240 to 41 and from jd  2,454,248 to 50 ) .",
    "therefore , j  1128 + 5925 did not show strong variability on internight timescale , and even did not vary on intranight timescale in this period of time .",
    "we performed an optical monitoring program on j  1128 + 5925 in the @xmath6-band from 2007 may 5 to 29 .",
    "our monitoring results indicate that in this period j  1128 + 5925 only showed trivial optical variability on internight timescale , and did not show any clear intranight variability .",
    "either this object was in a quiescent state in optical regimes in this period , or it is intrinsically not as active at optical as it is at radio wavelengths .    some blazars that show strong idv in radio regimes also display rapid and strong variability in optical regimes , such as s5  0716 + 714 .",
    "this does nt seem to be the case for j  1128 + 5925 .",
    "this object exhibits strong idv at radio wavelengths , but not at optical wavelengths .",
    "it is easy to explain this difference if the optical and radio variabilities come from different origins : the optical variability may be intrinsic to the source ( the iss can not change the optical flux ) , while the radio variability is mainly the result of iss , as implied by the observations of @xcite .",
    "we present the first report on the optical variability of j  1128 + 5925 in this paper .",
    "however , because of the solar conjunction and observations of other targets with the telescope , our monitoring did not last long .",
    "more observations are needed to know whether or not this object is always optically quiescent .",
    "multi - band optical monitoring is also necessary to constrain its optical variability in more detail .",
    "of particular interest is to carry out simultaneous optical and radio monitorings on this object in order to make a more direct comparison between the variabilities at these two wavelengths .",
    "future campaigns can investigate whether there is correlated optical idv when strong radio idv is observed .",
    "if such correlations are detected , it would be strong evidence that both the optical and radio variability structures are intrinsic to the source , as in the case of s5  0716 + 714 @xcite .",
    "the broadband variability is also helpful to derive for this object some basic parameters , such as the mass of the central supermassive black hole , the boosting factor of the relativistic jet , etc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
