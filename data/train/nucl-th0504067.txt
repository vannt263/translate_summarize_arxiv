    "so , it is not obvious that according to the basic principles of eft the short distance ambiguities are , as one might expect , indeed under control .",
    "moreover , the existence of a well behaved finite renormalized limit is never guaranteed _ a priori _ and one relies mainly on numerics .",
    "actually , the fact that the results on deuteron observables look rather similar , regardless on the particular way how the potential is modeled at short distances , proves that the long distance pion dynamics dominates the physics confirming the findings of glendenning and kramer  @xcite more than 40 years ago , but does not resolve the mathematical problem whether the ope potential can make unambiguous predictions regardless of any short distance physical scale .",
    "the ope potential is local in coordinate space where the problem is naturally formulated by the standard schrdinger framework .",
    "moreover , it is singular at the origin and giving boundary conditions at that point is not a well defined procedure for uniquely determining the solution  @xcite ( for a comprehensive review in the one channel case see e.g. ref .",

    "the normalizability condition of the deuteron wave functions eliminates all constants for a given deuteron binding energy , which instead of being predicted has to be treated as an independent parameter .",
    "one of the advantages of the coordinate space treatment of renormalization is that it can directly be extended to other singular cases such as the two pion exchange ( tpe ) potential  @xcite which is also finite everywhere except the origin .",

    "the converging exponential is non - vanishing although rather elusive because its contribution to the deuteron wave function only becomes sizeable at relatively large distances and accurate numerical work must be done to pin down its value with a certain degree of confidence .    in the present work",
    "we show that there is no need to truncate the ope potential on a physical scale to produce unique and cut - off independent predictions for deuteron properties and scattering observables in terms of the ope potential parameters and the deuteron binding energy .",

    "the details of the perturbative calculation are postponed to appendix  [ sec : pert ] where we present a coordinate space version of the method , in consonance with the exact treatment .",
    "a detailed comparison shows that the perturbative argument is too naive and would only hold in the weak coupling regime as well , due to the appearance of non - analytical contributions in the @xmath9 coupling constant .",

    "obviously , such a transformation can not simultaneously diagonalize the kinetic terms , but the residual mixing is related to the derivative of a local mixing angle which numerically turns out to be a slowly varying function . using this as a starting approximation we can determine in a perturbative fashion the asymptotic d / s ratio yielding the exact ope value with a @xmath13 accuracy .",

    "<S> ' '' ''    we analyze the deuteron bound state through the one pion exchange potential . </S>",
    "<S> we pay attention to the short distance peculiar singularity structure of the bound state wave functions in coordinate space and the elimination of short distance ambiguities by selecting the regular solution at the origin . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the so far elusive amplitude of the converging exponential solutions at the origin . </S>",
    "<S> all bound state deuteron properties can then be uniquely deduced from the deuteron binding energy , the pion - nucleon coupling constant and pion mass . </S>",
    "<S> this generates correlations among deuteron properties . </S>",
    "<S> scattering phase shifts and low energy parameters in the @xmath0 channel are constructed by requiring orthogonality of the positive energy states to the deuteron bound state , yielding an energy independent combination of boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze from the viewpoint of short distance boundary conditions the weak binding regime on the light of long distance perturbation theory and discuss the approach to the chiral limit . </S>"
