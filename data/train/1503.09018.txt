    "nickel oxide has received attention over several decades because it is the prototype of a correlated insulator . as early as 1937",
    "this material was cited as a counterexample to the bloch theory of solids@xcite : assuming strong ionicity , oxygen will be o@xmath4 leaving nickel to be ni@xmath5 or [ ar]3d@xmath6 .",
    "this means that @xmath7 electrons / spin direction have to be distributed over five ni 3d bands which could result in an insulating ground state only if one of the five bands were splitt off from the others over the entire brillouin zone .",
    "this is impossible , however , because at @xmath8 the five ni 3d bands converge into one 3-fold degenerate ( @xmath9 ) and one 2-fold degenerate ( @xmath10 ) level .",
    "band structure calculations for the paramagnetic phase of nio@xcite confirm this , showing three o 2p derived bands well below the fermi energy and a group of five ni 3d bands which are intersected by the fermi energy .",
    "+ this simple picture is modified in that nio undergoes an antiferromagnetic ordering transition at @xmath11 kelvin .",
    "thereby ni - ions in planes perpendicular to @xmath12 allign their magnetic moments parallel to each other , with the ordered moment in successive planes being antiparallel ( type ii antiferromagnetism ) .",
    "this structure is consistent with the goodenough - kanamori rules because all @xmath13 ni - o - ni bonds are antiferromagnetic in this way .",
    "band structure calculations within the framework of density functional theory ( dft ) for the antiferromagnetic phase reproduce the insulating ground state , but the band gap is only @xmath14@xcite whereas the experimental value is @xmath15@xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that dft does indeed give a rather accurate estimate of @xmath16 for the single - particle gap in nio@xcite if one does not use the band structure of kohn - sham eigenvalues - which have no true physical significance anyway - but calculates the ground state energy @xmath17 of finite clusters as a function of electron number @xmath18 and uses @xmath19 .",
    "the crucial point is , however , that nio remains an insulator even above @xmath2 so that the insulating nature of nio can not be explained by antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "+ there is general agreement by now that the true origin of the insulating nature of nio is the strong coulomb interaction between electrons in the ni 3d shell so that an adequate description requires a more accurate treatement of the electron - electron interaction .",
    "accordingly , a wide variety of methods for treating interacting electrons have been applied to nio over the years . amongst others",
    "there are calculations using the self - interaction corrected density functional theory@xcite , the lda+u formalism@xcite and the gw approximation@xcite which more recently , was also combined with the lda+u formalism@xcite .",
    "nio was also treated in the framework of the three - body scattering formalism@xcite and dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) , both for the paramagnetic@xcite and antiferromagnetic@xcite phase .",
    "moreover it was shown recently that within dft the agreement between calculated and measured band gap for antiferromagnetic nio is improved considerably if a more accurate density functional is used@xcite .",
    "+ a quite different - but very successful - approach was initiated by fujimori and minami@xcite .",
    "these authors showed that good agreement between theory and experiment could be obtained for angle - integrated valence band photoemission spectra if one focused on local physics by considering an octahedron - shaped nio@xmath20 cluster comprising of a single ni - ion and its six nearest neighbor oxygen ions .",
    "the eigenstates and eigenenergies of such a finite cluster can be calculated exactly by the configuration interaction ( ci ) ( or exact diagonalization ) method and the single - particle spectral function be obtained from its lehmann representation . the ci method was subsequently applied to the calculation of the angle - integrated valence band photoemission spectra of a number of transition metal compounds@xcite and was extended to simulate x - ray absorption spectra@xcite . in all cases the agreement with experiment is excellent and in the case of x - ray absorption spectroscopy the comparison of simulated and measured spectra by now is in fact becoming a routine tool for determining the valence and spin state of transition metal ions in solids@xcite .",
    "+ the reason for the success of the cluster method is that it takes into account the full coulomb interaction between electrons in the transition metal 3d shell in the framework of atomic multiplet theory@xcite . introducing the compound index",
    "@xmath21 ( where @xmath22 and @xmath23 for a 3d - shell ) the coulomb interaction between electrons in atomic shells can be written as@xcite @xmath24 here the @xmath25 denote gaunt coefficients the @xmath26 slater integrals and for a d - shell the multipole index @xmath27 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) was derived orginally to explain the line spectra of atoms and ions in vacuum , see ref .",
    "@xcite for an extensive list of examples .",

    "@xcite for the relation between hubbard-@xmath28 and hund s rule @xmath29 and the slater integrals ) but the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) is the only one that can actually be derived from first principles and gives correct results for free ions ( an instructive comparison of the eigenvalue spectra of the original hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) and various simplified versions was given by haverkort@xcite ) .",
    "@xmath30 contains diagonal terms such as @xmath31 but also off - diagonal terms where all four @xmath32 in ( [ h1 ] ) are pairwise different .",
    "the off - diagonal matrix elements are frequently discarded in dmft calculations@xcite because they exchange electrons and thus exacerbate the minus - sign problem in quantum monte - carlo calculations . on the other hand the matrix elements of these terms are of the same order of magnitude ( namely proportional to the slater integrals @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) as the differences between the various diagonal matrix elements in ( [ diagonal ] ) so that there is no justification for discarding them but keeping different diagonal matrix elements . + as will be seen below the variational cluster approximation ( vca ) proposed by potthoff@xcite allows to extend the scope of the ci method of fujimori and minami once more , to the calculation of thermodynamical quantities and band structures for strongly correlated electron systems . since",
    "the vca is based on exact diagonalization and therefore free from the minus - sign problem the full coulomb hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) including the off - diagonal matrix elements can be included . as could have been expected on the basis of the considerable success of the ci method in reproducing experimental spectra @xcite the vca achieves good agreement with experiment .",
    "the method of calculation has been described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite so we give only a brief description .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the nio lattice is @xmath35 where e.g. @xmath36 creates an electron with @xmath37-spin @xmath38 in the ni 3d orbital @xmath39 at the ni - site @xmath40 whereas @xmath41 creates an electron in the o 2p orbital @xmath42 at the o - site @xmath43 .",

    "an important detail is that there is a nonvanishing interaction only between ni 3d orbitals in the same ni ion .",
    "+ for a multiband system such as ( [ h0 ] ) the imaginary time green s function @xmath54 and self - energy @xmath55 are matrices of dimension @xmath56 with @xmath57 the number of orbitals / unit cell . in the following",

    "+ in the framework of the vca this problem is circumvented as follows@xcite : first , we note that @xmath60 $ ] involves only the interaction part @xmath30 of the hamiltonian ( via the interaction lines in the skeleton diagrams ) and the green s function @xmath62 ( via the green s function lines ) - the latter , however , is the argument of the functional .",

    "@xmath74 would be the linear combination of o 2p orbitals on the @xmath75 oxygen ions surrounding the ni ion under consideration which hybridizes with the d - orbital @xmath76 . in the case of the vca",
    "the ligands are purely mathematical objects which have no counterpart in the physical system and which are introduced solely for the purpose of constructing self - energies .",
    "accordingly , there are _ no _ terms coupling the clusters centered on neighboring ni ions in system ii which therefore consists of completely disconnected finite clusters .",
    "the crucial point is , that since the interaction parts of systems i and ii are identical by construction they have the same luttinger - ward functional @xmath71 $ ] . since the individual clusters of system ii are relativey small - they comprise 10 orbitals / spin direction - they can be treated by exact diagonalization and we can obtain all eigenstates of @xmath77 within @xmath78 above the minimum value . using these",

    "we assume that amongst the @xmath112 there is also a uniform or staggered magnetic field @xmath113 along the @xmath37-direction .",
    "this implies that the values of all single - particle parameters of the reference system must be taken as spin - dependent : @xmath114 which results in a spin - dependent self - energy , @xmath115 . for a staggered field",
    "we switch to the antiferromagnetic unit cell and assume that the @xmath116 have opposite sign at the two ni - ions in this cell .",
    "this means that the self - energy for an @xmath117-electron is @xmath118 at the first ni - ion and @xmath119 at the second ni - ion in the antiferromagnetic cell and vice versa for a @xmath120-electron ( @xmath89-sums now have to be performed over the antiferromagnetic brillouin zone ) . for a uniform field",
    "we retain the orginal unit cell and use the spin dependent self - energy at the single ni - ion in this cell . + we assume that we have found a stationary point @xmath121 for @xmath122 i.e. : @xmath123 for all @xmath40 and denote the grand potential for this solution by @xmath124 .",
    "since this is the paramagnetic stationary point all spin - odd parameters @xmath116 are zero . upon applying a small finite @xmath113 _ in the lattice system _ , @xmath64 therefore can be expanded as @xmath125 where the shifts @xmath126 and @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 are 2@xmath130 derivatives of @xmath64 at the point @xmath131 .",

    "the symbols give the calculated values , the lines are the expressions ( [ fit1 ] ) and ( [ fit2 ] ) . ]",
    "figure [ fig16 ] shows the staggered and uniform susceptibilites obtained in this way as a function of temperature .",
    "thereby the term @xmath137 was added to the lattice hamiltonian , so that the physical susceptibilities are given by @xmath138 the staggered susceptibility can be fitted accurately by @xmath139 with @xmath140 and @xmath141 whereas the uniform susceptibility can be fitted by @xmath142 with @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "the divergence of @xmath145 at @xmath2 is due to an eigenvalue of the hessian @xmath127 crossing zero at @xmath2 .",
    "+ interestingly the curie - weiss temperature @xmath146 is somewhat higher than the nel temperature @xmath2 .",
    "this can be understood as a consequence of the type - ii antiferromagnetic structure and ( weak ) antiferromagnetic exchange between ni - ions connected by a @xmath147-degree ni - o - ni bond ( an example would be two ni - ions at distance @xmath148 ) .",
    "for such a pair of ni ions there is a competition between the direct antiferromagnetic exchange ( mediated by the direct ni - ni hopping as described by slater - koster parameters such as @xmath149 ) and the ferromagnetic exchange due to hund s rule coupling on oxygen .",
    "let us assume that the net exchange constant between such a pair of ni ions is antiferromagnetic ( this is certainly true for the present calculation which does not include hund s rule exchange on oxygen ) .",
    "then , any given ni ion has @xmath150 neighbors of that type and in the type - ii antiferromagnetic structure the ordered moment of one half of these neighbors is parallel to the moment of the ion at the center whereas it is antiparallel for the other half .",
    "the exchange fields due to these @xmath150 neighbors therefore cancel and the nel temperature is determined solely by the antiferromagnetic superexchange with the @xmath75 neighbors connected by @xmath13-degree ni - o - ni bonds . on the other hand",
    "the parameter @xmath146 is a measure as to how strongly the antiferromagnetic exchange between spins opposes a uniform ferromagnetic polarization . for the case of a uniform ferromagnetic polarisation",
    ", however , the exchange fields from all @xmath150 @xmath148-like neighbors are parallel and therefore do contribute to @xmath146 .",
    "the discrepancy between @xmath2 and @xmath151 obtained in the vca calculation thus is to be expected .",
    "the experimental value @xmath152 k was given in ref .",
    "@xcite but being almost four times the experimental nel temperature this appears somewhat high .",
    "+ for a heisenberg antiferromagnet the constant @xmath129 would be given by @xmath153 using the values from the fits in figure [ fig16 ] with @xmath154 we obtain the reasonable values @xmath155 for @xmath156 and @xmath157 from @xmath158 .",
    "the smaller value for @xmath159 in the staggered case likely is due to the fact that in the computation of @xmath156 the magnetic field is applied to all orbitals in the unit cell whereas it acts only on the ni 3d orbitals in the case of @xmath158 .",
    "+ lastly we point out an interesting feature of these results : the matrix @xmath127 of second derivatives of @xmath64 with respect to the spin - odd parameters @xmath116 in ( [ chi_exp ] ) obviously is the same in the case of staggered and uniform susceptibility .",
    "only the quantities @xmath128 and @xmath129 are different . still , the resulting susceptibilities have a completely different but physically reasonable temperature dependence .",
    "to obtain the results presented so far only the paramagnetic solution was needed . if we want to discuss the antiferromagnetic phase itself we need to find stationary points with spin dependent parameters @xmath93 and this doubling of the number of parameters complicates the numerical problem of finding the stationary point .",
    "we recall that in the parmagnetic case a total of @xmath7 parameters were varied : @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath109 and @xmath162 ( moreover , @xmath105 always was a stationary point and with that value the last parameter @xmath106 is irrelevant ) .",
    "doubling all of the nonvanishing parameters would result in a total of @xmath163 parameters .",
    "using the newton method this is still numerically manageable but it turned out that a more severe problem appears .",
    "while it might seem that the more parameters @xmath93 one is varying the better an approximation for the self - energy results , calculations showed that the opposite is true . introducing too many symmetry - breaking parameters @xmath116 leads to unphysical solutions",
    "- one example is discussed in detail in appendix a. in fact it turned out that retaining more than @xmath164 - out of the @xmath7 possible - @xmath116 leads to unphysical solutions .",
    "accordingly , in the following we present solutions obtained with @xmath75 parameters @xmath93 . in choosing the @xmath116 to be kept we heuristically use the staggered susceptibility @xmath158 as a guidance .",
    "namely we can restrict the set of the @xmath116 in the expression ( [ chi_exp ] ) for @xmath158 to only @xmath164 and examine which combination still gives a @xmath158 which is closest to the one obtained with the full set of @xmath7 @xmath116 .",

    "this appears plausible because the physical mechanism that stabilizes antiferromagnetism in nio is the enhanced hopping for the @xmath10 electrons of one spin direction along the @xmath13-degree ni - o - ni bonds connecting sites on different sublattices .",
    "a spin dependent d - level - to - ligand hopping then clearly is the best way to simulate this effect in a cluster with only a single ni - ion . since we have set @xmath105 in the paramagnetic case",
    ", @xmath110 moreover is the only remaining parameter pertinent to the @xmath9 orbitals . in the following , the resulting solution will be referred to as af - i . + in addition there is a second type of antiferromagnetic solution where @xmath168 so that the hopping for one spin direction of @xmath10 electrons is exactly zero . in this case",
    "the only remaining spin - odd parameters to be varied are @xmath167 and @xmath169 ( since one spin direction of the @xmath10 electrons has zero hopping , the spin splitting of the @xmath10-like ligand , @xmath170 is irrelevant and can be set to zero ) .",
    "it should be stressed that in this case @xmath64 is stationary also with respect to @xmath165 , and the values @xmath171 remain stationary as in the paramagnetic case . despite the fact that only @xmath75 parameters are actually varied , the corresponding solution therefore is stationary with respect to all @xmath150 possible parameters of the cluster .",
