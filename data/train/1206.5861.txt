    "the general analysis of the evolution of material systems interacting with their own gravitational field is undoubtedly a very important and very difficult problem in general relativity . as usual in any physical theory , one can gain insight into the more difficult issues by considering idealized simplified models that , nevertheless , still preserve some of the relevant features of the general problem .",
    "one of these simplified examples was described some time ago by apostolatos and thorne @xcite .",
    "the material contents in this example is given by a cylindrical shell of counter rotating particles , and one is interested in the dynamics that results as a consequence of its interaction with its own gravitational field .",
    "as shown in @xcite , once some appropriate choice of coordinates is made , it is a straightforward matter to obtain a set of coupled equations for the evolution of the matter and field variables , which is described in some detail in the next section . in their original paper apostolatos and thorne were interested in general features of the evolution , in particular the possibility of naked singularities forming as the result of the collapse of these structures , but the detailed evolution of the shell in a situation close to one of its static configuration was only qualitatively mentioned , with no detailed results .",
    "this problem is interesting in particular because in the newtonian approximation the shell is either in a static configuration or performs periodic oscillations about this static configuration , but , once the radiative modes of the gravitational field are introduced , one expects these oscillations to be eventually damped as the results of the transfer of energy to the radiative modes .",
    "thus , in the fully relativistic description one expects to find the characteristic `` quasi normal ringing '' ( qnr ) , related to the `` quasi normal modes '' ( qnm)@xcite of the system .",
    "a recent analysis of the dynamics of the apostolatos and thorne model was given by hamity , et.al .",
    "we notice , however , that the approximations introduced in the explicit examples considered in @xcite are such that the radiative modes are effectively neglected , and , therefore , the results obtained are possibly relevant only close to the newtonian limit . a detailed analysis of the full relativistic equations in the linearized approximation was carried out by the present authors in @xcite , where we obtained the general solution for the harmonic modes with real frequencies , and considered the solutions obtained by general linear combinations of these modes .",
    "although in all the examples considered in @xcite we found a stable evolution under perturbations of ( essentially ) compact support , at least two questions remained unanswered .",
    "the first was the possible completeness of the mode expansion , and its relation to the initial value problem for the system .",
    "the second was the apparent lack of qnr in the example solutions .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to give answers to those questions .",
    "we first review in sections 2 and 3 , mostly for completeness , the main features of the model .",
    "then , in section 4 , we review the derivation of the periodic solutions in the linearized regime , introducing a modified form , as compared with that given in @xcite , that allows us to establish , in section 5 , the completeness of expansion in the context of the characteristic value problem for the system , and , therefore , the completeness of the mode expansion .",
    "this completeness , in turn , as discussed in section 6 , implies the linear stability of static configurations under this type of perturbations , a result that differs from some conclusions reached in @xcite , and recent results obtained by kurita and nakao @xcite .",
    "next , in section 7 , we discuss the existence of qnms for the system .",
    "as shown there , these are related to the zeros of a complex expression that appears in the relation between the incoming and outgoing wave amplitudes as functions of the frequency .",
    "this expression has a complicated form involving bessel functions that makes it very difficult its analysis .",
    "for this reason we have not been able to obtain explicit expressions for the frequencies of the qnm , or even to ascertain whether there is finite number or infinite number of these frequencies . nevertheless , by resorting to numerical methods we found at least a couple of qnm corresponding to a range of parameters characterizing static configurations .",
    "the values obtained are also displayed in section 7 . in section 8",
    "we consider the numerical evaluation of the integrals obtained in section 7 that provide the evolution of the system for arbitrary characteristic data .",
    "the examples chosen display clearly the quasi normal ringing associated to one of the qnm .",
    "the reason why this qnr was not seen in @xcite is discussed in section 12 , using the price - husain toy model as an illustration .    in section 9",
    "we consider again the full relativistic equations and assuming a general linear departure from a static configuration obtain the general linearized equations for the system .",
    "then , in section 10 we prove the existence of an associated positive definite constant of the motion that puts absolute bounds on the dynamic variables of the system , establishing the stability of the motion of the shell under arbitrary , finite perturbations . in section 11",
    "we show that the corresponding set of coupled ordinary and partial differential equations for the relevant dynamical variables can be solved numerically as an initial plus boundary values problem , without resorting to expansions in terms of bessel or other functions .",
    "we provide a couple of examples , using the same shell parameters as in the mode expansion , but a different form for the incoming wave form .",
    "the results , that clearly display quasi normal ringing are in complete agreement with those of the mode expansion , and with the computed qnm frequencies , although the techniques used in both approaches are totally different , confirming their separate correctness .",
    "we end the paper with some comments and conclusions , as well as comments on related work by other authors , in particular to that of reference @xcite .",
    "the apostolatos - thorne model @xcite describes the dynamics of a self gravitating cylindrical shell of counter rotating particles .",
    "both the inner ( @xmath0 ) and outer ( @xmath1 ) regions of the shell are vacuum space times with a common boundary @xmath2 . the corresponding metrics may be written in the form , @xmath3 where the @xmath4 sign corresponds to the outside and @xmath5 to the inner regions .",
    "the functions @xmath6 , and @xmath7 depend only on @xmath8 and satisfy the equations : @xmath9 @xmath10\\ ] ] the shell is located on the hypersurface @xmath2 given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the proper time of an observer at rest on the shell .",
    "we may interpret @xmath13 as playing the role of a gravitational field whose static part is the analogue of the newtonian potential",
    ". the time dependent solutions of ( [ ateq2 ] ) represent gravitational waves ( einstein - rosen ) .",
    "equation ( [ ateq2 ] ) is the integrability condition of eqs .",
    "( [ ateq3 ] ) .",
    "the coordinates @xmath14 and the metric function @xmath6 are continuous across the shell @xmath2 , while @xmath15 and the metric function @xmath7 are discontinuous .",
    "smoothness of the spacetime geometry on the axis @xmath16 requires that @xmath17 , @xmath6 finite at @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the junction conditions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 through @xmath2 require the continuity of the metric and specify the jump of the extrinsic curvature @xmath20 compatible with the stress energy tensor on the shell .",
    "the induced metric on @xmath2 is given by @xmath21    here @xmath22 .",
    "the evolution of the shell is characterized by @xmath23 , which is the radial coordinate @xmath24 at the shell s location and @xmath12 the proper time of an observer at rest on @xmath2 .",
    "if we assume that the shells is made up of equal mass counter rotating particles , the einstein field equations on the shell may be put in the form , @xmath25 @xmath26 where the constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 are , respectively , the proper mass per unit killing length of the cylinder and the angular momentum per unit mass of the particles . the other quantities in ( [ ateq5],[ateq6 ] ) are given by , @xmath29 @xmath30 where a dot indicates a @xmath12 derivative , and we also have , @xmath31   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac { r^2 \\psi^-_{,n } x^-}{r^2+e^{2 \\psi_{\\sigma}}j^2 } -\\frac{\\lambda r^2 x^-}{(r^2+e^{2 \\psi_{\\sigma}}j^2)^{3/2 } } + \\frac{j^2 e^{2 \\psi_{\\sigma}}x^-x^+}{r(r^2+e^{2 \\psi_{\\sigma}}j^2)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these equations together with ( [ ateq2],[ateq3 ] ) determine the evolution of the shell and of the gravitational field to which it is coupled .",
    "we briefly review the conditions for a static solutions , corresponding to a shell of constant radius @xmath32 .",
    "we restrict to the case of a regular interior . in this case",
    "the interior must be flat and we may take @xmath33 , @xmath34 , implying @xmath35 . for the exterior field",
    "the general static solution ( satisfying @xmath35 ) is of the form , @xmath36 then , @xmath37 since @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , we find , @xmath41\\ ] ] and , @xmath42 it is important to notice that this relation can be satisfied for real @xmath43 , @xmath28 and @xmath27 only if @xmath44 , with @xmath45 therefore , the system admits static solutions only if @xmath44",
    ".    it will be convenient to write @xmath46 . replacing in ( [ eq4a ] )",
    ", we find , @xmath47 which we now consider as an equation for @xmath48 as a function of @xmath27 .",
    "it is now easy to check that there are no real solutions for @xmath48 if @xmath49 .",
    "for @xmath50 we have a double solution @xmath51 .",
    "the interesting region for our analysis is the range @xmath52 where we have _ two _ real and positive solutions for @xmath48 , one larger and one smaller than @xmath53 , which approach respectively @xmath54 and @xmath55 as @xmath56 .",
    "this implies that for appropriate @xmath27 and @xmath28 we have _ two _ static solutions .",
    "it was concluded in previous analysis @xcite that , at least from a perturbative point of view , one of these solutions ( the one with the larger @xmath43 ) would be stable and the other ( with the smaller @xmath43 ) would be unstable .",
    "this conclusion , as shown in the following sections , is _ not _ supported by the present analysis of the perturbative evolution that follows from initial data in the neighborhood of either static configuration . in the next section",
    "we derive the appropriate equations for a perturbative analysis , and then show how this construction can be used to solve the evolution equations given characteristic data .",
    "in this section we consider the problem of finding linearized periodic solutions for our system imposing the condition of a regular interior .",
    "this problem was already considered in @xcite , where the main idea was to obtain stationary periodic solutions , but left open the problem of relating these solutions to the initial value problem . here",
    "we will consider a slightly modified approach , where we express the solutions in @xmath57 in terms of incoming and outgoing wave solutions for the radiative part of @xmath58 .",
    "we first notice that if we impose regularity on the symmetry axis @xmath59 , and assume that the interior region is empty but may contain gravitational radiation , then @xmath60 admits periodic solutions of the form @xcite , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a bessel function , and we consider @xmath63 as a quantity of first order in perturbation theory .",
    "then , restricting again to linearized order we may set , @xmath64 since , in this case , from ( [ ateq3 ] ) , @xmath65 is of second order , and , therefore , also to the appropriate order , we may also set , @xmath66 we assume a periodic perturbation around an equilibrium configuration characterized by @xmath43 and @xmath28 and therefore take , @xmath67 where we assume that @xmath68 is also of first order .",
    "we need to specify now a corresponding solution for @xmath58 . in our previous analysis , @xcite",
    ", we noticed that the general periodic perturbation for @xmath58 may be written as , @xmath69 e^{i \\omega_+ t_+}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is a bessel function and @xmath71 and @xmath72 are first order quantities . to this order",
    "we have , @xmath73 e^{i \\omega_+ t_+}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are given by ( [ eq3a ] ) .",
    "a straightforward calculation @xcite shows that consistency of the equations at first order requires @xmath76 , @xmath77 and , @xmath78 replacing now in ( [ ateq5 ] ) , ( [ ateq6 ] ) , and ( [ ateq9 ] ) , and expanding to first order , we find a set of three linear independent equations for @xmath63 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath68 , for every choice of @xmath79 , @xmath43 and @xmath28 , and , therefore , three of these quantities can be solved in terms of the fourth . since all the evolution equations are linear , we may consider linear superpositions of these solutions to obtain more general ( non periodic ) solution . in @xcite",
    ", for simplicity , we chose @xmath68 as the independent variable , and obtained corresponding expressions for the other three amplitudes . assuming an arbitrary dependence of @xmath68 on @xmath79 , given by the function @xmath80 , @xmath23 is given by , @xmath81 while for @xmath82 and @xmath83 we obtain expression in the form of fourier transforms of @xmath80 multiplied by complicated expressions involving bessel functions of @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "details are given in @xcite .",
    "we notice that although in principle , ( [ eq12da ] ) is completely general , and one has a definite @xmath80 for any possible @xmath23 , in practice , what one would like to solve is the problem of the evolution of the system given some initial condition , and because of the structure of the equations that resulted in @xcite , the best one could do was to assume some form for @xmath80 , and find the corresponding evolution of the system . carrying out this program",
    "it was found there that there are rather general evolutions , in the sense that they represent the interaction of the shell with an incoming gravitational pulse of rather arbitrary shape , for which the response of the shell is given precisely by @xmath80 .",
    "an important question here is actually how general these solutions of the problem are , namely , whether they include every possible evolution of the system , or on the contrary , they only represent a restricted set .",
    "since we had no proof of the completeness of the set of modes , this question is highly non trivial .",
    "further , the scheme developed in @xcite did no appear to show the quasi normal modes and quasi normal ringing expected in a system such as this , that has a simple newtonian limit , where the shell can execute periodic motions .",
    "one would expect that the presence of radiative modes in the general relativistic version should lead to damped oscillations , at least in some appropriate limit , and this was not immediately apparent in the discussion given in @xcite .",
    "as we shall show here , both the completeness problem and the question of the qnr can be answered by a simple change in the formalism presented in @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved as follows .",
    "the expression , @xmath86\\ ] ] where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are constants , is a solution of ( [ ateq2 ] ) for @xmath58 . for large @xmath24 , using the asymptotic expansions for the bessel functions @xmath62 and @xmath70 , we find , @xmath89 and , therefore , ( [ eq5d ] ) represents a purely incoming wave solution of ( [ ateq2 ] ) .    similarly , @xmath90\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is a constant , is a solution of ( [ ateq2 ] ) , for @xmath58 , which , for large @xmath24 has the asymptotic behaviour , @xmath92 and , therefore , ( [ eq7d ] ) represents a purely outgoing wave solution of ( [ ateq2 ] ) .",
    "we notice now that we have , @xmath93 e^{i \\omega_2 t_+}\\ ] ] therefore , instead of ( [ eq4da ] ) we may write the full solution for @xmath94 in the form , @xmath95 where we have the identifications : @xmath96    in what follows we will consider @xmath87 and @xmath91 as first order quantities . to this order , from ( [ ateq3 ] ) , we have , @xmath97 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are given by ( [ eq3a ] ) .",
    "the important point here is that we have now expressions for @xmath58 and @xmath98 where we have separate amplitudes for the incoming and the outgoing wave parts .",
    "notice that since ( [ eq9d ] ) is just a reordering of terms in ( [ eq4da ] ) , all the previous relations regarding @xmath99 , @xmath79 , and @xmath100 are valid .",
    "then replacing again the expressions for the dynamic variables , but using now ( [ eq9d ] ) and ( [ eq10d ] ) , in ( [ ateq5 ] ) , ( [ ateq6 ] ) , and ( [ ateq9 ] ) , and expanding to first order , we find this time a set of three linear independent equations for @xmath63 , @xmath87 , @xmath91 , and @xmath68 . in this paper",
    "we will be mainly interested in the evolution of an initially static shell , under the influence of a bounded incoming compact pulse .",
    "we choose therefore to solve these equations for @xmath63 , @xmath91 , and @xmath68 in terms of @xmath87 .",
    "the resulting explicit expressions are , unfortunately , rather long and difficult to read .",

    "it is not difficult to show that @xmath104 has no zeros for real @xmath79 .",
    "a zero of @xmath104 for real @xmath79 would imply that the imaginary part of @xmath107 vanishes .",
    "but this is given by , @xmath108 where we have used properties of the bessel functions to obtain the right hand side , and , therefore , the imaginary part is non vanishing for all @xmath79 .",
    "this result is crucial , because it means that if @xmath87 depends regularly on @xmath79 , the solutions obtained using ( [ 13d1 ] ) and ( [ 13d2 ] ) are well defined modes for all @xmath79 in @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , because of linearity , arbitrary linear combinations of these modes will also be solutions of the problem . before discussing the possible completeness of this set of modes we will write explicit forms for the expressions we have in mind .",

    "we remark , for completeness , that ( [ 16d ] ) , for real @xmath79 , represents the most general solution for @xmath113 , such that both @xmath114 are bounded for large @xmath24 .",
    "consider again ( [ 16d ] ) .",
    "the problem that we have in mind is one where at some given time the shell and a large neighbourhood of the space time that includes the shell and the symmetry axis , are in a static state , but there is a finite gravitational pulse incoming from large @xmath24 . in other words ,",
    "if @xmath43 corresponds to a static solution , then for some large time in the past and some @xmath115 , the solution in @xmath116 coincides with the static solution . for @xmath117 ,",
    "on the other hand , there is region where @xmath113 is non vanishing . to make this more precise",
    ", we recall that for large @xmath24 an incoming wave solution for @xmath94 has the asymptotic form , @xmath118 where @xmath119 is an arbitrary function of ( essentially ) compact support .",
    "we may compare this with the asymptotic form for large @xmath24 of ( [ 16d ] ) , @xmath120 which can be inverted to give , @xmath121    therefore , we find a one  to ",
    "one relation between @xmath111 and characteristic data given for @xmath122 , @xmath123 . in this sense , we have proved the following result : _ the set of modes given by ( [ 13d1 ] ) and ( [ 13d2 ] ) , used in the construction of ( [ 16d ] ) and ( [ 17d ] ) is complete , and , in particular , ( [ 16d ] ) and ( [ 17d ] ) provide the evolution of the corresponding dynamical variables for arbitrary characteristic data given at @xmath122 , @xmath123 .",
    "_    in the next two sections we shall use these results to analyze the stability of the static solutions and then consider the presence of quasi normal modes ( qnm ) and their associated quasi normal ringing ( qnr ) .",
    "conceptually , we may say that a static configuration of the shell is stable if , given data arbitrarily close to that configuration , the system evolves towards that static configuration .",
    "otherwise we would say that the static configuration is unstable .",
    "but , as we have already indicated , we have explicit forms for the evolution of the system when it is perturbed from an initially static configuration by an incoming gravitational pulse of ( essentially ) compact support .",
    "each one of these pulses is uniquely characterized by a corresponding function @xmath111 .",
    "concentrating in particular on @xmath124 , we have , @xmath125 and , using ( [ 13d2 ] ) , we can check that for large @xmath79 , @xmath126 plus terms of order @xmath127 . as consequence , on account of ( [ 17d ] ) , and our assumptions on @xmath111 , @xmath124 is the fourier transform of a square integrable function for _ any _ @xmath28 and @xmath43 , but then , we must have @xmath128 for @xmath129 , and , therefore , _ all _ static configurations are stable .",
    "more explicitly , we have shown that all finite admissible gravitational pulses incoming from large @xmath24 can be described by an appropriate function @xmath111 , and that this function is in one - to - one correspondence with the shape of the pulse at large @xmath24 .",
    "we have also shown there is a unique evolution for the system corresponding to each function @xmath111 .",
    "this evolution is such that the dynamic variables are essentially given by the fourier transform of a square integrable functions and , therefore , they are themselves square integrable and must vanish in the limit @xmath130 . but",
    "this shows that all initially static configurations of the shell that are perturbed by an incoming pulse of the type described above , will eventually settle back to their original static configuration , and , in this sense , they are all _ stable .",
    "_    just for completeness , it should be clear that we have not found a self adjoint extension associated to the coupled partial plus ordinary system of differential equations of this problem , so that we could not state completeness of the mode expansion in the same way as when such an extension is possible .",
    "what we have found is that the characteristic value problem can indeed be solved by our mode expansion , since it reduces essentially to a fourier transform , and , that in this sense , the expansion is complete , and proves that the static configurations of the system are stable under a perturbation that has the form of a bounded , ( essentially ) compactly supported incoming pulse . but this is essentially all that is required to consider the system physically stable .",
    "it is still an open and interesting question to find the relation , if it exists , between the system of equations governing the evolution of the system and an associated self adjoint problem that would be more useful an the analysis of the initial value problem .",
    "nevertheless , as show in section 10 , for the general initial plus boundary value problem we have a conserved , positive definite constant of the motion , and therefore we have stable evolution for any finite initial data .",
    "+ we have already seen that for a shell with given values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 there may be just one , two or no static solutions of the equations of motion .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that in the case of two solutions only one is stable and the other is unstable .",
    "however , our present analysis does not show a qualitative difference in the behaviour of two static solutions under perturbations .",
    "there appears to be , nevertheless , a more subtle difference between the solutions when we analyze the evolution in more detail .",
    "this is related to the presence of quasi - normal modes , and is considered in the next section .",
    "in this section we analyze the presence of quasi normal modes and the associated quasi normal ringing in our system .",
    "very roughly , qnm and qnr appear in systems coupled to a field that admits a decomposition in periodic incoming and outgoing waves.(see e.g. @xcite for more details , and further references ) .",
    "generally qnm are associated to non trivial solutions where the incoming wave amplitude vanishes .",
    "this requires , generally , a complex value for the period , and therefore , in general , the corresponding outgoing and other amplitudes are unbounded in space and time , and , therefore , are not physical . in our problem , we have seen that for the periodic solutions , the dynamical variables other than @xmath111 are given by expressions of the form @xmath131 , and therefore , qnm , that is , nontrivial solutions with @xmath132 , can exist only for values of @xmath79 such that @xmath133 .",
    "we have already seen that @xmath104 is non vanishing for _ real _ @xmath79 , but it may vanish for _ complex _ values of @xmath79 .",
    "these zeros of @xmath104 introduce complex poles in the expressions for @xmath134 and the other field variables whose complex frequency does not depend on @xmath87 although the amplitude of their possible contributions does depend on @xmath87 .",
    "since @xmath134 , @xmath63 and @xmath91 are given by fourier transforms of these expressions containing complex poles , we may get contributions dominated by these poles .",
    "these are the qnr amplitudes associated to the qnm .",
    "therefore , to find the qnm we need to find the complex zeros of @xmath104 . in principle",
    "this is the simple matter of solving the equation @xmath133 for @xmath79 .",
    "unfortunately , if we consider the explicit expression for @xmath104 given by ( [ 13d2 ] ) , we notice that it contains bessel functions of different types and arguments depending on @xmath79 , so that only a numerical computation of the zeros appears as feasible , but even in this case the accurate computation of these zeros is a complicated task . in this paper",

    "these parameters are in good agreement with those corresponding to the qnm with @xmath139 for @xmath158 shown in table i.    as a second example we took @xmath156 and @xmath166 .",

    "this result is also in good agreement with the fact that the qnm for @xmath167 shown in table i corresponds to a strongly damped oscillation .",
    "we remark once again that the analytic structure of the integrand in ( [ 17d ] ) is far from simple , and that although several sets of complex qnm frequencies can be established rather accurately , their effect on the resulting amplitudes can not be easily established .",

    "we first obtain , @xmath172 in these equations @xmath74 and @xmath75 are given by ( [ eq3a ] ) and ( [ eq4a ] ) , so that the zeroth order terms coincide with the static solution of section iii . from these , again to first order we find , @xmath173 the explicit form of the terms of order @xmath171 is not required in what follows . choosing appropriately some integration constants we set , @xmath174    next we replace in the matching conditions and expanding again to first order we obtain two equations for @xmath175 and @xmath176 on the boundary @xmath177 @xmath178 and an equation of motion for @xmath124 , @xmath179    for explicit numerical integration it turns out to be convenient to introduce instead of @xmath180 a new function @xmath181 defined by , @xmath182 and , therefore , satisfying the equation : @xmath183 this way all the dynamic variables involved evolve directly in terms of @xmath12 .",
    "this simplifies the numerical treatment of the problem as it eliminates the need of separate grid spacing for @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "but , most important , using @xmath186 we may demonstrate the existence of a crucial constant of the motion , as is shown in the next section .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , we have a complete solution for characteristic data , and we can use this fact to prove stability regarding the evolution resulting from that type of data .",
    "this , nevertheless , leaves still open the question of the evolution of general initial data . in other words , the possibility of the existence of initial data that somehow is not registered as characteristic data , but such that it renders the motion unstable , in the sense that , i.e. @xmath124 can acquire arbitrarily large values starting from finite initial data . to answer this question we consider again ( [ eq05h ] ) ,",
    "replace @xmath176 in terms of @xmath186 , and solve for @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "we get ,    @xmath189    and , @xmath190    replacing now ( [ stab01 ] ) and ( [ stab02 ] ) in ( [ eq06h ] ) , upon multiplication by @xmath191 , and some rearrangement , we find ,    @xmath192    we notice that the first line ( [ stab03 ] ) has the form of a total @xmath12-derivative .",
    "we may put the whole expression in this form as follows .",

    "i.e. , @xmath205 .",
    "notice that @xmath206 is positive definite for any non trivial solution of the equations of motion .",
    "therefore , it provides an absolute bound for each term in ( [ stab07 ] ) .",
    "thus , if at any time @xmath12 all the terms in ( [ stab07 ] ) are finite , then they will remain finite for any evolution that satisfies the condition of regularity for @xmath59 , demonstrating the absolute stability of the system under any finite perturbation for which all the terms in ( [ stab07 ] ) exist .",
    "of course , a simple example is the case of an incoming wave of ( essentially ) compact support , for which we have already demonstrated the stability .",
    "we should further notice that the term , @xmath207 in the second line of ( [ stab07 ] ) allows for mild compensating divergences of @xmath208 , and @xmath209 , provided they are compatible with the existence of the integrals in ( [ stab07 ] ) .",
    "we notice nevertheless that , taking into account ( [ stab01 ] ) , and ( [ stab02 ] ) , we may also write @xmath210 in the alternative forms , @xmath211 and , since both @xmath210 and @xmath124 are bounded , we find that both @xmath187 and @xmath188 must also remain bounded , and this implies that @xmath212 is also bounded . on account of ( [ eq02h ] ) , this result implies that @xmath213 is also bounded to first order .",
    "we remark that @xmath65 is directly of second order and vanishes to first order .",
    "therefore , the full metric remains bounded under arbitrary perturbations .",
    "one can now check that the system ( [ eq01 ha ] ) , ( [ eq05h ] ) , ( [ eq06h ] ) , and ( [ eq08h ] ) , with appropriate replacements of @xmath176 by @xmath186 , can be used to set up and solve numerically the initial plus boundary value problem where , for some arbitrarily chosen @xmath214 we give arbitrary values to @xmath215 , @xmath216 , to @xmath217 and @xmath218 , in the interval @xmath219 , and to @xmath220 and @xmath221 , in the interval @xmath222 , subject to the constraints @xmath223 , and those resulting from ( [ eq05h ] ) .",
    "although this procedure is well defined , and leads to a unique evolution for appropriate initial data , at least in its cauchy domain , we must remark that the well - posedness of this type of problems , as regards sensitivity to small changes in the initial data , is still an open and interesting issue , outside the limits of the present research .",
    "the purpose of this exercise is mainly to display the evolution of some appropriately chosen initial data , in particular of @xmath124 , in the region where we may expect the presence ( or absence ) of quasi normal ringing .",
    "as we shall see , this behaviour , at least in the region analyzed , is in complete agreement with our previous results .",
    "the integration procedure we have chosen uses a simple finite difference method for updating @xmath175 in @xmath224 , and for @xmath186 in @xmath225 , where @xmath226 is some appropriately chosen outer boundary .",
    "the values of @xmath134 are updated using a simple leap frog scheme .",
    "once these updates are carried out , we use the matching conditions ( [ eq05h ] ) to update @xmath175 , and @xmath186 at @xmath177",
    ". we will be mainly interested in the behaviour of @xmath134 as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "on this account we choose some appropriate value of @xmath227 and boundary condition for @xmath186 at @xmath227 , but carry out the integration only from @xmath228 to @xmath229 , to ensure , by causality , that no signal coming in from @xmath230 has time to reach @xmath177 and affect that behaviour .",
    "in particular , in all the examples below we set @xmath231 , while we chose @xmath232 for the first and second example , and @xmath233 for the other two examples .",
    "the first explicit example of the results of this numerical integration for @xmath124 is given in fig.4 and fig .",
    "the initial data used was : @xmath234 and we set @xmath156 , @xmath157 , corresponding to @xmath158 , and @xmath232 . in fig .",
    "4 we display the evolution of @xmath124 as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "the graph corresponds clearly to an evolution dominated by qnr , although a more detailed analysis indicates the presence of a small non oscillating background at large @xmath12 . in fig 5",
    "we have a plot of @xmath235 ( thick line ) in the region dominated by the damped oscillation mode .",
    "the thin line curve corresponds to an approximate fit with the function @xmath236 , although the actual plot in fig .",
    "5 has been displaced up by 0.5 for clarity .",
    "we can see again the very clear signal of a damped oscillation , with a frequency and fall off in very good agreement with those of the example of fig .",
    "2 , although we have used a different procedure and form for the incoming pulse . the agreement might probably improve using a more elaborate rather than our simple minded implementation of the numerical procedure . in any case , it was not the purpose of the authors to optimize it but rather to show that even with a simple implementation we can solve the initial value problem related to the perturbation treatment of the dynamics of our system close to a static configuration , and obtain results in perfect agreement of those extracted from the mode expansion .",
    "as a second full numerical example we considered again the initial data given ( [ eq09h ] ) , but setting @xmath156 and @xmath166 , that is @xmath167 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "6 . in this case , in agreement with our analysis of the qnm , we find a very strongly damped oscillation , very much like that shown in fig 3 .",
    "for the same value of the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath28 , although the computational procedures applied in each case were completely different .",
    "we can also check that both the frequency and damping are in good agreement with the values given in table i for @xmath167 and positive real part for @xmath79 .    as a final example , we present the numerically computed evolution of @xmath124 as a function of @xmath12 for the cases @xmath156 and @xmath237 , that is @xmath238 , given as the thin line curve in fig . 7 , and for @xmath156 and @xmath239 , that is @xmath240 , also given in fig .",
    "7 as the thick line curve . in these examples",
    "the qnr is over damped and no trace of `` ringing '' is apparent in the time dependence of @xmath124 . in particular , the last case , @xmath240 ,",
    "corresponds to @xmath241 in the notation of @xcite , where in what they call the first class solutions one has a pure imaginary qnm frequency , and , therefore , we would have only a purely exponentially decreasing qnr .",
    "these plots confirm also the stability of the corresponding static configurations .",
    "in this section we consider the problem of the apparent discrepancy between the evolutions obtained using the formalism developed in @xcite and those described here .",
    "we shall illustrate the reasons for this by considering the qnm toy model given by price and husain in @xcite , since , as will be seen , it bear a certain formal resemblance to the shell model discussed here .",
    "the price and husain model consists of two torsion strings , the first attached at @xmath242 and extending to @xmath243 , where it is attached to a second string that extends to @xmath244 .",
    "the strings have different characteristic constants , so that the respective equations of motion are , @xmath245 and , @xmath246 where @xmath247 is a constant .",
    "@xmath248 , and @xmath249 , represent the torsion angle respectively in the intervals @xmath250 , and @xmath251 .",
    "the boundary and matching conditions are , @xmath252    the general solutions of ( [ eeq01a ] ) and ( [ eeq01b ] ) , are , @xmath253 where @xmath254 is , in principle , an arbitrary function of @xmath255 , and we have included the boundary condition at @xmath242 , and , @xmath256 where @xmath257 , and @xmath258 are also functions of @xmath255 .    one can now check that , imposing the matching conditions , and assuming that all the functions vanish for large values of their arguments , the general solution functions @xmath254 , @xmath257 , and @xmath258 satisfy the relations , @xmath259 \\nonumber \\\\ g(t - k x ) & = &   \\frac{1}{2 k } \\left [ ( k-1 ) f(t - kx+ka+a)-(k+1)f(t - kx+ka - a ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and , therefore , an arbitrary @xmath254 determines a complete solution of the problem . in particular , if we choose @xmath254 of compact support , we will also get @xmath87 and @xmath91 of compact support .",
    "this type of solution describes then an incoming pulse of compact support that approaches the junction at @xmath243 , excites a non vanishing @xmath260 for a finite time , and gives rise to an out going pulse , also of compact support .",
    "there is , in general , no `` ringing '' , as no quasi normal mode is excited .",
    "this is precisely the situation considered in @xcite , where we could fix the function @xmath124 arbitrarily , and , by choosing it of compact support we got also @xmath60 and @xmath58 of compact support , with no quasi normal ringing .",
    "but the price and husain model does display qnr . to see how this comes about we assume that the functions admit fourier transforms of the form , @xmath261 replacing in the system ( [ eeq08 ] ) we eventually find that we may write",
    ", @xmath262 } { { { \\rm e}^{2\\,i\\omega a } } \\left ( 1+k \\right ) -k+1 } } d \\omega\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these expressions provide the solution for the problem of finding the evolution assuming that we are given an incoming pulse @xmath263 as the data for the problem , just as in the present shell problem .",
    "if @xmath264 has suitable analytic properties it may be possible to compute the integrals in ( [ eeq11 ] ) by extending the path of integration to the complex @xmath265 plane .",
    "we notice here that the denominators in ( [ eeq11 ] ) have simple poles at , @xmath266 where @xmath267 is an integer , including zero .",
    "notice that all @xmath268 have the same positive imaginary part , and , therefore , when it is possible to close the path of integration by adding an infinite semicircle in the upper half plane of @xmath265 , each one of these poles will contribute a factor of the form @xmath269 times an oscillating factor depending on @xmath267 and on the explicit form of @xmath264 .",
    "these are the characteristic features of the `` ring down '' associated with the quasinormal modes .",
    "in fact , if we go back to ( [ eeq08 ] ) , and write it in the form , @xmath270 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "g(t ) & = &   \\frac{1}{2 k } \\left [ ( k-1 ) f(t+ka+a)-(k+1)f(t+ka - a ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and assume @xmath271 we get , @xmath272 \\exp(i \\omega ( t - k a ) ) \\nonumber \\\\",
    "g(t ) & = &   \\frac{1}{2 k } \\left [ ( k-1 ) \\exp(i \\omega a)-(k+1 ) \\exp(-i \\omega a ) \\right ] \\exp(i \\omega ( t+k a))\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the condition @xmath273 corresponds to a purely out going wave for @xmath274 .",
    "this is achieved precisely for @xmath265 of the form ( [ eeq12 ] ) .",
    "taken literally , these type of solution correspond to both @xmath275 and @xmath276 that decrease exponentially for @xmath277 , but increase exponentially as @xmath278 .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath279 that grows exponentially for large @xmath48 . these solutions are therefore unphysical .",
    "what is then the relation between these solutions and the poles in ( [ eeq11 ] ) ?",
    "the crucial point is that the poles are effective only if the integration path can be closed on the upper half plane of @xmath265 . in general , for @xmath280 , this requires @xmath281 , and therefore , the exponential terms are not present for @xmath255 , and as a consequence @xmath15 , less than a certain lower bound .",
    "but , why do we see a ring down in one case and not in the other ? to understand what is happening here we go back to ( [ eeq13 ] ) , and assume that @xmath254 has a fourier transform @xmath282 .",
    "then , replacing in ( [ eeq08 ] ) , we find , @xmath283\\ ] ] but this implies that for general @xmath282 , the transform @xmath284 will contain a factor that precisely cancels the denominators in ( [ eeq11 ] ) , and therefore there will be no ring down in the solution of the problem , unless , of course , @xmath285 itself contains the appropriate poles , as in ( [ eeq11 ] ) .",
    "the general conclusion is then that both ( [ eeq08 ] ) and ( [ eeq11 ] ) provide a complete solution of the problem and are , therefore , completely equivalent .",
    "clearly , for the purpose of making the qnr apparent it is simpler and , in a sense , more `` natural '' to use ( [ eeq11 ] ) and specify freely @xmath257 , i.e. , the incoming pulse shape , just as was done for the shell problem in the present work .",
    "in this paper we have considered again the perturbative analysis of the static configurations of the apostolatos and thorne shell model by modifying the formalism developed in @xcite . as a result we have been able to show the completeness of the mode expansion as regards the characteristic data problem for the perturbative dynamics of the shell .",
    "this , in turn , provides a simple and direct proof of the stability under bounded ( symmetry preserving ) perturbations of the general static configurations of the shell .",
    "we have also derived a set of coupled linear ordinary and partial differential equations that describe the general perturbative evolution of the shell .",
    "this set of equation can be used to set up an initial value problem for the shell that can be solved numerically , but , more importantly , one can prove the existence of a positive definite constant of the motion , that implies the stability of the motion resulting for an arbitrary perturbation .",
    "in several examples considered we find perfect agreement between the full numerical evolution and that obtained through the numerical integration of the mode expansion , although they are completely different in detail . at first sight",
    "our results seem to be in contradiction with those of kurita and nakao @xcite .",
    "we believe that there is no contradiction here , and that our computations and those in @xcite are perfectly compatible .",
    "the problem appears because kurita and nakao conclude that the existence of certain complex zeros ( or poles ) in the complex @xmath265 plane automatically imply a direct effect on the evolution of the shell , but this is not necessarily the case . the usual arguments for relating these poles to the evolution relay rather heavily on the possibility of extending integrals on the real @xmath265 axis to the complex @xmath265 plane , in such a way that one effectively picks up the residues of those poles , but this may not always be possible , and , even",
    ", it might happen that one can disregard those poles , when they exist , by extending the integration path in the opposite direction .",
    "in fact , since the mode expansion involves bessel functions in rather complex combinations , the matter of finding the extensions of appropriate function to the complex @xmath265 plane is a highly nontrivial undertaking .",
    "going back to our own derivations , we notice that although we found qnm with a negative real part of @xmath265 , we only find evidence of qnr for those with a positive real part for @xmath265 .",
    "we remark once again that the mode expansion does not require explicit consideration of the complex @xmath265 plane , as only the real @xmath265 axis is involved .",
    "we believe that although the work @xcite is valuable as regards the finding of the qnm of the system , since these by themselves are unphysical ( they diverge generally in some space or time direction ) , given the very complex nature of the functions and of their possible extensions to the complex plane , conclusions about the stability of the static configurations of the shell can only be reached by explicitly showing the relation between these modes and the general evolution of the shell .",
    "in fact , in view of our results concerning completeness of the mode expansion and its relation to stability , we can only conclude that all in principle unstable qnm must be suppressed , as well as possibly some of the stable ones .",
    "of course , explicit confirmation of this conclusion would require performing and analyzing appropriate extensions into the complex plane , but that is completely outside the scope of the present research .",
