    "the cosmological constant problem is usually described as a huge difference between the vacuum energy density derived by quantum field theories and the observed value of the cosmological constant .",
    "the energy density associated to the vacuum fluctuations of free fields is a divergent quantity , and any natural cutoff we use to regularize it ( for example , the planck mass or the energy scale of the quantum chromodynamic ( qcd ) phase transition , the latest cosmological vacuum transition ) leads to values many orders of magnitude above the observed @xmath0 .",
    "but the applicability of flat - spacetime quantum field theory in the expanding universe is doubtful , since a non - vanishing bare cosmological constant is not compatible with a flat spacetime .",
    "the vacuum contribution to ( semi - classical ) gravity is only properly calculated when one considers a non - flat background and renormalizes the divergent contributions in some appropriate way .",
    "this is a difficult task and , in general , may depend on the renormalization method used . in the simpler case of free conformal fields in a de sitter spacetime @xcite ,",
    "the renormalized vacuum density is proportional to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the hubble parameter . in the high - energy limit",
    "this result can be used to obtain a non - singular cosmology , with an initial quasi - de sitter phase , giving origin to a subsequent radiation dominate period @xcite . however , in the present universe the above result leads to a very tiny vacuum term . on the other hand",
    ", it may well be possible that the observed cosmological term is just a cosmological constant of purely geometric nature . in this case",
    "there would be no natural ( micro- ) physical scale associated to it .",
    "furthermore , both the gravitational action of the quantum vacuum and the approximate coincidence between such a constant and the present matter density ( the cosmic coincidence problem ) would remain unexplained .    as long as this issue",
    "can not be solved on a fundamental level , ( semi- ) phenomenological models which avoid the theoretical difficulties pointed out above may help to get further insight into the problem . in this letter",
    "we argue that , by modeling the cosmological `` constant '' in terms of a decaying vacuum energy , it is possible to obtain a model which is competitive with the standard one from the observational point of view . a crucial point here is to consider the contribution of interacting fields to the vacuum energy .",
    "indeed , some authors have been arguing that the energy density associated to the qcd vacuum condensate in a low - energy de sitter ( or approximately de sitter ) spacetime is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 mev is the energy scale of the qcd phase transition @xcite . in the present universe",
    "this density is dominant when compared to the contribution of free fields , @xmath1 , and has the correct order of magnitude of the observed cosmological term . in this paper",
    "we will trace back this scaling law @xmath5 to a process of matter production in the expanding spacetime .",
    "let us consider a low - energy , spatially flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) spacetime , where non - relativistic dark particles of mass @xmath6 are created out of the vacuum at a constant rate @xmath7 .",
    "the particle number balance ( sometimes called boltzman equation ) for this process will be given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the particle number density at a given time .",
    "it can be rewritten as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the matter density .",
    "this equation is characteristic of models with interaction in the dark sector @xcite .",
    "this particle production from vacuum fluctuations necessarily involves a gravitational backreaction .",
    "in addition to equation ( [ conservacao ] ) we have the friedmann equation @xmath12 where @xmath0 is the vacuum contribution to the energy density .",
    "we shall assume @xmath13 for the vacuum pressure , admitting , however , @xmath0 to be time varying . the total energy density satisfies the conservation equation @xmath14 provided we take @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a constant of integration , which corresponds to a purely geometric cosmological constant .",
    "since there is no natural ( microphysical ) energy scale associated to this constant , it is disregarded here . in this way we have @xmath17 and equation ( [ conservacao2 ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath18    we can see that the particle creation is concomitant with a decay in the vacuum energy density . equation ( [ linear ] ) is the same time variation law ( [ schutz ] ) obtained in a quasi - de sitter spacetime when the contribution of the qcd condensate is taken into account @xcite . in this case",
    "we have @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the energy scale of the qcd phase transition . ] .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the association of the qcd energy scale with the observed vacuum energy is natural and , in some way , expected , since the qcd confinement , with breaking of chiral symmetry , is the last cosmological vacuum transition we know .",
    "the qcd condensate formed after this low energy transition gives , in a de sitter ( or approximately de sitter ) spacetime , the correct value of the cosmological term ( see below ) .",
    "furthermore , owing to the maximal symmetry of the de sitter background , the condensate pressure is the negative of its energy density , i.e. , the same equation of state associated to a cosmological constant .",
    "dividing equation ( [ linear ] ) by @xmath21 , using @xmath22 and specifying to the present time ( subscripts @xmath23 ) , we obtain @xmath24 in a de sitter universe ( @xmath25 ) we would have @xmath26 .",
    "that is , the particle creation rate would be equal ( apart from a numerical factor ) to the gibbons - hawking temperature associated to the event horizon @xcite . on the other hand , by taking @xmath27 for our present universe , we have @xmath28 and @xmath29 . the former relation is an expression of the old eddington - dirac large number coincidence @xcite , while the latter ( known as zeldovich s relation @xcite ) gives the correct order of magnitude for @xmath0 .",
    "the exact value of @xmath7 in ( [ rate ] ) ( and hence of @xmath30 ) will be given by observations in the next sections .",
    "once @xmath7 is fixed , no further fine - tuning will be necessary .",
    "the cosmological model to be built will have the same number of free parameters as the @xmath0cdm model , namely @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "from this section on we will analyze the cosmological model arising from a vacuum energy density scaling with time in accordance with the ansatz discussed above .",
    "when compared with the most precise observational constraints , the model will show a very good concordance and , in some cases , less tensions than in the standard case .",
    "therefore , besides providing a possible physical basis for the cosmological term , in the lines of the previous sections , it will also show to be competitive from the observational point of view .    with @xmath33",
    "we obtain , from the friedmann equations , the solution @xcite @xmath34 ^ 2 + \\omega_{r0 } ( 1+z)^4 \\right\\}^{1/2}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the present relative matter density , and we have added conserved radiation with present density parameter @xmath35 . as discussed in @xcite , for non - zero @xmath35 the expression ( [ hgeral ] ) is an approximate solution , differing only @xmath36 from the exact one , since @xmath37 . for @xmath38 ,",
    "the solution ( [ hgeral ] ) is exact .    for early times",
    "we obtain @xmath39 , and the radiation era is indistinguishable from the standard one . on the other hand , for high redshifts the matter density scales as @xmath40 .",
    "the extra factor @xmath31 - as compared to the @xmath0cdm model - is owing to the late - time process of matter production . in order to have nowadays the same amount of matter",
    ", we need less matter in the past . or , in other words , if we have the same amount of matter in the past ( say , at the time of matter - radiation equality ) , this will lead to more matter today .",
    "we can also see from ( [ hgeral ] ) that , in the asymptotic limit @xmath41 , the solution tends to the de sitter solution .",
    "note that , like the @xmath0cdm model , the above model has only two free parameters , namely @xmath31 and @xmath32 . on the other hand",
    ", it can not be reduced to the @xmath0cdm case except for @xmath42 . in this sense , it is falsifiable , that is , it may be ruled out by observations .",
    "the hubble function ( [ hgeral ] ) is all we need to test the model against observations of snia and bao @xcite . however , when testing the position of the first peak of the cmb anisotropy spectrum , some care is needed .",
    "the relation between the observed position of the peak and the acoustic scale @xmath43 is given by @xcite @xmath44 with @xmath45 evaluated at the redshift of last scattering @xmath46 .",
    "the acoustic scale is defined , as usual , by @xmath47 with the sound velocity @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 stand for the present density parameters of baryons and photons , respectively .",
    "the relation ( [ l1 ] ) does not depend on the dark energy model , but only on pre - recombination physics .",
    "however , the ratio @xmath51 is , in our case , given by @xmath52 with the extra factor @xmath31 as compared to the @xmath0cdm expression .",
    "note that , in all the above expressions , there is a dependence on @xmath32 through the relative densities of baryons , photons and radiation , as well as through the redshift of last scattering . in our analysis",
    "we will fix these parameters ( @xmath53 , @xmath35 , @xmath46 ) to the concordance values of the standard model .",
    "the only free parameters to be adjusted will then be @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the result of a joint analysis of snia , bao and the position of the first peak of the cmb spectrum is shown in figure [ figsdss ] . in the left panel",
    "we show the superposition of the corresponding confidence regions in the ( @xmath54,@xmath31 ) plane , where @xmath55(km / s)/mpc is the dimensionless hubble constant .",
    "the central panel shows the same for the @xmath0cdm model . in the right panel a comparison between the two models is made , after marginalizing over @xmath54 . in this analysis",
    "we have used the sdss snia compilation with the mlcs2k2 light - curve fitter @xcite .",
    "other current compilations make use of salt or salt2 fitters which , however , are not model independent . a more complete analysis , including the union2 and constitution compilations , can be found in @xcite . in the case of the constitution sample calibrated with mlcs2k2 ,",
    "the results are very similar to those presented here .",
    "note that for the standard model the relative matter density is higher than the usually accepted concordance value ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "this is a characteristic of the mlcs2k2 fitter , also present when we use it to calibrate the constitution sample .",
    "the analysis of the matter power spectrum was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where , for simplicity , baryons were not included and the cosmological term was not perturbed . in a subsequent publication a gauge - invariant analysis , explicitly considering the presence of late - time non - adiabatic perturbations , has shown that the vacuum perturbations are indeed negligible , except for scales near the horizon @xcite .",
    "therefore , the result of ref .",
    "@xcite can be considered a good approximation .",
    "an updated analysis is shown in the left panel of figure [ figpowersp ] , together with the 2dfgrs data points @xcite and , for comparison , the concordance @xmath0cdm fitting as provided by the bbks transfer function @xcite .",
    "it is also shown the @xmath57 confidence region for our fitting .",

    "the concordance value for the matter density is @xmath65 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the hubble parameter is smaller than in other estimations , but it has the same value obtained when the same snia sample is analyzed for the @xmath0cdm model ( see fig . [ figsdss ] ) . in what concerns the matter density parameter ,",
    "it is about @xmath66 higher than the flat standard model value for the sdss ( mlcs2k2 ) compilation ( @xmath67 ) . in both models",
    "the obtained values of @xmath31 are higher than the usually accepted concordance value for the flat @xmath0cdm model , and the same occurs when one uses the constitution sample calibrated with mlcs2k2 . a discussion about the present tension between different snia samples and fitters , in both models , can be found in @xcite . here",
    "we show , in table i , the best - fit results for @xmath31 ( with @xmath54 marginalized ) with three samples of supernovas : the sdss and constitution calibrated with the mlcs2k2 fitter , and the union2 ( which is calibrated with salt2 ) . in figure",
    "[ figure03 ] , on the other hand , the reader can find the evolution of the scale factor ( left panel ) and of the relative energy densities of radiation , matter and dark energy ( central and right panels ) in the two models .",
    "the concordance value obtained for @xmath31 is in agreement with estimates based on peculiar velocity measurements for galaxy pairs @xcite , but only in marginal agreement with dynamical estimations from clusters @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize , however , that such estimations are not very precise and that they involve a different scale .",
    "note also that the present result has an approximative character .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the inclusion of baryons in the analysis of the power spectrum may lead to a difference of about @xmath66 in the estimation of @xmath31 .    with the concordance values of @xmath54 and @xmath31 in hand ,",
    "we can obtain the age of the universe , as well as the redshift of transition between the decelerated and accelerated phases .",
    "they are given , respectively , by @xcite @xmath68 and @xmath69^{2/3}-1.\\ ] ] this leads to @xmath70 and @xmath71 , in good agreement with standard predictions and astronomical limits @xcite .",
    "for @xmath72 we have @xmath73 gyr .",
    "it is not easy to perform a full analysis of the cmb anisotropy spectrum with alternative models , specially if it involves new processes like particle production , for example . nevertheless , for at least some of the features we do not expect significant changes .",
    "first of all , radiation and baryons are assumed to be separately conserved ( there is no photon fluctuations from the vacuum at the tree level , and baryons are too heavy to be produced at late - times ) .",
    "therefore , the cmb temperature , the acoustic horizon at the last scattering and the relative height of the peaks will not be affected .",
    "on the other hand , the redshift of equality between matter and radiation in our model is given by @xmath74 where we can note again an extra factor @xmath31 as compared to the standard @xmath0cdm result . by using our concordance matter density @xmath75",
    ", we obtain @xmath76 , which does not differ too much from the standard value .",
    "( this is simply because @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , a relative matter density of around @xmath78 in the present model leads to the same @xmath79 of the standard model with @xmath80 ) . for this same reason",
    ", the matter density at the time of equality will be approximately the same in both models .",
    "[ by the way , this result for @xmath79 guarantees that the turnover of the matter power spectrum is correctly placed ( see fig .",
    "[ figpowersp ] and @xcite ) ] .",
    "as the redshift of last scattering is exactly the same @xcite , and the recombination does not depend on a particular dark energy model , both last scattering and recombination will occur in the matter dominated phase .",
    "all these results indicate that the absolute height of the peaks will not change either .",
    "( see the left panel of their figure 3 ) . on the other hand",
    ", they claim that this density leads to a matter power spectrum in disagreement with lss data , contrary to what we have obtained in @xcite . our present results , however , agree with those obtained previously in reference @xcite . ]",
    "the only important consequence of matter production on the cmb spectrum could be owing to the integrated sachs - wolf effect ( isw ) . in the right panel of figure [ figdcontrast ]",
    "we plot the gravitational potential @xmath81 ( @xmath82 is the matter density contrast and @xmath83 is the comoving wavenumber ) as a function of the redshift , for the einstein - de sitter , @xmath0cdm and @xmath84cdm models , for @xmath85mpc .",
    "the isw effect is proportional to the integrated change of the gravitational potential . as the right panel of fig .",
    "[ figdcontrast ] shows , the slope of the potential of our model differs from the corresponding slope of the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "but also here one may expect this effect to be small . in the @xmath0cdm model the potential decreases by @xmath86% between the last scattering and the present time , in our @xmath84 model it decreases by @xmath87% .",
    "note , however , that fig .",
    "[ figdcontrast ] is preliminary since it is based on a newtonian analysis @xcite . here",
    ", a more quantitative , fully relativistic analysis is necessary .    on the other hand , as can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ figdcontrast ] , there is a small difference in the gravitational potential as compared to the standard model , a difference that will affect the normalization of the cmb spectrum , since the sachs - wolf effect is proportional to @xmath88 .",
    "but the gravitational potential is proportional to the matter density contrast as well .",
    "therefore , if the latter is correctly normalized ( by using , for example , the bbks transfer function @xcite , as was done , e.g. , in @xcite and in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ figpowersp ] ) , the cmb spectrum will also have the correct normalization .",
    "in other words , in order to have the correct normalization today , we have more power in the cmb spectrum at high redshifts as compared to the standard case .",
    "the coincidence problem within the @xmath0cdm model is usually phrased as : why @xmath89 and @xmath0 are of the same order of magnitude just at the present epoch ?",
    "our model relies on dark - matter particle production at a constant rate . from the outset",
    ", this rate is a free parameter . by eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) it is assumed here to be of the order of the hubble constant . for our model the coincidence problem translates into : why the rate @xmath7 is of the order of the present - time hubble rate @xmath90 ( and not of the order of the hubble rate at a different time ) ?",
    "any other value of @xmath7 would not be compatible with the observed cosmological dynamics .    compared with the @xmath0cdm model , the coincidence problem",
    "is alleviated , however , in the sense that @xmath91 @xcite , whereas in the @xmath0cdm model one has @xmath92 .",
    "any decay of the ratio @xmath93 that is less than @xmath94 can be considered as an alleviation of the coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "this difference in the background dynamics also influences the behavior of the perturbations . as the left panel of fig .",
    "[ figdcontrast ] shows , the present model deviates from an einstein - de sitter universe already at higher redshifts than the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "moreover , while the perturbations within the latter approach a constant value for decreasing @xmath95 , in our model there appears a maximum around the present epoch and perturbations are suppressed for @xmath41 .",
    "the origin and nature of the dark sector is probably the central theoretical problem of modern cosmology .",
    "the non - zero tiny value of the cosmological term and its coincidence with the matter density are some important faces of the question .",
    "relating dark energy with vacuum fluctuations is an old difficulty , but one may expect a potential solution if this problem is appropriately considered in curved spacetime .",
    "several models of dynamic vacuum have been suggested along these lines .",
    "models for accelerated expansion based on matter creation in the expanding background have previously been proposed , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "although a relation between dynamical dark energy and particle production is not mandatory , we think it represents an interesting option .",
    "this paper is based on the assumption that the late - time spacetime expansion can extract non - relativistic particles from the quantum vacuum . in the case of a constant creation rate ,",
    "the backreaction of this process leads to a vacuum density linearly proportional to the hubble parameter , a result previously obtained from estimations of the gravitational contribution of the qcd vacuum condensate .",
    "the resulting cosmological model is shown to be in accordance with the most precise observational tests , namely those which involve snia , the anisotropy spectrum of the cmb , the lss distribution and bao , albeit for higher values of the current matter density than in the standard model .",
    "another difference to the @xmath0cdm model may be a modified isw effect .",
    "this will be a subject of future research .",
