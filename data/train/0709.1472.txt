    "at least two absorption components are present . in the arc and het spectra ,",
    "the shape of the blue wing of the absorption profile ( as well as the residuals from two - component fits ) suggest that a third component at slightly lower velocity might be blended with the stronger absorption line , and examination of the higher - resolution keck spectrum confirms this .",
    "we fit the na  d@xmath26 and d@xmath27 absorption lines in each spectrum with three gaussian components using a levenberg - marquardt least - squares fit algorithm .",
    "each absorption component is given its own depth , width , and wavelength , but we hold the wavelength separation between the d@xmath26 and d@xmath27 lines fixed at its known value and we force the d@xmath26/d@xmath27 depth ratio to be the same for each component . including the continuum level , there are therefore 11 fitting parameters for 123308 spectral channels ( depending on the dispersion of each spectrum ) .",
    "we list the fit results in table [ na_fits ] .",
    "while the equivalent widths ( ews ) of components a and c appear to change somewhat across the three spectra , in fact these components are so badly blended in the arc and het spectra that the individual ews are not very well determined .",
    "instead of measuring the ews of these components separately with the gaussian profile fits , we directly integrate the spectra from 5921.50    to 5922.22   .",
    "the combined ews of components a and c in the three epochs are @xmath28  m , @xmath29  m , and @xmath30  m .",
    "component . the d@xmath26/d@xmath27 depth ratio ( and therefore the d@xmath26/d@xmath27 ew ratio ) is 0.64 .",
    "] we therefore conclude that there is no change in these absorption lines to a 3@xmath31 limit of 18  m  over the course of the observations .",
    "we estimate that the column density for components a and c is @xmath32  @xmath1 ( assuming a doppler parameter of @xmath33  km  s@xmath12 ; see table [ na_fits ] ) , and the change in the column between 4  d before and 24  d after maximum light is no larger than @xmath34  @xmath1 . the strength of component b , which is reasonably well separated from the other two , does not change within the uncertainties over the course of the observations , and we estimate a column density of @xmath35  @xmath1 for this component .",
    "we place 5@xmath31 upper limits on the presence of additional unresolved absorption components at other velocities of 15  m , 8  m , and 7  m  ( 9 , 5 , and @xmath36  @xmath1 ) for the arc , het , and keck spectra , respectively .",
    "in contrast , the time - variable features in sn 2006x reached column densities of up to @xmath37  @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the apo and keck spectra extend far enough to the blue that we also detect h&k absorption lines in both the milky way and ngc  5584 .",
    "we fit the four sets of lines simultaneously using the same technique as in ",
    "[ na ] . as with the na lines ,",
    "the host - galaxy absorption can be well fitted with two or possibly more components .",
    "their velocities and relative strengths , however , differ significantly from those of the na absorption components .",
    "the ca absorption systems have heliocentric velocities of 1643 and 1613  km  s@xmath12 , and the higher - velocity system is approximately 3 times as strong as the lower - velocity system ( ews of @xmath38 and @xmath39  m  in the k line , respectively ) .",
    "these results suggest that the various absorbing clouds along this line of sight have different abundances and/or ionization states .",
    "although the higher - velocity component appears somewhat deeper and the lower - velocity component appears narrower in the keck spectrum than in the apo data , we do not detect any statistically significant changes in the absorption line equivalent widths between the two epochs .",
    "the arc and het spectra cover the expected wavelength of the redshifted  line .",
    "we detect an  emission line in both spectra with a velocity of 1641  km  s@xmath12  and a full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 16  km  s@xmath12 . in the earlier , but lower s / n , arc spectrum ( @xmath40  d ) we measure an ew for the  emission of @xmath41  m , and in the het spectrum ( @xmath42  d ) we measure an ew of @xmath43  m . at these epochs , the supernova had @xmath44-band magnitudes of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively . within the uncertainties , therefore , the  flux did not change between the two observations .",
    "while  emission could be a signature of csm , we also find weak [ ]  @xmath476583 and [ ]  @xmath476717 features at the same velocity .",
    "the presence of these additional lines , the lack of variability in the  flux , and the close agreement between the host - galaxy velocity and the  velocity suggest instead that the emission is coming from a nearby  region .    assuming that the detected emission lines come from the host galaxy rather than the supernova",
    ", we place an upper limit on the  emission from the sn of 22  m  ( 5@xmath31 limit for a line width of 50  km  s@xmath12 ) at @xmath42  d and 33  m  at @xmath48  d. although the high - resolution spectra are not flux - calibrated , we can estimate the  limits in flux units by scaling the continuum flux level to the observed @xmath44-band magnitudes .",
    "we calculate an upper limit to the  flux of @xmath49  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath12 ( @xmath50  erg  s@xmath12 ) . using the model of @xcite ,",
    "the corresponding upper limit on the mass - loss rate in the progenitor system is not very restrictive ( @xmath51  m@xmath6  yr@xmath12 ) .",
    "several other nearby sne  ia have comparable or better limits from  observations @xcite .",
    "our observations of na absorption lines in  [ na ] can be used to estimate the amount of hydrogen along the line of sight to sn 2007af .",
    "the total measured column density is @xmath52  @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding hydrogen column is @xmath53  @xmath1 for a solar na abundance of 12 + log(na / h)@xmath54 @xcite , where @xmath55  n()/n(na ) is the na ionization fraction . if this material were all located in the sn progenitor system in a thin shell with a radius of @xmath4  cm ( as suggested by @xcite for sn 2006x )",
    ", the shell mass would be @xmath56  m@xmath6 .",
    "however , because of the lack of variations in the column density of the detected absorption lines and their close agreement with the host - galaxy velocity , the absorbing gas is more likely associated with the interstellar medium of ngc  5584 . in that case , the relevant calculation for the mass of the csm is based on the upper limits for additional absorption components . using the 5@xmath31 upper limits on the column density of 9 , 5 , and @xmath57  @xmath1 for the three spectroscopic epochs and the assumptions given above",
    ", we find corresponding upper limits on the shell masses of @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60  m@xmath6 , respectively . for comparison",
    ", @xcite estimated a shell mass of @xmath61  m@xmath6 for sn 2006x with the same model .",
    "if the circumstellar na ions have not yet fully recombined by the time of our observations , then the true csm mass could be significantly higher , but for sn 2006x substantial recombination had occurred within 2 weeks of maximum light .",
    "there are two primary ways to interpret the absence of variable absorption features in sn 2007af .",
    "first , the progenitor system may differ from the red - giant companion in a recurrent nova model that @xcite proposed for sn 2006x .",
    "in particular , @xcite found that sn 2006x has the highest expansion velocity ever measured for a sn  ia , which raises the possibility that varying d absorption features ( and hence the proposed recurrent nova progenitors ) could be associated with the subgroup of high velocity gradient sne  ia @xcite .",
    "if this conjecture is correct , it would suggest that the companion to the sn 2007af progenitor was either a main - sequence star , a subgiant , or another c / o white dwarf , leaving the progenitor system relatively free of circumstellar gas and dust .",
    "alternatively , the observational differences between the na  d lines in sne 2007af and 2006x could be a result of the system geometry .",
    "if the mass lost by recurrent novae is concentrated in the orbital plane of the system , as appears to be the case for rs oph @xcite , then lines of sight that do not pass near the orbital plane would miss most of the circumstellar material .",
    "such a configuration would allow the progenitor systems of sne 2006x and 2007af to be the same , as long as the viewing geometry is different .",
    "monitoring of the na  d lines in a larger sample of sne  ia will clarify the geometrical constraints , including possible additional geometries for the csm .",
    "it will also allow us to examine whether the presence or absence of variable absorption is related to any other observed properties of the objects .",
