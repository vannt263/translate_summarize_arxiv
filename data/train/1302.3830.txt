    "this paper is a continuation of the investigation in  @xcite of the extent to which chaos can be generic in cooperative boolean networks , where _ cooperativity _ is the absence of any negative interactions whatsoever .",
    "the introduction of  @xcite gives a detailed discussion of our motivation for studying this problem and additional references to related work ; here we will repeat only some essentials that are needed for understanding the results of this second part .",
    "cooperativity is a special case of the more general property of _ monotonicity , _ which is defined by the absence of feedback loops with an odd number of negative interactions . in monotone flows trajectories",
    "converge generically towards an equilibrium under mild regularity hypotheses ; see _ e.g. , _ @xcite .",
    "in particular , this result implies that chaotic trajectories are not generic in cooperative continuous flows . since",
    "many natural systems can be modeled with several types of dynamical systems , it is of interest to study whether the above result on nongenericity of chaos in monotone flows has counterparts for boolean networks .",
    "chaotic dynamics of boolean networks are characterized by very long attractors , very few eventually frozen nodes , and high sensitivity to perturbations of initial conditions  @xcite .",
    "these three hallmarks usually , but not always , go together . our focus",
    "in part  i  @xcite was on very long attractors . since the state space of an @xmath0-dimensional boolean network has size  @xmath3 , we were interested in upper bounds of the form  @xmath4 for constants @xmath5 .",
    "as in  @xcite we call an @xmath0-dimensional boolean network  _ @xmath6-chaotic _ if it does have an attractor of length  @xmath7 . if attractors of this length are reached with probability  @xmath8 from a randomly chosen initial condition , then we say that the network is  @xmath9-@xmath6-chaotic .",
    "thus @xmath9-@xmath6-chaos is a notion of genericity of chaos in terms of very long attractors , and it also implies genericity of chaos in terms of very few eventually frozen nodes ( proposition  3.2 . of  @xcite ) .",
    "expected dynamics of so - called _ random boolean networks ( rbns ) _ tends to become more chaotic as the number of inputs per node increases ( see , _",
    "e.g. , _ the surveys @xcite ) .",
    "the most stringent limitation of this kind is the assumption that the boolean network is _ bi - quadratic , _ that is , such that both the number of in- and outputs per node is bounded from above by  2 .",
    "the main result of  @xcite ( reproduced below as theorem  [ thm : ith ] ) is that that cooperative bi - quadratic boolean networks can still be @xmath9-@xmath6-chaotic .",
    "however , if we require that the system is _ strictly bi - quadratic , _ that is , all nodes have _ exactly _ two inputs and two outputs , then even @xmath6-chaos is possible only for @xmath10 and the bound is sharp  @xcite . here",
    "we will show that the same bound holds for strictly bi - quadratic @xmath9-@xmath6-chaotic cooperative networks ( theorem  [ thm : tenroot ] )",
    ".    the main focus of this second part will be the question whether cooperativity limits to some extent the sensitivity to perturbations of initial conditions in boolean networks .",
    "all by itself , @xmath9-@xmath6-chaos does not imply high sensitivity to initial conditions .",
    "in particular , @xmath9-@xmath6-chaos can coexist in cooperative boolean networks , for every @xmath11 , with _",
    "@xmath9-coalescence , _ which is the property that for two randomly chosen initial conditions @xmath12 that differ by a single - bit flip ( have hamming distance  1 ) with probability @xmath13 there will be some @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "there are several plausible ways of formalizing the notion of sensitive dependence on initial conditions , and we will study three such notions : @xmath9-instability , which in cooperative boolean networks is equivalent to the negation of @xmath9-coalescence , @xmath9-@xmath16-decoherence , and @xmath9-@xmath17-@xmath18-decoherence . intuitively , the latter two notions mean that a single - bit perturbation to a randomly chosen initial condition will with high probability lead to trajectories that have a relatively large hamming distance infinitely often .",
    "it turns out that the strongest of these notions , @xmath9-@xmath17-@xmath18-decoherence , does occur in some @xmath9-@xmath6-chaotic boolean networks ( proposition  [ prop : unccopdecohere ] ) , but is precluded by cooperativity ( theorem  [ thm : toostrongdamth ] ) .",
    "thus an analogue of the above mentioned theorem for monotone flows does hold for this particular formalization of the notion of chaos in boolean networks .    for @xmath9-instability and @xmath9-@xmath16-decoherence",
    "the situation is more subtle .",
    "we will show that for every @xmath19 there are bi - quadratic cooperative boolean networks that are simultaneously @xmath9-unstable and @xmath9-@xmath6-chaotic ( theorem  [ thm : cppth ] ) .",
    "but strictly bi - quadratic such networks can exist only if @xmath20 ( see subsection  [ subsec : strict - quadratic ] ) , and we show that this bound is again optimal ( theorem  [ thm : sqrt3 ] ) . in general , cooperative @xmath9-@xmath6-chaotic boolean networks can exhibit arbitrarily strong forms of @xmath9-@xmath16-decoherence ( theorem  [ thm:2dam - p ] ) .",
    "we prove that some versions of this property can occur under the additional assumptions that the network is bi - quadratic ( theorem  [ thm : decoh ] ) or even strictly bi - quadratic ( theorem  [ thm : decoh - bi ] ) .",
    "it remains an open problem to determine the maximal amount of @xmath9-@xmath16-decoherence that is possible under these additional assumptions .",
    "our terminology will be the same as in  @xcite , where the reader can find all relevant definitions . here",
    "we will only clarify some key points that are crucial for understanding the formulation of our results .",
    "the symbol  @xmath21 $ ] denotes the set @xmath22 , which is also the domain of @xmath0-dimensional boolean vectors  @xmath23}$ ] .",
    "each such @xmath24 is the characteristic function of the set @xmath25 = \\{i \\in [ n ] : \\ , s_i = 1\\}$ ] .",
    "it will sometimes be convenient to work with sets @xmath26 instead of boolean vectors  @xmath27 .",
    "note that in this interpretation a boolean function  @xmath28 is cooperative , which can be defined as preserving the coordinatewise partial order , if and only if it preserves the subset relation , that is , @xmath29 implies @xmath30 .",
    "it follows that every partial boolean function on a set of pairwise incomparable boolean vectors can be extended to a cooperative total boolean function ( see proposition 2.1 of  @xcite ) ; a fact that we will use several times .",
    "the symbol @xmath31 denotes the number of coordinates  @xmath32 with  @xmath33 ; equivalently , @xmath34 .",
    "the hamming distance @xmath35 between two boolean vectors + @xmath24 and @xmath36 with the same domain is the number of  @xmath32 with @xmath37",
    ". vectors with a hamming of  1 are said to differ by a single bit flip .",
    "as in  @xcite and elsewhere in the literature , we will use the terms ` boolean system ' and ` boolean network ' interchangeably .",
    "but we will carefully distinguish these dynamical systems from ` boolean circuits ' and ` boolean input - output systems ' which are layered arrangements of boolean gates that calculate certain boolean functions .",
    "boolean input - output systems , as opposed to boolean circuits , allow feedback loops between the variables ; both structures can be incorporated as building blocks into boolean networks to achieve desired dynamics .",
    "a boolean input - output system is bi - quadratic if every of its variables has indegree and outdegree at most  2 , where the indegree of a variable is the number of variables its regulatory function takes input from and the outdegree is to number of variables for which it serves as input .",
    "the system is strictly bi - quadratic if , in addition , every of its variables except the input variables has indegree exactly  2 .",
    "note that for boolean networks the latter requirement already implies that each variable must have outdegree exactly  2 as well ( since the sum of indegrees in any directed graph is equal to the sum of outdegrees ) , but due to external inputs and outputs this implication is in general false for boolean input - output systems .",
    "for easier reference , we state the main result of part  i  @xcite .    [ thm : ith ] given any @xmath38 and @xmath39 , for all sufficiently large @xmath0 there exist @xmath9-@xmath6-chaotic , @xmath9-coalescent , @xmath0-dimensional bi - quadratic cooperative boolean networks .",
    "our first formal definition of high sensitivity to initial conditions is the notion of @xmath9-instability that was introduced in  @xcite .",
    "a boolean system is _",
    "@xmath9-unstable _ if a random single - bit flip in a randomly chosen initial state moves the trajectory into the basin of attraction of a different attractor with probability at least  @xmath9 .",
    "note that for cooperative boolean networks @xmath9-instability is the same as the negation of ( @xmath40)-coalescence : if @xmath12 are two initial conditions that differ at exactly one variable , then we must have either @xmath41 or @xmath42 ; wlog assume the former .",
    "then cooperativity implies that @xmath43 for all times  @xmath44 .",
    "if the inequality is strict for all  @xmath44 , then the two trajectories must reach different attractors , since in cooperative boolean networks every two states in a given attractor are incomparable ( see , _ e.g. , _",
    "@xcite ) . if equality holds for some  @xmath44 , then the two trajectories coalesce",

    "another hallmark of chaotic dynamics in boolean networks is extensive damage propagation , which means that a small perturbation ( such as a single - bit flip in an initial condition ) tends to spread to a significant proportion of the nodes .",
    "the definition of @xmath9-instability does not account for this phenomenon .",

    "this requires adding @xmath549 new variables . by choosing @xmath545 large enough so that @xmath550 we do nt exceed the allotment of @xmath551 additional variables specified by  ( [ eqn : ratio - n1/n2 ] ) . finally , we add dummy variables if needed , and connect variables that have fewer than 2 outputs to variables  @xmath346 of copies of  @xmath343 .",
    "the resulting system will have the properties specified in theorem  [ thm : decoh - bi ] .",
    "in this paper and its prequel  @xcite we studied the problem whether cooperativity , that is , the total absence of negative interactions , precludes certain types of chaotic dynamics in boolean networks , at least under additional assumptions on the number of inputs and outputs per node .",
    "this is a natural question in view of the analogous result for continuous flows that was mentioned in the introduction , and the well - known fact that boolean networks with few inputs per node tend to have ordered dynamics",
    ".    chaotic dynamics of boolean networks is characterized by very long attractors , very few eventually frozen nodes , and high sensitivity to perturbations of initial conditions .",
    "while these three hallmarks usually go together , the answer to our question crucially depends on how chaos in boolean networks is formalized .",
    "the notion of @xmath9-@xmath6-chaos formalizes genericity of very long attractors and also implies genericity of very few eventually frozen nodes .",
    "we showed that cooperativity does not impose any nontrivial bounds on this property , even in bi - quadratic boolean networks .",
    "similarly , in strictly bi - quadratic networks , cooperativity does not imply additional bounds on @xmath9-@xmath6-chaos beyond the previously known bound of @xmath302 for @xmath6-chaos .",
    "however , the situation changes when one considers notions of high sensitivity to perturbations of initial conditions .",
    "the strongest such notion considered here , @xmath9-@xmath17-@xmath18-decoherence , while still possible in @xmath9-@xmath6-chaotic boolean networks in general , is outright precluded by cooperativity .",

    "the notion of @xmath9-@xmath16-decoherence comes in many flavors , depending on the parameter  @xmath16 .",
    "while it is consistent with cooperativity and @xmath9-@xmath6-chaos for all @xmath19 and all meaningful linear  @xmath16 in general , we were only able to construct bi - quadratic and strictly bi - quadratic boolean systems that satisfy this property under some additional restrictions on  @xmath9 , @xmath6 , and  @xmath16 .",
    "since any form of @xmath9-@xmath16-decoherence implies @xmath9-instability , there must be some such restrictions at least under the additional assumption that the system is strictly bi - quadratic .",
    "we conjecture that there are some restrictions for bi - quadratic systems as well .",
    "however , it remains an open problem to find the optimal upper bounds on the amount of @xmath9-@xmath6-chaos and @xmath9-@xmath16-decoherence that can simultaneously occur in such networks .",
    "thus cooperativity , by itself and in conjunction with suitable restrictions on the interactions of the variables , does impose restrictions on how much chaos is possible in a boolean network .",
    "these results can be interpreted as counterparts of the corresponding theorem for flows .",
    "our work shows that valid results of this kind require very specific conceptualization of certain hallmarks of chaotic dynamics .",
