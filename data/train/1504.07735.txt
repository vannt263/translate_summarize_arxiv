    "in 2013 , a neutron rich @xmath0 hypernucleus , @xmath1he was observed via the ( @xmath14 reaction , and an observed @xmath0 separation energy of @xmath15 mev was reported  @xcite .",
    "this observation stimulated us to study neutron - rich @xmath0 hypernuclei because in light nuclei near the neutron drip line , interesting phenomena concerning neutron halos have been observed .",
    "when a @xmath0 particle is added to such nuclei , it is expected that the resultant hypernuclei will become more stable against neutron decays due to the attraction of @xmath16 interaction and the fact that there is no pauli exclusion effect between nucleons and a @xmath0 particle .",
    "this phenomenon is one of the gluelike roles of @xmath0 particle .    before this measurement",
    ", we recently predicted in refs .",
    "@xcite the energy spectra of @xmath1he in the bound - state region within the frameworks of a @xmath17 three - body model and an @xmath18 four - body cluster model .",
    "the core nucleus @xmath7he is known to be a typical neutron halo nucleus : the two - neutron separation energy is 0.975 mev .",
    "the @xmath0 participation in the bound state of such a halo nucleus results in a more stable ground state of the hypernucleus .",
    "we predicted that the binding energy of the ground state is 5.36 mev within the @xmath2 four - body model which is consistent with the recent data within the error bar . for this ground state",
    ", we have another interesting insight related to the charge - symmetry breaking ( csb ) components in the @xmath16 interaction .",
    "it is considered that the most reliable evidence for csb appears in the @xmath0-separation energies ( @xmath19 ) of the @xmath20 hypernuclei with @xmath21 ( @xmath22h and @xmath22he ) .",
    "then , the csb effects are attributed to the separation - energy difference @xmath23he)@xmath24h ) , the experimental values of which are @xmath25 mev and @xmath26 mev for the ground ( @xmath27 ) and excited @xmath28 ) states , respectively .",
    "it is also likely that csb contribution affects to the binding energy of @xmath1he and the experimental research at jlab on the @xmath1he was motivated by this question . since consistent understanding of the csb in the @xmath16 interaction",
    "has not yet been obtained , further experimental studies of @xmath22h will be carried out in near future at jlab and mainz , and @xmath22he at j - parc .",
    "the experimental study of @xmath1he was performed again in 2009 with 5 times more statistics ( jlab e05 - 115 experiment ) .",
    "the preliminary result gives more accurate binding energy of the ground state , and the first excited state ( @xmath29 or @xmath30 ) was observed for the first time , which corresponds to the @xmath31 state of @xmath7he core nucleus coupled with @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "the observed @xmath31 state is located 0.827 mev above the @xmath10 breakup threshold with a decay width of @xmath33 mev  @xcite .",
    "the coupling of a @xmath0 to this state leads to bound states of @xmath1he .",
    "a high - resolution spectroscopy experiment of @xmath0 hypernuclei using an electron beam is one of the powerful tools to produce bound and resonant hypernuclear states .",
    "then , we have the following question : ` is there a possibility to have other new hypernuclear states in @xmath1he ? ' to answer this question , it is necessary to look at the energy spectra of @xmath7he core nucleus before studying @xmath1he .",
    "the observed data of @xmath7he @xcite reported @xmath34 round state as a bound state and the @xmath31 resonant state with @xmath35 mev , @xmath36 mev . to search the second @xmath6 state ,",
    "some experiments were performed .",
    "for example , the charge - exchange reaction , @xmath37 , was studied to explore the excited states above the first 2 + state  @xcite . however , clear evidence of the second 2 + state was not obtained .",
    "in 2012 , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the transfer reaction experiment @xmath38he shows an indication of the second @xmath6 state of @xmath7he as a resonant state at @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) mev .    theoretically , many authors studied energy spectra of @xmath7he with various theoretical approaches  @xcite . among them , for instance , one of the present authors ( t.m . ) and collaborators studied the energy spectra of @xmath7he within the framework of the cluster - orbital shell model ( cosm ) for the @xmath10 three - body system using the complex scaling method ( csm ) , that is one of the powerful methods to obtain resonant energies and decay widths accurately .",
    "they reproduced the energies of the observed ground state and the first @xmath6 state very well .",
    "moreover , they obtained second @xmath6 state at 2.52 mev above the @xmath10 threshold with width @xmath41 mev .",
    "when a @xmath0 particle is added to such a resonant state , due to a gluelike role of @xmath0 particle , it is likely to result in narrower resonant states of @xmath42 and @xmath43 of @xmath1he .",
    "the prediction of energies of second @xmath3 and @xmath4 states and decay widths would encourage further experimental investigation of @xmath1he at jlab . with this aim ,",

    "@xcite and references therein . using the csm",
    ", one can directly obtain the energy @xmath67 and the decay width @xmath68 of the @xmath69 and @xmath70 systems by solving the eigenvalue problem for the complex scaled schrdinger equation with a scaling angle @xmath71 , @xmath72 \\psi_{\\alpha nn ( \\alpha \\lambda nn)}(\\theta)=0,\\ ] ] where the boundary condition of the many - body outgoing wave is automatically satisfied for the resonance , giving @xmath73 that is , in principle , independent of @xmath71 .",
    "the complex scaled hamiltonian @xmath74 is obtained by making the radial coordinate transformation with the common angle of @xmath71 @xmath75 in the hamiltonian @xmath76 of the @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) system .",
    "the non - resonant continuum states are obtained on the @xmath77-rotated line in the complex energy plane .",
    "a great advantage of the csm is that a resonant state is described by an @xmath78-integrable wave function .",
    "therefore , the gaussian basis functions mentioned above have been successfully used in calculations of the csm  @xcite .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : scal - he6 ] , we show the distributions of eigenenergies ( @xmath79 ) of the complex - scaled hamiltonian @xmath80 for the @xmath81 states of the @xmath7he nucleus at @xmath82 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the @xmath83 three - body and @xmath84 two - body continuum states appear reasonably along the lines which are rotated from the real axis by @xmath77 .",
    "we find two @xmath6 resonance poles at @xmath85 mev with @xmath86 mev and @xmath87 mev with @xmath88 mev , respectively ; the latter pole is stable against the change of @xmath71 from @xmath89 to @xmath90 . in addition , we find the @xmath91 state to be at @xmath92 mev with @xmath93 mev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : he6level ] , we summarize the energy spectra of @xmath7he together with experimental data confirmed so far .",
    "the calculated energies of the @xmath27 ground state and the first @xmath6 excited state are in good agreement with the data .",
    "it is interesting to obtain the second @xmath6 state at 2.81 mev above the @xmath10 threshold with @xmath88 mev .",
    "recently , the spiral experiment suggests the existence of the @xmath94 state at 1.63 mev above @xmath10 threshold with @xmath95 mev  @xcite . for comparison , here we note that the @xmath94 state is calculated to be @xmath13 mev higher energy with a much broader width .",
    "the calculation for the second @xmath6 state of @xmath7he has been already performed in ref .",
    "@xcite within the cluster - orbital shell model ( cosm ) combined with the csm .",
    "they predicted this state to be at @xmath96 mev with @xmath41 mev using the minnesota @xmath97 interaction .",
    "although the av8 @xmath97 interaction is employed in the present work , we remark that both theoretical calculations give essentially the same results with respect to the resonance energy and the decay width .",
    "now we discuss the results for the hypernucleus @xmath1he .",
    "first , the calculated energy of the ground state ( @xmath98 ) is @xmath99 mev which corresponds to a @xmath0-separation energy of @xmath100 mev .",
    "this energy is the same as in ref .",
    "@xcite in the case of no csb component in the @xmath16 interaction .",
    "the jlab e01 - 011 experiment measured the @xmath101he reaction spectrum and deduced  @xcite for the first time the @xmath0-separation energy of the @xmath1he ground state to be @xmath102 mev .",
    "the theoretical prediction of @xmath103 is compatible with this value within the experimental error .",
    "second , in the present calculation , the first @xmath3 and @xmath4 states are obtained as bound states at @xmath104 mev and @xmath105 mev , respectively , with respect to the @xmath106 four - body breakup threshold ; these values are the same as in ref .",
    "@xcite in the case of no csb component in the @xmath16 interaction .",
    "it is noted that a recent analysis of the jlab e05 - 115 experiment  @xcite also reports an excited - state peak at @xmath107 mev .",
    "this peak can be well attributed to the present prediction of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 states , because the average theoretical @xmath0-separation energy for these states , @xmath108 mev , is in very good agreement with the experimental value .",
    "the agreement is confirmed also by the comparison of production cross sections for the ground and the excited states , since they are consistent with the theoretical estimation as will be shown below .",
    "third , we search for the pole positions of the second @xmath3 and @xmath4 state of @xmath1he within the complex scaling method ( csm ) . in fig .  [",
    "fig : he7level ] , we show the distribution of complex eigenvalues of the @xmath43 states at @xmath109 where the energy @xmath67 is measured from the @xmath2 four - body breakup threshold . we find the resonance pole of the @xmath43 state at @xmath110 mev with @xmath111 mev .",
    "this state is isolated from the continuum states of the @xmath112 and @xmath17 configurations and is stable against the change of the rotation angle , @xmath113 - @xmath114 . for the @xmath42 state ,",
    "we find the resonance pole at @xmath115 with @xmath116 mev .",
    "figure  [ fig : he67level ] summarizes the theoretical level structure of @xmath1he together with that of @xmath7he . in fig .",
    "[ fig : he67level ] , we see a small energy splitting for the second @xmath3-@xmath4 doublet states which is similar to the splitting of the first @xmath3-@xmath4 doublet .",
    "this is caused basically by the small spin - spin @xmath16 interaction .",
    "the @xmath91 state is obtained at @xmath117 mev with a decay width @xmath93 mev , very close to that of the @xmath94 level , as shown in fig.[fig : he67level ] .",
    "however , we did not find any particular influence of the @xmath91 state on the @xmath42 energy , probably because they have both large decay widths .",
    "one naturally expect to have the third @xmath3 state and the second @xmath118 state in this region of excitation . however , it was difficult to distinguish these states since these states were embedded into the four - body breakup continuum states .",
    "here we emphasize that , when the @xmath0 particle is added , the responses of two @xmath6 core states are so different that the energy spacing between the centroids of the first doublet ( @xmath119 , @xmath120 ) and the second doublet ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) in @xmath1he becomes quite large ( @xmath123 mev ) in comparison with the 1.85 mev spacing of the two @xmath6 states . this effect is attributed to the difference in size ( spatial structure ) of the two @xmath6 wave functions in @xmath7he .",
    "in fact the decay width of the @xmath124 resonant state is very small ( 0.11 mev ) , and the state is compact . on the other hand ,",
    "the decay width of the @xmath125 state is considerably large ( 4.63 mev ) .",
    "therefore it is expected that the radial extent of the wave function for the @xmath125 state is much larger than that of the @xmath124 state . when a @xmath0 particle is added to such states having different characters ,",
    "the energy gain , @xmath0 separation energy , in the compact state is much larger than that in the dilute state .",
    "a similar phenomenon has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely that the @xmath0 separation energy of the compact shell - like ground state , @xmath126 in @xmath127c , is much larger than that in a well - developed clustering state such as the @xmath128 state . if the predicted second doublet states ( @xmath121 and @xmath122 ) is confirmed in a future experiment , then we can see the clear state - dependent response to the addition of a @xmath0 particle .    next , it is interesting to investigate how we can confirm experimentally the energy positions of the @xmath42 and @xmath43 states predicted here in @xmath1he . in view of the successful e05 - 115 experiment  @xcite which already shows the ground state and the excited state peaks , the unique possibility is to perform a dedicated @xmath129he reaction experiment with better energy resolution in the future . for the sake of experimental feasibility study , here we give brief estimates of the @xmath9he reaction cross sections in dwia on the basis of the cosm results of the proton pickup spectroscopic amplitudes @xmath130 which are ready to be used .",
    "as for the @xmath131li target state with strong binding , we use the ordinary shell - model wave function of the maximum symmetric which corresponds to the @xmath132 cluster configuration in the lowest approximation .",
    "however , one should be careful in treating weakly bound or unbound states in @xmath7he .",
    "the low - lying states of @xmath7he have been studied extensively by the cosm with @xmath48 core in ref .",
    "@xcite which treats the many - body resonances in the complex scaling method ( csm ) . here",
    "we remark that the present three - body cluster model and the cosm treatment give essentially the same physical properties of nuclei . as explained in refs .",
    "@xcite , the choice of the relative coordinates in the model space of core+@xmath133+@xmath133 is different but the cosm gives the consistent results of core@xmath134 three - cluster model for the structures such as @xmath7he and @xmath135li  @xcite .",
    "it is also confirmed that the cosm and gamow shell model ( gsm ) give the same results for the @xmath7he structure for the energy eigenvalues , configuration mixing , and the density distribution of halo neutrons  @xcite . instead of using the 4-body cluster model wave functions",
    ", we make use of the proton pickup spectroscopic amplitudes @xmath130 derived in the cosm framework , and correspondingly we assume the simplified weak - coupling wave functions consisting of the @xmath7he(@xmath136 ) solutions and @xmath137 in the brief estimates of the cross sections",
    ".    one may refer to table ii of ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath7he(@xmath27 ) bound state wave function , while the two @xmath6 resonance states of @xmath7he have the following structures , respectively , showing the dominant components symbolically .",
    "@xmath138                  + \\sqrt{0.089-i0.013}[p_{3/2}p_{1/2 } ] , \\nonumber\\\\    ( 2^+_2 ) = \\sqrt{0.089-i0.023}[p_{3/2}^2 ]                 -\\sqrt{0.889+i0.024}[p_{3/2}p_{1/2 } ] .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here the amplitude of each cosm component is complex reflecting the calculated decay width .",
    "it is also notable that these wave functions are much different from those of the usual su(3)(@xmath139 ) prescription like @xmath140(@xmath46=1,@xmath141=0);@xmath142 and @xmath143(@xmath46=1,@xmath141=1);@xmath144 , because the @xmath145 component is smaller than @xmath146 in @xmath147 in this prescription ; the two components are almost equally admixed in conventional shell - model calculations  @xcite .",
    "the essential reason for the difference is attributed to the fact that in the cosm treatment the experimental spin - orbit splitting for the unbound @xmath148-state neutron on @xmath48 is properly taken into account through a realistic @xmath149 potential  @xcite consistent with the phase shift analysis .",
    "it should be also noted that in the present three- and four - body calculations , the same @xmath149 potential is employed . for readers reference",
    ", we remark that in cosm the @xmath150 single - channel energy is estimated to be 1.28 mev higher than the @xmath151 channel .",
    "it is also noted that the proton - pickup spectroscopic factors from the @xmath131li(@xmath152 ) leading to the @xmath7he states are calculated to be @xmath153 0.559 ( @xmath27 ) , 0.257 ( @xmath31 ) , and 0.097 ( @xmath94 ) , by neglecting the small imaginary components . if one uses the conventional shell - model wave functions with an unrealistically small spin - orbit splitting , the @xmath141-factor leading to the @xmath94 state is almost vanishing .",
    "the @xmath9he differential cross sections are estimated at @xmath154=1.5 gev and @xmath155=7 deg corresponding the e05 - 115 experimental kinematics .",
    "the calculated results are : @xmath156 here the two doublet strengths are summed up , as they are degenerate in energies . if one chooses @xmath155=2 deg , then the differential cross sections corresponding to eqs.([eq:3])-([eq:5 ] ) are estimated to be 73.8 nb / sr , 32.7 nb / sr , and 11.6 nb / sr , respectively .",
    "we remark that the relative strength for the ground state and the degenerate excited states ( 49.0nb / sr vs. 21.6 nb / sr ) is in very good agreement with the ground and second peaks observed in the jlab e05 - 115 experiment  @xcite .",
    "thus we can surely expect that the @xmath42 and @xmath43 states should appear as the third narrow peak having a differential cross section of about 40% of that for the second peak .",
    "if this peak position is identified in a future experiment , it will open an important window toward the study of characteristic structures of neutron - rich hypernuclei .    as for the excited states of @xmath7he",
    ", we note that the energy position of the second @xmath94 state is calculated to be @xmath13 mev higher , with much broader width , than the spiral experimental data  @xcite that provides the @xmath94 state energy for the first time . in view of the theory vs. experiment discrepancies in energy and width for this @xmath94 resonance state , we suggest new experiments to search for this state in @xmath7he for reconfirmation .",
    "we emphasize that such experiments to study the typical neutron - halo nuclear excited states , combined with a dedicated @xmath101he experiment , could provide a new possibility for the spectroscopy of neutron - rich hypernuclei .",
    "motivated by the recent data of @xmath1he at jlab , we calculated resonant states of @xmath42 and @xmath43 within the framework of @xmath106 four - body cluster model using csm .",
    "the resonant @xmath94 state of the core nucleus @xmath7he was calculated within the framework of @xmath10 three - body cluster model .",
    "all the two - body interactions among subunits for @xmath7he and @xmath1he are the same as in ref .",
    "@xcite , that is , the interactions are chosen to reproduce the binding energies of all subsystems composed of two and three subunits .",
    "then , we obtained that the energy of second @xmath6 state was 2.81 mev with @xmath88 mev for @xmath7he .",
    "this calculated energy is located above by @xmath13 mev and narrower than the recent data from spiral  @xcite . for @xmath1he",
    ", we predicted the energies of the second @xmath3 and @xmath4 resonant states to be 0.03 and 0.07 mev with @xmath157 mev , which have narrower widths than the corresponding state of @xmath7he core nucleus , @xmath94 , due to the gluelike role of the @xmath0 particle .    to encourage future experiments at jlab , we present brief estimates for the @xmath158he reaction cross sections by making use of the spectroscopic amplitudes derived from the cosm framework .",
    "the calculated cross sections are 3.4 nb / sr and 4.3 nb / sr for @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , if the e05 - 115 experimental kinematics is assumed .",
    "thus we predict that the first doublet peak ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) should have the strength of about @xmath159 % of the ground state peak , while the second doublet should form the third peak having about @xmath160 % which seems a feasible strength for a future experiment . for further reconfirmation",
    ", the wave functions within the four - body cluster model framework for @xmath161 and @xmath2 will be also applied to the cross section estimates and the results will be discussed in the forthcoming paper .    in conclusion we have shown the importance of measuring the third peak consisting of the @xmath121 and @xmath122 resonant states of @xmath1he together with the experimental confirmation of the second @xmath6 state energy and width of the core nucleus @xmath7he .",
    "the predicted large changes of binding energies and widths before and after the @xmath0 addition are interesting and rich aspects to be realized in neutron - rich hypernuclei .",
    "thus , we suggest that measurements should be performed to confirm the second @xmath6 resonant state of @xmath7he on one hand and , on the other hand , to find the second @xmath3 and @xmath4 doublet states in a dedicated @xmath162he experiment .",
