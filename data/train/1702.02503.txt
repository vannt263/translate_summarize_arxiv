    "in 1993 almgren , taylor and wang introduced a notion of minimizing movements suitable to describe geometric motions of interfaces driven by curvature effects ( see @xcite ) . in a nutshell",
    "it can be summarized as follows : given a fixed time step @xmath1 and an initial set @xmath2 , one constructs recursively a sequence of sets @xmath3 minimizing an energy functional of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the normal vector at the point @xmath6 in the reduced boundary @xmath7 ( we refer to @xcite for a precise definition ) and @xmath8 is a suitable surface density . the basic idea behind",
    "this approach is the following : while minimizing the surface functional shrinks the set , the bulk term forces the boundary of the minimizer to be close to the boundary of the previous set . passing to the limit as @xmath9 for the piecewise constant interpolations",
    "one obtains a time dependent family @xmath10 of sets that evolves by a weighted curvature ( depending on @xmath8 ) , provided the initial set @xmath11 is regular enough and @xmath8 is elliptic and smooth . in the isotropic case one obtains the well - known motion by mean curvature .",
    "this minimizing movement procedure was later on exported to random environments by yip in @xcite as follows : at each discrete time step , a minimizer of the energy in ( [ introminmov ] ) is computed and then this set is perturbed by a random diffeomorphism .",
    "in the recent paper @xcite braides , gelli and novaga applied the above minimizing movement scheme within a deterministic , discrete environment . in this",
    "setting the environment is the scaled two - dimensional lattice @xmath12 .",
    "the surface term in ( [ introminmov ] ) is replaced by a discrete interfacial energy which , in its simplest form , is derived from the classical nearest neighbor ising model for spin systems and can be written formally as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the spin variable . note that the energy in ( [ introinteraction ] ) takes into account only nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "therefore it coincides with the perimeter of the set @xmath15 and the relationship to the continuum model is given by identifying the spin variable with this level set .",
    "the distance - function in the bulk term in ( [ introminmov ] ) is replaced by a discrete version of the @xmath16-distance to the boundary precisely defined in ( [ distance ] ) . from a physical point of view",
    "this setup can be seen as a simplified model to describe the motion of boundaries of the level sets of the spin variables , which represent the magnetic domain walls at the discrete level .",
    "since the discrete perimeter inherits the anisotropy of the lattice , this minimizing movement scheme is related to crystalline motions , where @xmath8 is not smooth ( see @xcite in the continuum case ) .",
    "note that the continuum limit ( or @xmath17-limit ; see @xcite ) of the energies in ( [ introinteraction ] ) is given by the crystalline perimeter , that is @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the @xmath20-norm of @xmath21 ( see @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "the authors observed that the asymptotic behavior of the discrete flows depends heavily on the scaling between @xmath22 when @xmath23 simultaneously .",
    "when @xmath24 fast enough the motion is governed by the @xmath17-limit , that means one obtains the continuum motion by crystalline curvature . if , on the other hand , @xmath25 fast enough , the motions are pinned by the presence of many local minimizers in the discrete environment .",
    "this phenomenon is similar to any gradient flow that starts in a local minimum .",
    "we remark that in general such a priori results are abstract and the necessary speed of convergence / divergence might be unknown .",
    "we refer the reader to chapter 8 in @xcite for a parade of further examples on this issue",
    ". however the exact behavior was found in @xcite .",
    "the critical scaling for the discrete perimeter energies ( [ introinteraction ] ) is @xmath26 , where pinning effects due do discreteness as well as a quantized crystalline motion can occur ( see also theorem [ bgn1 ] below ) .    in this paper",
    "we start studying the effect of a random discrete environment on the continuum limit flow .",
    "we take a different approach compared to @xcite and associate the random effects directly to the lattice points . in @xcite alicandro , cicalese and",
    "the author performed a discrete - to - continuum analysis for a large class of ferromagnetic ising - type energies including ( [ introinteraction ] ) where the interacting particles are located at the points of a so - called stochastic lattice @xmath27 instead of the periodic @xmath12 ( or more generally @xmath28 ) . in particular , assuming the stochastic lattice to be stationary with respect to translations , one can prove the existence of an homogeneous limit surface energy that turns out to be deterministic under some ergodicity assumptions . in that case",
    "the continuum limit takes the form @xmath29 hence to continuum limit resembles the surface term in ( [ introminmov ] ) even though in general @xmath30 might be non - smooth .",
    "our aim is to include dynamical effects in order to describe the curvature - driven motion of magnetic domain walls .",
    "the natural approach in the spirit of @xcite would be to replace the periodic lattice in the definition of @xmath31 by a stationary random lattice @xmath27 with suitable short - range interactions .",
    "this seems to be a very challenging problem .",
    "thus we start with a much simpler model by adding very small random perturbations directly to the periodic lattice model , that means we will study the minimizing movement of a random discrete perimeter of the form @xmath32 for the precise assumptions on the random field @xmath33 we refer to section [ sec : prelim ] .",
    "note that in this scaling the random perturbations are are lower order term as they are scaled by @xmath34 .",
    "nevertheless it turns out that they may influence at least the velocity of the limit motion .",
    "the reason why we do nt let the bulk term be affected by the randomness as well , comes from the physical interpretation we give to this model as motion of aligned spins and differs from lattice particle models : while the interaction between particles may be affected by some random noise deriving from microscopic fluctuations , the energy to flip a spin should be constant , depending only on how many boundary layers are flipped in one time step .",
    "the interpretation of the bulk term in the energy in this setting is the following : flipping the first layer of spins costs the least energy while the following layers are energetically more expensive .",
    "of course this interpretation makes sense only if one can prove that in presence of randomness sets shrink by flipping spins close to the boundary by a certain number of layers .",
    "this is the case in the deterministic setting considered in @xcite .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we investigate the evolution when the initial set is a coordinate rectangle , that means a rectangle with all sides parallel to one of the coordinate axes . in theorem [ motionthm1 ]",
    "we prove that under stationarity and quantified mixing assumptions as well as a suitable uniform bound on the random field @xmath33 , the limit motion law is deterministic and coincides with the quantized crystalline flow obtained in @xcite .",
    "this however depends strongly on the fact that the random field is stationary with respect to the translation group on @xmath35 . in section [ diffstatio ]",
    "we show that the velocity changes if we restrict stationarity to a subgroup of the form @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "anyhow , we stress that our results should be seen as a stability result of the deterministic problem rather than an exhaustive description of the possible effects of randomness on the limit flow . indeed , randomness can influence the motion drastically .",
    "for example , in @xcite it is proven that when we replace the square lattice @xmath35 by a suitable isotropic stochastic lattice @xmath38 , then , up to a multiplicative constant , the discrete perimeters @xmath17-converge to the euclidean instead of the crystalline perimeter .",
    "thus , with an appropriate choice of discrete distance , one should not expect a crystalline motion anymore in the limit but rather some type of motion by mean curvature , at least if @xmath39 and the initial sets @xmath40 converge to a smooth set . to highlight possible difficulties even in the present very weak random setting ,",
    "we provide an example of stationary , ergodic perturbations that indicate strong non - uniqueness effects dropping the mixing hypothesis . in this case",
    "the functional describing the pointwise motion may not converge ( example [ nonconv ] ) so that the discrete velocity remains random , but still averaging over an increasing number of time steps one may obtain a homogenized limit velocity making further assumptions .",
    "moreover , in remark [ genericbound ] we briefly discuss what might happen when we consider random fields @xmath33 satisfying a generic @xmath41-bound .",
    "in this section we introduce our model and recall some definitions from probability theory as well as existing results in the deterministic setting .",
    "first we set some notation .",
    "given an interval @xmath42 and a function @xmath43 we set @xmath44 we set @xmath45 as the half - open coordinate square centered at @xmath6 with side length @xmath46 . for a real number @xmath47 , we let @xmath48 be its integer part and @xmath49 . by @xmath50",
    "we denote the euclidean norm on @xmath51 . if @xmath52 is a borel set we denote by @xmath53 its lebesgue measure and by @xmath54 its @xmath55-dimensional hausdorff measure .",
    "moreover , we set @xmath56 as the hausdorff metric between two sets @xmath57 .",
    "the symmetric difference of two sets @xmath57 is denoted by @xmath58 .",
    "we set @xmath59 as the characteristic function of @xmath60 , and we denote by @xmath61 $ ] the first moment of a random variable @xmath62 .",
    "we now specify the framework for our model .",
    "let @xmath63 be a complete probability space . as pointed out in the introduction , we consider the easiest type of normalized ferromagnetic energies accounting only for nearest neighbor interactions . given @xmath64 and a function @xmath14 we set @xmath65 where the @xmath66 are uniformly bounded random variables satisfying a suitable @xmath0-mixing assumption specified in ( [ mixingdecay ] ) .",
    "note that without loss of generality we may assume that @xmath67 for all @xmath68 .",
    "we define @xmath69 this class @xmath70 is closed under unions and intersections .",
    "identifying a function @xmath71 with the set @xmath72 given by @xmath73 we can interpret @xmath74 as a random perimeter defined on @xmath70 via @xmath75 .",
    "+ if @xmath76 denotes the dual lattice of @xmath35 , we can rewrite the random perimeter as a sum over points on the boundary @xmath77 via @xmath78 where with a slight abuse of notation we set @xmath79 . from now on we assume the random variables to be indexed by the dual lattice .",
    "given @xmath80 it will be useful to define the properly scaled random perimeter also on portions of the boundary @xmath81 setting @xmath82 with this notion , it holds that @xmath83 .    in order to adapt the idea of almgren , taylor and wang for studying curvature - driven motions",
    ", we have to define a suitable discrete distance between sets . as in @xcite",
    "we take a discrete version of the @xmath84-distance . to this end",
    ", first note that for every @xmath85 there exists a unique point @xmath86 such that @xmath87 . given a set @xmath88",
    "we define the value of the measurable function @xmath89 at @xmath87 by @xmath90 observe that by definition @xmath91 .",
    "now we can define the total energy to be considered in the minimizing movement scheme .",
    "given a mesh size @xmath92 , a time step @xmath1 , sets @xmath93 and @xmath64 we set @xmath94 for a fixed ( possibly random ) initial set @xmath95 , we introduce the following discrete - in - time minimization scheme :    1 .",
    "@xmath96 2 .",
    "@xmath97 minimizes @xmath98 .",
    "note that this procedure might not be unique .",
    "the discrete flat flow is defined as the piecewise constant interpolation @xmath99 as a by - product of the analysis performed in @xcite , the most interesting regime is @xmath100 .",
    "hence we assume for simplicity that @xmath101 and omit the dependence on @xmath102 in the notation introduced above . for a complete analysis",
    "we have to require that the coefficient field satisfies the bound @xmath103 we remark that some of the results in this paper are valid for a generic @xmath41-bound but unfortunately these are not enough to characterize the motion .    using the boundedness of the random coefficients",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath104 has the same @xmath17-limit in the @xmath105-topology as @xmath31 defined in ( [ introinteraction ] ) , so that it converges to the crystalline perimeter ( [ crystalline ] ) .",

    "more precisely , we require that the random field is @xmath0-mixing with @xmath139 there are stronger notions of mixing in the literature , however we prefer to chose @xmath0-mixing with a certain decay rate of @xmath140 rather than some @xmath141-mixing condition since the generalization of @xmath141-mixing conditions to two - dimensional random fields is not trivial and many of them already imply a finite range dependence assumption ( see @xcite ) .",

    "it is the aim of this paper to extend these results to small random perturbations of the perimeter . while in @xcite",
    "more general classes of sets are studied , we restrict ourselves to rectangles as the analysis of these sets already contains the main features deriving from randomness .",
    "we mention that some effects of periodic perturbations have already been studied in @xcite . in @xcite",

    "it is shown that minimizers avoid the @xmath176-interactions and thus the limit velocity does not depend on @xmath176 but only on the geometric proportions @xmath177 of the periodicity cell .",
    "it would be interesting to see how random interactions acting on this scale influence the minimizing sets , since without periodicity it might be impossible to take only @xmath178-interactions .",
    "however , in this paper we take the same scaling as the periodic perturbations considered in @xcite .",
    "these are so called low - contrast perturbations since they vanish when @xmath162 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the right scaling to obtain also @xmath176-interactions is @xmath179 .",
    "more precisely , one has to require that @xmath180 .",
    "note that this bound agrees with ( [ pertubationsize ] ) .",
    "hence with @xmath181 this model corresponds to a deterministic version of ( [ ondual ] ) . in this sense , up to the bound ( [ pertubationsize ] ) , our theorem [ mainmstatio ] generalizes the results of @xcite to the most general periodic interactions as well as to the random case . while in the above deterministic setting coefficients with @xmath182 lead to rectangular interfaces using only @xmath178-interactions , in the random case it is not clear what happens .",
    "we leave this issue as well as the high - contrast case open for future studies . for the interested reader",
    "we mention the recent papers @xcite , where the minimizing movements have been studied for other discrete surface - type models .",
    "in the sequel we study the case , when the initial data @xmath145 is a coordinate rectangle .",
    "we further assume for the rest of this paper that @xmath183 this bound implies that any sequence chosen by the minimizing movement has equibounded perimeter .",

    "the argument splits into two steps .",
    "first we prove that any minimizer must be connected and second , using ( [ pertubationsize ] ) , we conclude that this component has to be a coordinate rectangle . the idea to prove connectedness is as follows :",
    "first we compare the energy with a fast flow of a deterministic functional to conclude that the minimizer must contain a very large rectangle .",

    "let @xmath187 and suppose @xmath188 is a coordinate rectangle which has all side lengths greater than @xmath189 .",
    "then , for @xmath34 small enough , @xmath190 is again a coordinate rectangle contained in @xmath188 .",
    "as explained above we divide the proof into two steps . as the arguments are purely deterministic we drop the @xmath191-dependence of the sets .",

    "setting @xmath561 , we will see that the motion of the corresponding left vertical side will be given locally by the following algorithm : + for @xmath562 set          observe that the quotient space @xmath573 has only @xmath492 distinct elements so that the first statement holds .",
    "for the second statement we first establish a monotonicity property of the orbits with respect to the initial data @xmath572 .",
    "to this end let @xmath574 .",
    "we argue inductively .",
    "due to ( [ just3 ] ) it is clear that @xmath575 in case that @xmath576 or @xmath577 .",
    "it remains the case where @xmath578 .",
    "we assume by contradiction that @xmath579 .",
    "writing @xmath550 , the minimizer to determine @xmath580 would be given by @xmath581 while for @xmath582 minimizing yields @xmath583 .",
    "using minimality one easily derives that in this case we have @xmath584 where @xmath585 .",
    "this gives a contradiction .",
    "by iteration we obtain that @xmath586 for all @xmath404 .",
    "now we argue as in proposition 3.6 in @xcite by comparing the long - time behavior of the orbits with starting points @xmath587 and @xmath588 .",
    "for @xmath589 we let @xmath590 . by the first part of the proof and orbit monotonicity , for @xmath591 large enough it holds that @xmath592 dividing this inequality by @xmath546 and letting @xmath593 yields the claim .    for a given type of side with length @xmath594 , let @xmath595 be as in lemma [ homogenvelocity ] , where @xmath596 is chosen to be minimal .",
    "the effective velocity for a side @xmath149 is defined as a function @xmath597 by @xmath598 in view of lemma [ homogenvelocity ] , this function is well - defined .",
    "in contrast to the deterministic environments considered in @xcite in our setting the effective velocity of two opposite sides can be different . however this is not due to random effects but can already be caused by a slightly more complex periodic structure as shown in the following example .",
    "this follows from a straightforward computation based on the minimality criteria ( [ charmin ] ) . indeed ,",
    "if the left side starts at @xmath603 , then we have @xmath604 .",
    "if the right side starts also at @xmath603 we deduce that @xmath605 .",
    "we leave the details of the computation to the interested reader .",
    "let us now compute the pinning threshold , that is the critical side length above which a side does not move after a finite number of time steps ( or equivalently @xmath606 ) .",
    "due to ( [ just3 ] ) a necessary condition is given by @xmath607 .",
    "we then have to compare the values of @xmath608 . for an arbitrary starting position of a left vertical side we obtain the conditions",
    "@xmath609 as we can chose the index @xmath404 , the pinning threshold for a left vertical side is given by @xmath610 the pinning thresholds for the other sides are given by @xmath611 where the indices rotate clockwise . the next lemma contains some properties of the effective velocities .",
    "we remark that the same results have been obtain in @xcite but we find it difficult to reproduce the argument in our slightly more complex setting . therefore we provide a different proof .        to prove the first assertion , fix an interval @xmath616 and let @xmath617 .",
    "we claim that there exists an open interval @xmath618 around @xmath546 such that for all @xmath619 and all @xmath620 the unique minimizers of @xmath621 agree with the unique minimizer of @xmath566 .",
    "as @xmath42 is connected , it then follows that the minimizers are the same for all @xmath622 and we conclude by iteration . to prove the claim , it is enough to observe that whenever @xmath623 , it follows that @xmath624 pointwise . due to ( [ just3 ] ) also the minimizers are bounded . by uniqueness",
    "they converge to the minimizer of the limit function .      to prove the monotonicity , take @xmath625 .",
    "the claim follows from the fact that , for every @xmath619 , in a multi - valued sense it holds that @xmath626 indeed , observe that @xmath627 .",
    "then by ( [ just3 ] ) it suffices to treat the two cases @xmath628 and @xmath629 . in any case , again applying ( [ just3 ] ) there are only finitely many options for violating ( [ velmonotonicity ] ) that can be ruled out by a direct calculation based on a characterization as in ( [ charmin ] ) .",
    "we omit the details .",
    "[ mainmstatio ] assume that the random field @xmath186 satisfies ( [ pertubationsize ] ) , is @xmath492-stationary and @xmath0-mixing such that ( [ mixingdecay ] ) holds . then with probability @xmath55 the following holds :",
    "let @xmath312 and let @xmath407 be a coordinate rectangle with sides @xmath408 .",
    "assume that @xmath409 converges in the hausdorff metric to a coordinate rectangle @xmath410 .",
    "then we can choose a subsequence ( not relabeled ) , such that @xmath411 converges locally in time to @xmath412 , where @xmath412 is a coordinate rectangle with sides @xmath413 such that @xmath414 .",
    "each side @xmath413 moves inward with velocity @xmath415 solving the following inclusions : @xmath630 & \\mbox{otherwise , }      \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath417 denotes the length of the side @xmath413 .",
    "the inclusions are valid until the extinction time when @xmath418 .    due to remark [ compactness ]",
    "we only have to derive the formula for the velocities .",
    "we fix @xmath315 given by proposition [ convergencem ] . using the same notation as in the proof of theorem [ motionthm1 ] , we have to identify the weak*-limit @xmath631 of @xmath632 on the interval @xmath633 .",
    "therefore we fix @xmath634 such that @xmath635 .",
    "given @xmath131 there exists an open interval @xmath636 and @xmath518 such that for all @xmath340      hence , by proposition [ convergencem ] we may assume that for @xmath340 and @xmath639 there exists @xmath640 such that for @xmath641 @xmath642 where @xmath566 is defined in ( [ limitvelocitym ] ) .",
    "since without loss of generality @xmath425 is in the same interval contained in @xmath613 as @xmath643 , we infer from the lemmata [ homogenvelocity ] and [ properties ] ( a ) that @xmath644 dividing by @xmath645 and letting @xmath646 we obtain the claim using lebesgue s differentiation theorem . note that similar to the proof of theorem [ motionthm1 ] the formula for the velocity holds for every such @xmath647 since @xmath631 has a constant representative locally near @xmath647 so that the side positions are differentiable in the classical sense .",
    "however here we have to take the side positions and can not deduce the velocity from the side lengths since the center might move ( see example [ centermoves ] ) .",
    "it remains the case where @xmath648 .",
    "note that by ( [ velmonotonicity ] ) we still have the monotonicity of orbits .",
    "that means if @xmath649 are in the two intervals enclosing @xmath650 such that @xmath651 and we start the algorithm for computing the effective velocity with the same initial datum choosing the minimizer arbitrarily in the case of non - uniqueness , we have @xmath652 this yields @xmath653 the claim follows after dividing by @xmath645 , sending @xmath646 and then taking both the limits as @xmath654 and @xmath655 for which we use monotonicity .",
    "again we have several cases where a unique limit motion exists .",
    "however the equations differ since the velocity of two opposite sides may be not equal .",
    "we do nt list all possible cases where there is a unique motion .",
    "let @xmath95 and @xmath186 be as in theorem [ mainmstatio ] .",
    "assume in addition that the lengths @xmath466 of @xmath410 satisfy one of the three following conditions ( we assume that @xmath656 and @xmath657 as well as @xmath658 ) :      then with probability @xmath55 the following holds : let @xmath473 .",
    "the sequence @xmath411 converges locally in time to @xmath412 , where @xmath412 is the unique coordinate rectangle with sides @xmath413 such that @xmath414 and the side lengths @xmath442 solve the following differential equations for all but countably many times : @xmath665 with initial condition @xmath479 and @xmath168 .",
    "\\(i ) and ( ii ) can be proven as in theorem 3.2 in @xcite . in case ( iii )",
    "note that the side @xmath666 moves inward with a strictly positive velocity bounded away from @xmath331 . hence @xmath477 is strictly decreasing until it vanishes .",
    "consequently @xmath667 only for countably many times .",
    "moreover , as soon as @xmath668 also the side length @xmath476 shrinks strictly since from that time on the side @xmath669 moves inward with positive velocity . hence the times when @xmath670 are discrete , too . note that by continuity , the values at the critical times are uniquely defined . in between these critical times , one can use general results from ode - theory to obtain that the rectangular motion is unique .",
    "the particular form of the ode describing the motion is a straightforward consequence of theorem [ mainmstatio ] .      in this last section",
    "we show that , under certain assumptions , the random field considered in example [ nonconv ] exhibits an averaged velocity as well .",
    "we do nt aim at giving results in full detail since example [ nonconv ] only serves as a toy model and the case of only stationary perturbations seems much more involved and we are not sure if homogenization can be proved .    to be precise we give a hint how to generalize lemma [ homogenvelocity ] in a probabilistic way .",
    "note that by construction of the perturbations in example [ nonconv ] there is nothing left to prove for horizontal sides since we may apply proposition [ allconvergence ] . for vertical sides",
    "we first indicate some possible uniqueness issues . for the moment",
    "let us neglect the error terms in ( [ errors ] ) . denoting by @xmath671 the @xmath6-component of @xmath672 , for left vertical sides we have to minimize @xmath673",
    "let us take a closer look at the non - uniqueness of minimizers .",
    "again we set @xmath674 and @xmath675 .",
    "writing @xmath676 , as in ( [ charmin ] ) we deduce that minimizers are not unique if @xmath677      let @xmath678 be uniformly distributed on the interval @xmath679 .",
    "then , by independence , for every @xmath404 the random variable @xmath680 has a triangular distribution on @xmath681 .",
    "hence the sequence @xmath682 is an independent and identically distributed sequence of random variables .",
    "then @xmath683 indeed , given @xmath684 and @xmath527 , from independence we infer @xmath685    this example indicates that a precise analysis for the limit velocity is quite difficult ( of course one has to take into account also the error terms ( [ errors ] ) ) . instead , if we assume that @xmath678 takes only finitely many values , then the set of side lengths @xmath686 where the minimization problem has not a unique solution is again discrete .",
    "we now give a formal argument how one can treat this case . for side lengths with unique corresponding minimizers ,",
    "we can indeed neglect ( [ errors ] ) .",
    "moreover , by the same topological argument used in the proof of lemma [ properties ] , the minimization does not depend on the particular side length in one interval contained in @xmath687 .",
    "however , in contrast to the mixing case , the choice of minimizers is still random .",
    "given @xmath688 we have to consider the following ( now random ) algorithm : given a starting point @xmath689 , + for @xmath562 set      note that if @xmath546 is below the corresponding pinning threshold ( which can easily be estimated since the random variables take only finitely many values ) , then the sequence @xmath693 is identically distributed and has a finite range dependence .",
    "therefore , by the strong law of large numbers , almost surely we have      note that the limit does not depend on @xmath498 .",
    "moreover , as a trivial remark we can make the exceptional set independent of the starting position @xmath498 . in order to prove that @xmath695 $ ] is , up to a multiplicative constant , the velocity of the left vertical side , we need to control the speed of convergence independently of @xmath498 . this can be achieved by defining finitely many stochastic processes ( for a fixed limit side ) similar to the proof of proposition [ convergencem ] using the fast decay of error probabilities due to finite range dependence .",
    "since we only want to give a possible outlook we do nt go into details here .",
    "finally one can argue as in the proof of theorem [ mainmstatio ] and pass to the limit in the integral in ( [ passlimit ] ) .",
    "we leave the computation to the interested reader ."
