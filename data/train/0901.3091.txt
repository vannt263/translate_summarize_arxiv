    "ultracold fermi gases have been in the last years at the forefront of research both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "indeed homonuclear mixtures of fermionic atoms in two different hyperfine ( pseudo - spin ) states offer the unprecedented advantage of a continuous tuning of the interspecies attractive interaction .",
    "thanks to this unique feature recent experiments have spectacularly demonstrated high - temperature superfluidity of attractive fermions @xcite for a large interval of values of the scattering length , spanning for the first time the crossover from bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) pairing to the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of bosonic molecules composed of two fermions ( bcs - bec crossover ) @xcite .",
    "the fate of the fermionic superfluid upon imbalancing the two spin species has been monitored in elongated traps , showing that conventional pairing accompanied by segregation of the excess majority atoms persists over a large interval of imbalance values @xcite .",
    "this finding stands in contrast to the expectation for one - dimensional systems , where exotic pairing with finite - momentum pairs of fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) type @xcite is predicted to occur @xcite .",
    "in addition , ultracold heteronuclear fermionic mixtures @xcite with controllable interactions have been very recently realized , as well bose - fermi mixtures in which the attractive interaction can create a fermi gas of polar molecules @xcite .",
    "one of the major difficulties confronted by recent experiments is the problem of faithful detection of correlations in the strongly correlated regime of the gas . for attractive fermionic gases , the best - developed probe for phase correlations to date",
    "is represented by the dynamical projection of fermionic pairs onto deeply bound molecules and the destructive time - of - flight measurement of the latter @xcite . in the limit of deeply bound molecules , noise correlation analysis",
    "@xcite has been used as well to detect pairing correlations @xcite .",
    "the other crucial probes used in experiments are phase - contrast imaging @xcite which reveals only the local correlations between the two species ; imaging of the vortex lattice induced by stirring , which reveals macroscopic phase coherence @xcite ; and radio - frequency spectroscopy @xcite , which probes the binding energy of the fermion pairs .",
    "in this paper we focus on the fundamental insight that can be gained by shining polarized light onto the atoms and detecting the quantum fluctuations imprinted onto the light polarization by the atomic sample ( quantum polarization spectroscopy , qps ) @xcite .",
    "this non - destructive measurement gives direct access to _ spin - spin _ correlations in the atomic system @xcite .",
    "when the light shone on the atomic sample is a standing wave @xcite , this type of measurement allows to directly probe the magnetic structure factor at the wavevector corresponding to the standing - wave period .",
    "here we focus on the case of trapped attractive fermions , and we show that the measurement of the fluctuations of the light quadratures  which gives the information on spatially resolved spin correlations and fluctuations  is very sensitive to various aspects of the paired phases occurring in this system . in the case of a balanced fermi gas undergoing a crossover from the bcs regime to the bec regime , we show that the evolution of spin - spin fluctuations at a given wavevector exhibits directly the shrinking of the size of the pairs upon varying the scattering length . in the case of a one - dimensional imbalanced fermi gas in an optical lattice , we show that fflo pairing leaves an unambiguous fingerprint on spin - spin correlations .",
    "this signature enjoys the full robustness of the fflo phase in 1d @xcite , and it persists also in presence of a parabolic trapping potential .",

    "conclusions are discussed in section [ sec:5 ] . before proceeding further ,",
    "let us stress that the method we propose here to unveal spin - spin correlations in ultracold atomic gases is not restricted to atomic samples .",
    "it could be extended , e.g. , to study the spin physics of fermionic molecules created in bose - fermi mixtures .",
    "fermionic molecules might posses very large electric dipole moments which modifies substantially the properties of the strongly interacting regime with respect to the case of short - range interactions .",

    "a closer inspection into density correlations shows that , due to the attractive interactions , each bound pair is actually surrounded by a weak cloud of excess @xmath158 atoms , and viceversa the density - density correlations of @xmath175 atoms shows a weak modulation at the fermi wavevector of the @xmath158 ones . yet these aspects turn out to be irrelevant for the dominant behavior of spin - spin correlations .",
