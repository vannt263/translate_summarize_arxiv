    "[ intro ] multiferroics ( mfs ) are compounds where long - range magnetic and dipolar orders coexist@xcite .",
    "there is plenty of fascinating physics in these materials , due to the strong entanglement of spin - charge - orbital degrees of freedom@xcite and a great potential for technological applications has already been recognized@xcite .",
    "the coupling between magnetism and ferroelectricity can be used for sensing applications , but also for memory devices where data is typically stored as magnetic information and read out electrically . recently , several manganese and iron oxides have been shown to possess strong coupling ; however , ferroelectricity in these materials is rather weak and only the electrical polarization can be switched by a magnetic field ( but not viceversa , a limitation for many applications ) . within this framework ,",
    "dyfeo@xmath1 is a very interesting compound@xcite because it shows large ferroelectric polarization combined with a strong magnetoelectric coupling .",
    "furthermore , the ferroelectric polarization in dyfeo@xmath1 is induced by the peculiar magnetic structure , obtained upon applying an external magnetic field .",
    "dyfeo@xmath1 belongs to the the class of perovkite oxides , such as rmo@xmath1 ( where r is a rare - earth ion and m is a transition metal atom ) . from the computational point of view , their description poses serious problems . these compounds are often ( strongly ) correlated materials , involving @xmath6 and @xmath7 electronic charge with significant spatial localization .",
    "first - principles density functional theory ( dft ) calculations in the most commonly applied local density approximation ( lda ) or generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) have to face well known deficiencies : the non - locality of the screened exchange interaction is not well taken into account and the electrostatic self - interaction is not entirely compensated@xcite .",
    "since semilocal functionals tend to delocalize @xmath4-states , the @xmath4-electrons are often kept `` frozen '' in the core , and the origin of multiferroicity is generally attributed to the spin - charge - orbital degrees of freedom of the m sublattice .",
    "although this `` standard '' approach helped in clarifying many mechanisms leading to ferroelectricity in mfs@xcite , the influence of @xmath4 electrons on multiferroicity has not been extensively investigated yet by _ ab ",
    "initio _ calculations , despite several experiments clearly point out @xmath4-electrons to play an important role in mf properties of rmo@xmath1 compounds@xcite .",
    "this is especially so for dyfeo@xmath1 , where the electric polarization appears at a very low temperature , corresponding to ordering of dy spins@xcite .",

    "i.e. _ a @xmath9 configuration@xcite .    in this study , stimulated by the recent experimental demonstration of a magnetic - field - induced ferroelectric ( fe ) phase of dyfeo@xmath1 ( dfo)@xcite , we performed ab - initio simulations in order to show the key role played by @xmath4 electrons in stabilizing spin - driven ferroelectricity .",
    "our calculations support the experimental study of ref .   and , at the same time , quantify the polarization and shed light on the microscopic mechanism ( _ i.e. _ based on electronic structure analysis ) of the origin of ferroelectricity . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first _ ab  initio _ study of the above - mentioned effect .",
    "our simulations were mainly carried out within a dft+@xmath5 approach for localized electrons .",

    ", a polarization @xmath18 along the @xmath12 axis should be generated . in the fe@xmath11 state ,",
    "the flip of dy spins would cause a reversal of @xmath18 .",
    "finally , in the pe state , each fe sheet is sandwiched by layers with @xmath31 dy spins , and no interlayer dimerization is expected .",
    "this microscopic mechanism , which involves frustrated interactions between rare earth and transition metal ions and its optimization by exchange striction , was proposed in refs .  .",
    "our calculations confirm the above interpretation .",
    "first of all , the total energies of fe@xmath24 and fe@xmath11 are degenerate .",
    "furthermore , from the symmetry point - of - view , the rotation of dy spins from pe to fe@xmath24 or to fe@xmath11 causes a symmetry lowering from the non - polar space group 62 ( d@xmath32 ) to a polar space group 33 ( c@xmath33 ) , giving rise to a polarization along the @xmath12 axis .",
    "indeed , the distortions lead to an alternate short - long - short - long interlayer distance , with @xmath34 1.898     and @xmath35 1.910   , while @xmath36 = 1.904    in the unrelaxed non - spin polarized case 1.899    and @xmath37=1.909   , whereas hse gives : @xmath34 1.899   and @xmath351.910  . ] . clearly , the dy-_@xmath4 electrons play a key role _ in stabilizing the fe state . in order to prove this",
    ", we froze the @xmath4 electrons in the core and we calculated the electronic ground state using the previously relaxed fe@xmath24 structure .",
    "first , the electronic contribution to the polarization , @xmath38 vanishes ; then , by allowing the ions to relax , the ionic contribution , @xmath39 , becomes negligible as well , and the final crystal structure is non - polar . in summary ,",
    "when treating the @xmath4 electrons as valence states , the pe state becomes unstable , the d@xmath32 point group symmetry is spontaneously broken to c@xmath33 and the system evolves towards a stable and polar state .",

    "to shed light on the onset of ferroelectricity , we construct an adiabatic path by progressively rotating the dy spins from 90 to 0 degree , _ i.e. _ from the pe to fe@xmath24 state .",
    "the results are summarized in figure  [ path ] : panel ( i ) shows the energy difference between the fe@xmath24 and the pe phases , evaluated at the ideal centrosymmetric ( cs ) ionic structure ( in blue ) and relaxed configuration ( in red ) ; in ( ii ) , ( iii ) , ( iv ) we show the electronic , ionic and total fe polarization , respectively , evaluated at the ideal ( blue ) and relaxed ( red ) ionic structure ; in ( iv ) the point - charge - model ( pcm ) estimate of the polarization is also reported ( in black ) ; in ( v ) the change in the interlayer distances along the path ( see also fig .",
    "[ dfo ] ) is shown .",
    "panel ( i ) clearly shows that ferroelectricity in dfo is magnetically induced .",
    "in fact , already for the cs structure , the spin rotations give rise to an energy gain ( blue bars ) , further enhanced by ionic relaxations ( red bars ) .",
    "note that the relaxation of the electronic degrees of freedoms accounts for most of the total stabilization energy ( cfr blue and red bars ) .",
    "the energy gain increases from left to right in panel ( i ) , _ i.e. _ towards a collinear configuration . in parallel , @xmath38 also increases from left to right , even in the ideal cs structure ( blue ) , as expected for magnetically induced mfs@xcite ; ionic relaxations further increase @xmath38 [ see panel ( ii ) ] . from panel",
    "( iii ) , we see that @xmath43 is opposite to @xmath38 and of the same order of magnitude",
    ". however , @xmath43 does _ not _ fully compensate @xmath38 [ see panel ( iv ) ] , giving rise to a total polarization @xmath44 of @xmath45 0.20 @xmath41c@xmath42 for collinear spins .",
    "the inclusion of soc confirms @xmath44 , _",
    "i.e. _ 0.18 @xmath41c@xmath42 .",
    "notably , this value is in good agreement with the estimate given in ref .",
    "hse also confirms the value of fe polarization .",
    "furthermore , note that @xmath46 is not only opposite to @xmath44 , but also smaller in absolute value than @xmath44 .",
    "this confirms that electronic degrees of freedom trigger the fe transition .",

    "when the symmetry is lowered to c@xmath33 , dy and o@xmath14 change their site symmetry to @xmath49 and the o@xmath13 become _ inequivalent _ ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "this is readily explained by considering the local spin configuration around o@xmath13s : when the latter are sandwiched by fm coupled fe and dy layers , they have two @xmath28fe and two @xmath28dy atoms as nearest neighbors ( these will be labelled o@xmath53 ) ; when sandwiched by fe and dy layers afm coupled , they have two @xmath28fe and two @xmath27dy atoms as nearest neighbors ( labelled as o@xmath54 ) .",

    ", we impose the pe spin configuration on top of the cs ionic structure . in this case , all o@xmath13s carry induced spin moments of exactly the same magnitude . in passing",
    ", we note that all oxygens remain equivalent when freezing the dy-@xmath4 electrons in the core .",
    "furthermore , we performed an analysis of the symmetry breaking distortions@xcite .",

    "the inequivalency of o@xmath13 is subtle : o@xmath53 ( o@xmath54 ) move in such a way to _ decrease _ ( _ increase _ ) the distance to its neighbor dy atom .",
    "for o@xmath53 , d@xmath58 is 2.478  ; for o@xmath54 , d@xmath58 is 2.496   ( the same distance in the pe phase is 2.487  ) , suggesting that a weak bonding interaction is active between the fm layers , leading to a polarization along @xmath12 .",
    "a useful tool for studying tiny differences in bonding interaction in solid state systems is the electron localization function ( elf)@xcite . the elf values lie by definition between zero and one .",
    "values are close to 1 , if in the vicinity of one electron no other electron with the same spin may be found , for instance as occurs in _ bonding pairs_. here , we consider the _ difference _ in elf ( delf ) between the situation when @xmath4 electrons are in the valence and when they are frozen in the core , for the same ionic configuration , _",
    "i.e. _ delf(@xmath47)=elf@xmath59(@xmath47)-elf@xmath60(@xmath47 ) .",
    "the physical interpretation is as follows : positive values of delf show up in regions where the electron localization is higher , _",

    "clearly , it is mainly localized between fm layers and , more specifically , in the region between dy and o@xmath53 .",
    "this points to a bonding interaction between fm layers mediated by o@xmath53 .",
    "a careful inspection of the orbital - decomposed magnetic moments reveals that the dy-@xmath61 states are polarized _ only _ if the @xmath0 states are in the valence : the @xmath0 states couple locally to the @xmath61 spin moments by intra - atomic @xmath0-@xmath61 exchange interaction@xcite .",
    "the @xmath61 states are much more extended than @xmath0 electrons , suggesting that the glue that finally couples fm fe and dy layers is the interatomic interaction between the fe @xmath62 states and the dy @xmath61 states mediated by the oxygen @xmath63 states . in fig .",
