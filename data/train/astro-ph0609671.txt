    "cataclysmic variable stars ( cvs ) are compact , interacting binary systems in which a white dwarf primary accretes from a low - mass , roughly main - sequence donor star . the mass transfer and secular evolution of cvs",
    "is driven by angular momentum losses . in systems with long orbital periods ( @xmath10  hrs ) ,",
    "the dominant angular momentum loss mechanism is thought to be magnetic braking ( mb ) due to a stellar wind from the donor star . in the canonical `` disrupted magnetic braking '' evolution scenario for cvs ,",
    "mb stops when the secondary becomes fully convective , at @xmath11  hrs . at this point",
    ", the donor detaches from the roche lobe , and gravitational radiation ( gr ) becomes the only remaining angular momentum loss mechanism .",
    "the gr - driven shrinkage of the orbit ultimately brings the secondary back into contact at @xmath12  hrs , at which point mass transfer resumes .",
    "the motivation for this scenario is the dearth of mass - transferring cvs in the so - called period gap between @xmath13  hrs and @xmath14  hrs .",
    "as a cv evolves , its donor star is continuously losing mass .",
    "as long as the mass - loss time scale ( @xmath15 ) is much longer than the donor s thermal time scale ( @xmath16 ) , the secondary is able to maintain thermal equilibrium and should closely follow the standard main sequence track defined by single stars . here and throughout , we use @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 to denote a donor s mass , radius and luminosity , and @xmath20 to denote the rate at which it is losing mass to the primary .",
    "if the condition @xmath21 is not met , the donor will be driven out of thermal equilibrium and become oversized compared to an isolated main sequence ( ms ) star of identical mass .",
    "so how do thermal and mass - loss time scales compare for the donor stars in cvs ? or , to put it another way , are the donors main sequence stars ?",
    "this question has been addressed twice in recent years , in very different ways .",
    "first , beuermann et al .",
    "( 1998 ; hereafter b98 ) showed that , at least for periods @xmath22  hrs ( i.e. above the period gap ) , the spectral types ( @xmath6s ) of cv donor stars are significantly later than those of isolated ms stars . at the very longest periods ( @xmath23  hrs ) , this is probably due to the donors being somewhat evolved ( b98 ; also see podsiadlowski , han & rappaport 2003 ) . however , for all other systems , the late @xmath6s of the donors are simply a sign of their losing battle to maintain thermal equilibrium .",
    "second , patterson et al .",
    "( 2005 ; hereafter p05 ) produced an empirical mass - radius sequence for cv donors based on a sample of masses and radii derived mainly from superhumping cvs .",
    "one of their key results was that cv donors are indeed oversized compared to ms stars , for all periods @xmath24  hrs .",
    "they also detected a clear discontinuity in @xmath18 for systems with similar @xmath17 above and below the period gap .",
    "this is just what is expected in the disrupted magnetic braking picture : the mb - driven systems just above the gap should be losing mass faster than than the gr - driven systems just below .",
    "they should therefore be further out of thermal equilibrium .    in the present paper",
    ", we will build on these important studies by constructing a complete , semi - empirical donor sequence for cvs . more specifically ,",
    "our goal is to derive a benchmark evolution track for cv secondaries that incorporates all of the best existing observational and theoretical constraints on the global donor properties .",
    ", @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath25 , @xmath6 ) and photometric ( absolute magnitudes in ubvrijhklm ) donor properties are fully specified along the entire evolutionary track . ] along the way , we will update both of the earlier studies and show that they are mutually consistent : the mass - radius relation obtained by p05 is just what is needed to account for the late @xmath6s observed by b98 .",
    "our donor sequence should be useful for many practical applications .",
    "perhaps most fundamentally , it provides a benchmark for what we mean by a `` normal '' cv and can thus be used to test cv evolution scenarios that predict the properties of cv donors .",
    "the sequence can also be used to simplify and improve on `` bailey s method '' for estimating the distances to cvs ( bailey 1981 ) .",
    "the new version of the method requires only knowledge of the orbital period and an infrared magnitude measurement .",
    "conversely , for systems with known distances , the sequence can be used to estimate the donor contribution to the system s flux in any desired bandpass . finally , the present work is also a stepping stone towards another goal : the construction of new , semi - empirical mass - transfer rate and angular momentum loss laws for cvs .",
    "this should be possible , since the degree of departure of a donor from the ms track is a direct measure of the mass loss from it and hence of the angular momentum loss that drives @xmath20 .",
    "given the importance of the @xmath26 relation to the present work , we begin by revisiting and updating p05 s @xmath17-@xmath18 relation for cv donor stars .",
    "we still use the same fundamental data as p05 , but carry out a fully independent analysis to derive our own mass - radius relation from the data . in the following sections , we will briefly discuss each of the key steps in the derivation ( and also introduce some new ideas of our own ) .",
    "however , we start with an outline of the overall framework of the method , i.e. the way in which a mass - radius relation for cv secondaries can be derived from ( mainly ) observations of superhumps .",
    "superhumps are a manifestation of a donor - induced accretion disk eccentricity that is observed primarily in erupting dwarf novae , but also in some non - magnetic nova - like cvs and even in a few lmxbs .",
    "once established , the eccentricity precesses on a time scale that is much longer than the orbital period .",
    "the superhump signal is then observed at the beat period between the orbital and precession periods .",
    "the superhump period , @xmath27 , is therefore typically a few percent longer than the orbital period , and the superhump excess , @xmath28 , is defined as @xmath29    both theory and observation agree that @xmath28 is a function of the mass ratio , @xmath30 .",
    "this @xmath31 relation can be calibrated by considering eclipsing superhumpers for which an independent mass ratio estimate is available .",
    "given such a calibration , we can estimate @xmath32 for any superhumper with measured @xmath28 .",
    "two additional steps are needed to turn an estimate of the mass ratio into an estimate of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "first , in order to obtain @xmath17 from @xmath32 , we clearly first need an estimate of @xmath33 . for a few systems ( mostly eclipsers ) , this can be measured directly . however , for most other systems , a representative value has to be assumed .",
    "for example , p05 used @xmath34 for all systems without a direct estimate , based on several estimates of the mean wd mass in cvs in the literature . with this assumption ,",
    "the mass of the donor is then simply given by @xmath35    the second additional step is to make use of the fact that the secondary is filling its roche lobe .",
    "the donor must therefore obey the well - known period - density relation for roche - lobe filling objects ( warner 1995 , equation 2.3b ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the orbital period in units of hours and @xmath38 equation  [ dense ] is accurate to better than 3% over the interval @xmath39 . since @xmath17 and @xmath1 are known at this point , the period - density relation can be recast to yield an estimate of the donor radius @xmath40 or , equivalently , @xmath41 at this point , both @xmath17 and @xmath18 have been estimated . a fit to the resulting set of @xmath17 and @xmath18 pairs ( supplemented with additional data points derived from from eclipsing systems ) can then be used to determine the functional form of the mass - radius relation for cv donors .    in the following sections",
    ", we will take a closer look at all of the key steps we have outlined , and also add one final step of our own . more specifically , we will consider ( i ) the calibration of the @xmath31 relation for superhumpers ; ( ii ) the assumption of a single @xmath33 value for most cvs ; ( iii ) the external constraints that the final mass - radius relation should reproduce the observed locations of the period gap and the minimum period ; ( iv ) the derivation of an optimal fit to the @xmath17-@xmath18 pairs , allowing for correlated errors , intrinsic dispersion and external constraints .",
    "table  7 in p05 provides a list of calibrators for the @xmath31 relation .",
    "this contains 10 superhumping and eclipsing cvs with independent mass ratio constraints , one superhumping cv with a large superhump excess and an _ assumed _ upper limit on @xmath32 ( bb dor ) , and also one superhumping and eclipsing lmxb with a very low mass ratio ( kv uma ) . in devising our own , independent calibration of the @xmath31 relation ,",
    "we used the same set of calibrators , but analysed them independently .",
    "details are given in appendix  a ; the results are shown in figure  [ fig : epsq ] .",
    "our preferred fit to the data is given by @xmath42 the errors here are 1-@xmath43 for both parameters jointly , and the shift applied to @xmath28 ensures that the fit parameters ( and their errors ) are reasonably uncorrelated . the fit is shown in figure  [ fig : epsq ] and achieves a statistically acceptable @xmath44 without the need to add any intrinsic dispersion in excess of the statistical errors on the @xmath28 and @xmath32 estimates .",
    "thus any intrinsic scatter around the calibrating relation must be small compared to the statistical errors on the data points .",
    "figure  [ fig : epsq ] also allows a direct comparison of our fit to the data against p05 s , as well as against two recent theoretically - motivated calibrations of the @xmath31 relationship ( goodchild & ogilvie 2006 ; pearson 2006 ) .",

    "the data point shown as a thin open symbol shows the upper limit on the mass ratio of bb dor proposed by p05.,width=317 ]    one final point worth noting is that the statistical errors on the fit parameters ( and indeed the uncertainty regarding the functional form of the calibration itself ) translate into _ systematic _ errors on the resulting masses and radii .",
    "the 1-@xmath43 error band arising from the statistical uncertainties on our fit parameters is indicated by the dashed region in figure  [ fig : epsq ] .",
    "formally , this is less than 10% even out to @xmath45 , but the fit is very poorly constrained beyond @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath47 relation could thus change shape in this regime .",
    "the _ statistical _ error on a mass ratio obtained via equation  [ eps3 ] can be estimated by folding the error on @xmath28 through the calibrating relation .",
    "the next key step in the derivation of masses and radii from superhumpers is the assumption of a single primary mass for most systems in the sample .",
    "the worry here is not so much that the assumed mass might differ from the true mean wd mass for cvs .",
    "this would simply shift all ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) pairs along a line of slope 1/3 , but would not alter the _ shape _ of the donor mass - radius relation .",
    "instead , the main concern is that @xmath33 might exhibit systematic trends within the observed cv population , most importantly with orbital period .",
    "such trends _ could _ affect the shape of the mass - radius relation .    in order to test whether this is a problem , we can check if there is any dependence of @xmath33 on @xmath1 among cvs with reliable wd mass estimates ( i.e. eclipsing systems ) .",
    "p05 actually tabulate all available @xmath33 estimates derived from eclipsing cvs . in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : m1 ] , we plot these estimates as a function of @xmath1 for all systems with @xmath50  hrs .",

    ", we simply note that a linear fit to the data yields a slope consistent with zero .",
    "the best - fitting constant @xmath33 yields a mean wd mass of @xmath53 and requires an intrinsic scatter of @xmath54 .",
    "thus we confirm p05 s assertion that , in the absence of other information , @xmath33 can be estimated as @xmath34 with about 20% uncertainty .",
    "we finally note that the global intrinsic dispersion  @xmath55 , i.e. 21%  is the _ statistical _ error associated with taking @xmath34 for any particular system . by contrast , the formal error on the mean wd mass ( @xmath56 ) translates into a _ systematic _ error on donor masses and radii ( since a shift in the assumed @xmath33 affects all affected data points in the same way ) .",
    "having dealt with the @xmath31 calibration and the assumption of constant @xmath33 , we are ready to calculate an updated set of @xmath17 and @xmath18 values ( with statistical errors ) for all superhumpers . we list these in table  [ tab : superhumpers ] .",
    "our estimates are not identical to those derived by p05 , since we have used a different @xmath31 calibration and have explicitly accounted for the intrinsic dispersion in @xmath33 when estimating the statistical errors . however ,",
    "as expected , the overall pattern presented by the data is much the same .",
    "the main change in the data values is a slight shift towards higher masses , which arises because our @xmath32-estimates are generally a little higher than p05 s for fixed @xmath28 ( see figure  [ fig : epsq ] ) .      in principle",
    ", we could now simply fit the @xmath26 pairs in table  [ tab : superhumpers ] ( supplemented with data for eclipsing systems ) .",
    "however , there are actually additional empirical constraints that can ( and should ) be imposed on the mass - radius relation .",
    "these constraint come from the observed locations of the period gap and of the period minimum .",
    "let us first consider the period gap .",
    "the bottom panel in figure  [ fig : m2r2 ] shows the @xmath26 estimates from table  [ tab : superhumpers ] , along with similar data for eclipsing systems , taken from table  8 in p05 .",
    "there is a clear discontinuity in donor radii at @xmath57 , with donors in long - period systems being larger than those in short - period systems . as discussed in more detail by p05 ,",
    "the transition is quite sharp and broadly consistent with the standard cv evolution scenario .",
    "briefly , we should expect systems just above and below the period gap to have identical donor masses , since cvs evolve through the period gap as detached binaries , with no significant mass loss from the secondary .",
    "however , their radii must differ , since both short- and long - period donors must still obey the period - density relation for roche - lobe- filling stars ( equation  [ dense ] ) . more specifically ,",
    "if we denote the upper and lower edges of the period gap as @xmath58 , the ratio of donor radii at the gap edges must satisfy @xmath59 physically , donors above the gap are larger since they lose mass at a much higher rate than those below and are therefore forced more out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "if we accept the premise that cv donors evolve through the period gap as detached systems , the data in figure  [ fig : m2r2 ] suggests that the critical donor mass at which mass transfer stops ( and then restarts ) is @xmath60 , where the estimated error is purely statistical . in other words",
    ", @xmath61 is the donor mass at both edges of the period gap . given empirical estimates for the location of these edges , we can therefore use the period - density relation to determine @xmath62 , i.e. the radii of donors at the gap edges .",
    "thus the locations of the gap edges ( @xmath58 ) fix the @xmath26 relations for long- and short - period systems at @xmath61 and @xmath58 .",
    "figure  [ fig : periods ] shows the orbital period distribution of cvs drawn from the ritter & kolb ( 2003 ) catalog ( edition 7.6 ) in both differential and cumulative form .",
    "the period gap is obvious in these distributions .",
    "we have carried out repeated measurements of the gap edges from this data with a variety of binning schemes . based on these measurements ,",
    "we estimate @xmath3  hrs and @xmath63  hrs .",
    "it is worth noting that the number of systems inside the gap increases towards longer periods .",
    "this may be due to low - metallicity systems , which are expected to invade the gap from above ( webbink & wickramasinghe 2002 ) .        [",

    "the main goal of this paper has been the construction of a complete , semi - empirical donor sequence for cvs that is based on our best understanding of donor properties and is consistent with all key observational constraints .",
    "this donor sequence is provided in table  [ tab : donorseq ] and is based primarily on an updated version of the mass - radius relationship for cv secondaries determined by p05 .",
    "it also relies on a ms - based mass - effective temperature relation that has been shown to be appropriate for cv donors by theoretical work , and on up - to - date stellar atmosphere models . by design",
    ", the donor track also reproduces the observed locations of the period gap and the period minimum , and extends beyond this to the period bouncer regime .",
    "we have shown that this sequence provides an excellent match to the observed @xmath6-@xmath1 relation for unevolved cv donors ( i.e. @xmath24  hrs ) , and that it correctly traces the lower envelope of the @xmath9 distributions of cvs .    along the way , we have revisited and updated two important results on cv donors by p05 and b98 .",
    "regarding the former study , we have carried out a full , independent analysis of the superhumper and eclipser data that was used by p05 to construct their empirical @xmath26 relation .",
    "we constructed and used our own @xmath64 calibration for superhumpers , verified the validity of the constant @xmath33 assumption on which the method rests , imposed the locations of the period gap and the period minimum as constraints on the mass - radius relation and used a self - consistent fitting technique to extract optimal parameters for the @xmath26 relations for long - period cvs , short - period cvs and period - bouncers .    regarding the study by b98",
    ", we have updated their @xmath6 data base for cv secondaries .",
    "our new sample contains 91 cv donors with spectroscopically - determined @xmath6 estimates ( compared to 54 donors in the b98 sample ) . comparing the @xmath6-@xmath1 distribution to that of ms stars",
    ", we find that cv donors have later spectral types at all orbital periods .",
    "this extends the finding of b98 to the short - period regime ( @xmath65  hrs ) .",
    "we find that there is remarkably little intrinsic scatter about both the mean @xmath26 and @xmath8 relations for cvs with @xmath50  hrs : probably no more than a few percent in @xmath18 and less than 1 spectral sub - type .",
    "this suggests that , on long time - scales , most cvs do indeed follow a unique evolution track , just as is theoretically expected ( e.g. kolb 1993 ; stehle , ritter & kolb 1996 ) .",
    "the large scatter in luminosity - based accretion rate estimates at fixed @xmath1 ( e.g. patterson 1984 ) is therefore probably caused by fluctuations around the mean mass transfer rate on time - scales that are short compared to the time - scale on which the donor loses mass and the binary evolves ( see bning & ritter 2004 and references therein ) . in principle , the empirical @xmath26 relationship for cv donors can be inverted to infer the long - term average mass - transfer rate as a function of orbital period ; this will be the subject of a separate paper .",
    "an important feature of our donor sequence is a sharp decline in effective temperature , luminosity and optical / ir brightness , well before the period minimum is reached .",
    "in fact , the l / t transition essentially coincides with @xmath66 on the evolution track ( although this statement depends somewhat on the validity of our spectral type calibration in a sparsely populated regime ) . beyond @xmath66 , even the accretion - heated wd alone",
    "is expected to outshine the donor at optical wavelengths and it is comparably bright to the donor even in the infrared .",
    "all of this helps to explain why brown dwarf donors have proven so difficult to detect in cvs , especially in suspected period bouncers .",
    "finally , we have looked at one obvious application of our donor sequence , the determination of distance estimates from infrared photometry . we have shown that robust lower limits can indeed be obtained , but that , in our calibration sample , these are typically a factor of two smaller than the true distances .",
    "thus , even in the infrared , the donor typically contributes only @xmath6730% of the total flux .",
    "distance estimates that explicitly allow for this average donor contribution are typically good to about a factor of 2 in our calibration sample .",
    "i am extremely grateful to joe patterson and isabelle baraffe for their input and many useful discussions .",
    "isabelle baraffe also kindly provided some of the isochrones that are used in this paper .",
    "i am also grateful to the referee , robert connon smith , for his careful and useful report .",
    "finally , thanks to france allard for making nextgen , ames - dusty and ames - cond model atmosphere grids available via her website .",
    "here we provide some additional details on the way in which we calibrated the @xmath31 relation . as already noted in section  [ sec : calib ] , we rely on the same calibrators as p05 ( given in their table  7 ) , but there are a few differences between their treatment of the problem and ours .",
    "first , the two calibrators with the most precise mass ratios are xz eri and dv uma ( feline et al . 2004 ) . in both cases ,",
    "feline et al . obtained their final @xmath32-estimates as weighted averages over the mass ratios determined in 3 different photometric bands .",
    "however , we found the individual @xmath32-estimates for both systems were not quite consistent at the level expected based on their internal errors .",
    "we therefore re - averaged the individual @xmath32 values , but allowed explicitly for just enough intrinsic dispersion to make the values in all bands consistent with each other .",
    "the resulting new mass ratios were @xmath68 ( xz eri ) and @xmath69 ( dv uma ) .",
    "the implied changes to the mass ratios are relatively small , but the increase in the formal errors is important ( since these two data points would otherwise be given too much weight in the calibration ) .",
    "second , we took note of the approximate upper limit on the mass ratio of bb dor suggested by p05 ( @xmath70 ) , but did not explicitly enforce it in our fits . instead , we decided to check _ a posteriori _ if our fits significantly violated this approximate constraint or not .",
    "third , we chose to treat @xmath32 ( rather than @xmath28 ) as the independent variable of the problem , since the ultimate goal is to estimate @xmath32 from a measured @xmath28 .",
    "fourth , we experimented with a variety of different families of 2-parameter curves , including linear fits ( with constant term ) , quadratic fits ( with no constant term ) and power laws .",
    "we found that the preferred functional form for the @xmath31 relation is linear , i.e. @xmath71 , with @xmath72 and @xmath73 constants .",
    "we obtained optimal estimates of @xmath72 and @xmath73 by minimizing the @xmath74 of the model with respect to the data , allowing explicitly for errors in both @xmath32 and @xmath28 and also for the possibility of intrinsic scatter around the relation , @xmath75 .",
    "the goodness - of - fit metric then becomes @xmath76 the @xmath31 relation given in the main body is the minimum @xmath74 solution",
    ". it does not significantly violate the approximate upper limit on bb dor s mass ratio and achieves a statistically acceptable @xmath44 with @xmath77 .",
    "thus any intrinsic scatter around the calibrating relation must be small compared to the statistical errors on the data point .",
    "p05 explicitly added an extra 5% uncertainty on both @xmath32 and @xmath28 when carrying out their fits .",
    "we appreciate their rationale for doing this ( allowing for variability in superhump periods and unaccounted - for external errors in published mass ratio estimates ) ; indeed , we accounted for the possibility of a non - zero @xmath75 in our fits for exactly the same reasons .",
    "however , it simply turns out that such additional error contributions are not actually demanded by the data .",
    "in order to test if there is evidence for evolution of @xmath33 , we fitted a straight line to the @xmath78 eclipser data points with @xmath79  hrs given in table  7 in p05 .",
    "orbital period errors are negligible compared to the errors on @xmath33 and to the intrinsic dispersion , so we used the @xmath74 metric @xmath80 here , @xmath81 is the error on @xmath33 and @xmath75 is the intrinsic dispersion around the fit .",
    "the intrinsic dispersion is set to the value needed to obtain a reduced @xmath82 , where @xmath83 ; for the linear fit , this value is @xmath54 .",
    "the corresponding constraints on the slope and intercept are shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : m1 ] , and the best - fitting line itself is plotted in the bottom panel .",
    "there is certainly substantial scatter among the @xmath33 values , but the best - fitting slope is not significantly different from zero . thus there is no convincing evidence for a trend of @xmath33 with @xmath1 .",
    "the best - fitting constant @xmath33 , using the same @xmath74 metric , but with slope fixed at @xmath84 , yields a mean wd mass of @xmath85 .",
    "it requires the same level of intrinsic scatter as the linear fit , i.e. @xmath86 .",
    "these results may seem at odds with the studies of webbink ( 1990 ) and smith & dhillon ( 1998 ) , both of whom suggested that cvs below the gap tend to have lower wd masses than those above the gap . more specifically ,",
    "smith & dhillon [ webbink ] derived weighted mean masses of @xmath87 [ @xmath88 below the gap a nd @xmath89 [ @xmath90 above the gap .",
    "two points are important to note here .",
    "first , the weights that were used in calculating these weighted means were the inverse variances of the formal errors on the individual data points .",
    "second , the quoted uncertainties on the means are the formal errors on the weighted means , rather than the dispersion of the points around the means . if we calculate the same quantities for our sample ( in which there are 8 short- and 8 long - period systems ) , we find weighted means with formal errors of @xmath91 below the gap and @xmath92 above the gap .",
    "so if we had used these measures , there would appear to be a significant difference between short- and long - period systems for our sample , too .",
    "the resolution of this apparent paradox is simple .",
    "as already noted by smith & dhillon , the weighted means and their formal errors are quite misleading , since they can be totally dominated by a few systems with small formal uncertainties .",
    "if the true intrinsic dispersion among the sample being averaged is larger than these formal uncertainties  as it clearly is here  then the formal error on the weighted mean ( and even the weighted mean itself ) is rather meaningless . from a statistical point of view",
    ", such a sample violates the basic premise underlying the calculation of the weighted mean , which is that each data point is drawn from a distribution with the same mean , with a variance given solely by the formal error .",
    "smith & dhillon also give the unweighted means and dispersions for their sample , which are @xmath93 below the gap and @xmath94 above the gap . for our sample ,",
    "the corresponding numbers are @xmath95 below the gap and @xmath96 above the gap .",
    "this already shows that the differences between short- and long - period systems are much less significant than suggested by the formal weighted means and errors , and that any real trend with @xmath1 that might be present is small compared to the intrinsic dispersion .",
    "however , the best way to estimate the means , error on the means and intrinsic dispersion is via the statistic given by equation  [ chi2 ] ( again with slope fixed at @xmath84 ) .",
    "this accounts explicitly for _ both _ the formal errors and intrinsic dispersion , with the latter being adjusted to yield a reasonable @xmath97 .",
    "if we do this separately for short- and long - period systems in our sample , we find @xmath98 with @xmath99 below the gap and @xmath100 with @xmath101 above the gap .",
    "as expected , these numbers are not significantly different from each other anymore .",
    "we wish to obtain an optimal estimate of the mass - radius relation of cv donors from a set of ( @xmath102 ) pairs . as noted in section  [ sec : fitting ] , the key challenges are to acccount for the correlated nature of the errors on @xmath17 and @xmath18 and to self - consistently impose the external constraints derived from the locations of the period gap and the period minimum . in addition , we also need to allow for intrinsic scatter around the mass - radius relation .",
    "we begin by defining the analytical form of the mass - radius relation we wish to fit to the data .",
    "based on inspection of the data in figure  [ fig : m2r2 ] , we will follow p05 and describe the mass - radius relation as a power law , @xmath103 here and below , we drop the subscript `` 2 '' on the mass and radius in order to keep the notation transparent . in practice , we carry our fits out in log - space , where the power law transforms into the linear relation @xmath104    in the absence of additional constraints , both @xmath105 and @xmath73 would be free parameters of this model . however , as discussed in section  [ sec : constraints ] , we will demand that @xmath106 at @xmath107 and @xmath108 at @xmath109 . the easiest way to accomplish",
    "this is to adopt @xmath110 for long- and short - period cvs and @xmath111 for period bouncers . with these choices of reference mass , @xmath105 is fixed ( to within some error ) by the period - density relation for roche - lobe filling stars ( equation  [ r2_2 ] ) .",
    "thus for long period cvs , we have @xmath112 similar relations hold for short - period cvs and period bouncers .",
    "note that in all these relations , @xmath58(or @xmath66 ) and @xmath61 ( or @xmath113 ) are empirical estimates with associated unertainties .",
    "as discussed further below , these uncertainties translate into a systematic error on each data point that needs to be accounted for in the final fit .",
    "however , let us first deal with the correlation between the @xmath114 and @xmath115 estimates for a given system . the easiest way to achieve this is to work exclusively in terms of @xmath114 .",
    "for example , consider a particular data point ( @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 ) in the short - period regime ( the corresponding derivation for long - period systems and period bouncers is identical ) .",
    "the residual between this point and the model prediction is @xmath119 . using equations  [ r2_2 ] ,  [ model ] and  [ ref ] ,",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath120 let us ignore the systematic errors arising from the uncertainties on @xmath61 and @xmath121 for the moment and consider only the statistical variance on @xmath122 .",
    "this is @xmath123 where we have neglected the error on @xmath118 which is always much smaller than that on @xmath124 .",
    "an optimal estimate for @xmath73 could then be obtained by minimizing the usual @xmath74 statistic @xmath125 or , if we additionally want to allow for an intrinsic variance @xmath126 , @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the number of data points .",
    "we should also face up to the uncertainties on @xmath61 and @xmath121 .",
    "it is tempting to simply account for these in the denominator of equation  [ chistat ] .",
    "however , this would be incorrect , since any change in these quantities affects all residuals in the same way : @xmath129 and @xmath130 are _ systematic _ errors in this context .",
    "let us define the systematic variance on each residual as @xmath131 it is then possible to define a new @xmath74 statistic that has the correct distribution and accounts for both @xmath132 and @xmath133 . following stump et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we find that in our case , this statistic is @xmath134 ^ 2 } { 1 + \\sum_{i=1}^{n } \\frac{\\sigma_{sys}^2}{\\sigma_{stat , i}^2 + \\sigma_{int}^2}}. \\label{chistatsys}\\ ] ]    the only uncertainties we have not explicitly accounted for in our fits are ( i ) the error on the mean white dwarf mass adopted for superhumpers and appendix  [ app : primary ] . ] and ( ii ) the errors on the parameters of the @xmath31 calibration . as discussed in sections  [ primary ] and [ sec : calib ] , these uncertainties also translate into systematic errors on the data points . in principle , it would be possible to formally account for these systematics in a similar way as we just did for the errors on @xmath58 and @xmath61 , for example",
    ". however , in practice , such a treatment would be considerably more difficult and ( in our view ) a little pointless .",
    "the added difficulty arises partly because these new systematics do not affect all data points in a given mass / period regime ( i.e. only the superhumpers , but not the eclipsers ) ; the error on the calibration parameters , in particular , does not even affect all superhumpers in the same way .",
    "we feel the additional complexity this would introduce is not warranted . after all , regarding ( i ) , we already know that the error on the mean @xmath33 is small compared to intrinsic dispersion around this mean , which we do account for ( see section  [ primary ] ) . and regarding ( ii ) , we already noted in section  [ sec : calib ] that the systematic uncertainty associated with the @xmath31 relation is small in the well - calibrated regime , but not necessarily well - described by the formal parameter uncertainties in the poorly - calibrated regime . rather than attempt to include this",
    "poorly defined systematic in our fits , we thus prefer to simply emphasize its existence .",
    "the optimal estimate of the power - law exponent @xmath73 is obtained by minimizing equation  [ chistatsys ] . for long- and short - period systems",
    ", we determine the appropriate level of @xmath75 by requiring that the reduced @xmath74 should be equal to one ; for period bouncers , the reduced @xmath74 is slightly less than one even without any intrinsic dispersion .",
    "however , this is probably more of a reflection of the sparseness of the data in this regime than of any true constraint on @xmath75 .",
    "we therefore conservatively adopt the value of @xmath75 obtained for short - period cvs for the period bouncers as well .",
    "errors on the power law exponents can be estimated in the usual way .",
    "for example , the 1-@xmath43 confidence interval around @xmath73 corresponds to the range of exponents for which @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the lowest value of @xmath74 .    in order to test this method ,",
    "we have carried out monte carlo simulations .",
    "thus we created fake data sets with known slopes and subject to all of the errors we are trying to account for in our fits . in these simulations , the method did a good job in recovering the correct slope , and the distribution of the recovered slopes had a dispersion consistent with the estimated error on the slope ."
