    "the past two years have seen the development of some new application of conformal field theory ( cft ) methods to the study of critical models in dimension bigger than two and , more specifically , close to their upper critical dimensions @xcite .",
    "the simple requirement that a theory is conformal invariant at a critical point , rather than simply scale invariant , strongly constrains the form of its correlators @xcite and allows to write several nontrivial relations among them @xcite .",
    "the two key ideas behind this approach are to achieve consistency between conformal symmetry and the equations of motion through the use of the operatorial schwinger - dyson equations ( sde ) , and to ensure regularity with the gaussian theory when the dimension approaches its upper critical value in a limiting procedure .",
    "such a method has been able to reproduce the leading results for the @xmath7-expansion of the ising , lee - yang , and tricritical ising universality classes .",
    "these results are very amusing in that none of the standard methods of quantum field theory ( qft ) are used , including perturbation theory and the renormalization group , but just the knowledge of free ( gaussian ) theory results for the correlators given by the wick contractions .",
    "these achievements thus point at the idea that cft might work as a fully consistent replacement of the standard methods when critical properties are under investigation",
    ".    we will be interested in generalizing this idea to theories governed by the general @xmath8 potential . in a ginzburg - landau description",
    "their action is @xmath9 & = \\int { \\rm d}^dx \\bigl\\{\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_\\mu\\phi\\partial^\\mu\\phi+\\frac{g}{m!}\\phi^{m } + \\sum^{m-1}_{k=0}\\frac{g_k}{k ! } \\phi^k\\bigr\\}\\ , , \\end{split}\\ ] ] for @xmath4 a natural number bigger than two .",
    "these models can be divided into two classes : on the one hand if @xmath10 , i.e.  even , they are the so - called multi - critical models which are protected by a @xmath11 parity ( @xmath12 ) and include both the ising ( @xmath13 ) and tricritical ( @xmath14 ) universality classes as the first special cases . ising model at criticality is only one specific realization of the ising universality class and the two should not generally be confused .",
    "the paper will deal with universality classes to a greater extent . ] in the landau - ginzburg approach the @xmath15 effective potential describes a statistical system with a phase - transition that can be reached by opportunely tuning the _ coupling _ @xmath16 to a positive value , and in which @xmath17 distinct minima of the potential become degenerate @xcite . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath18 , that is odd , represents a sequence of multi - critical non - unitary theories which are protected by a generalization of parity and include the lee - yang universality class ( @xmath5 ) as first example .",
    "the non - unitary nature manifests itself in that the critical value of the coupling @xmath16 must be a purely imaginary number for the odd potentials .",
    "we will see in more detail at the beginning of the next section why , within a cft approach , all the subleading couplings @xmath19 of do not play a significant role in tuning the action to criticality , therefore for the moment we shall simply ignore them .",
    "the upper critical dimension of is defined as the dimension @xmath20 at which the coupling @xmath16 is canonically dimensionless @xmath21 a simple application of the ginzburg criterion confirms that above the upper critical dimension the statistical fluctuations are weak and the physics of is gaussian and controlled by mean - field critical exponents , while below the upper critical dimension the fluctuations are strong enough to change the scaling properties and to provide the field @xmath22 with an anomalous dimension . in the latter case",
    "a consistent expansion for the critical exponents can be achieved by studying the system slightly below the upper critical dimension @xmath23 which for small @xmath7 tames the fluctuations and provides all the physically interesting critical quantities in the form of a taylor series in @xmath7 .. ]    the most important critical exponents of all the aforementioned special cases ( ising , tricritical and lee - yang ) are known to high orders of the @xmath7-expansion @xcite .",
    "the leading and next - to - leading contributions in the @xmath7-expansion of are known in general for all the even potentials @xmath10 thanks to the application of standard perturbation theory , @xmath24-methods and renormalization group analysis @xcite , while less is known for the odd potentials . to underline how interesting and unexpected the results of @xcite for the even potentials are ,",
    "let us point out that for @xmath25 the leading contributions arise from _ multiloop computations _ , and that for @xmath26 the divergences are subtracted as poles of the _ fractional _ dimensions @xmath27 of !",
    "another interesting property is that the even models are known to interpolate in @xmath3 with the _ unitary _ minimal cfts @xmath28 for @xmath29 , which arise from the representations of the infinite dimensional virasoro algebra @xcite .",
    "similarly , there are speculations @xcite pointing at the fact that the non - unitary models might interpolate with the sequence of minimal non - unitary multi - critical theories @xmath30 studied in @xcite .",
    "this is established for the lee - yang case @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "it is thus legitimate to generalize the arguments made for @xmath5 in @xcite , for @xmath13 in @xcite and for @xmath14 in @xcite , and assume that for each value of @xmath4 the multi - critical models at the critical point are conformal field theories for any dimension @xmath31 .",
    "the straightforward question that we will dare to answer in this paper is : how proficient will the dyson - schwinger consistency be in determining the critical properties of ?",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ section_sde_and_cft ] we briefly summarize the main features of the schwinger - dyson consistency condition as well as some important property of cft . in sect.s [ section - even - potentials ] and [ section - odd - potentials ] we treat the cases of even and odd potentials respectively .",
    "all the results of these two sections are summarized in the subsections [ summary_even ] and [ summary_odd ] . in sect .",
    "[ conclusions ] we attempt a unified conclusion and give some future prospects .",
    "the appendices collect some formulas which are very useful for our manipulations , in particular appendix [ free ] deals extensively with the free theory in arbitrary dimension and the counting of the wick theorem , while appendix [ lapla ] collects few relations involving the action of the laplacian on the cft correlators .",
    "we dedicate this section to a brief but more technical introduction to the application of the schwinger - dyson consistency condition in cft . furthermore , some formulas of sect .",
    "[ section_introduction ] necessitate further clarifications for their application to cft , therefore there will be some slight overlapping with the previous section .",
    "let us begin by introducing the action of the scalar @xmath0-theory @xmath32 = \\int d^d x \\ ,   \\bigl\\ { \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\partial \\phi)^2 + \\mu ^{\\left(\\frac{m}{2}-1\\right ) \\epsilon}\\frac{g } { m ! } \\phi^{m }    \\bigr\\}\\,,\\ ] ] in @xmath20 dimensions , for @xmath20 sufficiently close to the upper critical dimension as in eqs .   and .",
    "the careful reader should have noticed several important details in comparing with . in",
    "we introduced a reference ( mass ) scale @xmath33 which makes the almost marginal coupling @xmath16 dimensionless for any @xmath20 .",
    "the presence of the mass scale @xmath33 underlies the fact that the action is not conformal invariant for all values of @xmath16 , which in fact must be tuned to its critical value as will be done later in the paper .",
    "nevertheless , we could exclude all the strictly dimensionful couplings @xmath19 that appeared in from .",
    "the reason is that , since we are interested in the underlying conformal theory , which by definition does not depend on external scales , all couplings with positive mass dimension must vanish at criticality .",
    "this multi - critical tuning corresponds to the point in which , for example , all the @xmath17 different phases of a @xmath15 theory coexist .    before diving more deeply into some technical details , it is worth noting that , with the exception of the cases @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the upper critical dimension @xmath36 is a rational number . more generally , after the displacement by @xmath7 all the theories will live in the arbitrarily real dimension @xmath37 .",
    "theories living in continuous dimensions have already been investigated as cft with conformal bootstrap methods @xcite : they are now believed to violate unitarity through the appearance of complex conjugate pairs of scaling dimensions , which are probably related to `` evanescent '' operators that couple to the spectrum only at non - integer dimensionalities and are associated to states with negative norm @xcite .",
    "while this is a very interesting line of research which deserves further investigation , we shall not deal with these aspects and assume that conformal symmetry , unitary or not unitary , is realized for any value of the dimension @xmath20 .",
    "ising universality class .",
    "this evidence has been recently supported at theoretical level  @xcite . ]",
    "the key idea of @xcite is that all the cft data of must interpolate with that of the gaussian theory in the limit @xmath38 .",
    "we set some notation by defining the scaling dimensions for the field @xmath22 and the composite operators @xmath8 of an interacting scalar theory in @xmath20 dimensions .",
    "let the canonical dimension of @xmath22 be @xmath39 and the scaling dimensions of @xmath22 and @xmath6 be respectively @xmath40 the @xmath41-terms represent the corrections from the canonical scaling dimensions @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and therefore must be proportional to some power of @xmath16 or @xmath7 to ensure consistency of the gaussian limit .",
    "the schwinger - dyson equations ( sde ) generalize the notion of equations of motion of at a functional and at an operatorial level .",
    "neglecting contact terms , any insertion of the equations of motion in a correlator constructed with a string of operators returns zero . in practice , for any state of the cft and for any list of operators",
    "@xmath44 the relation @xmath45 holds . in general the sde",
    "are constructed with renormalized quantities where explicit @xmath7-dependences do appear through the renormalized coupling in @xmath46 $ ] . however , at the lowest order one can use the relation @xmath47 at tree level .",
    "thanks to the schwinger - dyson equation one can deduce that in the interacting cft the operator @xmath22 and @xmath6 with @xmath48 are primaries , while the operator @xmath49 is a descendant .",
    "is the derivative of a primary operator , which is annihilated by the generator of the special conformal transformations .",
    "we shall not be concerned with the higher complexity of the @xmath3 case . ] in other words , the interacting cft enjoys one less independent operator , that is @xmath49 , and a recombination of the conformal multiplets must take place . in particular , the scaling dimensions of @xmath22 and @xmath49 must be constrained @xmath50    furthermore , conformal symmetry greatly constrains the correlators appearing on both sides of the sde .",
    "it is possible to find a basis @xmath51 of scalar primary operators with scaling dimensions @xmath52 whose two point correlators are diagonal @xmath53 ( no summation over @xmath54 ) where we denoted as @xmath55 the general non - negative normalization factors which can in principle be set to one .",
    "however , for the moment , we will find it more convenient to work with the natural normalization of the gaussian theory , that is induced by wick counting .",
    "the tree - point correlator for scalar primary operators is even more constrained by conformal symmetry and reads @xmath56 are known as the structure constants of the cft ( we will adopt the notation with the commas whenever a potential notational ambiguity arises ) .",
    "our cfts are completely and uniquely specified by providing the scaling dimensions @xmath52 and the structure constants @xmath57 , which together are known as _ cft data _ and which are for obvious reasons paramount target of any computation .",
    "our goal is to extract the leading informations for a part of the conformal data of all the multi - critical cft ( including scaling dimensions and structure constants ) .",
    "our results can be seen as the first step before investigating such an infinite family of multi - critical theories at an interacting fixed point in @xmath58 dimensions as a power series in @xmath59 , eventually with also conformal bootstrap techniques .",
    "this section is dedicated to the investigation of the even potentials @xmath15 in @xmath60 dimensions which arise as the special case @xmath10 of and which are explicitly @xmath11 symmetric under parity . throughout this section",
    "we will reserve the symbol @xmath17 exclusively for the natural number bigger than one , which is half of @xmath4 whenever @xmath4 is even .",
    "naturally , @xmath17 is in one - to - one correspondence with the model and labels its criticality , which is the number of degenerate ground states at the critical point . to give the results some context , we find useful to explicitly list the first few critical dimensions : starting from the case @xmath61 that corresponds to the ising universality class ,",
    "the upper critical dimensions are @xmath62 they become purely rational numbers starting from @xmath63 , corresponding to the tetracritical universality class , which in @xmath3 describes the 3-states potts model at criticality . in the limit @xmath64",
    "the critical dimensions tend to two , that is the dimensionality for which the canonical dimension of the field is zero and all couplings are canonically marginal . from our point of view",
    ", the study of the even models is particularly interesting because it allows for a direct and very general comparison of our results with those obtained in @xcite , and serves as a testing ground for the entire method .    in the first part of this section , we will kickstart the computation by obtaining the anomalous dimension for the field @xmath22 by using a constraint which comes from the consistency of the two point function with the sde in the limit @xmath65",
    ". then we will repeat the process by requiring consistency of the three point function to determine the scaling dimensions of all the composite operators @xmath6 .",
    "we will see that @xmath66 , which is related to the anomalous scaling of the correlation length , requires a separate discussion for all the theories with @xmath67 . in the second part of this section",
    "we will determine several of the structure constants @xmath57 which appeared in .",
    "in particular , we will mostly concentrate on those that are not present at zeroth order in @xmath7 and are thus generated at quantum level .",
    "in the third part we will exploit the fact that the scaling dimension of the @xmath68 descendant operator can be computed in two different ways and use it to find a critical value for the coupling @xmath16 as a function of @xmath59 .",
    "we will also manifest some explicit relation with the standard perturbation theory of @xcite .",
    "all the results are summarized at the end of the section .",
    "our first goal is the computation of the leading order ( lo ) anomalous dimensions of the field @xmath69 and of the composite operators @xmath70 with @xmath71 . by lo we will generally mean leading order in @xmath16 and in @xmath7 . only when an explicit relation @xmath72 will be available ( as for even potentials in section  [ gofederiv ] ) , leading order will mean leading order in @xmath7 .",
    "we start with a simple analysis of the two point function that will directly uncover a precise leading order relation between @xmath69 and the coupling @xmath16 .",
    "the determination of @xmath66 requires the analysis of three point function @xmath73 and is a bit more involved for @xmath67 .",
    "finally we shall be able to obtain the anomalous dimensions @xmath70 with @xmath74 from the study of @xmath75 . in these first computations",
    "we will proceed step by step in order to explain the details of the method we employ .",
    "we assume the knowledge of the free theory correlators as detailed in appendix  [ free ] .",
    "let us consider in @xmath20 dimensions the propagator of the interacting theory @xmath76 the renormalized result for the cft ( e.g.  at the fixed point ) is characterized by a normalization which at lowest order is given by the free theory one @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is given in eq .  .",
    "thus we will make the replacement @xmath79 everywhere from now on .    on applying first the sde in one point",
    "one shows that @xmath69 is at least of order @xmath80 .",
    "then applying the sde also to the second point gives the leading expression for @xmath69 in terms of @xmath16 .",
    "acting with a laplacian in eq .",
    "using @xmath81 and recalling @xmath82 gives @xmath83 in this case the determination of the leading order contribution amounted to the substitutions @xmath84 in the numerator and @xmath85 in the denominator , where @xmath86 is the upper critical dimension value of @xmath42 .",
    "computing instead the above expression using the sde one finds @xmath87 this is because the two point function on the right hand side vanishes in the free theory .",
    "therefore @xmath69 is at least of order @xmath80 . to obtain another useful relation one acts with a laplacian in @xmath88 , computes explicitly the expression in terms of the anomalous dimensions and compares the result to the one obtained applying the sde . from the first computation one",
    "gets @xmath89 where to determine the lo contributions we used @xmath90 in the numerator and @xmath91 in the exponent in the denominator . applying the sde and using the free result for the two point function of eq .   of appendix",
    "[ free ] gives instead @xmath92 by comparing eq .",
    "and eq .   one immediately finds the leading contribution to the anomalous dimension @xmath93 using the fact that c = we find the explicit formula @xmath94 which agrees with the perturbative result  @xcite .      to determine @xmath66 we need to consider the three point functions .",
    "the simplest correlator where it appears is @xmath95 in this correlator the sde can be used twice at the points @xmath96 and @xmath88 .",
    "the action of one laplacian can be easily obtained from eq .   given in appendix [ lapla ] by setting @xmath97 and @xmath98 @xmath99 from this expression we easily determine the leading order contributions @xmath100 where we also made the leading order substitution @xmath101 .",
    "this expression should match the one obtained by applying the sde @xmath102 where we used @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , comparison with eq .   shows that @xmath104 for @xmath67 while it is of order @xmath105 only for @xmath61 , for which case it is determined by the following expression @xmath106 in order to find the leading value of @xmath66 in the general case @xmath67 we act with the second laplacian in @xmath88 . using eq .   from the appendix [ lapla ] and keeping the leading contributions one finds ( we skip the intermediate steps ) @xmath107 which we should compare with the leading order result obtained applying the sde , @xmath108 so that by comparison we obtain @xmath109 using the explicit expression for @xmath69 given in eq .",
    "we find @xmath110 this quantity has not been reported in the perturbative results given in  @xcite .      to determine @xmath70 at first we could think to consider @xmath111 , but this correlator is zero in the free theory whenever @xmath112 . to investigate all @xmath113",
    "we instead consider the following three point function @xmath114 the general expression on the right hand side is valid for primary operators , that is for @xmath115 . indeed for @xmath116 other terms are present .",
    "nevertheless , if one restrict the analysis to the lowest order , these extra terms which are subleading can be neglected and can be used also for these two cases , as will be discussed in the subsection  [ gofederiv ] .",
    "the leading value for the normalization is obtained from the free theory approximation from the general expression   and reads @xmath117 the main recursion relation can then be derived for @xmath118 applying a laplacian in @xmath96 and exploiting the relation given by the sde .",
    "using the relation in appendix  [ lapla ] one can compute the action of a laplacian in @xmath96 on the correlator for which , following the same reasoning of the previous subsections , we find the following lo expression @xmath119 on the other hand using the sde one gets @xmath120 where @xmath121 vice versa when @xmath122 the free correlator is zero and the the full correlator in eq",
    ".   is at least of order @xmath123 .",
    "the expression obtained from the sde in eq .",
    "has a leading term @xmath105 , and recalling from eq .   that @xmath124 , one is forced to conclude that the first term in eq .",
    "is negligible and that @xmath125 .",
    "then by comparing eqs .",
    "and   one finds the recurrence relation @xmath126 the recurrence relation for the anomalous dimensions associated to a difference of order @xmath105 ceases to exists for @xmath127 and is substituted by some relation involving @xmath123 corrections",
    ". therefore we expect @xmath128 for @xmath129 . with this condition",
    "one can solve the recurrence relation to obtain @xmath130 which is in perfect agreement with the perturbative result  @xcite . note that in the case @xmath61 we correctly reproduce eq .  .",
    "the above relation says that for @xmath131 the leading contribution to the anomalous dimensions is of @xmath132 .",
    "it is evident from our derivation of eq .  , which is simply based on cft invariance and the sde , that this equation is valid for any @xmath133 .",
    "in fact at this order , i.e.  @xmath132 , one can also see from the point of view of perturbative renormalization group that the anomalous dimensions are not affected by the mixing with derivative operators  @xcite .",
    "the contribution from mixing with derivative operators may start only at next to leading order @xmath134 , and for @xmath135 .",
    "besides the scaling dimensions , a cft is also characterized by the structure constants of the three point correlators , which are related to the ope coefficients .",
    "we explore here the possibility to extract in the most generality some of them at leading order for the whole family of even universality classes .    in order to get some information from the three point functions using the schwinger - dyson equations we need to have one of the fields to appear with power one .",
    "the @xmath136 are already explored and give information on the scaling dimensions @xmath137 .",
    "in the following we therefore concentrate on the rest of these correlation functions .",
    "the remaining correlation functions consist of @xmath139 , @xmath140 .",
    "these vanish in the free theory , so they can give information on the structure constants @xmath141 and imply that these are at least proportional to the coupling or smaller . now if @xmath142 also vanishes in the free theory it implies that @xmath141 are at least of order @xmath123 and to find their value at leading order we need to know @xmath142 beyond free theory",
    ". therefore we will not be able to extract the leading order information on @xmath141 this way , but for the case discussed in the next subsection .    for @xmath143 not to vanish in the free theory we must have the following conditions .",
    "since @xmath144 is odd , either @xmath133 or @xmath145 must be even while the other must be odd , so we restrict ourselves to @xmath146 , with @xmath147 . as previously discussed , the condition for this to be nonzero is k+l - n0 + l+n - k1 + k+n - l 0 .",
    "these are equivalent to @xmath148 .",
    "furthermore we must have @xmath149 otherwise we will be back to the case @xmath136 which is already studied . in summary , for @xmath150 satisfying the conditions",
    "k+ln , 1-nl - kn , l - k0 or 1 , [ opeset ] we can find the leading order ( @xmath105 ) structure constants @xmath138 .",

    "one readily sees , using the relation @xmath153 , that the denominators in the above two expressions are equal . comparing the coefficients we find c_1,2k,2l-1 , [ c12k2lm1 ] where c^_2n-1,2k,2l-1 = c^n+k+l-1 and @xmath78 is the normalization of the free propagator given in eq .  .",

    "vanishes for @xmath162 .",
    "this means that for these values of @xmath133 the leading order expression will involve the anomalous dimensions and the present analysis will give relations involving these quantities . restricting to the case @xmath163",
