    "as the nearest celestial body that is well understood and is capable of stimulating and responding to the phenomena associated with the dark matter ( dm ) , the sun is presumed to be an ideal host for the dm detection .",
    "for one thing its deep gravitational well attracts and traps the galactic dm particles through the scatter off solar elements , if there exists a dm - nucleon interaction at the weak scale .",
    "for another thing these captured dm particles may accumulate in the solar core and subsequently annihilate to primary and secondary high energy neutrino flux that escape from the dense solar plasma , leaving a smoking - gun for their presence in the sun . at present , a number of terrestrial neutrino detection projects such as icecube  @xcite , super - kamiokande  @xcite , baikal neutrino project  @xcite and antares  @xcite are dedicated to such observational mission .",
    "in general , the neutrino flux at the detector location is related to the solar dm annihilation through the following schematic relation : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the sun - earth distance , @xmath2 and @xmath3 represent the neutrino differential flux at the earth and the neutrino energy spectrum per dm annihilation event in the sun , respectively . the total annihilation rate @xmath4 can be expressed in terms of the number of the trapped dm particles @xmath5 : @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes twice the annihilation rate of a pair of dm particles .",
    "the evolution of the solar dm number @xmath5 is depicted with the following equation : @xmath8 which involves the dm capture ( evaporation ) rate @xmath9 by scattering off atomic nuclei in the sun , as well as the annihilation rate @xmath7 .",
    "( [ eq : master equation-1 ] ) has an analytic solution @xmath10 with    @xmath11    the time scale for the capture , evaporation and annihilation processes to equilibrate .",
    "once the equilibrium is reached at the present day , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , with @xmath14 being the solar age , the annihilation output @xmath15 also reaches its maximum value . as will be shown in sec .",
    "[ sub : evaporation ] , a @xmath16 increment in the dm mass parameter results in @xmath17 orders of magnitude reduction in the evaporation rate @xmath18 in the few-@xmath16 region . thus depending on the ratio @xmath19",
    ", such equilibrium can be categorized into two different scenarios : ( 1 ) @xmath20 , that s when the evaporation effect can be neglected and the equilibrium is between annihilation and solar capture , @xmath12 , @xmath21 , so we can either determine or constrain the strength of the dm - nucleon interaction from solar neutrino observation ; ( 2 ) @xmath22 , under this circumstance evaporation overwhelms annihilation for the dm depletion , and the balance between evaporation and solar capture yields @xmath23 , which not only implies a heavy suppression of the neutrino flux , but also prevents us from drawing the coupling strength of the dm - nucleon interaction from the possible observed signals .",
    "therefore , from the theoretical point of view it is interesting to pin down the parameter space where the neutrino observation is relevant for the dm detection .",
    "conventionally , such purpose is fulfilled with a characteristic quantity , the evaporation mass @xmath24 , which is defined with equation @xmath25 for the given dm - nucleon coupling . above the evaporation mass",
    "one can safely assume that the capture - annihilation equilibrium is reached .",
    "the key point of the problem is to calculate the distribution of the solar dm . while in ref .",
    "@xcite authors adopts a maxwellian distribution to describe the non - thermal equilibrium between the solar dm particles and solar nuclei , the studies in refs .",
    "@xcite indicate a deviation from the maxwellian form , in a manner that the actual velocity distribution is suppressed at the tail and tends to be anisotropic at large radius .",
    "such deviation can be attributed to the fact that the energetic collisions that send the dm particles into high orbits occur predominantly near the hot core of the sun , so as a result one expects a lower angular momentum distribution for the high - energy orbits . in order to well describe the physical processes such as evaporation and energy transfer of the solar dm ,",
    "an accurate description of the tail of the velocity distribution is necessary .",
    "in addition , since the evaporation mass has been studied thoroughly in the literature under the assumption of a constant dm - nucleon cross section  @xcite , the quest to the extend the discussion to a broader set of dm - nucleon effective interaction operators naturally arises .",
    "for instance , it is tempting to evaluate the evaporation rate for the light asymmetric dm particle with a dm - nucleon scattering amplitude linearly proportional to the square of the transferred momentum @xmath26 , because while the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite manage to resolve the disagreement between the solar model and helioseismological data with preferred dm mass of @xmath27 gev and coupling strength of @xmath28 , the evaporation effect is not included in their discussion . given small dm masses as such , evaporation",
    "may no longer be neglected in the buildup of the solar dm , and a quantitative analysis is needed on this issue .",
    "thus , as a tentative study we investigate the implications of the non - relativistic spin - independent ( si ) effective operators on the solar dm distribution and evaporation mass .",
    "the set of 15 galilean invariant operators is introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite as a comprehensive and convenient treatment for the dm - nucleus interaction in the dm direct detection .",

    "@xcite we calculate the non - thermal distribution of the solar dm by monte carlo methods , and numerically compute evaporation rates for different si dm - nucleus effective operators .",

    "<S> as a part of the effort to investigate the implications of dark matter ( dm)-nucleon effective interactions on the solar dm detection , in this paper we focus on the evaporation of the solar dm for a set of the dm - nucleon spin - independent ( si ) effective operators . in order to put the evaluation of the evaporation rate on a more reliable ground </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the non - thermal distribution of the solar dm using the monte carlo methods , rather than adopting the maxwellian approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we then specify relevant signal parameter spaces for the solar dm detection for various si effective operators . </S>",
    "<S> based on the analysis , we determine the minimum dm masses for which the dm - nucleon coupling strengths can be probed from the solar neutrino observations . as an interesting application </S>",
    "<S> , our investigation also shows that evaporation effect can not be neglectd in a recent proposal aiming to solve the solar abundance problem by invoking the momentum - dependent asymmetric dm in the sun . </S>"
