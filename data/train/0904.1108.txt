    "the flipped - su(5 ) [ @xmath15 su(5)@xmath16u(1)@xmath17 model , called su(5)@xmath18 , was contrived for the alternative embedding of the standard model ( sm ) su(2 ) singlets in the irreducible representations of the su(5 ) grand unified theory ( gut ) @xcite in contrast to the well - known georgi - glashow su(5)@xmath19 @xcite . as a result",
    ", a distinctive feature of the su(5)@xmath18 is an interesting gut breaking mechanism through the higgs representation @xmath5  of su(5 ) rather than the adjoint * 24 * , reducing the rank of the su(5)@xmath18 by one unit .",
    "a great virtue of the su(5)@xmath18 is the relative ease of the doublet / triplet splitting in the higgs representations , @xmath1   and @xmath3 , through a simple missing partner mechanism @xcite , which is also a result of such an embedding of the sm fermions .",
    "another characteristic feature of the su(5)@xmath18 is practically the absence of predicted fermion mass relations between quarks and leptons in contrast to the su(5)@xmath19 gut . as in the case of the sm , supersymmetric ( susy ) extension of the flipped - su(5 ) @xcite achieves also the gauge coupling unification with the lep values of coupling constants @xcite , if the normalization of the hypercharge is assumed to be that of the so(10 ) gut , @xmath20 .    with the advent of string constructions of the susy gut models , and particularly , with the realization of the difficulty in obtaining adjoint higgs for gut breaking in string theory , the gut breaking by the higgs representations @xmath5@xmath9 and @xmath7@xmath10 in the su(5)@xmath18 became a great advantage .",
    "earlier string construction obtaining 4-dimensional ( 4d ) flipped - su(5 ) guts was done in the fermionic construction @xcite .",
    "recently , a realistic model has been obtained in a @xmath21 orbifold construction @xcite .    since mid 1990s",
    ", dynamical susy breaking ( dsb ) toward phenomenological models has been advocated to resolve the susy flavor problem @xcite .",
    "the well - known simple dynamical susy breaking ( dsb ) representations in the hidden sector are @xmath22  plus @xmath23  of su(5)@xmath12 @xcite , and * 16*@xmath12 of so(10)@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "other hidden sector gauge groups may be possible , but here we concentrate on a simple su(5)@xmath12 model with only one family , i.e. @xmath22  plus @xmath23 , because of its relatively easy realization in heterotic string compactification .",
    "recent dsb models at unstable vacua are known to be possible with vector - like representations in the hidden sector @xcite , which became popular because of our familiarity with susy qcd . for su(@xmath24)@xmath12 ,",
    "the dsb requirement on the number of flavors in the susy qcd is @xmath25 . for su(5)@xmath12 , @xmath26 and 7 satisfy this requirement .",
    "the dsb possibility from the heterotic string has been suggested by one of the authors at the unstable vacuum @xcite and at the stable vacuum @xcite . in particular , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) obtained in @xcite with the su(5)@xmath12 gauge group and one family of @xmath27  @xmath28  @xmath29  in the hidden sector has many nice features such as the r - parity , one pair of higgs doublets , and vector - like exotically charged states ( exotics ) ; but the bare value of the weak mixing angle is not @xmath30 .",
    "the weak mixing angle would be , however , fitted to the observed one with the power - law type threshold effects contributed by the kaluza - klein towers @xcite , if relatively larger extra dimensions are assumed .",
    "the so - called susy guts arise in two disguises : one is ( usual ) 4d susy guts such as the dimopoulos - georgi model @xcite and the flipped - su(5 ) @xcite , and the other guts in higher dimensions ( @xmath31 ) as discussed in @xcite . in a 4d susy gut ,",
    "the sm gauge group is obtained by spontaneous symmetry breaking of the gut , whereas in a higher dimensional gut it is achieved by the boundary conditions .",
    "string constructions of the mssm @xcite actually provided the idea of the higher dimensional susy gut . in this paper",
    ", we will study a 4d susy gut from a string compactification .",
    "in particular , based on the @xmath21 orbifold compactification of the heterotic string theory , we will construct a susy model su(5)@xmath32su(5)@xmath12 , where the first ( second ) su(5 ) indicates the gauge group of the visible ( hidden ) sector : the su(5)@xmath18 for the visible sector is broken to the sm gauge group by the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of higgs fields @xmath33 , and the su(5)@xmath12 in the hidden sector becomes confined at lower energies , achieving dsb with one family of ( @xmath27  @xmath28",
