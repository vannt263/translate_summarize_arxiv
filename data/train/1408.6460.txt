    "by accepting the universality of the quantum superposition principle , it should be possible to observe classical macro objects in a superposition of two distinguishable positions .",
    "however , so far no signature of superposition states has been observed at the macro - scale .",
    "macro objects behave classically , while tremendous manifestations of superposition states have been observed at the micro - scale .",
    "this state of affairs immediately raises the following questions  @xcite : does the superposition principle really hold true at the macro - scale ?",
    "is there a division between the micro and the macro world ?",
    "if so , what is responsible for it ?",
    "collapse models  @xcite provide a well - defined phenomenology to answer these questions .",
    "initiated by the seminal works of ghirardi , rimini , weber , and pearle , collapse models assume a universal stochastic noise that couples non - linearly with matter .",
    "this non - linear coupling induces a localization in space , which kills superpositions with the correct quantum probabilities .",
    "the strength of the coupling is fixed by phenomenological parameters defining the models .",
    "the collapse rate then grows by increasing the size and complexity of the system such that the effect of the collapse process is negligible at the micro - scale , and becomes dominant when moving toward the macro - scale . in this way , within a unique dynamical equation , both the quantum and the classical world can be described consistently .",
    "collapse models are phenomenological models .",
    "their justification from fundamental physical principles is not yet known and it very much depends on one s view about the physical origin of the collapse field",
    ". a natural explanation can be provided by _ gravity _ , because gravity is universal and its strength increases with the mass of the system .",
    "in fact , these are two crucial properties of the collapse field .",
    "the connection of the collapse field with gravity has been explored by many authors  @xcite , in particular by krolyhzy _ et .",
    "@xcite , disi  @xcite and penrose  @xcite , independently .",
    "here , we will focus on the works of disi and penrose , which is usually called as dp model .",

    "to regularize the dynamics , disi proposed to introduce a cut - off .",
    "although the introduction of the cut - off prevents the divergence in the evolution equation of the statistical operator , the energy of the system increases monotonically and goes to infinity .",
    "even more , with the originally proposed value of the cut - off , the rate of the energy increase is too high , giving rise to the problem of overheating , as shown in  @xcite . as a consequence ghirardi _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a much larger cut - off , which , however , is less justified on a physical ground .",
    "we will come back on this issue in section  [ sec : overheating ] .",
    "an immediate question would be if there is any other resolution for the overheating and the energy divergence problems in the dp model .",
    "here we shall elaborate this question in detail .",
    "first , we will show that the model is structurally equivalent to the the mass - proportional continuous spontaneous localization ( csl ) model  @xcite .",
    "we will then discuss the connection of dp model with gravity .",
    "we will also discuss the analogy of the dp equation to the typical master equations for collisional decoherence . using this analogy",

    "the overheating problem should be resolved by introducing dissipative terms , while preserving the translation - covariance of the dynamics .",

    "these modes are also small enough to justify the non - relativistic approach .",
    "this interpretation is very similar to bethe s non - relativistic computation of the lamb shift ( e.g. , see  @xcite ) .",

    ". describes a pure decoherence dynamics with no dissipation  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the total transition rate , i.e. the probability per unit time that the particle undergoes a collision , is @xmath43=\\text{s}^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with eq . in hand , one can also easily find the solution of the dp master equation , at least for a single free particle . using the characteristic function  @xcite , the state at time @xmath44 in the position representation , @xmath45 ,",
    "is found to be @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the solution of the free schrdinger dynamics and @xmath48 is the newtonian self - interaction where erf@xmath49 is the error function . if one neglects the pure schrdinger contribution in eq .",
    ", which is justified on the short time scale , then eq . reduces to an exponential decay of the form : @xmath50 where the characteristic damping time @xmath51 is : @xmath52 for @xmath53 , one finds that @xmath54 , which is of the order @xmath55 with @xmath56amu and @xmath57 m . as usual in collapse models @xcite , we will thus exploit @xmath58 to estimate the collapse rate of the model .",
    "equation implies that spatial superpositions of positions @xmath59 and @xmath60 decays with the rate @xmath61 .",
    "this is precisely penrose s",
    "idea  @xcite .",
    "according to penrose , a spatial superposition of matter generates the superposition of two bumps in the space - time .",
    "in this situation , the time - translation operator is ill - defined .",
    "this ill - definedness leads to an uncertainty in the energy which is given , in the weak - field limit , by the newtonian gravitation self - energy of the corresponding mass distribution at two positions , i.e. @xmath62 . using the energy - time uncertainty relation , this can imply that the superposition decays to one of the localized states with the lifetime @xmath63 , which is equivalent to eq .. therefore , disi s dynamical equation implements penrose s idea .",
    "this is why one speaks of disi - penrose model .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that the dp model is not a gravity - induced collapse model , as was clear to the original proposers who always spoke in terms of gravity-_related _ models  @xcite .",
    "the dp dynamics in eq .",
    "is simply postulated and there is no real physical justification for it besides the requirements of the state vector normalization and no faster than light signaling  .",
    "in addition , gravity only appears in the correlation function of the collapse field as a newtonian potential ; there is no gravitational interaction between matter and gravity in the dp model .",
    "therefore , penrose s original idea still remains without a satisfactory explanation , not even at the phenomenological level .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the dp collapse model shares strong similarities with the mass - proportional continuous spontaneous localization ( csl ) model  @xcite .",
    "the csl model is originally formulated in terms of quantum field theory  @xcite . however ,",
    "if we restrict to the @xmath64-particle sector of the fock space , its defining stochastic differential equation can be expressed through the local mass density operator @xmath26 as given in eq .. explicitly , we have @xmath65 |\\psi_t\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66amu is a reference mass , and @xmath67 is a new intrinsic parameter of the model setting the collapse strength  @xcite ; note that a much higher value , @xmath68 , was proposed more recently  @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath69 is a gaussian function : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the second new intrinsic parameter of the model . the white - noise field @xmath72 satisfies eq .",
    "and eq . replaces eq ..    manifestly , the structure of the csl equation in eq . is the same as that of the dp dynamics given in eq .. the only difference is the spatial correlation function of the noise : a gaussian function in the csl model and the newtonian potential in the dp model .",
    "the dp choice , which is meant to establish a connection with gravity , requires the introduction of a spatial cut - off in order to avoid divergences , as we discussed before .",
    "the csl model on the other hand requires two new parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath74 defines the correlation function of the noise , and @xmath73 sets the strength of the localization processes . in the dp model",
    "the strength of the localization processes is set by the constant @xmath13 , as a phenomenological signature of the gravity .",

    "it means that the momentum fluctuations are indeed much larger in the dp model , giving rise to an unacceptable rate of the energy increase .",
    "we shall discuss this issue later .",

    "one can see how the damping time decays as a function of the distance in a very similar fashion in the two cases .",
    "the crucial difference is that the decay length is fixed by the localization width @xmath74 in the csl model , while it is fixed by the cut - off @xmath21 in the dp model . as a consequence ,",
    "the superposition between two states centered around two different positions at a fixed distance @xmath88 is suppressed much more quickly in the dp model .     as a function of the distance @xmath88 for the dp model ( black line ) and for the csl model ( red , dashed line ) .",

    "@xmath149=\\text{kelvin } \\text { , } [ m_r]=\\text{amu } \\text { , and } [ r_0]=\\text{m}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if the collapse noise is real , then , whatever its nature , it must be a low - temperature noise ( like the cosmic microwave background ) , with a temperature of few kelvins ; any other choice would be difficult to justify .",
    "accordingly , we have the following relation between the parameters of the dissipative dp model : @xmath150=\\text{amu }    \\text { , and } [ r_0]=\\text{m}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by setting @xmath57 m in eq .",
    ", one finds : @xmath151 .",
    "but then , for masses @xmath152 , the dissipation parameter @xmath128 is very large , meaning a dissipation mechanism which is too strong , as it involves an unrealistic amount of exchanged energy between the system and the noise .",
    "in fact , for @xmath153 the action of the noise would likely determine a sudden flip of the system s momentum , as one can infer by looking at the probability distribution of the exchanged momentum @xmath154 .",
    "this is obtained by the operator @xmath155 and hence also depends on the momentum of the system .",
    "explicitly , for @xmath156 , we have that if the system has momentum @xmath157 the probability distribution associated with the exchanged momentum is well approximated by : @xmath158 where @xmath159 is a normalization constant .",
    "hence , the most probable event is a decrease of momentum @xmath160 along the direction fixed by @xmath161 ; moreover , the width of the probability distribution is the narrower the higher the value of @xmath128 .",
    "the momentum flip induced by the universal noise field causing the collapse of the wavefunction would mean that the latter can transfer an energy of the order of tens of mev to a nucleon in a nucleus ( corresponding to the average kinetic energy of a nucleon in a fermi - gas model @xcite ) , which would induce instantaneous matter dissociation .",
    "accordingly , with @xmath57 m , the dp model is only an effective model for the mass ranges larger or comparable with @xmath162amu . in other words ,",
    "the dp model should be applied only to mesoscopic and macroscopic systems .",
    "a similar conclusion has been obtained by disi  @xcite , from a different perspective .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the value @xmath130 is also very different from the plank mass @xmath163amu , which is sometimes considered as a borderline between quantum and classical masses  @xcite .    for ghirardi s cut - off value @xmath164 m",
    ", one finds : @xmath165amu . relying on the analogy with collisional decoherence ,",
    ", the dissipative effects are now much weaker compared with the case of the original cut - off since the mass of the environmental particles is much smaller .",
    "we can conclude that , unless one admits a limited applicability of the dp model , the introduction of a cut - off of the order of @xmath74 can not be avoided , even with the introduction of dissipation .",
    "the goal of a gravity - induced collapse model is to explore the possibility perhaps only at the phenomenological level  that the collapse of the wave function is caused by gravity .",
    "apart from much talking , in the literature only two such models ( defined in terms of dynamical equations ) have been proposed : the schrdinger - newton equation , and the disi - penrose ( dp ) model . in",
    "@xcite we have analysed the schrdinger - newton equation , and we have shown that in its present form it is not able to explain the collapse of the wave function in any satisfactory way .    in this paper , we have analysed the dp model .",
    "this model has the virtue of giving a dynamical explanation for the collapse rate suggested by penrose .",
    "however , it does not succeed in a more ambitious goal : it does not explain why the collapse should be related to gravity . in the dp model , the noise ( whose origin is not explored ) does not couple to matter like a gravitational noise field is expected to do .",
    "this is in contrast with the schrdinger - newton equation , where the newtonian self - interaction of different parts of the wave function is manifest .",
    "contrary to the schrdinger - newton case , the dp model is structurally equivalent to the csl model , the only difference being a different choice of the spatial correlation function of the noise .",
    "therefore , from the conceptual point of view the dp model is on the same level as the grw and csl models , and it is not derived from more fundamental principles .    the original dp model was defined in terms of only the gravitational constant @xmath13 , and no other parameter .",
    "however , because of divergences , one still needs to introduce a cut - off .",
    "a natural cut - off would correspond to the compton wavelength of the nucleon , that justifies the non - relativistic approach .",
    "however , the model remains unrealistic , as it predicts a too high energy increase .",
    "a much higher  and less justified  cut - off is needed , to restore compatibility with known experimental facts .    in this paper",
    ", we explored a very natural way of dealing with the energy increase : we included dissipative terms in the dynamics , which already allowed us to solve the problem of the energy divergence in both the grw and the csl model @xcite .",
    "the motivation for such an approach is very simple : non - dissipative models ( corresponding to an infinite - temperature bath / noise ) are only idealization of more realistic situations , where the bath / noise has a finite temperature and the system interacting with it eventually thermalizes to that temperature .",
    "however , even in this case , the dp model remains unphysical , unless the cut - off is kept artificially large .",
    "the conclusions seems to be that the dp model can be used to describe the collapse of massive composite systems , while its application to smaller systems such as atoms and nucleons is problematic .",
