    "fullerenes which encapsulate atomic nitrogen ( such as @xmath8 ) have been shown to contain an electron spin benefiting from long relaxation times and narrow linewidths in electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr )  @xcite .",
    "such properties make @xmath9 an attractive candidate building block for a quantum information processing device  @xcite and a powerful spin probe for measuring environments such as the interior of nanotubes  @xcite .    relaxation in unmodified @xmath9 has been found to be driven by a vibrational orbach mechanism  @xcite . if the fullerene is modified by a functional group in such a way as to introduce a zero - field - splitting ( zfs ) , the fluctuation of this zfs due to molecular tumbling in liquid solution provides an additional relaxation pathway characterized by the magnitude of the zfs , and the rotational correlation time of the molecule .",
    "thus , by measuring t@xmath4 and t@xmath5 , respectively the spin - lattice and phase memory relaxation times , it is possible to probe the molecular dynamics of fullerene derivatives in solution .",
    "the fluctuating zfs mechanism is expected to produce a biexponential decay in both t@xmath4 and t@xmath5 , assuming the molecule is not in the ` fast - tumbling ' limit .",
    "such a biexponential decay was not observed in earlier studies on fullerene derivatives , reportedly due to limited signal to noise and a relatively fast rotational correlation time .",
    "the effect of nuclear spins in the solvent may also have complicated the analysis by adding additional relaxation pathways  @xcite .",
    "the observation of a biexponential decay is simplified by choosing a bulky functional group , such as pyrrolidine , to slow down the rotation further .    in this letter",
