    "the @xmath3ray sky has been successfully observed by satellite based missions in the energy range between 50 @xmath4 and 30 @xmath5 @xcite . at higher energies",
    "the steeply falling @xmath3ray spectrum makes it impossible to observe by satellite based detectors , primarily because of the limited detector size and exposure time available for a given source .",
    "alternatively , the ground based atmospheric erenkov technique has been successfully exploited at these energies . over the years",
    ", this technique has proved to be the most sensitive in studying the celestial @xmath3rays in the very high energy ( vhe ) range , @xmath6 - 50 @xmath7 .",
    "celestial vhe @xmath3rays initiate an electromagnetic cascade in the atmosphere as they enter the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the electrons and positrons in the cascade , being relativistic , emit erenkov light as they propagate down the atmosphere resulting in a faint flash of bluish light lasting a few nanoseconds .",
    "this directional erenkov flash is detected on the ground by conventional optical light detectors during moon - less clear nights .",
    "taking advantage of the fact that the erenkov flash is highly collimated , within a cone of half angle @xmath8 , along the direction of the incident particle most experiments simply limit the optical field of view of the erenkov telescopes to a small region of the sky .",
    "however the main drawback of this technique is the presence of abundant cosmic ray background which severely limit the sensitivity of this technique .",
    "numerous efforts to develop methods to distinguish the erenkov light pool produced by cosmic @xmath9rays from that by the cosmic rays led to two important techniques based on complementary ways of viewing the cascade , _ viz .",
    "_ the angular sampling or the _ imaging technique _ and spatial sampling or the _ wavefront sampling technique_. both these techniques are currently being employed by different groups @xcite .    the possibility of timing the erenkov light front for the estimation of arrival direction of the primary has been realized as early as 1968 by tornabene and cusimano @xcite .",
    "it was later demonstrated by the durham group @xcite that while viewing crab pulsar the on - axis events were richer in @xmath10-rays than off - axis events .",
    "it was also used by gupta _",
    "et  al._@xcite to improve the signal to noise ratio of atmospheric erenkov telescopes consisting of large mirrors with poor optical quality .",
    "the basic principle of all these experiments is the fast timing technique using spatially separated erenkov telescopes .",
    "the signal to noise ratio in such an experiment is given by  @xcite @xmath11 where _",
    "@xmath12 _ and _ @xmath13 _ are the fluxes of omni - directional cosmic rays and @xmath14 rays from a point source respectively .",
    "_ a _ is the collection area of the array , _ t _ is the time of observations , _",
    "@xmath15 _ is the solid angle of acceptance , _",
    "@xmath16 _ is the fraction of showers due to cosmic rays that are identified and rejected as background and _ @xmath17 _ is the fraction of showers due to @xmath3rays that are identified as signal and hence retained . in order to achieve high @xmath18 apart from increasing @xmath17 and _ @xmath16",
    "_ one could either increase the collection area and the observation time or decrease the solid angle of acceptance . for a given exposure time and available hardware resources one can possibly increase _",
    "s / n _ by only reducing @xmath15 as celestial @xmath14 rays from point sources are directional while cosmic rays are isotropic . due to the finite opening angle of the erenkov cone and the spread in the arrival angle of erenkov photons the aperture of the telescopes",
    "have to be restricted to few degrees , which sets a lower limit to _",
    "@xmath15_. however , it is possible to improve the @xmath18 for point sources without losing erenkov light if the direction of arrival of primary particles is estimated accurately @xcite .",
    "the shower axis retains the original direction of the primary .    to estimate the arrival direction accurately",
    ", the error in the reconstructed direction , _ i.e. _ the angular resolution has to be very small .",
    "the two dominant factors which contribute to the angular resolution are the average distance , _ d _ , between the telescopes and _ @xmath19 t _ , the uncertainty in the measurement of arrival time of photons at the telescopes .",
    "for example , the angular resolution in the zenith angle , @xmath20 for @xmath21 detectors is given by @xcite : @xmath22    therefore , a large number of telescopes with instrumentation to measure the relative arrival time of photons and separated by large distances are needed to reconstruct the shower front and estimate the direction of arrival of the shower fairly accurately .",
    "on the other hand , in case of the imaging technique the angular resolution is limited by pmt(pixel ) size which is typically of the order of a quarter degree .",
    "the improvement in the signal to noise ratio by restricting the angle of acceptance to @xmath23 would be : @xmath24 this is a very significant advantage of non - imaging arrays with high angular resolution .",
    "moreover , this method of reducing background is independent of the primary species .",
    "hence it is extremely useful at very low primary energies where the cosmic ray electrons form a significant source of background .",
    "electrons can not be discriminated easily , unlike hadrons , since they too undergo electromagnetic interactions in the atmosphere akin to @xmath14 rays .",
    "however one has to bear in mind that the angular resolution could be poorer at lower primary energies due to paucity of erenkov photons at the ground level .    in the rest of the paper",
    "we discuss the method of obtaining the arrival direction of the primary radiation using our array of erenkov telescopes and estimate its error .",
    "the experiment at pachmarhi ( longitude : 78@xmath25 26@xmath26 e , latitude : 22@xmath25 28@xmath27 and altitude : 1075 @xmath28 ) , is based on the wavefront sampling technique and employs an array of erenkov telescopes , called the pachmarhi array of erenkov telescopes(pact ) , to sample the erenkov light pool .",
    "pact is now fully functional .",
    "the experimental set - up of pact has been explained in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "briefly , it consists of a @xmath29 array of atmospheric erenkov telescopes deployed in the form of a rectangular matrix with a separation of 25 _ m _ in the n - s direction and 20 _ m _ in the e - w direction .",
    "each telescope consists of 7 parabolic mirrors of 0.9 _ m _ diameter mounted paraxially and having a focal length of 90 _ cm_. each mirror is viewed by a fast photo - multiplier tube ( pmt , emi 9807b ) at the focus behind a circular mask of @xmath30 3@xmath31 diameter .",
    "however the field of view is limited by the diameter of the pmt photo - cathode to @xmath30 2.9@xmath31 _",
    "fwhm_.    the array has been divided into 4 sectors with six telescopes in each .",
    "the pulses from 7 pmts in a telescope are added linearly to form a telescope sum pulse called _",
    "royal sum_. each _ royal sum _ from the 6 telescopes in a sector are suitably discriminated ( typical _ royal sum _",
    "rates @xmath30 30 - 50 khz . ) and a trigger is generated by a coincidence of any 4 of these 6 _ royal sums_. the typical event rate is @xmath30 2 - 5 hz . for every event ,",
    "information on the relative arrival times and density of erenkov photons are recorded for the 6 peripheral mirrors / pmt in each telescope in each sector .",
    "the relative arrival times of _ royal sum _",
    "pulses are recorded both in the respective sector and in the central data processing station .",
    "thus , pact measures the arrival time of shower front at various locations within the erenkov light pool at two distance scales , _ short range _",
    "( intra - telescope ) and _ long range _",
    "( inter - telescope ) .",
    "the arrival direction of the shower is estimated from the measured arrival times of erenkov photon front at each of the spatially separated telescopes while the six adjacent measurements in a given telescope could be used to study the fluctuations in the measured shower parameters .",
    "the dispersion of photon arrival times at each telescope contain the signature of the primary species @xcite and hence could be used to distinguish between @xmath14 rays from the background @xcite .",
    "the density measurements on the other hand enable us to estimate the energy of the primary species as well as to reject cosmic ray background @xcite .",
    "the telescopes are equatorially mounted and each telescope is independently steerable in right ascension and declination within @xmath32 .",
    "the movement of the telescopes is remotely controlled by automatic computerized telescope orientation system ( actos )  @xcite .",
    "the hardware for actos consists of a semi - intelligent closed loop stepper motor drive system which senses the angular position using a gravity based angle transducer called _ clinometer _ with an accuracy of 1@xmath33 .",
    "the two clinometers , one each in n - s and e - w direction , are accurately calibrated using stars at various hour - angles and declinations .    in order to estimate the source pointing error of the system",
    ", the telescopes were oriented to different bright stars at random positions in the sky and the offsets in orthogonal directions ( ascension and declination ) with respect to the star were noted . using this data",
    "it is concluded that the system can orient the telescopes to the putative source with a mean offset of @xmath34 .",
    "the source pointing is monitored with an accuracy of @xmath35 and corrected in real time during tracking .",
    "the uncertainty in pointing represents the subjective error in manual reading of the star position at the cross wire of the guiding telescope field of view  ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "as the seven mirrors of a telescope are mounted on a single mount it is necessary to ensure that all their optic axes are parallel to each other so that they view the same part of the sky .",
    "this alignment of mirrors is done manually by positioning the star image at the centre of the focal plane .    to check the accuracy of alignment of the mirrors and telescopes a bright star drift scan",
    "is carried out .",
    "the telescope is aligned to an isolated bright star ( typically of visual magnitude 2 to 3 ) .",
    "then the telescope is moved to the west by @xmath37 and at a suitable time the telescope tracking is switched off .",
    "the counting rates from each of the pmts are monitored every second and recorded .",
    "the count rates stay reasonably constant until the star walks into the field of view when they increase , go through a maximum and return to the background value as shown in figure  [ fig : bscan ] .",
    "the background count rates before and after the star transit are fitted to a linear function .",
    "the background is subtracted from the count rates during the star transit by interpolation .",
    "the background corrected count rates are then fitted to a quadratic function .",
    "figure [ fig : bscan ] shows one such fit to a typical count rate profile of a mirror . table  [ tab : bscan ] shows the summary of results of a typical bright star scan .",
    "it shows in column 3 the fwhm of the drift scan profile of the count rates due to the star .",
    "the offset of the centroid of this profile with respect to the centre of the field of view ( _ i.e. _ expected transit time ) is shown in the last column .",
    "this offset is the error in the alignment in right ascension .",
    "the relative fwhm s of the profiles could indicate the misalignment in declination , if any . on the other hand the absolute values of fwhm of the count rate profiles are a function of the pmt gains , image quality ( point source image size @xmath38 ) , star brightness @xmath39 . using this method",
    ", it is ensured that the optical axes of all the 7 mirrors in a telescope are parallel to each other within an error of @xmath40 or less .",
    "if the error exceeds this value the particular mirror is re - aligned and re - checked .",
    "this method of alignment is similar to that adapted for aligning the imaging telescope arrays @xcite .",
    "0.25 cm    .bright star scan results of @xmath41 ursa major for a telescope [ tab : bscan ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the results of the present study it is seen that two independent measurements of the angular resolutions are @xmath42 and @xmath43 resulting from the timing measurements of telescopes and mirrors of the entire array respectively for similar energy events .",
    "the essential difference between the two measurements is an increase in the number of degrees of freedom by a factor of @xmath44 in the latter case . from this consideration",
    "the expected angular resolution for individual mirrors is @xmath45 which is almost twice the value of @xmath46 mentioned above .",
    "these are consistent since the timing uncertainty for _ royal sums _ is higher by the same factor .",
    "figure [ fig : dndom ] shows differential plots of the number of events per solid angle @xmath47 as a function of the zenith angle .",
    "the panel @xmath48 shows plots for events whose arrival directions have been estimated using timing signals from _ royal sums _ while the panel @xmath49 shows the same for individual mirror timing information .",
    "the two curves shown in panel @xmath48 correspond to events detected simultaneously in all the 4 sectors ( solid line ) and in one sector ( # 3 ) only ( dashed line ) .",
    "this provides a method of measuring the effective opening angle of the array @xcite . from these plots",
    "it can be seen that the array field of view is around @xmath50 .",
    "this is significantly lower than the geometric opening angle of @xmath51 .",
    "it may be noted that the effective field of view of the array is expected to be lower than the geometric value primarily because the event trigger efficiency falls with increasing core distance and zenith angle . the other possible factors which could potentially reduce the effective field of view like the residual alignment errors and non - ideal optical quality of the mirrors are relatively less significant .",
    "the effective fwhm of the array ( @xmath52 ) for which the mean telescope separation is @xmath53 is lower than that for a sector ( @xmath54 ) for which the mean telescope separation is @xmath55 supporting the above argument .    the data used for estimating the angular resolution of pact reported here consists of cosmic rays .",
    "it is well known that the protons exhibit a larger ( by almost a factor of 4 ) intrinsic timing jitter relative to @xmath10-ray primaries @xcite .",
    "while the contribution of systematic effects to the timing resolution ( which is estimated to be small ) is independent of the primary species , the decreased intrinsic timing jitter is expected to improve the angular resolution for @xmath10-ray primaries significantly .",
    "table [ tab : comp ] summarizes the angular resolution of imaging as well as non - imaging atmospheric erenkov telescopes currently in operation and under construction .",
    "it can be seen that the angular resolutions of most of the single imaging telescopes are modest , in the range @xmath56 .",
    "wavefront sampling experiments using the modified solar concentrator arrays like the stacee , celeste , graal @xmath57 , will not be able to exploit their angle reconstruction technique to reject a significant cosmic ray background primarily because of their rather small field of view , in the range @xmath58 ( fwhm ) which are comparable to their angular resolutions .",
    "pact , on the other hand , has the best angular resolution among the non - imaging experiments which can be used to enhance the signal to noise ratio significantly .",
    "pact has been able to achieve this because of multiple fast timing measurements at each telescope .",
    "this has two - fold advantages : firstly , it provides an increased number of degrees of freedom which in turn improves the accuracy of angle reconstruction and secondly , it provides a means of computing the erenkov photon arrival time dispersion at each telescope .",
    "the timing jitter is a species sensitive parameter and hence will enable us reject a significant fraction of on - axis hadronic showers .",
    "the signal to noise ratio could also be improved by using the normalized @xmath59 values resulting from a spherical fit to the timing information of a shower .",
    "this is expected to be larger for hadron initiated showers @xcite .",
    "the future imaging telescope arrays are expected to achieve unprecedented angular resolution by employing the stereoscopic technique .",
    "they are able to reconstruct the shower in 3-dimensions using the multiple images in 3 or more imaging telescopes . from table [",
    "tab : comp ] it can be seen that both the hegra and the shalon - alatoo arrays are able to improve the angular resolution of their single imaging telescopes by a factor of @xmath60 by using 2 or more of them in stereoscopic mode .",
    "it may be mentioned here that the quoted angular resolutions for the future projects listed in the table are from simulation results for @xmath10-ray primaries while the rest are derived from measurements from cosmic ray events .",
    "it is well known that the erenkov light front has a curvature .",
    "it was seen that when two well separated erenkov telescopes were tilted towards each other by about a degree the coincidence rate increased and also reduced the spread in the time separation between them @xcite .",
    "this indicated , as claimed by the authors , the presence of curvature in the photon front .",
    "more recently , it was shown that the radius of curvature of the front is equal to the height of the shower maximum from the observation altitude @xcite .",
    "hence it is clear that a plane front approximation of the erenkov light front will introduce a systematic error in the arrival angle reconstruction .",
    "the large separation of telescopes , to some extent , offsets the worsening of resolution due to the curvature of the light front .",
    "it may also be pointed out that the effect of curvature on the angular resolution is more significant for near vertical showers . in the case of inclined showers ,",
    "the arrival time differences at spatially separated telescopes due to shower axis inclination far exceed the differences arising out of the shower front curvature .",
    "however it has been argued that the angular resolution of given array will improve if one corrects for the wavefront curvature @xcite .",
    "the details of the systematic effects due to the plane front approximation and the improvement in the accuracy of estimated arrival directions when the curvature of the shower front is taken into account are currently under investigation .",
    "a paper based on the results of these simulation studies is under preparation .",
    "a detailed analysis of the angular resolution of pact using data collected with telescopes pointing to zenith is presented .",
    "the improvement in the angular resolution with larger separation between detectors ( _ d _ ) and with increase in the number of degrees of freedom ( _ n _ ) has been verified .",
    "the angular resolution @xmath61 , is found to improve according to the relation : @xmath62    there are two types of angular resolutions that could be defined for pact .",
    "firstly , the fast timing information from the 25 telescopes spread in an area of about @xmath63 yield an angular resolution of @xmath64 .",
    "secondly the timing information from the mirrors constituting the 25 telescopes yield the best angular resolution of @xmath0 at a @xmath10-ray energy of around 3 @xmath7 .",
    "this is the best angular resolution achieved for any ground based atmospheric telescope system which will probably be superseded by the proposed veritas or hess imaging telescope array .",
    "the angular resolution for @xmath10-ray primaries could be significantly better than what is presented here , which is based on cosmic ray primaries , because of two main reasons .",
    "firstly , photon arrival time jitter for @xmath10-ray primaries is far less than that for charged cosmic rays and secondly the radius of curvature for @xmath10-ray primaries is more than that for cosmic rays which consequently reduces the effects of the shower front curvature for the former .",
