    "the macroscopic quantum superpositions referred to as schrdinger cat states are of great interest in the context of the foundations of quantum mechanics  @xcite and are an important resource for quantum measurement techniques  @xcite .",
    "however , cat states are notoriously vulnerable to perturbations caused by interactions with the environment .",
    "even when the interactions are very weak , cat states can easily be destroyed due to their highly entangled nature .",
    "the state change can be measured by the fidelity between the original state and the resulting state , or by the purity of the resulting state . to recover the original cat state",
    ", we could employ a quantum error - correcting scheme  @xcite , which , however , requires a macroscopic number of redundant qubits .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a probabilistic scheme to recover a schrdinger cat state , based on the concept of physical reversibility in quantum measurement  @xcite .",
    "a quantum measurement is said to be physically reversible if there exists a reversing operation that recovers the premeasurement state from the postmeasurement state by means of a physical process with a nonzero probability of success . since an interaction with the environment can be modeled as a kind of quantum measurement , we may expect that the reversing operation could recover the original cat state in a probabilistic way .",
    "however , the interaction with the environment differs from a quantum measurement in that it does not refer to the outcome of the `` measurement '' , and this ignorance usually leads to decoherence of the system .",
    "can the physical reversibility be employed to recover the original cat state even in this situation ?",
    "the previous papers  @xcite on physical reversibility have not addressed this question .",
    "we here give an affirmative answer .",
    "that is , our scheme provides a considerable increase in the fidelity together with an increase in the purity when the interaction of the system with the environment is weak .",
    "the reversing operation invokes a quantum measurement with postselection and thus has a probabilistic nature .",
    "however , the probability of success is high and the reversing operation increases both the mean fidelity and the mean purity .",
    "we shall describe an explicit model using spin systems with an ising - type interaction , and discuss a possible experimental situation .",

    "when the interaction with the environment is weak , @xmath22 should be expanded as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a positive number , @xmath25 is a real dimensionless small parameter characterizing the strength of the interaction between the system and the environment , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are hermitian operators . on the other hand ,",

    "in fact , to an accuracy of order @xmath25 , the left inverse of @xmath17 can be written as @xmath40 it should be emphasized that such a weak interaction with the environment can profoundly disturb a schrdinger cat state due to the effect of @xmath32 . the extent to which the state of the system is disturbed can be evaluated quantitatively in terms of the fidelity of @xmath14 to @xmath3 , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 .",

    "however , we can show that such higher - order terms are irrelevant to the calculation of @xmath250 and @xmath251 to the order of @xmath84 .",
    "the proof goes as follows .",
    "we first consider the contribution of @xmath249 . in",
    "doing so , we can ignore the other operators , since @xmath249 is of the fourth order itself .",
    "we then obtain @xmath252 which results in @xmath253 .",
    "therefore , @xmath249 does not contribute to the fidelity and the purity to the order of @xmath84 .",
    "similarly , @xmath248 does not do so to the order of @xmath254 .",
    "although @xmath248 may appear in the fourth order together with @xmath26 , such a term vanishes because of eq .",

    "this means that each term of @xmath250 and @xmath251 must contain at least one @xmath259 .",
    "since @xmath259 is of the second order , we can set @xmath260 consequently , in order to calculate @xmath250 and @xmath251 to the order of @xmath84 , it is sufficient to use eqs .",
    "( [ eq : forme ] ) , ( [ eq : weakint ] ) , and ( [ eq : formm ] ) .",
    "then , we can straightforwardly derive eqs .",

    "the weight @xmath261 is then a binomial distribution whose mean and variance are @xmath47 and @xmath266 , respectively .",
    "the central limit theorem ( or equivalently stirling s formula ) states that as @xmath137 increases , the binomial distribution becomes close to a normal distribution with the mean and variance unaltered : @xmath267 at the same time , the summation over @xmath114 is replaced with the integral over @xmath114 , @xmath268 since @xmath114 is now considered as a continuous variable from @xmath269 to @xmath270 . using eq .",
