    "scaling ffag rings were proposed independently a half century ago by ohkawa,@xmath1 symon,@xmath2 and kolomensky.@xmath3 the mid - western universities research association ( mura ) built both radial - sector ( 1957 ) and spiral - sector ( 1960 ) models and tested them with electrons . however , the serious development of ffags ceased with the ascendancy of ramping synchrotrons , which allowed smaller diameter , smaller bore rings for a given energy and magnetic field . because the voltage needed to quickly ramp synchrotrons@xmath4 filled with wide bunches of low energy muons",
    "is rather large , ffags have recently experienced a renaissance.@xmath5 the ffag design permits multiple passages of muons though both rf cavities and magnet arcs for reduced cost .",
    "one reason ffag rings are of interest today is because they offer economical muon acceleration for a neutrino factory@xmath6 or a muon collider.@xmath7 at a neutrino factory accelerated muons are stored in a racetrack to produce neutrino beams ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "neutrino oscillations have been observed.@xmath10 further exploration at a neutrino factory could reveal cp violation in the lepton sector,@xmath11 and is particularly useful if the coupling between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 , is small.@xmath15 a muon collider can do s - channel scans to separate the @xmath16 and @xmath17 higgs doublet.@xmath18 above the ilc s 800 gev there are a large array of supersymmetric particles that might be produced,@xmath19 as well as mini black holes,@xmath20 if large extra dimensions exist .",
    "note that the energy resolution of a muon collider is not smeared by beamstrahlung .",
    "a cyclotron has a large volume magnetic field which is constant in time .",
    "particle orbits move from the center to the edge of the cyclotron as they accelerate .",
    "a synchrotron has a small magnetic field volume .",
    "the @xmath21 field increases with time .",
    "particle orbit radii do not change as a particle accelerates .",
    "an ffag ring is in between a cyclotron and a synchrotron in its design .",
    "as particles accelerate they move a small distance in gradient magnets which can accommodate higher energy orbits at slightly different radii .",
    "ffag magnetic fields are fixed in time and their volume is larger than a synchrotron but smaller than a cyclotron .",
    "the most recent neutrino factory design@xmath15 incorporates 5 @xmath22 10 and 10 @xmath22 20 gev non - scaling ffag rings .",
    "acceleration up to 5 gev uses a linac and a dogbone recycling linac.@xmath23 a layout appears in fig .  1 and parameters in table 1 .",
    "the 20 gev ring is almost five times larger than a synchrotron with 5.5 t magnets .",
    "the ratio of focusing  to  bending in an ffag ring is high .",
    "normally resonances are a problem in non - scaling ffags , but the fast muon acceleration cycle can prevent them from building up as can highly symmetric lattice designs .",
    "each cell uses a fdf triplet of superconducting magnets as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "much work has gone into the lattice design to keep the beam size and hence the magnetic apertures relatively small .",
    "the idea is to control cost by reducing the magnetic field volume and by using superconducting magnets with moderate fields .",
    "superconducting rf ( fixed 201 mhz , 10 mv / m ) is used for acceleration .",
    "a niobium coated copper cavity running at 201 mhz has recently achieved a gradient of 11 mv / m and prototypes may reach 15 mv / m.@xmath24 at 201 mhz , @xmath25 = 37 cm , on the same order as the phase difference just due to the muons increasing in speed as shown in the last row of table 1 . its hard to change the rf phase itself quickly .",
    "an advantage of the non - scaling ffag is the additional control over the physical path length muons follow .",
    "path lengths dominate speed increases in determining muon phase with respect to the rf .",
    "3 notes the parabolic time of flight ( tof ) relation that can be achieved .",
    "muons cross the rf crest three times during the acceleration cycle . staying closer to crest",
    "minimizes the amount and cost of rf that is needed . in a scaling ffag ,",
    "tof increases monotonically .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "ffags are being built for muon phase rotation , radiation therapy , ct scanning , and accelerator  driven sub ",
    "critical nuclear reactor operation in japan .",
    "a 1 mev scaling ffag with 8 dfd sectors has been built at kek and has accelerated protons with a 1 khz repetition rate.@xmath26 a 150 mev scaling ffag with 12 dfd sectors is nearing completion .",
    "beam has been accelerated to 150 mev .",
    "orbits shift from a radius of 4.4 to 5.5 m during the acceleration cycle . in these scaling ffags , orbit shapes and magnet focal lengths",
    "are energy independent .",
    "see fig . 2 of ref .  5 for a nice drawing of particle paths in scaling and non - scaling ffags",
