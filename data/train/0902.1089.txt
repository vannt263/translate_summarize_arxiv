    "a revolution is underway in our understanding of the high - energy sky .",
    "the early sas-2 @xcite and cos - b @xcite missions led to the egret instrument @xcite on the _ compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro)_. egret performed the first all - sky survey above 50 mev and made breakthrough observations of high - energy @xmath0-ray blazars , pulsars , delayed emission from @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) , high - energy solar flares , and diffuse radiation from our galaxy and beyond that have all changed our view of the high - energy universe .",
    "many high - energy sources revealed by egret have not yet been identified .",
    "the large area telescope ( lat ) on the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ ( _ fermi _ ) , formerly the _ gamma - ray large area space telescope ( glast ) _ , launched by nasa on 2008 , june 11 on a delta ii heavy launch vehicle , offers enormous opportunities for determining the nature of these sources and advancing knowledge in astronomy , astrophysics , and particle physics . in this paper a comprehensive overview of the lat instrument design is provided , the pre - flight expected performance based on detailed simulations and ground calibration measurements is given , and the science goals and expectations are summarized .",
    "the _ fermi _  observatory had been launched shortly before the submission of this paper so no details of in - flight performance are provided at this time , although the performance to date does not deviate significantly from that estimated before launch . the in - flight calibration of the lat is being refined during the first year of observations and therefore details of in - flight performance will be the subject of a future paper .    _ fermi _  follows the successful launch of _ agile _ by the italian space agency in april 2007 @xcite .",
    "the scientific objectives addressed by the lat include ( i ) determining the nature of the unidentified sources and the origins of the diffuse emission revealed by egret , ( ii ) understanding the mechanisms of particle acceleration operating in celestial sources , particularly in active galactic nuclei , pulsars , supernovae remnants , and the sun , ( iii ) understanding the high - energy behavior of grbs and transients , ( iv ) using @xmath0-ray observations as a probe of dark matter , and ( v ) using high - energy @xmath0-rays to probe the early universe and the cosmic evolution of high - energy sources to @xmath6 .",
    "these objectives are discussed in the context of the lat s measurement capabilities in  [ s3 ] .",
    "to make significant progress in understanding the high - energy sky , the lat , shown in figure  [ f1.1 ] , has good angular resolution for source localization and multi - wavelength studies , high sensitivity over a broad field - of - view to monitor variability and detect transients , good calorimetry over an extended energy band to study spectral breaks and cut - offs , and good calibration and stability for absolute , long term flux measurement .",
    "the lat measures the tracks of the electron ( @xmath7 ) and positron ( @xmath8 ) that result when an incident @xmath0-ray undergoes pair - conversion , preferentially in a thin , high-@xmath5 foil , and measures the energy of the subsequent electromagnetic shower that develops in the telescope s calorimeter .",
    "table  [ t1.1 ] summarizes the scientific performance capabilities of the lat .",
    "figure  [ f1.2 ] illustrates the sensitivity and field - of - view ( fov ) achieved with the lat for exposures on various timescales . to take full advantage of the lat s large fov , the primary observing mode of _ fermi _ is the so - called `` scanning '' mode in which the normal to the front of the instrument ( @xmath9 axis ) on alternate orbits is pointed to @xmath10 from the zenith direction and towards the pole of the orbit and to @xmath11 from the zenith on the subsequent orbit . in this way , after 2 orbits , about 3 hours for _ fermi _ s orbit at @xmath12565 km and @xmath13 inclination , the sky exposure is almost uniform . for particularly interesting targets of opportunity ,",
    "the observatory can be inertially pointed .",
    "details of the lat design and performance are presented in  [ s2 ] .",
    "the lat was developed by an international collaboration with primary hardware and software responsibilities at stanford university , stanford linear accelerator center , agenzia spaziale italiana , commissariat  lenergie atomique , goddard space flight center , istituto nazionale di fisica nucleare , centre national de la recherche scientifique / institut national de physique nuclaire et de physique des particules , hiroshima university , naval research laboratory , ohio state university , royal institute of technology  stockholm , university of california at santa cruz , and university of washington .",
    "other institutions that have made significant contributions to the instrument development include institute of space and astronautical science , stockholm university , university of tokyo , and tokyo institute of science and technology .",
    "all of these institutions as well as the istituto nazionale di astrofisica in italy are making significant contributions to lat data analysis during the science operations phase of the _ fermi _ mission .",
    "the lat is designed to measure the directions , energies , and arrival times of @xmath0-rays incident over a wide fov , while rejecting background from cosmic rays .",
    "first , the design approach @xcite that resulted in the instrument described in detail in  [ s2.2 ] made extensive use of detailed simulations of the detector response to signal ( celestial @xmath0-rays ) and backgrounds ( cosmic rays , albedo @xmath0-rays , etc . ) .",
    "second , detector technologies were chosen that have an extensive history of application in space science and high - energy physics with demonstrated high reliability .",
    "third , relevant test models were built to demonstrate that critical requirements , such as power , efficiency , and detector noise occupancy , could be readily met .",
    "fourth , these detector - system models , including all subsystems , were studied in accelerator test beams to validate both the design and the monte carlo programs used in the simulations @xcite .    the modular design of the lat allowed the construction , at reasonable incremental cost , of a full - scale , fully functional engineering demonstration telescope module for validation of the design concept .",
    "this test engineering model was flown on a high - altitude balloon to demonstrate system level performance in a realistic , harsh background environment @xcite and was subjected to an accelerator beam test program @xcite .",
    "particle beam tests were also done on spare flight tracker and calorimeter modules ( see (  [ s2.5.1 ] ) .",
    "high - energy @xmath0-rays can not be reflected or refracted ; they interact by the conversion of the @xmath0-ray into an @xmath14 pair .",
    "the lat is therefore a pair - conversion telescope with a precision converter - tracker (  [ s2.2.1 ] ) and calorimeter (  [ s2.2.2 ] ) , each consisting of a @xmath1 array of 16 modules supported by a low - mass aluminum grid structure .",
    "a segmented anticoincidence detector ( acd ,  [ s2.2.3 ] ) covers the tracker array , and a programmable trigger and data acquisition system ( daq ,  [ s2.2.4 ] ) utilizes prompt signals available from the tracker , calorimeter , and anticoincidence detector subsystems to form a trigger .",
    "the self - triggering capability of the lat tracker in particular is an important new feature of the lat design that is possible because of the choice of silicon - strip detectors , which do not require an external trigger , for the active elements .",
    "in addition , all of the lat instrument subsystems utilize technologies that do not use consumables such as gas . upon triggering ,",
    "the daq initiates the read out of these 3 subsystems and utilizes on - board event processing to reduce the rate of events transmitted to the ground to a rate compatible with the 1 mbps average downlink available to the lat .",
    "the on - board processing is optimized for rejecting events triggered by cosmic - ray background particles while maximizing the number of events triggered by @xmath0-rays , which are transmitted to the ground .",
    "heat produced by the tracker , calorimeter , and daq electronics is transferred to radiators through heat pipes in the grid .",
    "the overall aspect ratio of the lat tracker ( height / width ) is 0.4 , allowing a large fov sr at 1 gev , where @xmath15 is the effective area of the lat after all analysis cuts for background rejections have been made . ] and ensuring that nearly all pair - conversion events initiated in the tracker will pass into the calorimeter for energy measurement .",
    "the converter - tracker has 16 planes of high-@xmath5 material in which @xmath0-rays incident on the lat can convert to an @xmath14 pair .",
    "the converter planes are interleaved with position - sensitive detectors that record the passage of charged particles , thus measuring the tracks of the particles resulting from pair conversion .",
    "this information is used to reconstruct the directions of the incident @xmath0-rays .",
    "each tracker module has 18 @xmath2 tracking planes , consisting of 2 layers ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) of single - sided silicon strip detectors .",
    "the 16 planes at the top of the tracker are interleaved with high-@xmath5 converter material ( tungsten ) .",
    "figure  [ f2.1 ] shows the completed 16 module tracker array before integration with the acd .",
    "table  [ t2.1 ] is a summary of key parameters of the lat tracker .",
    "see @xcite for a more complete discussion of the tracker design and performance .",
    "we summarize here the features most relevant to the instrument science performance .",
    "the single - sided ssds are ac - coupled , with 384 56-@xmath16 m wide aluminum readout strips spaced at 228 @xmath16 m pitch .",
    "they were produced on @xmath17-intrinsic 15-cm wafers by hamamatsu photonics , and each has an area of 8.95@xmath188.95 @xmath19 , with an inactive area 1 mm wide around the edges , and a thickness of 400 @xmath16 m .",
    "sets of 4 ssds were bonded edge to edge with epoxy and then wire bonded strip to strip to form  ladders , \" such that each amplifier channel sees signals from a 35 cm long strip . each detector layer in a tracker module consists of 4 such ladders spaced apart by 0.2 mm gaps .",
    "the delivered ssd quality was very high , with a bad channel rate less than 0.01% and an average total leakage current of 110 na .",
    "the wafer dicing was accurate to better than 20 @xmath16 m , to allow all of the assembly to be done rapidly with mechanical jigs rather than with optical references .",
    "the support structure for the detectors and converter foil planes is a stack of 19 composite panels , or `` trays , '' supported by carbon - composite sidewalls that also serve to conduct heat to the base of the tracker array .",
    "the tray structure is a low - mass , carbon - composite assembly made of a carbon - carbon closeout , carbon - composite face sheets , and a vented aluminum honeycomb core .",
    "carbon was chosen for its long radiation length , high modulus ( stiffness ) to density ratio , good thermal conductivity , and thermal stability .",
    "the tray - panel structure is about 3 cm thick and is instrumented with converter foils , detectors , and front - end electronics .",
    "all trays are of similar construction , but the top and bottom trays have detectors on only a single face .",
    "the bottom trays include the mechanical and thermal interfaces to the grid , while the top trays support the readout - cable terminations , mechanical lifting attachments , and optical survey retro - reflectors .",
    "trays supporting thick converter foils have stronger face sheets and heavier core material than those supporting thin foils or no foils .",
    "figure  [ f2.2]a shows a flight tracker tray and figure  [ f2.2]b shows a completed tracker module with one sidewall removed .",
    "the strips on the top and bottom of a given tray are parallel , while alternate trays are rotated @xmath20 with respect to each other .",
    "an @xmath2 measurement plane consists of a layer of detectors on the bottom of one tray together with an orthogonal detector layer on the top of the tray just below , with only a 2 mm separation .",
    "the tungsten converter foils in the first 16 planes lie immediately above the upper detector layer in each plane .",
    "the lowest two @xmath2 planes have no tungsten converter material",
    ". the tracker mechanical design emphasizes minimization of dead area within its aperture . to that end",
    ", the readout electronics are mounted on the sides of the trays and interfaced to the detectors around the @xmath20 corner .",
    "one fourth of the readout electronics boards in a single tracker module can be seen in figure  [ f2.2]b .",
    "the interface to the data acquisition and power supplies is made entirely through flat cables constructed as long 4-layer flexible circuits , two of which are visible in figure  [ f2.2]b . as a result , the dead space between the active area of one tracker module and that of its neighbor is only 18 mm .",
    "incident photons preferentially convert in one of the tungsten foils , and the resulting @xmath7 and @xmath8 particles are tracked by the ssds through successive planes .",
    "the pair conversion signature is also used to help reject the much larger background of charged cosmic rays . the high intrinsic efficiency and reliability of this technology",
    "enables straightforward event reconstruction and determination of the direction of the incident photon .    the probability distribution for the reconstructed direction of incident @xmath0-rays from a point source is referred to as the point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "multiple scattering of the @xmath8 and @xmath7 and bremsstrahlung production limit the obtainable resolution . to get optimal results",
    "requires that the @xmath7 and @xmath8 directions be measured immediately following the conversion . at 100 mev",
    "the penalty for missing one of the first hits is about a factor of two in resolution , resulting in large tails in the psf .",
    "figure  [ f2.3 ] summarizes these and other considerations in the tracker design that impact the psf .",
    "in particular , it is important that the silicon - strip detector layers have high efficiency and are held close to the converter foils , that the inactive regions are localized and minimized , and that the passive material is minimized . to minimize missing hits in the first layer following a conversion , the tungsten foils in each plane cover only the active areas of the silicon - strip detectors .",
    "one of the most complex lat design trades was the balance between the need for thin converters , to achieve a good psf at low energy , where the psf is determined primarily by the @xmath12@xmath21 dependence of multiple scattering , versus the need for converter material to maximize the effective area , important at high energy .",
    "the resolution was to divide the tracker into 2 regions , `` front '' and `` back . ''",
    "the front region ( first 12 @xmath2 tracking planes ) has thin converters , each 0.03 radiation lengths thick , to optimize the psf at low energy , while the converters in the back ( 4 @xmath2 planes after the front tracker section ) are @xmath126 times thicker , to maximize the effective area at the expense of less than a factor of two in angular resolution ( at 1 gev ) for photons converting in that region .",
    "instrument simulations show that the sensitivity of the lat to point - sources is approximately balanced between the front and back tracker sections , although this depends on the source spectral characteristics .",
    "the tracker detector performance was achieved with readout electronics designed specifically to meet the lat requirements and implemented with standard commercial technology @xcite .",
    "the system is based on two application specific integrated circuits ( asics ) .",
    "the first asic is a 64-channel mixed - mode amplifier - discriminator chip and the second asic is a digital readout controller . each amplifier - discriminator chip is programmed with a single threshold level , and only a 0 or 1 ( i.e. , a `` hit '' ) is stored for each channel when a trigger is generated .",
    "each channel can buffer up to 4 events , and the system is able to trigger even during readout of the digital data from previous events .",
    "thus the system achieves high throughput and very low deadtime , and the output data stream is compact and contains just the information needed for effective tracking , with @xmath22@xmath23 noise occupancy , and with very little calibration required .",
    "the system also measures and records the time - over - threshold ( tot ) of each layer s trigger output signal , which provides charge - deposition information that is useful for background rejection .",
    "in particular , isolated tracks that start from showers in the calorimeter sometimes range out in the tracker , mimicking a @xmath0-ray conversion .",
    "the tot information is effective for detecting and rejecting such background events because at the termination of such tracks the charge deposition is very large , often resulting in a large tot in the last ssd traversed .",
    "the tracker provides the principal trigger for the lat . each detector layer in each module outputs a logical or of all of its 1536 channels , and a first - level trigger is derived from coincidence of successive layers ( typically 3 @xmath2 planes ) .",
    "there is no detectable coherent noise in the system , such that the coincidence rate from electronics noise is immeasurably small , while the trigger efficiency for charged particles approaches 100% when all layers are considered .",
    "high reliability was a core requirement in the tracker design .",
    "the 16 modules operate independently , providing much redundancy .",
    "similarly , the multi - layer design of each module provides redundancy .",
    "the readout system is also designed to minimize or eliminate the impact of single - point failures .",
    "each tracker layer has two separate readout and control paths , and the 24 amplifier - discriminator chips in each layer can be partitioned between the two paths by remote command .",
    "therefore , failure of a single chip or readout cable would result in the loss of at most only 64 channels .",
    "the primary purposes of the calorimeter are twofold : ( i ) to measure the energy deposition due to the electromagnetic particle shower that results from the @xmath14 pair produced by the incident photon ; and ( ii ) image the shower development profile , thereby providing an important background discriminator and an estimator of the shower energy leakage fluctuations .",
    "each calorimeter module has 96 csi(tl ) crystals , with each crystal of size @xmath24 .",
    "the crystals are optically isolated from each other and are arranged horizontally in 8 layers of 12 crystals each .",
    "the total vertical depth of the calorimeter is 8.6 radiation lengths ( for a total instrument depth of 10.1 radiation lengths ) . each calorimeter module layer is aligned @xmath20 with respect to its neighbors , forming an @xmath2 ( hodoscopic ) array @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f2.4 ] shows schematically the configuration of a calorimeter module and table  [ t2.2 ] is a summary of key parameters of the calorimeter .",
    "the size of the csi crystals is a compromise between electronic channel count and desired segmentation within the calorimeter .",
    "the lateral dimensions of the crystals are comparable to the csi radiation length ( 1.86 cm ) and molire radius ( 3.8 cm ) for electromagnetic showers .",
    "each csi crystal provides 3 spatial coordinates for the energy deposited within : two discrete coordinates from the physical location of the crystal in the array and the third , more precise , coordinate determined by measuring the light yield asymmetry at the ends of the crystal along its long dimension .",
    "this level of segmentation is sufficient to allow spatial imaging of the shower and accurate reconstruction of its direction .",
    "the calorimeter s shower imaging capability and depth enable the high - energy reach of the lat and contribute significantly to background rejection .",
    "in particular , the energy resolution at high energies is achieved through the application of shower leakage corrections .",
    "each crystal element is read out by pin photodiodes , mounted on both ends of the crystal , which measure the scintillation light that is transmitted to each end . the difference in light levels provides a determination of the position of the energy deposition along the csi crystal .",
    "there are two photodiodes at each end of the crystal , a large photodiode with area 147 mm@xmath25 and a small photodiode with area 25 mm@xmath25 , providing two readout channels to cover the large dynamic range of energy deposition in the crystal .",
    "the large photodiodes cover the range 2 mev  1.6 gev , while the small photodiodes cover the range 100 mev  70 gev .",
    "each crystal end has its own front - end electronics and pre - amplifier electronics assembly .",
    "both low and high energy signals go through a pre - amplifier and shaper and then a pair of track and hold circuits with gains differing nominally by a factor of eight .",
    "an energy domain selection circuit routes the best energy measurement through an analog multiplexer to an analog to digital converter .",
    "a calibration charge injection signal can be fed directly to the front end of the pre - amplifiers .",
    "the position resolution achieved by the ratio of light seen at each end of a crystal scales with the deposited energy and ranges from a few millimeters for low energy depositions ( @xmath1210 mev ) to a fraction of a millimeter for large energy depositions ( @xmath261 gev ) .",
    "simple analytic forms are used to convert the light asymmetry into a position ( see figure  [ f2.5 ] ) .",
    "although the calorimeter is only 8.6 radiation lengths deep , the longitudinal segmentation enables energy measurements up to a tev . from the longitudinal shower profile , an unbiased estimate of the initial electron energy",
    "is derived by fitting the measurements to an analytical description of the energy - dependent mean longitudinal profile . except at the low end of the energy range ,",
    "the resulting energy resolution is limited by fluctuations in the shower leakage .",
    "the effectiveness of this procedure was evaluated in beam tests with the flight - like calibration unit at cern .",
    "figure  [ f2.6 ] shows the measured energy loss and the leakage - corrected energy loss in the calorimeter for electron beams of various energies .",
    "further details of the calorimeter are in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "details of the energy reconstruction are discussed in  [ s2.4.2 ] .",
    "the purpose of the acd is to provide charged - particle background rejection ; therefore its main requirement is to have high detection efficiency for charged particles .",
    "the acd is required to provide at least 0.9997 efficiency ( averaged over the acd area ) for detection of singly charged particles entering the field - of - view of the lat .",
    "the lat is designed to measure @xmath0-rays with energies up to at least 300 gev .",
    "the requirement to measure photon energies at this limit leads to the presence of a heavy calorimeter ( @xmath121800 kg ) to absorb enough of the photon - induced shower energy to make this measurement .",
    "the calorimeter mass itself , however , creates a problem we call the backsplash effect : isotropically distributed secondary particles ( mostly 1001000 kev photons ) from the electromagnetic shower created by the incident high - energy photon can compton scatter in the acd and thereby create false veto signals from the recoil electrons .",
    "this effect was present in egret , where the instrument detection efficiency above 10 gev was a factor of at least two or more lower than at 1 gev due to false vetoes caused by backsplash .",
    "a design requirement was established that vetoes created by backsplash ( self - veto ) would reject not more than 20% of otherwise accepted photons at 300 gev . to suppress the backsplash effect , the acd is segmented so that only the acd segment nearby the incident candidate photon may be considered , thereby dramatically reducing the area of acd that can contribute to backsplash @xcite .",
    "in addition , the onboard use of the acd veto signals is disengaged when the energy deposition in the calorimeter is larger than an adjustable preset energy ( 10 to 20 gev ) .",
    "such events are subsequently analyzed using more complex software than can be implemented on board .",
    "numerous trade studies and tests were performed in order to optimize the acd , resulting in the design shown schematically in figure  [ f2.7 ] .",
    "plastic scintillator tiles were chosen as the most reliable , efficient , well - understood , and inexpensive technology , with much previous use in space applications .",
    "scintillation light from each tile is collected by wavelength shifting fibers ( wls ) that are embedded in the scintillator and are coupled to two photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) for redundancy .",
    "this arrangement provides uniformity of light collection that is typically better than 95% over each detector tile , only dropping to @xmath2675% within 12 cm of the tile edges . overall detection efficiency for incident charged particles",
    "is maintained by overlapping scintillator tiles in one dimension . in the other dimension ,",
    "gaps between tiles are covered by flexible scintillating fiber ribbons with @xmath2690% detection efficiency .    to minimize the chance of light leaks due to penetrations of the light - tight wrapping by micrometeoroids and space debris , the acd is completely surrounded by a low - mass micrometeoroid shield ( 0.39 g @xmath27 ) .",
    "all acd electronics and pmts are positioned around the bottom perimeter of the acd , and light is delivered from the tiles and wls fibers by a combination of wavelength - shifting and clear fibers .",
    "the electronics are divided into 12 groups of 18 channels , with each group on a single circuit board .",
    "each of the 12 circuit boards is independent of the other 11 , and has a separate interface to the lat central electronics .",
    "the pmts associated with a single board are powered by a high voltage bias supply ( hvbs ) , with redundant hvbs for each board .",
    "the tile readout has two thresholds : an onboard threshold of about 0.45 mip for the initial rejection of charged particles , and a ground analysis threshold of about 0.30 mip for the final analysis .",
    "further details of the acd design , fabrication , testing , and performance are given by @xcite .",
    "table  [ t2.3 ] is a summary of key parameters of the lat acd .",
    "the data acquisition system ( daq ) collects the data from the other subsystems , implements the multi - level event trigger , provides on - board event processing to run filter algorithms to reduce the number of downlinked events , and provides an on - board science analysis platform to rapidly search for transients .",
    "the daq architecture is hierarchical as shown in figure  [ f2.8 ] . at the lowest level shown ,",
    "each of 16 tower electronics modules ( tems ) provides the interface to the tracker and calorimeter pair in one of the towers .",
    "each tem generates instrument trigger primitives from combinations of tower subsystem ( tracker and calorimeter ) triggers , provides event buffering to support event readout , and communicates with the instrument - level event builder module that is part of the global - trigger / acd - module / signal distribution unit ( gasu ) .",
    "the gasu consists of ( i ) the command response unit ( cru ) that sends and receives commands and distributes the daq clock signal , ( ii ) the global - trigger electronics module ( gem ) that generates lat - wide readout decision signals based on trigger primitives from the tems and the acd , ( iii ) the acd electronics module ( aem ) that performs tasks , much like a tem , for the acd , and ( iv ) the event builder module ( ebm ) that builds complete lat events out of the information provided by the tems and the aem , and sends them to dynamically selected target event processor units ( epus ) .",
    "there are two operating epus to support on - board processing of events with filter algorithms designed to reduce the event rate from 24 khz to @xmath12400 hz that is then downlinked for processing on the ground .",
    "the on - board filters are optimized to remove charged particle background events and maximize the rate of @xmath0-ray triggered events within the total rate that can be downlinked .",
    "finally , the spacecraft interface unit ( siu ) controls the lat and contains the command interface to the spacecraft .",
    "each epu and siu utilizes a rad750 compact pci processor which , when operating at 115.5 mhz , provides 80 to 90 mips .",
    "the instrument flight software runs only on the epus and the siu .",
    "the tems and the gasu hardware have software - controlled trigger configuration and mode registers .",
    "not shown in figure  [ f2.8 ] is the redundancy of the daq system or the lat s power distribution unit ( pdu ) .",
    "there are two primary epus and one redundant epu , one primary siu and one redundant siu , and one primary gasu and one redundant gasu .",
    "the pdu , which is also redundant , controls spacecraft power to the tems , the gasu , and the epus .",
    "the feeds from the spacecraft to the pdu are fully cross - strapped . in turn , the tems control power to the tracker and the calorimeter modules and the gasu controls power to the acd .",
    "power to the sius is directly provided by the spacecraft .",
    "an instrument - level trigger accept message ( tam ) signal is issued by the gem only if the gem logic is satisfied by the input trigger primitives within the ( adjustable ) trigger window width .",
    "the tam signal is sent to each tem and to the aem with no delays . upon receipt of the tam signal , a trigger acknowledge ( tack )",
    "signal with an adjustable delay is sent by the tem to the tracker front - ends and a command , also with an adjustable delay , is sent to the calorimeter front - ends .",
    "the aem sends a signal to the acd front - ends .",
    "the tack causes the entire instrument to be read out ( e.g. , addresses of hit strips in the tracker and tot for each layer in each tracker module , and pulse heights for all 3,072 calorimeter channels and 216 acd channels ) .",
    "any of the tems or the aem can issue a trigger request to the gem .",
    "the time between a particle interaction in the lat that causes an event trigger and the latching of the tracker discriminators is 2.3 to 2.4 @xmath16s , much of this delay due to the analog rise times in the tracker front - end electronics .",
    "similarly , the latching of the analog sample - and - holds for the calorimeter and the acd are delayed ( programmable delay of @xmath122.5 @xmath16s ) until the shaped analog signals peak .",
    "the minimum instrumental dead time per event readout is 26.50 @xmath16s and is the time required to latch the trigger information in the gem and send it from the gem to the ebm . the calorimeter readout can contribute to the dead time if the full four - range cal readout is requested . during readout of any of the instrument , any tem and the aem send a `` busy '' signal to the gem . from these signals , the gem then generates the overall dead time and the system records this information and adds it to the data stream transmitted to the ground .    any of the tems can generate a trigger request in several ways : ( i ) if any tracker channel in the tracker module is over threshold , a trigger request is sent to the module s tem which then checks if a trigger condition is satisfied , typically requiring triggers from 3 @xmath2 planes in a row .",
    "if this condition is satisfied , the tem sends a trigger request to the gem .",
    "( ii ) if a predetermined low - energy ( cal - lo ) or high - energy ( cal - hi ) threshold is exceeded for any crystal in the calorimeter module , a trigger request is sent to the gem .",
    "the prompt acd signals sent to the gem are of two types : ( i ) a discriminated signal ( nominal 0.4 mips threshold ) from each of the 97 scintillators ( 89 tiles and 8 ribbons ) of the acd , used to ( potentially ) veto tracker triggers originating in any one of the sixteen towers , and ( ii ) a high - level discriminated signal ( nominal 20 mips threshold ) generated by highly ionizing heavy nuclei cosmic - rays ( carbon - nitrogen - oxygen or cno ) .",
    "the high - level cno signal is used as a trigger , mostly for energy calibration purposes . during ground testing the cno signal",
    "is only tested through charge injection .",
    "in addition , the gem can logically group tiles and ribbons to form regions of interest ( rois ) for trigger / veto purposes .",
    "an roi can be defined as any combination of the acd tiles and ribbons .",
    "up to 16 rois can be defined through a series of configuration registers .",
    "the roi signal is simply whether any one of the tiles that define the roi is asserted .",
    "finally , non - detector based trigger inputs to the gem are used for calibration and diagnostic purposes .",
    "the gem can utilize ( i ) a periodic signal derived from either the instrument system clock ( nominally running at 20 mhz ) or the 1 pulse - per - second gps spacecraft clock ( accurate to @xmath281.5 @xmath16s ) , and ( ii ) a solicited trigger signal input that allows the instrument to be triggered through operator intervention .",
    "the spacecraft clock is also used to strobe the internal time base of the gem , thus allowing an accurate measurement of the time of an event relative to the spacecraft clock .      the development and validation of a detailed monte carlo simulation of the lat s response to signals ( @xmath0-rays ) and backgrounds ( cosmic - rays , albedo @xmath0-rays , etc . )",
    "has been central to the design and optimization of the lat .",
    "this approach was particularly important for showing that the lat design could achieve the necessary rejection of backgrounds expected in the observatory s orbit .",
    "the instrument simulation was also incorporated into an end - to - end simulation of data flow , starting with an astrophysical model of the @xmath0-ray sky , used to support the pre - launch development of software tools to support scientific data analysis .",
    "figure  [ fx ] summarizes the various components of the instrument simulation , calibration , and data analysis .",
    "the instrument simulation consists of 3 parts : ( i ) particle generation and tracking uses standard particle physics simulators of particle interactions in matter to model the physical interactions of @xmath0-rays and background particle fluxes incident on the lat .",
    "in particular , the simulation of events in the lat is based on the geant4 ( g4 ) monte carlo toolkit @xcite , an object - oriented simulator of the passage of particles through matter .",
    "g4 provides a complete set of tools for detector modeling . in the lat application ,",
    "the simulation is managed by gleam , our implementation of the gaudi software framework @xcite , and so we use only a subset of the g4 tools .",
    "( ii ) for a given simulated event the instrument response ( digitization ) is calculated parametrically based on the energy deposition and location in active detector volumes in the anticoincidence detector , tracker , and calorimeter .",
    "( iii ) from the digitized instrument responses , a set of trigger primitives are computed and a facsimile of the trigger and on - board flight software filter ( see  [ s2.2.4 ] ) is applied to the simulated data stream .",
    "events that emerge from the instrument simulation ( or real data ) then undergo event reconstruction and classification (  [ s2.4 ] ) , followed by background rejection analysis (  [ s2.4.3 ] ) . as discussed in ",
    "[ s2.4.3 ] , the background rejection can be tuned depending on the analysis objectives .",
    "information about the detector geometry and materials is stored in a set of structured xml files .",
    "these files are used by gleam to build a g4 representation of the detector ( and also to provide information about the detector to our event reconstruction packages ) .",
    "the geometry is quite detailed , particularly for the active elements , namely , the tracker silicon strip detectors , csi crystals and diodes of the calorimeter , and anticoincidence detector scintillator tiles and ribbons .",
    "the current implementation has about 54,000 volume elements , of which about 34,000 are active .",
    "g4 contains a full suite of particle interactions with matter , including multiple scattering and delta - ray production for charged particles , pair production and compton scattering for photons , and bremsstrahlung for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and low - energy interaction with atoms , as well as several models of hadronic interactions .",
    "the set of processes implemented is controlled by a `` physics list , '' which allows for considerable flexibility .",
    "in fact , a special version of the model of multiple scattering is used to provide better agreement with our measured data .",
    "detector calibration data ( thresholds , gains , non - uniformities , etc . ) are used to convert the energy deposited in the active elements to instrument signals . for the tracker ,",
    "dead channels are removed from the data at this stage , as well as any signals which would have overflowed the electronic buffers .",
    "( these same effects are taken into account again during event reconstruction , to aid the pattern recognition . )",
    "the event reconstruction processes the raw data from the various subsystems , correlating and unifying them under a unique event hypothesis .",
    "the development of the reconstruction relies heavily on the monte carlo simulation of the events . in the following subsections ,",
    "the basic blocks of the reconstruction are described .",
    "we start with track reconstruction , as it is key to developing the subsequent analysis of the other systems : the found tracks serve as guides as to what should be expected in both the calorimeter as well as the acd for various event types . the analogous reconstruction processing for egret , a spark - chamber pair conversion telescope , which did not benefit from a detailed monte carlo model of the instrument , is described in @xcite .",
    "spatially adjacent hit tracker strips are grouped together , forming clusters , and the coordinates of these clusters are used in the track finding and fitting .",
    "each cluster determines a precise location in @xmath9 as well as either @xmath3 or @xmath4 . because the planes of silicon detectors are arranged in closely spaced orthogonal pairs , both the @xmath3 and @xmath4 determinations can be made , albeit the choice of tracker technology ( single - sided silicon strip detectors ) imposes the ambiguities associated with projective coordinate readout on the initial pairing of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 coordinates when 2 or more particles pass through a detector plane .",
    "this ambiguity is resolved for tracks associated with particles that pass through more than one tracker module . for events with tracks confined to one module",
    ", the coordinate - pairing ambiguity is resolved for @xmath1290% of these events using calorimeter information .",
    "strictly , resolution of the coordinate - pairing ambiguity is only of secondary importance , having primarily to do with background rejection .    at the heart of track - finding algorithms",
    "is a mechanism to generate a track hypothesis .",
    "a track hypothesis is a trajectory ( location and direction ) that can be rejected or accepted based on its consistency with the sensor readouts .",
    "the generation algorithm is combinatoric , with a significant constraint imposed on the number of trial trajectories considered because of the available computing power .",
    "two algorithms , described below , are used .    _ calorimeter - seeded pattern recognition _ ( cspr ) :",
    "for most of the lat science analysis , some energy deposition in the calorimeter is required .",
    "when present , both the centroid and shower axis of the calorimeter energy deposition can be computed using a moments analysis ( see  [ s2.4.2 ] ) in most cases .",
    "the first and most - often selected algorithm is based on the assumption that the energy centroid lies on the trajectory .",
    "the first hit on the hypothesized track , composed of an @xmath2 pair from the layer in the tracker furthest from the calorimeter , is selected at random from the possible @xmath2 pairs . if a subsequent hit is found to be close to the line between the first hit and the location of the energy centroid in the calorimeter , a track hypothesis is generated .",
    "the candidate track is then populated with hits in the intervening layers using an adaptation of kalman fitting ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the process starts from the first hit .",
    "a linear projection is made into the next layer .",
    "the covariance matrix is also propagated to the layer and provides an estimate of the error ellipse that is searched for a hit to add to the track .",
    "the propagation of the covariance matrix includes the complete details of the material crossed , thereby providing an accurate estimate of the error caused by multiple scattering .",
    "if a candidate hit exists in the layer , it is incorporated into the trajectory weighted by the covariance matrices . the procedure is then iterated for subsequent layers , allowing for missing hits in un - instrumented regions .",
    "adding more hits to the track is terminated when more than a specified number of gaps ( planes without hits associated with the track ) have accumulated ( nominally 2 ) .",
    "the whole process is repeated , starting with each possible @xmath2 pair in the furthest plane from the calorimeter and then continued using pairs from closer layers . after a track of sufficient quality is found and at least two layers have been looped over , the process is terminated .",
    "a byproduct of this process is the first kalman fit to the track , providing the @xmath29 , the number of hits , the number of gaps , etc . from these quantities",
    "a track quality parameter is derived and used to order the candidate tracks from `` best '' to `` worst '' .    at high energies ( @xmath261 gev )",
    "the first - hit search is limited to a cone around the direction provided by the calorimeter moments analysis in order to minimize confusion with hits caused by secondary particles generated by backsplash .",
    "the cone angle is narrowed as the energy increases , reflecting the improved directional information provided by the calorimeter .    following the completion of the cspr , only the `` best '' track found is retained .",
    "the biasing caused by the track quality parameters makes this `` the longest , straightest track '' and hence , for @xmath0 conversions , preferentially the higher - energy track of the @xmath14 pair .",
    "the other tracks are discarded .",
    "the hits belonging to the best track are flagged as `` used '' and a second combinatoric algorithm is then invoked .",
    "_ blind search pattern recognition _ ( bspr ) : in this algorithm , calorimeter information is not used for track finding .",
    "events having essentially no energy deposition in the calorimeter are analyzed using this algorithm as well as for subsequent track finding following the stage detailed above .",
    "the same procedure described for the cspr is used , but here the selection of the second hit used to make the initial trajectory is now done at random from the next closest layer to the calorimeter .",
    "the trajectory formed by these two hits is projected into the following layer and if a hit in that layer lies sufficiently close to the projection a trial track is generated .",
    "the mechanism of populating the track candidate with hits follows that used in the cspr , but without any estimation of the energy of the track , the multiple scattering errors are set by assuming a minimum energy ( default : 30 mev ) .",
    "hits are allowed to be shared between tracks if the hit is the first hit on the best track ( two tracks forming a vertex ) or if the cluster size ( number of strips ) is larger than expected for the track already assigned to that hit .",
    "the total number of tracks allowed to be found is limited ( default : 10 ) .",
    "the final track fits must await an improved energy estimate to be made using the best track to aid in estimating the fraction of energy deposited in the calorimeter ( see  [ s2.4.2 ] ) .",
    "once this is done , the energy is apportioned between the first two tracks according to the amount of multiple scattering observed on each .",
    "a subsequent kalman fit is done but without re - populating the tracks with hits .",
    "the final stage of track reconstruction combines tracks into vertices .",
    "the process begins with the best track .",
    "the second track is selected by simply looping over the other tracks in the event .",
    "the distance of closest approach between the best track and the candidate second track is computed and if within a specified distance ( default : 6 mm ) a vertex solution is generated by covariantly combining the parameters of the two tracks .",
    "the @xmath9-axis location ( coordinate along the instrument axis ) of the vertex candidate is selected using the detailed topology of the first hits and is assigned either to be in the center of the preceding tungsten foil radiator , in the silicon detector itself , or within the core material of the tracker tray directly above the first hit .",
    "a quality parameter is created taking into account the @xmath29 for the combination of tracks , the distance of closest approach , etc .",
    "the first track is paired with the second track having the best quality parameter .",
    "these tracks are marked as `` used '' and the next unused track is selected and the process repeated . if a track fails to make a satisfactory vertex it is assigned to a vertex by itself .",
    "thus all tracks are represented by a vertex .",
    "in addition to the `` standard '' vertexing discussed above , an additional improvement is possible if calorimeter information is included . in events where either during the conversion process or immediately thereafter much of the energy is in @xmath0-rays ( due to bremsstrahlung or radiative corrections )",
    ", the charged tracks can point well away from the incident @xmath0-ray direction .",
    "however the location of the conversion point is usually well determined and , when combined with the energy centroid location in the calorimeter , can give a fair estimate of the direction . the `` best '' track as well as",
    "the first vertex are combined covariantly with this direction using weights to apportion the total energy between these directions .",
    "these `` neutral energy '' solutions result in significantly reducing the non - gaussian tails of the psf .",
    "energy reconstruction begins by first applying the appropriate pedestals and gains to the raw digitized signals .",
    "then , for each calorimeter crystal , the signals from the two ends are combined to provide the total energy in the crystal ( independent of location ) and the position along the crystal where the energy was deposited .",
    "the result is an array of energies and locations .",
    "the three - dimensional calorimeter energy centroid is computed along with energy moments ( similar to the moment of inertia , but with energy in place of mass ) .",
    "the shower direction is given by the eigenvector with the smallest eigenvalue .",
    "initially , the overall energy is taken to be the sum of the crystal energies ( `` calenergyraw '' in figure  [ f2.6 ] ) .",
    "further improvements must await the completion of the fitted tracks .",
    "the trajectory provided by the best track ( or best track vertex when available ) is used as input to estimate the energy correction necessary to account for leakage out the sides and back of the calorimeter and through the internal gaps between calorimeter modules .",
    "three different algorithms are applied to each event : a parametric correction ( pc ) based on the barycenter of the shower , a fit to the shower profile ( sp ) taking into account the longitudinal and transverse development of the shower , and a maximum likelihood ( lk ) fit based on the correlations of the overall total energy deposited with the number of hits in the tracker and with the energy seen in the last layer .",
    "because the sp method starts to work beyond 1 gev and the lk method works below 300 gev , only the pc method covers the entire phase space of the lat .",
    "figure  [ f2.6 ] shows the results of the lk method applied to data obtained with electron beams at cern entering the lat calibration unit at an angle of 45@xmath30 to the detector vertical axis .",
    "the energy resolutions obtained vary between 4% at 5 gev and 2% at 196 gev . at low energy ( @xmath12100 mev ) , a significant fraction ( @xmath1250% ) of the energy in a @xmath0 conversion event can be deposited in the tracker and hence the determination of this contribution to the total energy becomes important . for this purpose the tracker is considered to be a sampling calorimeter where the number of hit silicon strips in a tracker layer provides the estimate of the energy deposition at that depth . the total number of hits in the thin radiator section , the thick radiator section and the non - radiator last layers is computed within a cone with an opening angle which decreases as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the apparent energy in the calorimeter .",
    "the `` tracker '' energy is added to the corrected calorimeter energy .",
    "because the pc method gives an energy estimate for all events , it is used to iterate the kalman track fits as mentioned in  [ s2.4.1 ] .",
    "the vast majority of instrument triggers and subsequently downlinked data are background events caused by charged particles as well as earth albedo @xmath0-rays . the task of the hardware trigger is to minimize their effects on the instrumental deadtime associated with reading out the lat .",
    "subsequently the task of the onboard filter is to eliminate a sufficient number of background events without sacrificing celestial @xmath0-ray events such that the resulting data can be transmitted to the ground within the available bandwidth .",
    "the final task is for the analysis on the ground to distinguish between background events and @xmath0-ray events and minimize the impact of backgrounds on @xmath0-ray science .",
    "the combination of these 3 elements reduces the background by a factor of almost @xmath33 while preserving efficiency for @xmath0-rays exceeding 75% . for reference ,",
    "the average cosmic @xmath0-ray event rate in the lat is @xmath122 hz .     [ s2.4.3.1 ] in order to facilitate the development of the on - board triggering and filtering and subsequent event reconstruction and classification algorithms , a model of the background the lat encounters in space has been developed .",
    "as shown in table  [ t2.4 ] , the background model includes cosmic rays and earth albedo @xmath0-rays within the energy range 10 mev to @xmath33 mev .",
    "any particles that might either make non - astrophysical @xmath0-rays and/or need to be rejected as background are included .",
    "the model does not include x - rays or soft @xmath0-rays that might cause individual detectors within the lat to be activated .",
    "the model is meant to be valid outside the radiation belts and the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) ; no particle fluxes from inside the radiation belts are included .",
    "the boundaries of the belts are defined to be where the flux of trapped particles is 1 proton @xmath27 s@xmath34 ( @xmath35 mev ) .",
    "lat does not take data inside the saa .",
    "the fraction of time spent in the saa is 14.6% .",
    "the ams @xcite and bess @xcite experiments provided important and accurate new measurements of the spectra of the protons and alpha particles , the most abundant of the various galactic cosmic - ray ( gcr ) components .",
    "ams made detailed latitude - dependent measurements of the splash and reentrant albedo particles ( @xmath36 and protons ) in the energy range from @xmath12150200 mev up to the cutoff energies where the earth albedo components become lost in the much greater gcr fluxes .",
    "these fluxes will be updated with results from the pamela satellite @xcite .    for albedo fluxes of particles with energies below @xmath12150 mev , inaccessible to the ams and other large instruments , measurements made by nina and nina-2 and a series of russian satellite experiments with an instrument known as mariya",
    "the albedo @xmath0-ray fluxes are taken from a reanalysis of the data collected by egret when the cgro satellite was pointed at the earth .",
    "the model is based on empirical fits to the referenced data .",
    "no time variability is included .",
    "the gcr fluxes are taken to be the same as those observed near solar minimum ( maximum gcr intensities ) .",
    "the albedo fluxes may vary with time and be correlated with the gcr fluxes .",
    "the fluxes as observed by the nina and mariya experiments are used without correcting them for solar cycle variations . while an east - west cutoff variation was included that affects galactic cosmic ray components , all fluxes except albedo protons",
    "are assumed to be isotropic .",
    "the measurements are not complete enough for us to be able to account for variation in parameters such as the zenith angle of the particles or their pitch angles with respect to the local field .",
    "we have attempted to model some the zenith angle dependence for albedo protons , based not on measurements , but on modeling of the albedo @xcite .",
    "further verification and improvement to the model are being done on orbit .",
    "the orbit averaged background fluxes in the model are shown in figure  [ f2.9 ] . for charged particles , these fluxes are integrated over solid angle .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain fluxes per unit solid angle . for galactic cosmic ray components ,",
    "divide by 8.7 sr , the solid angle of the visible sky that is not blocked by the earth at _ fermi _ s orbital altitude . for the albedo components we have taken the reentrant and albedo fluxes to be the same .",
    "[ s2.4.3.2 ] after track reconstruction , vertexing , and energy reconstruction , the events are analyzed to determine the accuracy of the energy determinations , the directional accuracy , and whether they are @xmath0-rays .",
    "all of the estimates are based on classification tree ( ct ) generated probabilities .",
    "this statistical tool was found to give the highest efficiency with the greatest purity , exceeding that which we obtained with either a more traditional cut - based analysis or with neural nets .",
    "our usage of classification trees involves training a modest number of trees ( a few to @xmath1210 ) and averaging over the results .",
    "the trees are `` grown '' by minimizing `` entropy '' as defined in statistics @xcite .",
    "the final energy estimate for each event is made by first dividing the sample up into subsets according to which energy methods were reporting results ( pc+lf+sp , pc+lf , pc+sp , and pc ) .",
    "when more than one energy method is available , the method selected is determined using a ct .",
    "the probability that the selected energy is better than the 1@xmath37 resolution limit is estimated using a second ct .",
    "the subsets are then merged , now with a single `` best '' energy and a probability `` knob '' that can be used to lessen the presence of tails ( both high and low ) in the distribution of reconstructed energies at the expense of effective area .",
    "the analysis sorts the events according to where they occurred in the lat tracker .",
    "( events in the thick radiator portion have about a factor of 2 worse angular resolution due to increased multiple scattering . )",
    "when there is sufficient energy in the calorimeter ( default : @xmath2610 mev ) , the neutral energy solutions are used . if a 2-track vertex is present , a ct determines whether the vertex derived direction or the best track direction is used . as such there are four basic subsets : thin and thick radiator events and vertexed and 1-track events . for each of these subsets the probability that the reconstructed direction is more accurate than the theoretical 68% containment psf is determined using a ct .",
    "the events are re - merged now with a `` best '' direction solution and associated ct - based probability .",
    "this image `` knob '' can be used to limit the long tails often associated with the psfs of @xmath0-ray instruments .",
    "the background rejection is by far the most challenging of all the reconstruction analysis tasks .",
    "this is due to the large phase space covered by the lat and the very low signal - to - noise ratio in the incoming data ( @xmath121:300 for down - linked data ) .",
    "the first task is to eliminate the vast majority of the charged particle flux that enters within the fov using the acd in conjunction with the found tracks .",
    "one can not simply demand that there are no triggers from the acd because high - energy @xmath0-rays generate a considerable amount of back splash , from the shower that develops in the calorimeter , in the form of hard x - rays that can trigger several acd tiles .",
    "consequently only the tiles pointed at by the reconstructed tracks are used to establish a veto by the presence of a signal in excess of @xmath12@xmath38 of a minimum ionization event . because the accuracy of the pointing is energy dependent due to multiple scattering , at low energy ,",
    "only tiles within the vicinity of the track intersection with the acd are used , while at high energy the region is restricted to essentially the one tile being pointed to .",
    "in addition there are several areas in the acd where it is not possible to completely cover the acceptance region ( e.g.  the four vertical edge corners , the screw holes used to mount the tiles , etc . ) .",
    "since these are known locations , tracks pointing at them must also be eliminated . however , these holes are small and account for a few percent of the surface area and reduce the events sample by @xmath222% .",
    "the considerations for rejecting backgrounds involve the detailed topology of the events within the tracker and the overall match of the shower profile in 3d in both the tracker and the calorimeter .",
    "the tracker provides a clear picture of the initial event topology .",
    "for example the identification of a 2-track vertex immediately reduces the background contamination by about an order of magnitude .",
    "however a majority of events above 1 gev do nt contain such a recognizable vertex due to the small opening angle of the @xmath39 pair along the incoming @xmath0-ray direction .",
    "the observation of a significant number of extra hits in close proximity to the track(s ) indicates they are electrons and hence from the conversion of a @xmath0-ray while the presence of unassociated hits or tracks are a strong indicator of background .",
    "these as well as other considerations are used for training background rejection cts .",
    "the final discriminator of background is the identification of an electromagnetic shower .",
    "considerations such as how well the tracker solution points to the calorimeter centroid , how well the directional information from the calorimeter matches that of the track found in the tracker , as well as the width and longitudinal shower profile in the various layers of the calorimeter , are important in discrimination of backgrounds . again the information from the reconstruction is used to train cts and the resulting probability is used to eliminate backgrounds .",
    "the broad range of lat observations and analysis , from grbs to extended diffuse radiation , leads to different optimizations of the event selections and different rates of residual backgrounds .",
    "for example , in analysis of a grb , the relatively small region of the sky as well as the very short time window allow the background rejection cuts to be relaxed relative to an analysis of a diffuse source covering a large portion of the sky .",
    "furthermore a key science attribute for grb observations is the time evolution and the sensitivity of a measurement to rapid time variation scales as the square root of the number of detected burst photons .",
    "the background rejection analysis has been constructed to allow analysis classes to be optimized for specific science topics .",
    "table  [ t2.5 ] lists 3 analysis classes that have been defined based on the backgrounds expected in orbit , current knowledge of the @xmath0-ray sky , and the performance of the lat .",
    "our estimates of lat performance are given in terms of these analysis classes .",
    "common to all of these analysis classes is the rejection of the charged - particle backgrounds entering within the field of view .",
    "the classes are differentiated by an increasingly tighter requirement that the candidate photon events in both the tracker and the calorimeter behave as expected for @xmath0-ray induced electromagnetic showers .",
    "the loosest cuts apply to the transient class , for which the background rejection was set to allow a background rate of @xmath222 hz , estimated using the background model described in ",
    "[ s2.4.3.1 ] , which would result in no more than one background event every 5 sec inside a @xmath40 radius about a source .",
    "the source class was designed so that the residual background contamination was similar to that expected from the extragalactic @xmath0-ray background flux over the entire field of view . finally , the diffuse class has the best background rejection and was designed such that harsher cuts would not significantly improve the signal to noise .",
    "the various analysis cuts and event selections will be optimized for the conditions found on - orbit during the 1st year all - sky survey phase .",
    "note that these 3 analysis classes are hierarchical ; that is all events in the diffuse class are contained in the source class and all events in the source class are in the transient class .",
    "the residuals of background events for the 3 analysis classes are shown in figure  [ f2.10 ] .",
    "for the diffuse class , the resulting rejection factor is @xmath121:@xmath33 at some energies ( e.g. , @xmath1210 gev ) while retaining @xmath2680% efficiency for retaining @xmath0-ray events .",
    "the residual background is worse at low energy particularly for events originating in the thick radiator portion of the tracker .",
    "it is here that `` splash '' backgrounds , entering the backside of the calorimeter can undergo interactions that result in low energy particles which range out in the thick radiators , thus mimicking an event originating in the thick tracker section . in a sense",
    "the thick section shields the thin section from this flux and hence the thin section is somewhat cleaner .",
    "the leaked background events generally fall into two categories : irreducible events and reducible events .",
    "the irreducible events are events in which a background particle interacts in the passive material outside the acd or within the first @xmath121 mm of the acd scintillator and the resulting secondaries contain @xmath0-rays which enter inside the fov .",
    "this can happen in the case of entering @xmath8 which annihilate to two photons , entering @xmath7 or @xmath8 which bremsstrahlung essentially all their energy to a single photon , and proton interactions that make a @xmath41 which decays to 2 photons with the rest of the secondaries either neutral or aimed away from the lat . in these cases",
    "the acd has no signals and a @xmath0-ray is seen in the lat .",
    "there is no way in principle to distinguish and eliminate these events from the celestial @xmath0-ray signal and this component is the result of the reality of contemporary instrumentation and the precautionary measures that must be taken to survive in low earth orbit .",
    "this irreducible component constitutes @xmath1260% of the residual background events with measured energies above 100 mev .",
    "the reducible background component comprises events that in principle should be identifiable .",
    "these events leak through the various filters because they are in the far tails of their parent distributions , overlapping the @xmath0-ray ( signal ) distribution .",
    "the filter parameters are chosen to optimize efficiency for @xmath0-rays versus background rejection .",
    "additional contributions to the reducible background component come from the fact that any real detector will have inefficiencies caused by real world design choices such as gaps in the silicon detector planes of the tracker and in the acd .",
    "this reducible component however is easily monitored by comparing the apparent fluxes of events with and without vertices .",
    "the difference is essentially the reducible component because the vertexed event sample has 10 times fewer such reducible background events .",
    "the performance of the lat is basically determined by the design of the lat hardware , the event reconstruction algorithms ( i.e. , the accuracy and efficiency with which the low - level event information is used to determine energy and direction ) , and event selection algorithms ( i.e. , the efficiency for identifying well reconstructed @xmath0-ray events ) .    figures  [ f2.11 ]  [ f2.15 ] summarize the performance of the lat .",

    "the source sensitivity of course depends not only on the flux of the source but it also depends on the spectrum of the source .",

    "the design of the lat was optimized using monte carlo simulations .",
    "verification of the design and simulations was done with a series of beam tests at the slac , cern and gsi heavy ion accelerator laboratories .",
    "in addition hardware prototypes as well as the flight instrument have been tested using cosmic rays .",
    "the early prototype tests at slac have already been mentioned .",
    "the most extensive beam test was at cern in 2006 .",
    "the cern beams were selected because they cover almost the entire energy range of the lat for on - orbit operations as well as provide large fluxes of hadrons to verify the modeling of background interactions within the lat . because schedule prevented doing beam tests with the entire lat , a calibration unit ( cu ) consisting of two complete tracker and 3 calorimeter modules was assembled .",
    "the cu readout electronics is a copy of the flight instrument data acquisition system .",
    "the cu is also instrumented with several acd scintillator tiles to measure the backsplash response from the calorimeter at high energies .",
    "the overall agreement between the monte carlo simulations of the cu and the beam test data are excellent , including the overall tracker performance and the psf , the backsplash into the acd , and the modeling of hadronic interactions .",
    "the largest discrepancies involve the energy calibration in the calorimeter which was found to be low by @xmath127% .",
    "a much more complete discussion of the preliminary beam test results , comparing the cu to the monte carlo simulations can be found in @xcite .",
    "in addition to the accelerator beam tests , several times during the assembly of the lat , cosmic ray triggers were recorded to verify the proper functioning of the lat modules as they were added to the instrument array .",
    "collection of cosmic - ray data , recorded at a trigger rate of @xmath12400 hz , continued through the environmental testing and pre - launch preparations of the _ fermi _ telescope . while terrestrial cosmic rays are quite messy ( e.g. , multiple particle types , range of arrival directions ) compared to a particle beam from an accelerator , the lat has sufficient power as a particle detector to provide clean samples of sea - level muons , resulting in relatively large samples of muon events that allow precision testing . with these events , calibrations , efficiencies , and alignment issues",
    "were successfully addressed .    the first 60 days after launch were a commissioning period for the _ fermi _ spacecraft and the lat . during part of this period",
    "the lat was subjected to a relatively high rate albedo photon data by pointing at the earth s limb , and directly observed the `` splash '' albedo background component with nadir pointed runs , as well as run with modified triggers to allow high - energy cosmic rays to be efficiently collected to verify alignment and efficiencies that may have been affected during the launch .",
    "the early operations tests included checks of internal timing and absolute timing , subsystem calibrations , characterization of the perimeter of the south atlantic anomaly , tuning the onboard event filters , and commissioning the on - board detection of grbs .",
    "a primary objective of onboard science processing is to provide rapid detection and localization of grbs .",
    "the output of this processing can trigger an autonomous re - pointing of the _ fermi _ to keep the grb within the lat fov for observation of high - energy afterglows and is made available to support follow - up observations of afterglows by other observatories .",
    "the _ fermi _  gamma - ray burst monitor also produces onboard detections and localizations , however for burst that trigger the lat , the lat s better point spread function results in significantly improved localization .",
    "the onboard estimates of the celestial coordinates of the grb and the error region are distributed via the gamma - ray burst coordinate network ( gcn ) .",
    "the onboard science processing consists of algorithms to ( 1 ) select @xmath0-ray candidate events , ( 2 ) reconstruct directions of @xmath0-ray candidate events and ( 3 ) search for and localize high energy transients .",
    "the information available to the onboard grb search algorithm differs substantially from that eventually available on the ground .",
    "the event selection is based on parameters previously calculated for the onboard filter ( described in  [ s2.2.4 ] ) .",
    "the onboard software uses fairly simple , computationally efficient algorithms to calculate the directions of candidate @xmath0-ray events .",
    "the efficiency for successfully reconstructing an event direction is within 25% of what can be achieved with subsequent ground processing however , the reconstructed directions are about a factor of 2 to 5 worse .",
    "the onboard grb detection algorithm utilizes both the temporal and spatial characteristics of grbs .",
    "it works by associating a probability for a cluster of tracks to be located on a small part of the sky during a short interval of time .",
    "@xmath0-ray candidate events with reconstructed directions are fed to the algorithm in time order .",
    "the algorithm searches a list of the @xmath17 most recent events for the cluster of events that has the smallest probability of occurring in time and space .",
    "if the probabilities pass a pre - selected threshold , the time and location of the cluster is passed to a second stage of processing which considers events over a longer time interval .",
    "a grb is declared when cluster probabilities in the second stage exceed a pre - defined threshold .",
    "the algorithm will then calculate refined localizations on a configurable sequence of time intervals . the initial burst location and each updated location",
    "is sent promptly to the ground via the tracking and data relay satellite system ( tdrss ) and then to the gcn ( http://gcn.nasa.gov/ ) .",
    "the gcn provides locations of grbs ( the notices ) detected onboard by the lat or the gbm and reports on follow - up observations ( the circulars and the reports ) made by ground - based and space - based optical , radio , x - ray , tev , and other observers .",
    "triggering on bursts depends on settable parameter choices .",
    "we used a phenomenological burst simulator and background model to guide the initial choice of filter parameter values .",
    "these parameters will be optimized once a large enough sample of bursts has been identified via ground reconstruction .",
    "lat science data arrive at the lat instrument science operations center ( isoc ) from the _ fermi _ mission operations center at about 3 hour ( 2 orbits ) intervals , 24 hours per day , in approximately 1.5 gb downlinked data sets .",
    "automated processing of the data implements several analysis functions .",
    "the primary function is to interpret the event data , via pattern recognition and reconstruction , to indicate the nature of the event as either celestial @xmath0-ray photons or background , and determine the direction , arrival time , and energy and provide estimates of the associated errors . during the process of correlating data from all the subsystems , detailed information is available on the operation of the lat and is collected and trended for monitoring purposes .",
    "once the photons have been isolated , the level-1 data are immediately used to carry out several higher level science analysis tasks that include searching for and refining grb properties ; searching for flaring sources ; and tracking the light curves of a pre - selected list of sources .",
    "the processing pipeline is designed to allow parallel processing of events , with dependencies enabled so that processes can wait for the parallel processing to finish before aggregating the results .",
    "it can process an arbitrary graph of tasks .",
    "the pipeline is run in a java application server and interacts with farms of batch processors .",
    "about 300 hz of downlinked on - orbit data can be processed by 100 computing cores within 1 - 2 hours , allowing processing to finish before the next downlink arrives .",
    "reconstruction inflates the raw science data volume by approximately a factor of 20 .",
    "keeping all events processed requires about 150 tb of disk per year .",
    "the total lat pipeline processing compute facility is sized to accommodate prompt processing , reprocessing and simulations .",
    "300 computing cores for reprocessing of data , allow one year of data to be reprocessed in about one month .",
    "this is an upper limit on the reprocessing time , since use will be made of the much larger user batch processor pool in the slac compute farm .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath0-ray photon events are then made available , along with instrument response functions and high - level analysis tools , etc .",
    ", to the _ fermi _ science support center ( fssc ) for distribution to the community at the conclusion of the first year on - orbit verification and sky - survey phase and during subsequent mission phases .",
    "after completion of the verification and sky survey phase ( year 1 ) of the mission , these data should arrive at the fssc within about 3 - 4 hours after arrival of unprocessed data at the isoc .",
    "automated science processing operates on 3 time scales : per downlink , per week and per month . during year 1 as well as beyond , the isoc will deliver high - level science data products , resulting from automated science processing ( asp ) , to the fssc .",
    "these include light curves and gcn notices and circulars for grbs and agn flares as well as fluxes , source locations and associated errors for transient or flaring sources .",
    "time critical analysis tasks related to detection and characterization of transient sources , referred to as automated science processing ( asp ) , are performed on the reconstructed and classified events from the level-1 pipeline to facilitate timely follow - up observations by other observatories .",
    "the asp tasks relevant to grbs ( and other impulsive phenomena , such as solar flares ) are the refinement of information for grbs that were detected with onboard processing , the search for untriggered grbs , and the rapid search for and characterization of @xmath0-ray afterglow emission . in this context , untriggered",
    "means not triggered by the lat ; however , information about grbs detected by the gbm and gcn notices from other observatories will be used in conjunction with this search . the baseline for asp",
    "processing uses an unbinned likelihood analysis to determine the position and uncertainty of a grb and evaluates the spectral index and fluence by fitting a power - law spectrum to the lat events , also via an unbinned likelihood analysis .",
    "the refinement task uses a bayesian blocks temporal analysis @xcite to characterize the prompt burst light curve , and from that analysis , it determines the burst start time and duration .",
    "the search for untriggered grbs uses an algorithm similar to the one developed for onboard detection ; but since asp analysis uses ground processed events , it benefits from a substantially lower residual background rate as well as from more accurate energy and directional reconstructions . any independently - available information , such as directions and times of grbs seen by other instruments , is used to increase the sensitivity of the search .",
    "the afterglow search uses an unbinned likelihood analysis to fit for a point source at the best - fit grb position using a likelihood analysis on all data available for @xmath125 hours after the time of the grb .",
    "the principal products of asp processing for grbs are notices and circulars released via gcn ; for grb refinements the latency for release of these products will eventually be no more than 15 minutes from the availability of the necessary level-1 data . for grb and afterglow searches the latency will be less than 1 hour .",
    "overall catalogs of lat grbs will be produced by the lat collaboration .",
    "the asp tasks relevant to blazars and other long - term transient sources relate to monitoring for episodes of flaring . for optimum sensitivity",
    "this involves both routinely evaluating the fluxes for a set of sources as well as searching for new transients not already on the list of monitored sources .",
    "the flux monitoring task uses an unbinned likelihood analysis to evaluate the fluxes and upper limits of a specified list of sources on daily and weekly bases .",
    "the asp - monitored source list is not static  bright transients will be added as they are found , for example . the general search for flaring sources , to find transients that are not on the list of sources being monitored , is run on daily and downlink ( @xmath1234 hr ) time scales .",
    "the baseline algorithm for this search monitors for changes in exposure - corrected maps of counts .",
    "newly - detected transients meeting the detection criteria are released via gcn notices or astronomers telegrams ( atels ) .",
    "the latency for updating daily light curves of monitored sources will eventually be less than 6 hours after the availability of the needed level-1 data . the general search for flaring sources is expected to take less than 1 hour per downlink .",
    "the algorithms and event classification cuts used for the asp analyses are continuing to be refined during flight .",
    "the asp processing tasks are built as part of the general pipeline system in the lat isoc , and are extensible as needed .",
    "a parallel set of tasks uses the lat science data for the bright pulsars to validate the instrument response functions and to monitor the high - level performance of the lat .",
    "the lat is designed to address a number of scientific objectives that include ( i ) resolving the @xmath0-ray sky and determining the origins of diffuse emission and the nature of unidentified sources (  [ s3.1 ] ) , ( ii ) understanding the mechanisms of particle acceleration in celestial sources (  [ s3.2 ] ) , ( iii ) studying the high - energy behavior of grbs and transients (  [ s3.3 ] ) , ( iv ) probing the nature of dark matter (  [ s3.4 ] ) , and ( v ) using high - energy @xmath0-rays to probe the early universe (  [ s3.5 ] ) .",
    "the key objectives are largely motivated by the discoveries of egret ( @xmath1230 mev  10 gev ) and of ground - based atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( act ) above @xmath12100 gev .",
    "progress in several areas requires coordinated multi - wavelength observations with both ground and space - based telescopes .",
    "the following sections describe how the lat enables these scientific studies .",
    "high - energy @xmath0-ray sources are seen against a diffuse background of galactic and extragalactic radiation . particularly at low galactic latitudes ,",
    "the diffuse radiation is bright and highly structured .",
    "about 80% of the high - energy luminosity of the milky way comes from processes in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "because these background emissions are themselves not completely understood , analysis is an iterative process .",
    "as sources are discovered and distinguished from the background , the diffuse background model can be improved , thus allowing better analysis of the sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although time signatures allowed identification of many egret sources as pulsars or blazars , in the third egret catalog @xcite 170 of the 271 sources had no firm identifications .",
    "progress towards identifications has been limited primarily by the relatively large egret error boxes that often contain many potential counterparts .",
    "a wide variety of astrophysical objects have been suggested as possible counterparts for some of these sources .",
    "some examples are : newly - found radio or x - ray pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , isolated neutron stars ( e.g. , rx j1836.2 + 5925 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , star forming regions or association of hot and massive stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , supernova remnants ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , pulsar wind nebulae ( e.g .. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and microquasars , such as lsi 61@xmath30303 @xcite .",
    "figure - of - merit approaches have increased the number of @xmath0-ray sources at high galactic latitudes identified , with moderate confidence , with blazars @xcite .",
    "population studies of the unidentified egret sources have also provided clues about their natures .",
    "for example , spatial - statistical considerations and variability studies provide evidence for a population of galactic and variable gev @xmath0-ray emitters among the unidentified egret sources @xcite .",
    "many sources may be related to star - forming sites in the solar neighborhood or a few kiloparsecs away along the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "these sites harbor compact stellar remnants , snrs and massive stars , i.e. , many likely candidate @xmath0-ray emitters .",
    "evidence exists for a correlation with snrs @xcite as well as ob associations @xcite , reviving the snob concept of @xcite or making the pulsar option attractive .",
    "pulsar populations may also explain a large fraction of unidentified sources close to the galactic plane @xcite and possibly in the nearby starburst gould belt @xcite .",
    "other candidate objects among the unidentified sources include radio - quiet neutron star binary systems @xcite and systems with advection - dominated accretion flows onto a black hole such as cygnus x-1 , recently detected as a flaring source by magic @xcite .    with regard to extragalactic sources , understanding the nature of the unidentified sources",
    "is important because new @xmath0-ray emitting source classes ( e.g. , normal galaxies , clusters , etc . ) are likely to be found in addition to the well - established blazars .",
    "a census of these sources is important for establishing their contribution to the extragalactic @xmath0-ray background ( egrb ; see  [ s3.1.3 ] ) .",
    "high - confidence detections and identifications of the first representatives of other extragalactic @xmath0-ray sources , such as galaxy clusters @xcite , will enable comparisons and normalization of theoretical predictions of their contributions to the egrb .",
    "the lat addresses these challenges with good source localization , energy spectral measurement over a broader range , and nearly continuous monitoring of sources for temporal variability .",
    "these capabilities greatly facilitate the source identification process in the following ways :    \\(1 ) _ provide good source localization for the majority of @xmath0-ray sources , including all of the egret detected sources . _ for @xmath43 one - year lat survey sources and for egret sources ( figure  [ f3.1 ] ) , the typical error box sizes ( 68% confidence radius ) are @xmath44 and @xmath22@xmath45 respectively , for an @xmath46 source and @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively , for a source with a spectral cut - off at @xmath123 gev , as anticipated for pulsars .",
    "more precise source locations and smaller positional uncertainties are a prerequisite for more efficient and conclusive source identifications , with the exception of @xmath0-ray variability that is tightly correlated with variability in another band .",
    "small error boxes significantly reduce the number of potential counterparts at other wavebands .",
    "better source localization will also improve spatial - statistical correlation studies by reducing the number of chance coincidences . finally , a number of unidentified egret sources that are likely unresolved composite sources ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) , will be resolved into individual sources .",
    "\\(2 ) _ measure source spectra over a broad energy range .",
    "_ determining @xmath0-ray spectra with the lat s resolution will allow investigation of features intrinsic to the sources such as absorption signatures , spectral breaks , transitions , and cutoffs ( e.g. , attenuation of blazar spectra at high - energy due to @xmath49 in the extragalactic background light ) .",
    "the lat s wide energy coverage will connect the gev sky to ground - based very high energy @xmath0-ray observations .",
    "for example , lat spans the energy range where the pulsed emission component in pulsars appears to fade out ( a few gev ) , to be dominated at higher energies by energetic synchrotron nebulae powered by the pulsar .",
    "\\(3 ) _ measure @xmath0-ray light curves over a broad range of timescales . _ the large effective area , wide field of view , stability , and low readout deadtime of the lat enable measurement of source flux variability over a wide range of timescales .",
    "figure  [ f3.2 ] illustrates this capability .",
    "coupled with the scanning mode of operation , this capability enables continual monitoring of source fluxes that will greatly increase the chances of detecting correlated flux variability with other wavelengths .",
    "it allows periodicity and modulation searches , for example , for orbital modulation in close binaries .",
    "lat sources can be investigated for potential periodicities on time scales of milliseconds to years , encompassing millisecond pulsars , pulsars and binary systems hosting a neutron star . extrapolating from egret analyses of geminga ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the lat sensitivity allows searches in sources as faint as @xmath12@xmath50 photons @xmath27 s@xmath34 ( @xmath51 mev ) without prior knowledge of the period and period derivative from radio , optical , or x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "such a capability is crucial for revealing radio - quiet , geminga - like sources @xcite which are expected to contribute significantly to the galactic unidentified source population @xcite .    in general",
    ", variability can be a discriminator for different source populations , i.e. , expected steadiness in the @xmath0-ray emission in the case of molecular - cloud - related cr interactions , @xmath0-rays from snrs , starburst galaxies , or in galaxy clusters versus modulated or stochastic variable emission from active galactic nuclei , galactic relativistic jet sources , black hole or neutron stars in binary systems with massive stars , and pulsar wind nebulae .",
    "population studies for a prospective source class help to select the most promising individual candidate sources for carrying out deep multi - frequency identification campaigns based on their broadband non - thermal properties and also help with investigating common characteristics of the candidate population . for example , galaxy clusters , as a candidate population , can be characterized by mass as deduced from optical richness , by temperature and mass functions , by applying virial mass - over - distance constraints , and by observational characteristics such as the presence or absence of merger activity , the presence or absence of diffuse radio halos or indications of nonthermal spectral components in the hard - x - rays .",
    "lat observations should allow at least several members among each new candidate source populations to be individually discovered and characterized .",
    "in view of the large number of expected detections , most probably representing different source classes , confirmation of a given population as @xmath0-ray emitters will require a common criteria for statistical assessment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as dedicated multiwavelength observing campaigns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".    given the advance for point - source detection provided by the lat , anticipating new observational features presently unknown in gev astrophysics is also important .",
    "although speculative at present , gev @xmath0-ray phenomena might be found that initially , or ultimately , have no detectable correspondence in other wavebands ( e.g. , gev forming galaxy clusters : @xcite ; dark matter clumps : @xcite ) .",
    "the diffuse emission of the milky way is an intense celestial signal that dominates the @xmath0-ray sky .",
    "the diffuse emission traces energetic particle interactions in the ism , primarily protons and electrons , thus providing information about cosmic - ray spectra and intensities in distant locations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this information is important for studies of cosmic - ray acceleration and propagation in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-rays can be used to trace the interstellar gas independently of other astronomical methods , e.g. , the relation of molecular h@xmath52 gas to co molecule @xcite and hydrogen overlooked by other methods @xcite .",
    "the diffuse emission may also contain signatures of new physics , such as dark matter , or may be used to put restrictions on the parameter space of supersymmetrical particle models and on cosmological models ( see  [ s3.4 ] ) .",
    "the galactic diffuse emission must also be modeled in detail in order to determine the galactic and extragalactic @xmath0-ray backgrounds and hence to build a reliable source catalog .",
    "accounting for the diffuse emission requires first a calculation of the cosmic - ray ( cr ) spectra throughout the galaxy @xcite . a realistic calculation that solves the transport equations for cr species must include gas and source distributions , interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) , nuclear and particle cross sections and nuclear reaction network , @xmath0-ray production processes , and energy losses . finally , the spectrum and spatial distribution of the diffuse @xmath0-rays are the products of cr particle interactions with matter and the isrf .",
    "one of the critical issues for diffuse emission remaining from the egret era is the so - called `` gev excess '' .",
    "this puzzling excess emission above 1 gev relative to that expected @xcite has shown up in all models that are tuned to be consistent with directly measured cosmic - ray nucleon and electron spectra @xcite .",
    "the excess has shown up in all directions , not only in the galactic plane .",
    "the origin of the excess is intensively debated in the literature since its discovery by @xcite .",

    "recent studies of the egret data have concluded that the egret sensitivity above 1 gev has been overestimated @xcite or underestimated @xcite or imply different cosmic - ray energy spectra in other parts of the galaxy compared to the local values @xcite .",
    "if these possibilities are eliminated with high confidence then it may be possible to attribute it to exotic processes , e.g. , dark matter annihilation products @xcite .",
    "see , however , a discussion on limitations in the determination of the diffuse galactic @xmath0-ray emission using egret data and a word of caution in @xcite .    with its combination of good spatial and energy resolution over a broad energy range ,",

    ", the lat will resolve the large magellanic cloud in detail and , in particular , map the massive star - forming region of 30 doradus . by detecting further members among the normal galaxies in our local group , and galaxies with enhanced star formation rates ( e.g. , ultra luminous infrared galaxies and starburst galaxies )",

    "injected either by agns or accelerated by primordial shocks , @xmath0-rays can be produced in @xmath53 interactions via production and decay of neutral pions and from annihilating dm or supersymmetrical particles .",
    "however , weak constraints from measurements of the intercluster magnetic field ranging from 0.1 @xmath16 g to 1 @xmath16 g leave assessments of the total energy content , as well as the relative fraction in relativistic electrons and protons still open to speculation .",
    "the first clear detection of high - energy @xmath0-ray emission from a galaxy cluster will undoubtedly constrain the baryonic particle content as well as the uncertainly in the estimates of the magnetic field , and consequently enable vastly improved modeling of galaxy clusters over the entire electromagnetic spectrum .",

    "the egrb is difficult to disentangle from the intense galactic diffuse foreground ( see previous section ) because it is relatively weak and has a continuum spectrum with no strongly distinguishing features .",

    "@xmath0-ray observations are a direct probe of particle acceleration mechanisms operating in astrophysical systems .",
    "advances with lat observations in our understanding of these non - thermal processes can be anticipated by reference to discoveries made with egret in several important source categories : blazars , pulsars , supernovae remnants , and the sun .      with high - confidence detections of more than 60 agn , almost all of them identified with bl lacs or flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) @xcite ,",
    "egret established blazars as a class of powerful but highly variable @xmath0-ray emitters , in accord with the unified model of agn as supermassive black holes with accretion disks and jets .",
    "although blazars comprise only several per cent of the overall agn population , they largely dominate the high - energy extragalactic sky .",
    "this is because most of the non - thermal power , which arises from relativistic jets that are narrowly beamed and boosted in the forward direction , is emitted in the @xmath0-ray band ( figure  [ f3.3 ] ) , whereas the presumably nearly - isotropic emission from the accretion disk is most luminous at optical , uv , and x - ray energies .",

    "in addition , the duty cycle of flaring of a large number of blazars will be determined with good accuracy .",
    "measurements of the short variability time scale for luminous @xmath0-ray emission will place lower limits on the doppler factor of the jet plasma .",

    "@xmath0-ray flares are most likely related to the dissipation of magnetic accretion energy or extraction of energy from rotating black holes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the conversion process itself is not well understood , and many questions remain about the jets , such as : how are they collimated and confined ? what is the composition of the jet , both in the initial and in the radiative phase ? where does the conversion between the kinetic power of the jet into radiation take place , and how ? what role is played by relativistic hadrons .",
    "there are also questions about the role of the magnetic field , such as whether the total kinetic energy of the jet is , at least initially , dominated by poynting flux .",
    "the first step in answering these questions is to determine the emission mechanisms in order to infer the content of the luminous portions of jets .",
    "this understanding should , in turn , shed light on the jet formation process and its connection to the accreting black hole .",
    "determining the emission mechanisms , whether dominated by synchrotron self - compton , external compton , or hadronic processes , requires sensitive , simultaneous multiwavelength observations .",

    "broadband campaigns have been organized to measure the total jet power as compared with accretion power , and the spectra from these observations should reveal whether a single zone structure is sufficient or whether multiple zones are required .",
    "furthermore , the content of the inner part of the jet will be tightly constrained by broadband x - ray spectra and by temporal correlations between the x - ray and @xmath0-ray variability ; this is because the radiative energy density in the vicinity of black holes in agn can be reliably estimated from contemporaneous broadband data , and this circumnuclear radiation must compton - scatter with all `` cold '' charged particles contained in the jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "photons above 10 gev can probe the era of galaxy formation through absorption by near uv , optical , and near ir extragalactic background light ( ebl ) .",
    "the ebl at ir to uv wavelengths is accumulated radiation from structure and star formation and its subsequent evolution in the universe with the main contributors being the starlight in the optical to uv band , and ir radiation from dust reprocessed starlight ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    since direct measurements of ebl suffer from large systematic uncertainties due to contamination by the bright foreground ( e.g. , interplanetary dust , stars and gas in the milky way , etc .",
    ") , the indirect probe provided by absorption of high - energy @xmath0-rays via pair production ( @xmath58 ) , emitted from blazars , during their propagation in the ebl fields , can be a powerful tool for probing the ebl density .",
    "for example , observations of relatively nearby tev blazars by the hess atmospheric cherenkov telescope @xcite have placed significant limits on the ebl at ir energies in the local universe .",
    "the photon - photon pair production cross section has a pronounced maximum at @xmath81 tev ( 1 ev / eebl ) ( interaction angle averaged ) , close to the pair production threshold .",
    "hence the lat energy range extending to greater than 300 gev is ideal for probing the ebl in the largely unexplored optical - uv band . according to current ebl models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the number of detected @xmath0-ray loud blazars will increase to potentially several thousand sources ( see  [ s3.2.1 ] ) with redshifts up to @xmath84 .",
    "such a large number of sources will be required for a statistically meaningful search for evolutionary behavior of spectral absorption features in bright and hard - spectrum agns .",
    "any of the analysis methods employed requires disentangling source intrinsic opacity effects , particularly if they are evolutionary with redshift , from the absorption due to ebl .",
    "absorption in the local environment of agn but external to the jet radiation fields has been shown to mimic an absorption pattern similar to what is expected from ebl attenuation of @xmath0-rays @xcite , i.e. higher @xmath0-ray opacities from higher redshift sources .",
    "careful source selection and a statistical assessment of the radiation field density at the @xmath0-ray source site will be an integral part of the analysis .",
