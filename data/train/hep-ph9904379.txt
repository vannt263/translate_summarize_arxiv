    "since the new physics contribution to the above decays in the most plausible extensions of the standard theory can not compete with the sm tree - level processes , the determination of these matrix elements is likely to hold , even in the presence of physics beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "further constraints on the ckm matrix arise from the strength of @xmath0 violation in the kaon sector measured by @xmath10 and from the observation of @xmath11@xmath12 mixing , along with the improved experimental lower limit of @xmath13 . within the sm",

    "what follows is a simple method of checking whether or not present experimental data already exclude the possibility of having a real ckm matrix .",
    "let us assume that @xmath6 is real and that the observed @xmath0 violation in the kaon sector arises solely from physics beyond the sm .",
    "the experimental information on @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , together with the unitarity of @xmath6 , allows one to deduce the values for @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , a comparison of these values with those extracted from @xmath1 and @xmath13 measurements enables us to ascertain the viability of a real ckm matrix .",
    "one may be tempted to interpret any incompatibility between the two sets of @xmath14 and @xmath15 values obtained above as an indication that the ckm matrix can not be real . however , the situation is more involved for the following reason . within the sm , @xmath1 and @xmath13",
    "are generated only at one - loop level by the @xmath16-mediated box diagrams , and as a result , physics beyond the sm can significantly contribute to @xmath1 and @xmath13 .",
    "indeed , in many extensions of the standard theory , the same new physics that gives rise to @xmath17 is likely to provide significant contributions to @xmath1 and @xmath13 .    in this paper , we first analyse the somewhat unnatural situation where new physics contributes only to @xmath17 and not to the mass difference in the @xmath4 system .",
    "we show that in this case the currently available data already disfavour a real ckm matrix , thus confirming previous results @xcite .",
    "we then investigate the more plausible situation of a real ckm matrix , with new physics generating @xmath17 and also contributing to @xmath1 and @xmath13 . in this case , as we shall see below , present experimental data are compatible with the scenario of a real ckm matrix .",

    "we first carry out a general analysis of the new physics contribution to @xmath18 transitions ( see , e.g. , ) . the off - diagonal element of the @xmath20 mass matrix can be written as [ mdef ] m_12(b_q)(b_q ) + ( b_q ) =  , where @xmath21 or @xmath22 , and the effective hamiltonian has the form [ fullheff ] = +  .",

    ", our analysis gives the lower bound as [ lower ] > 1- , c_s = _ s^20.8 _ s^2  .",
    "two remarks are in order here .",
    "first , it is important to note that without new physics contributions to @xmath1 and @xmath13 , i.e.  @xmath41 , we obtain from @xmath42 . by using the bound of",
    ", one immediately sees that a real ckm matrix is disfavoured by present experimental data , as also reported in .",
    "second , for @xmath43 but @xmath44 , it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ bound : rho ] ) and ( [ lower ] ) that either negative or positive values for @xmath38 are allowed by current experimental data .",
    "that is , a real ckm matrix is still consistent with the above measurements provided new physics contributes to both the @xmath45 and @xmath11 system .",
    "this section is concerned with the question of how to construct models that naturally lead to a real ckm matrix , within the framework of multi - higgs - doublet models ( mhdms ) .",
    "the most general yukawa couplings in the mhdm are given by the following lagrangian ( in the weak eigenbasis ) [ yukawa : weak ] _y=-_j=1^m(|q_l_j _ j n_r + |q_l_j _ j p_r ) +  , with the left - handed quark doublet @xmath46 and the right - handed quark singlets @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the up- and down - type quarks respectively . @xmath51 and @xmath52 are matrices in flavour space , and the higgs doublets are given by @xmath53 , @xmath54 , with @xmath55 . in order to obtain a real ckm matrix in a natural way , it is particularly important to require @xmath0 invariance of the lagrangian , only spontaneously broken by the vacuum . without loss of generality",
    ", we may therefore assume that the above yukawa matrices are real , while the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the neutral higgs fields are given by @xmath56 , with @xmath57 .",
    "defining the hermitian matrices [ hu ] h_u & & m_u m_u^ = \\{_i v_i^2_i_i^t + _ j >",
    "iv_i v_j }  , and [ hd ] h_d & & m_d m_d^ = \\{_i v_i^2_i_i^t + _ j > iv_i v_j }  , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the non - diagonal up- and down - type mass matrices respectively , one can show that within the three - generation sm a necessary and sufficient condition for @xmath0 invariance in the charged gauge interactions is given by @xcite [ condition ] t^3=0  .",
    "note that this is independent of the number of higgs doublets which generate masses for the fermions .",
    "hence , @xmath60 implies @xmath0 violation mediated by charged gauge interactions , while @xmath61 guarantees a real ckm matrix .    from it",
    "is evident that the simplest and most natural way of obtaining a real ckm matrix ( i.e. without any fine - tuning ) is by introducing additional symmetries with the effect that [ relation : gamma ] _",
    "i_j^t = _ j_i^t  .",
    "various multi - higgs - doublet models where the condition in is satisfied as a result of a discrete symmetry have been discussed in the literature .",
    "for example , the simplest models belonging to this class contain two higgs doublets and a @xmath62 symmetry @xcite or three higgs doublets and a @xmath63 symmetry @xcite . in these models , there are flavour - changing neutral currents and the vacuum leads to spontaneous @xmath0 violation , but the ckm matrix is real as a result of the discrete symmetry .",
    "the supersymmetric sm with spontaneous @xmath0 violation ( scpv ) is another example where the ckm matrix is real provided that only two higgs doublets are introduced . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) ,",
    "the tree - level vacua are all @xmath0 conserving so that scpv can only occur if radiative corrections to the higgs potential are taken into account .",
    "this inevitably leads to a mass of the lightest neutral higgs boson which has already been ruled out by experiment @xcite . on the other hand , in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) with one or more singlet fields in addition to the two doublets @xcite",
    ", scpv can occur even at tree level . whether or not this scenario is still consistent with present experimental bounds on the higgs mass",
    "depends on the specific model , and we refer the interested reader to .",
    "the important point to emphasize is that in the supersymmetric sm , provided there are only two higgs doublets , but allowing for an arbitrary number of singlets , the ckm matrix is real , even if there is a physically meaningful relative phase between the vevs of the two doublets .",
    "this can be readily verified by noting that the above phase can be eliminated from the quark mixing matrix @xcite .",
    "for definiteness , we will consider a minimal extension of the sm with scpv and a real ckm matrix as a result of a @xmath62 symmetry @xcite .",
    "our main aim is to show that , within the framework of a specific two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) , it is possible to have a real ckm matrix in a natural way , with @xmath17 and @xmath1 generated by physics beyond the sm , while taking into account the constraints discussed in . as we shall see below , @xmath0 violation arises solely from the exchange of neutral higgs bosons , thereby inducing flavour - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) interactions at tree level .",
    "we start with the mass matrices @xmath58 and @xmath59 which can be diagonalized by means of a biunitary transformation , namely p_lv_l^u u_l , n_lv_l^d d_l , p_rv_r^u u_r , n_rv_r^d d_r  , so that [ massmatrix ] m_d^= v_l^dm_d v_r^d , m_u^= v_l^um_u v_r^u  , where m_u= ( v_1 _ 1 + v_2 e^-i _ 2 ) , m_d= ( v_1 _ 1 + v_2 e^i_2 )  .    in order to obtain the physical higgs fields , it is useful to parametrize @xmath64 and @xmath65 in as follows _ 1= (    c _",

    "2= (    c _",
    "2^+ + v_2 + _ 2+i _ 2    ) .",
    "the pseudo - goldstone bosons @xmath66 and @xmath67 in our model can then be found by introducing new bases , i.e. (    cg^+ + h^+    ) = o (    c_1^+ + _",
    "2^+    ) , (    cg^0 + i    ) = o (    c_1 + _ 2    ) , (    ch^0 + r    ) = o (    c_1 + _ 2    ) , with o= (    lrv_1 & v_2 + v_2 & -v_1    )  . the mass matrix of the neutral higgs fields is diagonalized through an orthogonal matrix @xmath68 relating @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 to the mass eigenstates @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) via the relations h^0 = _",

    "i=1 ^ 3 u_3ih_i  .",

    "the crucial point here is that the mass matrix @xmath59 , given in , is in general not a hermitian matrix and consequently @xmath92 , which in turn implies that @xmath93 is unrelated to @xmath6 . as a result",
    ", the @xmath87 above can be taken as free parameters , constrained only by condition ( [ beta : constraint ] ) .",
    "this is an important feature because the strength of the neutral higgs contributions to @xmath19 and @xmath94 ( see below ) are proportional to @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively .",

    "a few remarks are in order here .",
    "first of all , it can be readily shown that @xcite [ cotalpha ] _",
    "i=1 ^ 3  .",
    "second , an analysis of the higgs potential shows that in the limit of an exact @xmath62 symmetry , the vacuum does not violate @xmath0 and the minimum of the potential is at @xmath109 , so that @xmath110 . allowing only a soft breaking of the @xmath62 symmetry by a dimension - two term in the higgs potential , spontaneous @xmath0 violation",
    "can be generated @xcite .",
    "this in turn implies that one may have @xmath111 in a natural way ( in the sense of t hooft @xcite ) , since the limit @xmath110 corresponds to the restoration of an exact @xmath62 symmetry of the lagrangian .",
    "this is the mechanism proposed by branco and rebelo @xcite in order to naturally suppress the strength of @xmath0 violation .",
    "therefore , the limit of , which is due to the @xmath17 measurement , does not necessarily imply very large values of the higgs mass . on the other hand",
    ", we do not consider any accidental cancellation between the elements @xmath112 and @xmath113 appearing in because it would require additional fine - tuning of the parameters in the higgs potential .",
    "furthermore , we should emphasize here that there are also contributions from box diagrams with @xmath16-boson and non - sm charged higgs particle exchange , as well as long - distance contributions , which affect only the _ real part _ of @xmath114 .",
    "thus the most stringent limit on @xmath115 comes from the experimentally measured value of @xmath19 , resulting in the upper bound of .",
    "so , taking @xmath116 to be of order unity , the higgs masses have to satisfy @xmath117 , whereas if we assume @xmath118 , then it is sufficient to demand that @xmath119 .    turning to the @xmath4 system",
    ", the mass difference is given by [ massdiff : b ] m_b_q= 2|m_12^q|,q= d , s  , which is valid for @xmath120 .",
    "recall from that , in order for a model with a real ckm matrix to be consistent with present experimental data , a new physics contribution to @xmath1 equalling at least @xmath2 of the sm contribution is necessary when @xmath121 .",
    "it can be shown that such a new contribution due to @xmath122 can be obtained in our model , while satisfying the bound of . in fact , using eqs .",
    "( [ m12:bd ] ) , ( [ replacement ] ) , ( [ m12:knew ] ) , ( [ m12:gen ] ) , and ( [ massdiff : b ] ) , as well as central values for the various input parameters , one finds that even @xmath123 yields the necessary new physics contribution to @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , it is clear from the preceding discussion that there is a relation between @xmath124 and @xmath31 in the above 2hdm . indeed , employing , and ( [ massdiff : b ] ) , we obtain [ bsys : sintheta ] 2_d = 2|_k| ( ) ^3()^2 ( ) ^2  , and taking @xmath125 , @xmath126 , we estimate [ beta : bounds ] ( ) ^27.4  .",
    "we see that , due to the enhancement factor of @xmath127 in , @xmath0 violation in @xmath11-meson decays is not necessarily small . before proceeding to discuss the @xmath0 asymmetries",
    ", we should mention that a more complete analysis of @xmath0 violation and physics beyond the sm has to take into account the recent measurement of @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "however , as pointed out by buchalla  @xcite in the context of a specific 2hdm , a thorough investigation of the various contributions to direct @xmath0 violation in kaon decays , including renormalization group effects , is more involved and beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we now turn to a study of the @xmath0 asymmetries . due to the fact that the new physics contribution has a complex phase , the @xmath0 asymmetries in different @xmath4-meson decay channels",

    "we should emphasize that this result is a special feature of multi - higgs - doublet models in which the ckm phase is absent , provided the new physics contributions can not compete with the @xmath16-mediated tree diagrams of the sm .",

    "once the two asymmetries @xmath133 and @xmath135 are measured , will provide a clear test of the class of models where @xmath0 violation arises exclusively from flavour - changing neutral higgs exchange .",
    "one of the fundamental open questions in particle physics concerns the origin of @xmath0 violation . in particular , it is crucial to verify whether charged weak interactions violate @xmath0 or not .",

    "this includes the supersymmetric sm with spontaneous @xmath0 violation , which has a real ckm matrix provided that only two standard higgs doublets are introduced , apart from an arbitrary number of higgs singlets .",
    "it is worth mentioning that within the supersymmetric sm it is possible to have the required additional contribution to @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the assumption of spontaneous @xmath0 violation plays an extremely important role when the naturalness of a real ckm matrix is studied . for illustration ,",
    "we have investigated a specific two - higgs - doublet model where @xmath0 is spontaneously broken and the ckm matrix is real as a result of a @xmath62 symmetry .",
    "in fact , we have shown that one can generate @xmath17 with simultaneous contributions to @xmath136 and obtain a good fit to the data .",
    "we are eagerly awaiting the upcoming experiments at the various @xmath4 factory facilities which will provide further constraints on the standard mechanism of @xmath0 violation as well as on alternative scenarios of @xmath0 breaking .",
