    "the kondo - lattice model ( klm)@xcite describes the interplay of itinerant electrons in a partially filled conduction band with quantum - mechanical spins ( magnetic moments ) localized at certain lattice sites .",

    "we restrict our considerations in the following to the @xmath21 case , sometimes referred to as ",
    "ferromagnetic kondo - lattice model  , and also known as  @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) model  .",
    "the applications of the klm are manifold . in the 1970s",
    "it was extensively used to describe the electronic and magneto - optic properties of magnetic semiconductors such as the ferromagnetic euo and eus @xcite .",
    "most studies focussed on the spectacular temperature dependence of the unoccupied band states . the well - known  red shift  of the optical absorption edge upon cooling from @xmath25 to @xmath26 k@xcite can be understood as a corresponding temperature shift of the lower @xmath27 conduction - band edge .",
    "recent quasiparticle band - structure calculation for bulk euo@xcite confirm the observed striking temperature dependence as a consequence of a ferromagnetic exchange @xmath1 of the order of some tenth an ev .",
    "the interest in euo , in particular in thin films , was strongly revived by the observation of a temperature driven metal - insulator transition below @xmath6 with a large drop of the resistivity by as much as eight orders of magnitude@xcite .",
    "this gives rise to a colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) much stronger than that of the manganites as la@xmath28sr@xmath29mno@xmath30 .",
    "recently , a surface half - metal - insulator transition was predicted@xcite for a eu(100 ) film .",
    "the reason for this is an exchange - split surface state .    in ferromagnetic local moment metals like",
    "gd a rkky - type interaction is believed to cause the ferromagnetic order , so that in principle a self - consistent description of magnetic and electronic properties by the klm is possible .",

    "@xmath32 stems from the exactly half - filled @xmath33 shell .",
    "the excess moment of @xmath34 is due to an induced spin polarization of the  a priori  nonmagnetic ( @xmath35 ) conduction - bands , indicating a weak or intermediate @xmath21@xcite .",
    "an interesting application of the klm refers to semimagnetic semiconductors , where randomly distributed mn@xmath36 or fe@xmath36 ions provide localized magnetic moments which influence , via the exchange coupling @xmath1 , the band states of systems like ga@xmath28mn@xmath29as@xcite .",
    "the mn@xmath36 ions provide both localized spins ( @xmath37 , concentration @xmath38 ) and free carriers ( holes , concentration @xmath39 ) .",

    "the origin of ferromagnetism in ga@xmath28mn@xmath29as is controversial .",
    "the authors of ref .   claimed that the measured @xmath44 is consistent with a conventional rkky interaction between the mn ions .",
    "however , they estimated the exchange coupling @xmath1 to be of several ev , therewith comparable to the fermi energy .",
    "this makes second order perturbation theory with respect to @xmath1 rather questionable .",
    "rkky should be modified to account for higher - order spin polarization terms . in this papar",
    "we are going to present a respective proposal .",
    "another modern application of the @xmath21 klm aims at the manganese oxides with perovskite structures t@xmath28d@xmath29mno@xmath30 ( t = la , pr , nd ; d = sr , ca , ba , pb ) which have attracted great scientific interest because of their cmr@xcite .",

    "many fascinating features of the cmr materials can be traced back to an intimate correlation between magnetic and electronic components .",
    "one of the not yet fully understood features concerns the spin dynamics in the ferromagnetic phase ( @xmath59 in la@xmath28(ca , pb)@xmath29mno@xmath30 ) .",
    "it was reported@xcite that the spin wave dispersion ( swd ) of materials with high @xmath6 ( e.g. : la@xmath60pb@xmath61mno@xmath46 : @xmath62 ) can be reasonably reproduced by a simple heisenberg model with nearest - neighbour exchange , only .",
    "furukawa@xcite gave qualitative arguments that this can be understood for strongly exchange coupled materials .",
    "however , strong deviations from the typical heisenberg behavior of the swd have been found for manganites with lower @xmath6s@xcite .",
    "it is a challenging question whether or not the softening of the swd at the zone boundary can be explained by a better treatment of the klm , i.e.  by an appropriate consideration of the influence of the conduction - electron self - energy on the effective coupling between the localized magnetic moments@xcite .",
    "solovyev and terakura@xcite argue in such a way claiming that the swd - softening has a purely magnetic background .",
    "by contrast , mancini et  al.@xcite believe that the klm [ eq .",
    "( [ sn : eq : hamil ] ) ] has to be extended by a direct ( superexchange ) interaction between the mn moments to account for antiferromagnetic tendencies , which dominate the magnetic behaviour of the parent material lamno@xmath30 .",

    "( [ sn : eq : hamil ] ) ] provokes such a complicated many - body problem that approximations have to be tolerated .",
    "most of the recent theoretical work on the klm , aiming at the cmr - materials , assumed classical spins@xcite , mainly in order to apply  dynamical mean field theory ",
    "it is surely not unfair to consider this assumption as rather problematic .",

    "( [ sn : eq : hsfa ] ) ] to the heisenberg model hamiltonian .",
    "this is done by averaging out the conduction electron degrees of freedom by properly defined  restricted  green functions .",
    "the resulting effective heisenberg exchange integrals are functionals of the itinerant - electron self - energy , and therewith strongly temperature and band occupation dependent .",
    "these dependencies manifest themselves in fundamental magnetic properties such as phase diagrams , curie temperature , spin - wave dispersions and so on .",
    "the electronic self - energy is taken from a  moment conserving decoupling approach ",
