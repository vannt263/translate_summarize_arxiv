    "the importance of the global hydrodynamics was demonstrated by @xcite , who simulated pulsar rotational irregularities in the laboratory by impulsively accelerating rotating containers of he ii , obtaining qualitative agreement with radio timing data ( e.g. glitch amplitudes and post - glitch relaxation times ) .    in this paper",

    "however , the numerical results presented in  [ sec : vtmodel ] and  [ sec : rotevol ] are obtained after several ekman times ( and hence rotation periods ) have elapsed , by which time the flow has forgotten its initial conditions , as in most astrophysical applications .    many existing glitch models are based on cylindrical geometries @xcite , except for a few experiments with spheres @xcite . however , the global flow pattern in spherical couette flow differs from its cylindrical counterpart in two important ways .",
    "first , in a cylinder , the principal flow is toroidal , whereas , in a sphere , the principal flow is an axisymmetric combination of toroidal flow and meridional circulation for all @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "second , it is misleading to approximate the equatorial region of a sphere by a cylinder , even for @xmath65 ; the curvature , although slight , causes significant differences in the critical taylor number at which vortices appear @xcite .",
    "the differences between cylindrical and spherical couette flow are equally prominent in classical fluids and superfluids @xcite .",
    "spherical couette flow of a viscous fluid is controlled by three parameters : the reynolds number @xmath66 , the dimensionless gap width @xmath67 , and the angular shear @xmath68 .",
    "if a superfluid is also introduced , @xmath35 emerges as an additional parameter . in the laminar regime ( @xmath69 )",
    ", the global flow can be classified according to the number of cells of meridional circulation in each hemisphere . in a narrow gap ( @xmath70 ) ,",
    "the meridional circulation is slow and can be approximated by @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "as @xmath64 increases , a centrifugal instability generates toroidal taylor vortices near the equator until , at the onset of turbulence ( @xmath72 ) , a helical traveling wave develops . in a wide gap ( @xmath73 ) , by contrast , all secondary flows are nonaxisymmetric , and they oscillate when @xmath64 exceeds a threshold @xcite .",
    "in classical fluids , these flows have been thoroughly investigated numerically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "recently , high - resolution numerical simulations of superfluid spherical couette flow were performed successfully for the first time @xcite .",

    "both components exhibit a similar structure in each hemisphere : a  square \" ekman cell near the pole , three to four secondary meridional cells , a number of smaller cells , and two equatorial vortices near the outer boundary which are created and destroyed intermittently .",
    "we emphasize that the normal component is not assumed to be in uniform ( solid body ) rotation ; it is affected by the superfluid ( through mutual friction ) and the boundary conditions ( differential rotation ) .",
    "figures [ fig : fig1]c and [ fig : fig1]d display streamlines for a run with identical parameters and gm mutual friction , for which the inter - fluid coupling is @xmath46 times smaller , as noted in ",
    "[ sec : hvbkt1 ] .",
    "we observe that the normal fluid exhibits a similar number of vortical structures , which are better developed and more regular than in figure [ fig : fig1]a , and the superfluid flow pattern is nearly unchanged from figure [ fig : fig1]b .",

    "in this section , we investigate how the vorticity state of the outer core changes before , during , and after a glitch , in the context of a generic glitch scenario where the trigger mechanism of the glitch is unspecified .",
    "laboratory experiments on the attenuation of second sound in narrow channels @xcite , and numerical simulations based on the vortex filament method @xcite , show that , in a rotating container of he ii , an axial ( along @xmath53 ) counterflow @xmath80 excites growing kelvin waves which destabilize a rectilinear vortex array @xcite .",
    "the kelvin waves grow exponentially until reconnection between adjacent vortices occurs , generating a dense tangle . for typical neutron star parameters ,",
    "one finds @xmath81 taking @xmath82 .",
    "the axial component of the ekman counterflow in the outer core of a typical neutron star generally exceeds the instability threshold ( [ eq : dgi ] ) .",
    "this is illustrated by figure [ fig : fig2 ] , a greyscale plot of @xmath83 ; the dgi is active in regions with @xmath84 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2]a corresponds to hv mutual friction ( initially rectilinear vortex array ) ; figure [ fig : fig2]b corresponds to gm mutual friction ( after a tangle forms ) . in both figures",
    ", the dgi is active in most of the computational domain , implying that _ an initially rectilinear array is disrupted and , once disrupted , stays that way_. this result is extracted empirically from the simulations .",
    "the inclusion of compressibility and hence stratification @xcite restricts the dgi region to a thin boundary layer , but the overall conclusion is the same ( see  [ sec : strat ] ) .    the axial counterflow that excites the dgi is driven by ekman pumping .",
    "as the crust spins down electromagnetically at a rate @xmath85 , differential rotation builds up between the crust and outer core , with @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the time elapsed since the last glitch @xcite .",
    "the differential rotation induces meridional circulation @xcite : an ekman boundary layer , with @xmath88 , develops on a time - scale @xmath89 , and grows radially to a thickness @xmath90 cm on a time scale @xmath91 , spinning up the interior fluid @xcite .",
    "only the normal fluid is ekman pumped directly ; the superfluid is spun up by the normal fluid through the mutual friction force @xcite .    in order to estimate the counterflow velocity ,",
    "we compute @xmath92 empirically from numerical experiments and scale up the results to neutron star parameters .",
    "for example , in a typical set of runs with @xmath75 ( hv mutual friction ) , @xmath93 ( hv mutual friction ) , and @xmath94 ( gm mutual friction ) , and @xmath95 , we find @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively , on average over the grid , implying @xmath99 , as a general rule and hence @xmath100    in a typical neutron star , the reynolds number in the outer core ( temperature @xmath101 ) is very large , viz .",
    "@xmath102    given the standard viscosity @xmath13 resulting from electron - electron scattering @xcite .",
    "consequently , the flow is likely to be turbulent @xcite .",
    "our numerical simulations can not access this regime due to computational limitations @xcite .",
    "however , we know from laboratory experiments with he ii that the flow at @xmath103 closely resembles classical , navier - stokes turbulence : the superfluid and normal fluid vorticity evolve in concert , because the vortex lines are locked to the normal fluid eddies by mutual friction @xcite .",
    "@xmath104 @xcite , comparable to that in a neutron star , viz .",
    "@xmath105 @xmath104 @xcite . ]    for the dgi to be triggered in superfluid turbulence , two conditions must be met .",
    "first , there must be vortex segments directed parallel to the counterflow , i.e. @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "as the superfluid is locked to the normal fluid , and the vortex density is high , the condition @xmath106 is satisfied locally throughout the core .",
    "second , a vortex segment is locally unstable to ( helical ) kelvin wave perturbations of wavelength @xmath107 if the local counterflow exceeds the critical speed @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "large wavelengths ( of the order of the size of the star ) are most unstable , with @xmath109 cm giving @xmath110 cm s@xmath111 . in this regard ,",
    "the dgi threshold ( [ eq : dgi ] ) is conservative ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "grows if the vacillation frequency @xmath113 is mantained over a time - scale @xmath114 @xcite . ]      during a glitch event , the differential rotation instantaneously shuts off and the tangle starts to decay . in a self - sustaining vortex tangle , kelvin waves grow until their amplitude approaches the average vortex separation , whereupon the vortex lines continuously reconnect to form loops @xcite .",
    "reconnection stops once the counterflow ceases , as happens immediately after a glitch , when the outer core and inner crust come into corotation ( @xmath115 ) .",

    "the evolution is qualitatively similar in all the cases considered .",
    "there is an initial transient , in which the flow adjusts to the initial spin up on a time - scale @xmath219 , just like in the classical ( viscous ) spin - up problem @xcite .",
    "the fractional torque deviation , @xmath220 , is plotted as a function of time in figures [ fig : fig6]a[fig : fig6]d .",
    "an initial jump , coinciding with the sudden spin up , is observed in all the panels , followed by a rapid exponential decay and persistent , small - amplitude oscillations .",

    "in contrast , in the inverse experiment , where the mutual friction changes from hv to gm , @xcite observed that @xmath226 is almost constant after the post - glitch transient . the period of the oscillations does not change with @xmath87 for @xmath227 .",

    "the evolution is qualitatively similar in both cases , displaying oscillations with the same periodicity and similar amplitude , but the curves diverge for @xmath228 as the viscous fluid evolves more rapidly to a stationary state , driven by classical ekman pumping .",
    "classical theory predicts a time - scale @xmath229 in the limit where the rossby number @xmath185 vanishes ; an exponential fit to the dashed curve gives @xmath230 , which agrees well given that we have @xmath231 in our numerical experiments . in a superfluid , on the other hand",

    "the classical viscous fluid and constant gm friction evolve similarly .",
    "the torque decays exponentially on a time - scale @xmath235 , then decays almost linearly with @xmath87 . by contrast , in the gm @xmath176 hv transition , the torque decays exponentially , on a time - scale @xmath236 , then oscillates with peak - to - peak amplitude @xmath237 ( in units of @xmath238 ) and period @xmath239 . in other words ,",
    "the oscillations are sustained by the hv friction , which is much weaker than its gm counterpart .",
    "note that the oscillations do not correspond to tkachenko waves , since the hvbk equations assume that the free energy of the vortex array depends only on the vortex line density , not on vortex lattice deformations @xcite .",
    "the meridional streamlines for the transitions described in the previous paragraph evolve as in figure [ fig : figc ] .",
    "figures [ fig : figc]a[fig : figc]b show the streamlines for a classic viscous fluid before ( @xmath196 ) and after ( @xmath240 ) the glitch .",
    "there is a rapid redistribution of vorticity near the outer sphere , with two circulation cells replaced by one elongated meridional shell , while the flow near the inner sphere hardly changes , with one circulation cell near the equator and one near the pole .",
    "figures [ fig : figc]c[fig : figc]d show the meridional streamlines for the normal component of the superfluid .",
    "the flow resembles a classical viscous fluid ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : figc]a ) , although it does become more complex after the spin up .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : figc]d , the large cell near the outer sphere is replaced by one primary circulation cell and three secondary cells ( including one near the poles ) .",
    "note that the greatest contributions to the torque come from the mid - latitude regions where the structure of eddies and counter - eddies is richer , as in figure [ fig : figc]d .",
    "finally , in figures [ fig : figc]e[fig : figc]f , we see the meridional streamlines for the inviscid component of the superfluid . the pattern before the jump ( figure [ fig : figc]e ) differs from the normal fluid",
    "; the gm friction creates additional eddies near the outer sphere and closer to the poles .",
    "however , after the transition to hv friction , the inviscid component comes to resemble the normal component , as can be seen by comparing figure [ fig : figc]f with figure [ fig : figc]d .",
    "this occurs because the two components are coupled more strongly by hv friction ( @xmath204 ) , so that the superfluid is dragged along by the normal fluid .",
    "gravitational stratification can strongly suppress ekman pumping , as the ekman layer is squashed close to the outer sphere @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the ekman layer , however thin , always exists , in order to satisfy the boundary conditions at @xmath241 .",
    "it contains a meridional counterflow given by equation ( [ eq : vns_ep ] ) .",
    "consequently , the transition from turbulent to laminar vorticity ( and vice versa ) , which relies on such a meridional counterflow , still occurs in a stratified star , and its dramatic effect on the torque is the same .",
    "the ekman layer , no matter how thin , acts like a film of  oil \" between two sliding surfaces ( here , the outer core and inner crust ) , whose coupling strength (  stickiness \" ) changes abruptly when the meridional speed of the  oil \" exceeds a threshold . in other words , equations (",
    "[ eq : vns_ep ] ) , ( [ eq : decay_tangle2 ] ) , ( [ eq : reform ] ) , and ( [ eq : growth_tangle2 ] ) , and the conclusions that follow from them , are unaltered by stratification ; even though the volume of the outer core occupied by the vortex tangle ( which does not affect the torque on the crust directly ) does change .",
    "the ekman layer thickness decreases as @xmath242 , where @xmath243 is the thickness without stratification and @xmath244 is the compressibility of the fluid .",
    "the ekman time - scale increases as @xmath245 , where @xmath246 is the time - scale without stratification .",
    "the fluid is restricted to move on concentric spherical shells @xcite .",
    "importantly , @xmath245 is the time for the ekman layer to extend throughout the outer core , not the time required to establish the meridional flow at @xmath247 ( @xmath248 ) , which controls the onset of the dgi .",
    "it is conceivable that the dgi is excited in shells at certain radii where @xmath136 peaks , so that we end up with a sequence of shells containing alternating laminar and turbulent superfluid vorticity . in this scenario ,",
    "the detailed study of which lies outside the scope of this paper , the stability of the vorticity configuration is restricted by the richardson criterion , which states that the configuration is kelvin - helmholtz unstable for @xmath249 @xcite . in a neutron star ,",
    "the brunt - visla frequency is @xmath250 @xcite .",
    "the effects of stratification are not considered in detail in this paper because they can not be studied properly with our numerical method ; the pressure projection step only works with divergence - free velocity fields @xcite .",
    "however , a crude approach to get a feel for the effects is to numerically suppress @xmath251 using a low - pass exponential filter @xcite , viz . @xmath252",
    "v_r $ ] , with @xmath253 , where @xmath254 is the machine zero , and @xmath255 is the order of the filter . if we ramp up @xmath255 with @xmath172 as @xmath256 , with @xmath257 and @xmath258 , then @xmath251 is weakly suppressed near @xmath48 ( @xmath259 ) and strongly suppressed near @xmath47 ( @xmath260 ) , so that the flow is confined approximately to concentric shells .",
    "preliminary results , for a viscous navier - stokes fluid , show that the filtering reduces the meridional circulation , flattening the streamlines radially .",
    "in this paper , we investigate how transitions between turbulent and laminar states of superfluid vorticity alter the standard theoretical picture of pulsar rotational irregularities like glitches and timing noise .",
    "( i ) most of the time , except in the immediate aftermath of a glitch , differential rotation in the outer core drives a nonzero , poloidal counterflow which continuously excites the dgi .",
    "a vortex tangle is thereby maintained in the outer core .",
    "the mutual friction in this regime , which is of gm form , couples the normal and superfluid components loosely .",
    "( ii ) immediately after a glitch , the differential rotation ceases , as does the poloidal counterflow .",
    "the vortex tangle decays over the mean life - time of its constituent vortex rings , @xmath261 s. a rectilinear vortex array develops , and the mutual friction switches to hv form , coupling the normal and superfluid components much more strongly .",
    "( iii ) after @xmath262 yr , electromagnetic spin down builds up the differential rotation sufficiently to drive a poloidal counterflow that exceeds the dgi threshold .",
    "a vortex tangle forms again in a time @xmath263 s , and the mutual friction reverts to gm form . note that vortex pinning provides the boundary conditions for the superfluid scf but does not occur within the outer core itself @xcite .",
    "_ therefore our new phenomenological picture is not a complete model for glitches_. it merely clarifies the vorticity state of the outer core before and after a glitch as an input into future models than incorporate the full glitch dynamics , including trigger mechanisms related to pinning in the inner crust .",
    "we draw together the strands of the model in figure [ fig : fig9 ] , which displays the evolution of the torque and the regions where the dgi is active during the following numerical experiment : we fix @xmath76 until @xmath196 , accelerate the outer sphere instantaneously to corotation at @xmath196 , then decelerate the outer sphere according to @xmath264 for @xmath265 .",
    "this mimics the situation in a real pulsar , where we have @xmath266 , i.e. ekman pumping brings the fluid into corotation _ before _",
    "the dgi gradually starts being reexcited throughout the outer core . to make the experiment as realistic as possible",
    ", we do not assume that the mutual friction takes the same form everywhere in the outer core , but rather choose gm or hv friction at each point according to whether @xmath267 is greater or less than @xmath166 locally .",
    "in this comparison , we approximate @xmath268 by @xmath269 , as in equation ( [ eq : vns_ep ] ) , because @xmath270 can become very complicated ( e.g. figure [ fig : fig1 ] ) , creating numerical difficulties . in order to satisfy @xmath266 while keeping @xmath199 large enough so that the spheres  lap \" each other several times , we are forced by computational exigencies to adopt a relatively low reynolds number @xmath271 , shortening the ekman time ( @xmath272 ) , and to artificially boost @xmath166 , so that @xmath273 does not exceed @xmath274 throughout the computational domain .",
    "the results of the above numerical experiment are presented in figure [ fig : fig9 ] .",
    "contours of @xmath273 , before and after the spin up at @xmath196 , are plotted in figures [ fig : fig9]a[fig : fig9]e .",
    "shaded regions indicate where the dgi is active , i.e. @xmath275 . just before the glitch ( figure [ fig : fig9]a ) , @xmath276 % of the superfluid is in a turbulent state , with the dgi active close to the inner sphere and at intermediate latitudes where meridional circulation is significant .",
    "after the differential rotation shuts off at @xmath196 , the dgi initially spreads through the shell as transient axial flows increase , occupying @xmath277 % of the volume at @xmath240 .",
    "however , the flow quickly settles down to a state of near - corotation during the time interval @xmath278 , hv friction dominates , and the torque decays exponentially , with time constant @xmath184 ( followed by a linear decay ) . at @xmath279 , the dgi slowly begins to assert itself again , starting from the inner sphere . as for a classical viscous fluid , when the outer sphere spins down , it pumps fluid radially inward and along the axis of rotation @xcite , so the axial flow speed is greatest near the inner sphere . by @xmath280 , when @xmath76 , the vorticity state is similar to that at @xmath196 , before spin up .",
    "one might wonder if , in a realistic neutron star , the superfluid ever exits the turbulent state and becomes laminar .",
    "for the simulations in this paper , which have @xmath281 , the answer is yes .",
    "figure [ fig : fig9 ] shows that , when the glitch occurs and the spheres come into corotation , @xmath282 falls below the dgi threshold after a time @xmath283 .",
    "the vortex tangle is then guaranteed to decay on a time - scale given by ( [ eq : decay_tangle1 ] ) and ( [ eq : decay_tangle2 ] ) , as observed in terrestrial experiments . however , for more realistic neutron star reynolds numbers ( @xmath284 ) , which are too challenging to simulate at present , the turbulent eddies in the normal fluid decay more slowly when the spheres come into corotation , so that @xmath282 remains above the dgi threshold for longer . if this happens , the vortex tangle may persist until the next glitch occurs , so that the superfluid never exits the turbulent state .    what are the implications of figure [ fig : fig9 ] and the results in  [ sec : vtmodel ] and  [ sec : rotevol ] for observations of glitches ?",
    "before considering this question , we emphasize again that the results in this paper do not constitute a theory of glitches , because important questions regarding the glitch trigger remain unresolved . nevertheless , some general remarks can be made .",
    "first of all , it is clear that transitions between flow ( and vorticity ) states in superfluid scf are caused by changes in @xmath64 , and that such transitions become more frequent and complicated as @xmath64 increases @xcite .",
    "this is compatible with the observation that adolescent pulsars ( @xmath183 yr old , like vela ) glitch most actively @xcite . in younger pulsars ( age @xmath285 yr ) , @xmath101 and",
    "hence @xmath13 are relatively high , so @xmath64 is low . in older pulsars ( age @xmath286 yr ) , @xmath287 and",
    "hence @xmath64 are low following electromagnetic spin down [ although this trend is not straightforward and can be masked by localized heating from differential rotation between the superfluid and the crust @xcite or crust cracking @xcite ] .",
    "a systematic statistical study of glitch activity versus @xmath64 will be published elsewhere @xcite , but preliminary estimates of @xmath101 and hence @xmath64 from cooling curves @xcite including superfluidity @xcite give reynolds numbers in the range @xmath288 for glitching pulsars .",
    "two of the most active glitchers , the crab and vela , have @xmath289 and @xmath290 respectively .",
    "one expects that , at such high @xmath64 , the fluid is turbulent , with the kinetic energy concentrated at large scales @xcite , as for a classical viscous fluid @xcite .",
    "this suggests that superfluid turbulence in pulsar interiors is an important factor in glitch dynamics .",
    "if it is true that the vorticity in the outer core exists in a turbulent state before a glitch , as postulated in our model , then @xmath163 represents a lower bound on the time between glitches . in testing whether this bound is respected by the glitching pulsars currently known",
    ", we are hampered by the fact that most of these objects have only glitched once .",
    "nevertheless , for all the @xmath291 pulsars that have glitched repeteadly , we find that the minimum inter - glitch time interval @xmath292 is greater than @xmath163 , as the theory predicts @xcite .",
    "the object psr @xmath293 approaches the bound most closely , with @xmath294 yr and @xmath295 yr .",
    "this is encouraging , because the @xmath291 objects cover five decades in @xmath163 and three decades in @xmath292 , and the theoretical expression ( [ eq : reform ] ) for @xmath163 contains zero free parameters .",
    "note that @xmath163 is proportional to the characteristic age ( @xmath296 ) divided by @xmath297 .",
    "note also that the activity parameter defined by @xcite involves glitch amplitudes ( which are highly variable ) as well as mean recurrence times , so we do not predict a correlation between the activity parameter and @xmath163 .",
    "it is harder to test the theoretical decay time - scale of the vortex tangle , as predicted by ( [ eq : decay_tangle2 ] ) , because it remains unclear what observable features are engendered by the decay process .",
    "the observed exponential post - glitch relaxation is of viscous origin and occurs on a time - scale much larger than @xmath116 . on the other hand ,",
    "the decay of the tangle is accompanied by a large increase in mutual friction ( gm @xmath176 hv ) , which may be connected with the rapid jump in @xmath287 during a glitch .",
    "the jump in @xmath287 has never been resolved in time , in pulsars which are nearly constantly monitored , consistent with the predictions of ( [ eq : decay_tangle2 ] ) for the crab ( @xmath298 s ) and vela ( @xmath299 s ) .",
    "however , equation ( [ eq : decay_tangle2 ] ) predicts that it may be possible to resolve the @xmath287 jump in older pulsars , provided that the time between glitches does not increase faster than @xmath85 . in making these estimates",
    "we assume the canonical value @xmath300 for every object , in the absence of a microscopic theory , yet this is clearly an oversimplification because @xmath137 is sensitively temperature dependent .",
    "oscillations in @xmath85 were observed before ( period @xmath184 d ) and after ( period @xmath301 d ) the vela christmas glitch , with @xmath302 @xcite . in our numerical simulations , persistent torque oscillations are always observed when the outer core rotates differentially , as occurs before a glitch .",
    "they are also observed after a switch from gm to hv friction , as occurs after a glitch . by comparing the dashed and solid curves in figure [ fig : fig8]b",
    ", we see that the oscillations are sustained by hv mutual friction .",
    "the oscillation period in our simulations is much shorter than in pulsar data , because we are restricted to @xmath303 .",
    "an alternative explanation is that vortices in the inner crust oscillate relative to the normal fluid in the core @xcite .",
    "several of the effects explored in this paper have been studied in terrestrial laboratories .",
    "our results will motivate new experiments of this sort , cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "although it is hard to access the neutron star regime @xmath304 in he ii , where interatomic forces are appreciable , transitions between turbulent and laminar superfluid vorticiy have been observed in experiments with microspheres immersed in @xmath10he at mk temperatures @xcite .",
    "promising results on the relaxation of rotating he ii were obtained by @xcite , but again these results are for @xmath305 and hollow spheres rather than a differentially rotating shell .",
    "we propose to extend these experiments in two directions : ( i ) by investigating low - rossby - number ( @xmath306 ) , high - reynolds - number ( @xmath307 ) scf with he ii at the temperature which minimizes @xmath308 ; and ( ii ) by repeating ( i ) with a nonideal dilute - gas bose - einstein condensate confined in a differentially rotating magneto - optical trap , in order to probe the stability of a vortex lattice to kelvin wave excitations in the regime @xmath304 @xcite .",
    "the presence of a vortex tangle in he ii can be detected by standard second - sound absorption techniques @xcite , and the torque in experiment ( i ) can be monitored to look for oscillations when a change from hv to gm friction ( or vice versa ) is triggered by the dgi .    in classical navier - stokes fluids ,",
    "injection of vorticity into a metastable laminar state can trigger turbulence , e.g. seed vortices injected into a cylindrical vessel containing @xmath9he - b ( with @xmath309 ) generate a vortex tangle that eventually decays into a rectilinear vortex array @xcite .",
    "unlike he ii , the normal component in @xmath9he - b is laminar in these experiments and does not participate in the turbulent dynamics , due to its comparatively high viscosity [ @xmath310 @xmath311 s@xmath111 @xmath312 , cf .",
    "@xmath313 in he ii ; see @xcite ] .",
    "standard glitch theories assume that the normal component is tightly coupled to the crust by the external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this suggest a second possible scf experiment with @xmath9he - b ( at @xmath309 ) in a hollow spherical container in which the normal fluid corotates with the container , and therefore does not participate in the dgi , while the superfluid is free to become turbulent .",
    "such an experiment can probe what aspects of the turbulent - laminar transition are caused by the normal and superfluid components respectively .",
