    "uncovering the drivers of fluctuations in animal abundance is a fundamental goal of population biology .",
    "it is especially important in fisheries science where unexpected population failures may lead to large economic losses @xcite .",
    "a major source of variability in most fish populations is in the recruitment stage , however , attempts to predict recruitment have met limited success .",
    "one explanation for this failure of prediction is that strong process error and measurement error effectively obscures any predictable signal . as a result",
    ", one might conclude that year - to - year fluctuations in recruitment are best viewed as functionally random .",
    "the idea that recruitment is driven by stochastic events is not new .",
    "the role of the environment on larval survival was studied extensively in the early 20th century @xcite .",
    "larval vulnerability was linked to growth which in turn was linked to stochastic environmental conditions @xcite .",
    "the general conclusion of which was that small variations in survival due to environmental conditions can lead to large variations in future abundance .",
    "this , combined with demographic stochasticity which may be an important source of year - to - year variability in depleted populations @xcite , may explain the commonly - observed high variation in recruitment time series .",
    "a counter to the random view was established in now - classic work by may and colleagues which showed that complex , apparently random , dynamics can arise in simple nonlinear systems @xcite .",
    "therefore , an alternative explanation for recruitment variability is that it arises from intrinsic population dynamics coupled with environmental forcing .",
    "this should result in recruitment time series that contain a detectable non - random signal , albeit one that is convolved with stochasticity and observation error .",
    "many attempts have been made to extract meaningful patterns from recruitment data .",
    "a common approach is to identify a covariate which might explain some of the variability in average recruitment .",
    "the spawner - recruit relationship is a well - known example of this that has met various levels of success @xcite .",
    "changes in predation have also been identified as important ( @xcite ) , as well as more recent studies which have highlighted the importance of environmental regimes @xcite .",
    "these studies provide firm evidence that recruitment is , in general , not random .",
    "however , they do not address our question of whether a non - random signal can be detected in the _ year - to - year _ variations in _",
    "univariate _ time series of recruitment .",
    "this distinction is important , because even though a deterministic relationship may exist between recruitment and some covariate , this does not automatically mean that a non - random signal will be found in the resulting time series , especially when strong stochasticity and observation error are present .",
    "here we address this fundamental question by determining whether an underlying non - random signal can be detected in the annual fluctuations of recruit abundance in 569 time series of the ransom a. myers global stock - recruitment database ( ram , @xcite ) .",
    "to do so , we use a monte carlo , nonparametric time series method which , unlike past studies based on parametric models , side - steps the problem of model - misspecification . we measure the strength of the non - random signal using a randomization test which estimates the probability that a population s recruitment time series originates from a random process ( @xmath0 , fig .  1 ) .",
    "many of the time series in the ram database are short and noisy , therefore a signal of non - randomness is noteworthy , if it exists .",
    "a recruit is defined as an individual that has recently reached a particular life - stage @xcite . in fisheries science , recruits are typically those that recently reached the minimum size to be legally harvested .",
    "the ram database is a global database of time series records of recruit abundance encompassing over 600 fish populations and over 100 species from marine and freshwater environments ( @xcite , fig .",
    "time series lengths in the ram database vary from as little as five years to as many as 74 years , with a mean length of 20.7 years .",
    "all populations with at least 10 years of data were included in the analysis , resulting in 569 populations .",
    "leave - one - out cross - validation was performed using simplex projection @xcite , a nonparametric time series analysis method with one free parameter ( embedding dimension , _ e _ ) .",
    "like all time series methods , it operates under the assumption that if the data - generating process is non - random , then the present state of the population should provide some information about the future state . following takens theorem @xcite , simplex predictions are made by finding similar past states and projecting them forward .",
    "lags of the original time series are used to form a reconstruction of the high - dimensional `` attractor '' , which is then used to make predictions ( fig .",
    "the dimensionality of the reconstruction is determined by the embedding dimension ( _ e _ ) which we restrict to values of one to four ( fig .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it is robust to model misspecification @xcite , the validity of the approach is determined using a monte carlo test .",
    "since the method used here is univariate , we are able to test the dynamics of fish populations that lack spawner abundance data as only recruit data is required . this expands the number of fish populations that we can investigate compared to previous studies that required both spawner and recruit data .",
    "if recruit abundance is dominated by random forcing , present abundance will fail to predict future abundance . in this regard",
    ", we use a monte carlo test to determine whether the cross - validation fit for the real time series is significantly better than would be obtained from a random time series with the same statistical properties ( i.e. , the same empirical probability distribution and autoregressive properties ) . for each population",
    ", we fit an autoregressive model of order zero or one ( chosen using aicc ) , which is then used to generate 1000 random time series ( similar to the method of `` surrogate data , '' @xcite ) .",
    "the probability that the real time series is random ( @xmath0 ) is obtained by comparing the simplex fit for the real time series ( @xmath1 , fig .",
    "1a ) to the distribution of simplex fits for 1000 random time series ( @xmath2 , fig .",
    "cross - validation fit was measured as the correlation between predicted and observed recruit abundances .",
    "we allow for non - normal random time series by using an empirical density function when the best - fit autoregressive model is of order zero .",
    "if the recruitment time series are non - random , we expect to gain confidence in this with additional time series observations ( previously described as `` convergence '' @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , if the system is functionally stochastic , our confidence should decrease with additional observations .",
    "if convergence is occurring it will be represented by a decrease in probability random ( @xmath0 ) with increasing time series length .",
    "we test for convergence by performing a beta - regression of time - series length on @xmath0 .",
    "that is , we evaluate the relationship between the number of recruitment observations in a time series and the @xmath0 for that time series .",
    "if @xmath0 decreases as time series length increases we conclude this is evidence of convergence .",
    "importantly , probability random ( @xmath0 ) is not expected to decrease merely due to an increase in time series length . to illustrate this point",
    ", we perform the monte carlo procedure on three example random datasets ( fig .",
    "2a - c , e - g ) . for all datasets , the real time series",
    "are replaced with purely random time series of the same length and gaps ( missing values ) as the real time series .",
    "three random datasets were simulated : 1 ) a standard - normal random variable ( white noise ) , 2 ) an autocorrelated random variable with mean and return rate of the real time series ( autocorrelated noise ) , and 3 ) a standard log - normal random variable ( log - normal noise ) .",
    "all of the example random datasets fail to exhibit convergence .",
    "importantly , none of the example random datasets showed evidence of convergence toward non - random dynamics , as the histograms of @xmath3 are not skewed towards low values ( fig .  2 a - c ) , nor is there convergence toward low @xmath3 with increasing time series length ( fig",
    ".  2 e - g ) .",
    "in contrast to the example random datasets , the ram database exhibited strong evidence for non - randomness .",
    "the most commonly observed value of @xmath3 for the ram database was less than 0.03 ( i.e. , the mode of the distribution , fig .",
    "furthermore , the overall distribution of @xmath0 is significantly skewed towards low values ( @xmath4 , kolmogorov - smirnov test ) .",
    "in contrast , the three simulated random datasets had distributions of @xmath0 that were not significantly different from a uniform distribution ( @xmath5 , fig .  2 a , b , c ) .",
    "if recruitment time series have a detectable non - random signal , @xmath0 should diminish with additional observations ( i.e. , convergence should occur ) .",
    "this is observed in the ram database .",
    "populations with long time series have a lower @xmath3 on average than those with short time series ( fig .",
    "this trend was strongly significant ( beta regression , @xmath4 ) . moreover , not only does @xmath0 decline , but the amount of variance explained by the nonparametric model increases with increasing time series length ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "this suggests that with increasing observations the underlying dynamics become increasingly clear .    despite the wide variety of methods used to estimate abundance in the ram database , we observe convergence towards non - random dynamics in all major abundance estimation methods ( those with @xmath630 populations , fig .  4 , fig .",
    "this was also observed in all but one major family ( fig .  5 , fig .",
    "percidae is the only major family that fails to exhibit convergence ( fig .",
    "5c ) , and is also the only major family that does not contain at least one long time series ( @xmath635 years ) .",
    "the rate of convergence ( i.e. , the slope of the beta - regression line ) is proportional to the length of the longest time series ( fig .",
    "thus , families with long time series are more likely to exhibit non - random dynamics , and we expect percidae to exhibit non - random dynamics with additional observations .",
    "we also find that populations with significant high - order partial autocorrelation are more likely to be classified as non - random ( fig .",
    "s8 ) , which again suggests that a non - random pattern exists in those time series .    in summary , using data only on recruit abundance , we uncover a widespread pattern of non - random dynamics in fish recruitment . this result is robust across all major abundance estimation methods and fish families .",
    "this builds upon previous studies which have identified covariates related to average levels of recruitment , as well as time series studies on smaller datasets ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to the recruitment database , we find all of the simulated random datasets and the environmental time series fail to show evidence of non - random dynamics .",
    "our results suggest that with time we should be able to uncover the drivers of inter - annual recruitment fluctuations , however it is difficult to draw broad conclusions about mechanisms from this study alone .",
    "one possibility is that the patterns of recruitment in the ram database are driven by persistent shifts in regimes which are driven by environmental forcing , or changes in predator and prey abundance @xcite .",
    "multiple factors unique to each species are likely involved , and focused studies are required to uncover mechanisms . in this",
    "regard , mechanistic studies could be complimented by nonparametric methods to ensure robust conclusions .",
    "fish recruitment is a complex process operating on a range of temporal and spatial scales , therefore it is unsurprising that it is difficult to anticipate recruitment fluctuations .",
    "however here , using a simple time series approach , we have shown that non - random dynamics are widespread in recruitment .",
    "this suggests that prediction of fish recruitment should eventually be possible , as is already true in some cases ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "the increasing probability of observing non - random dynamics with additional observations suggests that predictability will also increase with continued observations . with time series data for key parallel variables it should be possible to identify the mechanisms that drive recruitment fluctuations",
    "this provides the encouraging news that further work will allow improved forecasting and management of our wild fisheries .",
