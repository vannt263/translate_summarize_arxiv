    "magnetic - field - induced transition of magnetism is an outstanding phenomenon in the strongly - correlated electron systems and is associated with many physical interests , such as the unconventional superconductivity,@xcite the non - fermi - liquid behaviors,@xcite and the multiferroicity,@xcite etc .",
    "it is known that multiferroicity is a result of strong coupling between magnetic and electric degrees of freedom in insulators and has received a lot of research interests because of its application usage . in this family of materials , for example the rare - earth manganites rmno@xmath0 ( r = rare - earth elements),@xcite it is commonly found that the magnetic - field - induced transitions of magnetic structures are accompanied by the drastic changes of dielectric properties . understanding the microscopic magnetic ordering across these transition boundaries is therefore very helpful for revealing the mechanism of magnetoelectric coupling , a topic of much current interest .",
    "we select the hexagonal manganite homno@xmath0 as a representative object for studying the magnetic - field - induced transitions and their impacts on physical properties .",
    "this compound is ferroelectric below @xmath8 = 875 k and the moments of mn@xmath7 and ho@xmath7 ions display antiferromagnetic ( af ) orderings at @xmath9 = 75 k and @xmath10 = 4.6 k , respectively .",
    "the peculiarity of homno@xmath0 is that it shows several transitions of the magnetic structure upon lowering temperature or increasing magnetic field , which results in a very rich @xmath6-@xmath1 phase diagram at low temperatures.@xcite furthermore , these low-@xmath1 field - induced transitions are confirmed to cause drastic changes of dielectric constant.@xcite however , the low-@xmath1 magnetic structures and the mechanisms of field - induced transitions are still not fully understood , in spite of a lot of experimental investigations using neutron scattering , optical and microwave techniques , etc.@xcite this is due to the complexity of mn@xmath7 and ho@xmath7 magnetism in this compound .",
    "the mn@xmath7 ions form triangular planar sublattices and the af exchange coupling among mn@xmath7 moments is geometrically frustrated . as a result , below @xmath9 ,",
    "the mn@xmath7 moments are ordered in a configuration that the neighboring moments are 120@xmath11 rotated . however , the homometric configurations of the mn@xmath7 moments in the triangular lattice are difficult to distinguish from each other.@xcite it was assumed that the ho@xmath7 moments are orientated along the @xmath5 axis with an ising - like anisotropy , and their spin structures are not simple because the ho@xmath7 ions present in two different crystallographic sites",
    ". the formed two ho@xmath7 sublattices can order separately in either parallel or anti - parallel orientations.@xcite for these complexities , even the zero - field spin structures at low temperatures have not been completely clarified , let alone those in the field - induced phases .",
    "heat transport behavior has recently received a lot of interests in studying strongly - correlated electron systems and low - dimensional spin systems.@xcite it has been found that the low-@xmath1 heat transport can probe not only the transport properties of many kinds of elementary excitations , such as phonons , magnons , spinons and quasiparitcles in superconductors , but also the coupling between crystal lattice and spins.@xcite in addition , the heat transport behavior in magnetic field is an effective way to study the magnetic - field - induced quantum phase transitions,@xcite for example , the field - induced af ordering ( which can be described as the magnon bose - einstein condensation ) in spin - gapped quantum magnets.@xcite in this paper , we show that the low-@xmath1 heat transport of homno@xmath0 single crystals is very useful for probing the magnetic structures and the field - induced phase transitions .",
    "it is found that the spin - phonon coupling is extremely strong in this material and results in very strong field dependence of thermal conductivity ( @xmath2 ) . in particular ,",
    "the thermal conductivity is significantly suppressed at several critical fields , which are related to the transitions of magnetic structure .",
    "the present data provide new suggestions on the magnetic structures of the low-@xmath1 phases .",
    "high - quality homno@xmath0 single crystals are grown by using a floating - zone technique .",
    "the crystals are carefully checked by using the x - ray laue photograph and cut precisely along the crystallographic axes , with parallelepiped shape and typical size of @xmath12 .",
    "the thermal conductivities are measured along both the @xmath4 plane ( @xmath13 ) and the @xmath5 axis ( @xmath14 ) by using a conventional steady - state technique and two different processes : ( i ) using a  one heater , two thermometers \" technique in a @xmath15he refrigerator and a 14 t magnet at temperature regime of 0.38 k ; ( ii ) using a chromel - constantan thermocouple in a @xmath16he cryostat for zero - field data above 4 k.@xcite",
    "-plane and the @xmath5-axis thermal conductivities of homno@xmath0 single crystals .",
    "the heat transport data of ymno@xmath0 single crystals grown by the floating - zone method are also shown for comparison.,width=245 ]    figure 1 shows the temperature dependences of @xmath13 and @xmath17 of homno@xmath0 single crystals in zero field , together with those of ymno@xmath0 for comparison .",
    "these data essentially reproduce the results of a former report.@xcite the heat transport behavior of ymno@xmath0 is a typical one in insulating crystals,@xcite except for a ",
    "dip \"- like feature at @xmath18 70 k. the large phonon peaks at 15 k indicate a high quality of the crystals .",
    "the  dip \" at 70 k is clearly related to the af ordering of mn@xmath7 moments , where the spin fluctuations scatter phonons strongly .",
    "similar feature at 70 k also appears in homno@xmath0 .",
    "however , the heat transport of homno@xmath0 is very different from that of ymno@xmath0 in two aspects .",
    "first , the low-@xmath1 phonon conductivity is much weaker in homno@xmath0 , with the phonon peak completely being wiped out , suggesting very strong phonon scattering.@xcite this is in good agreement with the evidences of spin - phonon coupling from other measurements.@xcite second , another ",
    "dip \"- like feature shows up at @xmath18 4 k , which corresponds to the af ordering temperature of ho@xmath7 moments .",
    "it is important to notice that although ho@xmath7 moments are ordered below 4.6 k,@xcite the strong phonon scattering seems to appear at temperature as high as 70 k. such broad temperature regime for spin - phonon scattering is not likely to be caused only by the ho@xmath7 moments .",
    "it is already known that the mn@xmath7 sublattice has several spin re - orientation transitions upon lowering temperature.@xcite obviously , these successive transitions strengthen the spin fluctuations in mn@xmath7 sublattice and contribute to the phonon scattering .",
    "in contrast , the re - orientations of mn@xmath7 spin lattice do not occur in ymno@xmath0 .",
    "single crystals in both the zero field and several different magnetic fields up to 14 t. the heat current are applied along the @xmath4 plane or the @xmath5 axis , while the magnetic field applied either in the @xmath4 plane ( along the @xmath19-axis or [ 210 ] directions ) or along the @xmath5 axis.,width=321 ]    the strong spin - phonon coupling suggests that the magnetic - field dependence of heat transport would be very useful for studying the low-@xmath1 magnetic structures and their transitions .",
    "figure 2 shows the temperature dependences of thermal conductivity in different magnetic fields up to 14 t , which clearly show an extremely large magnetothermal effect . by passing ,",
    "it is worthy of pointing out that the magnetic field produces so strong torque , especially for @xmath20 , that the samples can be completely destroyed .",
    "this makes the measurement very difficult and it is almost impossible to get high - field data in some field directions .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "2 that a low magnetic field strongly suppresses the phonon heat transport and makes the zero - field dip of @xmath21 at @xmath10 to be shallower and broader and to shift to lower temperatures . in high magnetic field ,",
    "the heat transport is significantly enhanced , particularly at temperature regime of 26 k , in which the spin - phonon scattering seems to be the strongest in zero field .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that the high magnetic field weakens the phonon scattering by spin fluctuations .",
    "however , one should note that although the field dependence becomes rather weak in high fields and below 1 k , the temperature dependence of @xmath2 in high fields is still much weaker than the @xmath22 law , suggesting the remaining of some microscopic scattering on phonons .",
    "single crystals at low temperatures.,width=321 ]    the detailed magnetic - field dependences of thermal conductivity @xmath3 are shown in fig .",
    "3 . the extremely strong coupling between phonons and magnetic excitations leads to so strong field dependence of @xmath2 that the magnitude of thermal conductivity can be suppressed down to @xmath18 10% at some particular low fields and be enhanced up to 20 times at 14 t. to our knowledge , such a large magnetothermal effect has not been observed in other materials including some rare - earth manganites.@xcite at 4.1 k , where the zero - field @xmath21 data indicate the strongest spin - phonon scattering , the external magnetic field suppresses the magnetic excitations and reduces the phonon scattering .",
    "it is therefore easy to understand that both @xmath13 and @xmath14 show significant enhancement with increasing field .",
    "apparently , the thermal conductivity can be even larger before it gets saturated in very high magnetic field above 14 t ( @xmath23 ) and becomes at least comparable to that of ymno@xmath0 , which is free from the spin - phonon scattering .",
    "it is notable that the @xmath3 isotherms below 4 k are quite different from the higher-@xmath1 results .",
    "an interesting phenomenon is that there is one  dip \" in @xmath3 curves for magnetic field in the @xmath4 plane , while there are two  dips \" in @xmath3 for the magnetic field along the @xmath5 axis .",
    "the characteristic of these  dips \" is that the fields for the minimum @xmath2 are nearly independent of the temperature , which indicates an origin from the spin - flop transitions or spin re - orientations.@xcite in an af ordered state , the zeeman energy causes the magnon excitations to become gapless at the spin - flop field , but the gap opens again at higher field;@xcite consequently , the magnon scattering of phonons is the strongest at the spin - flop field , where the magnons are the most populated , and causes a `` dip''-like feature in the @xmath3 curve .",
    "as we know , the low-@xmath1 field - induced transitions for @xmath24 have been intensively studied by the dielectric - constant , microwave and neutron measurements.@xcite the  dip \" fields of @xmath3 at @xmath18 1 and 2 t are in rather good correspondence with the two successive transitions among the zero - field phase and some field - induced phases ( named as  lt1 \" and  lt2 \" phases in refs . [ ] ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that the low-@xmath1 magnetic structure has actually not been completely understood . between the two possibilities of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 space groups being the proposed zero - field mn@xmath7 magnetic structure,@xcite more experiments supported the former one .",
    "based on this , it was discussed that the magnetic - field - induced  lt1 \" and  lt2 \" phases are likely to have the magnetic structures of @xmath26 and @xmath25 , respectively.@xcite however , it has not yet been clarified how these two magnetic transitions are driven .",
    "note that the @xmath5-axis field can hardly affect the magnetic structure of mn@xmath7 moments directly , because they are strongly confined in the @xmath4 plane .",
    "it is the significant coupling between mn@xmath7 and ho@xmath7 moments that may lead to the change of mn@xmath7 sublattice when the ho@xmath7 moments change their directions or are polarized.@xcite this possibility was firstly confirmed in a previous work , in which the polarization of ho@xmath7 moments formed by an external electric field causes a 90@xmath27 rotation of mn@xmath7 sublattice.@xcite it is known that the ho@xmath7 ions locate on two different positions of  2@xmath19 \" and  4@xmath28 \" ( see fig .",
    "4 ) in the crystal lattice , but the magnetism of ho@xmath7 ions is not very clear.@xcite some experiments suggested that the ho@xmath7 moments on 4@xmath28 sites are antiferromagnetically ordered at low temperatures and those on 2@xmath19 sites are disordered.@xcite apparently , the magnetic field along the @xmath5 axis can induce only one sharp polarization transition of the 4@xmath28 sublattice in this case . therefore , the two  dip \"- like transitions observed in @xmath3 curves undoubtedly demonstrate that the zero - field ho@xmath7 magnetic structure must be different from that suggested configuration.@xcite the present data point to a natural possibility as shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) , in which the ho@xmath7 moments on 2@xmath19 and 4@xmath28 sublattices are all antiferromagnetically ordered with opposite spin directions between two sublattices .",
    "this magnetic structure was previously proposed for an intermediate - temperature phase.@xcite correspondingly , the two - step sharp transitions of ho@xmath7 sublattice can cause the mn@xmath7 sublattice to perform 90@xmath27 rotations twice , with the space group changing from @xmath25 to @xmath26 and then probably back to @xmath25 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , which is consistent with the suggestion in some earlier work.@xcite     at low temperatures and those in applied magnetic field .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the zero - field ( @xmath25 ) and high - field ( @xmath26 ) magnetic structures of mn@xmath7 moments for @xmath29 .",
    "panels ( b  d ) show the proposed two transitions of magnetic structure when the magnetic field ( @xmath20 ) is increasing .",
    "the two sublattices of af ho@xmath7 moments are polarized separately at two critical fields .",
    "correspondingly , the mn@xmath7 moments make 90@xmath27 rotations twice.,width=321 ]    since the low-@xmath1 phase diagram for @xmath29 has not been explored,@xcite the above direct comparison of heat transport results with others is not available . in this regard ,",
    "the present heat transport data provide unprecedented information on the low-@xmath1 phase diagram and phase transitions for @xmath30 .",
    "it is clear that the thermal conductivity data demonstrate a single spin - flop transition for @xmath29 , which can only occur in the mn@xmath7 sublattice considering the ising - like anisotropy of ho@xmath7 moments .",
    "note that in figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(c ) , we show the data for magnetic field along two different in - plane directions , that is , [ 100 ] ( along the @xmath19 axis ) and [ 210 ] , as indicated in fig .",
    "it can be seen that there is a clear anisotropy of the transition field between these two directions .",
    "similar phenomenon was observed in some other materials , for example , the parent compounds of electron - doped high-@xmath8 cuprate r@xmath31cuo@xmath32 ( r = nd , pr),@xcite in which the critical fields for their non - collinear cu@xmath33 spin structure changing to a collinear one are dependent on the direction of magnetic field .",
    "it is not very difficult to obtain the theoretical explanation on such anisotropy of the spin - flop transition in the square spin lattice.@xcite however , as far as the triangular spin lattice is concerned , it is still a remained question about how the spins rotate upon increasing field and how such rotation depends on the direction of the magnetic field.@xcite similar to the spin re - orientations for @xmath20 , it is likely that the in - plane field may drive the zero - field magnetic structure of @xmath25 symmetry undergoing a 90@xmath27 rotation and changing to the @xmath26 one at the critical field . by now , however , it is not possible to make a straightforward judgment on which direction is easier for the external field to drive the spin re - orientation of the @xmath25 spin structure .",
    "nevertheless , the thermal conductivity data indeed detect such anisotropy of transition field in an explicit way .",
    "finally , the proposed magnetic structures and their transitions are summarized in fig .",
    "the low-@xmath1 heat transport of homno@xmath0 single crystals is found to be strongly dependent on the magnetic field , demonstrating an exceptionally strong spin - phonon coupling .",
    "furthermore , the  dip \"- like transitions in low-@xmath1 @xmath3 isotherms are found to be useful for clarifying the magnetic structures of the field - induced phases .",
    "the @xmath3 data for @xmath20 suggest that ho@xmath7 moments form two af sublattices and undergo two - step polarizations upon increasing field .",
    "correspondingly , the mn@xmath7 sublattice undergoes two spin re - orientations because of the strong interaction between ho@xmath7 and mn@xmath7 moments .",
    "the @xmath3 data for @xmath29 indicate a new finding of spin - flop transition of mn@xmath7 sublattice , whose transition field shows an in - plane anisotropy .",
