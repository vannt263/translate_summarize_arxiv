    "the study of knot spaces consists mainly of the study of spaces of non singular knots ( compare @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we change the point of view : we construct a 1-cocycle for some space which includes singular knots too .",
    "this 1-cocycle is identical zero on all loops which consist only of non - singular knots .",
    "the space of all ( possibly singular long ) knots was introduced and studied by vassiliev in the pioniering work @xcite .",
    "it is the space of all differentable maps @xmath6 which agree with @xmath7 outside of @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "this is a contractible space ( compare @xcite ) , let us call it @xmath9 .",
    "we identify then as usual a knot with its image @xmath10 .",
    "a knot is _ non - singular _ if @xmath10 is a smooth submanifold , otherwise it is called _",
    "singular_. knots are oriented from the left to the right .",
    "the singular knots form the discriminant @xmath11 of the space of all ( long ) knots .",
    "it has a natural stratification .",
    "the complement of the discriminant are the _",
    "chambers_. they correspond to the ( non - singular ) knot types .",
    "vassiliev has introduced a filtration on the cohomology of the chambers .",
    "the 0-dimensional part are the well - known vassiliev knot invariants ( for all this compare @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    instead of vassiliev s knot space @xmath9 we will study the space @xmath0 of long framed knots .",
    "we fixe a plane in 3-space which contains the @xmath12 and we fixe an orthogonal projection @xmath13 of the 3-space into this plane .",
    "@xmath0 is the space of all those ( possibly singular ) knots for which the restriction of @xmath13 on the knots is an immersion .",
    "the chambers of @xmath0 consist of knot diagrams up to isotopy and up to reidemeister moves of type ii and iii ( this is called usually _ regular isotopy _ of non singular knots ) . the points in @xmath0 project to immersed long planar curves .",
    "it is easy to see that the connected components of @xmath0 are in 1 - 1 correspondence with the regular homotopy classes of immersed long planar curves ( standard at infinity ) .",
    "it is well known that the latter are in 1 - 1 correspondence with their whitney index @xmath14 ( i.e. the degree of the gauss map ) .",
    "one easily sees that @xmath0 is a disjoint union of contractible spaces ( numbered by the whitney index ) .",
    "the strata of codimension one @xmath15 of the discriminant are called the _",
    "walls_. they correspond to the knots which have exactly one ordinary double point as the only singularity .",
    "an ordinary double point of an oriented knot can be resolved in two different ways ( compare fig .",
    "a wall is called _ inessential _ if the two adjacent chambers coincide .",
    "the union of all inessential walls is denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "the space @xmath16 is called the _ essential diagram space _ and denoted by @xmath5 . a generic path in @xmath5",
    "is called a _ framed homotopy_.    we could associate to each connected component of @xmath0 a stratified space in the following way : the chambers of @xmath0 correspond to vertices .",
    "each stratum @xmath17 in @xmath15 corresponds to an edge connecting the vertices corresponding to chambers adjacent to @xmath17 .",
    "each stratum @xmath18 in @xmath19 gives rise to a 2-cell glued to all edges and vertices corresponding to those strata @xmath17 and those chambers which are adjacent to @xmath18 .",
    "and we can go on by gluing cells of dimension @xmath14 corresponding to strata of codimension @xmath14 .    the resulting space is not a cw - complex because it is not locally finite .",
    "( it is well known that there are e.g. infinitely many knot types of unknotting number one . )",
    "however , this space is evidently still simply connected .",
    "let us now consider the closure @xmath1 in a component of @xmath0 of the union of all inessential walls ( i.e. we add all adjacent strata of higher codimension ) .",
    "this space is a rather mysterious object .",
    "for example , it seems not to be known wether or not the strata of @xmath2 correspond always to `` nugatory crossings '' ( for the definition see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , i do not know wether or not the complement of @xmath1 is still connected in each component of @xmath0 .",
    "the two knots shown in fig.2 are not framed homotopic in @xmath5 .    .",
    "but notice that the two knots shown in fig.3 are framed homotopic in @xmath5 .",
    "the path is shown in the figure too .",
    "it uses the fact that the `` figure eight '' knot can be unknotted both by a positive or a negative crossing change .",
    "so , we do not know much about the components of the essential diagram space besides the fact that each component becomes simply connected ( even contractible ) if we add again the closure of the non - essential walls @xmath1 .    in this paper we describe a surprising phenomen : _ there are components of the essential diagram space which have non - trivial first homology groups_. this result is far from beeing obvious and we do not know any other method to prove this .",
    "( in finite dimensions this would imply by alexander duality that @xmath1 contains a cycle of codimension two in @xmath0 and this cycle is not homologically trivial in @xmath1 . )    our prove uses a 1-cocycle which is constructed in the following way : let @xmath20 be a singular knot and let @xmath21 $ ] be the extension of the jones polynomial for singular links contained in @xcite ( abusing notation we denote a knot diagram for @xmath20 by @xmath20 too ) .",

    "let @xmath28 be a generic path in @xmath9 which connects a given non singular knot with the unknot . here",
    ", the end points of the paths are allowed to move inside the chambers .",
    "a generic homotopy of such a path meets the codimension two part @xmath19 of the discriminant in a finite number of points which correspond to knots with exactly two ordinary double points or with exactly one ordinary cusp or with exactly one double point with equal tangent directions ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we define a _ co - orientation _ on @xmath15 by saying that the positive normal direction corresponds to changing a negative crossing to a positive one .",
    "the path @xmath28 intersects @xmath15 transversally in a finite number of points .",
    "let @xmath29 be such an intersection point . abusing notation we denote the corresponding double point by @xmath29 too and we denote the corresponding singular knot by @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath31 be the intersection index of @xmath28 with @xmath15 at @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath28 be an oriented path in @xmath5 which connects a non singular knot @xmath20 with a diagram of the unknot .",
    "the polynomial @xmath32 $ ] is defined by the following formula    @xmath33 .",
    "it follows immediately from the definitions that the intersection index of @xmath34 is an invariant of paths @xmath28 in @xmath5 up to homotopy in @xmath5 , if the end points of the paths are fixed up to regular isotopy .",
    "consequently , the writhe of the unknot at the end of the path @xmath28 is completely determined by the writhe @xmath27 of the knot @xmath20 and by the intersection index @xmath35 .",
    "the whitney index is invariant under crossing changes .",
    "( as well known , non singular knots are regularly isotopic if and only if they are isotopic and they share the same writhe and the same whitney index , compare e.g. @xcite . ) in particular , the intersection index of each loop with @xmath15 is zero .",
    "let @xmath28 be an oriented loop in @xmath5 .",
    "then the value of @xmath36 depends only on the homology class of @xmath28 .",
    "the induced cohomology class @xmath37 \\in h^1(\\mathcal { m}_{ess } ; \\mathbb{z}[a , a^{-1}])$ ] is non trivial .",
    "we describe now the first loop @xmath28 in @xmath5 for which @xmath36 is non - trivial ( we could not find a simpler example ) .",
    "let us consider the knots @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( from the knot atlas ) with their standard diagrams .",
    "they are both amphicheiral .",
    "each of them can be unknotted by either a positive or a negative crossing change .",
    "let @xmath20 be the connected sum @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 be the homotopy which unknots @xmath20 by a positive crossing change ( i.e. @xmath42 ) of @xmath38 and by a negative crossing change ( i.e. @xmath43 ) of @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath44 be the homotopy which unknots @xmath20 by a negative crossing change of @xmath38 and by a positive crossing change of @xmath39 .",
    "a calculation by hand gives the following result :    @xmath45 .",
    "here @xmath46 denotes the usual kauffman bracket .",
    "notice that the diagrams of @xmath38 and @xmath39 have vanishing writhe .",
    "hence , the kauffman bracket coincides with the jones polynomial ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . we could change @xmath20 by reidemeister moves of type i and consider the induced loop @xmath47 .",
    "the value of @xmath36 would change just by a standard factor .",
    "this shows that these components of @xmath5 are non - simply connected too .    the framed long knot @xmath20",
    "( i.e. the diagram @xmath20 or like - wise the smooth submanifold @xmath10 ) in our example has unknotting number two .",
    "the value of @xmath36 looks like the product of some standard polynomial ( which depends only on the unknotting number of @xmath20 ) with a linear combination of jones polynomials of those knots of unknotting number one which are contained in the loop .",
    "it seems to be very difficult to prove this in general .",
    "but it leads us to the following conjecture .",
    "let @xmath20 be a framed long knot of unknotting number one .",
    "let @xmath41 be a homotopy which unknots @xmath20 and such that @xmath48 ( respectively @xmath49 ) .",
    "then @xmath50 is invariant under regular isotopy of @xmath20 .",
    "notice that apriori the intersection of the closure of the connected component of @xmath20 in @xmath5 with the closure of the component of the unknot could have an infinite number of connected components .",
    "each of these components corresponds to an unknotting of @xmath20 and they could be all different !    we have verified this conjecture by hand for all diagrams with no more than 6 crossings ( which is not a big deal ) .",
    "@xmath51    @xmath52    @xmath53    @xmath54 .",
    "here @xmath55 is the writhe and @xmath14 is the whitney index of the diagram which we unknot .",
    "@xmath56 is the right trefoil and @xmath57 is its mirror image , the left trefoil .",
    "our theorem shows that the situation is more complicated already for framed knots of unknotting number two .",
    "the corresponding conjecture would be that @xmath50 is now well defined up to combinations of jones polynomials of framed knots with unknotting number one .",
    "there is an extension of the homfly - pt polynomial for singular links by kauffman and vogel @xcite .",
    "a natural idea would be to replace in the construction of @xmath36 the singular kauffman bracket @xmath26 by their singular homfly - pt polynomial .",
    "surprisingly , this fails .",
    "we can not replace @xmath26 by our singular alexander polynomial @xmath58 neither ( see @xcite and the next section ) .    crossing an inessential wall does not change the knot type but it changes the framing .",
    "if we would replace framed isotopy by isotopy then our construction would just lead to a version of the jones polynomial ( as it happened in the first version of the present paper ) .",
    "let @xmath28 be a generic path in the essential diagram space @xmath5 ( i.e. a framed homotopy ) .",
    "first we observe that @xmath36 is invariant under all homotopies of @xmath28 which do not change the intersection with the strata of the discriminant @xmath11 .",
    "this comes from the fact that @xmath59 is an isotopy invariant of framed singular knots ( i.e. only reidemeister moves of type ii and iii and the additional moves for singular links @xmath60 and @xmath61 are allowed , compare @xcite and also @xcite ) .",
    "next we need some simple facts from singularity theory which can be proven with the same methods as e.g. in the appendix of @xcite or @xcite .",
    "only the following _ accidents _ can occure in a generic homotopy of a path @xmath28 in @xmath5 and they can occure only a finite number of times .",
    "we show the diagrams for the meridional loop of @xmath62 in fig .",
    "5 . after smoothing the crossings and the double points we are left with exactly the four diagrams @xmath68 shown in fig .",
    "6 . they are in general independent . the meridional loop @xmath67 of @xmath62 leads to the following equations :                  notice that it could happen that exactly one of the four strata of @xmath15 in fig .",
    "5 is non essential . in this case",
    "we could not push our path @xmath28 in @xmath5 through the corresponding stratum of @xmath62 by a small homotopy .",
    "our theorem implies that sometimes we can not even do it by a big homotopy .",
    "@xmath74 follows from the invariance of @xmath79 under the move @xmath80 for singular links ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "( we had to choose in fig .",
    "8 a type of a reidemeister ii move and orientations on the branches .",
    "taking mirror images or changing orientations of branches leads to the same result . )",
    "the stratum of an ordinary triple point is not smooth .",
    "but one easily sees that the meridians form theta - graphs . using the invariance of @xmath81 under passing @xmath63 it suffices to prove the invariance for the loops in just one of the theta graphs ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "the three arcs @xmath82 in the theta - graph are shown in fig .",
    "10,11 and 12 .",
    "it suffices hence to prove that @xmath83 .",
    "we show the calculation of @xmath84 in fig .",
    "the first equality in fig .",
    "12 uses twice the fact that @xmath81 is invariant under passing @xmath62 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath85 is completely analogous and is left to the reader .",
    "it is clear that we can replace homotopy by homology in all our constructions because the values are in a commutative ring .",
    "we have proven that @xmath36 depends only on the homology class of @xmath28 in @xmath5 .",
    "the example in the introduction shows that @xmath81 induces a non trivial cohomolgy class .",
    "the theorem is proven .",
    "it remains to prove our assertion from remark 1 .",
    "we recall the definition of the singular homfly - pt polynomial from @xcite in fig . 13 . here",

    "we want to replace @xmath79 by this polynomial .",
    "a calculation for the meridional loop of @xmath62 leads to the equation shown in fig .",
    "14 , which has the unique solution @xmath87 .",
    "but then the singular homfly - pt polynomial is no longer sensitive for crossing changes of links .",
    "the failure of the singular alexander polynomial from @xcite is also caused by the stratum @xmath62 .",
    "it leads to the equation @xmath88 , which makes the invariant uninteresting .",
