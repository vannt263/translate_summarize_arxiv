    "though the standard model ( sm ) has obtained great success in explaining the phenomena of particle physics , the mass spectra of quarks and leptons still remains a profound mystery .",
    "the existence of massive neutrinos is a challenge to sm . to understand the mass spectra and mixing of quarks and leptons , three family majorana neutrinos and family gauge symmetry @xmath5",
    "have been introduced as a simple extension to sm@xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on the @xmath6 processes with such new gauge interaction .",
    "the current neutrino experiments @xcite can be well described by neutrino oscillation via the mixing of three neutrinos@xcite .",
    "the global fit leads to tiny neutrino masses and large mixing@xcite .",
    "phenomenologically , such mixing angles are consistent with the so - called tri - bimaximal mixing with @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which was first proposed by harrison , perkins , and scott@xcite .",
    "as the mixing matrix is symmetric , many theoretical efforts have been made to obtain such a mixing matrix via imposing various symmetries , especially the discrete symmetries , which in general lead @xmath9 .",
    "recently , it was shown that the tri - bimaximal matrix may be regarded as the lowest order approximation of the neutrino mixing matrix , where the mixing angle @xmath10 is nonzero and can be tested experimentally@xcite . with three family neutrinos ,",
    "the gauge family symmetry @xmath0 instead of discrete symmetries was discussed in@xcite . in this case",
    ", the tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing matrix can be obtained as the lowest order approximation from diagonalizing a symmetric mass matrix@xcite .",
    "as the higgs boson has not been confirmed yet , the electro - weak ( ew ) symmetry breaking mechanism is unclear .",
    "one can suppose the family gauge symmetry spontaneously violates with the ew symmetry , which implies different yukawa terms from those in sm as shown in@xcite .",
    "we work with the low energy effective lagrangian after the gauge symmetries breaking , and discuss the effect of the new gauge interaction to the mass differences of the neutral mesons .",
    "when the family gauge symmetry is introduced , there will be flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) at tree level , especially the @xmath6 processes .",
    "the mass difference has been observed in the neutral pseudo - scalar meson systems , denoted as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 refers to @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "we focus on the contribution of the new @xmath6 fcnc operators to the mass difference , and study the mass bounds of the @xmath5 family gauge bosons .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ section_ffbar ] ,",
    "we review the mass difference of the neutral mesons in sm . in section [ section_so3 ]",
    ", we introduce the effective hamiltonian of @xmath0 family gauge interaction and list the corresponding hadronic matrix elements .",
    "we give the numerical results in section [ section_num ] and a short conclusion in section [ section_conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we give a brief review about the mass difference of @xmath11 system . in sm",
    "if only the strong and electromagnetic interactions exist , i.e. @xmath17 , @xmath12 and @xmath18 would be stable as the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath19 with same mass @xmath20 .",
    "when the hamiltonian @xmath21 of weak interaction is considered , @xmath12 and @xmath18 will mix together and decay to the same final states .",
    "@xmath11 mixing is responsible for the mass difference between the mass eigenstates . in sm",
    ", it is known that the neutral meson mixing arises from the box diagrams through two @xmath22 boson exchange .",
    "the fcnc processes involve heavy quarks via loops and consequently they are perfect testing ground for heavy flavor physics .",
    "the small mass difference of the neutral @xmath23 and @xmath24 imposes severe constraints to new physics beyond sm , especially to those with fcnc at tree level .",
    "the phenomenon of @xmath11 mixing is important for it is relating to the @xmath25 violation .",
    "with wigner - weisskopf approximation@xcite , the wave function describing the oscillation and decay of @xmath11 is @xmath26 which evolves according to a schrdinger - like equation @xmath27 where @xmath28 the matrices @xmath29 and @xmath30 are given , in second - order perturbation theory , by summing over intermediate states @xmath31 , @xmath32 the result of the mixing is @xmath33 where the @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) is the mass ( width ) difference . the processes for @xmath11 mixing in sm have been studied extensively and can be found in @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the mass differences are@xcite @xmath36 the low energy effective interaction in sm provides a good approximation to @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and also gives acceptable result of @xmath39 where the non - perturbation effect can not be ignored .",
    "however the value of @xmath40 in sm is only @xmath41gev .",
    "it is because the @xmath4 system is different from the @xmath42 and @xmath1 , where the internal quarks in the box diagrams are down - type quarks .",
    "since the mass differences of the down - type quarks are much smaller than that of the up - type quarks , the gim mechanism@xcite works much efficiently for @xmath43 meson than that for @xmath23 and @xmath44 mesons .",
    "furthermore , owing to the small cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) angles the coupling to the third family is negligible , such that effectively only the first two generations play a role , making the gim mechanism even more efficient to @xmath4 system .    as the short - distance effect in sm is small , it is suitable to study other effect in @xmath4 system , such as the long - distance effects , which are difficult to calculate due to the non - perturbation , or some new physics effects . in this paper",
    "we assume the short - distance effect of new physics is dominated to @xmath45 , and discuss the possible family gauge boson contribution .",
    "the lagrangian about the interactions of quarks and the gauge bosons of @xmath5 is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the new gauge coupling and @xmath48 the @xmath49 are the generators of the @xmath0 group and @xmath50 are the gauge fields . after the gauge symmetry breaking ,",
    "the fermions get mass .",
    "to diagonalize the mass matrix of quarks , one needs transformations of the quark fields from interaction eigenstates to mass eigenstates , @xmath51 with the mass eigenstates , the lagrangian can be re - expressed as @xmath52 where @xmath53 the @xmath54s and @xmath55s are not independent , since the @xmath56 and @xmath57 are combined to ckm matrix , @xmath58 in general , each of the three unitary matrixes @xmath56 , @xmath57 or @xmath59 has eight parameters , i.e. , three mixing angles and five phases .",
    "only two unitary matrixes are independent according eq.([eq_ckm ] ) , thus there are 16 independent parameters to be input . in sm , only the ckm matrix appears in the lagrangian . due to the re - phase invariance of the ckm matrix , only one phase has physical effect , and the others can be moved to @xmath56 and @xmath57 which do not appear in sm .",
    "however , @xmath56 and @xmath57 appears in the new gauge interactions in eq.([eq_so3lagarangian ] ) .    from the lagrangian given in eq.([eq_lagarangian ] ) , one can get the effective hamiltonian for the @xmath6 processes , @xmath60 the @xmath61 is from the box diagrams in sm , while the @xmath62 is from the new gauge interactions , @xmath63 at tree level , the wilson coefficients are @xmath64 due to the color suppression , one has @xmath65 at tree level .",
    "the @xmath66 is the contribution from the new operators whose hadronic matrix elements are given by , @xmath67 \\left[(v - a)+(v+a)\\right]\\rangle,\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\langle(v - a)(v - a)\\rangle+\\langle(v - a)(v+a)\\rangle\\right].\\label{eq_vv_factorization}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the factorizations of the hadron matrix elements are listed as follows , @xmath68 where the factor @xmath69 and the @xmath70 is the average mass of the @xmath12 and @xmath18 . @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the mass of the quarks which are the components of the meson .",
    "@xmath73 is the decay constant and @xmath74s are the bag parameters which are unit in naive factorization@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that to get eq.([eq_vv_factorization ] ) the following equations have been used , @xmath75 as one knows the strong interaction preserves the chiral symmetry , the hadronic matrix elements of right - hand operators will be the same as the left - hand operators .",
    "in our calculation , the following inputs are adopted .",
    "@xmath76gev , @xmath77gev , @xmath78 , and the mass@xcite , decay constants@xcite and the bag parameters @xcite are listed in table.([table_input ] ) .",
    "the ckm matrix @xmath79 is parameterized@xcite with @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 . with such inputs ,",
    "the results of the mass differences @xmath84 in sm are listed as follows , @xmath85 the first uncertain comes from the decay constant , and the second comes from the bag parameter .",
    "one can find that the results are close to the experimental values . in the following we consider the new physics effect in eq.([eq_ff_np ] ) .",
    "first , for simplicity one can assume the mixing matrix of the down - type quarks is unit , and the the mixing matrix of up - type quarks is @xmath87 .",
    "the free parameters are only the gauge coupling @xmath47 and the mass of the gauge bosons .",
    "since the effect of new physics is proportional to the @xmath88 , one can get the upper limits from @xmath89 , @xmath90 if the gauge interaction coupling constant is fixed , the above limits give lower limits of the gauge boson mass as plotted in fig.([fig_bound ] ) .",
    "when the new gauge coupling constant is taken as strong as the weak interaction in sm , @xmath91 , one can get the mass limits which are @xmath92tev , @xmath93tev , and @xmath94tev .",
    "so we get the scale of the new interactions about @xmath95tev , in addition to @xmath96mev and @xmath97gev in sm .",
    "we take the limits in eq.([eq_bound ] ) as input and get the @xmath4 mass difference @xmath98 where the first uncertain is from the decay constant and the others are from the bag parameters @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "one can find that our result is consistent with the experimental values .",
    "finally , we consider another approximation . as",
    "the off - diagonal elements of ckm matrix are small , @xmath101 the @xmath56 and @xmath57 are equal at leading order , @xmath102 according to eq.([eq_down_mixing],[eq_up_mixing ] ) , one can get @xmath103 the @xmath4 is related with @xmath104 which is expressed as @xmath105 and the @xmath1 is related with @xmath106 .    at the leading order ,",
    "as @xmath107 one has wilson coefficients @xmath108 the imaginary part of the coefficient is relating with the @xmath25 violation in @xmath1 system which is detected@xcite as @xmath109 .",
    "the imaginary part is small which implies the phase @xmath110 is close to @xmath111 or @xmath112 . in fig.([fig_ddkk ] ) , the plot of the @xmath40 and @xmath113 with the same @xmath114 is shown . from the plot one can get two solutions , @xmath115 taking the two solutions as input , one can get the @xmath40 , @xmath116     and @xmath113 .",
    "the dashed line is the experimental value of @xmath39 ]",
    "as one knows that if the mass of the sm higgs lies between 130 and 200gev@xcite , the sm can be valid at energy scales all the way up to plank scale .",
    "but it seems unnatural if there is a very large desert from electro - weak scale to plank scale . when the family gauge symmetry is introduced , there are fcnc at tree level especially the @xmath6 processes and more cp violation sources which are very interesting to flavor physics . in this paper",
    "we study the effect of the new gauge interaction to the mass difference of the @xmath11 systems .",
    "we get the scale of the new gauge interaction at about @xmath118tev in addition to the the gauge scales in sm . with the constrain from @xmath1 and @xmath119 , a result of @xmath45 consistent to the experimental data is gotten . in this paper , only the new physics effect at tree level is considered to get a simple constrain to the scale of the new gauge bosons . to get more precise results , the qcd corrections to the new operators and the long - distance effect",
    "should be considered .",
