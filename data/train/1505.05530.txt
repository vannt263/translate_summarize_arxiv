    "the erlangen programme ( see @xcite ) was above all an affirmation of the key role of groups in geometry .",
    "klein writes : `` in the following third part of my collected works ... are those papers involving the concept of continuous group of transformations '' .",
    "he announced the main aspects of his programme as follows : `` given a manifold and a transformation group acting on it , to investigate those properties of figures on that manifold which are invariant under all transformations of that group . ''    in modern language , we could say that each geometry or geometrical structure is fully characterized by a subgroup of the diffeomorphism group .",
    "different realizations of the same group give rise to isomorphic geometrical structures or geometries , i.e. , a `` geometry '' is associated with an abstract ( lie ) group and not with a specific realization .    therefore , a geometrical description of quantum mechanics should identify an associated group . in this paper , to be able to deal with finite dimensional lie groups and corresponding geometrical structures we shall restrict our considerations to systems with finite dimensional manifolds of observable and states",
    ". our presentation should be thought of as providing guidelines to deal with the more realistic situation of infinite dimensional states , which would require a theory of infinite dimensional lie groups , not fully available at present time .",
    "the main point of our paper is that if one takes the @xmath0-algebraic approach to quantum mechanics , the general complex linear group of transformations emerges as a more fundamental group than its maximal compact subgroup of unitary transformations . to contextualize the search for the group to be associated with quantum mechanics",
    ", we shall consider the two main pictures usuallly encountered in the description of quantum systems , schrdinger s and heisenberg s , from a geometric perspective .",
    "we shall follow the construction which has been developed in the last years ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) . as a running example we shall consider the case of a two - level system ( or a qubit ) , and we shall discuss most of the emerging geometrical structures in this particular situation .",
    "in the schrdinger picture , the carrier space @xmath1 which represents the states of the model is the projective space corresponding to the hilbert space @xmath2 and , as such , a khler manifold .",
    "therefore the geometrical information of this picture is contained in a riemannian structure , a symplectic structure and a complex one , which are compatible .",
    "each two of them determines the third one .",
    "this is in agreement with the observation that for linear invertible transformations , @xmath3      the various algebraic structures take the form of tensors defined on the carrier space .",
    "thus we take the complex vector space of a @xmath4level quantum system @xmath5 and consider it as a khler manifold : a real vector space @xmath6 with a complex structure @xmath7 ( a @xmath8tensor field ) , a riemannian structure @xmath9 and a symplectic form @xmath10 , related as @xmath11 analogously we can consider the corresponding contravariant tensors @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "if we consider a two level system , the hilbert space corresponds to @xmath14 with the usual hermitian structure @xmath15    to consider it as a real vector space we can consider a basis and associated coordinates @xmath16 .",
    "the real carrier space becomes @xmath17 with coordinates @xmath18 , which are the real ( @xmath19 ) and imaginary ( @xmath20 ) parts of the complex coordinate @xmath21 , for @xmath22 . in these coordinates ,",
    "the expression of the tensors defining the khler structure would be as follows :    * the riemannian metric corresponds to an euclidean metric on @xmath23 : @xmath24or as a bidifferential operator , contravariant ( 0,2 ) tensor field : @xmath25 * analogously , the symplectic structure can be written as a 2-form @xmath26or as a poisson bivector field @xmath27 * finally , the complex structure is written as a ( 1 - 1 ) tensor field @xmath28    as for the operators on @xmath2 we can also translate them into tensorial terms in several ways .",
    "one of them is to define the quadratic functions corresponding to them and write , for any @xmath29 the associated function @xmath30    it is immediate to see that the quadratic functions corresponding to hermitian operators are real valued , in the general case they are complex .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath31 and @xmath32 the set of quadratic complex valued functions and the subset of quadratic real valued functions respectively .",
    "for instance , in our example @xmath33 we can consider the set of @xmath34 complex matrices which is a @xmath0algebra , @xmath35 and contains @xmath36 and the real elements correspond to hermitian matrices , which , after multiplication by the imaginary unit , would correspond to elements in @xmath37 .",
    "the quadratic functions corresponding to the pauli matrices , for instance , would be written as @xmath38    @xmath39    @xmath40    and @xmath41where @xmath42 , the identity matrix in two dimensions .",
    "on @xmath31 we can export the algebraic structures the set @xmath43 is endowed with :    * the natural lie algebra structure associated with the commutator @xmath44_{\\mathfrak{gl}}=(ab - ba ) $ ] is not the most convenient since it does not define a subalgebra structure on the set of hermitian operators .",
    "instead , we can consider @xmath45 = -i(ab - ba ) $ ] which does define a lie algebra structure on @xmath46 and that can be realized on @xmath47 by using the poisson tensor ( [ eq:24 ] ) : @xmath48}=\\omega ( df_{a},df_{b}):=\\{f_{a},f_{b}\\};\\qquad \\forall a , b\\in   \\mathrm{herm}(\\mathcal{h } ) .",
    "\\label{eq:42}\\]]last equation is defining a poisson bracket @xmath49 on @xmath50 . *",
    "the jordan structure associated to the anti - commutator @xmath51_{+}=ab+ba $ ] is realized by using the symmetric tensor ( [ eq:22 ] ) : @xmath52_{+}}=g(df_{a } , df_{b}):=\\ { f_{a } , f_{b}\\}_{+ } ; \\qquad \\forall a , b\\in \\mathfrak{gl}(\\mathcal{h}).\\ ] ] last equation is defining a jordan bracket @xmath53 on @xmath54 .",
    "this operation is inner on @xmath55 . *",
    "the associative product of @xmath43 can be written by using a combination of both operations above .",
    "thus as @xmath56_{+}+\\frac{i}{2}[a , b]$ ] , we can introduce then a @xmath57product on the quadratic functions @xmath58if we extend it by linearity , last equation is defining a new operation @xmath59 on @xmath60 , which is non - local and non - commutative , but it is associative .    with respect to these tensors , we can define two types of vector fields associated with quadratic functions ( and hence to the elements of @xmath61 :    * hamiltonian vector fields , associated with quadratic functions via the poisson structure : @xmath62 * and gradient vector fields associated with quadratic functions via the symmetric tensor @xmath12 : @xmath63    gradient vector fields associated with the pauli matrices via the quadractic functions on @xmath64 are given by : @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 while for the corresponding hamiltonian vector fieds we find @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 from the compatibility conditions ( eq .",
    "( [ eq:19 ] ) ) of the tensors of the khler structure , it is clear that @xmath71    we notice that the hamiltonian vector fields close on the lie algebra of @xmath72 while the three gradient vector fields transform like a vector under the action of the hamiltonian ones .",
    "the commutator of two gradient vector fields is not of gradient type , but it turns out to be a hamiltonian vector field .",
    "as it is well known the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics requires that ( pure ) states are described by rays and not by vectors .",
    "therefore the set of pure states is described by the complex projective space @xmath73 . to transfer the constructed tensorial description to the projective space we must first write the relevant objects in a geometric language . to this aim",
    ", we consider two vector fields    * the dilation vector field on @xmath2 , denoted as @xmath74 , which in coordinates @xmath75 reads @xmath76 * and the vector field @xmath77 , representing the global phase change on the hilbert space @xmath2 and which in local coordinates reads @xmath78    as they define an integrable distribution we can consider the corresponding foliation @xmath79 , the manifold of leaves represents @xmath80 in the geometric language .",
    "the corresponding fibration @xmath81 on the projective space identifies projectable tensors on @xmath82  as those which are defined on the space of pure states . with this identification",
    "we can avoid using the different charts required to work on @xmath79 ( as it is no longer a vector space ) , and use objects on @xmath2 , as long as they are projectable with respect to @xmath83 .",
    "both vector fields have interesting properties .",
    "just to mention some of them , we can consider their relations with respect to the khler structure :    * the norm of the vector fields @xmath84 and @xmath85 at any point equals the norm of the ( vector ) point at which they are evaluated , i.e. @xmath86 * analogously , the symplectic area generated by them at a point @xmath87 is equal to the norm of the vector ( point ) @xmath88 * the two vector fields are orthogonal with respect to @xmath9 : @xmath89 where we used the compatibility condition of the khler structure ( eq .",
    "( [ eq:19 ] ) ) .",
    "this is a general property for any two vector fields of the form @xmath90 and @xmath91 , they are always orthogonal to each other",
    ". we shall come back to this point later .",
    "* they are the gradient and hamiltonian vector fields associated to the quadratc function corresponding the identity matrix , i.e. , given @xmath92 , we have + @xmath93 + and @xmath94    in the example of the two level system , the projective space @xmath95 is diffeomorphic to the sphere @xmath96 , and the corresponding fibration @xmath97 is a generalization of the hopf fibration @xmath98 .    thus although we can represent the observables by means of functions , they can not be those given by eq . ( [ eq:41 ] ) .",
    "indeed they are not projectable , since they are not homogeneous of degree zero : @xmath99a possible way out is to use a conformal factor : @xmath100 .",
    "notice that these functions contain the spectral information of the operator to which they are associated .",
    "indeed , it is immediate to verify that    * the eigenvectors of the operator @xmath101 correspond to the critical points of the function @xmath102 , * the values of the function @xmath102 at the critical point is precisely the eigenvalue at the corresponding eigenvector up to a factor @xmath103 .",
    "for instance , if we consider the function @xmath104 its critical points are obtained as those points @xmath105 satisfying @xmath106 the first critical set represents the eigenspace @xmath107 while the last one represents the eigenspace @xmath108 .    in",
    "what concerns the tensors associated to the khler structure of @xmath2 it is evident again that they can not be directly projected .",
    "indeed , if we consider the contravariant tensors @xmath12 and @xmath109 , we notice that they are homogeneous of degree -2 : @xmath110and therefore they can not be projected onto @xmath79 .",
    "instead , we can consider alternative degenerate tensor fields as @xmath111and @xmath112these tensor fields at @xmath113 are clearly homogeneous of degree zero and invariant under the action of @xmath84 and hence they are projectable . the factors containing @xmath114 and @xmath115 , are chosen to make them correspond to the tensors of the canonical khler structure of the projective space .",
    "from the relations seen above it is immediate to verify that one - forms associated to the vector fields @xmath84 and @xmath115 by the symplectic or the riemannian structures are in the kernel of @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "indeed , consider the mappings @xmath118 @xmath119and analogously @xmath120 @xmath121associated with @xmath115 and @xmath114 we have their riemannian or symplectic dual forms , which can be seen to be related via @xmath122 : @xmath123and analogously @xmath124 the way @xmath84 and @xmath85 appear in @xmath116 and @xmath125 ensures that @xmath126 and @xmath127 are in their kernels .",
    "with respect to these tensors , we can also characterize functions @xmath102 ( eq . ( [ eq:48 ] ) ) as the functions on @xmath128 which are the pullback of functions on @xmath80 such that their associated hamiltonian fields are also killing .",
    "we shall denote the set of these functions as @xmath129 .",
    "we can also study the gradient and hamiltonian vector fields of the set of functions @xmath130 with respect to these projectable tensors .",
    "we should consider then vector fields as @xmath131 for gradient vector fields and @xmath132 for hamiltonian ones .",
    "for the example of the two level system we obtain : @xmath133    @xmath134    @xmath135    for the gradient vector fields and",
    "@xmath136    @xmath137    @xmath138    for the hamiltonian ones",
    ".    these vector fields are tangent to the three dimensional sphere @xmath139 of normalized vectors .",
    "a remarkable property of these vector fields is that either one of the two families @xmath140 or @xmath141 , after projection , span the tangent bundle of the sphere @xmath96 .",
    "besides , as we saw above , they are pairwise orthogonal to each other , i.e. @xmath142    another interesting property which we will use in the following is the fact that the lie algebra generated by the union of both families , i.e. the lie algebra generated by @xmath143 is isomorphic to the special lie algebra @xmath144 ( also isomorphic to the lie algebra of the lorentz group ) .",
    "if we consider the algebra generated by the vector fields defined on @xmath145 , we see that @xmath146 generate again the lie algebra @xmath144 . if we include the vector fields @xmath147 and @xmath148 , the set generates the full @xmath149 .    as a curiosity we can study the flow associated to these fields .",
    "for instance , if we consider vector fields @xmath150 and @xmath151 and represent their flows from an initial condition @xmath152 we obtain the flows presented in figures [ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] .    in figure [ fig:1 ]",
    "we can see how the flow takes us towards one of the eigenspaces of the operator @xmath153 , in particular the one generated by @xmath154 . in this particular numerical example",
    "the limit point is @xmath155 and @xmath156 , with the remaining two coordinates vanishing , i.e. , the system is selecting the eigenvector @xmath157 .",

    "notice that if we consider only the hamiltonian vector fields @xmath293 with @xmath289 they generate the lie algebra of the special unitary group @xmath294 , they obviously define an involutive distribution .",

    "if we consider the distribution generated by the gradient vector fields , we can verify immediately that it is not involutive , since the commutator of two gradient vector fields is a hamiltonian vector field and therefore the operation is not inner .",
    "besides , the distribution generated by the gradient vector fields is tangent to the surface of the outmost sphere in @xmath300 , but not to the spheres in the interior of the ball . with respect to them , in general it will be transversal .",
    "the situation is different if we consider the projection @xmath263 .",
    "indeed , it is immediate to notice that vector fields @xmath85 and @xmath84 are annihilated by the projection @xmath301 and hence on the immage by @xmath256 there are only six generators @xmath302 for @xmath303 and where @xmath304    therefore on the submanifold @xmath305 we can consider only the action of the group @xmath306 , whose lie algebra is generated by the vector fields @xmath302 for @xmath303 .",
    "analogously , when considering the integrable distribution generated by the hamiltonian vector fields @xmath307 for @xmath303 , we identify the orbit of the special unitary group @xmath308 .",
    "this change in the global group to @xmath309 when considering the complex projective space ( both as a manifold or as its image by @xmath256 ) is also reflecting a quite remarkable property , namely the nonlocality of the product @xmath57 which encodes the associative product of operators .",
    "indeed , we already explained that it is via this product how we can build a @xmath0algebra structure on the space of functions @xmath310 .",
    "thus we can write @xmath311 where we must keep in mind that the product is associative and non - local . thus @xmath312 ( i.e. , the complexification of the algebra of functions generated by hermitian operators ) becomes a @xmath0-algebra .",
    "now , if we consider the automorphisms of this algebra , we will identify the whole group @xmath313 acting on @xmath314 as automorphisms with respect to the @xmath57 operation , i.e. , transformations of the type @xmath315 as this product is non - local , transformations on functions do not induce transformations on the space on which they are defined .",
    "in other terms , infinitesimal generators of one parameter subgroups will not be derivations of the pointwise product of functions , therefore we will not have vector fields associated to them as infinitesimal generators .",
    "we saw in the previous section how the momentum mapping allows us to map the schrdinger picture on the heisenberg one .",
    "let us see now how the gns construction allows us to move in the other direction , i.e. , from the heisenberg picture we will recover the schrdinger one .",
    "the starting point is thus a @xmath0algebra @xmath316 which contains the set of physical observables as a real subspace .",

    "@xmath317 as @xmath335    as we know that the set of states @xmath336 can be embedded in @xmath316 , the expression above implies that the hilbert space @xmath337 may be thought of as a subspace of @xmath316 coinciding with the orbit of the left action of @xmath316 on itself which passes through @xmath317 , once identified with an element of @xmath316 ( remember that we are in finite dimension ) : @xmath338    this can also be done for any other element of @xmath337 :    given @xmath339 , a vector @xmath340 is said to be * cyclic * if the orbit @xmath341 is dense in @xmath329 .",

    "when we consider it as a lie algebra and exponentiate it we get the complex general lie group @xmath369 .",

    "when the group is realized as a group of matrices , similarity transformations with respect to the linear group will take from one realization of @xmath370 to a different realization , and consequently , from one hermitian structure to a different one on the vector space carrying the given realization .",

    "in finite dimensions the two groups do determine each other . as we have argued , for the complex projective space ( the space of pure states ) , i.e. , the two dimensional sphere for the two - level system , both groups act transitively on it .",
    "the unitary group acts by preserving the relevant structures while the complexification does not .    within the space of mixed states",
    "the two groups have different orbits .",
    "the stratification by the rank which is natural on the space of mixed states shows that each stratum is the union of different orbits of the unitary group while each stratum is an orbit of a proper defined action of the general complex linear group which acts in a non linear manner to preserve the trace .",
    "the infinitesimal generators of this action have an important interpretation in the framework of the markovian dynamics for open quantum systems .",
    "therefore we maintain that , in the realistic setting of open quantum systems , the complexification of the unitary group seems to be more relevant than the unitary group itself . with this claim in mind ,",
    "it is quite natural to consider this group as the relevant group of quantum mechanics in the ideology of the klein s programme .",
    "in addition , if we priviledge the @xmath0algebra approach , the general complex linear group emerges also as the exponentiated version of the @xmath0algebra thought of as a lie algebra . in the following section",
    "we shall investigate the geometrical aspects of the general linear group .",
    "as we just saw the group @xmath371 seems to arise naturally from the geometric structures of an open quantum system .",
    "let us study its geometry in more detail .",
    "as in the geometrical approach we are considering the hilbert space as a real vector space , our ingredients are a vector space @xmath145 , a linear space structure encoded in a liouville operator @xmath85 and a complex structure @xmath7 ( i.e. , a @xmath8 tensor field @xmath7 which satisfies that @xmath372 ) compatible with @xmath85 in the sense that @xmath373    we can consider the group @xmath371 as the ( finite dimensional ) subgroup of the diffeomorphism group of the set @xmath2 which keeps invariant the liouville operator @xmath85 and the complex structure @xmath7 .",
    "thus @xmath374 as a consequence , these transformations preserve also @xmath375 . the information on the projective space is already encoded here since it arises as the foliation generated by the integrable distribution generated by @xmath85 and @xmath376 ( the global phase generator ) .",
    "the following facts are easy to prove    * @xmath377 contains as a maximal compact subgroup the unitary group @xmath370 , * the complexification of the group @xmath378 is isomorphic to @xmath379 . *",
    "in addition , introducing the tangent and cotangent bundles of the unitary group , we have @xmath380 all three groups are symplectomorphic , the structure on @xmath381 being defined from the product of @xmath382 and the borel subgroup @xmath383 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we shall denote as @xmath61 and @xmath384 the corresponding lie algebras of these lie groups .      in what regards the lie algebra @xmath43 we have also some interesting properties which will be useful later .",
    "* as a matrix algebra , @xmath43 is an associative algebra with involution , corresponding to the adjoint operation @xmath385 . *",
    "second , @xmath43 carries a hilbert space structure defined by the scalar product @xmath386 if we restrict this operation to the subalgebra of the unitary group @xmath229 , it is immediate that it defines a non - degenerate metric .",
    "therefore it can be used to define an isomorphism between the algebra and its dual @xmath387 this is the inverse mapping with respect to eq .",
    "( [ eq:83 ] ) . *",
    "the diffeomorphisms connecting the group @xmath371 and the tangent and cotangent bundle of the unitary group @xmath378 have a simple translation at the level of lie algebras : @xmath388 the new equivalences arise from the isomorphism of the unitary algebra and its dual coming from the invertibility of the metric structure defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) .",
    "let us consider now the structure and properties of the space of physical states @xmath389 .",
    "we know that such a space is defined as a subset of the dual of the unitary lie algebra @xmath384 , defined as those matrices in @xmath390 which are positive definite and have trace equal to one , i.e. , @xmath391 and impose then the constraint on the trace .",
    "thus , we consider @xmath392 this view allows to derive many properties in simple terms .",
    "for instance , the left action of the group @xmath393 is then easily written : @xmath394 on the other hand , the right action of the unitary subgroup projects onto the identity , showing that @xmath395 is the base manifold of a @xmath396bundle .    when considered as an action on @xmath390 , @xmath397 changes the spectrum of @xmath398 , but it preserves its rank ( signature ) .",

    "it is simple to see that the action ( [ eq:37 ] ) does not preserve @xmath404 . indeed , for a general element @xmath405 @xmath406 therefore",
    ", we must modify the action @xmath397 to define an inner operation on the set of density states : @xmath407 as the action on @xmath408 preserves the rank , we know that the denominator can not vanish and therefore @xmath409 is well defined .",
    "it is immediate to verify that the action preserves the sets @xmath410 , i.e @xmath411 since the action @xmath397 preserves , by definition , the subsets of positive operators @xmath412 .",
    "both manifolds @xmath413 and @xmath399 become thus * stratified manifolds * , the strata being the subsets @xmath414 and @xmath412 , i.e. , the orbits of the corresponding action of the general linear group @xmath415 .",
    "the set @xmath416 corresponds to those hermitian operators which have only one eigenvalue different from zero , and therefore equal to one . these are clearly the projectors on one - dimensional subspaces of the hilbert space @xmath145 , and hence they are in one - to - one correspondence with the points of the projective space @xmath242 by the momentum map @xmath256 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq:85 ] ) .",
    "we studied in previous section how the hamiltonian and gradient vector fields defined different types of transformations on @xmath417 .",
    "as we saw , the set of hamiltonian vector fields were the fundamental vector fields corresponding to the action of the special unitary group ( subgroup of @xmath292 ) while together with the gradient vector fields they were the fundamental vector fields of the action of the special linear group @xmath306 .",
    "it is not possible to consider the action of the other generators of @xmath292 on @xmath417 , since the action of the generators associated to @xmath418 ( the vector fields which are associated via the momentum map @xmath255 with vector fields @xmath85 and @xmath84 ) act trivially on @xmath416 .",
    "a final comment is necessary with respect to the complex structure . on the projective space , or equivalently on the subset @xmath417",
    ", there is a canonical complex structure .",
    "therefore , we know that gradient and hamiltonian vector fields are in one - to - one correspondence defined by the tensor @xmath7 . therefore , the whole @xmath306orbit @xmath417 can be obtained from the complexification of the generators of the unitary group ( the hamiltonian vector fields ) .",
    "the situation for other strata is more complicated since , although we can still obtain the stratum from the hamiltonian and gradient vector fields , we lack of a properly defined complex structure on them to relate both sets ( see grabowski2005a , grabowski2006 ) .",
    "as we saw in the previous section , the left action of @xmath43 on itself corresponding to the associative product @xmath419 can be projected on @xmath420 : @xmath421    given a family of operators @xmath422 , we can consider the action on density states as @xmath423    the operator @xmath424 shall be called a * kraus map*. the kraus map is said to be normalized if @xmath425    the composition of two kraus maps is an inner operation .",

    "if a kraus map @xmath429 is invertible inside the set of kraus maps , there exists an element @xmath430 such that @xmath431      in this context we can also consider the dynamics for general markovian dynamics .",
    "it is well known that the most general markovian dynamical system takes the form of the kossakowski - lindblad superoperator @xmath432 defined as the infinitesimal generator of a one - parameter semigroup of transformations on @xmath224 ( see @xcite ) which takes the form @xmath433+\\frac 12    \\sum_{ij=1}^{n^{2}-1}c_{ij}\\left ( [ f_{i},\\rho      f_{j}^{\\dagger}]+[f_{i}\\rho , f_{j}^{\\dagger } ] \\right ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath434 defines a complex positive matrix , @xmath239 is hermitian and @xmath435 is traceless and satisfies that @xmath436 it is simple to see that such a transformation preserves the trace of @xmath345 but changes its spectrum .    we can rewrite the expression of @xmath432 in more geometrical terms and exhibit some of its properties in a more explicit way .",
