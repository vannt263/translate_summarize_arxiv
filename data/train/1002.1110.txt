    "the main numerical techniques for solving problems related to elliptic linear partial differential equations with variable coefficients in one way or another involve a discretization of a domain and solution of systems of thousands of algebraic equations .",
    "seldom the method of separation of variables is applied due to its natural limitations related to the requirements of a complete agreement between the geometry of the domain and the symmetry of the coefficients . moreover ,",
    "the method of separation of variables implies solution of sturm - liouville spectral problems which is not an easy task itself .    in the present paper",
    "we propose a different method based on some old and new results from pseudoanalytic function theory @xcite , @xcite .",
    "its applicability is not so universal as the applicability of the finite difference method or the finite element method .",
    "first of all , it is applicable to problems in bounded domains in the plane and up to now only for the operator @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , at present we can apply the method only when the equation @xmath5 possesses a particular solution @xmath6 such that the function @xmath7 is sufficiently smooth , nonvanishing in the domain of interest and representable in the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent an orthogonal coordinate system .",
    "this separable form of @xmath11 may cause associations with the method of separation of variables .",
    "nevertheless this is a completely different technique , based on different ideas and free of the mentioned above limitations of the method of separation of variables .",
    "the heart of the method is the construction of a complete system of solutions for ( [ maineqintro ] ) in the domain of interest , complete in the sense explained below ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.3 ) for related ideas and additional details ) .",
    "the system of solutions is used for approximating the solution of a boundary value problem . due to the linearity of equation ( [ maineqintro ] ) after the construction of the system of solutions the problem reduces to approximation of boundary conditions , for which a variety of methods can be used .",
    "here we apply the collocation method .",
    "the complete system of solutions is constructed in the following way .",
    "the knowledge of a particular solution of ( [ maineqintro ] ) allows us to propose a corresponding vekua equation @xcite closely related to ( [ maineqintro ] ) in the sense that the real part of any of its solutions has the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a solution of ( [ maineqintro ] ) , and vice versa given @xmath13 one can easily construct a corresponding solution of the vekua equation @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the relation between ( [ maineqintro ] ) and the vekua equation is similar to the relation between the laplace equation and the cauchy - riemann system .",
    "l. bers developed @xcite , @xcite a theory of so - called pseudoanalytic formal powers .",
    "they are generalizations of the analytic powers @xmath14 in the sense that they are solutions of the corresponding vekua equation and behave locally like the analytic powers .",
    "the theory of bers includes generalizations of taylor series , runge s theorem and other basic facts from analytic function theory .",
    "thus , under certain quite natural conditions the system of pseudoanalytic formal powers is complete in the space of all pseudoanalytic functions ( solutions of the vekua equation ) in the same sense as the system of powers @xmath14 is complete in the space of analytic functions . to construct the pseudoanalytic formal powers the knowledge of a corresponding generating sequence",
    "is required .",
    "recently @xcite , @xcite an algorithm for construction of generating sequences under additional conditions on the coefficients in the vekua equation was proposed .",
    "this implies that when @xmath15 is representable in a separable form the complete system of formal powers for the vekua equation associated with ( [ maineqintro ] ) can be constructed explicitly following bers recursive procedure .",
    "we investigate the efficiency of the proposed method which we call mpfp , the method of pseudoanalytic formal powers .",
    "we show its fast convergence and compare its accuracy with that of the finite element method . in general ,",
    "we show that in problems addmitting the explicit construction of formal powers and hence the application of the mpfp its use is advantageous compared to other computational techniques based on discretization of the problem .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the mpfp is a direct generalization of the method of harmonic polynomials for solving boundary value problems for the laplace equation which has been considered in dozens of works ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . indeed , in a special case when @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 the corresponding complete system of solutions constructed by means of the mpfp coincides with the system of harmonic polynomials @xmath19 .",
    "the knowledge of a complete system of solutions for an equation corresponding to any value of a spectral parameter allows one to use it for solving eigenvalue problems .",
    "we consider this possibility in section [ secteigen ] .",
    "the numerical results are highly promising , and it is clear that in the case of eigenvalue problems as well as for boundary value problems further work should be done in investigation of optimal ways of application of the mpfp .",
    "for example , for solving eigenvalue problems by means of the mpfp we used the simplest possible idea reducing the problem to calculation of zeros of a certain determinant obtained by evaluating the first @xmath20 solutions from the constructed complete system in @xmath20 points on the boundary of the domain under consideration .",
    "meanwhile , in principle , this natural approach works there exist other techniques offering different ways of using the available exact solution systems ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.13 ) , where similar questions are discussed ) .",
    "let @xmath22 be a domain in @xmath23 . throughout the whole paper",
    "we suppose that @xmath22 is a simply connected domain .",
    "denote @xmath24 and @xmath25 . by @xmath26",
    "we denote the operator of complex conjugation .",
    "note that the operator @xmath27 applied to a real valued function @xmath28 can be regarded as a kind of gradient , and if we know that @xmath29 in a whole complex plane or in a convex domain , where @xmath30 is a given complex valued function such that its real part @xmath31 and imaginary part @xmath32 satisfy the equation @xmath33 then we can reconstruct @xmath28 up to an arbitrary real constant @xmath34 in the following way@xmath35 where @xmath36 is an arbitrary fixed point in the domain of interest .",
    "note that this formula can be easily extended to any simply connected domain by considering the integral along an arbitrary rectifiable curve @xmath37 leading from @xmath36 to @xmath38@xmath39    by @xmath40 we denote the integral operator in ( [ antigr]):@xmath41(x , y)=2\\left (   \\int_{x_{0}}^{x}\\phi_{1}(\\eta , y)d\\eta + \\int_{y_{0}}^{y}\\phi_{2}(x_{0},\\xi)d\\xi\\right )   + c.\\ ] ] thus if @xmath42 satisfies ( [ casirot ] ) , there exists a family of real valued functions @xmath28 such that @xmath29 , given by the formula @xmath43 $ ] .",

    "the following natural question arises then .",
    "we know that given an arbitrary real valued harmonic function in a simply connected domain , a conjugate harmonic function can be constructed explicitly such that the obtained couple of harmonic functions represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex analytic function . what is the corresponding more general fact for solutions of associated elliptic equations ( [ maineq ] ) and ( [ assocmaineq ] ) ( which we slightly generalizing the definition of i. n. vekua call metaharmonic functions ) .",
