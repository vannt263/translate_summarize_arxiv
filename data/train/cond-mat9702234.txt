    "this generates a local potential @xmath2 at the position of the nucleus that lost the core - electron , which in turn acts on the ( noninteracting ) conduction - band electrons and affects the x - ray absorption probability .",
    "the situation is described by the hamiltonian @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the dispersion of the conduction band electrons , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) are annihilation and creation operators for the core - hole ( for conduction band electrons with wavevector @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 is the energy of the core state .",
    "as @xmath11 commutes with @xmath12 , the hilbert space splits into two sectors : in one the core - level is filled ( @xmath13 ) and there is no potential whereas in the other one the core level is empty ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath2 acts on the conduction electrons . as was shown in ref .",
    "the inner core disturbance acts as a transient one - body potential on the conduction electrons , which means that one needs to study the response of the conduction band electrons to the potential @xmath2 applied between times @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the x - ray absorption rate can be expressed by the golden rule as @xmath17 where @xmath18 annihilates a conduction - band electron at position @xmath19 at time @xmath0 , @xmath20 is the ground state at times @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",

    "= 0.9    in the present work we wish to investigate the analogous situation for integrable lattice models of strongly interacting conduction electrons in one dimension@xcite .",
    "these models are particular realizations of _ luttinger liquids _ and the x - ray problem for such systems has been investigated by various authors ( a detailed pedagocial discussion can be found in the forthcoming book@xcite ) . the case of a core potential with no backscattering was solved in refs .   and the case of a perfectly reflecting potential was treated in ref .  .",
    "the general case was investigated by affleck and ludwig @xcite using boundary conformal field theory ( bcft ) @xcite .",
    "recently , affleck @xcite reconsidered the x - ray problem for a fermi liquid ( [ hfermi ] ) for the case where @xmath2 has a bound state from the point of view of bcft .",
    "this motivated the present work in which we study the x - ray problem in hubbard and @xmath0-@xmath1 chains for core hole potentials with bound states .",

    "we model this situation by considering the hamiltonian @xmath38 where @xmath39 are one - body interactions acting on sites @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively . at time @xmath0 we switch off the core potential which changes the hamiltonian back to @xmath40 . depending on the precise form of the interactions @xmath39",
    "bound states can be formed at the boundaries . as the elementary excitations in the hubbard model are not electrons like in the case of the fermi liquid discussed above but ( anti)holons and spinons one has to consider several possibilities : in addition to the case in which there are no bound states the core - hole potential can bind either a spinon , a ( anti)holon , both a spinon and a ( anti)holon or , for an attractive boundary potential of the order of the hubbard interaction @xmath41 , a pair of electrons .",
    "in order to extract the x - ray exponent we use bcft and the fact that the low - energy spectrum of both hubbard and @xmath0-@xmath1 models can be described in terms of two @xmath42 conformal field theories or equivalently a spin and charge separated luttinger liquid @xcite .",
    "our discussion closely follows ref .  .",
    "we start by considering the luttinger liquid defined on the complex plane with coordinate @xmath43 . identifying the radial part of @xmath43 with the time variable the case of periodic boundary conditions ( a )",
    "is realized if we consider the complex plane without boundaries .",
    "the change to open boundary conditions ( b ) corresponds to the introduction of a cut in the plane from @xmath44 to @xmath45 .",
    "as explained above this change of boundary conditions corresponds to switching on ( and off ) the core - hole potential .",
    "choosing @xmath46 real and mapping the plane to a cylinder _ via _ the conformal transformation @xmath47 this cut gets mapped onto a seam in the time direction of the cylinder ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cyl ] ) .",
    "= 0.6    the green s function of an operator @xmath48 with dimension @xmath49 on the complex plane without boundaries is given by @xmath50 the green s function on the cylinder is obtained by the conformal mapping .",
    "for @xmath51 we obtain @xmath52 to study the edge singularity we choose @xmath53 to be an operator which changes the boundary conditions from a to b. the same correlation function can be evaluated alternatively by inserting a resolution of the identity in terms of the eigenstates @xmath54 of the system with reflecting boundary conditions @xmath55 the leading contribution to this sum comes from the ground state or a low lying excited state ( this depends on the operator @xmath48 because the form factor must be nonvanishing ) with boundary condition of type b. comparing the two expressions for the correlation functions on the cylinder allows one to extract the scaling dimensions of the boundary changing operator @xmath48 @xmath56 for boundary potentials that do not lead to bound states one identifies the exponents @xmath57 for the core - hole operator and @xmath58 for the core - hole conduction - electron operator ( @xmath59 being the ground state energies in the @xmath60-(@xmath61-)particle sector with b boundary conditions ) @xcite .",

    "we follow the steps outlined above to study the nature of the x - ray edge singularities in the @xmath0@xmath1 and hubbard models for boundary terms @xmath39 chosen in such a way that they preserve the integrability of these systems .",
    "in this section we determine the x - ray absorption exponents for a @xmath0-@xmath1 chain with the particular choice of core - hole potential described above .",
    "we consider the following hamiltonians @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 projects out double occupancies , @xmath65 are spin operators at site @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "there are three different forms for the boundary part @xmath69 of the hamiltonian that are compatible with integrability @xmath70 these correspond to localized potential ( a ) and magnetic ( b ) interactions of the conduction electrons with the disturbance due to the core hole .",
    "physically local magnetic field interactions are not very realistic ; one would rather expect a kondo - like interaction which we can not consider in the present framework of integrable lattice models . in what follows",
    "we therefore constrain our analysis to the model with aa boundary conditions .",
    "we note that in the continuum limit @xmath71 gives rise to forward scattering terms .",
    "we therefore expect that the x - ray exponents will generally not be universal despite the fact that our boundary is perfectly reflecting in the sense of refs .  .",
    "as we will se below this is indeed the case .",
    "however , the situation is somewhat more complicated than this : unlike in the continuum limit @xcite we do not impose neumann boundary conditions ( on the lattice wave functions ) .",
    "the boundary conditions should rather be thought of as being of mixed dirichlet - neumann type ( _ e.g. _ @xmath72 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath73 enters the finite - size spectrum in the same way as the forward scattering amplitude .",
    "therefore in the continuum limit the forward scattering amplitude is _ not _ simply given by the boundary chemical potential . as a result we recover the results of refs .   not for @xmath74 but for some finite value that depends on the band filling ( see below ) .    in the following we start by considering boundary fields in the region @xmath75 .",
    "this is unphysical from the point of view of the x - ray edge singularity where the potential due to the core hole should be attractive but permits a pedagogical discussion of the formalism we use to calculate the finite - size energies necessary for extracting x - ray exponents .      in this region of boundary fields",
    "holon boundary bound states at both boundaries are present in the ground state of the @xmath0-@xmath1 chain .",
    "defining @xmath76 the bethe ansatz equations with respect to the reference state with all spins up read @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "the energy of a state corresponding to a solution of ( [ bae ] ) is @xmath79 we now observe that for @xmath80 solutions of ( [ bae ] ) exists where ( in the thermodynamic limit ) two roots @xmath81 take the values @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively .",
    "these roots correspond to boundary bound states .",
    "the situation is analogous to the xxz heisenberg chain studied in ref .  .",
    "one finds that the ground state is given by a distribution of roots such that both these boundary roots are present .",
    "the logarithmic form of the bethe equations ( for a solution of ( [ bae ] ) with only real roots apart from the boundary roots ) reads @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the number of electrons with spin down , @xmath86 is the number of holes , @xmath87 are integer numbers , @xmath88 and @xmath89 in addition to ( [ baelog ] ) we still have two equations determining the precise values of the boundary roots . a detailed analysis of these equations yields that the corrections to the thermodynamic values in a finite system vanish exponentially with system size .",
    "this means that for the purposes of the present work we can neglect these corrections .",
    "we should note here that solutions of ( [ baelog ] ) do not yield a _",
    "complete _ set of states .",
    "for vanishing boundary fields such a basis can be constructed by means of the @xmath90 symmetry of the hamiltonian @xcite . for nonzero boundary fields",
    "this symmetry is broken and we do not known how to complement the set of bethe states given by solutions of ( [ baelog ] ) . however , for the present purposes this is not necessary : we are interested in the lowest energy state in a particular sector of quantum numbers and it can be shown that these states can always be obtained as solutions of ( [ baelog ] ) or the analogous equations based on the bethe ansatz reference state with all spins down .",
    "we note that this ceases to be true for the @xmath0-@xmath1 chain with ba or bb boundary terms .",
    "the calculation of the finite - size spectrum proceeds along the lines of refs .   and so that we merely quote the result @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the ground state energy of the infinite system , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the fermi velocities of holons and spinons respectively , @xmath95 is the dressed charge defined _ via _ @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the digamma function .",
