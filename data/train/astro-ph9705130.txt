    "due to its high x - ray brightness and its apparent large mass , cygnus  x-1 is the most studied galactic black - hole candidate ( bhc ) .",
    "although it is almost certain that the production of the high - energy radiation is associated with the accretion of matter , the exact details are uncertain .",
    "the source of accreting matter is most probably a combination of roche - lobe overflow and accretion out of the stellar wind of the companion , the o9.7iab supergiant hde  226868 ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent mass determinations give a mass of about 18@xmath7  for the companion and 10@xmath7  for the compact object ( @xcite , in agreement with @xcite and references therein ) , making the latter a good candidate for being a black hole .",
    "cyg  x-1 is usually observed in the so - called `` x - ray low , @xmath8-ray high '' state , which is roughly described by a power - law with a photon index @xmath9 , modified by an exponential cut - off with an @xmath10-fold energy of about 100  ( see @xcite for detailed reviews of the observations ) .",
    "the most popular model used for explaining the high - energy spectrum of cyg  x-1 ( and other bhcs ) , while in the `` low state , '' involves inverse comptonization of soft photons by a hot plasma , usually referred to as a corona .",
    "while the comptonization model by @xcite has been used widely in the past ( e.g.,@xcite ) , @xcite showed that the typical fit - parameters found for cyg  x-1 are outside the model s range of validity ( and can not be used for interpreting the physical conditions in the comptonizing medium ) , and he developed a more generalized theory . using a composite spectrum from exosat , granat , and osse observations , @xcite found that this new accretion disk corona ( adc ) model , having an optical depth @xmath11 , a coronal temperature @xmath12 , and a slab geometry allowed for a _ rough _ description of cyg  x-1 .",
    "although comptonization apparently accounts for the general behavior of the observed x - ray spectrum of cyg  x-1 , it appears that a reprocessing component is needed for the full description of the spectrum .",
    "formal descriptions of the different observations in terms of a reflection component with an underlying comptonization spectrum give better fits to the data than do pure comptonization models .",
    "the presence of a weak fluorescence line from neutral iron ( @xcite ) and the deviation of the 260-band from a pure power law seen by heao  1-a2 ( @xcite ) , which is usually interpreted as a compton reflection hump , both indicate the presence of cold or slightly ionized material present in the source , in addition to the comptonizing medium . therefore , since the radiation processes of comptonization and reprocessing of coronal radiation in the cold accretion disk cover a large range of photon energies ( @xmath13  to @xmath14 ) in the predicted x - ray spectrum , it is necessary to use - broad - band spectral observations to place meaningful constraints on the models .",
    "as we discussed in our companion paper ( dove , wilms , & begelman 1997 , hereafter paper  i ) , one serious drawback to solving the radiation transfer problem for an adc with analytic and `` linear '' monte carlo techniques ( where each photon particle is propagated through a fixed background ) is that the physical properties of the corona must be defined _ a priori_. the coronal properties and the radiation field are strongly coupled through the processes of compton cooling , compton upscattering , pair production and annihilation .",
    "therefore , it is not clear whether the _ assumed _ coronal properties are self - consistent with the resulting radiation field .",
    "we have recently developed an adc model in which the radiation field , the temperature and opacity of the corona , and the reprocessing of coronal radiation in the accretion disk are calculated self - consistently ( paper  i ) .",
    "we find that all previous adc models having a slab geometry and used to describe the x - ray spectrum of cyg  x-1 are not self - consistent , since the coronal temperatures and opacities are not within the physically allowed range of combinations of these parameters ( see fig .  2 of paper  i ) .",
    "@xcite claim that their `` best - fit '' model , having a coronal temperature @xmath15  and an optical depth @xmath16 , agree within the 3@xmath17 confidence level of their allowed @xmath18 relation .",
    "however , due to the quality of the data , the 3@xmath17 contour covers a very large region of the @xmath19 parameter space , of which only a very small part is within the self - consistently allowed region .    in this paper",
    ", we apply our self - consistent model to cyg  x-1 , using a more complete composite spectrum than was available to previous work ( @xcite ) .",
    "we study two geometries : ( 1 ) the standard slab geometry and ( 2 ) a spherical corona with an exterior accretion disk . at the time of writing ,",
    "simultaneous x - ray spectra covering the range from 2  to 250  were not generally available .",
    "we therefore had to use a non - simultaneous composite spectrum from several instruments to cover this energy range ( each observation was taken while cyg  x-1 was in its `` low '' state ) .",
    "a detailed description of the individual data comprising the composite spectrum and a preliminary analysis are given in @xcite.% ( instead of @xmath20% ) of the coronal radiation to be reprocessed into thermal radiation and leading to a corresponding erroneous compton cooling rate .",
    "as discussed in paper  i , the current version of our code has been successfully compared to other reprocessing models ( e.g. , @xcite ) . ]",
    "it appears impossible to produce an analytical model of an adc that properly accounts for the self - consistent thermal and opacity distributions of the corona while solving correctly the radiative transfer problem of an angle - dependent , high - energy radiation field in a semi - relativistic , non - uniform plasma ( including reprocessing of radiation in the accretion disk ) .",
    "therefore , numerical methods are needed . for the computations presented here",
    ", we use a non - linear monte carlo ( nlmc ) code to calculate self - consistently the temperature and opacity of the corona as well as the radiation field within and external to the corona .",
    "for the two geometries considered here , compton scattering , photon - photon pair production , and pair annihilations are taken into account within the corona .",
    "for the reprocessing of radiation within the accretion disk , compton scattering and photo - absorption , resulting in fluorescent line emission and thermal emission , are considered .",
    "we enforce charge neutrality by requiring @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are the number densities of electrons , positrons , and protons , respectively . for this paper , the spatial distribution of the seed opacity ( the opacity not including the contribution due to electron - positron pairs )",
    "was assumed to be uniform .",
    "the free parameters of our models are : ( 1 ) the seed opacity of the corona , @xmath25 , ( 2 ) the temperature of the accretion disk as a function of radius , @xmath26@xmath27 , and ( 3 ) the compactness parameter of the corona , @xmath28 . for a set of free parameters",
    ", the nlmc code is iterated until the temperature of the corona , @xmath29 , the total opacity , @xmath30 , and the radiation field have reached a steady state .",
    "thermal equilibrium is achieved when the _ local _ heating rate is balanced by the compton cooling rate .",
    "the pair opacity is determined by requiring pair - annihilations to balance pair - production .",
    "once the system has reached steady state , the spectra of escaping radiation are recorded ( in 10 bins of different inclination angles ) until satisfactory statistics are obtained .",
    "a detailed description of the nlmc code and its use for adc is given in paper  i.",
    "the most common geometry used to model the spectra of bhcs is the slab ( plane - parallel ) geometry . for this geometry , we assume that the accretion disk corona is situated above and below an optically thick , geometrically thin , cold accretion disk , that all corona and disk properties are constant with respect to radius , and that azimuthal symmetry applies . the coronal compactness parameter is defined to be @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the scale - height of the corona , @xmath33 is the luminosity of the corona , @xmath34  is the radius of the corona , @xmath35 is the eddington luminosity , @xmath36 is the schwarzschild radius , @xmath37 is the rate of energy dissipation per unit area into the corona and @xmath38 .",
    "the specification of the physical mechanism heating the corona is not necessary .",
    "we simply assume that the energy is dissipated uniformly with respect to height . for a specific value of @xmath28",
    ", the self - consistent coronal properties are degenerate with respect to @xmath32 and @xmath37 ( @xcite ) .    as we discuss below",
    ", the predicted amount of thermal excess in the escaping spectrum of radiation strongly depends on the temperature of the accretion disk , @xmath26 . a lower limit to the temperature",
    "can be estimated by assuming that the disk is heated solely by illumination from the corona . in this case , the temperature is approximated by balancing absorption with thermal emission : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the flux of coronal radiation incident onto the accretion disk ( assumed here , by symmetry , to be equal to the flux of escaping radiation ) , @xmath41 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , and @xmath42 is the angle - averaged albedo of the disk . using equation  ( [ eq : lcslab ] ) ,",
    "the disk temperature can be expressed as @xmath43 we refer the reader to paper  i for a more detailed discussion of the slab geometry models .",
    "as discussed in paper  i , we find that the maximum self - consistent temperature of the corona is @xmath44  for total opacities @xmath45 , regardless of the compactness parameter @xmath28  and @xmath26 .",
    "once this maximum temperature , @xmath46 , is reached , higher heating rates result in a higher opacity due to pair production , causing more reprocessing of coronal radiation in the accretion disk .",
    "since most of the reprocessed radiation is emitted as thermal radiation , the higher amount of reprocessing gives rise to higher compton cooling rates .",
    "therefore , once pair - production becomes important , an increase in the heating rate results in a decrease in the temperature .",
    "fig .  2 of paper  i shows the allowed parameter space of self - consistent corona temperatures and opacities .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cygslab ] we show our by - eye `` best - fit '' of the predicted angle - averaged spectrum , modified by interstellar absorption , to the composite spectrum of cyg  x-1 .",
    "[ fig : cygslab ]    for the slab geometry , the modeled spectrum shown is the hardest spectrum possible while having a cut - off energy @xmath47 .",
    "it is apparent , however , that the predicted spectrum is still much softer than the observed spectrum . in our grid of models ,",
    "the range of seed opacities is @xmath48 and the range of coronal compactness parameters is @xmath49 ( see paper  i ) . out of the entire grid ,",
    "the hardest spectrum predicted by our self - consistent models has a photon index of @xmath50 , while cyg  x-1 has a power - law index of @xmath51 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the bbxrt archived data were deconvolved by assuming a power - law continuum , with a photon index of @xmath52 , absorbed by the interstellar medium with @xmath53 @xmath54 .",
    "the ttm data were reduced by borkous et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , the hexe data by @xcite , and the osse data by @xcite . since the models provided reasonable reduced chi - squared values ( @xmath55 )",
    ", the unfolded data should be at least a good approximation to the actual spectrum .",
    "therefore , even though we are comparing our predicted spectra with unfolded data , which are dependent on the assumed model , the result that the predicted spectrum is always softer than the observed spectrum is not sensitive to the deconvolution procedure .    according to our _ linear _ ( and therefore not self - consistent ) mc simulations , simulated spectra with @xmath56 , while @xmath57 , are achieved only for models with @xmath58 .",
    "these values are consistent with past work , in which the spectrum of cyg  x-1 has been described by adc models with a slab geometry ( @xcite ) . such models , however , are not self - consistent , for the temperature and opacity values lie within the forbidden region of fig .  2 of paper  i. we remind the reader that the predicted maximum temperatures are indeed upper limits , for our models do _ not _ include additional cooling mechanisms such as bremsstrahlung .",
    "( this mechanism was found to be negligible for the models of interest , but its inclusion would reduce the maximum temperatures allowed . )    in addition to the simulated spectra having too soft a power - law component , our models predict a very large fe  k@xmath0 equivalent width ( ew ) .",
    "our `` best - fit '' slab model predicts an @xmath59 , considerably larger than the observed value of @xmath60   ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the slab models also predict an excess of radiation for energies @xmath61  ( i.e. , a `` soft excess '' ) .",
    "since the `` best - fit '' slab models are optically thin , most of the thermal emission emitted by the disk escapes the system without interacting with the corona .",
    "we have accounted for galactic absorption by using the observed column density of hydrogen , @xmath62 @xmath54 ( @xcite ) . clearly , this is not sufficient to `` hide '' the soft excess for the 200  disk models .",
    "models with a higher value of @xmath63 predict too low of a flux for energies below @xmath64 , so this soft - excess problem can not be solved by having having arbitrarily large hydrogen column densities in the model .",
    "we note , however , that the bbxrt observation is unique since a soft - excess was not observed ( @xcite ) .",
    "since cyg  x-1 usually has a soft - excess component ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the discrepancy between the predicted flux and the observed flux at low energies should not be considered a serious problem by itself .",
    "however , it does appear that our `` best - fit '' slab geometry model predicts a higher soft - excess component than observed by the _ asca _",

    "_ we conclude that self - consistent accretion disk corona models with a slab geometry are not capable of reproducing the observed broad x - ray spectrum of cyg x-1 . _",
    "the main limitation of the slab geometry models , in regard to explaining the high - energy spectra of cyg  x-1 , is that there is too much reprocessing of coronal radiation in the cold accretion disk .",
    "therefore , models with the reprocessing matter having a smaller covering fraction ( as seen from the corona ) are more likely to explain the observations .",
    "one such geometry is a combination of a spherical corona with an optically thick , geometrically thin , cold accretion disk . here",
    ", the accretion disk is assumed to be exterior to the corona , as shown in fig .  [",

    "this geometry is very similar to the two - temperature accretion disk model of @xcite , although , in our model , the proton temperature is assumed to be equal to the electron temperature .",
    "this geometry is also similar to the advection - dominated disk models by narayan and collaborators ( @xcite ; @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "however , in our models , the seed photons for comptonization are produced by the accretion disk through thermal emission rather than bremsstrahlung and synchotron radiation within the corona .",
    "the accretion disk extends from @xmath34  to @xmath65 where @xmath34  is the radius of the sphere and @xmath65  is the outer radius of the disk .",

    "we set @xmath67 , but the main results are not sensitive to this value ( see   [ sec : sphresults ] ) .",
    "we define the coronal compactness parameter by @xmath68 similar to the slab geometry models , we allow for intrinsic emission of thermal radiation by the accretion disk ( in addition to emission due to the reprocessing of coronal radiation ) .",
    "we define @xmath69 to be the rate at which gravitational energy is dissipated directly into the corona , where @xmath70 is the _ total _ rate of gravitational energy dissipated into the system .",
    "consequently , @xmath71 is the rate of energy dissipation into the disk .",
    "the total luminosity of the accretion disk is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the rate at which energy is absorbed ( not reflected ) by the disk due to the reprocessing of radiation emitted by the corona .",

    "as in the slab - geometry model , we can estimate a lower limit to the disk temperature by assuming that the disk is heated solely by illumination from the corona ; @xmath83 where @xmath84  is the total luminosity leaving the corona and @xmath85is the fraction of photons leaving the corona that is reprocessed in the disk .",
    "this fraction can be approximated by assuming that the photons leaving the corona are uniformly distributed over the surface of the corona with an isotropic distribution . with these assumptions ,",

    "[ fig : fdisk ] , we show how the covering fraction depends on @xmath91 .    it is apparent that @xmath92 is nearly constant for @xmath93 , and therefore the amount of reprocessing of radiation within the accretion disk is insensitive to @xmath91 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath94  is @xmath95 .",
    "in contrast , for a slab geometry , all of the downward directed radiation at the base of the corona interacts with the accretion disk . therefore , the slab geometry models predict much more prominent reprocessing features in the spectrum of escaping radiation .    for large accretion disks ( i.e. , @xmath96 ) , the local disk temperature can vary by more than an order of magnitude between the inner and outer radius . rather than using an average disk temperature for calculating the spectrum emitted by the disk ,",
    "a more proper treatment is to take into account the temperature structure .",
    "we can estimate the disk temperature as a function of radius by equating the flux of absorbed coronal radiation with thermal emission , @xmath97 where @xmath98 , @xmath99 is the differential covering fraction of a ring of radius @xmath100 , and @xmath101 is determined numerically using equation  ( [ eq : fdisk ] ) . using equation  ( [ eq : lcsphere ] ) ,",

    "it should be remembered , however , that if any accretion - energy were dissipated directly into the accretion disk ( @xmath106 ) , then the disk temperature would be higher than the values given above . to address this possibility , we consider a simple model where , for @xmath107 , the accretion disk behaves as the standard @xmath0 disk ( @xcite ) , while , for @xmath108 , all of the accretion energy is dissipated into the corona . in order to determine the relative importance of the internal dissipation of energy , compared to the contribution from coronal illumination , we estimate the disk temperature by neglecting the contribution from illumination . in addition",
    ", we make the simplifying assumption that the disk is optically thick and radiates as a blackbody such that the emitted flux is equal to the dissipation rate , @xmath109 where we have assumed @xmath110 ( frank , king , & raine , 1992 ) . defining @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the efficiency by which the accretion process converts gravitational energy into radiation , and using the standard definition of the eddington luminosity , @xmath35",
    ", we can express the disk temperature as @xmath113 by comparing equation  ( [ eq : talpha ] ) with equation  ( [ eq : tbbr ] ) ( or fig .",
    "[ fig : tbbr ] ) , it appears that the heating rate due to the direct dissipation of accretion energy is comparable to that from coronal illumination .",
    "a proper treatment of the disk temperature structure would be to equate thermal emission with both heating mechanisms .",
    "such a treatment is outside the scope of this paper ; with a heating rate equal to twice the value used in equation  ( [ eq : talpha ] ) , the disk temperature will be roughly @xmath114 times higher than the value given in equation  ( [ eq : talpha ] ) ( @xmath115 is proportional to the total heating rate per unit area ) .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of direct energy dissipation into the disk changes the disk s total luminosity , but does not significantly change the temperature profile of the disk .    for simplicity , we have assumed that the intrinsic flux of thermal radiation is constant with respect to radius ( the emission due to reprocessing , however , is determined locally by equating emission with absorption ) .",
    "this approximation is not too important since the emission due to reprocessing is higher than the emission due to internal dissipation for the models considered in this paper . in regards to the soft excess issue , for @xmath116 , these models slightly overestimate the predicted amount of soft excess by less than 10% .      in all of our models ,",
    "the seed - photons are produced within the cold accretion disk ( we neglect bremsstrahlung radiation ) .",

    "all previous adc models that have successfully described the spectra of cyg  x-1 have temperature and opacity values that are outside the allowed region of self - consistent values . in addition , as discussed in paper  i , the predicted angle - averaged equivalent width ( ew ) of the fe k  @xmath0 fluorescent line is @xmath158 , a value roughly three times higher than the measured value for cyg  x-1 ( @xcite ) , indicating that the covering fraction of the reprocessing material is @xmath159 .",
    "_ we believe that there is no way around these shortcomings of the slab geometry model and that these adc models are not the appropriate models for explaining the high - energy spectra of bhcs .",
    "_ this claim is in agreement with @xcite , who , by fitting the joint _ ginga_-osse observation of cyg  x-1 with a power law plus a reflection component , find that the solid angle of the cold medium is @xmath160 , significantly lower than the angle corresponding to the slab geometry , a result consistent with @xcite .",
    "@xcite also argue that the corona must be `` soft - photon starved , '' which rules out a slab geometry .    for adc models with a sphere@xmath3disk geometry ,",
    "there are self - consistent temperature and opacity combinations such that the power - law and cut - off portions of the spectra of bhcs can be explained .",
    "in addition , due to the small covering fraction of the disk as seen from the corona , it is possible that the `` effective '' disk temperature ( a flux - weighted average disk temperature ) can be as low as @xmath161 . with such low values ,",
    "the models predict a thermal excess ( or lack thereof ) that appears to be consistent with the observations of cyg  x-1 since galactic absorption is more efficient at these lower energies .",
    "it is still unclear , however , whether an adc model having this geometry is stable , as the @xcite model suffers from a thermal instability ( @xcite ) . in our models",
    ", we can only assume a corona / disk morphology , but we can not determine whether this morphology is thermally or dynamically stable .",
    "the sphere@xmath3disk geometry does approximate the geometry corresponding to the advection - dominated models of ( @xcite , and references therein ) which appear to be thermally stable .",
    "in addition , our best - fit models for cyg  x-1 have an optical depth @xmath5 and a coronal temperature @xmath162 , values that are consistent with the advection - dominated models if the mass accretion rate @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is the eddington accretion rate ( @xcite ) .    the results obtained here for cyg  x-1 are also applicable to other low state bhcs . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bhcs ] we compare the spectra of the black hole x - ray transients gs2023 + 338 and gro j0422 + 32 to the predicted spectra from our sphere+disk geometry model .",
    "occasionally black hole x - ray transients have spectra that are dominated by a strong soft - excess at lower energies and a pure power - law component at high energies . in the low state , however , gs2023 + 338 ( = v404 cyg ) and gro j0422 + 32 did not contain a soft excess , and their spectra of are very similar to that of the low - state of cyg  x-1 .",
    "therefore , it appears that photon starved adc models , such as the sphere@xmath3disk geometry , are applicable in explaining the observed x - ray spectra of many bhcs .",
    "our `` fits '' to the unfolded data should be interpreted as a motivation to consider this model in much more detail .",
    "for example , we have recently implemented our sphere+disk model in tabular form for the xspec user - defined model .",
    "we have recently implemented the sphere+disk geometry spectral grid as an user - defined model for xspec ( version 9 , @xcite ) , and are currently analyzing new data of cyg  x-1 and other bhcs from the rxte satellite .",
    "our preliminary results are in agreement with the results presented in this paper .",
    "we thank m.  nowak for the many useful discussions .",
    "we also thank k.  ebisawa , the referee , for his useful suggestions which improved the clarity of this paper .",
    "this work has been financed by nsf grants ast91 - 20599 , ast95 - 29175 , int95 - 13899 , and nasa grant nag5 - 2026 ( gro guest investigator program ) , dara grant 50 or 92054 , and by a travel grant to j.w .  and m.g.m .  from the daad .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained through the heasarc online service , provided by nasa - gsfc , and of data obtained through the iue vilspa data server , operated by the european space agency .",
    "comparisons of our models with observations have relied on the photon - spectrum presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : cygsphb ] .",
    "although the use of `` unfolded '' x - ray spectra is very common in the astronomical literature , it is important to keep in mind how these spectra are prepared . due to the poor energy resolution of today s x - ray detectors ,",
    "the inversion of the detector response - matrix is generally impossible ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "thus , in order to get an estimate of the intrinsic photon spectrum from a source , a spectral model has to be fit to the spectrum observed by the x - ray detector , usually using a @xmath165-reduction method and an estimate for the detector response matrix ( gorenstein , gursky , & garmire , 1968 ) .",
    "if the @xmath165-value resulting from the fitting process is small , then it is assumed that the modeled photon - spectrum is a good representation of the observed photon - spectrum . in order to produce an `` unfolded '' spectrum , the additional assumption is made that the residual ( for a given detector energy channel ) between the modeled spectrum ( folded through the response matrix ) and the observed count - rate is a good representation of the deviation between the spectral model and the intrinsic photon - spectrum ( in energy space ) .",
    "thus , at a given energy , the product of the modeled photon - flux and the ratio between the observed count - rate and the ( estimated ) model count - rate is what is called the `` unfolded '' spectrum .",
    "although a small @xmath165-value of the fit to the `` unfolded '' spectrum usually implies that the model is an adequate description of the intrinsic spectrum , sometimes this is not true .",
    "fitting our models to the observed data in detector - space ( using the method described above ) would , in principle , give the best method of determining the `` goodness of fit . ''",
    "however , the cpu time needed to obtain model spectra with a signal to noise ratio that is suitable for spectral fitting is prohibitively high , and we were forced to use a simplified approach ; for a particular detector , we simulated an observation using our modeled spectrum as the intrinsic spectrum , the correct detector response matrix , background estimate , and observational poisson noise .",
    "this simulated spectrum was then fit with several spectral models that are typically used to describe the x - ray spectra of bhcs ( e.g. , a power - law with an exponential cutoff ) .",
    "we performed these tests using several typical x - ray detectors ( rosat , xte - pca , hexe ) and using typical count - rates and observation times for these detectors . in all of the tests the fit - parameters found using our model spectrum were in agreement with typical fit - parameters found in the real observation of cyg  x-1 . in the simulated xte - pca observation ,",
    "e.g. , the model spectrum below 30  can be roughly described by an absorbed power - law with an index of @xmath166 .",
    "this index is similar to those found , e.g. , by @xcite and @xcite . in the residuals of the simulation the fe line and the reflection hump",
    "are clearly visible .",
    "using a more appropriate model that incorporates reflection , the simulated spectrum is best described by reflection of a power - law of index @xmath167 off a cold accretion disk with covering factor 0.4 . using an assumed length of 5ksec for the rosat - pspc observation it is possible to see evidence for the soft - excess in the simulated observation . according to this simulated observation , the soft - excess as seen by rosat pspc can be described by a black - body with a temperature of about 100ev or less , which is roughly comparable with the observations by @xcite .",
    "therefore , we are confident that the model - spectrum of fig .  [",
    "fig : cygsphb ] is a good representation of the intrinsic photon - spectrum of cyg  x-1 ."
