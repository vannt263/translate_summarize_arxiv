    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is established as the theory of the strong nuclear force but the degrees of freedom observed in nature , hadrons and nuclei , are different from those appearing in the qcd lagrangian , quarks and gluons .",

    "nuclei are effectively and well described as clusters of protons and neutrons held together by a strong , long - range force mediated by meson exchange @xcite . whether the nucleon changes",
    "its internal structure while embedded into a nuclear medium has been a long - standing question in nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "the nuclear european muon collaboration ( emc ) effect seems to suggest the modification of hadrons in the nuclear medium ; see @xcite .",
    "the issue has attracted theoretical attention and various models have been developed to study medium modifications .",
    "a list of some of these models includes the many - body soliton dynamics model by celenza _",

    "_ @xcite have studied incoherent deeply virtual compton scattering on @xmath0he in the @xmath7 reaction , which probes medium - modifications of the bound nucleon gpds and elastic form factors .",
    "medium modifications of nucleon properties in nuclear matter and finite nuclei have been also discussed by wen and shen @xcite .",
    "the question has also attracted experimental attention .",
    "one of the most intuitive methods to investigate the properties of nucleons inside nuclei is quasi - elastic scattering off nuclei .",
    "since the charge and magnetic responses of a single nucleon are quite well studied from elastic scattering experiments , measuring the same response from quasi - elastic scattering off nuclei and comparing with a single nucleon is likely to shed light on the question .",
    "the ratio of polarization - transfer coefficients in elastic @xmath8 scattering , @xmath9 , is directly proportional to the ratio of the electric and magnetic form factors of the proton , @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11 here @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the polarization - transfer coefficients transverse and longitudinal to the momentum - transfer direction , @xmath14 and @xmath15^{-1}$ ] and @xmath16 are kinematic variables , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the incident and final electron energies , @xmath19 is the electron scattering angle , @xmath20 is the nucleon mass , and @xmath3 is the four - momentum transfer squared .",
    "when such measurements are performed on a nuclear target in quasi - elastic kinematics , the polarization - transfer observables are sensitive to the form - factor ratio of the proton embedded in the nuclear medium . however",
    ", distinguishing possible changes in the structure of nucleons embedded in a nucleus from more conventional many - body effects like meson - exchange currents ( mec ) , isobar configurations ( ic ) or final - state interactions ( fsi ) is only possible within the context of a model .",
    "experimental results for the polarization - transfer ratio are conveniently expressed in terms of the polarization double ratio , @xmath21 in order to emphasize differences between the in - medium compared to the free values . here",
    ", the polarization - transfer ratio for the quasi - elastic proton knockout reaction , @xmath22 , is normalized to the polarization - transfer ratio measured off hydrogen in the identical setting .",
    "such a double ratio cancels nearly all experimental systematic uncertainties .",
    "experiment e89 - 033 was the first to measure the polarization transfer @xmath23 in a complex nucleus , @xmath24o @xcite .",
    "the results are consistent with predictions of relativistic calculations based on the free proton from factor within a rather large experimental uncertainty of about 18% .",
    "polarization - transfer experiments have studied nuclear medium effects in deuterium @xcite at the mainz microtron ( mami ) and mit - bates and more recently at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jlab ) @xcite . within statistical uncertainties ,",
    "no evidence of medium modifications was found and the data are well described by a model calculation of arenhvel , which includes final - state interactions ( fsi ) , meson - exchange currents ( mec ) , and isobar configurations , as well as relativistic contributions ; see @xcite . as the sampled density is small ,",
    "it is not surprising that there are no indications for medium modifications of the proton electromagnetic form factors in the @xmath5h data .",
    "one might expect to find larger medium effects in @xmath0he , with its significantly higher density .",
    "indeed , a recent jlab experiment has made a precision measurement of the emc effect in both few - body nuclei and heavy nuclei .",
    "the findings indicate that the nuclear dependence of the deep - inelastic cross section for @xmath0he is comparable to that for @xmath25c @xcite .",
    "although estimates of the many - body effects in @xmath0he may be more difficult than in @xmath5h , calculations for @xmath0he indicate they are small @xcite .",
    "the first @xmath0he@xmath26h polarization - transfer measurements were performed at mami at @xmath27 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath5 @xcite and at jefferson lab hall a at @xmath3 = 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.6 , and 2.6 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "our recent experiment e03 - 104 @xcite extended these measurements with two high - precision points at @xmath3 = 0.8 and 1.3 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath5 .",
    "all these data were taken in quasi - elastic kinematics at low missing momentum with symmetry about the three - momentum - transfer direction to minimize conventional many - body effects in the reaction . e03 - 104 covers a range of missing momenta up to about 135 mev/@xmath4 . in these experiments ,",
    "two high - resolution spectrometers were used to detect the scattered electron and the recoil proton in coincidence .",
    "the missing - mass technique was used to identify @xmath2h in the final state .",
    "the proton spectrometer was equipped with a focal plane polarimeter ( fpp ) .",
    "polarized protons lead to azimuthal asymmetries after scattering in the carbon analyzer of the fpp .",
    "these distributions , in combination with information on the spin precession of the proton in the magnetic fields of the spectrometer , the carbon analyzing power , and the beam helicity , were analyzed by means of a maximum likelihood method to obtain the induced polarization , @xmath28 , and polarization transfer components , @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite . as the experiment was designed to detect differences between the in - medium polarizations and the free values , both @xmath0he and @xmath29h targets were employed .    in the polarization - transfer double ratio @xmath30 ,",
    "nearly all systematic uncertainties cancel : the polarization - transfer observables are not sensitive , to first order , to the instrumental asymmetries in the fpp , and their ratio is independent of the electron beam polarization and the graphite analyzing power .",
    "the small systematic uncertainties are due , mainly , to the uncertainties in the spin transport through the proton spectrometer but an extensive study is being performed in order to reduce their contribution to the total uncertainty .",
    "the induced proton polarization @xmath31 is a direct measure of final - state interactions .",
    "however , the @xmath31 extraction is greatly complicated by the presence of instrumental asymmetries in the fpp .",
    "typically , instrumental asymmetries are due to detector misalignments , detector inefficiencies or tracking issues .",
    "an ongoing effort aimed at devising a method to minimize instrumental asymmetries will make possible the precise extraction of the induced polarization @xmath31 from e03 - 104 measurements .",
    "the preliminary @xmath0he@xmath32h polarization - transfer observables @xmath12 and @xmath13 and their ratios @xmath9 are shown in figure [ fig : pxpzr ] for various missing momentum bins and at @xmath33 of 0.8 ( left panel ) and 1.3 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath34 ( right panel ) .",
    "the data are normalized by the experimental results from elastic @xmath29h@xmath35 scattering .",
    "these ratios show most clearly the difference between quasi - elastic and elastic results .",
    "an experimental advantage of these ratios is additionally the cancellation of the carbon analyzing power .",
    "the data show that the @xmath0he results are systematically low compared to the @xmath29h results for @xmath12 and high for @xmath13 resulting in an about 10% to 12% quenching of the polarization - transfer ratio @xmath9 .",
    "the amount of quenching in the data appears to increase with missing momentum .",
    "the data are compared with model calculations by the madrid group @xcite based on a relativistic plane - wave impulse approximation ( rpwia ) , a relativistic distorted - wave impulse approximation ( rdwia ) , and the rdwia including medium - modified nucleon form factors from the qmc model @xcite ( rdwia+qmc ) .",
    "results of these calculations are shown in figure [ fig : pxpzr ] as light , medium , and dark bands , respectively .",
    "the widths of the bands indicate the variation in the results of the calculations using various input : the @xmath36 or @xmath37 current operators as defined in @xcite and the relativistic optical potentials by mcneil , ray , and wallace@xcite ( mrw ) or horowitz @xcite ( rlf ) to model fsi .",
    "all these calculations use the coulomb gauge .",
    "mec are not explicitly included in the madrid calculation .",
    "predictions by meucci _",
    "@xcite show that the two - body current ( the seagull diagram ) effects are generally small ( less than 3 % close to zero missing momenta ) and visible only at high missing momenta .",
    "the sets of calculations give distinctively different results even with these changes in the model input and the small uncertainties from e03 - 104 allow to discriminate between the various sets of calculations .",
    "both , rpwia and rdwia calculations do not describe the data ; this is most noticeable in the polarization - transfer double ratio , @xmath30 , where rdwia accounts for only about half of the observed quenching .",
    "the data favor the inclusion of the density - dependent in - medium form factors from the qmc model into the rdwia calculations in all cases .",
    "the inclusion of the in - medium form factors leads to a relative reduction of @xmath12 and a relative increase of @xmath13 compared to the rdwia results with a resulting effect of lowering the polarization - transfer ratio by an additional 5% to 6% and bringing it into agreement with data .",
    "it is interesting to note that main differences in the results of the rdwia and rdwia+qmc calculations can be quantitatively understood by naively applying the elastic @xmath8 scattering formalism to the quasielastic case . from eq .",

    "( [ eq : px ] ) and ( [ eq : pz ] ) we can then estimate the changes of the individual polarization - transfer coefficients due to a variation of @xmath10 ; these depend on the kinematics of the experiment , @xmath38 . with a decrease of @xmath9 by about 5%",
    "this leads for the particular kinematics of our experiment at @xmath3 of 0.8 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath5 to a relative decrease of @xmath12 by about 2% and to a relative increase of @xmath13 by about 3% .",
