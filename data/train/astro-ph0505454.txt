    "thick accretion discs may appear in systems containing compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars .",
    "these could form in different scenarios governed by gravitational forces .",
    "specific examples are : ( i ) gravitational collapse of a rotating massive star , ( ii ) the coalescence of two compact objects or ( iii ) accretion phenomena asociated with low mass x  ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .    the first case ( gravitational collapse ) ,",
    "may be related to the production of @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) as in the collapsar or hypernova models .",
    "the collapsar ( or failed supernova ) was proposed by @xcite and offers the possibility to form a thick disc when the mantle of a rotating massive star ( @xmath1 ) falls freely onto the recently formed black hole .",
    "the material has a very high angular momentum , which prevents it from directly accreting and a centrifugally supported disc is formed .",
    "these systems are related to energetic , long duration ( @xmath2 s ) grbs accompanied by a type ib@xmath3ic supernova @xcite .",
    "similar numerical relativistic calculations concerning the collapse of massive stars , reported by @xcite and @xcite may explain the formation of massive black holes surounded by a debris torus .",
    "the hypernova scenario was proposed by @xcite and is also related to grbs .",
    "hypernov   are extremely energetic supernova explosions ( _ kinetic energy _ @xmath4 erg ) , which consider ( a ) a single star ( i.e. wolf  rayet type star ) or ( b ) a binary system formed by massive stars ( @xmath5 ) orbiting closely ( @xmath6 ) around each other , and which eventually merge to form a single star [ see @xcite for a comprehensive review ] .",
    "this star will undergo gravitational collapse , leading to the formation of a compact object . due to the rapid rotation , a thick accretion disc around the remaining black hole will be formed . in either case , a hot , thick disc of @xmath7 is expected around the newborn black hole .",
    "another posibility to form thick discs is via the coalescence of two compact objects , leading to the formation of a system composed of a black hole and an accretion torus .",
    "this has been investigated by various groups using nummerical simulations .",
    "some of the first results were obtained by @xcite , who modeled the merger of two neutron stars .",
    "they showed that after few orbital periods the residual material could form a thick disc .",
    "these results have been confirmed and extended ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the merger of two neutron stars , where again , a hot thick disc is formed around a central mass , which will presumably collapse to a black hole .",
    "investigating the more complex fusion of a neutron star and a black hole , @xcite and @xcite found that after the initial mass transfer there is a remnant of material around the black hole ( see also recent results by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "all these scenarios may form massive ( @xmath8 ) and dense discs .",
    "there are also low  mass discs ( @xmath9 1 ) which are formed through mass transfer in a binary system .",
    "a steady supply of mass , energy and angular momentum produces structures which are nearly in a steady state , but which nevertheless exhibit variability on various timescales ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "+ once the disc is formed , one may ask :   under which conditions is it dynamically stable or unstable ( quite apart from the question of thermal stability , if dynamically stable ) ? answering this in any detail requires the consideration of viscosity , self  gravity , magnetic fields and the angular momentum distribution of the material within the disc .",
    "this last point led @xcite to investigate the stability of an isentropic and constant angular momentum disc , and find that it is unstable to global non ",
    "axisymetric perturbations .",
    "dimensional calculations by  @xcite found that there is indeed a redistribution of angular momentum within the disc , due to the growth of non - axisymetric instabilities . in the presence of accretion , however , this instability may be suppressed @xcite , and thick tori with relatively flat distributions of angular momentum may actually occur in astrophysical systems .",
    "perhaps one of the most interesting global instabilities is the so  called runaway radial instability , which was identified by @xcite .",
    "it is due to a violent mass exchange asociated with the rapidly changing equipotential roche surfaces of the disc + black hole system .",
    "it is catastrophic and leads to the complete destruction of the disc on a dynamical time scale .",
    "it is well known that in binary systems there is a point called the interior lagrangian point @xmath10 , located at a radius @xmath11 where there is a balance between gravitational and centrifugal forces . for accreting discs ,",
    "when mass transfer from the disc to the central object begins the corresponding lagrange point , lying between the compact object and the disc , moves outward .",
    "the accretion rate increases rapidly until the disc is accreted completely .",
    "@xcite found that the rotation of the black hole inhibits the runaway radial instability and later @xcite confirmed this result and reported that the self - gravity of the disc has a destabilizing effect .",
    "it appears that the most critical parameter in the runaway radial instability is the specific angular momentum distribution within the disc . in the last twenty five years",
    "there has been much work on this issue from _ stationary _",
    "( i.e. schwarzschild metric ) to _ dynamical _",
    "( i.e. kerr metric ) space  time models .",
    "a complete summary of the work done appears in the extensive work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors conclude , as @xcite did earlier , that the instability is suppresed when the angular momentum follows a power law distribution with a positive radial gradient . in this",
    "respect studies made by @xcite and @xcite concerning compact binary mergers show that the distribution of angular momentum in post  merger discs is far from being constant , and thus they are stable in this context .",
    "+ our numerical simulations were performed in order to address two questions : ( i ) how do thick discs oscillate ? and ( ii ) how does a localized perturbation affect the global oscillatory behaviour of the disc ?",
    "these are formulated in the particular context in the millisecond oscillations discovered in x  ray binary sources by _ rxte _ @xcite .",
    "these systems have compact objects surrounded by an accretion disc , whose variability could be imprinted on the x  ray lightcurve and corresponding power spectra .",
    "disc oscillations have been investigated numerically and analytically by several groups before , and may be applied to the quasi periodical oscillations ( qpos ) observed in many x  ray sources @xcite .",
    "one specific model @xcite accounts for the high frequency qpos as a result of p  mode oscillations of an accretion torus orbiting close to the black hole .",
    "@xcite investigated theoretically how a relativistic torus oscillates in a stationary schwarzschild space  time , showing that the eigenfrequencies of the axisymmetric oscillations correspond to acoustic p  modes .",
    "their results shows that the oscillations behaves like a sound wave globally traped within the disc , with the eigenfrequencies appearing in the sequence 2:3:4 ... independently of the distribution of angular momentum considered .",
    "the same conclusions are obtained by @xcite using numerical simulations for a dynamical kerr space  time , concluding that p ",

    "mentioned above , @xcite noted in gro j165540 , that the two stable peaks that appear in the power spectrum in the hhz range are in a 3:2 ratio .",

    "this behaviour may also be present in a system containing a neutron star ( sco x1 ) @xcite , and could be explained by parametric resonance in a thin disc @xcite .",
    "these models predict that the frequencies will show the epicyclic motions of a perturbed flow line in the accretion disc or a combination of these and a fixed perturbation associated to the spin of the central object ( in the neutron star sources ) .",

    "we show that there is a shifting to lower frequencies as the thickness of the disc is increased , independently of the distribution of angular momentum within the torus .",
    "we also show that it is possible to excite internal p  modes in a thick accretion disc , by means of a localized perturbation which affects only a small portion of the disc periodically , exciting the strongest modes apparent in a 3:2 frequency ratio .",
    "we empasize that the results presented here are purely dynamical in a pseudo  newtonian gravitational potential which mimics the properties of the schwarzschild metric for a stationary space  time .",

    "our initial conditions are generated by fixing the mass of the central object , the equation of state , with @xmath74 and the constant @xmath75 , the filling factor for the potential , @xmath30 and the distribution of angular momentum @xmath26 .",

    "having identified the strongest response in the radial oscillations as a modified epicyclic frequency , or p  mode , we proceeded to apply localized , periodic perturbations to thick tori ( as in paper  i ) .",
    "we believe it is reasonable to assume that the perturbation will be stronger in the inner regions of the disc , if it arises from the central object , and periodic , if it is related to its spin period ( clearly identifiable in neutron star systems ) or some other mechanism repeating at intervals @xmath98 .",
    "this perturbation can be related to a wide variety of phenomena coming from the central object or from the material that conforms the disc .",
    "a specific example could be the emission of gravitational radiation from the black hole when a clump of material is accreted and breaks the axial symmetry in a cuasi  periodic fashion .",
    "this could produce a time variation in the mass quadrupole of the disc itself @xcite .",
    "another possibility in this context was proposed by @xcite , and is related to the connection between the magnetic field of the disc and the gravitational radiation produced by the black hole .",
    "disc oscillations can be related to the formation of the disc , or to its intrinsic properties .",
    "simulations by @xcite have shown that variablity and oscillations can be triggerred by viscous processes .",
    "@xcite has suggested that energy flux within the disc through viscous and angular momentum processes can alter the equilibrium state , producing oscillations . finally , in highly dynamical situations",
    ", the disc will naturally lack complete azimuthal symmetry ( e.g. , in compact object mergers ) and the formation of clumps inside the disc could lead to small oscillations .",
    "we have modeled perturbations in the context of non - constant angular momentum discs in the same way that we did in paper  i , introducing an additional acceleration in the equations of motion , given by : @xmath99 here @xmath100 is the acceleration due to gravity , @xmath101 is the outer edge of the torus and @xmath80 is a parameter that modulates the strength of the perturbation .",
    "the exponential term decays on a scale @xmath102 , the radial extension of the disc , thus reproducing the desired behaviour for the perturbative force , which will be strong near the inner radius and weak in the outer regions .",
    "this acceleration induces radial oscillations , which can be fourier analyzed to extract the main frequencies in a similar fashion as was done by @xcite .",
    "we performed simulations using constant and non  constant angular momentum distributions within the disc .",
    "for the constant distribution , we find , as described in paper  i for a few particular cases , that the localized perturbation induces global oscillations at various characteristic frequencies .",
    "the most prominent ( besides that ocurring at the perturbing frequency @xmath103 ) is at @xmath104 , the modified epicyclic frequency associated with the radial motions of the centre of the disc .",
    "a second broad peak with about ten times less power at @xmath105 is in a 3:2 relation with the former ( see figure  7 ) .",
    "this latter feature is barely made out in the calculations where an impulsive perturbation was applied to the whole disc at @xmath106 .    for a power law distribution of angular momentum",
    "we find that the disc responds somewhat differently to the localized perturbation .",
    "a typical power spectrum for the radial motions of the centre of the disc is shown in figure  8 ( when @xmath107  hz ) .",
    "two strong narrow peaks are evident at @xmath103 and @xmath108 , despite the fact that the perturbation is a pure sinusoid .",
    "furthermore , a weak subharmonic at @xmath109 is also present .",
    "this is clear evidence of non  linear coupling between various modes , and is reminiscent of analogous results for forced oscillations in slender tori previously reported in the context of khz qpos in lmxbs @xcite .",
    "note that the overtone is absent in the power spectrum in figure  7 ( when the angular momentum is constant in the disc ) .",
    "as for the case with constant angular momentum , two more peaks , at @xmath110  hz , and @xmath111 can be seen in the spectrum . to the limit of our resolution , they are in a 3:2 correspondence .",
    "thus it appears that the angular momentum distribution is somehow responsible for a certain mode coupling which allows higher harmonics and subharmonics of the perturbation to appear in the power spectrum .",
    "note also that when an impulsive perturbation was used in a thick torus with a power law distribution of angular momentum , secondary features , consistent with being in a 3:2 relation with the stronger ones , are apparent in the spectrum once the torus becomes relatively thick(see figure  6 , middle and bottom right panels ) .",
    "apparently the periodic nature of the forcing also has a direct influence on the magnitude of the response of the system .",

    "we have performed a numerical study of the global oscillations of geometrically thick fluid tori in axisymmetry .",
    "we have neglected self  gravity , but used a pseudo  potential to mimic the effects of strong gravity for the potential produced by the central mass . after building initial conditions in hydrostatic equilibrium with a prescribed rotation law ( given through the distribution of specific angular momentum within the disc ) ,",
    "global impulsive and localized periodic perturbations have been applied , and the disc s response has been measured through the time variation of certain quantities , and their corresponding fourier transforms . an ideal gas equation of state has been used throughout .    as the size of the torus",
    "is increased by filling up the effective potential well to a greater degree ( see figures  1 , 5 and 6 ) , we find , by applying impulsive kicks , that the fundamental global mode of radial oscillations monotonically decreases from the analytic expression for the local radial epicyclic frequency at the position of the centre of the torus .",
    "this effect is present independently of the assumed distribution of angular momentum ( be it a constant or a power law ) .",
    "that is , a slender torus tends to oscillate as a free particle would , and a thicker one does so at lower frequencies .",
    "this effect is simply due to the increased size of the resonant cavity , and the density stratification within it which affects the propagation of sound waves .",
    "it was found analytically in calculations performed in the schwarzschild metric with height  integrated tori for inertial  acoustic modes ( p  modes ) recently @xcite , and we confirm it here for the more general case of a full torus perturbed slightly from equilibrium .    upon application of a localized and periodic external perturbation , however , the torus responds in a manner which does depend on the distribution of angular momentum .",
    "as previously reported in the context of lmxbs ( paper  i ) , for @xmath117=cst the fundamental radial mode at frequency @xmath96 and the first overtone at @xmath118 are excited ( although the overtone is noticeably weaker than the fundamental )",
    ".    for a power law distribution of angular momentum ( specifically we used @xmath119 ) , the fundamental at @xmath96 was always present , as was the first overtone at @xmath120 .",
    "furthermore , a harmonic of the perturbation itself , at @xmath108 , and a subharmonic at @xmath109 always appeared .",
    "we take this latter fact to indicate the presence of non  linear mode coupling , since the applied perturbation was purely sinusoidal and contained only a single frequency .",
    "trial calculations in both cases revealed that varying the perturbation frequency @xmath103 by a factor of a few had no discernible effect on the results ( i.e. , this is not the result of a coincidence of fundamental frequencies and overtones with the particular choice for the perturbation frequency ) .",
    "similar results concerning the relative amplitudes of various modes when @xmath26 is varied can actually be extracted from the study of rezzolla and collaborators .",
    "in particular , figure  3 in @xcite shows the response ( in the density ) of a torus with constant angular momentum when given an impulsive perturbation . the first overtone is weaker than the fundamental by a factor of @xmath121 .",
    "however , results for tori with power  law distributions in @xmath26 show a much larger contrast , with the fundamental and its harmonics dominating the frequency spectrum , and p  mode overtones being much weaker ( about three orders of magnitude , see figure  4 in @xcite ) . to complicate matters , it would appear that the way in which the pertrubation is applied ( e.g. , only in the density vs. only in the velocity , or both ) has an important effect on the amplitude of the response ( see figure  5 in @xcite ) . in calculating the eigenfunctions for the height ",
    "integrated problem , rezzolla and collaborators have found that these become vanishingly small near the inner edge of the torus in certain cases , thus making these modes harder to excite . in all cases , and as one would expect , they report that the most efficient way to excite oscillations is to use a perturbation which matches the corresponding eigenfunction ( i.e. , this is when the strongest response occurs ) .",
    "we have only attempted one type of pertrubation here , given in equation  ( 25 ) , and so have not explored this effect .",
    "the vanishing of the eigenfunction may explain formally why certain oscillations are suppressed , or equivalently , why they are so hard to excite with arbitrary perturbations .",
    "in the context of qpos in lmxbs , producing variability in the x  ray lightcurve from the oscillations described here is beyond the scope of this work ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * for how this may actually come about ) .",
    "however , if it is actually related to the qpos , one could argue that the presence of definite frequencies , and their relation to one another , may serve as an indicator of the distribution of angular momentum within the disc , or of its relative thickness .",
    "we believe the study presented here captures the essentials of the simple system at hand , namely , one with pure hydrodynamics in the field of a central object , neglecting self gravity and assuming azimuthal symmetry . clearly in a real astrophysical situation these conditions will not be strictly met .",
    "magnetic fields are likely to play an important role and make the system more complex by introducing additional possible modes , as well as coupling to the hydrodynamics . even without magnetic fields",
    ", the tori described here will not be isolated in a vaccuum , but surrounded by a gaseous envelope , the rest of the disk .",
    "mode coupling and/or leakage at the interface is likely to affect the oscillatory behaviour of the system and is a consideration that deserves further study ( for a preliminary study addressing these matters see * ? ? ?",
