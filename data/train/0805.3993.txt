    "adjoint representation amplitudes must vanish whenever an external gluon is replaced by a color neutral photon , giving a `` photon decoupling identity ''  @xcite ( also referred to as the subcyclic property ) . more generally , the kleiss - kuijf relations  @xcite reduce the number of independent @xmath0-point tree partial amplitudes from @xmath1 to @xmath2 partial amplitudes .    in this paper",
    "we propose a kinematic identity that further constrains the @xmath0-point color - ordered partial amplitudes at tree - level .",
    "this is based on the observation that gauge - theory amplitudes can be rearranged into a form where the kinematic factors of diagrams describing the amplitudes satisfy an identity analogous to the jacobi identity obeyed by the color factors associated with the same diagrams . at four points",
    "this kinematic identity has been used previously to explain certain zeroes in cross sections  @xcite . by solving the generated set of equations at higher - points ,",
    "we obtain new nontrivial relations amongst color - ordered tree amplitudes , reducing the number of independent partial amplitudes to @xmath3 .",

    "will _ not _ satisfy this new identity in isolation beyond four points .",
    "rather the kinematic factors satisfying the identity only appear after rearranging terms between contributing feynman diagrams into convenient representations of the amplitudes . in this paper",
    "we do not present a complete proof that this rearrangement is always possible .",
    "however , because of the many explicit tree - level checks that we have performed , and because of its close connection to the color jacobi identity , we expect this new @xmath0-point identity to hold for tree - level color - ordered yang - mills amplitudes . in this paper",
    "we will focus on gluonic amplitudes .    although the amplitude relations derived from the new kinematic identity may be helpful in tree and one - loop calculations , powerful computational methods are already available , or are under development  @xcite . in the past decade important",

    "in this section we set up the terminology , notation and review a number of pertinent results directly relevant for our subsequent discussion .      at tree level , with particles all in the adjoint representation of @xmath6 , the full tree amplitude can be decomposed as @xmath7   \\ , a^\\tree_n ( 1,2,3 , \\ldots , n ) , \\label{treedecomposition}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is a tree - level color - ordered @xmath0-leg partial amplitude . the @xmath9 s",

    "a decomposition of this type was given in refs .",
    "@xcite . for tree level , this decomposition is similar to the one in using , instead , color matrices in the adjoint representation ( the @xmath14 s ) , and summing over fewer partial amplitudes .",
    "color - ordered tree - level amplitudes satisfy a set of well - known relations .",
    "the simplest of these are the cyclic and reflection properties , @xmath15 next there is the `` photon''-decoupling identity ( or subcyclic property )  @xcite , @xmath16 where the sum runs over all cyclic permutations of legs @xmath17 . this identity follows by replacing @xmath18 in the full amplitude ( [ treedecomposition ] ) corresponding to replacing leg @xmath11 with a `` photon '' .",

    "more generally , for multiplicity @xmath0 , the kleiss - kuijf relations can be used to rewrite any color - ordered partial amplitude in terms of only @xmath2 basis partial amplitudes , where two legs are held fixed in the ordering .",
    "for the two - loop four - point identical - helicity pure gluon and two - loop mhv amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric yang - mills theory , a color decomposition in terms of @xmath14 has been given in terms of `` parent '' diagrams establishing both the color and kinematic structure  @xcite , @xmath32 \\ , , \\label{fcolor}\\ ] ] where `` @xmath33 '' signifies that one should add the two cyclic permutations of @xmath28 .",

    "as we shall see these numerator factors satisfy an identity analogous to the jacobi identity ( [ jacobiidentity ] ) for adjoint representation color factors . for four - point tree amplitudes this identity may appear to be a curiosity , but as we will see below , the consequences at higher points and loops will be rather nontrivial .",
    "interestingly , the identity had been noted almost three decades ago at the four - point level  @xcite .    to derive the identity",
    "we will utilize general properties of adjoint representation gluonic amplitudes . as explained in ,",
    "color - ordered tree - level amplitudes satisfy a photon - decoupling identity  @xcite . at four points",
    "we have , @xmath80 to exploit this equation , we note that tree amplitudes in general are rational functions of polarization vectors , spinors , momenta and mandelstam invariants , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where the @xmath60 are outgoing massless momenta , corresponding to each external leg @xmath45 .",
    "because the decoupling identity ( [ decouplingfour ] ) does not rely on the specific polarizations or space - time dimension , the cancellation is entirely due to the amplitude s dependence on the mandelstam variables .",
    "in particular , it can not rely on four - dimensional spinor identities .",
    "we recognize that the only nontrivial way this can happen is for the sum in be equivalent to the vanishing of @xmath84 as follows : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a shared factor that depends on the polarizations and momenta . from",
    ", the partial amplitudes should be proportional to each other .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath87 treats any factors of @xmath77 and @xmath78 the same , its contribution to should be proportional to @xmath88 .",
    "we therefore make the following identification , @xmath89 similar considerations give , @xmath90 consistent with . after eliminating @xmath86",
    "we obtain the following relations between four point amplitudes , @xmath91    we note that the well - known four - point tree - level helicity amplitudes in @xmath92 explicitly satisfy this .",
    "for example , pure gluon amplitudes in the two color orders , @xmath93 satisfy the relations ( [ fourpointrelation ] ) .",
    "the @xmath94 and @xmath95 are spinor inner products of weyl spinors , using notation of refs .",
    "@xcite .    to obtain the kinematic analog of the jacobi identity we exploit the fact that the color - ordered tree amplitudes can be expanded in a convenient representation in terms of the poles that appear , @xmath96",
    "practically , this can be done in terms of feynman diagrams ( by absorbing the quartic contact terms into the cubic diagrams ) .",
    "one may also think of the numerators as unknown until solved for , and thus defines the @xmath97 s .",
    "the sign flipping is due to the antisymmetry of color - ordered feynman rules .",
    "( the overall signs of the numerators depend on our choice of conventions . of course",
    ", trivial redefinitions of the type @xmath98 , can be used to modify the signs used to define the @xmath97 , but this can not change the actual value of the diagram or residues that the numerators correspond to . )    comparing to gives us the desired kinematic numerator identity , @xmath99 with the chosen sign conventions in , this is exactly of the same form as the jacobi identity for the color factors given in .    using the definition of the fully dressed amplitude and the partial amplitude form , after converting to the @xmath39 s",
    ", we obtain a color - dressed representation , @xmath100 where the color factors are given in ( [ jacobiidentity ] ) .",
    "with our sign conventions the signs in this color - dressed diagram representation are all positive .",
    "note that the form of is very similar to the usual expansion in terms of feynman diagrams , except that we decomposed the four - point contact terms according to their color factors . in absorbing the contact terms into we",
    "must ensure that no cross terms , such as @xmath101 , appear .",
    "we may take the kinematic numerators to be local in the external polarizations and momenta .",
    "a natural question is whether these objects are unique gauge - invariant quantities .",
    "one check would be to consider the limit @xmath102 of the @xmath103 amplitude , where the four - point amplitude factorizes into two three - point amplitudes , each of which are manifestly gauge invariant . from this",
    "we would conclude that @xmath104 is gauge invariant in the @xmath105 factorization limit .",
    "( to make @xmath104 nonvanishing in the limit we may use complex momenta  @xcite .",
    ") however , we should think of @xmath106 as essentially an @xmath77-channel feynman diagram , and of course individual feynman diagrams are not gauge invariant , so we would properly conclude that @xmath104 is gauge dependent for nonzero values of @xmath77 and , more generally , dependent on the choice of field variables . under the assumption that @xmath104 is local , this freedom corresponds to all possible terms that can be added to @xmath104 which cancel the @xmath107 pole .",
    "we will call this a `` gauge freedom '' , because the gauge transformations are a familiar concept corresponding to a freedom of moving terms between diagrams .",
    "we may parametrize this freedom as , @xmath108 where @xmath109 is local .",
    "this corresponds to a contact term ambiguity , and it does not change the residue of the @xmath77-pole . however , to keep the value of the tree amplitudes in unchanged we must simultaneously change @xmath110 and @xmath111 , @xmath112 notice that this is exactly what is needed to make the sum of the shifted numerators vanish , @xmath113 therefore the transformation in and has the effect of moving contact terms between the @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 channel diagrams without altering the numerator identity  ( [ twistidentity2 ] ) .",
    "although the numerators depend on the gauge choices , the identity ( [ twistidentity2 ] ) remains true for all gauges .",
    "as we shall see in , this property is special to four points . at higher points , only specific choices of numerators",
    "will satisfy the analogous identities and the form obtained from generic gauge feynman diagrams will not .",
    "in general we can choose the numerators to be local .",
    "it should be noted , however , that even if we allow @xmath109 to be nonlocal , the kinematic identity remains true .",
    "this follows from the observation that we did not use any locality constraints on the @xmath97 s or @xmath109 in arriving at either or .",
    "so one can choose the @xmath97 to be nonlocal without affecting the value of the amplitudes .",
    "we can even set any one of the @xmath97 to zero .",
    "for example , choosing @xmath114 we get @xmath115 .",
    "this then puts a @xmath79 pole into the numerators @xmath116 and @xmath117 , making them nonlocal .",
    "in fact this choice takes us back to the relations found in the beginning of this section in . in the next section",
    ", we will obtain nontrivial relations between higher - point tree - level partial amplitudes , by choosing nonlocal numerators .",
    "in this section we generalize the relations found at four points to higher points . to do this",
    "we will promote to be the master identity of this paper .",
    "we will use the close analogy between this kinematic numerator identity and the color - group jacobi identity to apply it to higher - point tree - level amplitudes .",
    "we will find that this is indeed possible given that certain extra conditions are satisfied .",
    "specifically , given three dependent color factors @xmath118 associated with tree - level color diagrams , we propose that color - ordered scattering amplitudes can always be decomposed into kinematic diagrams with numerator factors @xmath119 that obey the analogous numerator identity , @xmath120      5 truein    first consider the five - point case .",
    "we may again represent the amplitudes in terms of diagrams with purely cubic interactions .",
    "these diagrams specify the poles , examples of which are given in .",
    "as in the four - point case we absorb any contact terms into the numerator factors of these diagrams . in total",
    "there are 15 independent diagrams with two kinematic poles . in order for the four - point numerator identity to generalize",
    "we require that the numerators of the 15 independent diagrams can be arranged so that they satisfy exactly the same identities as the @xmath39 composed color factors .",
    "for example , consider the diagrams in .",
    "interpreting these diagrams as color diagrams we immediately see that as a consequence of the jacobi identity they satisfy the color - factor identity , @xmath121 where @xmath122 if the kinematic numerators are to satisfy a corresponding identity we must ensure that contact term contributions are associated with the proper numerator .",
    "this is not automatic , as we can easily check .",
    "even color - ordered feynman diagrams at five points , in isolation , do not generally satisfy the identity .",
    "rather the numerator factors correspond to rearrangements of the feynman diagrams .    in general , a color - ordered five - point tree amplitude consist of five diagrams , @xmath123 where we use the notation @xmath124 , and the numerators",
    "are simply labeled @xmath97 for @xmath125 .",
    "again we take the external momenta , @xmath60 , to be massless and outgoing .",
    "the color - ordered five - point amplitudes are symmetric under cyclic permutations and antisymmetric under reflections .",
    "this means that there are at most 12 color orders that are not trivially related .",
    "we have not yet made use of the kleiss - kuijf relations  @xcite given in .",
    "doing so reduces the number of independent amplitudes down to only six , @xmath126 where the 15 numerator factors are distinguished by the propagator structure that accompany them .",
    "the relative signs are again due to the antisymmetry of the color - ordered feynman vertices , or alternatively the antisymmetry of the color factors .",
    "it is important to note that the diagram expansion on the right - hand side of will satisfy the kleiss - kuijf relations .",
    "in fact , the kleiss - kuijf relations can be understood from this perspective : any color - ordered amplitudes that have an expansion in terms of diagrams with only totally antisymmetric cubic vertices will automatically satisfy the kleiss - kuijf relations .",
    "the full color - dressed amplitudes can also be expressed in terms of the kinematic numerators @xmath97 and color factors via , @xmath127 where the color factors are explicitly given by , @xmath128 the number of independent color factors always coincide with the number of partial amplitudes that are independent under the kleiss - kuijf relations .",
    "this can , for example , be seen in the color decomposition of ref .",
    "there are six independent five - point partial amplitudes , corresponding to the six independent color factors @xmath129 .",
    "the other color factors are related to these six by the jacobi identity . at five points ,",
    "this means that there can be no more than six independent @xmath97 s , if the corresponding numerator identity is to generalize . if these coincide  as they do  we might expect that we should pick exactly one basis numerator per amplitude , for example the numerator of the first term of every amplitude in .",
    "however , this choice is likely not optimal for our purposes .",
    "naively , such a diagram basis would correspond to six choices of gauge - dependent quantities which may not necessarily be mutually compatible .",
    "if we instead pick @xmath130 and then define @xmath131 and @xmath132 , using , @xmath133 then fewer gauge - dependent choices are made , and the consistency of amplitudes @xmath134 and @xmath135 is automatically guaranteed .",
    "( here we have defined @xmath132 in terms of @xmath136 and @xmath137 but this will not cause any problems , as they turn out to depend only on @xmath138 . )    we require that the remaining numerators , @xmath139 , satisfy the same jacobi identity equations as the corresponding color factors associated with each diagram .",
    "for example , we require , @xmath140 where the color factors and numerators correspond to , and the explicit values of the color factors are given in .",
    "working our way through all possible jacobi identities at five points we find ten numerator identities , @xmath141 where the last equation is redundant . solving for the nine numerators , @xmath139 , then gives , @xmath142 we may now replace @xmath136 and @xmath137 in our definition of @xmath132 , @xmath143 note that both @xmath131 and @xmath132 appear to be nonlocal quantities in general , but by adjusting @xmath138 in we can cancel poles in @xmath144 and @xmath145 , making all numerators local .",
    "any one of the five - point color - ordered tree amplitudes @xmath146 can now be found by writing down the diagram expansion and plugging in the solutions of the corresponding numerator factors from the numerator identities ( [ n5twistsolution ] ) , ( [ twistsolution ] ) and ( [ n6twistsolution ] ) .",
    "the amplitudes will be functions of six parameters : the four gauge - dependent numerators @xmath130 and the two gauge - independent amplitudes @xmath147 .",
    "however , since @xmath148 are gauge dependent this construction may seem problematic .",
    "indeed we must check that the construction is consistent with the known properties of amplitudes .",
    "we verify consistency by considering all factorization channels of the five - point tree amplitudes . in these limits",
    "each five - point amplitude factorizes into the product of a three - point and a four - point amplitude . in the factorization channels the five - point numerator equations  ( [ twisteqns ] ) reduce to the four - point numerator identity  ( [ twistidentity2 ] ) .",
    "thus , any potential violation of the general numerator identity must come from contact terms that vanish in all of these limits .",
    "similarly , as the five - point numerator equations are gauge invariant in these factorization channels , the relevant terms that potentially break the gauge invariance of the five - point identity must be exactly these contact terms .",
    "therefore , we need to investigate how the five - point numerators behave under the freedom , @xmath149 let us , for the moment , treat the @xmath150 s as local objects , but otherwise arbitrary functions of the kinematics and polarizations . by construction @xmath134 and @xmath135",
    "are invariant under this freedom , since @xmath131 and @xmath132 are constrained so as to correctly reproduce these amplitudes .",
    "from the definition of @xmath131 and @xmath132 we obtain the transformations , @xmath151 remarkably , we find the four remaining amplitudes in are also invariant under these transformations .",
    "plugging in the shifts of numerators @xmath152 into the remaining @xmath97 using gives a set of nontrivial cancellations , @xmath153 where @xmath154 .",
    "as for the four - point case , there is no need to restrict the @xmath150 parameters to be local .",
    "in fact we can pick the @xmath150 s so that @xmath155 , which implies that the explicit dependence on these parameters in the amplitudes cancel out",
    ". hence , our construction is completely gauge invariant since the amplitudes in depend only on the two gauge - invariant basis amplitudes @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "feeding the numerator solutions in eqs.([n5twistsolution ] ) , ( [ twistsolution ] ) and ( [ n6twistsolution ] ) into , we find remarkably simple relations , @xmath158 independent of @xmath138 .",
