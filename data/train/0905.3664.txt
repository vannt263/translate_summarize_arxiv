    "spectro - photometric evolutionary synthesis models are the basic tools to obtain information about age , metallicity , mass , star formation history and other properties of objects whose stellar populations are unresolved .",
    "population synthesis has proven to be now even more important to analyze data obtained from large surveys or / and from high redshift galaxies and to extract the star formation histories of millions of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "almost all the models used to study the integrated properties of stellar systems rest now on the notion , first introduced by tinsley ( 1972 ) , that the stellar birthrate can be split into the product of a time independent function providing the star mass distribution , the initial mass function ( imf ) , and a mass independent function providing the star formation rate . in this way the integrated properties of a galaxy can be modeled as a combination of simple stellar populations ( ssp ) , that can be considered the building blocks of the population synthesis technique @xcite .",
    "there have been in the past many studies devoted to the computation of integrated properties of simple stellar populations , e.g. @xcite .",
    "important differences between these ssp models arise from the use of different stellar tracks ( or isochrones ) , different stellar atmosphere libraries , different spectral coverage and resolution , inclusion of nebular emission and different input physics and computational algorithms .",
    "it is also worth noticing that many of the existing codes are optimized for the application to particular types of objects .",
    "for example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter stb99 ) is tuned to analyze starburst galaxies , while other standard evolutionary synthesis models are mainly suited for old stellar populations .    particularly important today",
    ", where a large observational effort is devoted to high redshift galaxies , is the ability to accurately describe the concomitant presence of very young and intermediate age ( from a fraction to a few gyr ) stellar populations .",
    "indeed , in the studies of high redshift galaxies , it has been shown that the use of models based on different ingredients may change dramatically the estimates of ages and masses of the underlying stellar populations @xcite .",
    "this piece of work is the first paper of a series of three dedicated to popstar models description and initial test - cases application . in this paper , paper i",
    ", we describe popstar models and show their good calibration with previous ones .",
    "we emphasize their suitability to model stellar populations in a wide range of age and metallicity .",
    "paper ii summarizes the results of computing the emission line spectra of the hii regions ionized by the youngest star clusters and compares these results with a sample of hii regions where the metallicity has been carefully determined through appropriate calibrators .",
    "finally , paper iii calculates the photometrical properties of young star clusters , taking into account the contamination by the emission lines in the computed colors and the underlying old populations where these clusters are embedded with the aim of being able to determine the cluster physical properties from the photometrical information only in order to apply to large photometrical surveys .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present an updated version of our evolutionary synthesis code @xcite that makes it suitable for the study of a wide range of stellar populations , from those extremely young to the oldest one , in a widest as possible spectral range .",
    "this is required on one side by the increasing relevance of young and intermediate age stellar populations in observed magnitudes and colours of high redshift galaxies and , on the other , by the advent of multi - band observations that cover at least from the rest frame far uv to beyond the near infrared .",
    "we present a new code that combines a revision of the padova isochrones used in @xcite , mainly in the computation of intermediate age stellar populations , with the best updated stellar model spectra , including nebular emission for the youngest ages .",
    "the ssp spectra are based on the stellar atmosphere models by @xcite and @xcite for normal and massive stars , respectively , and the planetary nebula models by @xcite . the main reason for avoiding the use of empirical libraries ,",
    "is that they still provide an incomplete coverage of the parameter space ( effective temperature , gravity , metallicity , wavelength ) .",
    "the reason to avoid the use of other theoretical atmosphere libraries with good parameter space coverage and even finer spectral resolution , is that the latter models have not been yet carefully tested against observations as the one we have adopted .",
    "the models presented here are thus at medium spectral resolution and they have not been computed for comparison with high spectral resolution observations , like those recently published by @xcite .",
    "however there are not , at the moment , high resolution spectra for all the stellar phases considered in this paper , and thus we paid more attention to the wide wavelength coverage , because our goal is to provide models useful for the study of high redshift galaxies .",
    "finally we remind that in the last decade it was recognized the importance of considering the effects of dust , not only for the extinction but also for the re - emission of the light in the mid and far infrared spectral regions , with the consequent extension of the population synthesis into these new spectral windows @xcite and even into the radio window @xcite . as for the majority of literature models ,",
    "also those presented here do not account for this effect directly , but they can be used in existing galaxy spectral evolution codes that account for the effects of dust as e.g. grasil @xcite .    the plan of the paper is the following . in section 2",
    "we summarize the main characteristics of evolutionary tracks ( padova 94 ) , isochrone calculation and stellar atmosphere models adopted . in section 3 we illustrate and discuss the inclusion of the nebular contribution . in section 4",
    "we present the photometrical evolution of our ssp and compare it with that obtained by other selected models existing in literature .",
    "finally , our conclusions are drawn in section 5 .",
    "the grid is composed by simple stellar populations ( ssp ) for six different imf s whose characteristics are summarized in table  [ imfs ] . the @xcite power law , @xmath0 with @xmath11.35 with mass limits : a ) between 0.85 and 120 m@xmath2 , and b ) between 1.00 and 100 m@xmath2 , have been used for comparison with other set of models , in particular @xcite and stb99 @xcite , respectively .",
    "the others imf functions listed in table  [ imfs ] are @xcite , @xcite,@xcite and @xcite , all of them computed with masses between 0.15 and 100 m@xmath2 .",
    "the expressions are :    @xmath3    the isochrones used in this work have been computed for six different metallicities : z @xmath4 0.0001 , 0.0004 , 0.004 , 0.008 , 0.02 and 0.05 adopting stellar evolutionary tracks from @xcite and @xcite . while the general properties of the stellar evolutionary tracks can be found in the above papers , we stress here a few points that are relevant for the present paper .",
    "_ a ) mass loss _ mass - loss is an important ingredient in the context of this paper because , in old and intermediate age stellar populations it determines the current stellar mass on the horizontal branch and on the post asymptotic giant branch ( p - agb ) phases while , in young populations , it affects the relative distribution between supergiant and wolf rayet single stars .    along the red giant branch ( rgb ) phase of low mass stars",
    ", mass loss is accounted for by means of the reimers formulation , assuming @xmath5 = 0.50 independently of the metallicity as suggested by @xcite and more recently by @xcite .",
    "the agb phase of old and intermediate age populations is calculated according to @xcite .",
    "the adopted value of @xmath5 is slightly larger than that assumed by @xcite , @xmath5 = 0.45 .",
    "however with these prescriptions the isochrones reproduce fairly well the uv integrated properties of globular clusters @xcite , and the observed spitzer irs spectra and mid infrared colours of ellipticals in virgo @xcite , and coma @xcite , clusters , i.e. old stellar populations likely at the two extremes of the metallicity range of stellar systems . at intermediate ages ,",
    "the colours compare well with the observations of lmc clusters @xcite as shown later in figure [ vktest ] .    the mass loss formulation adopted in massive stars is amply described in the relative quoted papers .",
    "here we remind that it was included in the computation of the evolutionary tracks with a metallicity dependence @xmath6 , _ independently from the evolutionary status_. the surface hydrogen , helium and carbon abundances are used to discriminate blue supergiant form wolf rayet ( wr ) stars , and to identify the main wn and wc evolutionary phases , as described in @xcite . in this respect we remind that , besides mass loss , the appearance of the wr phase depends strongly also on other input physics like the stellar rotation @xcite and/or the evolution within a binary system ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with suitable orbital parameters .",
    "these effects are not included in our treatment .",
    "_ b ages _ the age coverage is from @xmath7 5.00 to 10.30 with a variable time resolution which is @xmath8 in the youngest stellar ages . at ages of a few million years",
    ", low mass stars are still contracting on the main sequence .",
    "this is not very important for the integrated properties because , under our imf assumptions , the integrated luminosity is dominated by the most massive stars . at these young ages however , the latter stars may be still embedded in their parent molecular cloud , with the consequence that their ionizing spectra may be heavily modified by extinction .",
    "the effect in these cases would be that dust may attenuate the flux of ionizing photons , changing the total intensity and hardness of the ionizing spectrum .",
    "this effect is not considered in this paper but it will be the subject of a forthcoming investigation devoted to the effects of dust in young star forming regions . nevertheless , our results are applicable to many star formation regions ( e.g. giant extragalactic hii regions ) that are not dominated by dust ( massive stars are cleary visible even at uv images taken with hst ) .    _",
    "c ) stochastic effects _",
    "when dealing with relatively low populated stellar systems it has been suggested that stochastic effects may significantly affect the comparison between models and observations .",
    "this is a wavelength dependent effect because stars in different evolutionary phases do not affect the various spectral regions in the same way .",
    "several papers have been devoted to the analysis of stochastic effects in evolutionary synthesis models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "tuning the content of massive stars in star - forming regions via mass segregation related to stochastic effect was suggested by @xcite as an alternative to an imf steepening to decrease the number of massive stars , what helped to explain the emission line ratios observed in giant extragalactic high metallicity hii regions . as we will show in paper ii these observations can now naturally be fitted by popstar models , without the need of introducing this effect .",
    "moreover , observations with hst show evidence against these stochastic effects in star forming regions , since very massive stars have been detected even in small clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "remarkable differences appear at ages between 100 - 900 myr when , in our isochrones , planetary nebulae appear .",
    "the nature of this discrepancy is certainly the higher fuel of our post agb stars , due to the different mass loss rate prescriptions adopted in our revised isochrones , besided the use of the model spectra from @xcite .",

    "our popstar results are represented by red solid lines while for stb99 we use blue dashed lines .",
    "notice that stb99 models are calculated only until 1 gyr .",
    "magnitudes b and v are practically identical in both cases .",
    "however , the k band shows slight differences with brighter ( redder ) stellar population for the youngest ages in our models compared with the stb99 ones , mostly for z@xmath40.004 , at low metallicity .",
    "the same occurs for ages @xmath10 myr : stb99 models are less bright than ours in k band .",

    "the agreement is good .",
    "however , at solar metallicity there are some differences in the rsg colours ( especially v - k ) while , at low metallicity , there are differences in the agb phase ( likely caused by different mass loss rates ) and at very young ages ( likely caused by differences in nebular emission continuum contribution ) .      here",
    "we compare our results with galaxev models @xcite that are particularly well suited for old populations .",

    "b - v , v - r , v - i and v - k colours . for all models",
    "we have assumed a chabrier imf with solid red lines indicating our popstar models and dashed blue lines depicting the corresponding galaxev models . left hand panels show the evolution for z@xmath40.0001 while , right hand panels , refer to z@xmath40.02 . at young ages our colours are significantly redder than those of bc03 , mainly because bc03 do not include the effects of nebular continuum . to show this we plot in fig .",
    "[ mag_comp_bc03 ] as short - dashed red lines the results obtained for the popstar stellar spectra without the continuum nebular contribution .",
    "the results are very similar to those ones from bc03 .",
    "the difference popstar - bc03 increases at decreasing metallicity because the strength of the nebular emission increases at decreasing metallicity . as already said , including this contribution at young ages , produces a reddening of the v - k colours from two to three magnitudes , depending on the initial metallicity .",
    "this contribution is thus relevant and should be included in the interpretation of the spectral evolution of star forming galaxies . at intermediate and old ages the differences in magnitudes and in colours are small , in particular for the case of solar metallicity . at low metallicity",
    "the difference become larger , especially in the v - k .",
    "the origin of this difference is most likely a different algorithm to describe the mass loss rates .",
    "this can be seen also from fig .",
    "[ sp_comp ] , where we perform a comparison of the spectral evolution of a solar metallicity ssp , predicted by different authors .",
    "we notice that , contrary to the other models , a significant post agb phase is already present after 100 myr in our models . from the same figure",
    "we may also notice the effects of the inclusion of the new spectra of planetary nebulae .",
    "both effects combine to produce a p - agb phase with a lower far uv luminosity .",
    "we have also compared our popstar results with mar05 models .",
    "the evolution of selcted magnitudes and colours are shown in fig .",
    "[ mag_comp_mar ] and fig .",
    "[ col_comp_mar ] , respectively .",
    "we have used the same symbols and line coding used in the previous figures .",
    "since mar05 does not include nebular emission , a large difference is present at very young ages , as before .",
    "there are also differences at older ages which may reach a magnitude in the v - k colour .",
    "the differences with respect to mar05 models are in general larger than those with respect to bc03 models    finally , fig .",
    "[ sp_comp ] shows the comparison of the spectral evolution computed with popstar for a ssp with solar metallicity and a sal2 imf with other codes existing in literature , @xcite named as stb99 , @xcite as bc03 , @xcite as mar05 , @xcite as gon05 , and with our old models , @xcite as mgv00 , at some selected ages , as given in each panel .    from this figure",
    "it appears that mar05 models lack both the hard ionizing flux of the wolf rayet stars as well as that of post agb stars .",
    "on the other hand stb99 models lack the the post - agb phase .",
    "gon05 models were calculated with higher resolution but within a shorter wavelength range ( from 3000 to 7000  ) than the other models .",
    "the only models that include the hard ionizing flux of wr stars and that of p - agb stars are those by bc03 and our , old and new , ones .",
    "our new models are similar to our old mgv models .",
    "however the different procedure of temperature assignation and the different spectral library adopted , in the wr phase , result in a significantly less hard ionizing spectra this effects is also present in the post - agb phase .",
    "the nebular continuum is now more accurate because it includes not only the hydrogen but also the helium contribution .",
    "furthermore , in the common wavelength range , our new models compare very well also with gon05 models .    from fig .",
    "[ sp_comp ] we see that our models reproduce very well the behavior of the stb99 models at young ages .",
    "moreover popstar models follow very well the evolution of the galaxev and mar05 models at old ages . thus",
    "since stb99 models were specifically calibrated for starburst galaxies while galaxev and mar05 were mainly calibrated for intermediate / old ages , we conclude that popstar models can be safely used over the whole age range of stellar populations .",
    "we have computed new synthesis models that follow the evolution of simple stellar populations from very young to very old ages . to this purpose",
    "we have combined the homogeneous and well calibrated set of padova 94 stellar evolution models , with the most recent physics input concerning stellar atmospheres and , where needed , nebular continuum emission . besides spectra over a wide wavelength range ,",
    "these models provide a large quantity of additional information , useful for the analysis of the properties of stellar populations ( see appendix a ) .    from the comparison of our models with previous evolutionary synthesis models",
    ", we have shown that our models are well calibrated and can be safely applied over the whole age range of stellar populations .",
    "this is particularly important because we have shown that not all existing models include all the relevant evolutionary phases of stellar populations    for this reason our models are particularly suited for the study of galaxies where a combination of stellar populations of different ages and metallicities coexist .    our new models , the resulting seds and hr diagrams are available in the virtual observatory ( models in http://esavo.esa.int/vospec/ and the popstar web - page at http://www.fractal-es.com/sedmod.htm ) .",
