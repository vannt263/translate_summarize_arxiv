    "@xmath0 meson production reactions explore a rich domain of phenomena at the interface of nuclear and particle physics .",
    "these reactions have the potential for expanding our understanding of the formation of nucleon resonances and their propagation in the nuclear medium .",
    "moreover , as has been shown recently , these reactions have allowed more precise determination of the mass of the @xmath0 meson and the study of its rare decays @xcite .",
    "the spin - isospin characteristics of the @xmath0 lead to a selectivity of resonance channels that can be formed through its interactions with a nucleon . at energies near the threshold of its production",
    ", there is a significant preference for the excitation of the s@xmath5(1535 ) resonance which is known to decay nearly 50% of the time to an @xmath0 meson and a nucleon .",
    "by contrast , the s@xmath5(1650 ) , which has identical characteristics , has only a decay rate below 2% .",
    "the understanding of these dissimilar branching ratios is still an open question and may be a reflection of important and subtle differences in the detailed substructures of these resonances . the selectivity mentioned above makes the @xmath0 meson production reactions an important tool for studying the physics of the s@xmath5(1535 ) resonance .    until recently the production of @xmath0 mesons using photon beams has been largely confined to proton targets .",
    "the advent of high - duty - cycle electron accelerators such as those at the jefferson lab , mainz , bates and other laboratories , has opened up novel possibilities of performing production experiments on complex nuclei @xcite .",
    "the elementary reaction @xmath6 has been the subject of several studies .",
    "@xcite developed an effective lagrangian approach to study this reaction .",
    "contributions from nucleon resonances , t - channel vector meson as well as the nucleon born diagrams are included .",
    "calculations were performed at the tree level and included eight free parameters .",
    "the @xmath7 was found to be the dominant contributor to the reaction at energies close to threshold .",
    "in addition , from comparisons with the data , the authors concluded that there is no clear preference for using pseudoscalar (  ps  ) or pseudovector (  pv  ) coupling forms for the interaction vertices of the @xmath0 meson with the nucleon and nucleon resonances .",
    "bennhold and tanabe @xcite developed a somewhat different approach to @xmath0 photoproduction on the nucleon .",
    "they used a coupled channel isobar model , in which the reaction is related to @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 reactions .",
    "they included contributions from three resonances : s@xmath5(1535 ) , p@xmath5(1440 ) and d@xmath11(1520 ) .",
    "the data on the elementary reaction appeared to favor the ps form of the @xmath0nn vertex .",
    "the authors employed the resulting elementary amplitude to study coherent and incoherent photoproduction of @xmath0 mesons on nuclei . this model for the elementary process was later extended by tiator _",
    "@xcite to include born as well as @xmath12 and @xmath13 exchange diagrams through effective lagrangians .",
    "the resulting elementary amplitudes were subsequently used to calculate the pwia ( plane wave impulse approximation ) amplitude of the photoproduction reaction on light nuclei .    the elementary amplitude mentioned above",
    "was also used by lee _",
    "@xcite to calculate the amplitude for quasifree photoproduction of @xmath0 mesons on heavier nuclei .",
    "they performed exclusive as well as inclusive reaction calculations using a nonrelativistic approach .",
    "the initial bound nucleon is described by a harmonic oscillator wavefunction and final state interactions of the outgoing particles with the recoil nucleus are introduced through optical potentials .",
    "two different optical potentials were used for the @xmath0 mesons .",
    "the authors found that the photon asymmetry is insensitive to the final state interactions of the outgoing particles as well as the size of the target nucleus .    in this paper",
    "we develop a relativistic model for the (  @xmath14  ) reaction on nuclei leading to specific final states of the residual nuclei ( exclusive reactions ) .",
    "the study of the photoproduction reactions on nuclei compliments the ongoing studies of the production on free nucleons .",
    "in addition to further investigating the reaction mechanism , studies on nuclei can help limit any existing ambiguities in the elementary process .",
    "moreover since the production process is mediated by certain nucleon resonances and vector mesons , these studies open the possibility of investigating medium modifications of the properties of these hadrons in nuclei . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the availability of a new generation of accelerators capable of producing high quality beams of electrons and photons , has led to increased interest in eta photoproduction physics .",
    "many experiments that were not possible in the past are now within reach .    the present work is devoted to quasifree photoproduction .",
    "this type of reaction has the advantage of allowing measurements at small momentum transfer to the residual nucleus .",
    "this , in addition to enhancing the possibility of increased cross sections , compliments the information obtained from coherent and incoherent (  @xmath15  ) reactions which by necessity involve large momentum transfers .    in the present study",
    "we follow a relativistic approach .",
    "this is motivated by the impressive successes of the relativistic mean field approach to nuclear dynamics .",
    "we have recently studied the difference between relativistic and non - relativistic treatments in photonuclear knockout @xcite and quasielastic scattering of electrons @xcite , and have found that there are important differences between the two approaches . in the course of the present study we shall compare our results to those of the work of lee _ et al .",

    "this suppression is more evident at higher @xmath0 energies .",
    "these correspond to smaller energies of the outgoing protons and indicate that these protons are more affected by the distortion .",
    "this same qualitative behavior holds for the @xmath0 meson distortion (  dashed curve  ) ; the suppression is skewed towards smaller @xmath0 energies .",
    "the dotted curve is the calculated cross section when distortion effects are included for both of the outgoing particles .",
    "the suppression of the cross section in this case is much more pronounced .",
    "figure 7-(b ) shows the photon asymmetry for the same reaction ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq35 ] ) ) .",
    "plane wave calculations ( solid curve ) produce a nearly flat curve for the photon asymmetry .",
    "distortion of the outgoing @xmath0 meson affects the shape and magnitude of the photon asymmetry only slightly .",
    "inclusion of the final state interactions of the outgoing proton results in larger changes in the asymmetry . when both final state interactions are included , the resulting curve (  dotted curve  ) has characteristics close to the case when only the proton is distorted .",
    "figure 8 shows the effects of different @xmath0 optical potentials on the calculated observables .",
    "the curves of fig.8 are obtained with the same bound and continuum proton potentials while different optical potentials are used for the outgoing @xmath0 meson .",
    "five different potentials are used . the first two are those ( denoted by dw1 and dw2 ) used by lee _",
    "@xcite.these are obtained in a @xmath119 approximation using @xmath120 t - matrices obtained in a coupled channel approach @xcite ( a recent work by batinic _ et al . _",
    "@xcite points out to a sign error in their analysis in @xcite which may mean that the potential dw2 is not reliable ) . the other sets of potentials are those of chiang _",
    "these are obtained by calculating the @xmath0 self energy in nuclear matter taking into account only contributions from the @xmath50 resonance .",
    "the three different potentials used correspond to three different choices of the real part of the @xmath121 self energy ( namely re@xmath122 with @xmath123=50 , 0 , -50 mev ; @xmath12 and @xmath124 are the nuclear density for finite and infinite nuclear matter , respectively . ) the uncertainty about the parameter @xmath123 is a drawback for the potentials of chiang _",
    "et al._.    in general the calculated cross sections show some dependence on the type of distorting potential used ; there are some variations in shape and magnitude .",
    "the magnitude of the cross section obtained with the dw1 potential is somewhat larger than those predicted by the other potentials near the mid - range of @xmath0 energies .",
    "the corresponding calculations for photon asymmetry with different optical potentials for the outgoing @xmath0 meson are shown in fig.8-(b ) .",
    "all potentials produce approximately the same shape and magnitude for the photon asymmetry .",
    "the asymmetry therefore , at least at this energy , is not particularly sensitive to the different choices of the final state interactions of @xmath0 mesons .",
    "we have also calculated the observables of the reaction using several different proton optical potentials .",
    "we found that the calculated observables are rather insensitive to the variations among these optical potentials .",
    "the sensitivity of the results to the bound state potentials was also assessed by performing calculations in which different binding potentials are used . in this case",
    "relativistic scalar and vector potentials of woods saxon shape @xcite were used to generate the dirac bound state wavefunction .",
    "the results are shown by the dashed curve in fig.9-(a ) along with the results obtained using the hartree potentials adopted throughout the present study (  solid curve  ) .",
    "comparison of these curves indicates the level of sensitivity in our model calculations to the bound state potentials .",
    "this comparison shows that the hartree bound state potentials lead to somewhat larger cross sections at this photon energy . on the other hand",
    "the photon asymmetry calculations appear to be insensitive to different choices of the bound state potentials ( fig.9-(b ) ) .",
    "in addition to the kinematics used above , we also calculated the observables of the reaction for another set of angles for the outgoing particles .",
    "the motivation for choosing this new set is to compare the results of our model with those of the nonrelativistic model of lee _ et al .",
    "figure 10 shows this comparison .",
    "the calculations are performed at the following angular settings for the outgoing particles : @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "we have plotted the results of the non - relativistic plane wave calculations of lee _ et al . _",
    "@xcite together with our results for both plane wave and distorted wave calculations .",
    "figure 10-(a ) shows the cross section and 10-(b ) the resulting photon asymmetry .",
    "results of the relativistic plane wave and distorted wave calculations are shown by solid and short dashed curves , respectively .",
    "the nonrelativistic plane wave calculations are depicted by the long dashed curves .",
    "comparison of the solid and long dashed curves indicates that both relativistic and nonrelativistic calculations produce curves with similar shape , but the nonrelativistic calculations predict generally larger cross sections in the @xmath0 energy range up to @xmath127120 mev , and fall below at higher @xmath0 energies .",
    "there is also a slight shift in the relative positions of the peaks in the two calculations .",
    "as noted earlier , the inclusion of final state interactions leads to a suppression of the calculated cross sections .    the plane wave relativistic and nonrelativistic predictions for the photon asymmetry differ significantly ( note that lee _",
    "_ use a definition of asymmetry which is opposite in sign to the one used here ; for the purpose of the present comparison the results from reference @xcite have been multiplied by -1 ) .",
    "the relativistic calculations produce a flat curve with small positive values , whereas the nonrelativistic calculations result in a curve with large negative values , with strong dependence on the @xmath0 energy .",
    "the relativistic calculations show some sensitivity to final state interactions whereas lee _",
    "_ report such effects are negligible in the nonrelativistic calculations .",
    "we carried out similar calculations for the photoproduction reaction on a @xmath3o target leading to the ground state in @xmath128n .",
    "figure 11 shows the results of these calculations .",
    "the residual nuclear state is assumed to be a pure 1p@xmath129 hole state .",
    "the hartree potentials of reference @xcite are used to calculate the bound state wavefunction .",
    "the final state interactions of the outgoing proton and @xmath0 meson are calculated using the energy dependent global optical potential of reference @xcite and the dw1 optical potential of reference @xcite , respectively .",
    "the results for the cross section are very much similar to the @xmath2c case (  see fig.7  ) . in the case of",
    "@xmath3o we note that the distorted wave cross section ( dotted curve ) is slightly smaller in comparison with the corresponding case in @xmath2c ( dotted curve in fig .",
    "7 ) . on the other hand the resulting photon asymmetries for this target ,",
    "behave differently form those of the @xmath2c target .",
    "the distorted wave calculations here peak at lower @xmath0 energies .",
    "moreover asymmetries for this target have larger magnitudes but this occurs in a region of very small cross sections .",
    "these differences with the @xmath2c case indicate that the asymmetry is dependent on the single particle state from which the proton is ejected .",
    "we have also used our relativistic model for calculations of the reaction on @xmath4ca .",
    "figure 12 shows the results of our calculations for the case in which the residual nucleus ( @xmath130k ) is left in its ground state (  a 1d@xmath114 hole state  ) and the incident photon energy is 750 mev . the calculated cross sections of fig.12-(a ) show curves with different shapes from those of the two targets studied previously .",
    "the final state interactions of the outgoing particles lead to a suppression of the cross section for this target in a manner similar to what has been noted earlier for @xmath2c and @xmath3o .",
    "we find that the earlier observation on photon asymmetries is confirmed in the present case ; the photon asymmetry calculations are sensitive to the final state interactions of the outgoing particles .",
    "this is in contrast to the predictions of the nonrelativistic model for the reaction @xcite .",
    "the shape and magnitude of the asymmetries are different from those found for the @xmath2c and @xmath3o targets .",
    "we have also carried out calculations for the observables of the reaction on a @xmath4ca target leading to an odd parity 1p@xmath114 hole state in @xmath130k .",
    "the results are shown in fig.13 .",
    "the curves in this figure have the same features as in fig.10 , except that the differences in the magnitude of the relativistic and nonrelativistic cross sections are larger .",
    "also the effects of the final state interactions are more prominent for the present case .",
    "note that the photon asymmetries given in figs .",
    "10-(b ) and 13-(b ) have approximately the same shapes .",
    "these similarities and the fact that reaction is taking place on a proton in a 1p@xmath114 state , support our earlier statement on the state dependency of the asymmetry .    the calculations reported in this section have all used a specific set of coupling constants ; one of several that are given in reference @xcite .",
    "the question then arises concerning the sensitivity of the calculated results to the possible differences among these sets which provide nearly equivalent fits to the data for the elementary reactions .",
    "we have carried out calculations using the set given in the first column of table v of reference @xcite .",
    "the results show that there are some changes in the magnitudes of the calculated cross sections and photon asymmetries .",
    "these changes are at the level of 15% for the cross sections but are somewhat larger for the asymmetries .",
    "in this paper we have developed a relativistic model for the quasifree photoproduction of @xmath0 mesons on complex nuclei .",
    "the ingredients of the model are : i ) the nucleon wave functions are solutions of the dirac equation with appropriate scalar and vector potentials consistent with the relativistic mean field approach , ii ) the @xmath0 meson is described by solutions of the klein - gordon equation with appropriate optical potentials , and iii ) the interactions between the fields are introduced through a covariant effective lagrangian .",
    "contributions from nucleon resonances , t - channel vector meson as well as the nucleon born diagrams are included .",
    "the model is used to calculate the cross section and photon asymmetry , for different target nuclei . both plane wave and distorted wave calculations",
    "are presented .",
    "we wish to comment on the question of the gauge invariance of the reaction amplitude calculated in the above manner .",
    "the effective lagrangian we start with is gauge invariant . as we look at the nuclear amplitude itself , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq19 ] ) , we find that its invariance is determined by the behavior of the @xmath102 operators given in eqs.([gammp]-[eq21 ] ) .",
    "all these operators are gauge invariant , except for the electric parts of eq.([gammp ] ) .",
    "these latter terms are invariant only in the limit where the particles involved in the elementary interaction are considered to be on their mass shell .",
    "the energy region where the s@xmath1(1535 ) resonance dominates the reaction is identified . as expected",
    "this region is close to threshold and covers a range of photon energies from 750 mev to 950 mev .",
    "none of the other diagrams makes contributions at the same level as the s@xmath1 .",
    "we find that the next leading diagrams are proton , d@xmath34 resonance and vector meson poles .",
    "however we also find that there is some cancellation among these contributions . in our view",
    "the energy region identified above is perhaps the best suited for using the @xmath0 photoproduction reactions to study the properties of the s@xmath1 resonance in the nuclear medium .    when the final state interactions of the outgoing particles are included , we find that the resulting cross sections are strongly suppressed .",
    "the extent of this suppression depends somewhat on the type of optical potential used to represent the final state interaction .",
    "we find some variations among the available sets of potentials particularly those that describe the @xmath0 meson final state interactions .",
    "several @xmath0 optical potentials were tested and lead to different results for the cross section as well as the photon asymmetry .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath0 optical potentials makes it difficult to make final predictions for the cross sections .",
    "more theoretical work on the final state interactions of the @xmath0 is required .",
    "calculations were carried out using the same kinematics as those in the recent nonrelativistic calculations of lee _ et.al _",
    "results of our calculations for the cross section have shapes close to those of these nonrelativistic calculations but the magnitudes of our results are somewhat smaller .",
    "in contrast , the photon asymmetries predicted by the two models differ significantly .",
    "the nonrelativistic model gives large asymmetries in the plane wave limit , which are found to be insensitive to the final state interactions of the outgoing particles .",
    "our predictions yield much smaller asymmetries and these are strongly affected by the final state interactions .",
    "_ have also found that a small percentage change in the masses of the @xmath50 and @xmath131 have large effects on the cross sections and the asymmetries , respectively .",
    "our present calculations show similar effects .",
    "these are indications that eta photoproduction reactions can be used as a probe of medium modifications of the properties of these resonances .",
    "these of course are expected to go beyond the simple mass shifts ; for example there may in fact be a radial density dependence of the masses of the propagators .",
    "studies of these effects with the present relativistic model are planned .",
    "the above statements indicate that the present reaction is rich in its physics content .",
    "if enough data become available , one will be able to clarify the role played by the intermediate nucleon states ( the @xmath50 and the @xmath131 ) as well as the vector mesons while embedded in the nuclear environment .",
    "the question of the optical potential for the @xmath0-nucleus system could also be clarified .",
    "the data could also be used to assess the need for a strictly relativistic treatment .",
    "it is clear that there is a multiplicity of effects at play and hence it is imperative that measurements at several energies in the region discussed above and for a variety of target nuclei be carried out .",
    "measurements of the cross sections and photon asymmetries in exclusive production , as well as coherent production , will be very helpful in shedding more light on the above issues .",
    "in a subsequent paper the present model will be extended to the treatment of inclusive reactions for which some data have become available recently @xcite .",
