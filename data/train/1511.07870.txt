    "a fundamental question in current astrophysics research on active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is the origin and evolution of supermassive black holes ( smbh ) as well as their interaction with their host galaxy .",
    "a large body of evidence suggests the presence of smbh in nearly all local spheroids ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) and argues that their growth occurs predominantly through accretion processes ( e.g. @xcite ) . in order to study the evolution and properties of smbh",
    ", one should approach them by a preferably unbiased data set of agn .",
    "the main limiting factor in agn selection is the diversity of their spectral energy distributions ( sed ) .",
    "this depends on the presence of dust and gas clouds along the line - of - sight , the contrast between accretion - luminosity and stellar emission from the host galaxy , and the detailed physics of the accretion process itself .",
    "many methods have been developed to account for these factors using different wavelength bands and both photometric as well as spectroscopic selection criteria , but they are always , by construction , subject to selection effects .",
    "the accretion processes in smbhs are highly complex and emit at different wavelengths . in the optical / uv spectra of agn , there is the characteristic ` blue bump ' which is supposed to originate from a thermally radiating accretion disc .",
    "this feature allows agn to be selected via their blue colours , and has been extensively used ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this selection has its limitations because the galaxy dilution as well as the optical obscuration suppress the blue bump .",
    "it is therefore only applied to optically point - like sources .",
    "x - rays directly trace highly energetic processes occurring in the neighbourhood of the supermassive black hole @xcite . thus , x - ray selection is highly efficient and provides a clean separation from the host galaxies which typically emit at lower fluxes .",
    "however , the most heavily obscured , compton - thick agn are opaque even to x - rays . in this case ,",
    "infrared agn selection methods , tracing the reprocessed nuclear emission , benefit from the clearly distinct sed shapes of agn and galaxy components in this wavelength range .",
    "therefore , infrared is able to detect heavily obscured agn @xcite .",
    "another very well - known agn selection criterion is the optical narrow emission line diagnostic @xcite .",
    "it uses the fact that ionizing radiation from the agn is harder than that of stars , which has an effect on the measured emission line ratios .",
    "however , this method is claimed to suffer from ( i ) contamination from the host galaxy which can potential swamp agn signatures and ( ii ) the fact that the method selects a large fraction of low ionization narrow emission region galaxies ( liners ) whose nature is still debated ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "broad emission lines ( @xmath6 ) are unique spectral features which identify optical unobscured agn , where the observer has a direct view on the fast moving clouds close to the black hole . purely board line selected samples of agn have been used for example in the vvds and zcosmos surveys ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is essential to understand the selection function of the different methods for an unbiased census of agn across cosmic time .",
    "different selection methods may not only depend on obscuration or host galaxy contamination , but on other fundamental parameters of the active black hole , such as eddington ratio ( i.e. the ratio between observed accretion rate and the eddington rate ) , instantaneous accretion luminosity , black hole mass , etc .",
    "several works @xcite combined and compared multiple selection methods , such as x - ray , uv , optical , and infrared .",
    "these studies have been performed in areas benefiting from synergies of deep x - ray coverage , multi - wavelength observations and spectroscopic follow - up @xcite , e.g. the cosmos and cdfs field ( @xcite ) and lockman hole ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , most area surveys are limited to few @xmath7 or less .",
    "larger area surveys , such as botes ( @xcite ) , achieve better statistics for rare objects , e.g. luminous agn , and improve clustering studies , but have been difficult to carry out , mainly due to the small field of view of x - ray imaging telescopes .    in this work ,",
    "we present one of the largest spectroscopic surveys of x - ray selected agn ( _ xmm - newton _ ) in a homogenous and contiguous area with the same instrument ( _ boss _ spectrograph of the baryonic oscillation spectroscopic survey ) .",
    "this dataset allows for a more detailed analysis of properties of x - ray selected agn , enables a comparison of selection methods for agn based on different wavelengths , and provides a forecast for the agn population in the _ erosita _ survey and its follow - up programme spiders ( @xcite , merloni et al .",

    "it provides access to large subsamples of agn when selected by luminosity , morphology or obscuration .",
    "furthermore , many multi - wavelength datasets in optical ( e.g. _ cfhtls _ , _ sdss _ ) , infrared ( e.g. _ ukidss _ , _ wise _ , _ video _ ) , uv ( e.g. _ galex _ ) and radio ( e.g. _ vla _ ) bands are available in this field .",
