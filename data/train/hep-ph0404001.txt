    "conclusion is given in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "within sm we have no direct knowledge of right - handed quark mixings , since the weak interaction probes just the left - handed sector . on the other hand , we are still far from a solution to the flavor problem .",
    "susy can in principle bring forth extra right - handed dynamics , but it does not address the flavor issue . as one tries to understand the right - handed flavor sector by assuming afs , near maximal @xmath88-@xmath89 mixing can be realized . with supersymmetric afs , furthermore , maximal @xmath27-@xmath90 squark mixing @xcite brings forth an extra cp violating phase and @xmath91 couplings . as pointed out in @xcite , decoupling the @xmath92 flavor is preferred to evade the constraints from kaon system as much as possible .",
    "with @xmath92 flavor decoupled , we can reduce @xmath93 down quark mass matrix to @xmath94 submatrix relevant to @xmath2 and @xmath3 flavors .",
    "normalized to @xmath95 , the down quark mass matrix element @xmath96 has the diagonal terms @xmath97 and @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the wolfenstein parameter .",

    "nature implies @xmath103 , hence @xmath104 is deduced .",
    "this may be the largest off - diagonal term , but its effects is hidden from our view within the sm . however , introducing susy , its effect may be revealed via the super - partners of right - handed quarks .",
    "decoupling @xmath92 flavor reduces the down squark mass matrix from @xmath105 to @xmath106 . focusing on the @xmath94 @xmath107 submatrix @xmath108 , by the hermitian nature one finds just one extra cp violating phase , denoted as @xmath26 , and we parameterize @xmath108 as , @xmath109 the squark mass eigenvalues are @xmath110 , which are reached by diagonalizing @xmath108 , @xmath111 where @xmath112 absorbs the phase @xmath26 and transfers it to the quark - squark - gluino coupling , and @xmath113 is a measure of the relative weight of @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "clearly , with @xmath116 , in general we have one suppressed eigenvalue @xmath117 due to level splitting .",

    "how light can @xmath127 be depends on the fine tuning one is willing to make . for @xmath128 tev , to get @xmath129 tev the level of tuning is @xmath130 , which is comparable to what is seen in @xmath131 . as had been shown in @xcite , @xmath0 requires @xmath23 to be suitably light , and the gluino should not be too heavy . since we would like to focus on the effects from a light right - handed squark , we fix @xmath132 tev in the following analysis .",
    "we will illustrate the @xmath25 dependence of our results instead .    in our computations ,",
    "we use mass eigenbasis of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sbbase ] ) for right - handed squarks , since off - diagonal elements are large",
    ". however , @xmath133 itself is strongly suppressed by down - type quark masses , and off - diagonal elements of @xmath134 are @xmath135 suppressed .",
    "hence we also use mass insertion approximation for contributions arising from @xmath136 , since perturbative expansion is possible .",
    "@xmath1 mixing can be studied by flavor specific decays such as @xmath137 , but we are more interested in cp violating measurables , especially those that could shed light on potential new physics as hinted by @xmath20 in @xmath21 system . in the following ,",
    "we give results on @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 as they illustrate different aspects .",
    "since new physics effect on these decays is our interest , we employ the naive factorization approach for calculation of hadronic matrix elements .",
    "the decay @xmath4 is a clean mode for the same reason as @xmath11 , _ i.e. _ a single tree amplitude dominates and the relevant ckm matrix element @xmath138 is real .",
    "therefore , this decay mode is promising for the extraction of weak phase information related to @xmath42-@xmath43 mixing , @xmath139 .",
    "since the weak phase of @xmath42-@xmath43 mixing is basically absent in sm , the values of @xmath50 and @xmath140 are governed by new physics effects .",

    "as we will show below , nonvanishing values imply the presence of _ wrong helicity photons_. it is known that `` wrong helicity '' photons from the decay @xmath259 would indicate new physics  @xcite . in our previous work",
    "@xcite we have studied @xmath273 , which was inspired by the recent experimental data on @xmath274 from @xmath275 @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that @xmath272 and @xmath57 are free from hadronic effects such as @xmath276 in @xmath277 .",
    "hadronic effects are largely absorbed in the @xmath278 form factor , which cancels out when forming cp ratios .",
    "the photon radiated from @xmath279 is dominantly left(right)-handed polarized in the sm .",
    "therefore , in the sm , eq .  ( [ eq : timecpi ] ) can be written separately for @xmath280 and @xmath281 to good approximation .",
    "however , @xmath282 is _ not _ a cp eigenstate _ if _ the photon polarization is measured . following ref .",
    "@xcite , the amplitudes are given by @xmath283 where @xmath284 is the relative amount of left(right)-polarized photons , and @xmath285 is the associated cp violating phase .",
    "the measurement of time - dependent cp asymmetry for this mode treats the photon handedness as unmeasured .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ eq : timecpi ] ) should be given by  @xcite @xmath286 where @xmath287 sums over the two separate rates for the final states @xmath288 and @xmath289 .",
    "it is in this way that interference and cp violation can occur .",
    "assuming @xmath290 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : timecpradi ] ) gives @xmath291 and @xmath292 .",
    "the observables @xmath293 and @xmath57 are good probes of right - handed dynamics , as they vanish with @xmath263 .",
    "note that @xmath294 , @xmath272 and @xmath57 do not satisfy @xmath295 , because in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : timecpradi ] ) and ( [ eq : acp_phigm ] ) one sums over two distinct components .",
    "in fact , @xmath296 is nothing but the relative interference strength , called @xmath297  @xcite , between @xmath298 and @xmath299 decay amplitudes induced by mixing .",
    "since weak interaction is left - handed , the right - handed effect from the sm is always accompanied with mass suppression factor .",
    "hence , @xmath300 , and @xmath301 and @xmath302 also vanish within sm .",
    "we illustrate these quantities in figs .",
    "[ fig : phigm](b)-(e ) within our scenario .",
    "our results for @xmath51 are clearly rather different from the _ zero _ value predicted by sm .",
    "they can be profitably studied , again if fast @xmath303 mixing can be overcome .",
    "note that @xmath302 , which can in principle be measured without tagging and vertexing , is not far from zero for @xmath51 hence not a good discriminant .",
    "a hint for new physics has emerged in mixing dependent cp violation asymmetry in @xmath304 decay , which seem to be of opposite sign to @xmath305 .",
    "it is important to cross check in @xmath1 system .    in an explicit model that combines susy and abelian flavor symmetry ,",
    "one has maximal @xmath27-@xmath28 squark mixing , with one new associated cp violating phase @xmath26 .",
    "the maximal mixing could generate one light and flavor mixed @xmath23 squark , which could impact on @xmath306 transitions .",
    "the current experimental results , @xmath0 while @xmath307 , seem to suggest @xmath51 with @xmath308 tev and @xmath309 tev .",
    "studies of mixing - dependent cp asymmetry @xmath56 in @xmath1 system in as many modes @xmath53 , is of great interest to test the model .",
    "however , it would be challenging because of very rapid @xmath1 oscillations implied by the sizable new physics effect in @xmath0 .",
    "an alternative approach is to use untagged data to complement the studies of cp violation in @xmath1 system .",
    "this is feasible if @xmath79 is as large as @xmath80 , allowing one to study cp violating asymmetry in rate , @xmath197 .",
    "thus , it is worthy to investigate cp asymmetries @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the @xmath1 system .",
    "we have illustrated such a study for @xmath1 system that could search for new physics effects and assist the determination of model parameters .",
    "we gave the results for @xmath310 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we stress that @xmath56 , @xmath197 and @xmath252 ( shift in @xmath139 in specific cp eigenmode relative to @xmath311 ) have good potential to help pin down the model parameters .",
    "however , the measurement of these quantities may sometimes be challenging because of fast @xmath1 oscillations .",
    "we also emphasize that , the mechanism that utilizes _ wrong helicity photon _ in @xmath312 decay allows one to study cp violation without hadronic effects that plague the charmless hadronic modes such as @xmath313 .",
