    "state determination for a physical system hinges on being able to non - invasively measure its relevant parameters . however , a measurement performed on a quantum system is by definition invasive , and hence quantum state estimation relies on measurements made on an ensemble of identically prepared systems .",
    "quantum state estimation process is thus intrinsically statistical in nature , with its accompanying ambiguities and uncertainties .",
    "there is no direct measurement possible for the quantum state of a single system and for the estimation of a state , we are required to determine the expectation values of a set of incompatible observables .",
    "the accuracy of such a determination depends upon the size of the ensemble and ideally we need an infinite size ensemble to obtain the precise values of these expectations . however , if we are given a small ensemble with a fixed number of identically prepared states , how can we effectively extract information from it ?",
    "the wave function collapse associated with projective measurements limits us from using each member of the ensemble more than once .",
    "the problem of state estimation has been investigated by physicists since the inception of quantum information theory  @xcite .",
    "apart from the direct use of projective measurements , there exist other methods of state tomography which try to extract information from a system in different ways .",
    "some prescriptions use the information gained about the system from one measurement to decide on the next measurement  @xcite .",
    "others employ maximum likelihood technique and numerical optimization  @xcite , or use repeated weak measurements on a single system  @xcite , to maximize the information gain . weak or unsharp measurements potentially hold promise for state estimation because of their non - invasiveness which allows state recycling . on the one hand",
    "the disturbance caused by a weak measurement is less , however on the other hand it also gives us limited information .",
    "the challenge therefore is to find a balance i.e. an intermediate regime of weakness , which leads to optimal information gain .",
    "the idea has been explored recently in the context of a qubit with a small ensemble size  @xcite .",
    "weak measurements coupled with postselection have also been employed in the problem of state estimation where a complete characterization of the postselected quantum statistics  @xcite or the direct measurement of the quantum wavefunction is used  @xcite .",
    "state measurement schemes based on weak measurement tomography have also been recently proposed  @xcite .",
    "there have also been critial analysis of these schemes  @xcite .    for continuous variable systems , quasi - probability distributions including the wigner distributions",
    "can be tomographed by measuring the rotated quadrature components  @xcite .",
    "there are homodyne and heterodyne schemes for estimation of squeezed gaussian states  @xcite and squeezed thermal gaussian states  @xcite .",
    "schemes using a single photon detector instead of a homodyne detector to characterize gaussian states have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "the possible advantage offered by an entangled gaussian probe to estimate the displacement of a continuous variable state has also been explored  @xcite .",
    "the importance of maximum likelihood methods has been emphasized  @xcite and state reconstruction has been described  @xcite . in a different direction , arthurs and kelly aimed to simultaneously measure position and momentum of a general wavefunction by coupling two different apparatuses with the system  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath0 and @xmath1 are noncommuting observables , this leads to an unsharp measurement .",
    "symplectic tomography has been used to estimate the master equation parameters in an open setting for a single mode system  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can reuse each member of the ensemble if the first measurement is done weakly enough such that the disturbance induced is very small  @xcite .",
    "a similar idea has been utilized , albeit in a different direction , in the construction of loophole free hybrid bell - leggett- garg inequalities  @xcite .",
    "weak or unsharp measurements are performed by weakly coupling the device to the quantum system  @xcite .",
    "although the noise produced in such measurements is small , which should serve our purpose well , the information obtained is also very low .",
    "therefore , there is a tradeoff between the disturbance and information gain . to effectively use weak measurements for state estimation , we need to optimize the process .    in this work",
    "we restrict ourselves to the realm of a special class of states of one continuous variable quantum systems called gaussian states .",
    "these are states with gaussian - wigner quasiprobability distributions and include coherent states , squeezed states and thermal squeezed states .",
    "the gaussian states are determined by the first and second moments of position and momentum .",
    "we explore the advantage of the scheme involving weak measurements in estimating the gaussian states over projective measurements .",
    "we show that with an optimal strength of the weak measurement , our technique is more powerful in the determination of the wigner quasiprobability distribution when the ensemble size available is small .",
    "we have chosen the meter state in the form of a minimum uncertainty squeezed gaussian state and the tuning of the weakness of a measurement is achieved by changing the squeezing of the position quadrature .",
    "this scheme is tested for average performance over a large number of states and over a large number of runs to kill statistical fluctuations .",
    "we also take gaussian states at different temperatures and check whether the efficacy of our method depends in any way on temperature .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : in section  [ tools ] we collate all the background material necessary for the problem .",
    "we describe continuous variable states and wigner s quasiprobability distributions in brief .",
    "symplectic methods are described briefly .",

    "in this case the distance measures @xmath102 and @xmath103 have been plotted with @xmath119 for an absolute temperature given by @xmath40 and ensemble size @xmath96 .",

    "a very weak measurement introduces a large amount of error in the measurement and this leads to a low quality of state estimation .",

    "the corresponding measurement limit for this side of the plot is that of strong projective measurements .",
    "projective measurements destroy the state of the system and hence using the state for the second time leads to a low quality of state estimation .",

    "the plot of @xmath103 attains its minimum for the intermediate values of @xmath119 but remains above the dotted line .",
    "it indicates that though our method has worked in giving a better estimation of the position of the gaussian state , it does not perform as well to provide an estimation of the spreads of the gaussian , in this particular case .",

    "we observe the same trend as observed for the zero temperature in all these cases .",
    "our method is not too effective in the extremely weak or extremely strong regimes .",

    ", it is observed that the distance measures attain small values for an optimal value of squeezing .",
    "this is expected , as a very large value of squeezing ushers in too many errors into the `` weak measurement '' , while a small value causes a larger disturbance to the original state .",
    "we observe from figures  [ k_1 ] ,  [ k_0.9 ] and  [ k_0.8 ] that for an optimal range of @xmath111 values , the weak distance measure curves go below the projective measurement line ( represented by broken straight lines ) . in this regime of @xmath111 values ,",
    "our method is more effective than the projective measurement state estimation . the advantage is greater for smaller ensemble size .",
    "in fact for the ensemble size of @xmath96 and @xmath40 , the performances of the optimal weak measurement method and projective measurement are almost equal as can be seen in figure  [ k_1 ] .",
    "however , as the ensemble size decreases , a clear advantage emerges for the proposed scheme .",

    "we use phase space methods and the language of wigner distributions for state estimation .",
    "we compare our results with state estimation based on projective measurements and show how one can do better in certain parameter regimes .",
    "recycling of states , where one makes more than one measurement on a single copy before discarding it and tenability of the strength of the weak measurement are the two main ingredients of our scheme .",
    "the strength of the measurement is directly related to the amount of squeezing in the initial pointer state and can be tuned at will and we optimize the performance of our scheme with respect to this weakness parameter .",

    "we demonstrate that the weak measurement based scheme produces a wigner distribution which is much closer to the original wigner distribution as compared to the scheme based on projective measurements , for small ensemble sizes . as the ensemble size increases , the relative advantage of our scheme decreases , as seen in the comparative results for varying ensemble sizes .",
