    "<S> quantum entanglement is the quintessential characteristic of quantum mechanics and the basis for quantum information processing . </S>",
    "<S> when one of two maximally entangled particles is measured , without measurement the state of another one is determined simultaneously no matter how far the two particles is from each other . how can these phenomena take place since no object can move faster than light speed in a vacuum ? </S>",

    "<S> the quantum vacuum is not only the origin of all possible kinds of particles , but also the origin and the core of eastern mystics .    in spite of its unprecedented success in description of nature </S>",
    "<S> , quantum theory remains mysterious . </S>",
    "<S> even great physicist like feynman , who presented a new formulation of quantum mechanics , at one time said that nobody understands quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> this statement becomes clear when one realized that quantum theory is based on a number of very counterintuitive concepts and notions and many questions such as those about the nature of the external world and the meaning of an objective physical reality remain open . </S>",
    "<S> classical physics impresses us many deep - seated concepts such as realism according to which an external reality exists independent of observation and locality which means that local events can not be affected by actions in space - like separated regions @xcite . based on these deep - rooted reasonable assumptions , in 1935 , einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) originated the famous  epr paradox \" . </S>",
    "<S> the epr paper spurred intensive investigations into the nonlocality of quantum physics . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the epr paradox brought into sharp focus the concept of entanglement , now considered to be the cornerstone of quantum information process.@xcite . since 1964 the epr arguments about the physical reality of quantum systems is shifted from the realm of philosophy to the domain of experimental physics when bell and others constructed mathematical inequalities - one of the profound scientific discoveries of the 20th century @xcite , which must be satisfied by any theory based on the joint assumption of realism and locality and may be violated by quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> many experiments @xcite have since been done that are consistent with quantum mechanics and inconsistent with local realism . </S>",
    "<S> all of the present experimental evidence leads to the conclusion that quantum correlations take place instantaneously and nature is nonlocal@xcite . then there arises a big question : why quantum correlations happen instantaneously as if the space collapses for two entangled particles at a far distance ?    here </S>",
    "<S> i show that two entangled particles can interact distance - independently through in the quantum vacuum ( qv ) the shadows which accompany the generation of the particle and change with the particle states . </S>",
    "<S> quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum swap @xcite , and wave function collapse can be explained in a similar way . </S>",
    "<S> a quantum object is interpreted as a composite consisting of two inseparable components - a particle and the shadowed qv which is responsible for wave characteristic of the so - called particle wave duality . </S>",

    "<S> when a particle is created from a qv , the qv is in some sense  broken \" , which can be described by a shadow state in the qv . </S>",
    "<S> the shadow state and the particle state have an one - to - one mapping ; the shadow state changes correspondingly with the particle state . </S>",
    "<S> the qv is the physical reality containing all possible kinds of quantum fields which are all in vacuum states . </S>",
    "<S> any quantum object is the composite of two inseparate components , a particle and the shadowed qv . </S>",
    "<S> it is the qv that makes a quantum object have a wave nature.,width=302 ]    first we discuss a boson - type quantum field . </S>",
    "<S> a boson of momentum @xmath0 can be created from a qv [ eq1 ] _ * p*_j = a(*p*_j)^ where @xmath1 denotes the creation operator ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the qv is the physical reality comprising of all possible quantum fields which are all in the vacuum states . </S>",
    "<S> this equation can be rewritten as follows [ eq17 ] _ * p*_j&&_*p*_j^qv = a(*p*_j)^ + & = & _ * p*_j + & & _ * p*_j where the superscript @xmath2 denotes the state of the system comprising a particle , the qv and the corresponding shadow in the qv , @xmath3 describes the absence of the vacuum state @xmath4 , @xmath5 denotes the qv state and @xmath6 named the shadow state of @xmath7 in the quantum vacuum describes the effect of the creation of a particle with momentum @xmath0 on the vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the physical meaning of eq . </S>",
    "<S> is obvious : when a particle of momentum @xmath0 is created from the qv , the qv changes correspondingly by leaving the quantum vacuum mode @xmath4 absent - the qv is somewhat  broken \" , in the similar way as a hole will appear in a valence band when an electron is excited from the valence band to a conduction band . </S>",
    "<S> thus the generation of any particle from the qv will leave in the qv a  hole \" named a shadow and any quantum state will have a corresponding shadow state in the qv . </S>",
    "<S> how can we expect that there is nt any effect on the qv when a particle is created from the body of the qv and evolves in the body of the qv ? </S>",
    "<S> it is very regretable that so far we have all through neglected this crucial effect . here </S>",
    "<S> this effect is considered and described by the shadow of a particle and the shadow state of a particle state .    from equation </S>",
    "<S> we see that the generation of a particle of momentum @xmath8 from the qv will leave a corresponding shadow state in the qv . </S>",
    "<S> it is natural that the generation of @xmath9 particles with momentum @xmath8 will leave a corresponding shadow state in the qv too . </S>",
    "<S> to describe this situation , i introduce a shadow operator @xmath10 which acts on the shadow state , then eq . </S>",
    "<S> can be rewritten as [ eq18 ] _ * p*_j^qv = a(*p*_j)^|a(*p*_j)^_*p*_j the action of annihilation operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 on the qv is written as [ eq19 ] a(*p*_j)|a(*p*_j)=0 , which has stressed the fact that the qv ca nt be eliminated . </S>",
    "<S> since any quantum state always accompanies its shadow state , the annihilation operator @xmath11 and @xmath12 or the creation operation @xmath13 and @xmath14 should always appear together . </S>",
    "<S> any operator and its shadow operator are commutable with each other ; the shadow operators obey the same commute relations as the corresponding operators .    </S>",
    "<S> we can express the combination of the operators @xmath15 by @xmath16 , [ eq20 ] b(*p*)^=_*p*_j and [ eq35 ] b(*p*)^_*p*_j=_*p*_j . </S>",

    "<S> the commutation relations have to be replaced by anticommutation relations .    in the heisenberg picture , any operator @xmath17 </S>",

    "<S> the field operator is expanded as follows [ eq29 ] ( * x*,t)=b_pe^i*p*-it . @xmath22 acting on the qv [ eq23 ] = ( * x*,t)^ creates a particle of mass @xmath18 at position @xmath19 and a corresponding shadow in the qv . </S>",
    "<S> wave function is defined as [ eq24 ] ( * x*,t)||(*x*,t)&=&*x*,t + & & ( n_1+n_2+=1 ) , where the notation @xmath23 stresses the fact that @xmath24 is the shadow state of @xmath25 and [ eq26 ] = ( b^(*p*_2))^n_1(b^(*p*_1))^n_2 . </S>",
    "<S> if a particle of mass @xmath18 is subject to an external field @xmath26 , the corresponding hamiltonian has the form [ eq27 ] h = d^3x . </S>",
    "<S> according to the heisenberg equation of motion eq . , we have @xcite [ eq30 ] i(*x*,t)=(-^2+v(*x*))(*x*,t ) . from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq23],[eq24],[eq30 ] ) , we obtain [ eq31 ] i(*x*,t)||(*x*,t)=(-^2+v(*x*))(*x*,t)||(*x*,t ) . this equation just tell us that the wave function @xmath25 obeys the schrdinger equation [ eq32 ] i(*x*,t)=(-^2+v(*x*))(*x*,t ) while the shadow wave function @xmath27 obeys the same equation of motion as @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> thus any quantum state @xmath28 should have a corresponding shadow state @xmath29 in the qv , leading to the quantum object should be described by @xmath30 . for any superposition state @xmath31 , the corresponding particle - vacuum state should be written by [ eq2 ] ^qv&=&_i c_i_i c_i + & & _ ic_i()_ic_i where @xmath32 is a coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> this equation can be easily obtained from the fact that the @xmath33 is always the shadow of the state @xmath34 . to simplify notations , </S>",
    "<S> i apply the last expression in eq .. from this equation , we can see that the particle - vacuum system ca nt be seen as an ordinary system comprising two particles . </S>",
    "<S> considering there exist many different kinds of fields , the qv should be described by [ eq5 ] & = & + & & where @xmath35 represent the quantum numbers other than momentum @xmath8 .    </S>",

    "<S> when a readout of spin 1 is performed with a result @xmath36 , the shadow state in the qv becomes @xmath37 , which shows that the state of spin 2 is @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the determination of the state of particle 1 , the shadow state , and that of particle 2 is taken place simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between particle 1,2 based on the qv through the shadow state is well described in the fock space ( eq . ) and is independent of the distance between the two particles . </S>",
    "<S> if the interaction is described in the point of view of the coordinate space , the interaction takes place with an infinity speed , or the distance between the particles is taken as zero , as if the space collapses in the qv . </S>",
    "<S> this explain of the nonlocal characteristic of the entanglement is very natural , because the qv exists everywhere , and the two particles exist in the qv , once more i stress that the qv - based influence between the two particles takes place without any time - ordering , which is in consistent with the results in literatures @xcite .    as a contrast </S>",

    "<S> alice tells bob his measurement result through a classic channel , then bob carries out a corresponding unitary transform on particle 3 leaving it in state @xmath51 . </S>",

    "<S> we can see that quantum swap is also performed under the help of the qv and the shadow states in the qv .    </S>",

    "<S> the unintelligibility of the quantum theory is mainly due to the indescribability with the coordinate space of the qv which , in my point of view , is the deepest mystery in nature . </S>",
    "<S> the qv has infinity energy and infinity potential to generate infinity particles . </S>",
    "<S> but we ca nt see it or detect it directly . </S>",
    "<S> the qv is the strongest physical reality since nothing can destroy it even the so - called big bang , at the same time it is the weakest reality because even the smallest particle can move in it without any obstacle from it . </S>",
    "<S> it exists all over the coordinate space , at the same time considering the fact that quantum correlations take place without any time - ordering , it should be considered to be a non - spatial domain where there is no distance and as if the space collapses - it is the largest reality in the world because every object is in his body while it is the smallest reality in the world considering that there is no spatial structure in the qv . in this way we can find numerous contradiction in terms to describe the qv .    </S>",
    "<S> any quantum object has the so - called wave particle duality . in the neutron double - slit experiments the intensity of the neutron sources is so low that while one neutron is being recorded , the next one to be recorded is still confined to the neutron source , leading to the conclusion that the interference fringe is really collected one by one , which shows the particle nature @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> why does a single particle have wave characteristic ? </S>",
    "<S> since any particle is created from the qv which is nonlocal and has the characteristic of superposition , at the same time leaving the qv broken with a shadow , which leads to the fact that any particle is inseparable from the qv , it is very reasonable to ascribe the wave nature of any quantum object to the shadowed qv . </S>",
    "<S> thus the quantum object can be taken as a system comprising two inseparable parts - a particle and the shadowed qv , and its state is perfectly described by a wave function which obeys the well - known equations . </S>",
    "<S> bearing this picture in mind , we will not be astounded by the recent experimental advances @xcite which show that certain features of realistic descriptions must be abandoned and  </S>",
    "<S> one should not have any realistic pictures in one s mind when considering a quantum phenomenon \" @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that any quantum object s inseparable part - the shadowed qv ca nt be described by any classical language which we are familiar with .    </S>",
    "<S> i have shown that any particle created from the qv leaves the qv with a corresponding shadow state in it . </S>",
    "<S> based on this discovery , quantum entanglement , quantum teleportation of unknown states , quantum entanglement swap , and wave function collapse in the coordinate can be easily understood . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between entangled particles is based on the shadowed qv , is distance - independent , and is instantaneous . </S>",
    "<S> i also depict the quantum object as the composite of two inseparate components , a particle and the shadowed qv which the wave nature of the quantum object is ascribed to . </S>",
    "<S> the qv is the origin of every particle and even our whole physical world . assuming the qv is the origin of the consciousness is a natural extend , then the whole cosmos is created from the qv . </S>",
    "<S> many scientists such as n. bohr , w. heisenberg , and r. oppenheimer have realized the close relationship between the modern physics and eastern mysticism :  here the parallels between modern physics and eastern mysticism are most striking , and we shall often encounter statements where it is almost impossible to say whether they have been made by physicists or by eastern mystics \" @xcite . now it is clear that this phenomena taken place is due to the fact that the qv is also the origin and the core of eastern mysticism , in other words , the qv is the body of buddha and the tao which is thought to be the origin of our world . </S>",
    "<S> several hundreds years ago , science said good - bye to religions , today science has arrived at the same destination , the quantum vacuum , as that many religions had already reached in a different way . </S>"
