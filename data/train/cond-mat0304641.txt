    "one  dimensional ( 1d ) magnetic systems exhibit a variety of interesting phenomena signifying their quantum many  body nature .",
    "they have been , therefore , the subject of intense theoretical and experimental study . a great number of spin chain models has been proposed and investigated , with various interaction ranges , spin representations and anisotropies , as well as with coupling to other degrees of freedom .",
    "the nearest neighbor spin - 1/2 heisenberg model , in particular , plays an important role being exactly integrable@xcite , allowing a detailed analysis of its thermodynamic properties @xcite .",
    "these properties are found to be generic : they do not differ essentially from low energy properties of other ( non integrable ) short - range spin chains . on the other hand",
    ", the heisenberg model does not provide a generic description of transport properties .",
    "integrability entails the existence of an infinite number of conservation laws , which in turn imply a dissipationless transport@xcite of the elementary excitations ( spin-@xmath0 quantum solitons commonly named spinons ) even at _ finite _ temperatures , @xmath9 . as a result",
    ", measurable dc - transport coefficients such as electric and thermal conductivities are expected to be infinite . in realistic systems described by spin chains , e.g. materials consisting of weakly coupled chains ( or quasi1d structures ) of magnetically interacting ions ,",
    "the conservation laws of the ideal model are partially violated , and the transport coefficients become finite . if the violation is soft one may expect an unusually high thermal conductivity in such systems attributed to spinon transport . indeed , an experimental investigation of heat transport in materials of the ( sr , ca , la)cuo series have found a considerable enhancement of the thermal conductivity in the direction parallel to the chains @xcite .",
    "other types of systems involving quasi1d , antiferromagnetic spin-@xmath0 chains such as organic compounds @xcite are in principle accessible to such measurements , however at this point not much data is available @xcite .",
    "heat conductivity by magnetic excitations has also been observed , for example , in the spin - peierls compound@xcite cugeo@xmath10 or in ladder systems@xcite .    in a recent experimental study of srcuo compounds @xcite , sologubenko _ et al .",
    "_ report and analyze specific heat and thermal conductivity data .",
    "the excess thermal conductivity ( @xmath11 ) along the chains direction ( obtained after subtracting the phonon contribution ) is identified as a contribution of the spinons , and its dependence on the temperature @xmath12 is fitted to an empirical formula , designed to account for scattering of the spinons by localized defects as well as umklapp processes .",
    "a phonon umklapp mechanisms is suggested as an interpretation of the exponential factor @xmath13 $ ] which describes @xmath14 in the range of temperatures @xmath15 k @xmath16 k , with a characteristic temperature scale @xmath17 k close to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the debye temperature .",
    "however , this interpretation leaves open some questions : as the system is at zero magnetic field ( corresponding , in fermionic language , to half filling ) what inhibits the heat current relaxation to proceed by low - energy spinon ",
    "spinon umklapp scattering which is not exponentially suppressed ?",
    "why is not the relevant energy scale to the subleading relaxation processes the exchange interaction @xmath18 rather than @xmath19 k ?",
    "another interesting observation can be gleaned by conparing the plots of @xmath20 vs @xmath21 of the pure phonon contribution and of the spinon contribution @xcite .",
    "we note that the slope of the former is twice that of the latter .",
    "as pure phonon umklapp processes are goverened by @xmath22 , the fundamental reciprocal lattice momentum , we need to understand why it is @xmath23 that dominates the spinon processes .    we shall find that a rather subtle interplay of ( approximate ) conservation laws and quantum dynamics underlies the experimentally observed heat conductivity , and a sophisticated hydrodynamic field theoretic approach is necessary to fully account for it .",
    "the arguments are rather general@xcite : when a system possesses some conserved quantities @xmath24 these may `` protect '' the current @xmath5 from degrading ( this occurs when the cross - susceptibility @xmath25 ) leading to a pure drude peak and infinite d.c . conductivity .",
    "when the conservation of the pseudo - momenta @xmath24 is _ softly _ violated they will , instead , lead to very long time tails in the decay of the current @xmath5 , since states with a finite pseudo - momentum @xmath24 typically carry also a finite current @xmath5 ( when @xmath25 ) .",
    "hence the component of the current `` parallel '' to @xmath24 , @xmath26 with @xmath27 , will therefore decay exponentially slowly .",
    "the presence of such approximately conserved quantities leads then to a natural hydrodynamic description of the system where a separation of fast and slowly decaying modes takes place and a consistent scheme of calculation of the slow mode conductivities can be carried out in terms of a matrix of decay rates of these modes .",
    "these features emerge when we study the transport properties of clean 1d spin chains in the framework of a generic model which accounts for the coupling between spin excitations and lattice phonons .",
    "the model is analyzed close to its fixed point hamiltonian - the luttinger liquid - and the thermal conductivity @xmath28 is evaluated at low but finite @xmath12 . in this regime",
    "the transport coefficients are dominated by the slow relaxation of certain approximately conserved currents due to irrelevant corrections to the fixed point hamiltonian .",
    "the most important correction terms of this sort , which are relatively efficient in degrading the conserved currents of the integrable luttinger model , are found to be associated with umklapp scattering terms . these include pure spinon as well as spinon ",
    "phonon scattering processes . in the absence of a magnetic field ,",
    "the latter class is shown to be dominant .",
    "our detailed calculation of @xmath28 originating from umklapp scattering of spinons by 3d phonons agrees with the experimental results of ref .  [ ] .",
    "in particular , it explains the origin of the exponential factor @xmath13 $ ] with @xmath29 .",
    "we then proceed to investigate the effects of a ( large ) external magnetic field @xmath6 .",
    "the induced magnetization and the corresponding change of the wave vector of the spinons strongly modifies the way how various umklapp processes relax the heat current .",
    "this leads to a fractal  like spiky behavior of @xmath30 when plotted as a function of magnetization at fixed @xmath12 , where the spikes occur at specific commensurate values of the magnetization .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic field induces a _ linear _ spinon  phonon coupling tunable by @xmath6 .",
    "the coupling alters the nature of the fixed point : the elementary excitations of the system are _ composite spinon ",
    "phonon _ objects . as a consequence of this mixing ,",
    "the umklapp processes are also modified and the relevant energy scale @xmath31 ( again of the order of the minimum of @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) depends smoothly on @xmath6 .",
    "these effects are experimentally accessible in spin chains with relatively low magnetic exchange interaction @xmath5",
