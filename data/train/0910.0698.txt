    "optimally doped films of the high-@xmath0 superconductor yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( ybco ) grown by pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) show high critical currents that reach a substantial fraction of the theoretical maximum depairing current in applied magnetic field oriented in parallel to the @xmath6 axis@xcite .",

    "such increases in the in - field performance of the critical current in ybco films by columnar microstructures are very important to the development of second - generation high-@xmath0 superconducting wire technology .",

    "pinning of vortex lines will be assumed to be due to variations in @xmath0 about columnar defects that in turn are a result of the strain field about them@xcite .",
    "heterogeneous columnar defects are thereby predicted that are composed of component lines of pins and of antipins of equal strength@xcite@xcite . these form a dipolar `` clover - leaf '' pattern in the case of an edge dislocation line defect ( see fig .",

    "obtain the following central result : that the critical current due to an arrangnement of weak heterogeneous columnar pins is equal to that expected from an arrangement of conventional columnar pins@xcite obtained by unbinding the component pin / antipin lines from the heterogeneous cluster , and by then converting the isolated antipin lines that result into pin lines of equal strength .",
    "figure [ pin_landscapes ] depicts the two pinning landscapes in question .",
    "the antipin components of heterogeneous columnar defects therefore increase the critical current by a factor of two compared to the contribution due to the true pin components alone in the collective pinning regime .",
    "it is well known that the critical temperature in optimally doped ybco couples most strongly to pure shear strain in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane@xcite . in particular ,",
    "the variation in the critical temperature depends linearly on the symmetric strain tensor @xmath7 following @xmath8 with strain derivatives @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",

    "the potential energy landscape is essentially dipolar in such case , with two anti - pinning lobes ( + ) and two pinning lobes ( - ) .",
    "an analogous heterogeneous pinning potential for a vortex line about a nano - column inclusion has been obtained more recently by one of the authors in collaboration with barnes and varanasi@xcite . the lattice mismatch between the inclusion and the ybco matrix results in pure shear strain about the inclusion .",
    "these authors then ultimately find a variation of the critical temperature in the ybco matrix about the nano - column given by @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the mismatch between the radius of the inclusion , @xmath23 , and the radius of the corresponding void in the ybco matrix , @xmath24 , while @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the 2d compression and shear moduli , respectively .",

    "above , we have shown how the strain field about edge dislocations and nano - column inclusions that thread a ybco film along the @xmath6 axis result in heterogeneous pinning lines for vortex lines that are present in the mixed phase .",

    ". because the magnitude of the force experienced by the vortex lines that lie in the valleys and on the hills of the vortex - core potential are equal , the critical current should be the same as that due to a field of columnar pins which results from ( _ i _ ) unbinding the cluster of pins and antipins from the heterogeneous pins , and ( _ ii _ ) converting each of the antipins that are now isolated into pins of equal strength and range .",

    "last , study of equations ( [ disc ] ) and ( [ nano_rod ] ) shows that the potential energy about a heterogeneous pinning line experienced by a vortex line has zero angle average .",

    "observe now that both @xmath39 and the product @xmath47 remain constant after unbinding the pins and anti - pins that make up heterogeneous columnar defects , and after then converting the isolated antipins that result into isolated true pins ! we conclude that 2d collective pinning theory@xcite@xcite implies that the critical current due to comparable arrangements of conventional columnar pins and of heterogeneous columnar pins like those shown in fig .
