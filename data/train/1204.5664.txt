    "( [ sdd ] ) we see that for @xmath5 the sdd does not depend on the number of vertices whatever value @xmath3 takes .",

    "this dimensional analysis therefore suggests that while @xmath61 logarithmically diverges in qed@xmath13 it is finite in rqeds .",

    "scale invariance is for example lost in qed@xmath13 where the coupling constant diverges in the ultraviolet .",
    "this is encoded in the beta function of the theory which describes the dependence of the coupling constant on the energy scale : ( ( ) ) = , [ beta_def ] and @xmath62 for qed@xmath13 .",
    "the above dimensional analysis suggests that massless rqed@xmath46 , with @xmath63 , may remain scale invariant when radiative corrections are included with a possible anomalous scaling dimension for the fermion field .",

    "keeping the space - time dimensions of the fermion field , @xmath3 , and gauge - field , @xmath2 , arbitrary for the moment , we proceed on deriving the feynman rules of massless rqed@xmath0 .",

    "we will often omit the convergence factor in order to simplify notations but they are implied . because we are interested in the properties of the system in the reduced space where the fermion field is living we may integrate over the @xmath68 bulk gauge degrees of freedom .",

    "diverging feynman diagrams then appear as meromorphic functions in @xmath33 .",
    "subtracting divergences corresponds to subtracting poles in @xmath77 .",
    "this can be done by relating the bare fields and parameters of the theory to renormalized quantities as : = z_^1/2_r , = z_a^1/2 _ r , = z_a_r , e = z_^1/2e_r , [ ren_constants ] where @xmath78 is a reduced gauge field and @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are dimensionless renormalization constants .",
    "we shall be using an improved minimal subtraction scheme ( @xmath82 ) where these constants reduce to unity in a finite qft and take the form of laurent series in @xmath33 in the presence of divergences .",
    "moreover , in order to restore the canonical dimensions of the fields and parameters one needs to introduce a renormalization scale @xmath83 which has dimension of mass . in the @xmath82 scheme",
