    "attempts to geometrical unification of gravity with other interactions , using higher dimensions other than our conventional @xmath1 space  time , began shortly after invention of the special relativity ( * sr * ) .",
    "nordstrm was the first who built a unified theory on the base of extra dimensions  @xcite .",
    "tight connection between sr and electrodynamics , namely the lorentz transformation , led kaluza  @xcite and klein  @xcite to establish @xmath0 versions of general relativity ( * gr * ) in which electrodynamics rises from the extra fifth dimension . since then , considerable amount of works have been focused on this idea either using different mechanism for compactification of extra dimension or generalizing it to non  compact scenarios ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) such as brane  world theories  @xcite , space  time ",
    "matter or induced  matter ( * i m * ) theories  @xcite and references therein .",
    "the latter theories are based on the campbell  magaard theorem which asserts that any analytical @xmath6dimensional riemannian manifold can locally be embedded in an @xmath7dimensional ricci ",
    "flat riemannian manifold  @xcite .",
    "this theorem is of great importance for establishing @xmath1 field equations with matter sources locally to be embedded in @xmath0 field equations without _ priori _ introducing matter sources . indeed ,",
    "the matter sources of @xmath1 space  times can be viewed as a manifestation of extra dimensions .",
    "this is actually the core of i m theory which employs gr as the underlying theory .",
    "on the other hand , jordan  @xcite attempted to embed a curved @xmath1 space  time in a flat @xmath0 space  time and introduced a new kind of gravitational theory , known as the scalar ",
    "tensor theory .",
    "following his idea , brans and dicke  @xcite invented an attractive version of the scalar  tensor theory , an alternative to gr , in which the weak equivalence principle is saved and a non  minimally scalar field couples to curvature .",
    "the advantage of this theory is that it is more machian than gr , though mismatching with the solar system observations is claimed as its weakness  @xcite .",
    "however , the solar system constraint is a generic difficulty in the context of the scalar ",
    "tensor theories  @xcite , and it does  not necessarily denote that the evolution of the universe , at all scales , should be close to gr , in which there are some debates on its tests on cosmic scales  @xcite .    although it is sometimes desirable to have a higher dimensional energy ",
    "momentum tensor or a scalar field , for example in compactification of extra curved dimensions  @xcite , but the most preference of higher dimensional theories is to obtain macroscopic @xmath1 matter from pure geometry . in this approach ,",
    "some features of a @xmath0 vacuum brans  dicke ( * bd * ) theory based on the idea of i m theory have recently been demonstrated  @xcite , in where the role of gr as fundamental underlying theory has been replaced by the bd theory of gravitation .",
    "actually , it has been shown that @xmath0 vacuum bd equations , when reduced to four dimensions , lead to a modified version of the @xmath1 brans  dicke theory which includes an induced potential .",
    "whereas in the literature , in order to obtain accelerating universes , inclusion of such potentials has been considered in _",
    "priori _ by hand .",
    "a few applications and a @xmath8dimensional version of this approach have been performed  @xcite .",
    "though , in refs .",
    "@xcite , it has also been claimed that their procedure provides explicit definitions for the effective matter and induced potential . besides , some misleading statements and equations have been asserted in ref .",
    "@xcite , and hence we have re  derived the procedure in section @xmath9 .",
    "actually , the reduction procedure of a @xmath0 analogue of the bd theory , with matter content , on every hypersurface orthogonal to an extra cyclic dimension ( recovering a modified bd theory described by a 4metric coupled to two scalar fields ) has previously been performed in the literature  @xcite . however , the key point of i m theories are based on not introducing matter sources in @xmath0 space  times .",
    "in addition , recent measurements of anisotropies in the microwave background suggest that our ordinary @xmath1 universe should be spatially flat  @xcite , and the observations of type ia  supernovas indicate that the universe is in an accelerating expansion phase  @xcite .",
    "hence , the universe should mainly be filled with a dark energy or a quintessence which makes it to expand with acceleration  @xcite .",
    "then after an intensive amount of work has been performed in the literature to explain the acceleration of the universe .    in this work ,",
    "we explore the friedmann  robertson",
    " walker ( * frw * ) type cosmology of a @xmath0 vacuum bd theory and obtain solutions and related conditions .",
    "this model has extra terms , such as a scalar field and scale factor of fifth dimension , which make it capable to present accelerated universes beside decelerated ones . in the next section",
    ", we give a brief review of the induced modified bd theory from a @xmath0 vacuum space  time to rederive the induced energy ",
    "momentum tensor , as has been introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , for our purpose to employ the energy density and pressure . in section  @xmath10 , we consider a generalized frw metric in the @xmath0 space  time and specify frw cosmological equations and employ the weak energy condition ( * wec * ) to obtain the energy density and pressure conditions .",
    "then , we probe two special cases of a constant scale factor of the fifth dimension and a constant scalar field . in section",
    "@xmath11 , we proceed to exhibit that @xmath0 vacuum bd equations , employing the generalized frw metric , are equivalent , in general , to the corresponding vacuum @xmath1 ones .",
    "this equivalency can be viewed as the main point within this work which distinguishes it from refs .",
    "@xcite . in section",
    "@xmath12 , we find exact solutions for flat geometries and proceed to get solutions fulfilling the wec while being compatible with the recent observational measurements .",
    "we also provide a few tables and figures for a better view of acceptable range of parameters .",
    "finally , conclusions are presented in the last section .",
    "following the idea of i m theories  @xcite , one can replace gr by the bd theory of gravitation as the underlying theory  @xcite . for this purpose , the action of @xmath0 brans  dicke theory can analogously be written in the jordan frame as @xmath13=\\int\\sqrt{|{}^{_{(5)}}g| } \\left ( \\phi \\ ^{^{(5)}}\\!r-\\frac{\\omega}{\\phi}g^{_{ab}}\\phi_{,_{a}}\\phi_{,_{b}}+ 16\\pi l_{m } \\right ) d^{5}x\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath14 , the capital latin indices run from zero to four , @xmath15 is a positive scalar field that describes gravitational coupling in five dimensions , @xmath16 is @xmath0 ricci scalar , @xmath17 is the determinant of @xmath0 metric @xmath18 , @xmath19 represents the matter lagrangian and @xmath20 is a dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "the field equations obtained from action ( 1 ) are @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 is @xmath0 einstein tensor , @xmath25 is @xmath0 energy ",
    "momentum tensor , @xmath26 . also ,",
    "in order to have a non  ghost scalar field in the conformally related einstein frame , i.e. a field with a positive kinetic energy term in that frame , the bd coupling constant must be @xmath27  @xcite .    as explained in the introduction",
    ", we propose to consider a @xmath0 vacuum state , i.e. @xmath28 , where equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) read @xmath29 and ) for later on convenient . ]",
    "@xmath30 for cosmological purposes one usually restricts attention to @xmath0 metrics of the form , in local coordinates @xmath31 , @xmath32 where @xmath33 represents the fifth coordinate , the greek indices run from zero to three and @xmath34 .",
    "it should be noted that this ansatz is restrictive , but one limits oneself to it for reasons of simplicity . assuming the @xmath0 space ",
    "time is foliated by a family of hypersurfaces , @xmath35 , defined by fixed values of the fifth coordinate , then the metric intrinsic to every generic hypersurface , e.g. @xmath36 , can be obtained when restricting the line element ( [ 6 ] ) to displacements confined to it .",
    "thus , the induced metric on the hypersurface @xmath37 can have the form @xmath38 in such a way that the usual @xmath1 space  time metric , @xmath39 , can be recovered .",
    "hence , equation ( [ 4 ] ) on the hypersurface @xmath37 can be written as @xmath40,\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is an induced energy ",

    "such an identification has been claimed  @xcite to be valid depending on metric background and considering separable scalar fields .",
    "however , this definition is different from what has been used in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "reduction of equation ( [ 5 ] ) on the hypersurface @xmath37 gives @xmath46-\\frac{b_{,\\mu}}{b}\\phi^{,\\mu}\\ , , \\ ] ] which after manipulation resembles the other field equation of a modified bd theory in four dimensions with induced potential .",
    "the definition @xmath41 and equation ( [ freduction ] ) are all we need for our purpose in this work and an interested reader can consult refs .",
    "@xcite for further details .    in the next section",
    "we assume a generalized frw metric in a vacuum @xmath0 universe to find its cosmological implications .",
    "for a @xmath0 universe with an extra space  like dimension in addition to the three usual spatially homogenous and isotropic ones , metric ( [ 6 ] ) can be written as @xmath47+b^2(t , y)dy^2\\,,\\ ] ] that can be considered as a generalized frw solution .",
    "the scalar field @xmath15 and the scale factors @xmath48 and @xmath49 , in general , are functions of @xmath50 and @xmath33 . however , for simplicity and physical plausibility , we assume the extra dimension is cyclic , i.e. the hypersurface  orthogonal space  like is a killing vector field in the underlying @xmath0 space  time  @xcite .",
    "hence , all fields are functions of the cosmic time only , and definition ( [ 6.3 ] ) makes the induced potential vanishes . in this case",
    ", we will show that such a universe can have accelerating and decelerating solutions .",
    "note that , the functionality of the scale factor @xmath49 on @xmath33 , either can be eliminated by transforming to a new extra coordinate if @xmath49 is a separable function , and or makes no changes in the following equations if @xmath49 is the only field that depends on @xmath33 . besides , in the compactified extra dimension scenarios , all fields are fourier ",
    "expanded around @xmath51 , and henceforth one can have terms independent of @xmath33 to be observable , i.e. physics would thus be effectively independent of compactified fifth dimension  @xcite .",
    "considering metric ( [ 7 ] ) , equations ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) result in cosmological equations @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 and @xmath55 which are  not independent equations and where @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . by employing relation ( [ 6.4 ] )",
    ", one can interpret the right hand side of equations ( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) as energy density and pressure of the induced effective perfect fluid , i.e. @xmath59 and @xmath60 where @xmath61 or @xmath9 or @xmath10 without summation on it .",
    "the latter equality in ( [ 11.2 ] ) comes from equation ( [ 22 ] ) which will be derived in the next section .",
    "therefor , the equation of state is @xmath62    the usual matter in our universe has a positive energy density , this basically has been demanded by the wec , in which time  like observers must obtain positive energy densities . actually , the complete wec is  @xcite @xmath63 now , let us consider that the scale factor of the fifth dimension and the scalar field are  not constant values , i.e. @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "then , by applying conditions ( [ 11.3 ] ) into relations ( [ 11.1 ] ) and ( [ 11.2 ] ) , one gets @xmath66 or @xmath67 where we also have assumed expanding universes , i.e. @xmath68 . using conditions ( [ 11.4 ] ) and ( [ 11.5 ] ) in relation ( [ 11.6 ] ) gives @xmath69 or @xmath70 in where the effective dust matter can be achieved when @xmath71 goes to negative or positive infinity , respectively .    in section  @xmath12 , we explore characteristic of the corresponding universes for the above results .",
    "meanwhile , in the following , we consider two special cases of a constant scale factor of the fifth dimension and a constant scalar field .",
    "+   + * constant scale factor of fifth dimension * + when @xmath49 is a constant , equations ( [ 8])([11 ] ) reduce to @xmath72 these are exactly the ordinary vacuum bd equations in @xmath1 space  time , with @xmath73 , as expected",
    ". +   + * constant scalar field * + when @xmath15 is a constant , action ( [ 1 ] ) reduces to a @xmath0 einstein gravitational theory that has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite in general situation ( i.e. the extra dimension is  not cyclic ) . in this case ,",
    "equations ( [ 8])([11 ] ) become @xmath74 and , the usual frw equations are equipped with @xmath75 , which refers to a radiation  like dominated universe for any kind of geometry without a _ priori _ assumption that the scale factor of the fifth dimension is proportional to the inverse of the usual scale factor , i.e. @xmath76 .",
    "actually , the radiation  like result is expected . for where there is no dependency on the extra dimension , the usual four dimensional part of metric ( [ 7 ] ) and the third equation ( [ 15 ] ) give a wave equation for the scale factor of fifth dimension .",
    "hence , definitions ( [ 6.5 ] ) and ( [ 6.6 ] ) yield a traceless induced energy ",
    "momentum tensor , as mentioned in ref.@xcite .    exact solution of the second equation of ( [ 15 ] ) is @xmath77 substituting solution ( [ 19 ] ) into the first or third equation of ( [ 15 ] ) gives @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are constants of integration , and we have assumed that @xmath1 space  time has originated from a big bang .",
    "for a closed geometry , solution ( [ 19 ] ) admits @xmath81 and predicts a big crunch at @xmath82 for the usual spatial coordinates while the fifth dimension tends to infinite size and is always real , for the maximum value of the usual scale factor is @xmath83 .",
    "but , a flat geometry expands for ever and accepts @xmath81 .",
    "an open geometry also expands for ever and admits @xmath84 . in this case , @xmath85 results in @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "time evolution of scale factors correspond to closed , flat and open geometries have been illustrated in fig .",
    "@xmath88 with constant values of @xmath89 and @xmath90 as an example .    in the next two sections",
    ", we again consider a more general situation in which the scale factor of the fifth dimension and the scalar field are  not constants .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "analogous to the approach of i m theories , one can consider the bd gravity as the underlying theory .",
    "hence , extra geometrical terms , coming from the fifth dimension , are regarded as an induced  matter and induced potential .",
    "we have followed , with some corrections , the procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite for introducing the induced potential and have employed a generalized frw type solution for a @xmath0 vacuum bd theory .",
    "hence , the scalar field and scale factors of the @xmath0 metric can , in general , be functions of the cosmic time and the extra dimension .",
    "however , for simplicity , we have assumed the scalar field and scale factors to be only functions of the cosmic time , where this makes the induced potential , by its definition , vanishes .",
    "we then have revealed that in general situations , in which the scale factor of the fifth dimension and scalar field are  not constants , the @xmath0 equations , for any kind of geometry , admit a power ",
    "law relation between the scalar field and scale factor of the fifth dimension .",
    "hence , the procedure exhibits that @xmath0 vacuum frw  like equations are equivalent , in general , to the corresponding @xmath1 vacuum ones with the same spatial scale factor but a new ( or modified ) scalar field and a new coupling constant .",
    "this equivalency can be viewed as the distinguished point of this work from refs .",
    "indeed , through investigating the @xmath0 vacuum frw  like equations , we have shown that its equivalent @xmath1 vacuum equations admit accelerated scale factors , contrary to what one may have expected from a vacuum space  time .",
    "conclusions of the complete investigation of the induced @xmath1 equations are as follows .    following our investigations for cosmological implications",
    ", we have shown that for the special case of a constant scale factor of the fifth dimension , the @xmath0 vacuum frw  like equations reduce to the corresponding equations of the usual @xmath1 vacuum bd theory , as expected . in the special case of a constant scalar field",
    ", the action reduces to a @xmath0 einstein gravitational theory and the equations reduce to the usual frw equations with a typical radiation dominated universe .",
    "for this situation , we also have obtained dynamics of scale factors of the ordinary and extra dimensions for any kind of geometry without any _ priori _ assumption among them .",
    "solutions predict a limited life time for closed geometries and unlimited one for flat and open geometries .",
    "a typical time evolutions of scale factors correspond to closed , flat and open geometries have been illustrated in fig .",
    "@xmath88 .",
    "then , we have focused on spatially flat geometries and have obtained exact solutions of scale factors and scalar field .",
    "solutions are found to be in the form of power  law and exponential ones in the cosmic time .",
    "we also have employed the wec for the induced ",
    "matter of the @xmath1 modified bd gravity , that gives two conditions ( [ 49.1 ] ) and ( [ 49.2 ] ) .",
    "we then have pursued properties of these solutions and have indicated mathematically and physically acceptable ranges of them , and the results have been presented in a few tables and figures .",
    "all types of solutions fulfill the wecs in different ranges , where the exponential solutions are more restricted .",
    "the solutions fulfilling the wec ( [ 49.1 ] ) have negative pressures , but the figures illustrate that for the power ",
    "law results there are decelerating solutions beside accelerating ones .",
    "for this condition , both @xmath91 and @xmath92 decrease with the cosmic time , but the extra dimension grows .",
    "on the other hand , the solutions satisfying the wec ( [ 49.2 ] ) have positive pressures , where the power ",
    "law results accept accelerating solutions in addition to decelerating ones .",
    "for this condition , again decreasing energy density and pressure with the time can occur for some solutions , however all with shrinking extra dimension .",
    "the homogeneity between the extra dimension and the usual spatial dimensions , i.e. @xmath93 , can take place in the solutions , but for the power ",
    "law ones the wecs exclude it .    by considering non  ghost scalar fields and appealing the recent observational measurements ,",
    "the solutions have been more restricted .",
    "actually , we have illustrated that the accelerating power  law solutions , which satisfy the wec and have non  ghost scalar fields , are compatible with the recent observations in ranges @xmath3 for the bd coupling constant and @xmath4 for dependence of the fifth dimension scale factor with the usual scale factor .",
    "these ranges also fulfill the condition @xmath5 which prevents ghost scalar fields in the equivalent @xmath1 vacuum bd equations . incidentally , this range is more restricted than the one obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. @xmath94 , where the difference may have been caused by the distinct definition of the induced potential in two approaches of ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "however , we should remind that it has also been shown  @xcite that the wec , for @xmath0 space  times , requires @xmath95 , in which no other experimental evidences have been considered .",
