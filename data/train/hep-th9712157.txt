    "can be given an * anti - bracket * @xmath132 of degree @xmath133 which , remarkably , combines with the product we began with to produce a very strong analog of a gerstenhaber algebra ( see section 9 ) , although this was not recognized until quite recently .",

    "however , in general , we may not have @xmath165 since @xmath166 and @xmath167 are , in general , functions .",
    "batalin and vilkovisky prove that all is not lost :    @xmath168 can be further extended by terms of higher degree in the ghosts to @xmath3 so that @xmath169 and hence the corresponding @xmath170 will have square zero .",
    "with hindsight , we can see that the existence of these terms of higher order is guaranteed because the antifields and antighosts provide a resolution of the stationary ideal .",
    "the pattern of the proof is one standard in homological perturbation theory @xcite : if @xmath171 at least @xmath172 , so by the acyclicity of @xmath173 , there exists @xmath174 as desired .",
    "( see @xcite for details in the corresponding hamiltonian case . )",
    "we refer to this complex @xmath175 as the * batalin - vilkovisky  complex*. the differential @xmath176 is sometimes called the brst operator and its cohomology the brst cohomology .",
    "physicists tend to write @xmath177 where mathematicians would write @xmath178    what is the batalin - vilkovisky  complex computing , that is , what do the groups @xmath179 mean for @xmath180 ?",
    "given sufficient regularity conditions on the euler - lagrange equations @xmath181 , there is a nice geometric answer @xcite , again analogous to the hamiltonian case . the stationary surface @xmath65 is foliated by the gauge orbits of the gauge symmetries . the standard complex for the longitudinal cohomology , i.e.",
    "the de rham cohomology using all of @xmath66 but differential forms only along the leaves ( gauge orbits ) of the foliation is given by @xmath182 with the chevalley - eilenberg differential .",
    "in the regular case , the batalin - vilkovisky  complex has replaced @xmath183 by the koszul - tate resolution and @xmath100 by a corresponding resolution .",
    "in the presence of a fixed lagrangian with or without gauge symmetries , there are various ways of combining the with the bv approach .",
    "the simplest is to start with the usual and adjoin anti - fields , ghosts and anti - ghosts , etc .",
    ", just as we did to @xmath31 . the exterior derivative acts in the as before and trivially on the new variables .",
    "a more subtle way is to treat the new variables @xmath143 as true coordinates on a super - manifold @xmath184 with corresponding jet coordinates",
    ". then we would have the corresponding , meaning that we would have differentials @xmath185 etc . and corresponding contact forms .",
    "an intermediate alternative is to consider only @xmath82 and @xmath120 as super - coordinates and leave the ghosts as just chevalley - eilenberg generators for computing the equivariant cohomology for the appropriate lie algebra or @xmath3-algebra .",
    "this intermediate alternative should be compared with the techniques of rational ( or real ) homotopy theory ( which have also made an appearance in the physics literature , for example in vasiliev@xcite ) .",
    "there one would construct a ` model ' of @xmath186 of the form @xmath187 for a graded vector space @xmath188 determined essentially by the same process as the koszul - tate resolution for @xmath66 .",
    "question : does the complex @xmath189 give a real homtopy theory model for @xmath190 ?    to date , none of these alternatives have been completely fleshed out , though certain computations in the physics literature may allow for one or another of these interpretations @xcite .",
    "what is the significance of @xmath191 in our lagrangian context or , equivalently , of the * master equation * @xmath192 ?",
    "there are three answers : in higher homotopy algebra , in deformation theory and in mathematical physics .",
    "as henneaux has emphasized , all the structure of our problem - the noether identities , the gauge symmetries , the reducibilities , etc . - have all been encoded in @xmath170 .",
    "if we expand @xmath193 , where the subscript indicates the change in the ghost degree @xmath30 , the individual @xmath194 do not correspond to @xmath195 for any term @xmath196 in @xmath197 but do have the following graphical description in terms of the bigrading @xmath72 :    so that we see the bv - complex as a multi - complex .",
    "the differential @xmath148 gives us the koszul differential @xmath35 , while @xmath198 gives us the koszul - tate @xmath35 and part of @xmath199 looks like that of chevalley - eilenberg .",
    "that is , @xmath200 describes a ( not - necessarily - lie ) bracket . indeed ,",
    "if the structure functions for @xmath201 and @xmath202 are in fact constants , we could have exactly the chevalley - eilenberg cochain complex for a lie algebra with coefficients in a module ; in our case , the module is the koszul - tate resolution .",
    "but for structure functions , we need the terms of higher order .",
    "what is the significance of , for example , terms with one anti - field @xmath82 , one anti - ghost @xmath203 and three ghosts @xmath204 ? such terms describe a tri - linear @xmath205 $ ] on gauge symemtries and so on for multi - brackets of possibly arbitrary length .",
    "moreover , the graded commutativity of the underlying algebra of the bv - complex implies appropriate symmetry of these multi - brackets .",
    "it is here that i began to see the shadow of a * strong homotopy lie algebra ( sh lie algebra ) * or @xmath3 * algebra * @xcite .",

    "a graded lie algebra is a graded vector space @xmath210 with graded skew maps @xmath211 satisfying the jacobi identity with appropriate signs ; this can be encoded as a coderivation @xmath208 of degree @xmath133 on the graded commutative coalgebra @xmath212 on @xmath213 with @xmath209 ( where @xmath213 denotes the graded vector space obtained from@xmath206 by shifting the grading up by 1 ) .",
    "certain aspects of the algebra we are concerned with are much easier to handle after this shift and extension to the graded symmetric algebra .",
    "vasiliev has begun the study of higher spin interactions at this level @xcite . since the batalin - vilkovisky  algebra includes a coderivation @xmath214 on a graded commutative coalgebra , the condition that @xmath215 translates to include the following identities , which are the defining identities for an @xmath3-algebra @xcite : @xmath216 + \\sum_{i=1}^n   \\epsilon(i ) [ v_1 , \\dots , dv_i , \\dots , v_n ] \\nonumber\\\\ = \\sum _ { p+q = n+1 } \\sum _ { \\mbox{unshuffles } \\ \\sigma } \\epsilon ( \\sigma ) [ [ v_{i_1 } , \\dots , v_{i_p } ] , v_{j_1 } , \\dots , v_{j_{q}}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath217 is the sign picked up by taking @xmath53 through @xmath218 and , for the unshuffle @xmath219 with @xmath220 and @xmath221 , the sign @xmath222 is the sign picked up by the @xmath223 passing through the @xmath224 s during the unshuffle of @xmath225 , as usual in superalgebra .",
    "realized in the batalin - vilkovisky  complex , these defining identities tell us , for small values of @xmath45 , that @xmath226 is a graded derivation of the bracket , that the bracket may not satisfy the graded jacobi identity but that we do have ( with the appropriate signs ) @xmath227 , v_3 ] \\pm [ [ v_1 , v_3 ] , v_2 ] \\pm [ [ v_2 , v_3 ] , v_2 ] = \\hspace{1.7in}\\nonumber \\\\ \\hspace{.5in}- d[v_1 , v_2 , v_3 ] \\pm [ dv_1 , v_2 , v_3]\\pm[v_1 , dv_2 , v_3]\\pm [ v_1 , v_2 , dv_3].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i.e. the jacobi identity holds _ up to homotopy _ or , for closed forms , the jacobi identity holds modulo an exact term given by the tri - linear bracket .",
    "note that the identity is the jacobi identity if @xmath228 .",
    "although the other brackets are then not needed for the jacobi identity ( we have a strict graded lie algebra ) , the other brackets need not vanish and indeed such brackets occur in the homology of a dg lie algebra and are known as massey - lie brackets @xcite .",
    "( they are the lie analogs of the massey products first introduced in cohomology of topological spaces massey , massey - uehara . )    furthermore , the identity has content even if only for one @xmath45 is the @xmath45-linear bracket non - zero , all others vanishing .",
    "precisely that situation has recently been studied quite independently of my work and of each other by hanlon and wachs @xcite ( combinatorial algebraists ) , by gnedbaye @xcite ( of loday s school ) and by azcarraga and bueno @xcite ( physicists ) . on the other hand , this is not takhtajan s fundamental identity @xcite for the generalized nambu @xmath45-linear ` bracket ' .",

    "they then sketch the problem of finding higher order terms for the lagrangian , but do not carry out the full calculation .",
    "in fact , according to the folklore in the subject , a consistent theory for @xmath231 will require additional fields of arbitrarily high spin @xmath214 . for @xmath232 ,",

    ", we are deforming the pair consisting of the abelian lie algebra and the stationary surface while constraining the stationary surface to remain of lagrangian type .",

    "in contrast , krasilshchik @xcite considers deforming the stationary surface ( more generally , the diffiety ) without regard to gauge symmetries .",
    "deformation theory @xcite suggests the following attack : compute the primary obstructions and discover that all infinitesimals are obstructed .",
    "add additional fields to kill the obstructions and calculate that indeed additional fields of arbitrarily high spin @xmath214 are needed .",
    "whether such computations are feasible to all orders remains to be seen ; perhaps eventually they lie in cohomology groups which can be seen to vanish .",
    "in one memorable phrase , this would be ` doing string field theory the hard way'.    in contrast , zwiebach @xcite does indeed have a consistent closed string field theory ( csft ) , but produced in an entirely different way .",

    "so far our description of the anti - field , anti - bracket formalism has been in the context of deformations of ` classical ' lagrangians .",

    "<S> the following exposition is based in large part on work with glenn barnich ( itp , berlin and universit libre de bruxelles ) and tom lada and ron fulp of ncsu ( the non - commutative state university ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is closely related to several other talks at this conference .    </S>",
    "<S> i am particularly happy to see ` cohomological physics ' in the title of this conference . </S>",
    "<S> i first referred to cohomological physics in the context of anomalies in gauge theory , cf . </S>",
    "<S> my work with bonora , cotta - ramusino and rinaldi @xcite , more than a decade ago . </S>",
    "<S> ( some people thought that phrase was a bit much . ) </S>",
    "<S> the cohomology referred to there was that of differential forms ( the de rham complex ) . </S>",
    "<S> differential forms were implicit in physics at least as far back as gauss ( 1833 ) ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> his electro - magnetic definition of the linking number gauss ) , and more visibly in dirac s magnetic monopole ( 1931 ) @xcite , which lived in a @xmath0 bundle over @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic charge was given by the first chern number ; for magnetic charge @xmath2 , the monopole lived in the hopf bundle , introduced that same year by hopf @xcite , though it seems to have taken some decades for that coincidence to be recognized @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus were characteristic classes ( and by implication the cohomology of lie algebras and of lie groups ) secretly introduced into physics .    </S>",
    "<S> cohomological physics had a major breakthrough with the ` ghosts ' introduced by fadeev and popov @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these were incorporated into what came to be known as brst cohomology ( becchi - rouet - stora @xcite and , here in russia , tytutin @xcite ) and which was applied to a variety of problems in mathematical physics . </S>",
    "<S> there the ghosts were reinterpreted by stora @xcite and others in terms of the maurer - cartan forms in the case of a finite dimensional lie group and more generally as generators of the chevalley - eilenberg complex @xcite for lie algebra cohomology .    </S>",
    "<S> group theoretic cohomology had already appeared in the work of bargmann @xcite on extensions of the galilean , lorentz and de sitter groups .    although i was unaware of it at the time , deformation theory ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> gerstenhaber @xcite ) also provided a bridge between the kind of homotopy theory i was doing and mathematical physics via deformation quantization ( bayen , flato , fronsdal , lichnerowicz , sternheimer @xcite ) , though the cohomological aspects were of minor importance in that application originally .    </S>",
    "<S> what i did become aware of next , thanks to henneaux @xcite and browning and mcmullen @xcite , was the cohomological reduction of constrained poisson algebras , specifically the batalin - fradkin - vilkovisky approach @xcite , which extended brst by reinventing the koszul - tate resolution of the ideal of constraints and producing a synergistic combination of both kinds of cohomology . </S>",
    "<S> here it was that i saw the esential features of a strong homotopy lie algebra ( @xmath3-algebra ) .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , cohomology was the essence of the approach to variational problems ( vinogradov @xcite , tsujishita @xcite , anderson @xcite ) in which lagrangians and the euler - lagrange equations were central . </S>",
    "<S> here we already encounter cohomological physics in the guise of differential forms on the jet bundle . as i learned here at this conference </S>",
    "<S> , krasilshchik krasil has developed the relation of deformation theory to the approach . </S>",
    "<S> an essential feature is the rich algebraic structure of various generalizations of poisson brackets , including schouten , schouten - nijehnhuis , gerstenhaber and nijenhuis - richardson brackets .    the batalin - vilkovisky machinery for lagrangian field theory is often presented in terms of fields which are functions on some manifold or sections of some bundle ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> henneaux s talks at this conference ) . </S>",
    "<S> the alternative approach which i will adopt for this conference reworks the machinery using the jet bundle approach . for years </S>",
    "<S> i ve been tantalized by the idea of combining the bv machinery with the and had originally planned to talk on that here , but instead , with my coauthors ( barnich , fulp and lada ) , i have been concentrating on elaborating the bv approach to lagrangian field theory , especially the higher homotopy aspects . </S>",
    "<S> we work with this in terms of the euler - lagrange complex which occurs at the edges of the . </S>",
    "<S> i will make some remarks about the combination of the anti - field , anti - bracket machinery with the ; such a combination will be directly relevant in the context of constraints and/or symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> such a combination has already appeared in works of mccloud @xcite and barnich - henenaux @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> hopefully this will inspire more of you to follow this route in delving further into the .    </S>",
    "<S> thus we see a rather intricate interweaving of several kinds of cohomology being brought to bear on problems in physics . </S>",
    "<S> i will not try to describe the whole web , but rather will follow one strand with just a few comments as others intersect it . </S>",
    "<S> the batalin - vilkovisky approach @xcite to quantizing particle lagrangians and lagrangians of string field theory involves the rubric of anti - fields as well as ghosts and an ` anti - bracket ' , first introduced essentially by zinn - justin @xcite in another notation . </S>",
    "<S> a revisionist view of the batalin - vilkovisky machinery recognizes parts of it as a reconstruction of homological algebra @xcite with some powerful new ideas undreamt of in that discipline . </S>",
    "<S> the ` standard construction ' is the batalin - vilkovisky  complex , and again we see the signature of @xmath3-algebras .    </S>",
    "<S> the ` quantum ' batalin - vilkovisky master equation has the form of the maurer - cartan equation for a flat connection , while the ` classical ' version has the form of the integrability equation of deformation theory . just as the maurer - cartan equation makes sense in the context of lie algebra cohomology , so the batalin - vilkovisky  master equation has an interpretation in terms of @xmath3-algebras . </S>",
    "<S> particularly interesting examples are provided by zwiebach s closed string field theory @xcite and higher spin particles @xcite . </S>"
