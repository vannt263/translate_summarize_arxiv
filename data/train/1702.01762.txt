    "a surprising finding that has puzzled astrophysicists for the last forty years or so is that the masses of these black holes appear to be tightly linked to the global properties of their hosts , such as stellar mass or velocity dispersion , defined on scales up to a thousand times the sphere of influence of the central black hole .",
    "the origin of these correlations is still hotly debated , though there is general agreement that understanding this origin will shed light on the more general and still unsolved problem of the formation of galaxies .",

    "local galaxies hosting supermassive black holes , irrespective of their exact morphological type or the aperture within which the velocity dispersion is measured , typically present velocity dispersions that are substantially larger than those of a very large and unbiased sample from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) with similar stellar masses .",
    "one of the main reasons for this bias can be traced back to the observationally imposed requirement that the black - hole gravitational sphere of influence must be resolved for the black - hole mass to be reliably estimated . via dedicated monte carlo simulations and accurate analysis of the residuals around the observed black - hole scaling relations , @xcite found the velocity dispersion to be a more fundamental quantity than stellar mass or effective radius . indeed , the observed black - hole scaling relation involving the stellar mass was found to be much more biased than the one involving velocity dispersion ( up to an order of magnitude in normalisation ) , and its apparent tightness could be entirely ascribed to a selection effect .",
    "@xcite also suggested that a selection bias more prominent in stellar mass than in velocity dispersion may explain several discrepancies often reported in the literature , _",
    "i.e. _ the fact that the observed relation between black - hole and stellar mass predicts a local black - hole mass density two to three times higher than inferred from the relation between black - hole mass and velocity dispersion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite further extended the comparison between the set of local galaxies with dynamically measured black - hole masses and sdss galaxies .",
    "they found evidence that even the correlation between black - hole mass and srsic index , recently claimed to be even tighter than the one with velocity dispersion @xcite , is severely biased , with the correlation to velocity dispersion remaining more fundamental .",
    "the bias in the local scaling relations could also have profound implications for the background of gravitational waves expected from binary supermassive black holes , which could be a factor of a few lower than what current pulsar timing arrays can effectively detect @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to revisit the local scaling relations between the masses of supermassive black holes and host - galaxy properties , namely velocity dispersion and stellar mass , in the context of a comprehensive semi - analytic model of galaxy formation and evolution @xcite .",
    "this model also evolves supermassive black holes self - consistently from high - redshift `` seeds '' , and accounts for black - hole mergers and for the feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "after briefly reviewing the model in section  [ sec|model ] , we discuss ( sections [ sec : normalisation ] and [ sec : dispersion ] ) the slope , normalisation and scatter of the black - hole scaling relations with and without the aforementioned selection effect on the resolvability of the black - hole sphere of influence .",
    "in section [ sec : residuals ] we study the correlations between the residuals from fitted scaling relations , and show that they are useful for constraining theoretical models such as ours as well as the hydrodynamic cosmological simulation horizon - agn @xcite .",

    "initially grow via ( mainly ) gas accretion from a gas reservoir , which is in turn assumed to form at a rate proportional to the bulge star formation rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , the feeding of this reservoir and the ensuing black - hole accretion events typically happen after star formation bursts triggered by major galactic mergers and disc instabilities . in both their radiatively efficient ( `` quasar '' ) and inefficient ( `` radio '' ) accretion modes",
    ", the black holes also exert a feedback on the host galaxies , thus reducing their ( hot and cold ) gas content and quenching star formation .",
    "as discussed by a number of groups @xcite , agn feedback prescriptions such as these tend to induce a correlation between black hole mass and velocity dispersion of the bulge component .",
    "also accounted by the model is the black - hole growth via black - hole mergers , following the coalescence of the host galaxies .",
    "this mechanism becomes particularly important for high black - hole masses at recent epochs .",
    "we will now compare the predictions of our model with observations , focusing on the normalisation of the scaling relations and on the role played by selection biases ; the dispersion around the scaling relations ; and the correlations between the residuals of the data from the scaling relations .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig|scalingsmstar ] shows the relation between velocity dispersion and stellar mass for early - type galaxies in the sdss . here `",
    "early - type ' means that the probability of being elliptical or lenticular , @xmath7(e+s0 ) , according to the automatic morphological classification of @xcite , exceeds 0.8 .",
    "we restrict to this specific sdss subsample as velocity dispersions in late - type galaxies are not spatially resolved , though the correlation does not depend on the exact cut in @xmath7(e+s0 ) . for consistency with the data of @xcite to which we will compare ,",

    "the top panels of figure  [ fig|scalingslight ] suggest that the model predicts intrinsic scaling relations which lie slightly below the data , especially for @xmath27-@xmath10  ( top right ) , but which are broadly consistent with the intrinsic relations suggested by ( * ? ? ?",

    "] at the same time , the model substantially underpredicts the @xmath27-@xmath10  relation by up to an order of magnitude ( top right panel ) , suggesting that there is some internal inconsistency in the data . in other words , a model like ours ,",
    "tuned to faithfully match the local velocity dispersion - stellar mass and black - hole mass - velocity dispersion relations , tends to severely underpredict the @xmath27-@xmath10  relation .",
    "this is in line with the results of @xcite .",
    "calibrating the model to match the observed @xmath27-@xmath10  relation would instead overestimate the observed @xmath27-@xmath9  relation .",
    "such an overestimate has indeed been seen in two ( very different ) cosmological hydrodynamic simulations",
    "@xcite.-@xmath9  relation . however , their predictions for @xmath27  are larger than the observations even at large @xmath9  ( c.f .",
    "their figure  7 ) , while they are in good agreement with the @xmath27-@xmath10  relation . ]    when the selection effect on the sphere of influence of the black hole is applied to the model ( middle and bottom panels of figure  [ fig|scalingslight ] ) , the median normalisations of the predicted scaling relations increase ( especially for the @xmath27-@xmath10  relation ) , because a substantial fraction of low - mass black holes are excluded .",
    "this is because , for a given angular aperture , equation  [ eq|rinfl ] preferentially removes objects with the smallest gravitational spheres of influence ; these tend to be the lowest - mass black holes .",
    "therefore , this effect tends to select the `` upper end '' ( in black - hole mass ) of the intrinsic distributions shown in the top panels of figure  [ fig|scalingslight ] .",
    "this also induces an overall flattening of the scaling relations , which is again more obvious in the @xmath27-@xmath10  plane : selection hardly matters for the most massive galaxies , but it causes a factor @xmath29 increase in the median observed @xmath27  at lower masses .",
    "selection - biased models are flatter in the @xmath27-@xmath9  plane as well .",
    "km / s in the sample of @xcite .",
    "note however that other samples , such as that of @xcite , contain black holes with masses up to @xmath30 at @xmath31 km / s , which is in better agreement with our model . ]    we conclude that , to agree with resolution - biased observed scaling relations , models must predict intrinsic scaling relations that are significantly _ steeper _ than the observed relations .",
    "we have tried to obtain steeper intrinsic scaling relations in our model by changing the agn feedback , but we have found this to be insufficient to achieve better agreement with the data at low masses and velocity dispersions .",
    "in fact , the results and conclusions of this paper are robust to changes in the agn feedback strength as well as to changes in the black - hole accretion prescriptions .    figure  [ fig|scalingslight ] also clearly shows that in addition to changing the normalisation and slope , selection dramatically decreases the dispersion around the median relations , especially at lower masses . note that these `` corrections '' do not depend on the exact choice of @xmath21 , since they are present for both @xmath25 and @xmath32 .",
    "similar comments apply to figure  [ fig|scalingsetgs ] , which compares model - predicted galaxies with bulge - to - total ratios of @xmath33 with the e+s0 galaxies of @xcite , in the same format as figure  [ fig|scalingslight ] .",
    "the intrinsic distributions of the model - predicted galaxies ( top panels ) are narrower than in the full samples ( c.f .",
    "top panels of figure  [ fig|scalingslight ] ) , and the median scaling relations have higher normalisations , in better agreement with the data and in line with the findings of @xcite . although the selection effect is smaller for this specific subsample of galaxies , the model - predicted intrinsic @xmath27-@xmath9 relation is offset slightly above the data , while the predictions for the intrinsic @xmath27-@xmath10  relation are slightly below the data .",
    "the effect of including the selection bias on the resolvability of the black hole sphere of influence ( middle and bottom panels ) is less important than in figure  [ fig|scalingsetgs ] , because the small systems for which the sphere of influence is not resolvable tend to live in late - type galaxies in our semi - analytic model .",
    "nevertheless , the selection bias still tends to make the correlations higher in normalisation , slightly flatter , and slightly tighter .",
    "it is important to emphasise that , whatever the exact black - hole seeding recipe adopted in the model , the predicted local ( intrinsic ) scaling relations reported in figure  [ fig|scalingslight ] for all galaxy types show very large dispersions , especially for galaxy stellar masses @xmath34 , with a broad distribution up to two orders of magnitude or more in black hole mass at fixed stellar mass or velocity dispersion .",
    "this is because the model tends to retain a significant number of low - mass black holes , which did not accrete much gas along their history ( because they live in spirals or satellite galaxies ) and which therefore remain closer to their seed masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , for more massive galaxies the dispersion is smaller , with almost no galaxies with @xmath35 having black holes with @xmath36 .",
    "one interesting way to probe the existence of very low - mass black holes in relatively low - mass galaxies could be to compare with the scaling relations in active galaxies , which are not limited by the spatial resolution issues that heavily affect dynamical measurements of black holes . to this purpose ,",
    "figure  [ fig|scalingsreines ] compares the predictions of our model with the recent sample of 262 broad - line agns collected by @xcite . in more detail , the observations",
    "are represented by blue squares , while the lines represent the median , the 90% confidence region ( i.e. the 5th and 95th percentiles ) and the 99% confidence region ( i.e. the @xmath37th and @xmath38th ) of the ( model - predicted ) @xmath27-@xmath10  relation , by assuming a light black - hole seed scenario ( the heavy - seed scenario gives very similar results ) and considering only systems with bolometric luminosity @xmath39 ( roughly the minimum luminosity probed by * ? ? ?",
    "the model s distribution of active black holes has been built by randomly drawing eddington ratios from a schechter distribution that extends up to the eddington limit , in agreement with a number of observations @xcite .",
    "we have verified that our predicted luminosity function at @xmath40 , computed by assuming an average duty cycle of active black holes of 10% consistent with the results from local surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , agrees with the ( obscuration - corrected ) bolometric luminosity functions of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "first , let us note , as emphasised by @xcite , that a lower limit of @xmath41 should still allow black holes down to a mass of @xmath42 to be detected , at least if a non - negligible fraction of these black holes are still accreting at the eddington limit",
    ". such low mass black holes do not seem to exist in the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) sample ( and in our model , at least in sufficiently large numbers and with high enough eddington ratios to warrant detection ) . even assuming lower virial factors @xmath43 than those adopted by @xcite in deriving black hole masses from their measured fwhms , as suggested by some groups ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , would not alter these conclusions .",
    "second , it is clear that the observational sample lies , on average , below the model median predictions , which were tuned to reproduce the data on inactive local galaxies with a significantly higher normalisation . while the predicted 90% and 99% confidence regions for the active black - hole population encompass the data of @xcite , the model also predicts the existence of a large number of active higher - mass black holes ( above the median ) , which are not observed .",
    "therefore , either the sample of @xcite is biased toward low - luminosity active systems , or our model should be normalised to lower values by a factor @xmath44 .",
    "the large scatter in our model means that , if the normalisation is decreased , then our model would predict a large tail of very low - mass black holes . since these are not observed , this would have important consequences for constraining models of the seeds of the supermassive black - hole population . on the other hand ,",
    "decreasing the normalisation of the @xmath27-@xmath10  relation is by no means straightforward .",
    "while it could be achieved by decreasing black - hole accretion , this would imply a proportional reduction in agn luminosity , unless a higher radiative efficiency and/or duty cycle are also assumed .",
    "the present calibration of our model already predicts rather high radiative efficiencies / black - hole spins @xcite .",
    "duty cycles of active black holes could instead be constrained by comparing with independent agn clustering measurements ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we plan to explore some of these important interrelated issues in future work .",
    "we now compare our model s predictions for the _ residuals _ of the black hole - galaxy scaling relations to the data .",
    "such correlations are an efficient way of going beyond pairwise correlations between the variables themselves @xcite . for example",
    ", measurements of the @xmath27-@xmath9  and @xmath27-@xmath10  correlations alone do not provide insight about whether @xmath9  is more important than @xmath10  in determining @xmath27 .",
    "this is because the @xmath27-@xmath9  and @xmath27-@xmath10  correlations do not encode complete information about the joint distribution of @xmath27 , @xmath9  and @xmath10 .",
    "correlations between the residuals encode some of this extra information .    to this purpose ,",
    "the left and right hand panels of figure  [ fig|residuals ] show @xmath45 vs @xmath46 and @xmath47 vs @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the residual in the @xmath50 variable ( at fixed @xmath51 ) from the log - log - linear fit of @xmath52 vs @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath53 . the purple long - dashed and dotted lines in each panel show the best fit and 1@xmath9 uncertainties on the correlations between residuals in the @xcite dataset : red circles and green triangles represent ellipticals and lenticulars .",
    "we obtained the purple lines by running 200 iterations following the steps outlined in @xcite , which include errors in both variables . at each iteration",
    "we eliminate three random objects from the original sample . from the full ensemble of realizations",
    ", we measure the mean slope and its 1@xmath9 uncertainty .",
    "the blue solid and dotted lines show a similar analysis in our semi - analytic model .",
    "however , in this case , we randomly produce 30 mock samples of @xmath54 galaxies each , with @xmath33 and resolvable black - hole spheres of influence . from the full ensemble of mock realizations ,",
    "we then extract the mean slope and pearson coefficient .",
    "the correlations in figure  [ fig|residuals ] show that , in the data , the velocity dispersion is more strongly correlated with the black - hole mass , with a mean pearson coefficient of @xmath55 , than stellar mass , for which the pearson coefficient is @xmath56 .",
    "the model instead predicts just the opposite , with almost zero correlation with velocity dispersion ( mean @xmath57 ) , but with a correlation with stellar mass consistent with the data , though still rather weak ( mean @xmath58 ) .",
    "it is nevertheless important to realise that even an intrinsically weak correlation with velocity dispersion at fixed stellar mass does not necessarily imply that the _ total _ correlation with velocity dispersion is small .",
    "in fact , following appendix b in @xcite , the total dependence of the black - hole mass on velocity dispersion can be summarised as @xmath59 , where @xmath60 comes from @xmath61 ( where we have ignored any other explicit dependence on , e.g. , srsic index or galaxy size ) . since the model predicts @xmath62 , and the residuals in figure  [ fig|residuals ] ( solid blue lines ) yield @xmath63 and @xmath64 , one obtains a total dependence of @xmath65 , consistent with figure  [ fig|scalingsetgs ] ( middle left panel ) .",
    "also note that a slope @xmath62 for the @xmath10-@xmath9  relation is in itself already in tension with the ( @xmath66-corrected ) sdss observations , which rather prefer a slope @xmath672.5 , at least for @xmath68 ( c.f . also figure  [ fig|gamma_horizon ] below ) .    for completeness , figure  [ fig|residuals ] also shows results from the monte carlo simulations performed by ( * ? ? ? * grey bands ) , which assume an intrinsic correlation of the type @xmath69 and include the selection bias on @xmath70 .",
    "these models reproduce the observed trends .",
    "several comments are in order .",
    "first , our results are robust against the efficiency of the agn feedback .",
    "indeed , in our reference model we fixed the agn feedback efficiency to obtain a stellar mass function as close as possible to the observations at the high - mass end ( c.f .",

    ", the agreement with the observed stellar mass function in figure  [ fig|scalingsmstar ] slightly worsens in the high - mass end , while the @xmath27-@xmath9  relation steepens-@xmath9  relation , mainly because agn feedback is more effective at clearing the gas in more massive galactic hosts , thus inhibiting the growth of especially the more massive black holes . ]",
    "( @xmath72 after including the effect of the selection bias ) , but not enough to fully match the observations ( for which slopes @xmath73 are usually quoted in the literature , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more importantly , the correlations of the residuals remain almost unchanged ( @xmath74 when fixing @xmath10 , and @xmath75 when fixing @xmath9 ) .",
    "second , we have checked that these correlations are not improved by considering a different choice of @xmath21 in equation  [ eq|rinfl ] ; by assuming no bias on the resolvability of the black - hole sphere of influence ; by considering all galaxies rather than just bulge - dominated ones ; by using the bulge mass instead of the total stellar mass ; or by using the the sdss @xmath9-@xmath28 relation ( e.g. , by the fits of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to compute velocity dispersions .",
    "third , the model s residuals shown in figure  [ fig|residuals ] do not account for measurement errors ( i.e. we compute the residuals for the model s exact predictions , without folding in any observational uncertainties ) .",
    "we have verified that including these errors can yield a steeper slope @xmath76 for the residuals at fixed @xmath10 , but this does not strengthen the correlations of the residuals shown above ( essentially because the error on @xmath77 also grows when @xmath77 grows ) .    to check",
    "if our results are due to the particular implementation of black - hole accretion and agn feedback in our semi - analytic model , and/or lack of sufficient `` coupling '' between velocity dispersion and agn feedback , we have performed a similar analysis of the horizon - agn simulation @xcite .",
    "this is a hydrodynamic cosmological simulation of a box with size @xmath78 mpc@xmath79 , run with the adaptive mesh refinement code ramses  @xcite , with @xmath80 dark - matter particles and a minimum mesh size of 1 kpc .",

    "the velocity dispersion of each galaxy is measured using only star particles within the effective radius of the galaxy .",
    "the results are shown in figures  [ fig|residuals_horizon ] and [ fig|gamma_horizon ] .",

    "we plan to consider different ( and possibly stronger ) models of agn feedback in future work . for now , the discrepancies highlighted in figures  [ fig|residuals ] and [ fig|residuals_horizon ] clearly show that correlations between the residuals of the @xmath27-@xmath9  and @xmath27-@xmath10  scaling relations are more powerful than the scaling relations themselves at constraining models for the co - evolution of black holes and their host galaxies .",
    "concerning the normalisation of the black - hole scaling relations , at face value our model clearly fails to reproduce the observed @xmath27-@xmath9  and @xmath27-@xmath10  relations at the same time . without invoking any selection effect , one could attempt to improve the simultaneous match to both the observed scaling relations by fine - tuning some of the key parameters in the model , namely the one controlling gas accretion onto the black hole and/or the energetic feedback from the central active nucleus .",
    "for example , increasing the efficiency of agn feedback could in principle decrease the stellar masses of the host galaxies at fixed black hole mass , thus possibly improving the match to the @xmath27-@xmath10  relation ( top right panel of figure  [ fig|scalingslight ] ) .",
    "however , this would then spoil the good match to the velocity dispersion - stellar mass relation .",
    "similarly , one could increase the accretion onto the central black hole at fixed star formation rate and final stellar mass of the host galaxy , with the aim of improving the match to the @xmath27-@xmath10  relation .",
    "this however would proportionally increase the @xmath27-@xmath9  relation above the data , when velocity dispersions are chosen to faithfully track those from the observed sdss @xmath86 relation ( purple lines in the left panels of figure  [ fig|scalingslight ] ) .",
    "concerning the dispersion around the scaling relations , our semi - analytic model , which self - consistently evolves black holes from seeds at high redshifts , naturally predicts very broad distributions in black - hole mass at fixed velocity dispersion or stellar mass , at relatively low masses @xmath34 .",
    "overall , these effects are in line with the results of the monte carlo simulations presented in @xcite , though the intrinsic scatters assumed there , especially in the @xmath27-@xmath9  relation , were always below @xmath87 dex .",
    "this was needed to avoid too flat slopes in the `` observed '' , biased relations . indeed , here",
    "our predicted slope of the @xmath27-@xmath9  relation , inclusive of observational bias ( e.g. , middle and bottom left panels of figure  [ fig|scalingslight ] ) , is approximately @xmath88 with slope @xmath89 , significantly flatter than the slopes @xmath90 usually quoted in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "conversely , a key point of our present work is that , irrespective of the chosen masses for the seed black holes , the model predicts relatively tight scaling relations at high stellar masses @xmath35 . in this respect , our model does not support the conjecture put forward by @xcite , according to which the @xmath27-@xmath9  relation is only an upper limit of a more or less uniform distribution of black holes .",
    "this is also in line with the monte carlo tests performed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure  11 ) , in which a very broad distribution of black holes extending to the lowest masses in all types of galaxies is highly disfavoured .",
    "nevertheless , figure  [ fig|scalingsreines ] shows that the present data on active galaxies may still be consistent with our model , once the proper flux limits and eddington ratio distributions are accounted for .",
    "therefore , an intrinsically broad distribution for the black - hole mass in relatively small galaxies with mass @xmath34 , extending down to black holes of mass @xmath91 or so , can not be excluded by present data , though it is highly disfavoured in more massive galaxies .",
    "models with such broad distributions , however , still tend to produce scaling relations flatter than observed , once the bias on the black - hole sphere of influence and on galaxy morphology is folded in the model predictions , as shown in figures  [ fig|scalingslight ] and [ fig|scalingsetgs ] .    finally , we stress again that our semi - analytic model fails to reproduce the observations when it comes to correlations between the _ residuals _ of the scaling relations . in more detail ,",
    "the model is consistent with the data for the correlation between the residuals in the @xmath27-@xmath9 relation and those in the @xmath28-@xmath9 relation , at fixed velocity dispersion .",
    "however , the model predicts almost no correlation between the residuals of the @xmath27-@xmath28 relations and those of the @xmath9-@xmath28 relation , at fixed stellar mass , while the data hint at a rather strong correlation .",
    "we have verified that these results are robust against changing the parameters of the model ( namely the agn feedback efficiency and the parameter regulating black - hole accretion ) .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the same weak correlation between the residuals at fixed stellar mass is also obtained in the hydrodynamic cosmological simulation horizon - agn  @xcite , which includes thermal quasar - mode feedback and jet - structured radio - mode agn feedback ( i.e. , processes which are expected to induce a stronger coupling between black - hole mass and velocity dispersion ) .",
    "another noteworthy point is that both our model and horizon - agn tend to produce slopes for the @xmath9-@xmath10  relation that are significantly steeper than the data , although in horizon - agn numerical resolution effects may bias the measurements of the velocity dispersion in lower - mass galaxies ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "our interpretation is that the weak correlation of the residuals at fixed stellar mass may be at least partly due to current agn feedback models being possibly too weak to capture the full effect of the black hole on the _ stellar _ velocity dispersion .",
    "while this is expected in a semi - analytic model such as ours , where the agn feedback is typically assumed to simply eject gas from the nuclear region  @xcite , it is more surprising in the horizon - agn simulation , which captures the back - reaction of the ejected gas onto the stellar and dark - matter dynamics  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , in hydrodynamic cosmological simulations such as horizon - agn , the spatial resolution is 1 kpc at best and may limit our capability to properly capture the interaction of agn winds with gas and its impact on the dynamics within galactic bulges .",
    "moreover , the horizon - agn simulation currently employs a rather crude model of agn feedback , mostly based on simple gas heating , to mimic the so - called `` quasar - mode '' feedback .",
    "more realistic models of agn feedback , also inclusive of momentum - driven winds and stronger coupling with the surrounding interstellar medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , might possibly be more effective at improving the comparison with the black hole - galaxy scaling relations and their residuals .",
    "we have compared the predictions of a comprehensive semi - analytic model of galaxy formation , which self - consistently evolves supermassive black holes from high - redshift seeds by accounting for gas accretion , mergers and agn feedback , with the observed scaling relations of the masses of supermassive black holes with stellar mass and velocity dispersion .",
    "our main conclusions are :    1 .   at @xmath35 ,",
    "the dispersion in black - hole mass at fixed stellar mass is @xmath92  dex  very few black holes with masses @xmath93 are predicted in such massive galaxies . however , for galaxies having @xmath34 , the distribution of @xmath27  at fixed @xmath9 or @xmath10  is broad .",
    "observational selection effects , associated with resolving the black - hole sphere of influence and/or with selecting bulge - dominated / elliptical galaxies , tighten the @xmath27-@xmath9  and @xmath27-@xmath10  scaling relations , bringing them into better agreement with the observations . 3 .",
    "no evident variation in agn feedback and/or black - hole accretion efficiencies can provide a _ simultaneous _ match to both scaling relations .",
    "this supports previous work suggesting an internal inconsistency between the observed @xmath27-@xmath9  and @xmath27-@xmath10  relations .",
    "galaxy - evolution models ( our semi - analytic one as well as the horizon - agn simulation ) predict almost _ no _ correlation between the residuals of the @xmath27-@xmath28 relations and those of the @xmath9-@xmath28 relation , at fixed stellar mass . since the data hint at a rather strong correlation ,",
    "this calls for revamped agn feedback recipes in the next generation of cosmological galaxy - evolution models .",
