    "recent papers @xcite have presented a general field theoretical discussion of the low energy properties of a spin @xmath3 impurity embedded in an antiferromagnet or a superconductor which is in the vicinity of a bulk spin - ordering quantum transition .",
    "these studies were motivated by a variety of recent experiments studying zn and ni impurities in the cuprate superconductors and spin - gap compounds .",
    "the motivations and prior work have been discussed in some detail in ref .",
    "( hereafter referred to as i ) , and so will not be repeated here .",
    "further theoretical @xcite , numerical @xcite , and experimental @xcite work on these issues has also appeared , and we will discuss some of these results below . there has also been related work on impurity models in systems with fermionic excitations @xcite .    the purpose of this paper is to provide additional results for the same quantum impurity problem using a different field - theoretic formulation .",
    "the results in i were obtained using an expansion in @xmath4 , where @xmath1 is the spatial dimensionality .",
    "stimulated mainly by the recent results of hglund and sandvik @xcite , we have succeeded in obtaining a formulation which permits an expansion in @xmath5 , and this will be described in the present paper .",
    "the universal scaling structure we shall describe below in the @xmath2 expansion turns out to be identical to that obtained in i using the @xmath4 expansion .",
    "this is strong evidence that a fixed point with the same scaling properties does indeed describe the physical situation in @xmath0 .    throughout this paper",
    ", we will implicitly assume in our discussion that @xmath6 , unless stated otherwise .",
    "the only exception is appendix  [ app : d3 ] , where we will present results in @xmath7 .",
    "also we will set @xmath8 , whereas in i the same symbol was used for @xmath4 .",
    "as we will see shortly , ( [ e4 ] ) is obtained for the case where the coupling between the impurity and the bulk antiferromagnet has scaled to infinity .",
    "this implies that at low energies the impurity moment is effectively locked along the direction of the local orientation of the bulk antiferromagnetic order .",
    "while such locking is appropriate near the quantum critical point , it is not a priori clear whether it should also hold at low @xmath12 above a well ordered antiferromagnet with @xmath35 .",
    "we will briefly address this issue by also examining the case of finite coupling ( see appendix  [ app : gamma ] ) : we find that the co - efficient of the @xmath40 term in ( [ e4 ] ) remains universal , but there are non - universal corrections to the @xmath41 term .    a separate category of our results concern @xmath42 at the quantum critical point , @xmath34 .",
    "these correspond to the large @xmath32 , @xmath43 , limit of ( [ e2 ] ) . here",
    ", it was argued in i that @xmath44 with @xmath45 a universal number .",
    "a @xmath4 expansion for @xmath45 was provided in i , and it contained non - trivial corrections to the free moment value of @xmath46 .",
    "sushkov @xcite has questioned the existence of such corrections , but we reply to his arguments in appendix  [ app : sushkov ]",
    ". the present paper will show that ( [ e5 ] ) is obeyed also in the @xmath2 expansion : in this case the @xmath2 expansion provides terms as corrections to the ` classical ' moment value of @xmath47 , and details of this appear in the body of the text , and the final result is in ( [ r12 ] ) .",
    "a number of other results for universal properties of the impurity correlations were provided in i using the @xmath4 expansion .",
    "all of these can also be computed in the @xmath2 expansion , and in every case we find complete agreement in the structure of the scaling properties .",
    "details of such computations also appear in the body of this paper .",
    "the following section will introduce the non - linear sigma model field theory which describes the dynamics of an impurity in a quantum antiferromagnet .",
    "section  [ sec : perturb ] will then discuss the perturbative structure of this theory , with details of the perturbative computations appearing in appendix  [ app : perturb ] .",
    "we will show how to deduce low temperature properties using this perturbation theory .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : rg ] presents a renormalization analysis which allows us to deduce the physical characteristics of the critical point .",
    "this section will introduce the field - theoretical formulation of the quantum impurity dynamics which enables an expansion of its universal properties in the @xmath2 expansion .",
    "in contrast to our earlier @xmath4 expansion , which used a ` soft - spin ' formulation of the bulk antiferromagnetic fluctuations , the present @xmath2 expansion will use the ` fixed - length ' representation of the o(3 ) non - linear sigma model .",
    "it is worth noting here that a perturbation theory in powers of @xmath9 can also be generated for an arbitrary value of @xmath61 , with @xmath75 ( no expansion in @xmath61 or @xmath3 is needed here ) . in this case",
    "there is an additional gapped excitation corresponding to the deviation of the impurity spin from the bulk antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations ( the gap of this excitation is of order @xmath61 ) .",
    "this perturbation theory is somewhat more cumbersome and is discussed briefly in appendix  [ app : gamma ] .",
    "before embarking upon the subtleties of a renormalization group analysis ( and the associated analytic continuation in dimensionality ) , it is useful to examine the expressions in appendix  [ app : impt ] directly in @xmath76 , in a regime where perturbation theory is valid .",
    "perturbation theory holds for small @xmath9 , or alternatively for ` large ' @xmath21 .",
    "consequently , direct perturbative results can be obtained in the renormalized - classical region with @xmath28 .",
    "we discuss some important features of the perturbation theory here , with further details appearing in appendix  [ app : perturb ] . for dimensions",
    "@xmath33 , there is long - range magnetic order for @xmath77 at @xmath17 , but rotation symmetry is restored at any @xmath19 . this singular phenomenon accounted for by a two - step integration procedure which has been discussed in detail in sections 6.3.2 and 7.1.2 of ref .",
    ": first we integrate out the modes with matsubara frequency @xmath78 , and then subsequently perform a rotational average over the static modes by an exact procedure . the first step is easily performed by a perturbation theory in which we assume that the local magnetic order is polarized along , say , the @xmath79 direction . we obtain an expansion for the free energy in the presence of an applied magnetic field @xmath80 , which we assume has the value @xmath81 this expansion is discussed in some detail in appendix  [ app : impt ] , and yields the following expression for the free energy @xmath82 here @xmath83 is the free energy in zero field . in ( [ a7 ] ) @xmath84 has the apparent interpretation of the local magnetic moment of the impurity , while @xmath85 appear to be the transverse and longitudinal susceptibilities .",
    "however , it must be kept in mind that we are working in a @xmath19 regime where the magnetic order is ultimately averaged over and so @xmath84 , @xmath86 are merely intermediate quantities which arise in our computation , and do not have independent physical meaning . for @xmath87",
    "the moment @xmath84 is quantized exactly at the value @xmath88 at @xmath17 , but corrections do appear at @xmath19 , as shown in appendix  [ app : impt ] . following the method discussed in section 6.3.2 of ref .",
    ", to the order in perturbation theory being considered here , the second step of rotational averaging over the directions of the local magnetization leads to the following expression for the physical magnetic susceptibility @xmath89 only the final quantity @xmath90 is a physical observable at @xmath19 .",
    "we can divide the contributions to the quantities in ( [ a8 ] ) to those arising from the bulk antiferromagnet ( which are proportional to its volume ) and to those associated with the impurity .",
    "first , for completeness , we recall results for the bulk susceptibilities , which are implicitly expressed per unit volume ; there is no bulk contribution to the magnetic moment @xmath84 .",
    "the results of bare perturbation theory for the bulk susceptibilities quantities are given in ( [ perpb ] ) and ( [ parb ] ) .",
    "we re - express the results by replacing @xmath9 by the physical @xmath21 ; these two quantities are related by @xcite @xmath91 .",
    "\\label{rhos}\\ ] ] in this manner , we obtain @xmath92 notice that both expressions have an ultraviolet divergence for @xmath93 , and so depend on the upper cutoff of the momentum integration .",
    "however , this divergence disappears in the physical bulk susceptibility @xmath94 the last expression has been evaluated in @xmath0 , and we have re - inserted factors of @xmath22 ; this result has appeared earlier in the literature @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to see how ( [ chib ] ) can also be obtained by the dimensionally regularized expressions in ( [ perpb ] ) and ( [ parb ] ) . in dimensional regularization , the relationship ( [ rhos ] ) becomes simply @xmath95 ; substituting this into the integrals already evaluated in ( [ perpb ] ) and ( [ parb ] ) we obtain @xmath96 here @xmath97 is the gamma function , and @xmath98 is the riemann zeta function .",
    "( [ chib1 ] ) agrees with ( [ chib ] ) after using @xmath99 .    after subtracting out the bulk contributions to ( [ a7 ] ) ,",
    "we are left with the impurity magnetization and susceptibilities .",
    "these can be computed by the same method as for the bulk susceptibilities .",
    "we will discuss the impurity response to a uniform magnetic field at @xmath19 in section  [ sec : imp ] .",
    "section  [ sec : loc ] will consider the case of a local magnetic field applied only in the vicinity of the impurity site , while section  [ sec : zero ] generalizes our results to a uniform magnetic field at @xmath17 .",
    "evaluating first the frequency summations in ( [ mexp ] ) , then inserting ( [ rhos ] ) , we obtain the following result for the impurity magnetic moment , @xmath84 , as an expansion in @xmath100 : @xmath101 \\label{be1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that while intermediate terms ( like those in ( [ rhos ] ) ) had a linear ultraviolet divergence in @xmath0 , the final expressions only have a logarithmic dependence upon the ultraviolet cutoff in @xmath0 . unlike the case for the bulk susceptibility above , this divergence will not cancel against any other term .",

    "the @xmath107 limit of @xmath122 then leads directly to ( [ e3 ] ) .",
    "we are unable to obtain the values of the universal constants @xmath123 because accurate results for the critical point are only possible for @xmath1 close to 1 , but in that case the logarithms of ( [ e3 ] ) are absent .",
    "a significant feature of these results for @xmath90 is that while there is a @xmath124 term , the @xmath125 terms have cancelled against each other ; alternatively stated , the double pole in @xmath109 that is apparently present in ( [ ae6 ] ) ( associated with @xmath126 ^ 2 $ ] ) turns out to have vanishing residue because @xmath127 .",
    "this is an indication that this particular log singularity does not exponentiate upon inclusion of higher order terms , and is rather a consequence of goldstone spin - wave fluctuations , as opposed to a critical singularity .",
    "we now consider the _ local _ susceptiblity , @xmath128 which is the response to a field applied at the impurity site only .",
    "this is to be distinguished from the impurity susceptibility which is the response to a uniform field , after subtracting out the bulk contribution .",
    "the small @xmath9 expansion for @xmath128 is discussed in appendix  [ app : loc ] .",
    "the relationship ( [ a8 ] ) now generalizes to @xmath129 and expressions for the terms on the r.h.s .",
    "appear in ( [ apploc1 ] ) .",
    "evaluating the frequency summations and the momentum integrals with a cutoff @xmath102 we obtain in @xmath0 @xmath130 here @xmath131 is a non - universal impurity moment which depends upon microscopic details like the local coupling constants and the precise location over which the field is applied .",
    "it is , in general , not equal to @xmath3 , the moment which appears in @xmath90 .",
    "similarly , @xmath132 are non - universal numbers .",
    "note however , that as in ( [ e4 ] ) , there is no term of order @xmath133 .",
    "the divergent impurity susceptibilities obtained above as @xmath134 suggest that the response to a field will be singular at @xmath17 .    at @xmath17 , the magnetic symmetry is broken for @xmath135 and small @xmath9 , and so the quantities @xmath84 , @xmath113 , and @xmath112 retain their separate physical identities and can be distinguished experimentally .    the calculation of the impurity response to a magnetic field at @xmath17 proceeds in a manner similar to that at @xmath19 .",
    "the first crucial observation is that we now have@xcite @xmath136 to all orders in @xmath9 .",
    "this is a consequence of a ` gauge invariance ' of the action @xmath74 associated with the preserved symmetry of rotations about the @xmath137 axis , and the transformation ( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "explicitly , it is not difficult to check that upon converting the frequency summations to integrals in ( [ mexp ] ) and ( [ parexp ] ) , and evaluating the frequency integrals , the results in ( [ x1 ] ) hold to order @xmath138this is a strong check on our computations .",
    "it remains to compute the transverse susceptibility @xmath112 . because of the broken spin rotation symmetry",
    ", this quantity is not protected by gauge invariance ( the gauge symmetry is ` broken ' ) , and it has non - zero contributions at each order in perturbation theory .",
    "however , certain terms in the perturbation theory have an infrared divergence for @xmath18 in the presence of fully o(3 ) symmetric hamiltonian , and so we examine the full non - linear dependence of the impurity free energy on the applied field , @xmath139 .",
    "the perturbative computation of @xmath140 is described in appendix  [ app : zero ] , and from ( [ zero2 ] ) we obtain for @xmath141 @xmath142 this result , and the structure of the perturbation theory in appendix  [ app : zero ] , suggest the follow universal scaling form for the critical behavior of @xmath143 near the critical point : @xmath144 the results here and in i imply that this scaling form holds for all @xmath6 .",
    "the results of i implicitly assumed an analytic dependence of @xmath140 on small @xmath145 , so that @xmath146 for small @xmath32 .",
    "however , our computations here show that this analyticity holds only for @xmath147 , and that there is a leading non - analytic dependence with @xmath148 for @xmath149 . precisely in @xmath0",
    ", there is a pole in @xmath150 defined in ( [ x2 ] ) , and as in our discussion for @xmath84 , this implies a logarithmic singularity : @xmath151 where @xmath152 is an unknown universal number . in the ordered state in @xmath0 , well away from the critical point , we have from ( [ zero2 ] ) , and as in ( [ e4 ] ) @xmath153 where @xmath154 is a non - universal number . the logarithmic singularities in ( [ x4 ] ) and ( [ x5 ] ) can be cut - off by spin - anisotropies in the underlying hamiltonian , as has been illustrated in appendix  [ app : zero ] .",
    "there is already a well - established theory@xcite for the bulk phase transition at @xmath34 . here",
    "we will show how this theory can be extended to the impurity correlations .",
    "this will be done with a single additional impurity wavefunction renormalization constant @xmath155from the perspective of boundary critical phenomena , this is a boundary renormalization factor at the impurity site @xmath52 . as noted earlier , the berry phase in @xmath72 is an exactly marginal perturbation to the bulk critical point : it is protected by its topological nature , and hence there is no additional coupling constant renormalization associated with the impurity spin .",
    "we will use this critical theory to obtain results for the impurity and local susceptibilities at @xmath19 , and for the field dependence of the free energy at @xmath17 .",
    "first , let us recall the bulk renormalization theory from ref .  .",
    "there is a field renormalization factor , @xmath156 , defined by @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the renormalized field . in the present quantum impurity context , this renormalization will be adequate at all spatial points away from the impurity , as has been indicated above .",
    "second , ref .   has a coupling constant renormalization @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the renormalized dimensionless coupling constant , @xmath161 is a cut - off momentum scale , and @xmath162 is a phase - space factor . to two - loop order and in the minimal subtraction scheme , these bulk renormalization constants are given by @xcite @xmath163 where @xmath164 these constants give the beta function @xmath165 which has a fixed point at @xmath166 which describes the bulk quantum critical point , with @xmath167    let us now turn to the impurity correlations .",
    "these require only an additional boundary wavefunction renormalization which we define by @xmath168 we discuss the computation of @xmath155 in appendix  [ app : eta ] , where we find @xmath169 this renormalization constant implies that impurity spin correlations behave as @xmath170 where @xmath171 here @xmath64 is the nearly - vanishing anomalous dimension of the bulk critical point which was mentioned in section  [ sec : ft]it controls the decay of @xmath172 correlations sufficiently far away from the impurity : @xmath173    the results in appendix  [ app : impt ] can also be easily used to obtain an @xmath174 expansion for the universal constant @xmath45 in ( [ e5 ] ) which determines the anomalous curie response of @xmath90 at the critical point .",
    "we begin by substituting the renormalized coupling @xmath160 defined by ( [ r2 ] ) into the dimensionally regularized expression for @xmath90 defined by ( [ a8 ] ) , ( [ mexp ] ) , ( [ perpexp ] ) , and ( [ parexp ] ) .",
    "we expand the resulting expression to order @xmath175 , and then expand the coefficient of each such term in powers of @xmath174 .",
    "consistency of the theory demands that poles in @xmath174 cancel at this point , and this is indeed the case .",
    "finally we substitute the fixed - point value @xmath166 in ( [ r6 ] ) into this expression .",
    "we find that all dependence upon @xmath161 disappears at this point , which is strong evidence for the universality expressed by ( [ e2 ] ) ; the final expression then yields @xmath176 as is also the case with the bulk exponents in the @xmath177 expansion , we do not expect the estimate of ( [ r12 ] ) to be accurate at @xmath178 .",
    "as discussed in i , we expect on physical grounds that @xmath179 .",
    "next we consider the local susceptibility . as in i , this diverges near the critical point as @xmath180 with @xmath181 a universal scaling function ; the small argument behavior of @xmath181 should be compatible with ( [ loc2 ] ) , while its infinite argument limit is a constant . by analysis",
    "similar to that outlined in the previous paragraph , the expressions in appendix  [ app : loc ] can be verified to be consistent with ( [ r13 ] ) and the value of @xmath182 in ( [ r10 ] ) .",
    "finally , we turn to the response to an applied field at @xmath17 , discussed earlier in section  [ sec : zero ] and also in appendix  [ app : zero ] . at the critical point ,",
    "any applied @xmath183 will induce long - range magnetic order in the bulk@xcite for @xmath184 . the scaling form ( [ x3 ] ) nevertheless holds as @xmath38 , and we therefore obtain @xmath185 where @xmath186 is a universal number .",
    "this universal number can be obtained directly from ( [ zero2 ] ) by the methods discussed above for @xmath90 , and we obtain @xmath187",
    "this paper has introduced the field theory ( [ simpn ] ) as a description of the low temperature properties of arbitrary static impurities in quantum antiferromagnets .",
    "the bulk fluctuations of the antiferromagnet are described by the familiar o(3 ) quantum non - linear sigma model .",
    "remarkably , this venerable and strongly interacting field theory permits an exactly marginal perturbation , albeit on a ` boundary ' , which has not been noticed before : this is the topological berry phase of a spin @xmath3 impurity .",
    "we have computed here the physical consequences of this marginal perturbation and so obtained a new description of the spin dynamics of the impurity .",
    "a preliminary comparison has been made@xcite between our theoretical result ( [ e4 ] ) and the numerical results of ref .  .",
    "reasonable agreement is found for the impurity susceptibility of a vacancy , and a more detailed comparison will appear later .    near the quantum critical point associated with the loss of long - range antiferromagnetic order ,",
    "our results were obtained in an expansion in @xmath2 .",
    "key scaling features of these results were found to be in good accord with those obtained earlier in a @xmath4 expansion in i. in particular , right at the critical point , we confirmed the existence of a curie @xmath188 impurity spin susceptibility but with an anomalous curie constant not given by an integer or half - odd - integer spin .",
    "our new result for the curie constant is in ( [ r12 ] ) .",
    "although the numerical estimates for critical properties obtained from the @xmath2 expansion seem rather unreliable , this expansion nevertheless provides convincing evidence for the existence of a strongly - coupled impurity fixed point with the physical properties discussed herein and in i.    we are very grateful to anders sandvik and kaj hglund for informing us about their results prior to publication and for useful discussions .",
    "we also thank oleg sushkov for valuable discussions ; he has obtained results @xcite which overlap with the present paper .",
    "this research was supported by us nsf grant dmr 0098226 and the dfg center for functional nanostructures at the university of karlsruhe .",
    "we will consider perturbation theory in the presence of an applied uniform magnetic field @xmath80 under which ( [ simpn ] ) is modified by @xmath189 this construction ensures that @xmath80 couples to a conserved total spin of the hamiltonian .",
    "as in refs .  , the perturbation theory in @xmath9 is generated by assuming that @xmath172 is locally polarized along a particular direction ( say ( 0,0,1 ) ) , and by expanding in deviations of @xmath172 about this direction .",

    "this appendix will consider the general @xmath61 case , and consider the extent to which the low @xmath12 properties away from the critical point are independent of the value of @xmath61 .",
    "this appendix briefly describes the extension of our results to @xmath7 .",
    "the bulk quantum critical point in @xmath7 does not satisfy strong scaling properties , and so we will not consider it here .",
    "we will focus only on the low @xmath12 properties within the magnetically ordered state , well away from any quantum critical point .",
    "magnetic long - range order is present for a finite range of @xmath19 , and so the magnetic response remains anisotropic as @xmath229 .",
    "the quantities @xmath84 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 retain their separate physical identities , and can be measured separately .",
    "the low @xmath12 expansions for @xmath84 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 are obtained as in appendix  [ app : perturb ] .",
    "indeed , now we need not separate the @xmath230 and the @xmath78 modes as there is long - range order for @xmath19 : the expressions in appendix  [ app : perturb ] can therefore be used here , after converting all frequency summations to run over both zero and non - zero values of matsubara frequencies . in this manner , ( [ be1 ] )",
    "is modified to @xmath231 .",
    "\\label{d31}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] evaluating the momentum integrations , and re - inserting factors of @xmath22 , we obtain @xmath232 interestingly , the expression ( [ d32 ] ) can also be obtained simply by setting @xmath7 in ( [ be3 ] ) . for the finite @xmath61 case , discussed in appendix  [ app : gamma ] ,",
    "the @xmath233 term above remains unchanged , while the @xmath234 term does acquire @xmath61-dependent corrections .",
    "the results for @xmath113 and @xmath112 now follow from ( [ parexp ] ) and ( [ perpexp ] ) . setting @xmath7 in the dimensionally regularized expressions here",
    ", we find that the co - efficient of the universal @xmath235 term vanishes for both quantities .",
    "however , there are non - universal @xmath233 corrections for both @xmath113 and @xmath112 , and these have to be estimated directly from the expressions in ( [ parexp ] ) and ( [ perpexp ] ) : the frequency summations have to be evaluated first ( including the zero matsubara frequencies ) , and then the momentum integrations have to be evaluated with a finite cutoff .",
    "similar techniques apply to the response to a local field discussed in appendix  [ app : loc ] .",
    "now we obtain the universal correction @xmath236 along with non - universal @xmath233 corrections to @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",
    "the factor of 2 difference between the @xmath233 terms in ( [ d33 ] ) and ( [ d32 ] ) is an interesting characteristic of the theory .",
    "it has been claimed by sushkov @xcite that the curie constant remains @xmath239 for a @xmath240 impurity at the quantum critical point of an antiferromagnet . here",
    "we show using the model of his paper that there is a perturbative correction to the impurity susceptibility , and that this implies an anomalous curie constant . of course",
    ", the possibility remains open that the @xmath4 and @xmath2 expansions both fail in @xmath0 near the critical point , but reasons for such a possible failure do not appear in sushkov s arguments .",
    "sushkov models the bulk spin fluctuations at the quantum critical point using a @xmath241 boson @xmath242 , as in ref .  .",
    "these bosons are coupled to the external magnetic field @xmath243 ( assumed oriented along the @xmath137 axis ) and to the impurity moment @xmath244 .",
    "this gives us the model considered by sushkov : @xmath245 where @xmath246 is the momentum of the @xmath242 bosons with energy @xmath247 , and @xmath248 and @xmath249 it can be checked that @xmath243 couples to the total spin , which commutes with the hamiltonian .",
    "now we compute the free energy , @xmath250 , in a power series in @xmath251 in arbitrary @xmath243 . to second order in @xmath251 ,",
    "this is done by the familiar formula @xmath252 where @xmath253 everything in ( [ ae1 ] ) and ( [ ae2 ] ) can be evaluated analytically by simple means , and then we can perform the integrals over @xmath51 and @xmath254 - this was done using the computer program mathematica for arbitrary @xmath243 and @xmath3 , without using any diagrammatic perturbation theory .",
    "finally , we can expand the result in powers of @xmath243 and obtain for the impurity susceptibility @xmath255 this result agrees precisely with that obtained using a diagrammatic approach in i. it disagrees with that of sushkov , who did not obtain any correction to the first free moment term  he does not appear to have considered the cross - correlation between the bulk magnetization of the @xmath242 and the impurity magnetization .",
    "note that this disagreement appears already at the level of bare perturbation theory , and does not involve any of the subtleties associated with approaching the scaling limit at the critical point in the @xmath174 or @xmath256 expansions .    in the quantum disordered regime above the paramagnetic phase , we can model @xmath257 , where @xmath258 is the spin gap @xcite ; here ( [ ae3 ] ) predicts a contribution of order @xmath259 to the susceptibility , and so the moment is indeed precisely quantized at @xmath3 .",
    "however , the quantum critical region @xcite we have @xmath260 , and then ( [ ae3 ] ) yields a contribution to the susceptibility of order @xmath261 . for @xmath262 , the dimensionless combination @xmath263 approaches a universal value at the fixed point , and a universal irrational correction to the curie term applies , as shown in much detail in i.                        n.  katoh and m.  imada , j. phys .",
