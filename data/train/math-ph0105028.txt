    "the theoretical treatment of many - body systems is of a fundamental importance for a variety of branches in physics .",
    "of particular relevance to this work are highly excited systems that consist of a finite number of charged particles .",
    "such systems are encountered in processes involving simultaneous excitations of few particles , e.g. as is the case in a multiple ionization reaction . from a theoretical point of view it is fortunate that the scattering states of two particles interacting via the coulomb potential are known exactly , for such states can serve as a benchmark for approximate methods that are developed to deal with more complex systems .",
    "for example , the perturbative ( born ) treatment of the two - particle coulomb scattering and the comparison with the exact results gives a first hint on the problems connected with treatment of coulomb scattering : the first order term of the born perturbation series delivers already the correct results for the scattering cross section .",
    "higher order terms are however divergent .",
    "this problem is mainly traced back to the infinite range of the coulomb interaction that prohibits free motion in the asymptotic regime .    in the theoretical treatment of more than two particle systems",
    "a further fundamental difficulty arises which stems from the inherent non - separability of many - body interacting systems .",
    "this problem is of a general nature and appears basically for almost all forms of the inter - particle interactions .",
    "this work provides an overview on recent theoretical efforts to tackle analytically the problems connected with the infinite - range tail of coulomb potentials and the non - seprabale aspects of many - body systems .",
    "as will be shown below , generally this can be done only in an approximate way . to deal with the long - range coulomb interaction one dismisses the use of standard many - body approaches and attempts at a direct ( approximate ) solution of the many - body non - relativistic schrdinger equation . to expose the general feature of coulomb potential scattering and to introduce the basic methods used to solve the schrdinger equation we start with a brief review of the two - particle rutherford scattering .",
    "the three - body coulomb scattering problem has received recently much of attention @xcite . in this work",
    "we focus only on one aspect of this problem , namely the existence of an approximate separability that allows to derive three - body wave functions valid in certain region of the hilbert space . for the general case of a system consisting of @xmath0 interacting charged particles we derive correlated scattering states that are to a first order in the distance",
    "exact at larger inter - particle separation .",
    "the wave function approach is of a limited value when it comes to the study of thermodynamic properties and critical phenomena in finite systems . in this case",
    "detailed information on the density of states is needed .",
    "such information is encompassed in the many - body green function .",
    "therefore we devote a section of this work to a general scheme for the derivation of the many - body green operator and briefly review a possible method to extract thermodynamic information on finite systems starting from the green function .    unless otherwise stated we employ atomic units throughout and neglect relativistic corrections .",
    "to introduce the general frame work and the basic notation let us consider the non - relativistic scattering states of two charged particles with charges @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",

    "@xmath7 is the reduced mass of the two particles . to decouple kinematics from dynamics",
    "we make the ansatz : @xmath8 the distortion factor @xmath9 in eq.([an2 ] ) is solely due to the presence of the potential .",
    "the asymptotic properties of ( [ sch2 ] ) follows upon substitution of ( [ an2 ] ) in ( [ sch2 ] ) .",
    "then , terms that fall off faster than the coulomb potential can be neglected which leads to the equation @xmath10",
    "\\bar{\\psi}_{\\bf k}({\\bf r})=0 .",
    "\\label{as2}\\ ] ] this equation can be solved by the ansatz @xmath11 . upon insertion in eq.([as2 ] ) this ansatz yields @xmath12 the factor @xmath13 is called the sommerfeld parameter and characterizes the strength of the interaction .",
    "the integration constant @xmath14 has a dimension of a reciprocal length and the value @xmath15 .",
    "the important point here is that the natural coordinate that appears in the treatment of coulomb scattering is the so - called _ parabolic _ coordinate @xmath16 where the @xmath17 or @xmath18 corresponds respectively to incoming or outgoing - wave boundary conditions .",
    "in contrast to the two - body problem , an exact derivation of the three - body quantum states is not possible .",
    "nonetheless , under certain ( asymptotic ) assumptions analytical solutions can be obtained that contain some general features of the two - body scattering , such as the characteristic asymptotic phases . as in the preceding section the center - of - mass motion of a three - body system can be factored out .",
    "the internal motion of the three charged particles with masses @xmath19 and charges @xmath20 can be described by one set of the three jacobi coordinates @xmath21 .",
    "here @xmath22 is the relative internal separation of the pair @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the position of the third particle ( @xmath25 ) with respect to the center of mass of the pair @xmath23 .",
    "the three sets of jacobi coordinates are connected with each other via the transformation @xmath26 where @xmath27 the reduced masses are defined as @xmath28 .",
    "accordingly , the momenta conjugate to ( @xmath29 ) are defined as @xmath30 .",
    "these momenta are related to each other by @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are transposed matrices of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "the scalar product @xmath36 is invariant for all three sets of jacobi coordinates .",
    "the kinetic energy operator @xmath37 is then diagonal and reads @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "the eigenenergy of ( [ frei ] ) is then given as @xmath40 the time - independent schrdinger equation of the system reads @xmath41   \\ \\langle { \\bf r}_{kl},{\\bf r}_{m}|\\psi_{{\\bf k}_{kl},{\\bf k}_{m } }   \\rangle = 0\\ .",
    "\\label{schraa}\\ \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we defined the product charges @xmath42 ; @xmath43 .",
    "the relative coordinates @xmath44 occurring in the coulomb potentials have to be expressed in terms of the appropriately chosen jacobi - coordinate set ( @xmath45 ) . + asymptotic scattering solutions of ( [ schraa ] ) for large interparticle distances @xmath22 have the form @xcite : @xmath46 the @xmath17 and @xmath18 signs refer to outgoing and incoming boundary conditions , respectively . similarly to the two - body problem , the sommerfeld - parameter @xmath47 are given by @xmath48 the asymptotic state ( [ red ] ) is a straightforward generalization of the two - body asymptotic given by eq.([an2 ] ) to three - body systems .",
    "however , unlike the situation in two - body scattering , in three - body systems other types of asymptotic are present where , in a certain set ( @xmath29 ) , one jacobi coordinate tends to infinity whereas the other coordinate remains finite @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic states ( [ red ] ) serve as the boundary conditions that have to be satisfied by the scattering solutions of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the derivation of these solutions is a delicate task and will be the subject of the remainder of this section .",
    "the general approach here is to consider the three - body system as the subsume of three non - interacting two - body subsystems @xcite .",
    "since we know the appropriate coordinates for each of these two - body subsystems ( the parabolic coordinates ) we formulate the three - body problem in a similar coordinate frame with @xmath49 , \\label{cor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 denote the directions of the momenta @xmath51 .",
    "since we are dealing with a six - dimensional problem three other independent coordinates are needed in addition to ( [ cor ] ) . to make a reasonable choice for these remaining coordinates we remark that , usually , the momenta @xmath51 are determined experimentally , i. e. they can be considered as the laboratory - fixed coordinates .",

    "this result is valid if the contributions of @xmath58 and @xmath60 are negligible as compared to @xmath56 , which is in fact the case for large interparticle separations @xcite _ or _ at high particles energies .",
    "it should be noted that this same result can deduced in a jacobi coordinate system however the operators @xmath56 , @xmath58 and @xmath60 have a much more complex representation in the jacobi coordinates ( cf .",
    "ref.@xcite ) .    with decomposing the total hamiltonian in @xmath56 , @xmath71 and @xmath60 we achieved a result similar to that obtained by pines @xcite and co - worker for the interacting electron gas :",
    "the system is decomposed into a long - range and a short range components described respectively by @xmath56 and @xmath58 . as clear from eq.([red ] ) , the eigenfunctions of @xmath56 have an oscillatory asymptotic behaviour whereas the eigenstates of @xmath58 decay for large interparticle distances @xcite .",
    "the mixing term @xmath60 couples the short - range to the long - range modes of the system .",
    "the analytical structure of the eqs.([comp]-[lmix ] ) deserves several remarks :    * the total potential is contained in the operator @xmath56 , as can be seen from eqs.([hj ] ) .",
    "thus , the eigenstates of @xmath56 treats the total potential in an exact manner .",
    "this means on the other hand that the operators @xmath58 and @xmath60 are parts of the kinetic energy operator .",
    "this situation is to be contrasted with other treatments @xcite of the three - body problem in regions of the space space where the potential is smooth , e.g. near a saddle point . in this case one",
    "usually expands the potential around the fix point and accounts for the kinetic energy in an exact manner . * in eq.([hj ] ) the total potential appears as a sum of three two - body potentials .",
    "it should be stressed , that this splitting is arbitrary , since the dynamics is controlled by the total potential .",
    "i.e. , any other splitting that leaves the total potential invariant is equally justified .",
    "this fact we will use below for the construction of three - body states . for large inter - particle separation",
    "the operators @xmath58 and @xmath72 are negligible as compared to @xmath56 and the splitting of the total potential as done in eqs.([hj ] ) becomes unique .",
    "this means , for large particles separation the three - body dynamics is controlled by sequential two - body scattering events . * the momentum vectors",
    "@xmath51 enter the schrdinger equation via the asymptotic boundary conditions .",
    "thus , their physical meaning , as two - body relative momenta , is restricted to the asymptotic region of large inter - particle distances .",
    "the consequence of this conclusion is that , in general , any combination or functional form of the momenta @xmath51 is legitimate as long as the total energy is conserved and the boundary conditions are fulfilled ( the energies and the wave vectors are liked via a parabolic dispersion relation ) .",
    "this fact has been employed in ref.@xcite to constructed three - body wave functions with position - dependent momenta @xmath51 and in ref.@xcite to account for off - shell transitions . *",
    "the separability of the operators ( [ xi_4]-[xi_6 ] ) may be used to deduce representations of three - body states @xcite that diagonalize simultaneously @xmath56 and @xmath58 .",
    "it should be noted however , that generally the operator @xmath60 , which has to be neglected in this case , falls off with distance as fast as @xmath58 . * as well - known , each separability of a system implies a related conserved quantity . in the present case",
    "we can only speak of an approximate separability and hence of approximate conserved quantum numbers .",
    "+ if we discard @xmath58 and @xmath60 in favor of @xmath73 , which is justified for @xmath74 $ ] ( i.e.  for a large @xmath75 or for a high two particle momentum @xmath76 ) , the three - body good quantum numbers are related to those in a two - body system in parabolic coordinates . the latter",
    "are the two - body energy , the eigenvalue of the component of the lenz - runge operator along a quantization axis @xmath77 and the eigenvalue of the component of the angular momentum operator along @xmath77 . in our case the quantization axis @xmath77",
    "is given by the linear momentum direction @xmath78 .",
    "+ in ref.@xcite the three - body problem has been formulated in hyperspherical - parabolic coordinates . in this case",
    "the operator @xmath58 takes on the form of the grand angular momentum operator .",
    "this observation is useful to expose the relevant angular momentum quantum numbers in case @xmath60 can be neglected . * in ref.@xcite",
    "the three - body system has been expressed in the coordinates @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "this is the direct extension of the parabolic coordinates for the body problem ( cf .",
    "section 3 ) to the three - body problem . from a physical point of view",
    "this choice is not quite suited , for scattering states are sufficiently quantified by outgoing or incoming wave boundary conditions ( in contrast to standing waves , such as bound states whose representation requires a combination of incoming and outgoing waves ) .",
    "therefore , to account for the boundary conditions in scattering problems , either the coordinates @xmath81 or @xmath82 are needed .",
    "the appropriate choice of the remaining three coordinates should be made on the basis of the form of the forces governing the three - body system . in the present case",
    "where external fields are absent we have chosen @xmath83 as the natural coordinates adopted to the potential energy operator .      in the preceding sections we pointed out that the eigenstates of @xmath56 can be deduced analytically .",
    "these eigenfunctions , even though are well defined in the entire hilbert space , constitute a justifiable approximation to the exact three - body state in the asymptotic region only ( e.g.  in the region of larger inter - particle separation or for higher energies ) .",
    "this fact is important when it comes to evaluating reaction amplitudes , for such amplitudes involve the many - body scattering state in the entire hilbert space .",
    "therefore , an adequate description of the short - range dynamics may be necessary , in particular in cases where the contributions to the matrix elements of the transition amplitudes originates from the internal region , i.e. when the reaction takes place at small interparticle distances . nevertheless the eigenstates of @xmath56 can , and have been used for the calculations of transition matrix elements , as for example done below . in this case the justification of this doing must go beyond the asymptotic correctness argument .    in this section",
    "we seek three - body wave functions that diagonalize , in addition to @xmath56 , parts of @xmath58 and @xmath60 .",
    "one method that turned out to be particularly effective for this purpose relies on the observations : a ) in a three - body system the form of the two - body potentials @xmath84 are generally irrelevant , as long as the total potential is conserved .",
    "c ) to keep the mathematical structure of the operators ( [ comp],[hj ] ) unchanged and to introduce a splitting of the total potential while maintaining the total potential s rotational invariance one can assume the strength of the individual two - body interactions , characterized by @xmath85 , to be dependent on @xmath59 .",
    "this means we introduce position dependent product charges as @xmath86 with @xmath87 to obtain the _ many - body _",
    "potentials @xmath88 we express them as a linear mixing of the isolated _ two - body _",
    "interactions @xmath89 , i.  e. @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a @xmath92 matrix .",
    "the matrix elements are then determined according to 1 ) the properties of the total potential surface , 2 ) to reproduce the correct asymptotic of the three - body states and 3 ) in a way that minimizes @xmath58 and @xmath60 .",
    "it should be stressed that the procedure until this stage is exact .",
    "it is merely a splitting of the total potential that leaves this potential and hence the three - body schrdinger equation unchanged .      to be specific let us demonstrate the method for the case of two electrons moving in the coulomb field of a residual ions .",
    "this brings about some simplifications since the ion can be considered infinitely heavy as compared to the electron mass .",
    "traditionally , the electrons are labeled @xmath14 and @xmath93 and their positions and momenta with respect to the residual ion are respectively called @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , @xmath97 . adopting this notation ,",
    "the eigenstate of the operator @xmath56 reads : @xmath98 here we denoted the relative electron - electron momentum by @xmath99 whereas @xmath100 $ ] stands for the confluent hypergeometric function and @xmath101 are the sommerfeld parameters @xmath102 with @xmath103 being the velocities corresponding to the momenta @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the electrons - ion and electron - electron effective product charges , respectively .",
    "the form of @xmath106 is still to be determined .",
    "below the functions @xmath107 are given that preserve the total potential , possess the correct three - body asymptotic and incorporate features of the many - particle motion at the complete fragmentation threshold , namely @xmath108 along the saddle point of the total potential , the so - called wannier ridge @xcite . since @xmath106 are assumed to depend on the internal coordinates only ( @xmath109 ) the wave function ( [ ds3c ] ) is still an eigenstate of the long - range hamiltonian @xmath56 ( given by eq.[hj ] ) .",
    "in physical terms it can be said that the effect of the short - range part of the hamiltonian is to modify dynamically the coupling strength of the isolated two particle system ( @xmath85 ) .    to ensure the invariance of the schrdinger equation under the introduction of the product charges @xmath107 the three conditions @xmath110 have to be fulfilled ( @xmath111 is the electron - electron relative coordinate and @xmath77 is the charge of the residual ion ) .",
    "the wave functions containing @xmath106 must be compatible with the three - body asymptotic boundary conditions .",
    "these are specified by the shape and size of the triangle formed by the three particles ( two electrons and the ion ) : i. e. , the derived wave function must be , to a leading order , an asymptotic solution of the three - body schrdinger equation when the aforementioned triangle tends to a line ( two particles are close to each other and far away from the third particle ) or in the case where , for an arbitrary shape , the size of this triangle becomes infinite .",
    "the latter limit implies that all interparticle coordinates @xmath112 must grow with the same order , otherwise we eventually fall back to the limit of the three - particle triangle being reduced to a line @xcite , as described above .",
    "in addition we require the wannier threshold law for double electron escape to be reproduced when the derived wave functions are used for the evaluation of the matrix elements . + all of the above conditions are sufficient to determine @xmath106 and thus the wave function ( [ ds3c ] ) .",
    "this wave function is called `` dynamically screened three - body coulomb wave function '' @xmath113 .",
    "this is because this wave function consists formally of three coulomb waves @xmath108 where the short - range dynamics enters as a dynamical screening of the strength of the two - body interaction .",
    "the applicability of the wave function @xmath113 to scattering reactions is hampered by the involved functional dependence leading to complications in the numerical determination of the normalization and of the scattering matrix elements .",
    "furthermore , the incorporation of the three - body scattering dynamics at shorter distances brings about intrinsic practical disadvantages as compared to an approach where @xmath106 are constant ( this approach is usually called three - body coulomb wave method , 3c ) .",
    "namely , the construction of @xmath113 has to be individually undertaken for given charge and mass states of the specific three particle system at hand .",
    "this is comprehensible since properties of the total potential are inherent to the particular three - body system under investigation .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the normalization of the 3c wave function is readily determined from the asymptotic flux .",
    "this procedure has not been accessible in the case of @xmath113 due to the position dependence of @xmath106 .    to overcome this difficulty ( and that associated with the six - dimensional numerical integration when evaluating transition matrix elements ) we note that the position dependence of @xmath114 occurs ( due to dimensionality considerations ) through ratios of the interparticle distances .",
    "thus , this dependence can be converted into velocity dependence by assuming that @xmath115 the proportionality constant in eq .",
    "( [ prop ] ) could be of an arbitrary functional dependence . it should be emphasized that the approximation ( [ prop ] ) is not a classical one , i.  e. it is not assumed that the particles motions proceed along classical trajectories [ conversely , if the motion were classically free , eq .",

    "we assess the analytical methods developed above by performing a numerical evaluation of many - body scattering amplitudes .",
    "the reaction we are considering here is the electron - impact ionization of atomic hydrogen . in the final channel of this collision process two interacting electrons move in the double continuum of a residual ion .",
    "hence a correlated three - body wave function is needed to represent this state . for this wave function",

    "a method which is widely used in theoretical physics is the green function approach which we will follow up in this section .    for a canonical ensemble",
    ", we seek a non - perturbative method which allows to @xmath108 distribute systematically the total energy between the potential and the kinetic energy parts .",
    "this is achieved by the development of an incremental method in which the @xmath0 correlated particle system is mapped exactly onto a set of systems in which only @xmath289 particles are interacting ( @xmath290 $ ] ) , i.e. in which the potential energy part is damped .",
    "( in contrast to re - normalization group theory we do not reduce the strength of interactions , but the number of them ) .",
    "this is particularly interesting from a thermodynamic point of view since for a number of thermodynamic properties the kinetic energy contributions can be separated out from the potential energy parts , as shown in the next section for the internal energy . by virtue of the present method the potential energy part is systematically reduced .    for",
    "a formal development let us consider a nonrelativistic system consisting of @xmath0 interacting particles .",
    "we assume the total potential to be of the class @xmath291 without any further specification of the individual potentials @xmath292 . for three - body potentials the development of the theory proceeds along the same lines .",
    "+ the potential @xmath293 satisfies the recurrence relations @xmath294 where @xmath295 is the total potential of a system of @xmath181 interacting particles in which the @xmath189 particle is missing , i.e.  in terms of the physical pair potentials @xmath296 , one can write @xmath297 .    the fundamental quantity that describes the microscopic properties of the @xmath0 body quantum system is the green operator @xmath298 which is the resolvent of the total hamiltonian .",
    "it can be deduced from the lippmann schwinger equation @xmath299 where @xmath300 is the green operator of the non interacting @xmath0 body system .",
    "an equivalent approach to determine the dynamical behavior of a system is to derive the respective transition operator @xmath301 which satisfies the integral equation @xmath302 .",
    "these integral equations for @xmath298 and @xmath301 provide a natural framework for perturbative treatments .",
    "however , for @xmath303 the application of the above lippmann schwinger equations ( and those for the state vectors ) is hampered by mainly two difficulties : 1 . ) as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite the lippmann schwinger equations for the state vectors do not have a unique solution , and 2 . )",
    "as shown by faddeev @xcite the kernel of these integral equations @xmath304 is not a square integrable operator for @xmath303 , i.e.   the norm @xmath305^{1/2}$ ] is not square integrable .",
    "the kernel @xmath306 is also not compact .",
    "the reason for this drawback is the occurrence of the so - called disconnected diagrams where one of the @xmath0 particles is a spectator , i.e. not correlated with the other @xmath181 particles .",
    "for the three - body problem faddeev @xcite suggested alternative integral equations with square integrable kernel .",
    "our aim here is twofold : * ( a ) * we would like to derive non - perturbative integral equations that treat all @xmath0 particles on equal footing and are free from disconnected diagrams . *",
    "( b ) * these equations should allow to obtain , in a computationally accessible manner , the solution of the correlated @xmath0 body problem from the solution when only @xmath289 particles are interacting ( where @xmath290 $ ] ) .    according to the decomposition ( [ un ] ) , the integral equation for the transition operator can be written as @xmath307.\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{tn1 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we introduced the scaled potential @xmath308    the transition operator of the system , when @xmath181 particles are interacting via the scaled potential @xmath309 , is @xmath310    with this relation eq.([tn1 ] ) can be reformulated as @xmath311 eq.([ex ] ) can be expressed in a matrix form as follows @xmath312 \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } t^{(n-1)}_1 \\\\ t^{(n-1)}_2\\\\",

    "we conclude that the green operator of the interacting @xmath0 particle system has the form @xmath320 the operators @xmath321 are related to the green operators @xmath322 of the systems in which only @xmath181 particles are correlated by virtue of @xmath323 .",
    "this interrelation is given via @xmath324 \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } g^{(n-1)}_1 \\\\",
    "g^{(n-1)}_2\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ g^{(n-1)}_{n-1}\\\\ g^{(n-1)}_{n } \\end{array}\\right ) , \\label{expang}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath325 = g_0[{\\bf \\tilde k}^{(n-1 ) } ] g_0^{-1}$ ] . from eqs.([expan],[expang",
    "] ) we conclude that if the green operator of the interacting @xmath181 body system is known ( from other analytical or numerical procedures , e.g. from an effective field method , such as density functional theory ) the green operator of the @xmath0 particles can then be deduced by solving a set of @xmath0 linear , coupled integral equations ( namely eqs.([expan],[expang ] ) ) . according to the above equations , if only the solution of the @xmath289 problem is known where @xmath326 $ ] we have to perform a hierarchy of calculations starting by obtaining the solution for the @xmath327 problem and repeating the procedure to reach the solution of the @xmath0 body problem .    at first sight the kernels of eqs .",
    "( [ expan],[expang ] ) appear to have disconnected diagrams since they contain transition operators of systems where only @xmath181 particles are interacting and one particle is free ( disconnected ) .",
    "it is , however , straightforward to show that any iteration of these kernels is free of disconnected terms ( the disconnected terms occurs only in the off - diagonal elements of @xmath328 $ ] and @xmath329 $ ] ) . for @xmath330",
    "the present scheme reduces to the well - established faddeev equations . as for the functional structure of the eqs .",
    "( [ expan],[expang ] ) we remark that for the solution of the @xmath0 particle problem we need the ( off - shell ) transition operators of the @xmath181 subsystem .",
    "the interaction potentials do not appear in this formulation ( in contrast to the lippmann schwinger approach ) .",
    "on the other hand the ( on - shell ) transition matrix elements can be determined experimentally .",
    "this fact becomes valuable when the potentials are not known .      over the years",
    "a substantial body of knowledge on the three - particle problem has been accumulated .",
    "in contrast , theoretical studies on the four - body problem are still scare due to computational limitations whereas an impressive amount of experimental data is already available @xcite .",
    "thus , it is desirable to apply the above procedure to the four - body system and to express its solution in terms of known solutions of the three - body problem .",
    "for @xmath331 the first iteration of eq.([expang ] ) yields @xmath332 here @xmath333 is the green operator of the system where only three particles are interacting and can be taken from other numerical or analytical studies .",
    "this means , to a first order , methods treating the correlated three - body problem can be extended to deal with the four - body case using eq.([g4 ] ) .",
    "we note that for the case of non - interacting system @xmath333 reduces to @xmath334 and hence eq.([g4 ] ) reduces to @xmath335 , as expected .",
    "the green function encompasses the complete spectrum of the many - body system , i.e.  the wave function approach can be retrieved from the green function .",
    "for example , eq.([g4 ] ) leads to an expression for the four - body state vector in the form @xmath336 here @xmath337 is the state vector of the system in which the three particles @xmath338 and @xmath25 are interacting whereas @xmath339 is the state vector of the non - interacting four - body system .",
    "the state vectors @xmath337 can be approximated by eq.([ds3c ] ) or by the other procedures discussed in the preceding section on the three - body problem .",
    "since the state vector ( [ psi ] ) is expressed as a sum of correlated three - body states , the evaluation of the four - body transition matrix elements for a specific reaction simplifies considerably .",
    "in addition , the spectral properties of a many - body interacting system can be obtained in a straightforward way from those for systems with a reduced number of interactions , for in this case the matrix elements of the total green functions are expressed as sums of matrix elements of reduced green functions , as evident from eq.([g4 ] ) .",
    "this spectral feature can be exploited to study the thermodynamical properties of finite correlated systems .",
    "to investigate the thermodynamical properties of @xmath0 interacting particle system we remark that at the critical point divergent thermodynamical quantities , such as the specific heat @xmath340 are obtained as a derivative with respect to the inverse temperature @xmath341 of the logarithm of the canonical partition function @xmath342 , @xmath343 here @xmath344 is some analytical function and for the boltzmann constant we assume @xmath345 .",
    "therefore divergences in the thermodynamic quantities , which signify phase transitions are connected to the zero points of @xmath342 .",
    "these zero points are generally complex valued",
    ". therefore an analytical continuation of @xmath342 to complex temperatures is needed .",
    "the connection between the phase transitions and the complex zero points of the grand canonical partition function have been uncovered by yang and lee @xcite . in this case one",
    "seeks an analytical continuation of the fugacity @xmath346 ( here @xmath7 is the chemical potential ) to the complex plane @xmath347 . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "the zero points condense to lines .",
    "the transition points are the crossing points of these lines with the real fugacity axis .",
    "grossman _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite generalized the concept of yang and lee to the canonical ensemble . in this case",
    "the inverse temperature @xmath348 is continued analytically to @xmath349 .",
    "the phase transitions are then the crossings of the zero points line of @xmath342 with the real @xmath341 axis .",
    "the advantage here is that a classification of the phase transitions can be given in terms of how the zero - points line do cross the real @xmath341 axis @xcite .",
    "the crucial point is that in the thermodynamic limit @xmath350 and @xmath351 ( @xmath352 is the volume ) the zero points approach , to an infinitesimal small distance the real axis .",
    "for this reason , the characteristic phase - transition divergences appear in the thermodynamical quantities . for finite systems",
    "@xmath342 has only finite zero points that do not approach infinitely close the real axis .",
    "therefore , the thermodynamic quantities show smooth peaks rather then divergences .",
    "the positions and widths of these peaks can be obtained from the real and imaginary parts of the zero points laying closest to the real axis @xcite .    to apply this method to correlated finite systems we need a representation of the canonical partition function that can then be continued analytically to the complex temperature plane .",
    "the canonical partition function of a correlated system can be expressed in terms of the many - body green function as @xmath353 here @xmath354 is the density of states which is related to imaginary part of the trace of @xmath298 via @xmath355 from the green function expansion eq.([greenn ] ) we deduce @xmath356 where @xmath357 to a first order @xmath358 where @xmath359 is the partition function of a system in which only @xmath181 particles are interacting . for the applications of the grossmann method let us remark that @xmath342 is an integral function and can be expressed in a polynomial form . recalling the analytical properties of meromorphic functions one can write @xmath342 in terms of its complex zero points as @xmath360",
    "in conclusions we reviewed recent advances in the analytical treatment of correlated few charged - particle systems . starting from the two - body ( kepler ) problem we discussed the mathematical and physical properties of a three - body system above the complete fragmentation threshold .",
    "analytical approximate expressions for the three - body wave functions have been derived and employed for the calculations of transition matrix elements in atomic scattering experiments .",
    "the discussion has been extended to the case of @xmath0 charged particles in the continuum where @xmath0 particle wave functions have been derived and their mathematical features have been exposed . for the description of the complete spectrum of a general finite system we discussed a green function method that maps the @xmath0 interacting particle system onto a system with a less number of interactions . a brief account has been given on how this method can be used to investigate thermodynamic properties of finite systems .",
    "the application of the green function method for the calculations of scattering amplitudes have been presented in ref.@xcite .",
