    "integrable probabilistic systems are broadly characterized by two properties :    1 .",
    "it is possible to write down concise and exact formulas for expectations of a variety of interesting observables of the system .",
    "asymptotics of the system , observable and associated formulas provide access to exact descriptions of new phenomena as well as large universality classes .    in light of these properties",
    ", there are two main goals in this area :    1 .",
    "build bridges between algebraic structures and probabilistic systems and in so doing , discover new integrable probabilistic systems and new tools by which to analyze them .",
    "2 .   study scaling limits of these integrable probabilistic systems and in so doing , expand and refine the scope of their associated universality classes and discover new asymptotic phenomena displayed by these systems .",
    "in this paper we work to advance the first goal .",
    "we develop a four - parameter family of stochastic interacting particle systems which are built off of higher spin representations of the six - vertex model @xmath1-matrix .",
    "these systems benefit from properties inherited from the @xmath1-matrix . in particular , they are diagonalizable explicitly in terms of a complete set of bethe ansatz eigenfunctions , and they also enjoy certain markov dualities .",
    "we use these two facts to compute moment and then laplace - type transform formulas for these processes .",
    "asymptotics of these systems and the associated exact formulas are in line with the second goal defined above .",
    "we do not pursue this here , but note that such asymptotics have previously been performed on various degenerations of this family of systems @xcite . in all of those cases ,",
    "the resulting phenomena were that of the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) universality class .",
    "it would be quite interesting to see whether other phenomena can be accessed beyond that of the kpz class .",
    "vertex models and more generally quantum integrable systems have long been objects of intense research within mathematics and physics ( see , for example , the reviews @xcite ) . generally , @xmath1-matrices are not stochastic , and nor are their associated transfer matrices . here",
    "we work with an @xmath1-matrix which is stochastic ( and arises from conjugating the associated transfer matrix ) .",
    "this enables us to define our vertex models on the entire line such as in @xcite .",
    "the associated transfer matrix is bethe ansatz diagaonalizable , as follows either from taking a limit of the finite lattice algebraic bethe ansatz or from the recent work @xcite .",
    "moreover , as opposed to on a finite lattice , there are relatively simple direct and inverse transforms with respect to these bethe ansatz eigenfunctions @xcite ( see also appendix [ sec : bethe ] ) .",
    "our proofs of duality are largely based on earlier methods from @xcite . in both cases ( diagonalization and duality )",
    "we first prove our results for the horizontal spin @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and arbitrary vertical spin @xmath1-matrix .",
    "then we construct higher horizontal spin @xmath1-matrices ( @xmath4 ) via markov functions theory , and the diagonalization and duality easily extends .",
    "this construction provides a probabilistic proof of the fusion of @xmath1-matrices on the line .",
    "though initially the form of the @xmath1-matrix we find is not very explicit , we are able to demonstrate a recursion relation it satisfies , and then explicitly solve that in terms of @xmath0-racah polynomials @xcite .",

    "( @xmath0-tasep ) are both one - parameter generalizations of tasep or @xmath0 to zero , and from @xmath0-tasep by setting @xmath0 to zero . ] . in @xcite",
    "it was recognized that both systems enjoy markov dualities and have moment formulas which can be written in terms of nested contour integrals .",
    "this prompted the question of whether both systems and their associated results can be united as special cases of a more general integrable probabilistic system . in @xcite",
    "this question was addressed at a spectral level  it was shown that the eigenfunctions which diagonalize both systems are special cases of a more general set of eigenfunctions ( recalled in appendix  [ sec : bethe ] ) . in this present work",
    "we provide a complete answer to this question in the affirmative .",
    "the four - parameter family of systems we introduce here have degenerations to both asep and @xmath0-tasep , at the level of their transition operators .",
    "in other words , not only do the eigenfunctions degenerate , but so do the eigenvalues .    in recent work , @xcite discovered a family of higher spin particle systems which interpolate from asep ( spin @xmath2 ) to @xmath0-tasep ( spin infinity ) and proved dualities for these systems using @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "this two - parameter family of systems being the two parameters . ] does not appear to be diagonalizable via bethe ansatz except for the cases of asep and @xmath0-tasep .",
    "hence it is unclear whether many of the nice properties of asep and @xmath0-tasep hold for the systems in between them . besides the cases of asep and @xmath0-tasep , the systems and dualities proved in @xcite appear to be different than any degenerations of our four - parameter family of systems .",
    "besides asep and @xmath0-tasep , our family of particle systems has a number of other interesting degenerations .",
    "some of this hierarchy of degenerations is illustrated in figure [ fig : diagramofprocesses ] wherein we show the relations to various known systems in the literature .",
    "there are , of course , many other degenerations to study . the exact nature of the degenerations are indicated below or in the cited literature .",

    "besides these examples , there are also ` determinantal ' particle systems ( such as tasep ) which fall into the hierarchy of degenerations and are not depicted .",
    "let us note that the log - gamma polymer @xcite , @xmath0-pushasep @xcite , and two - sided @xmath0-hahn asep @xcite are not included in figure [ fig : diagramofprocesses ] .",
    "these systems are all diagonalized in the same basis ( or degenerations thereof ) as our four - parameter family of systems , and they have explicit and elementary eigenfunctions . while we expect that these systems can also be incorporated in some form into our hierarchy , we do not pursue this direction here and leave it for future work .",
