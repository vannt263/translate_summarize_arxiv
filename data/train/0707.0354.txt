    "we consider homogeneous nuclear matter at low density so that two - body correlations dominate .",
    "of course , at very low density , clustering phenomena can occur , like deuteron , tritium , helium and alpha particle formation @xcite .",
    "therefore , we are going to consider densities which are low with respect to saturation density , but still large compared to typical values where the onset of clustering occurs .",
    "typically , we are considering densities between about one tenth to one half of the saturation density . in this density region , microscopic calculations based on the relativistic dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) approach @xcite are expected to be quite accurate , and they will be , therefore , the starting point of our analysis .        in the relativistic brueckner approach",
    "the nucleon inside the medium is dressed by the self - energy @xmath3 .",
    "the in - medium t - matrix which is obtained from the relativistic bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation plays the role of an effective two - body interaction which contains all short - range and many - body correlations of the ladder approximation . solving the bs - equation the pauli principle is respected and intermediate scattering states are projected out of the fermi sea .",
    "the summation of the t - matrix over the occupied states inside the fermi sea yields finally the self - energy in hartree - fock approximation .",
    "this coupled set of equations states a self - consistency problem which has to be solved by iteration .",
    "technical details of the present dbhf calculations , in particular the treatment of isospin asymmetry , can be found in @xcite .",

    "it shows in addition the equations - of - state obtained by two typical phenomenological relativistic mean field models . from the microscopic side",
    "these are the dbhf results @xcite which will be further analyzed , non - relativistic brueckner ( bhf ) calculations from @xcite and variational calculations from @xcite .",
    "the variational and bhf calculations are based on the @xmath4 argonne potential .",
    "the variational calculations include in addition phenomenological 3-body - forces ( urbana ix ) and relativistic boost corrections which both do , however , not play an important role in the low density regime .",
    "the phenomenological models are the well established nl3 @xcite relativistic mean field ( rmf ) parametrisation and the rmf model of @xcite ( dd - tw ) .",
    "the latter is a phenomenological version of density dependent rmf theory using density dependent meson - nucleon couplings @xcite which allows for a larger freedom in the adjustment of the eos .",
    "both approaches fit finite nuclei properties with high accuracy .",
    "the first what becomes evident from fig .",
    "( [ fig01 ] ) is the remarkable agreement of the microscopic approaches ( dbhf , bhf , variational ) concerning the pure neutron matter eos .",
    "this indicates that both , the interaction and the many - body schemes are well controlled in the @xmath5 sector at low densities .",
    "the reason is on the one handside the large @xmath5 scattering length and on the other side the lack of clustering phenomena ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 etc ) which make the treatment of neutron matter at subnuclear densities less model dependent . in this context",
    "it is worth noticing that the microscopic calculations ( bhf / dbhf , variational ) are consistent with the low density limit of exact quantum - monte - carlo calculations for neutron matter @xcite and with the result of the renormalization group @xmath8 approach @xcite .",
    "the situation seems to be different for symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the brueckner calculations show significantly more binding than the variational calculations of @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the dbhf and bhf results are very close and exhibit the same low density behavior : in contrast to rmf theory and also to @xcite one can observe a non - linear convergence to zero when the density decreases .",
    "this fact is associated to the deuteron channel and can possibly be interpreted as a manifestation of the onset of the super - fluid phase . in this context",
    "it is interesting to note that a recent study of low density nuclear matter @xcite , based on a virial expansion which includes protons , neutrons and @xmath7-particle degrees of freedom , revealed a low density eos which is in qualitative agreement with the dbhf predictions . in the virial approach",
    "the binding energy goes smoothly to zero for neutron matter while the energy per particle @xmath9 minus the ( free ) kinetic energy in symmetric matter remains practically constant at a value around -8 mev down to extremely low densities ( @xmath10 ) before it rapidly drops to zero ( fig .",

    "[ figu04 ] the contribution of the different terms of the functional up to the power 4 in the densities .",

    "( [ edens1])-([u1 ] ) will be used to fit the result of the dbhf calculation  @xcite and to calculate the spinodal instabilities in low density asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "in this section , we fit the result of the dbhf calculation ( dirac mass , energy density and binding energies ) in the density region between 0.01 and 0.2 @xmath2 using the low density rmf functional defined in eqs .",
    "( [ edens1])-([u1 ] ) .",
    "the fits are based on the density expansion of the rmf lagrangian ( [ eq:1 ] ) which contains non - linear terms in the scalar @xmath14 field and linear terms in the vector field @xmath15 as well as in the isovector @xmath17 and @xmath16 fields .",
    "an alternative would be to perform such a parametrisation of the dbhf results in terms of density dependent relativistic hadron theory ( ddrh )  @xcite where non - linearity s due to higher order density corrections are absorbed into density dependent meson - nucleon vertices at the level of the effective lagrangian .",
    "the reason why we have chosen the standard rmf lagrangian ( [ eq:1 ] ) is twofold : this allows a well defined low - density expansion while the density dependence of effective meson - nucleon vertices in ddrh depends on the choice of an particular ansatz for these functionals .",
    "secondly , the extraction of such coupling functions from the present dbhf self - energies  @xcite shows that the dbhf vector self - energy , except for the very low density regime , has a linear density dependence which can be expressed by a linear @xmath15 meson field .",
    "non - linearities in the scalar channel are absorbed in the non - linear @xmath14 terms .",
    "the isovector dependence can also reasonably well be fitted through the two isovector @xmath17 and @xmath16 mesons . in summary ,",
    "such a procedure allows a well defined comparison of the microscopic dbhf model to rmf phenomenology and a controlled investigation of the low density regime , where the rmf fits break down and require additional correction terms , as will be seen in the following .",
    "the adjusting procedure is twofold : firstly , we fit the parameters of the rmf lagrangian using the relativistic dirac mass and the energy density in symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter obtained from the dbhf calculation .",
    "the fit includes 23 calculated points between @xmath55=0.02 and 0.13  @xmath2 , plus two densities , @xmath55=0.1658  @xmath2 and @xmath55=0.197  @xmath2 , for @xmath56=0 to 0.5 with a step=0.05 .",
    "we obtain the set of parameters called rmf presented in tab .",
    "[ table:1 ] , by fitting the dirac mass and the density of energy and imposing that the functional passes exactly through the point at @xmath57 @xmath2 in symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter .",
    "the latter condition is imposed in order to get a value of the symmetry energy close to dbhf , as shown in tab .",
    "[ table:5 ] .",
    "then , we extract and fit the residual difference between the dbhf calculation and the energy per particle in symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter separately . in order to check the sensitivity of the results on the functional correction ,",
    "we have investigated two different functionals . in the following",
    ", we give the details of the adjusting procedure .",
    ".the parameters of the functional reproducing the scalar mass and the energy density of the dbhf calculation is compared to the parameters proposed in ref  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in this context it is worth to mention that rmf fits to finite nuclei require relatively high compression moduli @xmath58 mev  @xcite .",
    "equations of state with a stiff high density behavior stand , however , in contrast to the information extracted from heavy ion reactions  @xcite .",
    "the pure rmf fits to the dbhf eos , i.e. discarding the low density correction term , provide equations of state which are stiff , however , not due to their high density behavior but do to the low density part .",
    "the compression moduli of the pure rmf contributions without correction term are k=365  mev in contrast to the soft dbhf eos with k=230  mev .",
    "if one assumes that the correction terms contain effectively contributions from the deuteron and/or reflect the precursor of a superfluid low density state which leads to additional binding in infinite matter , but plays no substantial role in finite nuclei , this could explain the discrepancy between the eos obtained from rmf fits to finite nuclei and that predicted by dbhf or the a low density virial expansion  @xcite .",
    "let us consider asymmetric nuclear matter characterized by a proton and a neutron densities @xmath59 @xmath60 , @xmath61 . in infinite matter ,",
    "the extensively of the free energy implies that it can be reduced to a free energy density  : @xmath62 the system is stable against separation into two phases if the free energy of a single phase is lower than the free energy in all two - phases configurations .",

    "the contour for the rmf functional is very similar to the one obtained previously with non - relativistic interactions  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , spinodal densities are a little bit larger .",
    "indeed , in mean - field models , it is well known that the spinodal density in symmetric nuclear matter scales with the saturation density  @xcite .",
    "the spinodal densities we obtain is just due to a scaling effect induced by the saturation density which is slightly to large for the functional rmf .",

    "is reduced by about 15 - 20% .    in usual mean field calculations , it has been found that the direction of the unstable mode is still isoscalar in asymmetric nuclear matter  @xcite . as the spinodal contour calculated with the functionals rmf+c1 and rmf+c2 differs significantly from the functional rmf",
    ", one could wonder what would be the consequences for the unstable mode : still isoscalar or possibly isovector ?",

    "for the three functionals ( rmf , rmf+c1 and rmf+c2 ) the unstable mode is included in between the isoscalar direction and the direction @xmath88=cst .",
    "however , the results obtained with the functionals rmf+c1 and rmf+c2 are very similar and differ from the one obtained with the functional rmf .",
    "indeed , for the functionals rmf+c1 and rmf+c2 , the unstable mode is less isoscalar than the one calculated with the functional rmf , hence , the fractionation mechanism should be less pronounced than the one predicted with mean - field models  @xcite .",
    "the gas phase should then be less asymmetric than what was previously predicted based on mean - field calculations .     with the density for asymmetries ranging from @xmath88=0.1 to 0.5 .",
    "we have obtained two functionals which give a very good description of the dbhf calculations in asymmetric nuclear matter .",

    "furthermore effective terms are added which account for effects beyond mean field like the deuteron pole .",
    "this parametrisation has been used to understand the topological properties of the energy density , like the spinodal zone .",
    "we have observed that the spinodal zone is reduced in asymmetric nuclear matter contrarily to all the previous mean - field calculation .",
    "based on the analysis of the direction of the unstable mode , it is shown that the gas phase could be less asymmetric than what was previously predicted based on mean - field calculations .",
    "this calculation has been performed at zero temperature while experiments probe the liquid - gas phase transition near the critical temperature  @xcite .",
    "an extension of this work to finite temperature is then necessary , but one could expect from mean field calculations that the critical density scales with the spinodal density @xmath91 . in a future work , it would then be interesting to evaluate the effects of the two - body correlations at finite temperature .    as a final conclusion and outlook of this work , we would like to stress that the low density eos is required for both heavy ion collisions as well as for the description of the crust of neutron stars where a low density neutron gas is formed .",

    "<S> asymmetric nuclear matter is investigated in the low density region below the nuclear saturation density . </S>",
    "<S> microscopic calculations based on the dirac brueckner hartree - fock ( dbhf ) approach with realistic nucleon - nucleon potentials are used to adjust a low density functional . </S>",
    "<S> this functional is constructed on a density expansion of the relativistic mean field theory which allows a clear interpretation of the role of the mesons to the equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that a correction term should be added to the functional in order to take into account the effects beyond the mean field . </S>",
    "<S> two functionals with different corrections are obtained and their topological properties has been studied . </S>",
    "<S> those functionals converge to predict a reduction of the spinodal zone in asymmetric nuclear matter by about 15 - 20% and an isoscalar unstable mode closer to the constant z / a direction than the functional without correction .    </S>",
    "<S> how does nuclear matter properties change when the density decreases from saturation densities ? in this low density regime , what is the role of the isospin asymmetry ? </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the nuclear density functional below saturation density has not been much studied while it has an importance for several topics concerning atomic nuclei surface properties , the equation of state of the core of neutron stars and for the dynamical description of heavy ion collision , both at intermediate and relativistic energies . </S>",
    "<S> recently , several attempts have tried to establish a relation between the low density equation of state and the nuclear properties like surface behavior and pairing properties   @xcite , neutron radii  @xcite or the spinodal instability  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> those works are based on phenomenological density functionals or fits of ab - initio calculations but without considering the very low properties of the equation of state . below saturation density , </S>",
    "<S> effects of two - body correlations are important and induce anomalies in the density dependence of the equation of state @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> models which make predictions for the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) can roughly be divided into three classes : phenomenological density functionals , effective field theory approaches , and ab initio approaches . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenological density functionals are based on effective density dependent interactions such as gogny or skyrme forces @xcite or relativistic mean field ( rmf ) models @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> parameters are adjusted to nuclear bulk properties and finite nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> effective field theory ( eft ) approaches are based on a perturbative expansion of the nucleon - nucleon interaction or the nuclear mean field within power counting schemes . </S>",
    "<S> these approaches lead to a more systematic expansion of the eos in powers of density , respectively the fermi momentum @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the eft approaches can be based on density functional theory  @xcite or e.g. on chiral perturbation theory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of eft is the small number of free parameters and a correspondingly higher predictive power . </S>",
    "<S> however , when high precision fits are intended , the eft functionals are based on approximately the same number of model parameters as phenomenological density functionals due to fine tuning through additional parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> ab initio approaches are based on high precision free space nucleon - nucleon interactions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , predictions for the nuclear eos are parameter free . </S>",
    "<S> examples of such approaches are variational calculations @xcite , brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) @xcite or relativistic dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) @xcite calculations and green function monte - carlo approaches ( gfmc ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> non - relativistic ab initio calculations do not meet the empirical region of saturation , whereas relativistic calculations do a better job . </S>",
    "<S> this deficiency can be solved by the explicit inclusion of three - body forces where the relativistic approach accounts already effectively for part of these contributions . for a more detailed discussion </S>",
    "<S> see e.g. ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in the present work microscopic calculations based on the dbhf approach  @xcite using a realistic nucleon - nucleon potential , i.e. the bonn a interaction @xcite , are used to obtain a functional which describes the equation of state from low densities up to saturation density . </S>",
    "<S> the construction of this functional is motivated by relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory  @xcite . since both , dbhf and rmf are relativistic approaches based dirac phenomenology they have similar features , in particular the occurrence of large and cancellating scalar and vector fields in the isoscalar sector . that the occurrence of such fields is a fundamental consequence of the elementary nuclear force has recently been shown in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar fields , which are , however , smaller , occur also in the isovector sector . thus , rmf theory is well suited for the present investigations . </S>",
    "<S> however , rmf theory is insufficient to reproduce the more complex nonlinear behavior of the dbhf energy density near @xmath1 @xmath2 , where for instance effects of the deuteron pole show up . </S>",
    "<S> corrections beyond mean field are necessary and the non - linear behavior is then corrected in adding new terms in the functional .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows : the relativistic dbhf is shortly sketched in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : rba ] . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : sebd ] is devoted to the relativistic mean - field approach and the series expansion in the baryonic density . </S>",
    "<S> this expansion allows a clear interpretation of the meson contributions to the equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of the functionals are obtained in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : param ] . with these density functionals </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the liquid - gas transition induced by heavy ion collision at fermi energies , i.e. the spinodal instabilities , are investigated and analyzed in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : si ] . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we end with a conclusion in sec .  </S>",
