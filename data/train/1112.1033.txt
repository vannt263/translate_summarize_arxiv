    "observational @xmath0-ray astronomy got a massive boost after the launch of the fermi gamma - ray space telescope ( fermi ) on 11th june , 2008 . the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard fermi provides an increase in sensitivity by more than an order of magnitude over egret and agile .",
    "the origin of extragalactic @xmath0-ray background ( egrb ) is one of the fundamental unsolved problem in astrophysics .",
    "egrb can arise from some diffuse processes like black hole evaporation , large scale structure formation , matter - antimatter annihilation , etc ( e.g. , @xcite ) . alternatively ,",
    "due to the limited instrument sensitivity , unresolved @xmath0-ray sources could contribute significantly to the observed egrb .",
    "recently , the egrb has been rederived from fermi large area telescope ( lat ) data @xcite .",
    "egrb is consistent with a featureless power law of index @xmath1 .",
    "the integrated flux above @xmath2 mev is @xmath3 photon @xmath4 s@xmath5 sr@xmath5 .",
    "fermi already detected @xmath6 sources in 11 months of observation ( first fermi catalog ; @xcite ) and is expected to detect many more .",
    "in contrast to the less than @xmath2 active galactic nuclei ( agns ) in the egret catalog , the first fermi - lat agn catalog @xcite consist of @xmath7 blazars .",
    "fermi also detected 11 non - blazar agn @xcite , three normal ( m @xmath8 , lmc and milky way ) and two starburst galaxies ( m @xmath9 and ngc @xmath10 ) .",
    "thus , fermi provides an excellent opportunity to understand the origin of egrb .",
    "since the dominant class of identified egret and",
    "fermi sources are blazars , they are expected to contribute to the egrb .",
    "the contribution from blazars to the egrb is estimated using two different approaches : ( a ) considering a relationship between the blazar @xmath0-ray luminosity with their luminosity at some other wavelength , their @xmath0-ray luminosity function is assumed to be the scaled luminosity function at that wavelength ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "( b ) constructing the @xmath0-ray luminosity function directly from observed @xmath0-ray blazars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in an earlier work @xcite following a similar approach of @xcite but with almost twice the number of sources , we constructed the @xmath0-ray luminosity functions of flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and bl lacs from egret - detected sources only .",
    "we found strong positive evolution for fsrqs , while bl lacs did not show any significant evolution . the maximum contribution from blazars to egrb",
    "was found to be @xmath11% .",
    "however , due to the limited number of sources in the egret catalog , the luminosity function and hence , the contribution from blazars was not well constrained .",
    "@xcite estimated the contribution from fsrqs and bl lacs to the egrb in the context of agn unification paradigm , and found that unresolved blazars ( both `` aligned '' and `` misaligned '' ) contribute @xmath12 to the egrb . in a similar approach , @xcite estimated that fsrqs and bl lacs contribute @xmath13% and @xmath14 at @xmath15 gev respectively .",
    "from the first three months of fermi observation , abdo et al .",
    "@xcite found that fsrqs exhibit strong evolution while bl lacs show no evolution . using the 1st fermi catalog",
    ", @xcite found from the source count distribution that the point source contribution is @xmath16 of the egrb .    here",
    ", we construct the luminosity function of fsrqs and bl lacs following the methodology described in @xcite . utilizing the fermi observed sources we construct a complete source list ,",
    "apply the @xmath17 method to search for the presence of evolution , find parameters by modified @xmath17 method , and finally construct the luminosity function using @xmath18 method and maximum likelihood estimator .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the evolution of blazar source class .",
    "we discuss in section 3 the luminosity function construction of fsrqs .",
    "the methodology to calculate the misaligned blazars contribution to the egrb is given in section 4 .",
    "we conclude with our discussion in section 5 .",
    "we study the luminosity evolution of blazars by considering a sample that consists of sources from first lat agn catalog having @xmath19 or above detection significance with @xmath0-ray flux ( e @xmath20 mev ) @xmath21 @xmath22 ph @xmath4s@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite showed that fermi - lat detects spectrally hard sources at flux level generally fainter than those of soft sources .",
    "they showed that the lat sample ( including all sources ) is complete above @xmath23 ph @xmath4s@xmath5 ( figure 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , the maximum photon index for blazars is 2.98 , much lower than the maximum photon index of all sources of 1st fermi catalog , and from figure 1 of @xcite , one can see that the blazar sample is complete to a flux below @xmath23 ph @xmath4s@xmath5 . as a secondary check to the completeness of our sample above @xmath22 ph @xmath4s@xmath5",
    ", we performed the @xmath24 test of this sample and obtained @xmath24 that matches within @xmath25 of a sample of limiting flux @xmath23 ph @xmath4s@xmath5 .",
    "our sample consists of @xmath26 fsrqs . and @xmath27 bl lacs ( @xmath28 with known @xmath29 ) .",
    "the @xmath30 comes out to be @xmath31 , which indicates strong evolution . for bl lacs",
    "( with known @xmath29 sources only ) , @xmath32 comes out to be @xmath33 , which indicates no significant evolution .",
    "if we include the sources with unknown @xmath29 considering they are at the average @xmath29 of the sample , @xmath32 comes out to be @xmath34 . since",
    ", a good fraction of bl lacs in our sample do not have redshift information , it is not possible to construct a meaningful luminosity function of bl lacs at this moment .",
    "we consider both pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) and pure density evolution ( pde ) for fsrqs .     with evolution parameter @xmath35 .",

    "the modified @xmath24 method is used to find the evolution parameter . for the optimum parameter value",
    ", @xmath17 is expected to be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 , thus @xmath39 .",
    "we find @xmath40 .",
    "for each value of evolution parameter ( @xmath41 ) , the distribution of @xmath17 is compared with a uniform distribution using ks - test which shows distribution of @xmath17 is uniform for @xmath40 .",
    "the optimum value of @xmath42 is found to be @xmath43 .",
    "similarly , for pure density evolution , the parameter values of exponential and power law evolution models are , @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively .",

    "the values of @xmath49 for fsrqs and bl lacs are @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively .",
    "for pure luminosity evolution , after de - evolution of the sources at @xmath52 , we constructed their luminosity function by @xmath18 method which suggests a luminosity function described by a broken power law .",
    "we then used maximum likelihood function for the redshift distribution of sources , considering a broken power law luminosity function ,    @xmath53    here @xmath54 is the de - evolved luminosity function and @xmath55 is the normalization of the luminosity function .",
    "the break luminosity ( @xmath56 ) and the lower and upper end index ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively ) are constrained by maximizing the likelihood function .    for pure density evolution",
    ", we consider a similar form of luminosity function and constrained the parameters by maximizing the likelihood function for the redshift distribution of sources .",

    "according to the agn unification scenario , fr ii galaxies are the parent population of fsrqs whereas , fr i galaxies are the parent population of bl lacs .",
    "the agn jet emission is expected to fall very rapidly with increasing jet to line - of - sight angle . nevertheless ,",
    "considering the large population of these misaligned blazars compared to nearly - aligned ones , these sources could contribute significantly to egrb .",
    "fermi has already detected 11 misaligned blazars .",
    "the observed jet luminosity @xmath78 at a jet to line - of - sight angle ( @xmath79 ) can be written as @xmath80 from the knowledge of @xmath81 one can in principle , estimate the contribution from off - axis agns to the egrb .",
    "our aim is to model the sed of all fermi - detected off - axis sources using standard leptonic models with structured jets . from the knowledge of these sed modeling and vlbi observations",
    "one can fix the emission processes in the jet and other jet parameters and can construct @xmath81 .",
    "next step is to constrain @xmath81 by comparing @xmath0-ray detected misaligned blazars with equivalent on - axis objects ( by matching sources with similar jet power , @xmath82 ) and then validate our predictions by modeling few misaligned blazars that are not detected by fermi .    from the observed @xmath0-ray luminosities of off - axis sources and their jet inclination angle",
    "one can also construct @xmath81 .",
    "the difference in the observed @xmath0-ray luminosities between two radio galaxies can arise from two different reasons : a@xmath83 due to their different jet to line - of - sight angle , b@xmath83 due to their different intrinsic luminosities .",
    "if one considers that the total radio luminosity is a tracer of unbeamed luminosity , then after an appropriate scaling , one can construct @xmath81 from scaled @xmath0-ray luminosities and jet inclination angles of off - axis sources .",
    "we have initiated this work .",
    "our aim is to analyze fermi data to date on radio galaxies and model it to derive jet parameters .",
    "we have completed the analysis and the sed modeling of 3c111 and 3c120 ( figure [ fig - f4 ] shows the sed fitting of 3c 120 . )",
    "both the sources are well fitted with simple ssc emission model .",
    "@xmath82 is also @xmath845 for both the sources .",
    "using first fermi catalog , we investigated the luminosity function and nature of evolution of fsrqs and bl lacs separately in @xmath0-rays .",
    "the nature of evolution of fsrqs and bl lacs as found in this work , are in agreement with earlier works ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we considered both ple and pde models for fsrqs .",
    "both power law and exponential evolution functions have been considered .",
    "the luminosity function is considered to be of a broken power law form and the parameters are found using likelihood analysis . from this analysis",
    "it is not possible to strongly conclude on the true evolution model .",
    "fig [ fig - f3 ] suggests that pde model explains observations marginally better than that of ple model .",
    "in contrast to earlier works of determination of luminosity function from @xmath0-ray observations @xcite , our derived luminosity function is well constrained . in a recent work ,",
    "ajello et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the redshift of the peak in the number density of fsrqs is luminosity dependent .",
    "hence , they considered luminosity dependent density evolution for fsrqs ( similar to that of radio - quiet agn ) .",
