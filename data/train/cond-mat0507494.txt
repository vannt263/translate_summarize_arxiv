    "the one - band hubbard model is a generic model for interacting electrons in the narrow - band and strongly correlated systems @xcite .",
    "especially , since the high temperature superconductivity was discovered in the cuprates , the hubbard model on two - dimensional lattices as well as its strong coupling limit model @xcite , the t - j model , have been extensively studied in order to understand the various anomalous properties of the cuprate superconductor .",
    "the up - date investigations , however , can not supply a definitive evidence to show the stable @xmath4-wave superconducting ground state in these strongly correlated models @xcite .",
    "it was known that since the hubbard model for two - dimensions is not exactly solvable , using the hubbard model to study the exchange correlation of the system is difficult . on the other hand , the t - j model is weaker in studying the long range charge correlation because the on - site coulomb repulsion becomes trivial due to the non - doubly occupied projection . a better phenomenological model to include stronger correlations is the t - j - u model @xcite .",
    "the existence of both j- and u- terms is very important in a possible new mechanism of superconductivity , gossamer superconductivity , proposed by laughlin recently @xcite .",
    "both j and u appearing in the model has been argued to be the result of the correlations like charge transfer processes in the three band hubbard model @xcite .",
    "dealing with the three - band hubbard model , however , is very complicated and thus , the precise analytical deduction from the three band to single band hubbard models lacks .",
    "moreover , an exact reduction from the three band model to the single band with both j and u terms are more difficult .    in this paper",
    ", we would like to deal with the one - band hubbard model with a hopping asymmetry at finite u. in this case , since the on - site coulomb repulsion is not infinite , there may be a fraction of the lattice sites doubly occupied by electrons .",
    "thus , the u - term is non - trivial but can be exactly treated .",
    "the difficulty is to deal with the kinetic term .",
    "we will present a variational monte carlo calculation for the hubbard model in a two - dimensional square lattice .",
    "we examine two types of variational wave functions , the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) wave function and anti - ferromagnetic - rvb ( af - rvb ) coexisted wave function .",
    "there are many variational wave functions , including af , rvb and af - rvb , due to different kind of approximation .",
    "the early studies shows that the results of af and rvb were contradictory but the af - rvb had lower energy@xcite .",
    "so it is quite reasonable to consider the af - rvb wave function .",
    "however , the mean field studies prefer rvb@xcite .",
    "so we included rvb in our work that it might get a comparison with the mean field studies .",
    "it is found that the rvb state has a lower variational energy for smaller @xmath0 and @xmath2 which is the hopping amplitude changing the local double occupation while the af - rvb state is favorite for larger @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "for both wave functions , we check their phase structures .",
    "both wave functions have a crossover from metal to insulator states as @xmath5 tends to infinity . on the other hand",
    ", there is an ambiguity to find an optimal variational paring parameter @xmath6 describing the rvb feature of the states . in a wide range from @xmath7 to 1 ,",
    "the variational energies are almost degenerate for the lattice size in our calculation .",
    "this leads to a difficulty to identify if the metal state is either fermi liquid or @xmath4-wave superconducting .    to understand the physics in the crossover regime more clearly",
    ", we study an effective model which includes the contribution up to the second order of @xmath3 . moreover , the experience in the t - j model taught us , if there is a spin exchange term in the hamiltonian , the pairing variational parameter is much easier to be optimized @xcite . for a large u",
    ", the spin exchange may be explicitly shown by considering the virtual hopping of electron between two single occupied sites .",
    "a hopping term changing the double - occupancy may be taken as a perturbation as that in deducing the t - j model from the single band hubbard model . in the perturbative deduction from the hubbard model to the t - j model",
    ", we see that the j - term is actually from the second order perturbation in @xmath3 by taking the off - diagonal term for the double - occupied number in the kinetic term as the perturbation hamiltonian .",
    "namely , if the t - term is decomposed into @xmath8 , the perturbation process transfers @xmath9 to j - term , a virtual hopping process , and only @xmath10 serves as the real hopping @xcite .",
    "it can also clearly be seen from the canonical transformation deduction of the t - j model@xcite . in the present case",
    ", we can still have a j term as in the t - j model while the u term is kept due to a non - zero double - occupancy . in the t - j model , due to the no - double occupancy constraint",
    ", the kinetic term is a hopping between a single - occupied site to an empty site . for the present model , besides this hopping term , a hopping between double- and single - occupied sites and a pair hopping between the double - occupied and empty sites would be included .",
    "thus , we can derive an effective theory at large but finite u , which captures both the charge and exchange correlations of the system .",
    "we can have kinetic , j- and u- terms .",
    "however , it should not confuse with the t - j - u model mentioned above . in t - j - u model , the j is set as a free parameter that means j is independent of t and u@xcite .",
    "but in our case , j comes from the expansion of @xmath3 . in this effective theory",
    ", there is no a hopping term which changes the local double occupation .",
    "it is an extension of the t - j model with doubly - occupied sites .    to work out our model",
    ", we use the canonical transformation .",
    "we find that , to the second order of @xmath3 , the effective hamiltonian can be written as the sum over the hamiltonians acting on a subspace of the hilbert space with a fixed double occupied number @xmath11 .",
    "this fixed @xmath11 hamiltonian including three hopping terms which serve the electron hopping from single to empty sites ( @xmath12 term ) , double to single sites ( @xmath13 term ) , and the paring hopping ( @xmath14 term ) ; the u term and j - term as well as various nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "we also study the rvb and af - rvb variational wave functions for this effective model by the variational monte carlo method .",
    "the rvb state is in smaller @xmath15 and @xmath0 regime while af - rvb state is favored in larger @xmath15 and @xmath0 , consistent with the hubbard model . for both wave functions , a first order metal - insulator transition",
    "may be found @xcite .",
    "finally , we can plot a phase diagram in @xmath15-@xmath0 plane .",
    "the regime @xmath16 with @xmath17 should describe the physics of the crossover regime in the hubbard model .",
    "we see that if neglecting the high order term , this crossover corresponds to a metal - insulator phase transition .",
    "this paper was organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , the detailed deduction of the effective model is provided by canonical transformations . in sec .",
    "iii , the vmc results for the original hubbard model and the effective model are presented . in sec .",
    "iv , we give some discussions and conclusions . the mean field theory is arranged in the appendix for giving some feeling to relate our effective model to laughlin s gossamer superconducting model .",
    "we start from the hubbard model on a two - dimensional square lattice where the hopping energy may be dependent on the occupation of sites involved @xcite . including the on - site coulomb interaction , this hubbard model reads @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the number of the site ; @xmath20 , @xmath21 with @xmath22 a spin-@xmath23 electron annihilation operator at site @xmath24 and the kinetic term is given by @xmath25 here @xmath26 creates ( destroys ) a double - occupied site .",

    "we shall prove that the result effective hamiltonian in which all terms keep @xmath11-invariance is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a pair hopping kinetic energy and @xmath45 is the spin exchange as well as various nearest neighbor interactions , namely , @xmath46 for @xmath17 , @xmath47 .",
    "the canonical transformation for the hubbard model to the t - j model has been a standard technique @xcite .",
