    "this subcritical scenario involves the coexistence of laminar and turbulent phases for a range of reynolds numbers lying between @xmath1 below which any perturbation to the base flow asymptotically decays and @xmath2 above which the flow is found to be homogeneously turbulent .",

    "so far , no clear explanation for the emergence of such patterns has been given . a way to understand the subcritical transition and",
    "the emergence of patterns is to focus on the growth of an initial turbulent germ in formerly laminar flow .",
