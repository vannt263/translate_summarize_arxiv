    "the geometric phases are usually analyzed in the framework of first quantization by using the adiabatic approximation  @xcite-@xcite , though a non - adiabatic treatment has been considered in , for example , @xcite and the ( non - adiabatic ) correction to the geometric phases has been analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian , which contains a set of slowly varying external parameters , has no obvious singularity by itself . but",
    "a singularity reminiscent of the magnetic monopole is induced at the level crossing point , which is controlled by the movement of the external parameters , and the associated geometric phases appear in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "a remarkable fact is that the geometric phase factors thus introduced are rather universal independently of detailed physical processes .",
    "the topological properties are considered to be responsible for this universal behavior .",
    "also , interesting mathematical ideas such as parallel transport and holonomy are often used  @xcite in the framework of adiabatic approximation .",
    "the geometric phases revealed the importance of hitherto un - recognized phase factors in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "it may then be interesting to investigate how those phases appear in the exact formulation .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to formulate the level crossing problem by using the second quantization technique , which works both in the path integral and operator formulations .",
    "we thus derive a convenient exact formula for geometric terms , including the off - diagonal terms as well as the conventional diagonal terms . in this formulation",
    ", the analysis of geometric phases is reduced to the familiar diagonalization of the hamiltonian .",
    "namely , all the information concerning the extra phase factors is contained in the effective hamiltonian . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this fact that the geometric phases are interpreted as parts of the hamiltonian has been noted though only the diagonal geometric terms have been analyzed in the adiabatic picture .",
    "our formulation is more general without assuming the adiabatic picture .",
    "when one diagonalizes the hamiltonian in a very specific limit , one recovers the conventional geometric phases defined in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "one can thus analyze the geometric phases in the present formulation without using the mathematical notions such as parallel transport and holonomy .",
    "instead , a hidden local gauge symmetry plays an important role in our formulation .",
    "if one diagonalizes the hamiltonian in the other extreme limit , namely , in the infinitesimal neighborhood of level crossing for any fixed finite time interval @xmath0 , one can show that the geometric phases become trivial and thus no monopole - like singularity . at the level crossing point ,",
    "the conventional energy eigenvalues become degenerate but the degeneracy is lifted if one diagonalizes the geometric terms . since the time interval involved in the practical physical processes is always finite , our analysis implies an important change in our understanding of the qualitative aspects of geometric phases .",
    "for example , our analysis implies that the topological interpretation  @xcite of geometric phases such as the topological proof of the longuet - higgins phase - change rule  @xcite fails in the practical born - oppenheimer approximation where a large but finite ratio of two time scales is involved and @xmath0 is identified with the period of the slower system .    in our analysis , it is important to distinguish the precise adiabatic approximation , where the time interval @xmath0 measured in units of the shorter time scale is taken to be @xmath1  @xcite , from the practical born - oppenheimer approximation where a large but finite ratio of two time scales is involved and the variables with the slower time scale are approximately treated as external c - number parameters .",
    "our analysis shows that the integrability of the schrdinger equation for a regular hamiltonian and the appearance of the seemingly `` non - integrable phases '' are consistent : to be precise , the integrability of the schrdinger equation becomes relevant when the slowly varying external parameters are promoted to the dynamical variables of a more fundamental regular hamiltonian .",
    "we also clarify the difference between the geometric phases associated with level crossing and the exact topological object such as the aharonov - bohm phase . a crucial difference between the quantum anomaly and the geometric phases associated with level crossing is also noted .",
    "the basic idea involved in the present formulation has been reported elsewhere  @xcite , and we here present further details of the analyses .",
    "we start with the generic ( hermitian ) hamiltonian @xmath2 for a single particle theory in a slowly varying background variable @xmath3 .",

    "as we already mentioned , the fact that the berry s phase can be understood as a part of the hamiltonian , i.e.,_dynamical _ , has been noted in an adiabatic picture  @xcite .",
    "our formula does not assume the adiabatic approximation , and thus it gives a generalization .    in the operator formulation of the second quantized theory , we thus obtain the effective hamiltonian ( depending on bose or fermi statistics ) @xmath24 with @xmath25_{\\mp}=\\delta_{n , m}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that these formulas ( 2.6 ) , ( 2.12 ) and ( 2.14 ) are exact and , to our knowledge , the formulas ( 2.12 ) and ( 2.14 ) have not been analyzed before   in terms of the instantaneous eigenfunctions in ( 2.10 ) ; one then deals with simultaneous equations for the variables @xmath26 .",

    "we would like to comment on the possible advantages of using the second quantization technique .",
    "as we have already mentioned , all the results of the second quantization are in principle reproduced by the first quantization in the present single - particle problem . this fact is exemplified by the relation ( 2.27 ) .",

    "first of all , the general geometric terms are explicitly and neatly formulated by the second quantization both for the path integral ( 2.12 ) and the operator formalism ( 2.27 ) .",
    "also , our emphasis is on the diagonalization of the hamiltonian rather than on the subtle notion of phases .",
    "this emphasis on the hamiltonian is also manifest in the second quantization on the left - hand side of ( 2.27 ) .",
    "another technical advantage in the present formulation is related to the phase freedom of the basis set in ( 2.10 ) .",

    "one can confirm that both of the path integral measure and the action in ( 2.12 ) are invariant under this gauge transformation . by using this gauge freedom",
    ", one can choose the phase convention of the basis set @xmath46 such that the analysis of geometric phases becomes most transparent ; in ( 3.4 ) later , we choose the basis set @xmath50 such that the artificial singularity introduced by the use of polar coordinates becomes minimum .",

    "the hamiltonian ( 2.1 ) , which is parametrized by a set of external parameters , gives rise to a unique time development for a given @xmath19 even in the presence of non - integrable phase factors .",
    "if one understands that the hamiltonians with different @xmath19 define completely different theories , one need not compare theories with different @xmath19 and thus the issue of the integrability of the schrdinger equation does not directly arise .",
    "however , in the practical applications of geometric phases , one usually uses the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "the external parameters @xmath19 then become dynamical variables of a more fundamental hamiltonian , and the appearance of non - integrable phases suggests that one can not deform some of the paths @xmath19 smoothly to other sets of paths @xmath19 .",
    "the integrability of the schrdinger equation defined by the _ regular _",
    "fundamental hamiltonian could then be spoiled , since the different paths @xmath19 are supposed to be able to be deformed smoothly to each other for the regular hamiltonian in the schrdinger equation .",
    "our analysis however shows that geometric phases are topologically trivial for any finite time interval @xmath0 and thus the integrability of the basic schrdinger equation is always ensured .    from the view point of path",
    "integral , the formula ( 2.6 ) where the hamiltonian is diagonalized both at @xmath15 and @xmath16 if @xmath17 shows no obvious singular behavior at the level crossing point . on the other hand , the path integral ( 2.12 ) becomes somewhat subtle at the level crossing point ; the bases @xmath46 are singular on top of level crossing as in ( 3.4 ) , and thus the unitary transformation @xmath179 to ( 2.9 ) and the induced geometric terms become singular there .",
    "the present analysis however shows that the path integral is not singular for any finite @xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that one can promote the variables @xmath19 to fully dynamical variables by adding the kinetic and potential terms for @xmath19 , and the path integral is still well - defined .",
    "we consider that this result is satisfactory since the starting hamiltonian ( 2.1 ) does not contain any obvious singularity even when one promotes the variables @xmath19 to fully dynamical variables .",
    "it is important to clarify the similarity and difference between the geometric phases associated with level crossing and the aharonov - bohm phase  @xcite .",
    "we thus start with the hermitian hamiltonian @xmath180 for a single particle theory in the _ time independent _ background gauge potential @xmath181 @xmath182 and thus no electric field .",
    "the uniform constant magnetic field @xmath183 is confined in a cylinder along the @xmath184-axis with a radius @xmath185 . the first quantized formulation of the aharonov - bohm effect is given by @xmath186 \\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int { \\cal d}\\vec{p}{\\cal d}\\vec{x } \\exp\\{\\frac{i}{\\hbar } \\int_{0}^{t } dt[(\\vec{p}+e\\vec{a}(\\vec{x}))\\cdot\\dot{\\vec{x } } -\\frac{1}{2m}\\vec{p}\\,{}^{2 } ] \\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int { \\cal d}\\vec{p}{\\cal d}\\vec{x } \\exp\\{\\frac{i}{\\hbar } \\int_{0}^{t } dt [ \\vec{p}\\cdot\\dot{\\vec{x}}-\\frac{1}{2m}\\vec{p}\\,{}^{2 } ] + \\frac{ie}{\\hbar } \\int_{c}\\vec{a}(\\vec{x})\\cdot d\\vec{x } \\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sum_n \\int [ { \\cal d}\\vec{p}{\\cal d}\\vec{x}]_{(n ) }   \\exp\\{\\frac{i}{\\hbar } \\int_{0}^{t } dt [ \\vec{p}\\cdot\\dot{\\vec{x}}-\\frac{1}{2m}\\vec{p}\\,{}^{2 } ] + \\frac{ie}{\\hbar } n\\phi \\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sum_n \\langle \\vec{x}(t)|\\exp\\{-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\int_{0}^{t } \\hat{h}_{0}dt\\}|\\vec{x}(0)\\rangle_{(n ) } \\exp\\{\\frac{ie}{\\hbar}n\\phi \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for any closed spatial path @xmath187 , @xmath188 , which winds the cylinder by @xmath75 times , and @xmath189 stands for the magnetic flux inside the cylinder .",
    "we used the translational invariance of the path integral measure @xmath190 for the transformation from the second line to the third line in ( 5.3 ) . note that the formula ( 5.3 ) is exact , and the phase factor gives a truly topological quantity even for any fixed finite @xmath0 ; for the general case with only @xmath191 specified , one needs to sum over @xmath75 in ( 5.3 ) . in practice ,",
    "the aharonov - bohm phase is analyzed in connection with interference effects , but the basic mathematical treatment is the same as in ( 5.3 ) .",
    "the path integral for the aharonov - bohm effect for the time interval @xmath4 in the second quantized formulation is given by @xmath192 \\ } \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we then define a complete set of eigenfunctions ( in a domain of 3-dimensional space with a cylinder along the @xmath184-axis of radius @xmath185 removed ) @xmath193 with a suitable boundary condition on the surface of the cylinder and expand @xmath194 then @xmath195 and the path integral is written as @xmath196 \\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we next define @xmath197 and then @xmath198 namely @xmath199 where @xmath200 is defined in terms of cylindrical coordinates ( with the inside of the cylinder removed ) , and its phase convention is defined to be single valued in the sense that @xmath201 if @xmath202 . in practical applications , one may choose @xmath200 such that it approaches a plane wave specified by the momentum @xmath203 at far away from the cylinder .    since the hamiltonian in ( 5.9 )",
    "is eliminated by a `` gauge transformation '' @xmath204 we have the probability amplitude in the first quantization @xmath205 for a closed path @xmath206 , we pick up the familiar phase factor as in ( 5.3 ) .    formulated in the manner ( 5.15 ) ,",
    "the aharonov - bohm phase is analogous to the geometric phase ( 3.11 ) associated with level crossing , but there are several critical differences .",
    "first of all , the aharonov - bohm effect is defined for a space which is not simply connected , and the aharonov - bohm phase is exact for any finite time interval @xmath0 ( one may consider a narrow cylinder @xmath207 with the magnetic flux @xmath208 kept fixed ) , whereas the geometric phase is topologically trivial for any finite time interval @xmath0 as we have shown .",
    "the summation over the winding number @xmath75 in ( 5.3 ) is generally required in the case of the aharonov - bohm phase , but no such summation in the case of the geometric phase since the notion of the winding number is not well - defined for any fixed finite @xmath0 .",
    "secondly , a closed path in the parameter space , which may have no direct connection with the real spatial coordinates , is important in the geometric phase , whereas a closed path in the real 3-dimensional space is important for the aharonov - bohm phase .",
    "related to this last property , the aharonov - bohm phase is defined for the time _",
    "independent _ gauge potential , whereas the geometric phase is defined for the explicitly time _",
    "dependent _ external parameter @xmath19 .",
    "the notion of berry s phase is known to be useful in various physical contexts  @xcite-@xcite , and the topological considerations are often crucial to obtain a qualitative understanding of what is going on .",
    "our analysis however shows that the topological interpretation of berry s phase associated with level crossing generally fails in practical physical settings with any finite @xmath0 .",
    "the notion of `` approximate topology '' has no rigorous meaning , and it is important to keep this approximate topological property of geometric phases associated with level crossing in mind when one applies the notion of geometric phases to concrete physical processes .",
    "this approximate topological property is in sharp contrast to the aharonov - bohm phase  @xcite which is induced by the time - independent gauge potential and topologically exact for any finite time interval @xmath0 .",
    "the similarity and difference between the geometric phase and the aharonov - bohm phase have been recognized in the early literature  @xcite , but our second quantized formulation , in which the analysis of the geometric phase is reduced to a diagonalization of the effective hamiltonian , allowed us to analyze the topological properties precisely in the infinitesimal neighborhood of level crossing .",
    "the correction to the geometric phase in terms of the small slowness parameter @xmath209 has been analyzed , and the closer to a degeneracy a system passes the slower is the necessary passage for adiabaticity has been noted in  @xcite .",
    "but , to our knowledge , the fact that the geometric phase becomes topologically trivial for practical physical settings with any fixed finite @xmath0 , such as in the practical born - oppenheimer approximation where @xmath0 is identified with the period of the slower system , has been clearly stated only in the recent paper  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that this fact is proved independently of the adiabatic approximation .",
    "the notion of the geometric phase is very useful , but great care needs to be exercised as to its topological properties   showed , quite generally , that the non - integrable phases imply the existence of degeneracies , by means of the following topological argument .",
    "\" this enthusiasm about topology needs to be taken with due care . ] .",
    "our analysis shows that there are no mysteries about the phase factors of the schrdinger amplitude .",
    "all the information about the geometric phases is contained in the evolution operator ( 2.27 ) and thus in the path integral .",
    "the geometric phases are induced by the time - dependent ( gauge ) transformation ( 2.8 ) .",
    "one can analyze the geometric phases without referring to the mathematical notions such as parallel transport and holonomy which are useful in the framework of a precise adiabatic picture .",
    "instead , the consideration of invariance under the gauge symmetry ( 2.29 ) plays an important role in our formulation .",
    "also , the present path integral formulation shows a critical difference between the geometric phase associated with level crossing and the quantum anomaly ; the quantum anomaly is associated with the symmetry breaking by the path integral measure  @xcite , whereas the geometric phase arises from the non - anomalous terms associated with a change of variables as in ( 2.12 ) .",
    "the similarity between the quantum anomaly and the geometric phase is nicely elaborated in  @xcite .",
    "but the quantum anomaly is basically a local object in the 4-dimensional space - time whereas the geometric phase crucially depends on the infinite time interval as our analysis shows . besides , the basic symmetry involved and its breaking mechanism in the case of geometric phase are not obvious .",
    "a detailed analysis of this issue will be given elsewhere .",
    "+ we thank professor l. stodolsky for asking if our conclusion is modified when the phase choice of the basis set is changed , which prompted us to include an analysis of the hidden local gauge symmetry into the present paper .",
