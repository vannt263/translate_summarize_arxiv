    "decay can also occur through the exchange of other particles , perhaps some predicted by supersymmetric models , between the nucleons .",

    "we will treat these topics , particularly the first , more briefly .",
    "a recent review by elliott and vogel ( 2002 ) examined the impact of recent discoveries in neutrino physics on  decay , but since then several experiments ( e.g.  kamland and wmap ) have reported results and a number of papers interpreting the results have appeared , with the consequence that neutrino masses and mixings are better understood .",
    "we will focus most intently on the _ additional _ neutrino physics that can be extracted from decay in light of these very recent results .",

    "the recent progress of the nemo-3 program ( sarazin 2000 ) has culminated in excellent  results . in particular , the energy spectra from @xmath136mo contain nearly 10@xmath149 events and are nearly background free .",
    "these data permit , for the first time , a precise study of the spectra .",
    "in fact , there is hope that the data ( sutton 2004 ) will demonstrate whether the  transition is primarily through a single intermediate state or through a number of states ( imkovic 2001 ) .",
    "the detector consists of several thin foils placed between geiger - drift cells , surrounded by a scintillator calorimeter .",
    "nemo-3 began operation in february 2003 with several isotopes , @xmath136mo being the most massive at 7 kg , and plans to operate for 5 years .",
    "the collaboration plans to increase the mass of @xmath135se from 1 kg to 20 kg and begin an additional 5-year run .",
    "presently , a rn - removal trap is being installed to reduce the background , and operation should begin again by the summer of 2004 .",
    "the anticipated sensitivities for  are @xmath150y and @xmath151 yr for mo and se respectively . for the se data ,",
    "this corresponds to below 100 - 200 mev .",
    "a much bigger project is currently being planned that would use 100 kg of source .",
    "the apparatus would have a large footprint however and the frejus tunnel where nemo-3 is housed would not be large enough to contain it .",
    "currently the collaboration is studying the design of such a detector .      the xmass collaboration ( suzuki 2004 ; moriyama 2001 ) plans to build a 10 t natural xe liquid scintillation detector .",
    "they expect an energy resolution of 3% at 1 mev and hope to reach a value for  @xmath152 y. this detector would also be used for solar - neutrino studies and a search for dark matter .      in august of 2002",
    ", operations at the borexino experiment resulted in the spill of scintillator .",
    "this led to the temporary closure of hall c in the gran sasso laboratory and a significant change in operations at the underground laboratory . as a result ,",
    "efforts to convert the counting test facility ( ctf ) or borexino itself into a  experiment ( bellini 2001 ; caccianiga and giammarchi 2001 ) have been suspended ( giammarchi 2004 ) .",
    "searches for  to excited states in the daughter atom have been performed in a number of isotopes but only observed in @xmath136mo .",
    "( the experimental situation is reviewed by barabash 2000 ) .",
    "these experiments typically search for the @xmath144 rays that characterize the excited states and therefore are not mode - specific searches .",
    "the interpretation therefore is that the measured rate ( or limit ) is for the  mode .",
    "these data may be very useful to qrpa nuclear theory because the behavior of the nuclear matrix elements with respect to @xmath153 for the excited state decays is different than for transitions to the ground state ( griffiths and vogel 1992 , aunola and suhonen 1996 , suhonen 1998 ) .",
    "thus , the excited state transitions probe different aspects of the theory and may provide insight into the physics of the matrix elements .    a further reason for interest in decays to the excited state , as mentioned earlier ,",
    "is the potential ability to discover the process mediating the decay ( imkovic and faessler 2002 , tomoda 2000 ) .",
    "however , the decay rate to an excited state is 10 - 100 times smaller than rate to the ground state ( suhonen 2000a , 2000b ) .",
    "furthermore the structure of the excited state in the daughter nucleus is not as well understood as the ground state , and this increases the relative uncertainty in the nuclear matrix element .",
    "the @xmath154 modes of decay have not received the attention of the @xmath155 modes because of the greatly reduced phase space and corresponding long half - lives . however , their detection would provide additional matrix - element data . furthermore ,",
    "if the zero - neutrino mode were detected , it might provide a handle on whether the decay is predominantly mediated by a light neutrino or by right - handed currents ( hirsch 1994 ) .",
    "radiative neutrinoless double electron capture is a possible alternative to traditional neutrinoless double beta decay ( sujkowski and wycech 2003 ) . in this process",
    ", two electrons are captured from the atomic electron cloud and a radiated photon carries the full q - value for the decay .",
    "a resonance condition can enhance the rate when the energy release is close to the 2p-1s energy difference . in this case ,",
    "high - z , low - energy - release isotopes are favored ( e.g. @xmath156sn ) .",
    "unfortunately the mass differences for the candidate isotopes are not known precisely enough to accurately predict the overlap between the two energies .",
    "if a favorable overlap does exist , however , the sensitivity to  might rival that of decay .      the kdhk spectrum shows a feature very close to the  endpoint . this intriguing result will need to be confirmed or refuted experimentally .",
    "one can see the required operation parameters for a confirmation experiment from klapdor - kleingrothaus ( 2004 ) .",
    "one needs about 75 kg - y of exposure , and a background lower than about 0.5 counts/(kg y ) .",
    "note that most of the proposals described above will all accomplish this very early on in their program if they meet their design goals .",
    "if instead one designs an experiment only to test the claim ( not to provide a precise measurement of the ) then a 100-kg experiment could provide the answer after a modest run time .",
    "if the kdhk result holds up , it will be a very exciting time for neutrino - mass research .",
    "a  near 400 mev means that @xmath141-decay experiments and cosmology will be sensitive to the mass .",
    "as a result , one can certainly imagine a not - too - distant future in which we know the neutrino mass and its majorana - dirac character . towards this goal , a precision measurement of  will be required . to accomplish this",
    ", we will need more than one  experiment , each with a half - life measurement accurate to 10 - 20% . at this level",
    "the uncertainty will be dominated by the matrix element uncertainty even if future calculations can be trusted to 50% . with two experiments utilizing different isotopes",
    ", one might disentangle the uncertainty in .",
    "the next generation of experiments hopes to be sensitive to @xmath157 . if they fail to see  at that level , the target for the succeeding generation of efforts will be @xmath158 .",
    "this scale is an order of magnitude lower and hence will require two orders of magnitude more isotopic mass , approximately 100 tons of isotope .    a 100-ton experiment will have to face the same technical challenges associated with radioactive backgrounds and energy resolution as today s proposals .",
    "( see elliott and vogel 2002 for a discussion of these issues . ) in addition , a background from solar neutrinos will also have to be considered .",
    "solar neutrinos can result in a background via elastic scattering or charged current interactions .",
    "the rate ( @xmath159 ) of  events can be written    @xmath160    where @xmath161 is the molecular weight of the  isotope and @xmath59 is the mass of the target in tons .",
    "for pure @xmath162xe , this would result in about 3  events per year per ton for  = 10@xmath163 y.    elastic scattering ( es ) rates from @xmath164b solar neutrinos can be comparable to this  rate if the target material contains the isotope at a low fraction .",
    "for example , a 2% solution of xe in liquid scintillator has been discussed as a possible  experiment .",
    "of course the number of es events within the  window depends on the resolution and therefore we need the cross section per unit energy ( @xmath165)(bahcall 1989 ) @xmath166 the rate of es events ( @xmath167 ) is then given by @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the @xmath164b neutrino flux ( @xmath170 /(cm@xmath73 s ) ) , @xmath171 is avagadro s number , @xmath44 is the  energy window in kev , @xmath172 is the target molecular weight , and @xmath173 is the number of electrons per molecule of the target . for a pure xe target with an energy window of 50 kev , we find @xmath174 .",
    "this background is not a problem for any pure xe detector that proposes a half - life sensitivity of @xmath175 y. it is significant for a detector with only 2% xe at = @xmath176 y.    charge - current ( @xmath177 ) scattering of solar neutrinos , especially the large flux of solar pp neutrinos may also be a background for  decay . as pointed out by raghavan ( 1997 ) ,",
    "some  isotopes make interesting targets for pp solar neutrino experiments because the reaction produces a radioactive isotope , the intermediate nucleus in the  process .",
    "the decay of this product nucleus provides a coincidence signature for the @xmath177 reaction .",
    "however for several reasons , this process must be considered as a background for  decay .",
    "first , the @xmath141-decay q - value of the intermediate nucleus is larger than the  q - value for most of the nuclei .",
    "furthermore , the half - life of the intermediate nucleus is often too long for an effective coincidence identification . finally , the end product @xmath141-decay daughter nucleus is the same as the  daughter .",
    "the rate of @xmath177 events ( @xmath178 ) can be written :    @xmath179    where @xmath180 is the solar neutrino flux , @xmath181 is the spectrum - weighted @xmath177 cross section , @xmath182 is the fraction of intermediate nucleus @xmath141 decays that fall within the  energy window , and @xmath183 is the rate of @xmath177 interactions in snu ( @xmath184 interactions/(s target atom ) ) . for example , the total @xmath185 ( that is with @xmath186 ) in the moon proposal is much higher than @xmath187 for a half - life of @xmath176 y. in that case however , the intermediate nucleus has a convenient lifetime of 16 s , short enough that a delayed coincidence can identify the decay and separate it event - by - event from  candidate events .",
    "@xmath178 in each  isotope must be considered separately .",
    "for example , @xmath146ge , @xmath129cd , and @xmath128te do not have a low - lying intermediate nucleus level reachable by the high - flux pp neutrinos , and in the case of ge , @xmath188be neutrinos .",
    "alternatively , @xmath135se , @xmath189yb , and @xmath190gd have significant cross sections but the long - lived intermediate nucleus prevents easy anti - coincidence identification .",
    "in the important case of @xmath162xe , little is known about the structure of the intermediate - nucleus ( @xmath162cs ) excited states .",
    "the decay of @xmath162cs is to highly excited levels in @xmath162ba that decay themselves via @xmath144 emission .",
    "this results in a relatively large @xmath182 , but also a @xmath144-ray cascade that might provide a signature to eliminate the potential background .",
    "@xmath137nd is another isotope in which little is known about the intermediate - nucleus excited states .",
    "if the reader retains anything from this review , it should be that the information recently acquired from oscillation experiments makes this an exciting time for  decay because the next generation of experiments will be sensitive to neutrino masses on the order of @xmath191 if a nonzero rate is seen , we will know that neutrinos are majorana particles . with some progress on the calculation of nuclear matrix elements",
    " and we believe progress is possible  a nonzero rate in these experiments should allow the determination of the hierarchy realized by nature and the absolute mass scale .",
    "if no signal is seen , we should be able to say either that the hierarchy is normal or that neutrinos are dirac particles .",
    "although none of the next - generation experiments is ready to operate , many of the new proposals are promising .",
    "we are hopeful that with concentrated effort from theorists and experimentalists ,  decay will add to our growing understanding of neutrinos .",
    "many people helped us in preparing this manuscript .",
    "in particular , frank avignone and petr vogel read it critically .    a number of our experimental colleagues assisted by ensuring that our descriptions of their work were accurate .",
