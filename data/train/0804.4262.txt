    "<S> we derive energy - norm a posteriorierror bounds for an euler time - stepping method combined with various spatial discontinuous galerkin schemes for linear parabolic problems . for accessibility , we address first the spatially semidiscrete case , and then move to the fully discrete scheme by introducing the implicit euler time - stepping . </S>",

    "<S> , we apply it to the interior penalty discontinuous galerkin method , which requires the derivation of novel a posteriorierror bounds . for the analysis of the time - dependent problems we use the elliptic reconstruction technique and we deal with the nonconforming part of the error by deriving appropriate computable a posterioribounds for it . </S>"
