    "the bad convergence of the perturbation series is not surprising . ] in the lower portion of table  [ tab:1 ] , we show the results for the wilson coefficients obtained by taking the principal value of the borel integral .",
    "the quoted errors reflect the renormalon ambiguities , which are sizeable , in particular , at the scale @xmath156 .",
    "the borel resummation gives values close to those obtained when the series is truncated at the minimal term ( in the latter case the error is taken to be the size of the minimal term ) , as it is expected on general grounds . in the last row",
    "we show the short - distance contributions to the coefficient functions arising from virtualities above @xmath166gev ( in the v scheme ) , as defined in ( [ csd ] ) .",
    "the portion of infrared contributions is much larger at the scale @xmath156 than it is at the scale @xmath153 .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot ] , where the arrows indicate the location of the separation scale @xmath167gev ( corresponding to 435 mev in the @xmath13  scheme ) .",
    "if the infrared contributions are cut away , the resulting values of the coefficients are again close to their values obtained from low - order calculations",
    ".    although the all - order results are instructive , we must not forget that they are obtained in a very questionable approximation scheme ( the large-@xmath33 limit ) .",
    "indeed , the few exact results available indicate that the perturbation series may be much better behaved than indicated by the large-@xmath33 limit . still , we trust in the qualitative observations that the series start to diverge at some ( low ) order , and that the onset of the divergence is reached early the lower the scale @xmath2 is",
    ". we will now explore the implications of these results for the phenomenology of the heavy - quark expansion . for a consistent inclusion of power - suppressed effects the perturbative coefficients of the leading terms",
    "must be known with sufficient accuracy .",
    "different truncation or resummation schemes imposed on the short - distance coefficients imply different definitions of the hadronic parameters appearing at higher order in the heavy - quark expansion , such as the parameter @xmath146 in ( [ splitratio ] ) . only when the perturbative coefficients are truncated close to their asymptotic value , the hadronic parameters are @xmath2 independent as they should . when applied to the particular case of the chromomagnetic operator ,",
    "the conclusion is that there is not much to be gained by calculating @xmath17 beyond the first few orders of perturbation theory .",
    "taking into account that the series for @xmath168 diverges earlier than that for @xmath169 , we may argue that the optimal perturbative prediction for the ratio based on exact information is obtained by combining the nnlo result at the bottom scale with the nlo result at the charm scale .",
    "this gives @xmath170 in the large-@xmath33 limit , the corresponding ratio equals 0.81 and is indeed very close to the principal value of the borel integral . using the result ( [ opt ] )",
    ", we conclude that the power corrections in ( [ splitratio ] ) give a contribution of about 11% , corresponding to a scale @xmath171mev .",
    "thus , if the asymptotic behaviour of perturbation theory is carefully taken into account , it appears that power corrections in the heavy - quark expansion are well under control ."
