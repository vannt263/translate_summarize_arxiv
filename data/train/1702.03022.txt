    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials have been attracting tremendous interest since the discovery of graphene in 2004.@xcite many new 2d materials have been realized to date.@xcite in this family of 2d materials , graphene still stands out in that it is completely flat with only one - atom - thickness .",
    "other monolayer materials such as silicene or phosphorene have buckled structures with atoms displaced perpendicular to the 2d plane ; while materials like transition metal dichalcogenides consist of multiple atomic layers . the single - atom - thickness endows graphene with superior properties.@xcite representing the ultimate limit of a material s thickness , it enables devices that are more compact in size ; and the atomic thickness also makes the material more susceptible to external control , e.g. , the carrier density in graphene can be tuned up to @xmath5/@xmath4 by gating.@xcite    meanwhile , it is much desired to realize various symmetry - breaking phases in 2d materials .",
    "2d materials with magnetic ordering are of particular interest , because such nanoscale magnetism is not only fascinating from a scientific point of view , it is also of great value for important applications such as magnetic information storage and spintronics devices.@xcite extensive efforts have been devoted in this direction , mostly by doping non - magnetic 2d materials with magnetic atoms or by creating certain structural defects.@xcite however , the induced magnetism is usually weak , and it is very difficult to control the distribution of dopants or defects in experiment . moreover , acting as extrinsically introduced scattering centers , these dopants or defects would strongly scatter the carriers and deteriorate the material s transport properties .    it would become much better if we could generate magnetism without introducing extrinsic dopants or defects , which could avoid the above - mentioned severe disadvantages .",
    "it was predicted that the 2d mon@xmath0 is an intrinsic magnetic material with its magnetic ordering tunable by strain.@xcite but monolayer mon@xmath0 has not been experimentally realized yet .",
    "another interesting proposal is to achieve tunable ferromagnetism in monolayer gase via gate controlled hole - doping.@xcite the resulting spin - polarization can be large , however , the magnetic transition ( curie ) temperature is still low ( @xmath6 k ) , not high enough for practical applications . it hence remains a challenge to find a dopant - free 2d material with room - temperature magnetism .",
    "in addition , these magnetic 2d crystals consist of multiple atomic layers , not being atomically thick . one may further ask : can we push the 2d magnetism down to one - atom - thickness ?    in this work , we address the above question by proposing room - temperature magnetism in holey 2d c@xmath0n ( @xmath12d - c@xmath0n ) monolayer crystal with single - atom - thickness via purely electron doping that can be readily achieved by gating .",
    "@xmath12d - c@xmath0n is a newly synthesized 2d material .",
    "experimentally , monolayer @xmath12d - c@xmath0n has been successfully isolated and transferred onto insulating substrate.@xcite it shows a direct bandgap @xmath71.96 ev measured by optical spectroscopy , and a field - effect - transistor fabricated based on it exhibits a high on / off ratio of @xmath8.@xcite without charge doping , @xmath12d - c@xmath0n is non - magnetic . here , using first - principles calculations , we show that ferromagnetic ordering can be easily induced in @xmath12d - c@xmath0n monolayer by electron doping , and remarkably , in a wide doping range ( @xmath9/@xmath4 to @xmath10/@xmath4 ) the material is in fact a half - metal with fully spin - polarized carriers for conduction .",
    "such doping levels can be readily achieved with currently available gating techniques , and gating provides a highly - efficient method to control magnetism in this material .",
    "the curie temperature is estimated up to 320 k. furthermore , we find that the magnetism can also be effectively tuned by lattice strain : starting from a half - metal state , a uniaxial strain @xmath11 can completely turn off the magnetism . to our best knowledge",
    ", this is the first time that room - temperature half - metallic ferromagnetism is ever proposed in a one - atom - thin 2d material via an intrinsic approach , without magnetic dopants or defects .",
    "these important advantages  the atomic thickness ,",
    "the high curie temperature , the easy control via gating or strain , and the experimental availability of the material  will make @xmath12d - c@xmath0n a highly promising platform to explore nanoscale magnetism and the many electronic and spintronic device applications .",
    "our first - principles calculations are based on the density functional theory ( dft ) using the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method@xcite as implemented in the vienna @xmath12-@xmath13 simulation package ( vasp).@xcite the generalized gradient approximation with the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) realization@xcite is used for the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "our main results are further checked by the hybrid functional ( hse06)@xcite approach .",
    "the kinetic energy cutoff is set to be 550 ev . the lattice constants and the ionic positions are fully optimized until the force on each ion is less than 0.01 ev /  .",
    "the convergence criteria for energy is chosen as 10@xmath14 ev . and",
    "a vacuum layer of 18   thickness is added to avoid artificial interactions between periodic images .",
    "the effect of charge - doping is simulated by changing the total number of electrons in the unit cell , with a compensating jellium background of opposite charge to maintain the neutrality . in calculating magnetic properties ,",
    "since magnetism has sensitive dependence on the states at fermi level @xmath15 , we use a refined @xmath16-mesh of size 27@xmath227@xmath21 to ensure the convergence of result .",
    "the lattice structure of monolayer @xmath12d - c@xmath0n is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] , which may be viewed as a honeycomb lattice of benzene rings connected through nitrogen atoms .",

    "it shows a semiconducting phase with a direct bandgap @xmath20 ev at the @xmath21 point , in good agreement with the previous dft results and the experimental value ( @xmath22 ev).@xcite the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) at the @xmath21 point involves three nearly degenerate states , and one band has almost flat dispersion along the @xmath21-m direction ( see figure  [ fig2](b ) ) .",
    "this leads to a prominent van hove singularity in the density of states ( dos ) at the cbm . in the right panel of figure  [ fig2](a )",
    ", we show the projected dos .",
    "one observes that the states contributing to the van hove singularity at cbm are mainly from the @xmath23 orbitals of c and n atoms , i.e. , from the @xmath24 electrons .",
    "nearly flat bands and van hove singularity also appear at the valence band maximum ( vbm ) in the pbe band structure , where the states are mainly consisting of @xmath25 and @xmath26 orbitals .",
    "we have repeated the calculation by using the hybrid functional ( hse06 ) ( see supporting information ) .",
    "the bandgap at hse06 level is larger ( @xmath272.45 ev ) , as one should expect .",
    "interestingly , around vbm , we find that the hse result has a different band ordering , making the van hove singularity pushed below the vbm .",
    "nevertheless , both pbe and hse functionals give almost the same band structure around cbm .",

    "however , due to the van hove singularity at cbm , we find that the system develops a spontaneous ferromagnetic ordering even with a slight electron doping . in figure  [ fig3](a )",
    ", we plot the magnetic moment and the spin polarization energy ( both are per doped electron carrier ) versus the doping density . here",
    "the spin polarization energy is defined as the energy difference between the non - spin - polarized phase and the spin - polarized phase .",
    "one observes that ferromagnetism already appears at a low doping with @xmath30/@xmath4 , and with increasing doping density , the magnetic moment per carrier has a sharp increase , reaching 0.96@xmath31/e at @xmath32/@xmath4 .",
    "the moment is close to 1@xmath31 per carrier in a wide range from @xmath33/@xmath4 to @xmath10/@xmath4 , indicating that the carriers become fully spin - polarized in this doping range . above the range ,",
    "the moment begins to decrease and has a quick drop above @xmath34/@xmath4 . in comparison , the spin polarization energy also increase first and then decrease as a function of @xmath29 , however , it does not show a plateau region like the magnetic moment .",

    "this value is quite large , almost three times of that in monolayer gase,@xcite suggesting that the ferromagnetic ordering here would be more stable .",
    "the spin polarization energy drops to zero above @xmath37/@xmath4 , indicating that the system returns to non - magnetic at higher doping .",

    "the fermi level is taken to be energy zero .",
    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in figure  [ fig3](b ) , we plot the spin polarization of the carriers @xmath38 , where @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) is the population of spin - up ( spin - down ) carriers .",
    "one clearly observes that the carriers are 100% spin - polarized in the doping range from @xmath33/@xmath4 to @xmath10/@xmath4 , where the system becomes half - metallic . as a representative ,",
    "we take @xmath41/@xmath4 in this range , and plot the corresponding band structure in figure  [ fig3](c ) and the spin - resolved dos in figure  [ fig3](d ) .",
    "compared with the undoped ( non - magnetic ) case , one observes that the shape of the band dispersion is more or less unchanged .",
    "the main difference is that the bands are now spin - split , and the fermi level cuts through only one spin species .",
    "the energy splitting between the two spin bands around cbm is about 0.1 ev , corresponding to an effective zeeman splitting from an external magnetic field of @xmath7860 t if one assumes a @xmath42 factor of 2 and ignores the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment .",
    "such half - metal state with 100% spin polarization allows fully spin - polarized transport , hence it is very much desired for spintronics applications .",
    "our result shows that half - metallic ferromagnetism can indeed be realized in a material with only one atom thickness without extrinsic dopant atoms or defects .",
    "the emergence of ferromagnetism here can be explained in the stoner picture,@xcite which has been adopted to explain the magnetism in several @xmath43-orbital systems , particularly in so - called `` @xmath44 ferromagnetic semiconductors''.@xcite in this model , ferromagnetism would appear spontaneously if the stoner criterion @xmath45 is satisfied . here",
    "@xmath46 is the strength of the magnetic exchange interaction , and @xmath47 is the dos at the fermi level of the non - spin - polarized band structure .",
    "when the stoner parameter @xmath48 is greater than 1 , the relative gain in exchange energy would dominate over the loss in kinetic energy , and hence the system would favor a ferromagnetic ground state . indeed , in our dft calculation , we find that the stoner parameter is larger than 1 in a wide range from low doping @xmath49/@xmath4 up to @xmath50/@xmath4 ( its value is about 4 in the half - metallic range ) .",
    "this analysis indicates that the huge dos associated with the van hove singularity plays a key role in the appearance of ferromagnetism .",
    "as we mentioned , the electron doping level can be conveniently tuned by the available gating technique .",
    "for example , the doping density on the order of @xmath5/@xmath4 has been demonstrated in graphene by ion liquid gating,@xcite and of @xmath51/@xmath4 in transition metal dichalcogenides by back - gate gating.@xcite owing to its atomic - thickness , we expect that doping range discussed in previous paragraphs can be readily achieved in @xmath12d - c@xmath0n monolayers . we have also estimated the magnetic transition ( curie ) temperature . at the mean field level , this can be done by evaluating the magnetic moment through minimizing the electronic free energy at a given temperature.@xcite we find that the estimated curie temperature can be up to 320 k at the doping density of @xmath10/@xmath4 , correlated with the large spin - polarization energy discussed in figure  [ fig3](a ) .",
    "thus , our calculation demonstrates that a room - temperature half - metallic ferromagnetism can be achieved in an existing atom - thin 2d material , and this magnetism can be readily turned on and off via gating .",

    "( b ) by applying a gate voltage , the c@xmath0n monolayer is driven to the half - metallic phase .",
    "hence a fully spin - polarized current can flow through.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    an experimental setup that can be used to probe the above predicted property is illustrated in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "it takes a standard field effect transistor configuration , with a @xmath12d - c@xmath0n monolayer as the channel material . without applied gate voltage ( figure  [ fig4](a ) )",
    ", the channel is a good semiconductor , and no current can pass through .",
    "hence the transistor is in the off state .",
    "when a gate voltage is applied ( figure  [ fig4](b ) ) , the @xmath12d - c@xmath0n monolayer becomes half - metallic .",
    "then current can flow through , and most importantly , the current is fully spin - polarized .",
    "the spin - polarization can be measured by using magnetic electrode or by subsequent spin filtering .",
    "in fact , the device proposed here can be well incorporated into spintronics circuits as a controlled spin generator .",

    "( b ) magnetic moment per carrier versus strain @xmath52 for several different doping densities . here",
    "the strain @xmath52 is applied along the armchair direction.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    besides gating , the magnetic property may also be tuned by lattice strain .",
    "2d materials typically can sustain large strains , e.g. , graphene , mos@xmath0 , and phosphorene can sustain strains above @xmath54.@xcite a previous computational study has shown that the critical strain of @xmath12d - c@xmath0n monolayer is larger than @xmath55.@xcite in figure  [ fig5](a ) , we plot the band structure of @xmath12d - c@xmath0n monolayer without doping under a uniaxial 8% strain along the armchair direction . compared with the unstrained band structure in figure  [ fig2](a )",
    ", one observes that the initially degenerate states at the cbm split due to the reduced symmetry , and a more dispersed band is pushed below the flat band , forming the new cbm . as a result , the original van hove singularity is higher in energy and the dos at the new cbm is much decreased .",
    "according to the stoner model , this would reduce the tendency towards ferromagnetism under electron doping . indeed , as shown in figure  [ fig5](b ) , starting from an initially half - metallic state , e.g. , with @xmath33/@xmath4 , by increasing uniaxial strain , the magnetic moment per carrier is decreased continuously , and is fully suppressed above 8% strain .",
    "similar trend is observed at other doping densities and also for strains along the zigzag direction ( see supporting information ) .",
    "experimentally , strain can be applied by stretching or bending a flexible substrate on which the 2d material is attached , or it can be controlled electrically by using a piezoelectric substrate.@xcite it provides a powerful alternative method to control the magnetism in @xmath12d - c@xmath0n monolayers .",
    "we discuss several points before concluding .",
    "first , in the above calculation , we take the spin - polarization direction to be perpendicular to the 2d plane . due to the very weak spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) strength of the light elements",
    "c and n , the material exhibits very weak magneto - crystalline anisotropy .",
    "we have performed the calculation including soc and found that the out - of - plane polarized state and the in - plane polarized state have negligible energy difference ( less than @xmath56 mev / e ) .",
    "this shows that the material is a soft ferromagnet , with a low magnetic coercivity .",
    "this could be an important advantage for its use as dynamic layers in nano - magnetic devices , which leads to low energy dissipation during magnetic reversal processes .",
    "second , a recent theoretical study proposed to realize magnetism in @xmath12d - c@xmath0n by adsorption of magnetic atoms.@xcite from the analysis here , we can see that not only the localized magnetic moments of the adsorbed magnetic atoms contribute to the magnetism , the possible charge doping could also contribute .",
    "in fact , the former factor is not a necessity for the induced magnetism in the current system .",
    "we have checked that even by adsorption of alkali atoms , due to the charge doping , the @xmath12d - c@xmath0n monolayer still becomes magnetic ( see supporting information ) . in addition , as we mentioned in the introduction part , introducing extrinsic dopant atoms has several severe drawbacks .",
    "the gate - controlled charge doping proposed here would be a more preferred approach .",
    "finally , when @xmath12d - c@xmath0n monolayers are stacked along the perpendicular direction , they form multilayer structures bonded by weak van der waals interactions.@xcite hence one expects that the doping induced magnetism may also appear for @xmath12d - c@xmath0n multilayers .",
    "it is also possible to combine @xmath12d - c@xmath0n with other 2d material into van der waals heterostructures,@xcite in which the interaction between magnetism and other possible orderings and carrier dynamics could lead to intriguing effects and device functionalities .",
    "in conclusion , by using first - principles calculations , we show that tunable ferromagnetism and half - metallicity can be generated in the recently synthesized c@xmath0n-@xmath12d monolayers via charge doping controlled by electric gating .",
    "the half - metallic state can be realized in a wide range of doping density from 4@xmath210@xmath3/@xmath4 to 8@xmath210@xmath3/@xmath4 , readily achievable by the existing gating technique .",
    "the curie temperature is estimated up to 320 k. in addition , the magnetism can be effectively tuned using lattice strain .",
    "this is the first time that room - temperature half - metallic magnetism is ever proposed in a 2d material with one - atom - thickness , which opens great opportunity to explore nanoscale magnetism and various electronic / spintronic device applications .",
