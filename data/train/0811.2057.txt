    "we define a _ shifted plactic class _ as the set of all words which have a given mixed insertion tableau . thus , shifted plactic classes are in bijection with shifted semistandard young tableaux .",
    "the following key property , analogous to that of lascoux and schtzenberger s in the ordinary case , holds ( theorem [ monoidtheorem ] ) : the shifted plactic class of the concatenation of two words @xmath5 and @xmath6 depends only on the shifted plactic classes of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
