    "the opal collaboration presented measurements of the fractional energy spectra of inclusive @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 @xcite production in @xmath11-boson decays based on their entire lep1 data sample .",
    "apart from the full cross sections , they also determined the contributions arising from @xmath12 decays .",
    "this enabled us , partly in collaboration with binnewies , to determine lowest - order ( lo ) and next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) sets of fragmentation functions ( ff s ) for these charmed ( @xmath13 ) hadrons @xcite .",
    "we took the charm - quark ff to be of the form proposed by peterson _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and thus obtained new values of the @xmath14 parameter , which are specific for our choice of factorization scheme .",
    "we worked in the qcd - improved parton model implemented in the pure modified minimal - subtraction ( @xmath5 ) renormalization and factorization scheme with @xmath15 massless quark flavors ( zero - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ) .",
    "this scheme is particularly appropriate if the characteristic energy scale of the considered production process , _ i.e. _ , the center - of - mass energy @xmath16 in the case of @xmath6 annihilation and the transverse momentum @xmath17 of the @xmath13 hadron in other scattering processes , is large compared to the bottom - quark mass @xmath18 .",
    "owing to the factorization theorem @xcite , the ff s defined in this scheme satisfy two desirable properties : ( i ) their scaling violations are ruled by the time - like dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) @xcite evolution equations ; and ( ii ) they are universal .",
    "thus , this formalism is predictive and suitable for global data analyses .",
    "we verified that the values of the branching and average momentum fractions of the various @xmath19 transitions evaluated at lo and nlo using our ff s @xcite are in reasonable agreement with the corresponding results from opal @xcite and other experiments  @xcite .",
    "we tested the scaling violations of our @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ff s @xcite by comparing the fractional energy spectra of these hadrons measured in non - resonant @xmath6 annihilation at @xmath20  gev @xcite , 29  gev @xcite , and 34.7 @xcite with our lo and nlo predictions to find reasonable agreement .",
    "since events of @xmath13-hadron production from @xmath21-hadron decay were excluded from the data samples at @xmath20  gev , we obtained a clean test of our charm - quark ff s .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the starting points @xmath22 for the dglap evolution in the factorization scale @xmath7 were taken to be @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "this choice is phenomenologically motivated by the observation that , in @xmath6 annhilation , which has been providing the most constraining input for the determinations of ff s , these values of @xmath22 represent the very production thresholds of the respective flavors .",
    "unfortunately , this choice is inconsistent with the convention underlying modern sets of parton density functions ( pdf s ) @xcite , which prefer to place the flavor thresholds at @xmath10 . for the reader",
    "s convenience , in this addendum to refs .",
    "@xcite , we thus repeat the analysis of that papers for the choice @xmath10 , so as to provide alternative lo and nlo sets of @xmath13 ff s that can be conveniently utilized together with those pdf s .",
    "the ff s presented below were already used as input for a nlo study @xcite of charmed - meson hadroproduction in @xmath23 collisions , which yielded agreement within errors with data collected by the cdf collaboration in run ii at the fermilab tevatron @xcite .",
    "we note in passing that , in the case of perturbatively induced ff s , which is quite different from the case of non - perturbative ff s ( involving substantial intrinsic components ) under consideration here , the choice @xmath10 is more natural , since , at nlo , it avoids finite matching conditions at the flavor thresholds @xcite .",
    "in the following , we concentrate on the most important results of refs .  @xcite that are affected by the shift in @xmath22 . these include the fit parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath14 defining the @xmath27 distributions of the @xmath28 ff s @xmath29 at @xmath30 , @xmath31 ^ 2 } , \\label{eq : cff}\\\\ d_b(x,\\mu_0 ^ 2)&=&nx^{\\alpha}(1-x)^{\\beta } , \\label{eq : bff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath32 values per degree of freedom ( @xmath33 ) achieved in the fits , and the branching fractions @xmath34 and average momentum fractions @xmath35 , @xmath36 where @xmath37 , at @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "in the present analysis , we adopt the up - to - date input information from our 2005 paper  @xcite .",
    "our new results are presented in tables  [ tab : par][tab : xav ] .",
    "comparing tables  [ tab : br ] and [ tab : xav ] with the corresponding tables in refs .",
    "@xcite , we observe that the branching and average momentum fractions are changed very little by the reduction in @xmath22 . for a comparison of these observables with experimental data ,",
    "we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    ".fit parameters of the charm- and bottom - quark ff s in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cff ] ) and ( [ eq : bff ] ) , respectively , for the various @xmath13 hadrons at lo and nlo .",
    "the corresponding starting scales are @xmath40  gev and @xmath41  gev , respectively .",
    "all other ff s are taken to be zero at @xmath42 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for lack of space , we refrain from presenting here any updated versions of figures included in refs .",
    "@xcite ; they would not exhibit any qualitatively new features . however , as already mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , the reduction in @xmath22 has an appreciable effect on the gluon ff s , which are only feebly constrained by @xmath6 data .",
    "this effect is visualized for @xmath43 in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] , where the @xmath10 to @xmath8 ratios of @xmath44 at @xmath45 , 10 , and 20  gev are shown as functions of @xmath27 .",
    "we observe that the reduction in @xmath22 leads to a significant enhancement of the gluon ff , especially at low values of @xmath27 .",
    "the results for @xmath46 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are very similar and , therefore , not shown here .",
    "in this addendum to refs .",
    "@xcite , we repeated the fits of non - perturbative @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ff s , both at lo and nlo in the @xmath5 factorization scheme , to opal data from lep1 @xcite for the reduced choice @xmath10 ( @xmath9 ) of starting point for the dglap evolution in the factorization scale @xmath7 .",
    "these ff s are appropriate for use in connection with modern sets of pdf s @xcite , which are implemented with the same convention for the heavy - flavor thresholds .",
    "a fortran routine that evaluates the values of these ff s as functions of the input variables @xmath27 and @xmath7 may be obtained by electronic mail upon request from the authors .",
    "this reduction in @xmath22 is inconsequential for the theoretical interpretation of experimental @xmath6 data because it is compensated by corresponding shifts in the fit parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath14 .",
    "however , the gluon ff s , which are only feebly constrained by @xmath6 data , play a significant role in hadroproduction .",
    "in fact , detailed analysis @xcite revealed that the increase in the gluon ff s due to the extension of the evolution length leads to a rise in cross section and thus improves the agreement with the cdf data of charmed - meson production in run  ii at the tevatron @xcite .",
