    "potential candidates for spintronic applications , the full - heusler compounds were intensively studied to understand their physical properties @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the interest in heusler compounds grew enormously due to the discovery of materials with high curie temperature , high spin polarization and low saturation of magnetization , which may be useful for new devices , related to the magnetic storage of information @xcite .",
    "another breakthrough was the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy , reported in thin films @xcite which may be incorporated in spin torque devices .",
    "finding novel materials with designed properties suitable for tunnelling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) devices @xcite , magnetic tunnel junctions @xcite or spin injection devices @xcite is another active field of ongoing research involving heusler compounds .",
    "the heusler family presents two possible variants of compounds : the half - heusler compounds , @xmath2 , 1:1:1 stoichiometry , with non - centrosymmetric cubic structure @xmath3 @xcite , and the full - heusler compounds @xmath4 , 2:1:1 stoichiometry , that crystallize either in the @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) structure with the cubic space group @xmath7 @xcite , or in the @xmath8 prototype , known as `` inverse heusler structure '' with @xmath9 space group @xcite .",
    "the inverse heusler structure is found in full - heusler compounds when the y element is more electronegative than x , all symmetries adopted are @xmath10 and no position with @xmath11 symmetry is present . in this case , the @xmath12 atoms are located in the non - equivalent 4a ( 0,0,0 ) and 4c ( 1/4,1/4,1/4 ) wychoff positions , while the y and z atoms occupy the 4b ( 1/2,1/2,1/2 ) and 4d ( 3/4,3/4,3/4 ) positions , respectively .",

    "we have used ab initio electronic - structure calculations to identify new half - metallic ferromagnetic materials , which are compatible with semiconductors , due to large enough spin - flip gaps .",
    "although many heusler compounds have been intensively investigated experimentally or theoretically and predicted to have half - metallic properties @xcite , @xmath13- based full - heusler compounds with z being an element from the fourth main group of the periodic table , have not been thoroughly studied to acquire an insight into the electronic structures and their magnetic properties .",
    "therefore , the density of states , bandstructures and magnetic properties were investigated for the @xmath14 ( z = si , ge , sn ) full - heusler compounds , based on density functional theory . the results of theoretical investigations of the @xmath13- based full - heusler compounds are analysed in the present work . to the best of our knowledge , this is actually the first time when @xmath15 and @xmath16 are reported up to now .",
    "the obtained theoretical results are compared with electronic structures and magnetic studies reported in literature for other heusler compounds .",
    "the half - metallic properties of @xmath14 ( z = si , ge , sn ) compounds have been subsequently examined via the self - consistent full potential linearized augmented plane wave ( fplapw ) method , implemented in wien2k code @xcite .",

    "the hybridization is dependent by the atomic arrangement of atoms and environment .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for all compounds studied , the major contributions to the total magnetic moments come from sc atoms , located in ( 4a ) wyckoff positions that have tetrahedral symmetries @xmath45 and are surrounded by co atoms , at @xmath46 distances ( @xmath38 are the optimised lattice parameters ) .",
    "this result is surprising because the sc atoms in standard state do not have magnetic properties .",
    "similar findings were reported in @xmath22-based half - metallic full heusler compounds , which also follow the `` 18-electron - rule '' , where the highest spin magnetic moment contributions come from ti atoms , @xcite .    despite the fact that sc atoms are coupled ferromagnetically ,",
    "their different neighbourhoods determine dissimilar magnetic moments .",
    "although the main group elements ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 or @xmath29 ) carry an insignificant magnetic moment , the z element surroundings influence the size of the band gap , from minority spin channel , by decreasing it , as the atomic radius of the main element becomes larger . furthermore , the atomic spin magnetic moments of sc atoms from both sites are decreasing , regardless of the main group elements . in the materials containing si or sn , the stress applied to structures , leading to unit cell expansions , determines the co magnetic moments to increase . in the case of @xmath15 compound ,",
    "the magnetic moment of co slightly increases , but does not exceed the magnetic moment of sc ( 4a ) , in spite of unit cell enlargement .",
    "however , the highest spin magnetic moments from @xmath47-based compounds are material specific . for example , in @xmath48 , ( y = cr , mn ; z = al , si ) compounds , the highest magnetic moments come from transition metal elements located in y position and coupled antiferromagnetically with sc atoms from both wyckoff positions @xcite .",
    "to summarise , in the present study , first principles ( fplapw ) calculations investigate the half - metallic features of @xmath23 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 full - heusler compounds , with @xmath8 -type structure , as potentially suitable materials for applications in spintronics .",
    "the electronic structure calculations and magnetic properties predict that @xmath23 compound is fully spin polarised half - metallic ferromagnet for lattice parameters ranging between 6.21 - 6.56 @xmath0 .",

    "the band structure of @xmath16 is completely spin polarized , with a semiconducting indirect band gap in minority spin channel at optimized lattice parameter , 6.62@xmath0 .",
