    "for over 30 years , very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) has been the prime observational method for studying compact extragalactic jets and it has been used extensively to investigate the morphology , kinematics , and polarization of the jets in parsec scales ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , studies of the jets continuum spectrum in the vlbi scale have been hitherto surprisingly rare , even though the synchrotron spectrum provides one of the very few available probes of the magnetic field and particle energy density in the jet @xcite . pioneering observations of the jet spectrum in parsec scales were done in the 1980s @xcite , but before the advent of the very long baseline array in 1993 , it was not usually possible to observe the source simultaneously at several frequencies , and the typical flux density variability of the compact jets made it difficult to combine observations from different epochs .",
    "vlba s frequency agility allows nowadays practically simultaneous multifrequency observations with a wide frequency coverage , and this has made the studies of the continuum spectrum of the parsec scale jets feasible ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , due to tricky image alignment and uneven @xmath0 plane coverage between different frequencies , extraction of the continuum spectra from a multifrequency vlbi data set is still a non - trivial task and requires a very careful planning , execution and analysis of the experiment .",
    "only a very small number of sources have been studied so far .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report the first results from the spectral analysis of multifrequency vlba observations of the quasar 3c273 ( @xmath1 ) . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly describe our new method for extracting spectra of individual emission features in the jet from a multifrequency vlbi data set . in section 3 ,",
    "the spectra observed on february 28 , 2003 are presented , and the measured synchrotron turnover frequencies and flux densities are used to estimate the physical conditions in the jet , i.e. the magnetic field and the relativistic electron energy density .",
    "the results are discussed in section 4 .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we use a cosmology with @xmath2 = 71 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath4 = 0.27 , and @xmath5 = 0.73 .",
    "this corresponds to a linear scale of 2.7 pc mas@xmath3 for 3c273 . for the spectral index @xmath6",
    ", we use the positive convention : @xmath7 .",
    "in the year 2003 , 3c273 was the target of a multiwavelength campaign organized to support the observations done with the integral @xmath8-ray satellite @xcite . to complement this campaign with imaging data",
    ", we carried out a polarimetric multifrequency monitoring of 3c273 using the vlba .",
    "these observations are described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , where a kinematical analysis of the component motions was presented .",
    "3c273 was observed with the vlba five times in 2003 for nine hours at each epoch .",
    "observations were made at six frequencies ( 5.0 , 8.4 , 15.3 , 22.2 , 43.2 and 86.2 ghz ) and individual scans at different frequencies were interleaved in order to obtain practically simultaneous multifrequency data set .",
    "the calibration , imaging and self - calibration of the data were done by the standard procedures .    in the data reduction ,",
    "special attention was paid to the amplitude calibration .",
    "the accuracy of the final flux density scale was checked by comparing the extrapolated zero baseline flux density of the compact calibrator source 3c279 at 5 , 8 , 22 and 43 ghz , to the interpolated flux densities from the vla polarization monitoring program @xcite , and at 86ghz to the quasi - simultaneous data from the sest telescope .",
    "the accuracy turned out to be as good as @xmath9 at the frequencies from 5 to 43ghz and @xmath10 at 86ghz .",
    "because the vlbi networks are not reconfigurable like , for example , the vla , their @xmath0 plane coverage differs significantly at different observing frequencies . typically , in the spectral analysis of the multifrequency vlbi data , the @xmath0 coverages at different frequencies have been matched either by simply throwing away the data at the large @xmath0 radii at high frequencies or by tapering the data to a common ( low ) resolution .",
    "this has the consequence that a significant amount of data are not used and much of the attainable angular resolution is lost . a broad frequency coverage , which is needed to reliably measure the turnover of the synchrotron spectrum , exacerbates the problem : for a frequency coverage of @xmath11ghz at the vlba , the common range of @xmath0 distances between the frequencies is only 4% of the whole range of observed @xmath0 radii .    by using a model - fitting based spectral extraction method ,",
    "the above - described problem with an uneven @xmath0 coverage can be significantly relieved .",
    "the idea is to use _ a priori _ knowledge of the source structure , measured at high frequencies , to allow at lower frequencies the derivation of sizes and flux densities of even those emission features that have mutual separations less than the rayleigh limit at the given frequency .",
    "this is possible because , if we have a template of the brightness distribution , the minimum resolvable size is a function of the signal - to - noise ratio of the visibility data , and for high snr data , it can be much smaller than the rayleigh limit ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in practice , this was done in the following way :    \\1 ) a simple source model , consisting of two - dimensional gaussian components , was formed at 43ghz .",
    "( in our case , since there were only 6 working antennas at 86ghz , the best angular resolution was obtained at 43ghz . )",
    "\\2 ) this template model was transferred to 22 and 86ghz .",
    "the relative positions of the components were fixed to the values obtained from model - fitting at 43ghz , and the models were aligned by assuming that optically thin components have frequency independent positions .",
    "\\3 ) model - fitting was run at each frequency letting only component sizes and flux densities in the transferred model to vary . if any two components had a separation smaller than @xmath12 of the beam size at the given frequency , these were replaced by single component in order not to try to extrapolate beyond @xmath0 radius corresponding to @xmath12 of the beam size , which is the typical uncertainty of a component position ( see paper i ) .",
    "if the residual map contained significant emission that was not accounted for by the transfered model , a new model component(s ) was added and model - fitting was run again .",
    "this produced a template model for the next lower frequency and steps 2 and 3 were repeated for all the frequencies .",
    "\\4 ) we assume that the angular size of a component varies smoothly over the frequencies .",
    "the sizes of the components were inspected as a function of frequency , and fitted with a power - law after removing clear outliers .",
    "the results indicated that sizes are nearly constant or decreasing slowly as a function of frequency ( the power - law indeces range from -0.3 to + 0.1 with typical uncertainties of @xmath13 ) .",
    "\\5 ) the angular sizes of the components were fixed to the values derived from the power - law fit ( typically a constant ) , and the model - fit was run again at all frequencies with the component flux densities as the only free parameters .",
    "this resulted in the final spectra for the components .",

    "this confirms the compound nature of 3c273 s flat radio spectrum : components become self - absorbed at progressively lower frequencies as they move out along the jet creating an apparently flat radio spectrum up to @xmath60ghz ( see fig .  8 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .     with @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively.,scaledwidth=58.0% ]    adopting the standard synchrotron theory and assuming that emission features are uniform and spherical , we have used the observed component spectra  together with the measured sizes and doppler factors  to estimate the magnetic field density , @xmath63 , the electron energy distribution normalization factor , @xmath64 , and the relativistic electron energy density , @xmath65 , of the components in table  1 .",
    "the formulae are given in @xcite .",
    "since we have _ measured _",
    "@xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath18 and @xmath55 , we can calculate @xmath63 and @xmath64 separately without having to assume equipartition conditions . the component size inserted in the formulae is 1.8 times the @xmath66 of the gaussian component @xcite .",
    "since @xmath18 was determined only for components c2 , b2 , b3 and b4 in paper  i , we have used an average value @xmath67 for the rest of the components .",
    "the very strong non - linear dependence of @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 on the observed quantities makes a linear approximation of the error propagation invalid , and we have employed a monte carlo approach to calculate the uncertainties .",
    "the results are listed in table  2 .",
    "fig .  3 shows @xmath63 as a function of @xmath58 , in a logarithmic scale .",
    "the core has magnetic field density of an order of 1gauss , which is compatible with the values derived from infrared and optical variability ( courvoisier et al . 1988 ) . generally , the magnetic field becomes weaker as we move out along the jet .",
    "however , there is a large discrepancy in @xmath63 between components b2 and b3 , both having about the same distance from the core .",
    "component b2 , which is located @xmath68mas north of b3 , has two orders of magnitude smaller @xmath63 than component b3 ( or b4 ) . the kinematic analysis presented in paper",
    "i already showed that there is a significant velocity gradient across the jet width at the same location : the northern component b2 has a bulk lorentz factor @xmath69 , while the southern components b3 and b4 have @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "the magnetic field and velocity gradients across the jet width are thus coincident : the slower northern component b2 has significantly smaller @xmath63 than the faster southern components b3 and b4 .",
    "are we seeing a spine / sheath structure in 3c273 ( with b3 and b4 corresponding to a fast spine and b2 to a slower layer ) , where the magnetic field density decreases from the high jet - axis value to the lower value in the sheath ?",
    "an argument against this interpretation is the absence of emission from the jet layer south of the spine .",
    "however , if the magnetic field in the layer has a large enough helical component , emission asymmetries can arise @xcite .",
