    "in this report , we analyse diffractive hadron leptoproduction at high energies and small @xmath0 . intensive experimental study of diffractive processes was performed in desy ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . the amplitude of vector meson production for longitudinally polarized photon and vector meson give a predominant contribution to the cross section as @xmath3 .",
    "it can be expressed in terms of generalized parton distribution ( gpd ) in the nucleon @xmath4 where @xmath0 is a fraction of the proton momentum carried by the outgoing gluon and @xmath5 is the difference between the gluon momenta ( skewedness ) @xcite .",
    "it was found within the gpd approach @xcite and two - gluon model @xcite that the leading - twist contribution to the cross section is far from experiment .",
    "the cross sections of diffractive quark- antiquark production at small @xmath0 @xcite were found to be expressed in terms of the same gluon distributions as for the vector meson production .",
    "such processes give a possibility to study properties of gpd at small @xmath0 .",
    "note that in polarized reactions spin - dependent parton distributions can be investigated .",
    "we discussed our results for vector meson production at small @xmath0 within gpd approach presented in @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the inclusion of transverse degrees of freedom leads to reasonable agreement of theory with experiment for light meson production .",
    "the double spin asymmetries for longitudinally polarized leptons and transversely polarized protons in diffractive @xmath1 production at high energies are investigated within the two - gluon exchange model .",
    "the predictions are made for a future erhic collider with polarized lepton and proton beams ( see e.g. @xcite ) where this asymmetry can be studied .",
    "let us study the diffractive hadron production in lepton - proton reactions @xmath6 at high energies . here",
    "the hadron state @xmath7 can contain either a vector meson or a @xmath1 system which are observed as two final jets .",
    "the reaction ( [ react ] ) can be described in terms of the kinematic variables which are defined as follows : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the initial and final lepton and proton momenta , respectively , @xmath11 is the photon virtuality , and @xmath12 is the momentum carried by the two - gluons ( pomeron ) .",
    "the variable @xmath13 appears in the @xmath1 production . in this case , the effective mass of a produced quark system @xmath14 might be large and @xmath15 can vary here from 0 to 1 . for the diffractive vector meson production , @xmath16 and @xmath17 for large @xmath11 . here",
    "the momentum @xmath18 is on the mass shell @xmath19 and @xmath20 determined by @xmath21 is small at high energies .",
    "the @xmath20 is not fixed for the @xmath22 production .    the light hadron production at small @xmath0",
    "is predominated by the gluon gpd .",
    "the gluon contribution to the helicity amplitudes for leptoproduction of longitudinally polarized vector mesons looks like @xmath23    the leading twist parton - level amplitudes have the form    ^(g)_0+,0 + = _ 0 ^ 1 d , [ sub - amp ] where @xmath24 is the distribution amplitude .    a model for the gluonic gpd is constructed by using a double distribution @xcite ^g_(x , t ) = _ 0 ^ 1dx_0 ^ 1-xdy f^g(x , y , t ) ( x - x - y ) , [ f]where the skewdness @xmath25 .",
    "the double distribution function is determined as f^g(x , y , t ) = 6 x g(x ) f(t ) .",
    "[ f1 ] here a factor @xmath26 models the @xmath27-dependence , @xmath28 is an ordinary gluon distribution which at small @xmath0 , is approximated by [ xgxq2 ] x g(x , q^2)1.94 x^-0.17 - 0.05 ( q^2/q_0 ^ 2 ) , q_0 ^ 2=4 ^ 2 .",
    "we consider the quark and antiquark transverse momenta in the meson to modify the leading - twist amplitude .",
    "the distribution amplitude @xmath24 is replaced in this case by a gaussian parameterization @xcite _ v(,)a^2_v .",
    "[ wave - l ] transverse momentum integration of ( [ wave - l ] ) leads the asymptotic form of a meson distribution amplitude @xmath29 . for the decay constants @xmath30 we take the values @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 mesons , respectively . for the transverse size parameter",
    "@xmath35 we use a value of @xmath36 which leads to an average transverse momentum of @xmath37 . for the @xmath34- meson production",
    "we take @xmath38 @xcite . +    in the quark propagators of the subprocess we consider the transverse momenta which are accompanied by the sudakov factor .",
    "the last factor suppresses contributions from the end - point regions , in which one of the partons entering the meson wave function becomes soft and factorization breaks down .",
    "the result of our calculations for the longitudinal cross sections of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 production is shown in fig .",
    "good agreement with experimental data extracted from @xmath39 in @xcite was obtained .",
    "thus , the perturbative approach with including a transverse quark momentum leads to agreement of the theoretical results with the experiment .",
    "now let us study the process of @xmath1 leptoproduction within the two - gluon exchange model .",
    "as we have discussed previously , this contribution is predominated at small @xmath40 by a gluon exchange . to study spin effects in diffractive hadron production",
    ", one must know the structure of the two - gluon coupling with the proton at small @xmath0 .",
    "the two - gluon coupling with the proton which describes transverse spin effects in the proton can be parametrized in the form @xcite @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the proton mass and @xmath43 is a gluon momentum . in the matrix structure ( [ ver ] ) we wrote only the terms with the maximal powers of a large proton momentum @xmath44 which are symmetric in the gluon indices @xmath45 .",
    "the structure proportional to @xmath46 determines the spin - non - flip contribution .",
    "the term @xmath47 leads to the transverse spin - flip at the vertex .",
    "the spin - dependent cross section of diffractive processes is expressed in terms of the soft gluon coupling ( [ ver ] ) which is convoluted with the hard hadron production amplitude .",
    "the spin - average and spin dependent cross sections with longitudinal polarization of a lepton and different polarization of a proton are determined by @xmath48 to calculate the cross sections , we integrate the amplitudes squared over the @xmath1 phase space .",
    "the spin - average and spin - dependent cross section can be written in the form @xmath49 here @xmath50 is a normalization function which is common for the spin average and spin dependent cross section ; @xmath51 is determined by a sum of graphs integrated over the gluon momenta @xmath43 and @xmath52    the contribution of the planar graphs to the function @xmath53 can be approximated as @xmath54 with @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "the details of calculations can be found in @xcite .",
    "connection of the two - gluon structures with gluon the gpd @xcite is shown in ( [ bqq ] ) .",
    "the contribution of all graphs to the function @xmath53 can be written as @xmath57 the function @xmath58 here has been calculated numerically .",
    "the same analysis was carried out for the spin - dependent cross sections .",
    "we find in the spin - dependent part the terms proportional to the scalar production @xmath59 and @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a transverse polarization of the proton @xmath62.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the spin - average cross section of the vector meson production at a small momentum transfer is approximately proportional to the @xmath63 function ( [ np ] ) which is connected with the generalized gluon distribution @xmath64 .",
    "we use the simple parameterization of the gpd as a product of the form factor and the ordinary gluon distribution @xmath65 a more general form of gpd like ( [ f1 ] ) can be used , but the enhancement factor which appears in this case at small @xmath0 will be canceled in the asymmetry . the form factor @xmath66 in ( [ b_g ] )",
    "is chosen as an electromagnetic form factor of the proton .",
    "such a simple choice can be justified by that the pomeron ",
    "proton vertex might be similar to the photon ",
    "proton coupling @xmath67    the energy dependence of the cross sections is determined by the pomeron contribution to the gluon distribution function at small @xmath0 @xmath68 here @xmath69 is a pomeron trajectory which is chosen in the form @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "these values are in accordance with the fit of the diffractive @xmath73 production by zeus @xcite .",
    "note that the form ( [ xgx ] ) is similar to ( [ xgxq2 ] ) .",
    "we shall discuss here our prediction for the polarized diffractive @xmath74 production determined by the @xmath60 term in ( [ nm ] ) .",
    "the results for the @xmath75 contribution to asymmetry can be found in @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry is determined by the ratio of spin  dependent and spin  average cross section ( [ spm ] ) ( see ( [ nm ] ) and ( [ np ] ) ) .",
    "it is approximately proportional to the ratio of the gluon distribution functions @xmath76 +    thus , to estimate the value of asymmetry , we must know the ratio of spin - dependent and spin - average structure functions .",
    "there are some models ( see e.g. @xcite ) that provide spin - flip effects which do not vanish at high energies .",
    "these models describe experimental data on single spin transverse asymmetry @xmath77 @xcite quite well .",
    "predictions of other models which lead to spin ",
    "flip effects in the pomeron amplitude were discussed , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "thus , the weak energy dependence of spin asymmetries in exclusive reactions is not now in contradiction with the experiment @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the gluon structure functions @xmath78 found in @xcite for elastic scattering will be used in our estimations of the asymmetry in diffractive hadron production .",
    "the term @xmath60 in the asymmetry is calculated for the case when the transverse jet momentum @xmath79 is parallel to the target polarization @xmath80 which gets the maximal value of asymmetry . to observe this contribution to asymmetry",
    ", it is necessary to distinguish experimentally the quark and antiquark jets .",
    "this can be realized presumably by the charge of the leading particles in the jet which should be connected in charge with the quark produced in the photon - gluon fusion .",
    "if we do not separate events with @xmath79 for the quark jet , the resulting asymmetry will be equal to zero because the transverse momentum of the quark and antiquark are equal and opposite in sign .    the predicted asymmetry for light quark production at erhic energies is shown in fig .",
    "the asymmetry for heavy quark production is approximately of the same order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the expected asymmetries are not small .",
    "possible event kinematics in the erhic asymmetric system was estimated for @xmath81 .",
    "the energy in lepton - proton system @xmath82 in this case .",
    "it was found that the final proton moves practically in the same direction as the initial one .",
    "the jets from the final quarks have large angles and can be detected by the erhic spectrometer .",
    "this shows a possibility of studying the polarized gluon distribution @xmath83 in future erhic experiment .",
    "we conclude that the modified perturbative approach which considers transverse degrees of freedom and sudakov suppressions in the subprocess gives a quantitative fit of the @xmath84 cross section for the @xmath33 and @xmath34 meson production .",
    "this approach can be used to regularize the infrared divergencies @xcite in the @xmath85 and @xmath86 amplitudes .",
    "the analysis of @xmath87 asymmetry in the diffractive @xmath1 leptoproduction at small @xmath0 at erhic energies is based on the two - gluon spin - dependent exchange model .",
    "the spin asymmetry is found to be proportional to the ratio of polarized gluon gpd ( [ cltqq ] ) .",
    "for the @xmath1 production we have two different terms in the @xmath2 asymmetry which are proportional to @xmath88 and the term @xmath59 ( [ nm ] ) .",
    "these terms in the asymmetry have different kinematic properties and can be studied independently .",
    "the term @xmath89 in asymmetry has a coefficient @xmath90 that is predicted to be large about 0.3 - 0.5 .",
    "this asymmetry might be an excellent object to study transverse effects in the proton gluon coupling . however , its experimental study is not so simple . to find nonzero asymmetry in this case ,",
    "it is necessary to distinguish quark and antiquark jets and to have a possibility of studying the azimuthal asymmetry structure .",
    "the expected @xmath2 asymmetry for the term @xmath91 is not small too .",
    "the predicted coefficient @xmath92 in this case is about 0.1 - 0.2 @xcite .",
    "note that the asymmetry of the same order of magnitude was predicted for the diffractive @xmath1 production in polarized proton- proton interaction @xcite .",
    "these results for light quark production can be used at small @xmath93 where the contribution of the quark gpd is expected to be small .",
    "thus , our estimations show that the coefficient @xmath94 in double spin asymmetry for longitudinally polarized leptons and transversely polarized protons might not be small .",
    "this shows possibility to study @xmath2 asymmetry at the future erhic spectrometer where the information on the polarized gluon gpd can be obtained .",
