    "to better understand the nature of any class of extragalactic object , an accurate knowledge of the luminosity function ( lf ) over a wide range of absolute magnitudes and covering a range of redshifts is necessary . for active galactic nuclei ( agn )",
    "this has been attempted using quasars at the brighter , primarily high redshift end and seyfert galaxy nuclei , considered to be their intrinsically fainter counterparts , at the low luminosity , low redshift end ( cheng et al .",
    "1985 ; huchra & burg 1992 ) .",
    "understanding how the faint end of the agn lf evolves is of particular importance for determining the frequency and total space density of these objects at earlier epochs .",
    "models for quasar evolution can be much better constrained with accurate knowledge of the shape at the faint end .",
    "koo ( 1986 ) explains how many of the models are difficult to descriminate when only luminous quasars are included since this end of the lf is a power - law with a slope that is almost identical at all redshifts .",
    "furthermore , agn are likely contributors to the x - ray background and several studies have determined the contribution of luminous quasars to the diffuse background ( e.g. schmidt & green 1986 ) .",
    "how the low luminosity agns ( llagns ) contribute to the diffuse x - ray background has been a question of interest for some time ( elvis et al .",
    "1984 ; koratkar et al .",
    "an accurate understanding of the behavior of the faint agn lf and its evolution would help us to determine the global significance of their contribution to the soft x - ray background",
    ".    how then can llagns be observed in higher redshift galaxies ?",
    "the use of spectroscopic techniques becomes quite difficult at moderate redshifts .",
    "even locally , the observation of broad emission lines , indicative of seyfert 1 activity , or emission line flux ratios indicating seyfert 2 or liner activity requires that the nucleus dominate the galaxy light ( e.g. huchra & burg 1992 ) or have adequate spatial resolution for subtraction of the galaxy light from the nucleus ( ho et al .",
    "at moderate redshifts llagns become virtually impossible to observe from the ground becoming indistinguishable from central regions of enhanced star formation or finite central density cusps of spheroidal components .    the medium deep survey ( mds ) ( griffiths et al .",
    "1994 ) is an hst key project yielding two to four parallel wfpc2 exposures per week , each containing @xmath8300 galaxies down to v@xmath8 23.5 mag .",
    "this survey provides an ideal sample of distant field galaxies for which morphology and galaxy light profiles can be studied at sub - kiloparsec resolution .",
    "typical galaxy redshifts extend to z@xmath00.8 .",
    "the set of cycle 4 , 5 and 6 images consists of @xmath8150 fields with both v(f606w ) and i(f814w ) exposures .",
    "this database provides a unique opportunity to search for morphological evidence of agn or other compact nuclear activity such as starbursts .",
    "the nuclear activity of seyfert galaxies manifests itself morphologically as an unresolved point source in the nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "this is due to the fact that most of the emission is originating from a small region typically a few parsecs in diameter .",
    "for seyfert 2 nuclei the emission is probably originating over the broader narrow - line region but is still highly concentrated at the nucleus having nuclear fwhm@xmath6200 pc ( nelson et al . 1996 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the recent wfpc2 study of seyferts by malkan et al .",
    "they were able to resolve the nuclei of almost all local seyfert 2 galaxies whereas most local seyfert 1 nuclei remained unresolved .",
    "the physical size of an unresolved region in a wfpc2 image at z@xmath90.8 easily encompasses that for both types of seyfert nuclei .",
    "other enhancements of this size in a galaxy profile would include starburst regions and nuclear hii regions .",
    "nuclear starbursts typically have sizes of a few hundred parsecs ( e.g. weedman et al .",
    "1981 for ngc 7714 ) and nuclear hii regions may be even smaller .",
    "these stellar enhancements in a galaxy light profile would appear unresolved over the redshift range of interest ( 0.2@xmath6z@xmath60.8 ) unless h@xmath10 is very high .",
    "the typical late - type spiral bulge , however , has a diameter of @xmath81 kpc ( boroson 1981 ) which is resolved in the hst images .",
    "our study includes galaxies in 70 wfpc2 fields which have been modeled to search for unresolved nuclei likely to be agn or compact regions of star formation , i.e. starbursts .",
    "the galaxy modeling is based on maximum likelihood estimates used to extract quantitative morphological and structural parameters of the faint galaxy images .",
    "all galaxies to i@xmath621.5 in 64 mds fields and 5 groth survey strip fields ( e. groth , p.i . , prop i d 5090 ) as well as the hubble deep field to i@xmath623.5 ( williams et al .",
    "1996 ) have been modeled in this way to reveal an unresolved nuclear component when present .",
    "selection of agn using this technique results in a magnitude - limited sample which is less biased towards galaxies dominated by the nucleus than are spectroscopically selected samples . in this way , we probe the intrinisically fainter population of agn and starbursts out to intermediate redshifts for the first look at how this population of objects evolves .    in sarajedini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( hereafter referred to as paper i ) , we discuss in detail the selection of fields and the procedure for fitting the galaxy light profiles .",
    "we also describe the criterion used for selecting those galaxies containing compact nuclei along with various simulations to determine the uniqueness of the galaxy model .",
    "in addition , we present in paper i the ground - based spectroscopic data for about one third of our sample and describe the procedure of estimating redshifts for the remaining sample with @xmath11@xmath12@xmath90.1 using v - i color , i magnitude , and the bulge - to - total luminosity ratio .",
    "in this paper we focus on the analysis of the sample selected in paper i. we discuss the properties of the host galaxies such as color , magnitude , size and hubble type .",
    "these properties are then compared with those of local seyferts and starburst galaxies .",
    "the colors of the nuclei are used to differentiate between seyfert - like nuclei and young starburst nuclei based on colors from representative spectra of these objects . using this information ,",
    "we calculate the upper limit luminosity function for llagn in the magnitude range -20@xmath9m@xmath7@xmath9 - 14 in two redshift bins out to z=0.8 and compare it with the lfs of local seyferts and moderate redshift qsos",
    ". we also comment on the likely contribution of these nuclei to the soft x - ray background .",
    "the sample of 101 galaxies containing unresolved nuclei described in paper i is large enough to study , with some statistical significance , the morphological and photometric characteristics of the nuclei and host galaxies .",
    "here we examine the properites of the hosts and compare them with local agn and starburst host galaxies .",
    "the colors of the nuclei themselves are discussed in section 3 and are used to answer questions concerning the nature of this population of objects .",
    "when discussing the host galaxy types for the point source nuclei galaxies in our sample , it is very important to determine how well the bulge component is measured in these galaxies .",
    "this measurement effect was examined using monte - carlo simulations described in paper i. the galaxies used in the simulation were originally fit with disk+bulge models before the simulated nuclear point source was added .",
    "based on this @xmath13 @xmath14 disk+bulge fitting , we have a known  input \" bulge - to - bulge+disk ( b / b+d ) luminosity ratio which can be compared with the measured b / b+d luminosity ratio when the simulated point source is detected in the galaxy .",
    "these simulations show that for detections of point sources greater than 20% of the total galaxy light , the bulge is never detected regardless of the input bulge value .",
    "our fitting technique is unable to separate and measure the bulge and point source components when the point source is a large contributor ( @xmath1 20% ) of the total galaxy light .",
    "this is not the case for fainter point sources ( @xmath6 20% ) where the bulge is more accurately measured .",
    "we note that in all of the cases where the input bulge - to - total was zero , it was also measured as zero .    for point sources fainter than 20% of the galaxy light where the input bulge - to - total ratio is non - zero ,",
    "we determine how often is it measured accurately and how often is it measured as zero .",
    "figure 1a shows the fraction of galaxies where no bulge is detected for the simulated galaxies as a function of the actual input bulge - to - total luminosity ratio .",
    "the error bars represent the poisson statistics based on the number of points in each bin . from this figure",
    "we see that as the bulge becomes more significant , it is more likely to be measured accurately and not go undetected .",
    "we can apply this statistical result to the real sample of compact nuclei galaxies to determine what fraction of these galaxies may actually contain a significant bulge where none was measured in the fitted model . of the 101 compact nuclei galaxies in our sample , only 8 have point source - to - total luminosity percentages greater than 20% . for these 8 ,",
    "no bulge is detected as we would expect based on the simulations .",
    "these galaxies , however , could contain a significant bulge component which is not being properly measured due to the bright point source nucleus",
    ". a hidden bulge component in these galaxies may be as much as 50% of the total light but is probably not dominating the host galaxy since spiral structure is seen upon examination of the galaxy images .",
    "the remaining 93 galaxies have point source - to - total luminosity percentages less than 20% . of these ,",
    "57 are measured to have no bulge component .",
    "we can estimate the fraction of the 57 that are statistically likely to contain a bulge based on figure 1a . in this figure , the fraction of galaxies having measured bulge - to - bulge+disk luminosity ratios between 0 and 0.2 is high , indicating that a large fraction of host galaxies having bulge components as large as 20% will be measured as having no bulge .",
    "our 57 hosts with no detected bulge may contain bulges that are up to 20% of the total host galaxy light .",
    "therefore , our first grouping of host galaxy types are those with 0@xmath9(b / b+d)@xmath150.2 since it is difficult to differentiate these galaxy types with higher resolution .",
    "there are a total of 79 hosts in this grouping .",
    "there are 9 galaxies measured with 0.2@xmath9(b / b+d)@xmath150.5 . according to figure 1a",
    ", 59% @xmath29% of galaxies with this size bulge will be measured with no bulge when a point source ( of less than 20% the galaxy light ) is detected .",
    "if 9 galaxies have 0.2@xmath9(b / b+d)@xmath150.5 then as many as 9 to 19 galaxies of this type will be measured with no bulge component .",
    "three host galaxies fall in the 0.5@xmath9(b / b+d)@xmath150.8 bin .",
    "figure 1a indicates that 21% @xmath29% of these galaxy types will be measured as having no bulge .",
    "based on this percentage , we would expect one additional host galaxy with 0.5@xmath9(b / b+d)@xmath150.8 to be measured as having no bulge component .    according to this analysis ,",
    "the 57 host galaxies measured with no bulge component are likely to be comprised of 9 to 19 galaxies with 0.2@xmath9(b / b+d)@xmath150.5 and 1 galaxy with 0.5@xmath9(b / b+d)@xmath150.8 .",
    "removing these 10 to 20 galaxies from the b / b+d=0 bin allows us to statistically redistribute the host galaxy types based on our previous simulations .",
    "the solid line in figure 1b is the measured b / b+d distribution for the 101 host galaxies containing compact nuclei .",
    "the dashed lines are the statistically redistributed histograms where the 2 lines represent the two extremes of the distribution . here",
    "we have assumed that the 8 host galaxies with point source nuclei greater than 20% of the galaxy light have bulges less than 50% of the host galaxy light and could lie entirely in the 0@xmath9(b / b+d)@xmath150.2 bin or the 0.2@xmath9(b / b+d)@xmath150.5 bin .",
    "the dashed lines in figure 1b indicate that the actual number of host galaxies having 0@xmath9(b / b+d)@xmath150.2 is likely to be from 58% to 76% of the 101 host galaxies in our sample .",
    "eighteen to 36% may have 0.2@xmath9(b / b+d)@xmath150.5 .",
    "only 6% are likely to have b / b+d@xmath10.5 .",
    "we note , however , that the incompleteness estimates for detecting point sources in galaxies containing a substantial bulge is high . in paper",
    "i we show that the completeness is typically 25 to 40% for galaxies with 0.5@xmath9(b / b+d)@xmath151.0 . therefore , there are likely to be 2.5 to 4 times as many point source nuclei present than were actually found in galaxies with large bulges .",
    "figure 1b shows that even at the extremes , the majority of host galaxies ( 58 - 76% ) have small bulges indicating late - type spiral galaxy hosts .",
    "one - fifth to one - third may be early - type spirals with bulges greater than 20% of the galaxy light but less than 50% .",
    "we detect only 6% with bulges",
    "greater than 50% of the host galaxy light .",
    "incompleteness corrections could increase this from 6% to @xmath810% ( see discussion in the following section ) .    to compare our sample with local host galaxy types of seyferts and starbursts",
    ", we will assume a galaxy with b / b+d@xmath90.2 is a late type spiral ( sc to sb ) and 0.2@xmath9(b / b+d)@xmath150.5 is an early type spiral ( sa to s0 ) .",
    "although hubble type does not depend on bulge / disk measurement alone we can estimate the approximate type based on a study of the luminosity distribution in nearby spiral galaxies ( boroson 1981 ) .",
    "the cfa seyfert galaxies studied in mcleod & rieke ( 1995 ) had hubble types ranging from s0 to sc with no elliptical hosts .",
    "45% were found in late type spirals and the remaining 55% in early type spirals .",
    "these seyferts , although considered low - luminosity agn , are likely to have intrinsically brighter nuclei than our sample since they were selected spectroscopically .",
    "however , a similar distribution is found in the ho et al .",
    "( 1997a ) study of  dwarf \" seyfert nuclei in nearby galaxies .",
    "they find about 8% of the dwarf nuclei reside in ellipticals , while 46% are in s0 to sa galaxies and another 46% reside in sb through sm galaxies .",
    "in contrast , balzano ( 1983 ) finds that for starburst nuclei in local galaxies , 3% are in ellipticals , 30% are in early type spirals , and 67% are in late type spirals .",
    "locally , starburst galaxies appear to favor late type spirals more so than dwarf seyfert nuclei and this causes the local starburst host type distribution to more closely resemble our host galaxy type distribution .",
    "however , our distribution would also be consistent with some combination of local seyfert nuclei hosts and starburst nuclei hosts which is the expected mix of object types in our sample .",
    "as part of this study , we also note the galaxies in our survey for which we obtained spectra and compare their bulge / total measurements with hubble - types as estimated from their spectra .",
    "kennicutt ( 1992 ) presents integrated spectra of nearby galaxies and compares emission and absorption features with hubble class for normal and peculiar galaxies for a range of galaxy types .",
    "he finds that early - type galaxies from e s to sa s have similar absorption feature spectra .",
    "+ [ nii ] and [ sii ] become prominent for sb s and later types . in sc s through irregulars , we see many more emission lines such as [ oiii ] , h@xmath17 and [ oii ] .    in our spectra , 10 galaxies had wavelength coverage for h@xmath16 detection .",
    "h@xmath16 emission was observed in 9 of those galaxies all of which had bulge / total values less than 0.06 , consistent with late - type spirals .",
    "the one without h@xmath16 detected had bulge / total=0.3 which is consistent with an early - type spiral galaxy .",
    "for these cases , our bulge / total measurements appear to be consistent with spectroscopic classifications for these galaxies .    out of the 29 spectra for which redshifts could be determined ,",
    "23 showed emission lines while 6 were only absorption spectra .",
    "ninety - one percent of the emission line spectra galaxies had bulge / total@xmath90.2 and 67% of the absorption spectra had bulge / total@xmath10.2 .",
    "again , these statistics indicate that the majority of galaxies in our sample with measured spectra have spectral types consistent with their bulge / total measurements .",
    "it is interesting to compare the host galaxies of our compact nuclei with the entire sample of 1033 galaxies from the mds , groth strip , and hdf .",
    "as mentioned before , the measurement of bulge / total luminosity ratio gives us an estimate of the probable hubble type for a galaxy .",
    "figure 2 is the histogram of bulge / total values for the entire sample of galaxies in our survey .",
    "the hatched region is the true normalized histogram while the dotted line represents the fraction of galaxies found in each bulge / total bin defined in the previous subsection .",
    "this dotted line can be compared to the host galaxy bulge / bulge+disk distributions in figure 1b .",
    "all of the possible host galaxy distributions in figure 1b are weighted towards later - type galaxies as compared to the total galaxy sample . in figure 2 , a larger fraction of host galaxies have 0@xmath9(b / b+d)@xmath150.5 than survey galaxies . although the largest fraction of survey galaxies also have 0@xmath9(b / b+d)@xmath150.5 , there are many more with 0.5@xmath9(b / b+d)@xmath151.0 than what is seen in the host galaxy sample .",
    "this apparent discrepancy could be attributed in part to incompleteness in detecting nuclei in galaxies with large bulges .",
    "we can correct for this effect using conservative completeness estimates calculated in paper i ( 90% completeness for ( b / b+d)=0 , 55% completeness for 0@xmath15(b / b+d)@xmath90.4 , 43% for 0.4@xmath15(b / b+d)@xmath90.8 , and 38% for ( b / b+d)@xmath180.8 ) . adjusting our numbers in each b / b+d bin",
    "accordingly indicates an increase in the number of host galaxies with 0.5@xmath9(b / b+d)@xmath151.0 from 6% to @xmath810% @xmath22.5% .",
    "this fraction is still significantly lower than the @xmath815% of all survey galaxies of this type .",
    "based on this distribution , the host galaxies containing compact nuclei do appear to favor galaxies with bulges contributing less than 50% of the total galaxy light .",
    "we investigate how the compact nuclei galaxies vary in angular size and apparent magnitude from the entire sample of survey galaxies in figure 3 .",
    "figure 3a shows the angular size ( natural log of the half - light radius ) in arcsec vs. the apparent i band magnitude of the survey galaxies ( open circles ) and the host galaxies ( filled circles ) .",
    "the typical limiting magnitude for mds and groth strip fields at i@xmath021.5 is apparent in the diagram .",
    "most of the fainter galaxies are from the hubble deep field .",
    "the smallest host galaxies are also from the hdf and are as small as 2 pixels ( 0.2@xmath19 ) in radius .",
    "it appears that few of the large but faint galaxies , possibly low surface brightness galaxies , appear to host point source nuclei .",
    "this trend is further revealed in figure 3b which is the normalized distribution of the half - light radii for the host galaxies ( hatched region ) and the non - host galaxies ( solid line ) .",
    "the host galaxy distribution peaks at a smaller half light radius ( hlr@xmath00.45@xmath19 ) than the non - host galaxies ( hlr@xmath00.72@xmath19 ) and also cuts off at a half - light radius of @xmath81.9@xmath19 .",
    "a ks test conducted on both the size and magnitude distributions of the two populations indicates that they are drawn from different parent populations at the 80% significance level .",
    "a possible explanation is that these galaxies may not contain enough mass to sustain a starburst nucleus or agn .",
    "recent work by schombert ( 1998 ) has shown that hi - rich , low surface brightness galaxies have a greater chance of hosting llagn than other magnitude limited , late - type galaxies .",
    "this seems to indicate that the gas mass is an important factor in the existance of an active nucleus . additionally , some mechanism is usually required to transport fuel to the nucleus .",
    "mihos et al .",
    "( 1997 ) shows through numerical simulations that low surface brightness galaxies are stable against the growth of bar instabilities , inhibiting a strong inflow of gas to the galaxy center for fueling a nuclear starburst or agn .",
    "although our nuclei are intrinsically faint , this observation implies that some limiting mass or ability to transport matter to the nucleus is necessary for their formation and duration .",
    "optically selected agn have been observed to avoid edge - on spirals ( keel 1980 ; mckleod & rieke 1995 ) . figure 4 shows the distribution of axis ratios for the disks of our host galaxies .",
    "we have included only those hosts that are disk - dominated , containing bulges less than 20% of the total galaxy light .",
    "the distribution is normalized by dividing the axis ratio distribution of host galaxies by the same distribution for the total sample of survey galaxies which are also disk - dominated .",
    "this normalizes the axis ratio distribution so that each bin represents the fraction of all disk - dominated galaxies with the specified axis ratio which contain compact nuclei .",
    "there is an observed drop in the fraction of hosts with disk axis ratios ( b / a ) @xmath60.4 .",
    "however , this drop is much less significant than that observed in the spectroscopically selected cfa seyferts .",
    "lawrence and elvis ( 1982 ) found that an inclination bias does not appear in hard x - ray selected samples of agn .",
    "they conclude that selection biases seen in other samples are due to obscuration in a flattened disk parallel to the plane of the host galaxy .",
    "although the axis ratio distribution of our data reveals a slight bias against edge - on host galaxies , our morphological selection technique appears to be less affected by this type of obscuration .",
    "finally , we examine how the colors of the host galaxies compare with the non - host galaxies .",
    "first we must understand the accuracy of the host colors .",
    "our monte carlo simulations in paper i show that the bulge component of a host galaxy is often undetected when a nuclear point source is fit . at the same time",
    ", these simulations show that the point source magnitudes are well determined within the errors .",
    "therefore , the undetected bulge component does not appear to be mistakenly measured as part of the point source .",
    "how then does the missing bulge component effect the magnitude and consequently the color measurement for the host galaxy ?",
    "we again look at the monte - carlo simulations from paper i to compare the @xmath20 galaxy colors to those measured for the galaxy when a simulated point source is detected in the nucleus . for 389 galaxies in the simulation where the point source nucleus was detected ( in both or only one filter ) the distribution of color errors",
    "was centered around zero with @xmath11@xmath21=0.37 .",
    "this indicates that we are not seeing a systematic offset between the measured and true color of the host galaxy which might be expected if the bulge were being completely ignored in the model fitting .",
    "instead , when the bulge is not detected , it seems to be absorbed in the disk component such that the host galaxy color is not systematically affected . keeping in mind the typical errors in determining the host galaxy color , we compare them to those of galaxies in our survey without unresolved nuclear components .",
    "figure 5a is the color - magnitude diagram for the galaxies in our survey where the open circles are non - host galaxies and the filled circles are the host galaxies .",
    "we have removed the color contribution of the nucleus from the integrated galaxy color to produce the host galaxy v - i color . in order to directly compare the sample of host galaxies with a similar representation of the survey galaxies , a random subset of the 1033 survey galaxies",
    "was selected based on the host galaxy distribution in figure 1b ( short - dashed line ) .",
    "this allows us to compare our host galaxy colors to those of survey galaxies morphologically similar to our hosts .",
    "figure 5b shows the normalized histogram of the v - i colors for the compact nuclei host galaxies ( hatched region ) where the subset of similar survey galaxies is represented by the solid line . a ks test for these color distributions",
    "yields a probability of 0.43 , where low ks probabilities indicate that two populations are not drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "this result indicates that the two distributions are not statistically different .",
    "the mean color for the host galaxies is @xmath22@xmath21=0.97 while the mean survey galaxy color is @xmath22@xmath21=1.03 . in general",
    ", we find that the host galaxy colors are like those of other morphologically similar galaxies in the field with a slight tendency to be bluer .      using the spectroscopic and photometric redshifts for each galaxy containing an unresolved point source nucleus",
    ", we can examine the absolute magnitudes of the host galaxies as they compare with other galaxies .",
    "figure 6a is the histogram of absolute rest - frame b magnitudes for the 101 host galaxies which contain unresolved nuclei using h@xmath10=75 km / s / mpc and q@xmath10=0 .",
    "the b - band luminosities for the galaxies were derived from their v magnitude , v - i color and redshift .",
    "this information is used to select a non - evolving model spectral energy distribution from the set described in gronwall and koo ( 1995 ) .",
    "the models are based on those of bruzual and charlot ( 1993 ) .",
    "the k - corrections are small ( typically @xmath60.3 mag ) since the v magnitude is roughly rest - frame b at the median redshift of our survey ( z@xmath00.35 ) .    our luminosity distribution peaks at m@xmath7@xmath0 - 20.4 which is approximately l@xmath23 . for comparison with the following samples",
    ", this corresponds to a peak at m@xmath7@xmath0 - 21.3 with h@xmath10=50 km / s / mpc .",
    "the luminosity distribution of normal spiral galaxies peaks at m@xmath7=-20.6 ( h@xmath10=50 km / s / mpc ) ( christensen 1975 ) , somewhat fainter than our sample of compact nuclei galaxies .",
    "interestingly , yee ( 1983 ) found the peak luminosity of seyfert hosts from the markarian survey to be m@xmath7=-21.3 @xmath20.8 which is strikingly similar to our sample . from this observation",
    "he argues that the seyfert phenomenon tends to occur more often in the luminous end of the spiral population .",
    "according to the present study , this trend may also hold true for galaxies hosting compact nuclei . this brighter absolute magnitude for agn hosts",
    "is also seen , though to a lesser degree , for x - ray selected agn where the peak luminosity is m@xmath7=-20.9 ( kotilainen & ward 1994 ) .",
    "we can compare our distribution to the dwarf seyfert nuclei hosts of ho et al .",
    "( 1997a ) ( figure 6b ) and the distribution of galaxies containing hii nuclei from ho et al .",
    "( 1997b ) ( figure 6c ) which were derived using h@xmath10=75 km / s / mpc .",
    "these samples provide an interesting comparison since the @xmath24 luminosities are closer to those of our sample than other spectroscopically selected agn .",
    "the luminosity distributions are similar among the three samples .",
    "although the peak luminosities are close , our sample does appear to drop off faster on the low luminosity side of the distribution .",
    "this is most likely caused by the nature of our magnitude - limited survey as it is observed over a range in redshift .",
    "as we observe at higher redshifts , intrinsically fainter galaxies are missed .",
    "accounting for this discrepancy , we observe no evidence for evolution in the luminosity of agn or starburst host galaxies out to z@xmath00.8 .",
    "model fitting of the point source component allows us to separate the color of the nucleus from that of the host galaxy .",
    "of the 101 nuclear point sources detected , 93 were detected in the i filter image , 80 were detected in the v filter image , and 72 were detected in both filters allowing for a v - i color to be determined .",
    "this result leaves 29 point sources with no color information .",
    "there are a few reasons for not detecting the point source in one of the filters such as 1 ) the point source is too faint in one filter , 2 ) the point source does not converge properly in one filter making its magnitude unreliable , and 3 ) the image is too noisy in one filter for a point source to be detected .",
    "of these 29 , 5 were not detected in the other filter because of non - convergence of the model , 7 were not detected because of additional noise elements in that filter , and 17 were not detected because the point source was too faint in that filter .",
    "for these 17 , we can determine a limit for the point source color assuming the point source in the other filter is fainter than 1% of the total galaxy light .",

    "the 17 points with a point source color limit , due to non - detection in one filter , are marked with an arrow . within the errors of the point source colors , the majority of point source nuclei are the same color as the underlying host galaxy .",
    "the large errorbars on the point source colors cause the correlation coefficient between the point source and host galaxy colors to be small indicating a low probability of correlation . in figure",

    "it is also interesting to see how the nuclear colors compare with the color of the bulge where it is detected in both the v and i filters .",
    "again , we first must understand the errors in the bulge colors as determined from the monte - carlo simulations . based on comparison of the input bulge colors of the simulation galaxies to the measured bulge colors when a point source nucleus is detected",

    "we have applied the determined bulge color error and point source color errors . because these errorbars are so large , this figure is not useful for studying individual cases . in figure 8b",
    "we show the generalized histogram of the color difference between the point source and bulge components .",
    "the histogram is made in the way described for figure 7b .",
    "this figure allows us to observe any trends in the color difference while taking into account the errors in the individual points .",
    "the mean color difference between the bulge and the point source nucleus is ( v - i)@xmath26(v - i)@xmath27@xmath00.5 .",
    "this indicates that in general , the nuclear colors are bluer than the bulge .",
    "this is expected if the bulge represents an older population than the nucleus or if the nucleus has typical non - thermal source colors .",
    "studying the nuclear colors allows us to look more deeply into the question of their nature . in the case of detection in a bulge dominated system ,",
    "the color of the nucleus plays a role . as discussed above",
    ", we require the nucleus to be a different color from that of the underlying bulge to ensure that it is not merely an unresolved region of the bulge .",
    "are there objects , besides seyferts and starbursts , that could appear unresolved in an elliptical or bulge dominated galaxy and would be composed of a different stellar population from that of the bulge so that it would appear a different color ?",
    "one additional possibility is a merger remnant .",
    "theoretical and observational evidence suggests that major mergers , where the galaxies are of almost equal mass , form elliptical remnants ( hibbard et al .",
    "1994 and references therein ) . in the case of the merger remnant",

    "there is also the possibility that minor merger remnants in the centers of galaxies could reveal themselves as unresolved nuclei of a different stellar population than the host galaxy .",

    "this figure is useful for studying how the lf at fainter absolute magnitudes compares with the bright end and allows us to investigate the nature of the luminosity function evolution .",
    "there is some indication in this figure that the shape of the lf changes between the low and high redshift bins when we consider both the low ( this study ) and high ( hartwick & schade ) luminosity points . if we assume that our upper limit lfs represent llagns which are of the same nature as the brighter qsos , any change in the overall shape of the lf would argue against both pure density evolution and pure luminosity evolution for these objects .",

    "figure 14a shows the lfs from figure 13 with the double power - law model fit to the high luminosity data shown as the dotted line .",
    "the fitted parameters from pei ( 1995 ) are @xmath17@xmath58=1.64@xmath20.18 , @xmath17@xmath59=3.52@xmath20.11 , z@xmath60=2.75@xmath20.05 , @xmath11@xmath60=0.93@xmath20.03 , log(l@xmath60/l@xmath61)=13.03@xmath20.10 , and log(@xmath3@xmath60/mpc@xmath62)=-6.05@xmath20.15 .",

    "we have calculated the model at the median redshift for each of the two redshift bins to overlay with the lfs .",
    "although the fit to the high luminsity lfs is very good , this model does not fit our lfs at lower luminosities .",
    "the model predicts lower number counts than our observations in the low redshift bin at -19@xmath9m@xmath7@xmath9 - 16 and in the high redshift bin at -19@xmath9m@xmath7@xmath9 - 17 .",
    "we also note that the model predicts lower number counts than that observed by hb as inferred from the agreement in figure 12 between their lf and our data over the common absolute magnitude range .",
    "because our luminosity function is only an upper limit on the agn lf at moderate redshifts , it is not necessarily in disagreement with the extrapolated number counts of the model fits . as described previously ,",
    "even if we assume that the nuclei in our survey are non - thermal in nature , our lf is likely to include an increased population of low - luminosity agns such as liners and faint seyfert 2 nuclei .",
    "the extrapolated results of this model using the fitted parameters described above may be consistent with the population of faint qsos and seyfert 1 galaxies but may underestimate the total number of agn including seyfert 2s and liners at m@xmath7@xmath1 - 22 .    in figure 14b",

    "our two brightest lf bins , which are consistent with the hb local lf , largely influence the fit in this manner .",
    "if the two data sets being combined here are actually representing the same type of active nucleus , this result indicates that the double power - law model assuming pure luminosity evolution is not the best representation of the data .",
    "the transistion region between the low and high luminosity data appears to require a model with additional variables for adequate fitting of this portion of the lf .",
    "this result leads to the following question : without considering the bright quasar data from harwick & schade , how well does pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) model our faint lf over the redshift range to z=0.8 ? we fit a simple power - law to our low and high redshift lfs and determine the amount of ple necessary to adequately model the data .",
    "a power - law is fit to both the high and low redshift lfs from -18@xmath6m@xmath7@xmath6 - 14 of the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the slope of the log@xmath3-m relation and is found to be 0.079@xmath20.066 .",
    "we find the mean increase in log@xmath3 over this magnitude range is 0.4 .",
    "this @xmath67log@xmath3 divided by @xmath66 gives the change in magnitude , @xmath67m=5.1@xmath68 .",

    "this simple calculation shows that the amount of ple necessary to account for the observed density increase is unreasonably large and unlikely to explain the observations .",
    "the fact that our lf is only an upper limit probably does little to remedy the flatness of the faint end of the agn lf .",
    "any population of objects which may be included in our survey , such as intermediate aged starburst nuclei or minor merger remnants , is likely to have a luminosity function with a negative slope at the faint end similar to that observed in the normal galaxy lf .",
    "if this is the case , subtracting an lf of this shape from our upper limit would result in further flattening of the faint end of the agn lf .",
    "in this section we address the implications the observed number density of compact nuclei in our survey has for the lifetimes of llagn and the fraction of present - day spiral galaxies that may host agn of low luminosities .",
    "we first make the assumption that the observed number density increase with redshift is caused by the evolution of llagns .",
    "as we will describe further in the following section , we assume a gaussian density evolution equation for these objects consistent with the observed mild density evolution to z=0.8 but turning over at z=2.3 ( see equation 16 ) . at their peak density at z=2.3 ,",

    "if our sample consists entirely of llagns , what fraction of present - day galaxies are likely to have contained an llagn at some point in their lives ? typically our nuclei are found in spiral galaxies with absolute magnitudes in the range -20.5@xmath9m@xmath7@xmath9 - 18.5 . using the lf of marzke et al .",
    "( 1994 ) for spiral galaxies , the number of local spirals in this absolute magnitude range is 9@xmath7210@xmath51 per mpc@xmath73 .",

    "this result has interesting implications on the search for agn in local galaxy nuclei .",
    "quasars have long been known as strong x - ray emitters and statistically significant samples have been selected through x - ray surveys ( e.g. giacconi et al .",
    "how quasars and their low - luminosity counterparts contribute to the diffuse x - ray background has been a question of interest for some time . in particular ,",
    "low - luminosity agns are considered good candidates for explaining the origin of the soft x - ray background ( 0.2 - 4.0 kev ) .",

    "they note that any substantial evolution would dramatically increase this value .",
    "other studies indicate that 30% to 90% of the background at 2 kev originates from agns ( boyle et al 1993 ) but with the brightest agn making up 30% .",
    "could the rest of the soft background be comprised of llagn ?",
    "we calculate the likely contribution of the compact nuclei in our survey to the x - ray background based on assumptions about the x - ray nature of the nuclei .",

    "@xmath94 the distribution of absolute magnitudes for the host galaxies peaks at m@xmath7@xmath0 - 21.3 with h@xmath10=50 km / s / mpc which is very similar to that for local seyfert hosts .",

    "when compared with the bright quasar lfs from harwick & schade ( 1990 ) , the overall shape of the lf appears to change from low to high redshift arguing against pure density and pure luminosity evolution if our lfs represent the intrinisically fainter counterparts of qsos .",

    "mechanisms are required within the host galaxy to provide fuel for the nuclear activity .",
    "many such mechanisms have been proposed such as bars , galaxy - galaxy interactions , and other morphological disturbances .",
    "these types of disturbances have been well studied in local groups of galaxies giving only the current picture of how host galaxy morphology relates to nuclear activity .",
    "studying a population of active galaxies at earlier epochs will help us understand how such fueling mechanisms evolve on a global scale over several gigayears .",
    "for example , determining the frequency of bars in agn / starburst hosts to z@xmath00.8 would allow us to trace the global evolution of bars in initiating nuclear activity .",
    "if a higher frequency of bars is detected at high z while decreasing towards lower z , the typical duration of a bar in an active galaxy as well as the likely formation epoch can be estimated .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the lack of a bar / agn connection observed locally ( mcleod & rieke 1995 ; ho et al .",
    "if the bar frequency remains constant with z , bars might be forming at a rate close to the rate at which they dissolve .",
    "another globally interesting question can be answered by studying the control sample of field galaxies . since",
    "many galaxies may have experienced episodes of rapid star formation , tracing the evolution of bars and other asymmetries in the control sample will help us understand when and how these perturbations have affected the general population of galaxies .",
    "we can also determine how the presence of a bar affects the agn / starburst luminosity .    in order to more directly compare the results of this survey to spectroscopic surveys",
    ", the morphologies of these survey galaxies must be examined in the same way as our hst imaged galaxies .",
    "such a study will bring to light the differences and biases in these survey techniques .",
    "high resolution ground - based images for a sample of local low - luminosity seyfert galaxies would allow us to study the nuclear regions and determine the fraction in which the agn can be morphologically detected . likewise , hst images are available for many fields where spectroscopic follow - up has been obtained with the cfht and keck telescopes .",
    "spectroscopic selection of active galaxies in these surveys can then be compared with the morphological evidence of an active nucleus .",
