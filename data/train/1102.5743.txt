    "weak lensing maps and redshift surveys are fundamental , complementary tools of modern cosmology . a weak lensing map provides a weighted `` picture '' of projected surface mass density ; a redshift survey provides a three - dimensional map of the galaxy distribution resolving structures along the line of sight within the broad window `` imaged '' by the lensing map .    although galaxies are biased tracers of the mass distribution , comparison of a weak lensing map with a foreground redshift survey covering the appropriate range promises progress in resolving some of the issues limiting cosmological applications of weak lensing .",
    "here we focus on the use of weak lensing for identifying clusters of galaxies .",
    "this paper is the second in a series comparing massive clusters identified in a dense foreground redshift survey with significant weak lensing map convergence peaks . in our first paper ( geller et al .",

    "their comparison between clusters identified in the shels redshift survey and the dls weak lensing map agrees with the more pessimistic observational and theoretical assessments of the technique ( e.g. hamana et al 2004 ; hennawi & spergel 2005 ; schirmer et al .",
    "geller et al . ( 2010 ) conclude that only 4 of the 12 significant dls weak lensing peaks with signal - to- noise greater than 3.5 coincide with clusters massive enough to account for the lensing signal .",
    "the shels / dls weak - lensing efficiency for cluster detection is more pessimistic than many previous analyses at least in part because geller et al .",

    "previous studies based on counts or photometric redshifts could not provide a velocity dispersion and often they could not distinguish between a genuine massive cluster and several groups superimposed along the line - of - sight .",

    "further , we chose a weak lensing map and candidate halo list constructed by different observers on a different facility . the subaru weak lensing survey ( miyazaki et al . 2002 ; 2007 )",
    "provides an interesting comparison with the dls because ( 1 ) subaru is an 8.2-meter telescope , ( 2 ) the median seeing for the subaru data was @xmath90.66@xmath8 in contrast with the 0.85@xmath8 seeing for the dls and ( 3 ) the algorithms for constructing the weak lensing map and for identifying significant peaks differ in the two projects .",
