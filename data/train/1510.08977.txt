    "it is thus worth investigating whether the fidelities to large scss can be enhanced with the use of a nondeterministic noiseless amplifier .",
    "we also note that a scheme for deterministic amplification of scss in circuit quantum electrodynamics was proposed @xcite but this scheme can not be applied to free - traveling scss .    in this paper",

    "the noiseless property of the amplification is assessed by the ein of the amplifier @xcite , which is affected by both the state fidelity and the amplitude gain .",
