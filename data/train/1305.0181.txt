    "large - scale magnetic fields with micro gauss strength have been observed in galaxies  @xcite and clusters of galaxies  @xcite .",
    "although it is assumed that such magnetic fields are the result of amplification from weak seed magnetic fields , the origin of the seed magnetic field has not yet been understood .",
    "there are two classes of models for the seed generation mechanism : astrophysical and cosmological models . in astrophysical models ,",
    "the seeds are associated with nonlinear structures , and are generated during structure formation through the biermann battery effect  @xcite , or the weibel instability  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "seeds in the cosmological models are produced in the early universe and exist as extragalactic magnetic fields .",
    "this class of models includes the generation mechanisms in an inflationary epoch , during cosmological phase transitions , and at the epoch of recombination ( for recent reviews , see  @xcite ) .",
    "recent gamma ray observations suggest the existence of cosmological magnetic fields stronger than @xmath0 gauss in the voids  @xcite .",
    "although more detailed work will be required to establish this lower limit  @xcite , the suggestion of such magnetic fields in large - scale structure voids , @xmath1 away from non - linear structures , provides a strong argument in favor of cosmological models . further support in favor of an early universe origin can be obtained if the cosmological galactic magnetic fields are `` helical '' , thus indicating a process of magneto - genesis that fundamentally violates invariance under charge conjugation plus parity reflection ( cp )  @xcite .",
    "magnetic helicity density is defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the vector potential of magnetic fields @xmath4 with @xmath5 .",
    "magnetic helicity is odd under cp transformations as @xmath6 and @xmath4 are odd under c , while @xmath6 is even but @xmath4 is odd under p. non - zero magnetic helicity is predicted in scenarios in which cosmic baryogenesis and magneto - genesis occur concurrently during a cosmological phase transition  @xcite . then the magnetic helicity density is related to the cosmic baryon number density and the cp violation responsible for the excess of matter over antimatter also provides helicity to the magnetic field .",
    "other scenarios that can generate helical magnetic fields that are not tied to baryogenesis have been studied in refs .",
    "helicity is also an important factor in the evolution of magnetic fields because it helps to transfer magnetic field energy from small to large length scales , a process called an `` inverse cascade '' . due to the inverse cascade",
    ", helical magnetic fields can grow to astrophysically relevant scales at the present epoch , even though the initial scale of the magnetic field extends only up to the much smaller cosmological horizon scale at the time of the phase transition .",
    "the two point correlator of a stochastic , homogeneous , isotropic magnetic field contains two independent functions . in physical space , these are the normal and helical correlation functions ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) ; in momentum space , these are the symmetric and antisymmetric power spectra ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) .",
    "there are several tools to measure the normal correlator ( or the symmetric power spectrum ) of cosmological magnetic fields but measuring helicity directly is more challenging .",
    "the detection of helicity of cosmological magnetic fields has been a primary motivation for this work , as few other direct schemes to detect helicity have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "a measurement of the normal correlator itself , together with some theoretical input , provides indirect access to the helicity of the magnetic field .",
    "this is because the presence of helicity influences the evolution of the normal correlator , and the exponents characterizing the normal correlator can give us some information about the magnetic helicity  ( for the evolution in the cosmological context , see  ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the shape of the normal correlator , in particular the existence of a peak in the distribution can also inform us about the epoch of magneto - genesis . if magnetic fields are produced during inflation , the symmetric power spectrum can be expected to be scale invariant with significant power on the present day horizon scale .",
    "direct measures of the helical power spectrum are more difficult . for _ astrophysical _ magnetic helicity , it has been suggested that the correlation between faraday rotation measurement and the polarization degree of radio synchrotron emission  @xcite can be used . for _",
    "cosmological _ magnetic helicity , ref .",
    "@xcite has shown that correlations in the arrival momenta of very high energy cosmic rays are sensitive to the intervening magnetic helicity provided the cosmic ray source locations are known .",
    "cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy observations may also permit a measure of the helicity through non - vanishing cross - correlation between the temperature and b - mode polarization anisotropies and between the e - mode and b - mode polarization anisotropies  @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we propose a scheme to measure both the normal and the helical correlation functions of cosmological magnetic fields by using tev blazar observations . gamma rays with energy greater than @xmath11",
    "can scatter with ambient `` extragalactic background light '' ( ebl ) photons to pair produce electrons and positrons .",
    "the generated electrons and positrons create a secondary cascade of gev gamma rays through the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of cmb photons . as the electron and positron trajectories",
    "are bent due to the lorentz force by a magnetic field , the gev photon cascade carries information about the structure of the cosmological magnetic field . we show that cross - correlations between the arrival directions of the secondary cascade gamma rays at different energies are related to the correlation function of the extragalactic magnetic fields .",
    "if we imagine the cascade photon arrival direction to be a vector in the plane of observation , the inner product of vectors at different energies gives the normal part of the magnetic field correlation , and the outer product gives the helical correlator .    in sec .",
    "[ geometry ] we describe the basic geometry of the process and evaluate the arrival direction of cascade photons as a function of the intervening magnetic field . in sec .",

    "tev gamma rays from distant sources at redshift @xmath13 can not propagate freely over cosmological distances because , at such energies , interaction with the ebl can produce electrons and positrons .",

    "we will assume for simplicity that the redshift of the source is less than one and take @xmath37 .",
    "if there are no magnetic fields in the igm , we will observe cascade gamma rays due to tev gamma rays also in the direction @xmath38 .",
    "however if cosmological magnetic fields are present , the cascade gamma rays arrive from different directions .",
    "we now evaluate the arrival direction assuming a stochastic , homogeneous , and isotropic magnetic field .",

    " see simulations in ref .",
    "@xcite  observed gamma rays with some energy @xmath160 are expected to be scattered around a typical observation direction on the observational plane .",
    "the scattering is due to differences in the magnetic field along the trajectories of different electrons and also the stochasticity of the ebl and cmb photons .",

    "finally we would like to remark that the most likely observation of a tev blazar is when we are positioned at the edge of the jet  @xcite , but we are even more likely to be located outside the jet opening angle",

    "there are few other direct ways to probe the helicity of cosmological magnetic fields and this is an important feature of the technique we have described .    our analysis will need further development as it has used many simplifying assumptions .",
    "for example , the stochastic interactions of the tev photons with the ebl photons will lead to a probability distribution for @xmath29 while we have used a fixed value .",
    "similarly there will be probability distributions for the other interactions , and the magnetic field will have some structure on small scales .",
    "in addition , if the blazar is at high redshift , cosmological expansion will become important .",
    "these effects can best be studied using monte carlo simulations similar to the ones described in refs .",
