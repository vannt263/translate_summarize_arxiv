    "we here review some recent results on analytical solutions of the mikheyev  smirnov  wolfenstein ( msw ) effect @xcite for the propagation of three neutrino flavours .",
    "such analytic results have been obtained for both the exponential density @xcite and the linear density @xcite .    in the case of an exponential electron density , the three neutrino wave functions can be expressed in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions , @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "for the linear density , the solutions can be expressed in terms of a fourier transform @xcite . in the case of two flavours , these reduce to parabolic cylinder functions or confluent hypergeometric functions , but of different parameters and arguments @xcite .    a particular neutrino mass matrix , originally proposed by lehmann , newton and wu ( lnw ) for quarks @xcite is also reviewed @xcite . within this model ,",
    "the current data on atmospheric and solar neutrinos permit a determination of the neutrino masses .",

    "for quarks , it was found @xcite that a particular , simple texture for the @xmath29 ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) quark mass matrices leads to a good description of the ckm matrix @xcite .",

    "this is known as a two - zero texture , but differs from those normally considered ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) in the additional relation between @xmath31 and @xmath33 .",
    "the eigenvalues are given by @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , with @xmath40 .",
    "actually , in the case of quarks , since there is cp violation , a complex ckm matrix is obtained by replacing the parameter @xmath29 in ( [ eq : mass - texture ] ) by @xmath41 for @xmath32 quarks ( such that @xmath42 remains hermitian ) . the ckm matrix becomes @xmath43 the jarlskog determinant @xcite thus obtained is @xmath44 , in good agreement with data .",
    "this same mass matrix has been applied to the case of three neutrinos @xcite , and rather good fits to the atmospheric @xcite and solar @xcite neutrino data have been obtained .",
    "the matrix @xmath42 is diagonalized , whereby @xmath45 . for this purpose ,",
    "the following notation is convenient @xmath46 eliminating @xmath29 and @xmath33 , the resulting cubic equation for the parameter @xmath47 can be written as @xmath48 a physical solution requires @xmath47 real and positive .",
    "this is equivalent to having three real solutions for @xmath47 .",
    "one of these is negative and two are positive . at any point inside the allowed domain in the @xmath49@xmath50 plane ( see fig .  1 ) , there are thus two allowed solutions , denoted solutions  1 and 2 .",
    "this diagonalization has to be carried out for both neutrinos and charged leptons , in order to obtain the neutrino mixing matrix @xcite @xmath51,\\ ] ] where ( @xmath52 or @xmath53 , depending on whether or not there is cp violation ) @xmath54 relates the neutrino mass eigenstates to the flavor states of charged - current interactions : @xmath55    there are four possible solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : cubic - a ] ) , two for the neutrino sector , and two for the charged lepton sector .",
    "furthermore , the model has two signs ( denoted `` parities '' ) to be specified : @xmath31 and @xmath29 can each be either positive or negative ( unless @xmath29 is imaginary @xcite ) .",
    "however , only the product of the `` @xmath31 parities '' in the neutrino and charged lepton sector matters , and similarly for the `` @xmath29 parities '' , so we may put both `` parities '' of the charged lepton sector to @xmath56 .",
    "let us consider first the atmospheric neutrino data .",

    "( [ eq : u - matrix ] ) and ( [ eq : v_ckm_lepton ] ) . in the limit of @xmath61",
    "this simplifies , and invoking further unitarity , one finds @xmath62 which suggests that one needs @xmath63 .",
    "this can be achieved within the model ( for both solutions 1 and 2 ) , for @xmath64 , with also @xmath38 small compared with @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , the data suggest that the scale @xmath39 must be such that @xmath65  ev , or @xmath66",
    ".    fits to atmospheric data confirm this qualitative analysis . invoking also the solar cl @xcite , ga @xcite , super - kamiokande @xcite and sno @xcite neutrino data",
    ", one finds that solution  2 for the neutrino sector , solution  1 for the charged lepton sector and `` @xmath31 parity''=@xmath67 give good fits for @xmath64 , with @xmath38 also small as compared with @xmath39 .",
    "a @xmath68 determined from these different atmospheric and solar survival probabilities leads to good fits ( see fig .",
    "1 ) with @xmath39 about 0.052  ev , @xmath38 about 0.01  ev , and @xmath69 0.0020.004  ev @xcite .",
    "the `` @xmath29 parity '' is unimportant .",
    "[ fig : lvls-052 ]    ( 15.6,6 ) ( -0.5,0.0 )    the effect of the chooz data @xcite is to disfavor the region @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is large . but",
    "this region is already disfavored by the solar neutrino data , as is seen in the middle panel of fig .  1 .",
    "in terms of the more conventional two - flavour analyses for the solar - neutrino sector , these fits roughly correspond to the large - mixing - angle solution .",
    "analytic results for the solutions to the msw equations for three neutrino flavours are very valuable for a fast scanning over the parameters of some given model for the mass matrix .",
    "the lnw mass matrix is a very constrained model that in the quark sector describes the ckm matrix , and in the neutrino sector gives the mixing in terms of the mass eigenvalues .",
    "applied to the neutrino data , the model gives a very good fit .",
    "the solar neutrino data has also been studied within the same model , using numerical integration methods ( no @xmath0 s ) @xcite .",
    "an additional fit was then found at @xmath72  ev , corresponding to the small - mixing - angle solutions .",
    "however , this point is disfavoured by the atmospheric neutrino data , and by the flat electron recoil spectrum @xcite .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the organizers of `` beyond the desert 2002 '' for creating a very stimulating atmosphere .",
    "i should also like to thank r. gastmans , g. vigdel and t. t. wu for very fruitful collaborations .",
