    "coupled spin - oscillators are one of the most fundamental examples of integrable systems ; their dynamical behavior is rich and represents some fairly general properties of low dimensional integrable systems .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study coupled spin - oscillators from the point of view of classical and quantum mechanics , using methods from classical and semiclassical analysis .",
    "a @xmath0-dimensional integrable system with two degrees of freedom consists of a connected symplectic @xmath0-manifold equipped with two almost everywhere linearly independent smooth functions which poisson commute , i.e. two smooth functions on the manifold such that one of them is invariant along the flow of the hamiltonian vector field generated by of the other .",
    "the most interesting geometric and dynamical features of integrable systems are encoded in their singularities , i.e the points where hamiltonian vector fields generated by the functions are linearly dependent . around the regular points , the dynamics is simple , and described by the arnold - liouville - mineur action - angle theorem .",
    "as we will see , the dynamics near the singularities is in general much more complicated and depends heavily on the type of singularity .",
    "let us explain the construction of coupled spin - oscillators more precisely .",
    "let @xmath2 be the unit sphere in @xmath4 with coordinates @xmath5 , and let @xmath6 be equipped with coordinates @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 be positive constants .",
    "let @xmath9 be the product manifold @xmath10 equipped with the product symplectic structure @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath12 be the smooth maps defined by @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "a _ coupled spin - oscillator _ is a @xmath0-dimensional integrable system of the form @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the standard symplectic form on the sphere and @xmath17 is the standard symplectic form on @xmath6 .",
    "the singularities of coupled spin - oscillators are non - degenerate and of elliptic - elliptic , transversally - elliptic ( both of these types are usually referred to as `` elliptic singularities '' ) or focus - focus type .",
    "they have infinitely many transversally - elliptic singularities ( along a piecewise smooth curve , as we shall see ) , one elliptic - elliptic singularity at @xmath18 and one singularity of focus - focus type at @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath20 component of this system is the hamiltonian ( or momentum map ) of the @xmath21-action that simultaneously rotates about the vertical axes of the @xmath1-sphere , and about the origin of @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath22 component is given as follows .",
    "using the natural embedding of @xmath2 in @xmath23 , let @xmath24 be the orthogonal projection from @xmath2 onto @xmath3 viewed as the @xmath25 hyperplane .",
    "let @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    ". under the flow of @xmath20 the points @xmath5 and @xmath28 are moving along the flows of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , with the same angular velocity .",
    "hence the inner product @xmath31 is constant and commutes with @xmath20 .",
    "because @xmath22 does not come from an @xmath21-action , coupled spin - oscillators are not toric integrable systems  they are what now is called _ semitoric integrable systems _ , or simply _",
    "semitoric systems_. semitoric systems form a rich class of integrable systems , commonly found in simple physical models . for simplicity , throughout this paper we assume the rescaling @xmath32 .",
    "the statements and proofs extend immediately to the case of @xmath33 , but we feel that the notation is already sufficiently heavy so we shall avoid carrying these parameters",
    ".      our interest in semitoric integrable systems was motivated by the remarkable convexity results for hamiltonian torus actions by atiyah @xcite , guillemin - sternberg @xcite , and delzant @xcite . despite important contributions by arnold , duistermaat @xcite , eliasson @xcite , v ngoc @xcite , zung @xcite and many others , the singularity theory of integrable systems from the point of view of symplectic geometry is far from being completely understood .",
    "as a matter of fact , very few integrable systems are understood .",
    "the singularities of these systems encode a vast amount of information about the symplectic dynamics and geometry of the system , much of which is not computable with the current methods .",
    "this singularity theory is interesting not only from the point of view of semiclassical analysis and symplectic geometry , but it also shares many common features with the study of singularities in the context of symplectic topology @xcite , algebraic geometry and mirror symmetry ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the coupled spin - oscillator is perhaps the simplest non - compact example of an integrable system of semitoric type .",
    "precisely , a _ semitoric integrable system _ on @xmath9 is an integrable system @xmath34 for which the component @xmath20 is a proper momentum map for a hamiltonian circle action on @xmath9 and the map @xmath35 has only non - degenerate singularities in the sense of williamson @xcite , without real - hyperbolic blocks .",
    "this means that in addition to the well - known elliptic singularities of toric systems , semitoric systems may have _ focus - focus singularities_.    semitoric integrable systems on @xmath0-manifolds have been symplectically classified by the authors in @xcite in terms a collection of five invariants .",
    "while conceptually they are more easily describable , some of these invariants are involved to compute explicitly for a particular integrable system .",
    "the most difficult invariant to compute is the so called taylor series invariant , which classifies a neighborhood of the _ focus - focus singular fiber _ of @xmath36 .",
    "this invariant , which was introduced in @xcite , encodes a large amount of information about the local and semiglobal behavior of the system .",
    "focus - focus singular fibers are singular fibers that contain some fixed point @xmath37 ( i.e. @xmath38 ) which is of _ focus - focus _ type , meaning that there are symplectic coordinates locally near @xmath37 in which @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the coupled spin - oscillator system has non - degenerate singularities of elliptic - elliptic , transversally - elliptic and focus - focus type .",
    "it has exactly one singularity of focus - focus type . near the focus - focus singularity ,",
    "the behavior of the hamiltonian vector fields generated by the system is not @xmath42-periodic , as it occurs with toric systems .        loosely speaking ,",
    "one of the components of the system is indeed @xmath42-periodic , but the other one generates an arbitrary flow which turns indefinitely around the focus - focus singularity and which , as @xmath36 tends to the critical value @xmath43 , deviates from periodic behavior in a logarithmic fashion , up to a certain error term ; this deviation from being logarithmic is a symplectic invariant and can be made explicit ",
    "it is in fact given by an infinite taylor series @xmath44 on two variables @xmath45 with vanishing constant term .",
    "this was proven by the second author in @xcite .",

    "as far as we know , this theorem gives the first rigorous estimate in the literature of the logarithmic deviation , and hence the first explicit quantization of the symplectic dynamics around the singularity ; we prove it in section 2 .",
    "the proof is computational but rather subtle , and it combines a number of theorems from integrable systems and semiclassical analysis .",
    "the method of proof of theorem [ main ] ( given in several steps ) provides a fairly general algorithm to implement in the case of other semitoric integrable systems .",
    "moreover , it seems plausible to expect that the techniques we introduce generalize to compute higher order approximations , but not immediately  indeed , the linear approximation relies on various semiclassical formulas that are not readily available for higher order approximations . in this paper",
    "we will also find the other invariants that characterize the coupled spin - oscillator ( section 3 ) : the polygon and height invariants ; these are easier to find .",

    "finding out how information from quantum completely integrable systems leads to information about classical systems is a fascinating `` inverse '' problem with very few precise results at this time .",
    "section 5 explains how information of the coupled spin - oscillator , including its _ linear _ singularity theory ( computed in section 2 ) , may be recovered from the quantum semiclassical spectrum .    the way in which we recover this linear singularity theory relies on a conjecture for toeplitz operators , which has been proven for pseudodifferential operators .",
    "we explain in detail how to do this and formulate the following conjecture about semitoric integrable systems : that a semitoric system is determined up to symplectic equivalence by its semiclassical joint spectrum , i.e. the set of points in @xmath3 where on the @xmath74-axis we have the eigenvalues of @xmath61 , and on the vertical axis the eigenvalues of @xmath67 restricted to the @xmath63-eigenspace of @xmath61 . from any such spectrum",

    "one can construct explicitly the associated semitoric system .    in this section",
    "we try to convey some ideas to explicitly compute all the symplectic invariants from the semiclassical spectrum",
    ". it might not necessarily be the optimal way to prove an inverse spectral result , as some quantities are more easily defined implicitly rather than explicitly by the spectrum .",
    "but we believe that , from a quantum viewpoint , having constructive formulas for the symplectic invariants is particularly valuable .",
    "we emphasize the word `` semiclassical '' here  : in order to recover the symplectic invariants we need be able to compute the joint spectrum for small values of @xmath482 .",
    "what can be said for a unique , fixed value of @xmath482 is much harder question .",
    "recovering the polygon invariant is probably the easiest and most pictorial procedure , as long as one stays on a heuristic level . making the heuristic rigorous should be possible along the lines of the toric case explained in  @xcite and  @xcite , but we do nt attempt to do it here .      next , in order to recover the polygon invariant , we need to obtain the integral affine structure of the image of the momentum map . we know from  @xcite that the joint spectrum possesses a semiclassical integral affine structure on the regular values of the momentum map .",
    "this integral affine structure can be extended to the elliptic boundaries , as explained in  @xcite .",
    "thus , except along a vertical cut through the focus - focus critical value , one can develop this affine structure such that the joint eigenvalues become elements of the lattice @xmath659 .",
    "see figure  [ fig : recover_polytope ] .    . in the bottom picture ,",
    "we have developed the joint eigenvalues into a regular lattice .",
    "one can easily check on this illustration that the number of eigenvalues in each vertical line in the same in both pictures.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the convex hull of the resulting set is a rational , convex polygonal set , depending on @xmath482 . since the semiclassical affine structure is an @xmath482-deformation of the classical affine structure",
    ", we see that , as @xmath660 , this polygonal set converges to the semitoric polygon invariant .      in order to recover the taylor series invariant from the spectrum ,",
    "we need a precise description of this spectrum .",
    "there are two options  : either describe the spectrum in regular regions , and then take the limit to the focus - focus critical value ; or describe the spectrum directly in a small neighborhood of the focus - focus value .",
    "we choose the second option , because it seems more appropriate for a reasonably accurate numerical formula for the invariants , in the spirit of equation  .",
    "the drawback of this approach is that there is no result currently available giving the description of this spectrum",
    ". the singular bohr - sommerfeld rules of  @xcite would give the required result , in case @xmath61 and @xmath67 were pseudodifferential operators .",
    "of course they are not , since the phase space @xmath661 is not a cotangent bundle .",
    "however they are semiclassical toeplitz operators , in the sense of  @xcite , and it is known that the algebra of toeplitz operators is microlocally equivalent to the algebra of pseudodifferential operators  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we propose the following conjecture .        * @xmath665 admits an asymptotic expansion on integer @xmath666 powers of @xmath482 with smooth ( = @xmath667 ) coefficients in @xmath668 starting with @xmath669 * @xmath670 has an asymptotic expansion on integer @xmath671 powers of @xmath482 with smooth coefficients in @xmath668 starting with the second component of the vector @xmath672 where @xmath83 is the @xmath673 matrix such that @xmath674 .",

    "thus , in view of equation  , we get an explicit formula for the symplectic invariant @xmath321  : @xmath687          we show in this paragraph how the conjecture gives a way to obtain @xmath321 . using formula   above , an easy corollary of the conjecture is theorem 7.6 in @xcite , which says that @xmath691 for @xmath692 . here",
    "@xmath322 is euler s constant .    from the spectrum we can calculate @xmath693 so @xmath694",
