    "to date , 20 extrasolar planets are known with minimum masses ( m  sin  @xmath3 ) less than 10 .",
    "hundreds more planet candidates with sizes smaller than a few earth radii , and therefore potentially terrestrial in nature , have been identified by the _ kepler _",
    "spacecraft @xcite .",
    "it is clear that terrestrial - mass planets exist , but what is not yet clear is the percentage of stars that form such planets , and how often those planets survive post - formation dynamical interactions in order to be observed today .",
    "the frequency of earth - mass planets in the habitable zone , often referred to as @xmath1 , is a key science driver for the _ kepler _ and _ corot _ missions . within this decade",
    ", these space missions are anticipated to provide an estimate of @xmath1 with unparalleled accuracy and precision .",
    "however , the bottleneck for large transit surveys has always been the radial - velocity follow - up to obtain mass estimates for planet candidates .",
    "until the multifarious candidates identified by these spacecraft have mass determinations , radial - velocity surveys capable of 1  precision will make a critical contribution to constraining @xmath1 and the planetary mass function .",
    "this work is prompted by the recent results of @xcite , who presented estimates for the occurrence rate of planets in short periods ( @xmath4 days ) from the nasa - uc eta - earth survey .",
    "our aim is to verify those results by using their methods on our own independent data set .",
    "the anglo - australian planet search ( aaps ) has undertaken two long , continous observing campaigns ( 48 and 47 nights ) with the aim of detecting low - mass planets in periods shorter than 50 days @xcite .",
    "these two `` rocky planet search '' campaigns have targeted a total of 54 bright , stable stars with spectral types between g0 and k5 .",
    "this strategy of observing through a dark lunation facilitates the detection of planets in that period regime by suppressing the window function near one lunar month ( 29 days ) .",
    "previous aaps planet discoveries arising from these observing campaigns include hd  16417b @xcite , 61  vir  b , c , d @xcite , and hd  102365b @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have chosen a subset of the aaps main program stars for observation at high precision by requiring a signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of at least 300 per epoch .",
    "since the aim is a single - epoch radial - velocity precision of 1  ( in the absence of stellar jitter ) , we designate these as `` one meter per second '' ( omps ) stars .",
    "there are 67 omps stars in the aaps target list , of which the 54 rocky planet search targets form a subset .",
    "all of these stars receive at least 20 minutes of integration time per epoch , in order to average over the stellar p - mode oscillations @xcite .",
    "we have previously presented detailed simulations of planet detectability based on data from the 24 stars observed in the first rocky planet search campaign in 2007 : exploring the frequency of planets with periods less than @xmath520 days in @xcite , and investigating the nature of the `` period valley '' in @xcite . in this work",
    ", we consider the entirety of the omps and rocky planet search targets , applying our simulation algorithms to the 67 stars in the aaps sample which have data with the highest velocity precisions .",
    "in particular , we seek to compute the completeness of this sample and to estimate the occurrence rate of low - mass planets with periods @xmath4 days .",
    "we choose this period bin to match the primary focus of @xcite and compare our results with theirs . in section 2",
    ", we present the input data sample and the methods used to obtain detection limits . in section 3 , we compute the completeness of the sample and determine the occurrence rate of planets in four mass bins , before drawing conclusions in section  4 .",
    "in this work , we focus on the 67 `` omps '' stars in the aaps program which have the highest radial - velocity precision . the omps target stars were selected on the basis of being apparently inactive ( log @xmath6 ) and lacking a massive ( i.e.  @xmath710 ) companion , and bright enough to obtain s / n@xmath7300 in no more than 30 minutes of integration time .",
    "this represents essentially all of the aaps target stars down to @xmath8 , with a few additional stars being added between @xmath9 to fill in observing gaps in right ascension .",
    "we fit for and removed velocity trends due to stellar companions , as well as the orbits of known planets .",
    "the data are summarized in table  [ rvdata1 ] , and a histogram of the number of observations is shown in figure  [ datahisto ] .",
    "the parameters of all known planets in this sample are given in table  [ planets ] .",
    "we determined the detectability of planets in these data by adding simulated keplerian signals to the velocity data , then increasing the velocity amplitude ( @xmath10 ) of the artificial planet until 100% of signals at that period were recovered . for a given @xmath10 at a given orbital period @xmath11 , we use a grid of 30 values of periastron passage @xmath12 .",
    "a signal was considered recovered if its period in a standard lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite had a false - alarm probability ( fap ) of less than 0.1% .",
    "trials were also performed at recovery rates ranging from 10% to 90% .",
    "the simulated planets had periods between 2 and 1000 days , with 100 trial periods evenly spaced in log @xmath11 . as in @xcite , the simulated planets had zero eccentricity .",
    "this method is identical to that used in our previous work ( e.g.  wittenmyer et al .",
    "2006 , 2009 , 2010 , 2011 ) .",
    "figure  [ detect ] shows the mass limits ( m  sin  @xmath3 ) averaged over all 67 stars at four recovery rates : 100% , 70% , 40% and 10% .",
    "detected planets in the sample are represented by large filled circles . throughout the discussion on the results of these simulations , we use `` mass '' to refer to the projected planetary mass m  sin  @xmath3 obtained from radial - velocity measurements .",
    "since the inclination of the system is generally unknown , the planetary mass ( m  sin  @xmath3 ) is a minimum value .      the 67 stars considered here host 18 currently known planets orbiting 12 stars .",
    "however , to determine the _ underlying _ frequency of planets in the sample , we need to use the detectabilities we obtain from the simulations to correct these detections for our survey s varying completeness as a function of planet period and planet mass .",
    "moreover , because these detectabilities vary from star to star , we need to make this completeness correction on a star - by - star , rather than on a whole - of - survey basis .",
    "we therefore estimate how many planets have been `` missed '' from our survey as a whole , by calculating the `` missed planet '' contribution for each detected planet using    @xmath13^{-1}-1,\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 is the recovery fraction as a function of mass @xmath15 at period @xmath16 ( for the @xmath3th detected planet ) , and @xmath17 is the total number of stars in the sample ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "there are @xmath3 detected planets in the sample , and @xmath19 stars in total . for a detected planet with period @xmath16 and mass @xmath15",
    ", each star contributes a detectability @xmath20 between 0 and 1 to the sum in equation  ( 1 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath20 is the fraction of simulated planets with period @xmath16 and mass @xmath15 which were recovered . in this way",
    ", we compute the detectability averaged over the whole sample for each detected planet at the specific ( @xmath21 ) of that planet .",
    "this approach , also employed in @xcite , thus accounts for the non - uniformity of detectability across the sample .",
    "we show the results of these calculations in the column labeled `` method  1 '' of table  [ missedplanets ] .",
    "this method for estimating the number of `` missed planets '' ( i.e.  the correction for survey completeness ) is nearly identical to that used by @xcite , except that they defined `` completeness '' as the fraction of _ stars _ for which a planet of mass @xmath22 at period @xmath11 was recovered in 100% of trials .",
    "that is , each star contributes either 0 or 1 to the sum in equation  ( 1 ) .",
    "since that work considered only the 100% recovery level , a star whose detection limit falls just short of the mass for a given planet would be counted as _ never _ able to detect that planet , whereas the true detectability may still be significant ( i.e.  @xmath790% ) .",
    "we have used our simulation results ( at 100% recovery ) to estimate the number of `` missed planets '' using this method , and this is given in table  [ missedplanets ] as `` method  2 . ''",
    "the completeness computations of @xcite excluded stars with detected planets ; our results for method  2 thus excluded the 12 planet hosts , leaving 55 stars .",
    "the last column of table  [ missedplanets ] ( `` method  3 '' ) gives the results obtained using this method when we include the 12 planet - host stars in the calculations .",
    "we see a pronounced difference in the results obtained by methods 1 and 2/3 for the lowest - mass planets : when the completeness is a binary function ( either a planet is detected 100% of the time or it is never detected ) , the number of missed planets is poorly sampled . indeed , this can lead to nonsensical results , e.g.  an infinite number of missed planets .",
    "this unphysical result occurs when considering the detection of planets with properties that match those of the super - earth hd  115617b ( = 61  vir  b ; vogt et al .",
    "2010 ) . at the mass and period of hd  115617b",
    ", none of the data sets for the 55 non - planet - hosting stars in our sample enabled the detection of the simulated planet in 100% of trials .",
    "this resulted in @xmath23 , and hence an infinite number of missed planets by equation  ( 1 ) .",
    "hd  115617 is an unusual target in that we have a large number of observations ( @xmath24 ) and it is a very stable star , with a residual velocity rms ( to the three - planet fit ) of only 2.3 .",
    "this extreme example highlights two important points to consider in the estimation of the frequency of extremely low - mass planets : first , that meaningless results are obtained when the completeness approaches zero , and second , inhomogeneities in planet - search data sets require a detailed , star - by - star approach to best determine the true underlying frequency of low - mass planets .",
    "great caution is therefore required when interpreting results from survey - completeness simulations such as these , especially when considering terrestrial - mass planets , where current radial - velocity surveys are heavily affected by incompleteness .",
    "for the aaps data considered here , the missed - planet correction used by @xcite ( given in table  [ missedplanets ] as method  2 ) , is clearly not useful .",
    "even when planet - hosting stars are included ( method  3 ) , the correction for missed planets gives a result that is unjustifiably overestimated .",
    "this is due to the uneven data density for our sample , as the detection limits achievable depend heavily on the number of observations @xcite .",
    "the aaps sample has a mean @xmath2545 , whereas the keck sample has a mean @xmath2622 .",
    "nonetheless , the high-@xmath27 tail seen in figure  [ datahisto ] reflects a reality for all radial - velocity programs : stars with candidate low - mass planets ( e.g.  61  vir ) are prioritised and receive a larger number of observations .",
    "this directly leads to the situation described above , where a very low - mass planet _ only _ has a high detectability for that one star , and can have detectabilities of , e.g.  only 10% for the remaining targets in the sample .",
    "because the keck sample of @xcite has a somewhat more uniform distribution in @xmath27 , their data are less prone to this feature , and their method is therefore less problematic . it is , however , inappropriate for our data and we adopt method  1 for this work and all subsequent discussion .      to directly compare our results with those of @xcite , we now focus on periods shorter than 50 days .",
    "while @xcite used mass bins of width log@xmath28 , our sample has fewer detected planets , so we use four mass bins of width log@xmath29 .",
    "we estimate the frequency of planets in each bin using binomial statistics , after @xcite .",
    "that is , we compute the binomial probability of detecting exactly @xmath30 planets in a sample of @xmath31 stars , with the underlying probability @xmath32 of hosting a planet .",
    "we compute this over all @xmath32 to find the most probable value ( figure  [ probs ] ) . in this way",
    ", we estimate the planet frequency and its 1-sigma uncertainty ( 68.3% confidence interval ) for each of the four mass bins .",
    "the planet frequencies obtained are then adjusted for incompleteness by multiplying each bin s frequency and its uncertainty by a factor @xmath33 .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ frequency ] .",
    "the uncertainties on our measured planet frequency are large , owing to the small number of detections ( 7 planets with @xmath3450 days ) compared to the keck survey ( 16 planets ) .",
    "as previous studies have shown ( e.g.  howard et al .",
    "2010 , wittenmyer et al .  2010 ,",
    "otoole et al .",
    "2009c ) , planet frequency increases as planet mass decreases ; more low - mass planets are found despite the fact that they are much more difficult to detect .",
    "figure  [ compare ] plots the derived planet frequencies from this work and those of @xcite for direct comparison .",
    "our results are consistent with those of the nasa - uc eta - earth survey : we find that @xmath35% of stars host terrestrial - mass planets ( @xmath36 ) at periods of less than 50 days .",
    "our data are consistent with the estimation of @xcite that 30@xmath3710% of solar - type stars host a planet with m  sin  @xmath3 30  and @xmath4 days .",
    "these results , and those of other radial - velocity planet search teams , support the idea that close - in terrestrial - mass planets ( or `` super - earths '' with @xmath0 ) are quite common in orbital periods less than 50 days .",
    "these observational data are , at present , in disagreement with planet - formation simulations ( e.g.  mordasini et al  2009 , ida & lin 2005 , 2008 , kornet & wolf 2006 ) which predict an under - abundance of such planets orbiting inside of @xmath51  au .",
    "@xcite instead predict a large number of super - earths to accumulate near the ice line , beyond 2  au .",
    "such objects are completely undetectable by current radial - velocity surveys , but the observational data in hand suggest that the planet population synthesis models require significant revision in order to reproduce the high abundance of close - in super - earths for which there is now a growing body of evidence .",
    "the frequency of habitable earth - like planets ( @xmath1 ) is a key quantity to measure as we seek to understand the frequency of habitable environments in the universe .",
    "however , it is important to note that while these results ( and those of howard et al .",
    "2010 ) provide hints on the size of @xmath1 , they do not determine @xmath1 directly . given their orbital periods ( @xmath3450d ) , and therefore semi - major axes ( 0.240.30  au ) , none of the terrestrial - mass planets probed by these studies are actually habitable  they are all far too hot .",
    "a key next step for this research will be extending searches for the lowest - mass planets to larger orbital periods ( and so semi - major axes ) .",
    "if we can at least understand the trends in the frequency with which planet formation makes planets as a function of period , at periods from 50 to 100 and even 150d , then we will be in a much better position to make _ robust _ predictions as to the frequency with which habitable terrestrial planets ( i.e.  planets in 200 - 400d orbits ) are formed around solar - type stars .",
    "low - mass terrestrial planet searches at 100 - 200d must be made an urgent priority for ground - based doppler planet searches in the years ahead @xcite .",
