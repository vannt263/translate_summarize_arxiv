    "regions have long served as a primary indicator of high - mass star formation , both in the milky way and in external galaxies .",
    "the luminosity function of  regions ( lf ) is therefore a vital probe of the present global star formation properties in individual galaxies . in recent years",
    ", the number and accuracy of compiled lfs for nearby galaxies has increased substantially , extending the use of this tool to greater distances .",
    "the differential lf  is usually parameterized as a power law : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the number of nebulae with luminosities in the range @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "some interesting patterns have emerged regarding the form of the lf :    1 .",
    "a large number of galaxies show a break in slope of the lf with the fainter  regions showing a shallower slope compared to the high - luminosity objects ( e.g. ,  kennicutt , edgar , & hodge 1989 , hereafter keh ; rand 1992 ; walterbos & braun 1992 ; rozas , beckman , & knapen 1996a ; ) 2 .",
    "the lf  for arm and interarm regions of spiral galaxies sometimes show steeper slopes in the interarm regions ( e.g. , keh ; banfi etal .",
    "1993 ; rand 1992 ) .",
    "however , there are also many instances where no difference is found ( e.g. , rozas etal .  1996a ; knapen etal .  1993 ; knapen 1997 ) 3 .",
    "the slope of the lf  is correlated with galactic hubble type , such that early - type galaxies show steeper slopes than late - types .",
    "the power - law index @xmath7 for sb  sc galaxies , compared to @xmath8 for sc  i m galaxies ( keh ; banfi etal .",
    "it is even steeper in sa galaxies , with @xmath9 ( caldwell etal .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "these differences in the lf  have usually been interpreted as resulting from corresponding differences in star formation properties .",
    "for example , the break in slope ( point 1 , above ) has been suggested to be caused by a physical transition between normal  regions and the class of supergiant  regions such as 30 doradus in the large magellanic cloud ( keh ) .",
    "likewise , the difference in slope for arm vs. interarm regions , and among various hubble types ( points 2 and 3 ) , have been attributed to differences in gasdynamics and molecular cloud mass spectrum ( e.g. ,  thronson , rubin , and ksir 1991 ; rand 1992 ; keh ) .",
    "however , we feel that it may be premature to draw a direct connection between the form of the lf  and details of star forming environment such as these .",
    "there are other effects that can influence the form of the lf , that have not been adequately explored .    one important effect , in particular ,",
    "is the influence of simple evolution in the ionizing clusters , and hence , luminosity of the host  regions .",
    "there are several empirical factors that suggest that nebular luminosity evolution is an important effect in the form of the lf .",
    "the steeper slopes seen in interarm regions of spiral galaxies ( point 2 , above ) have been identified by von hippel & bothun ( 1990 ) as evidence of an aging effect in those populations .",
    "assuming star formation takes place primarily in the spiral density waves delineated by the arm regions , then the interarm regions should exhibit a typically older population of nebulae in the wake of this star formation activity .",
    "in addition , von hippel & bothun cite the behavior of h@xmath10  equivalent widths as further compelling evidence of the importance of luminosity evolution . as a cluster ages ,",
    "its associated h@xmath10  emission decreases , while that of the underlying red stellar continuum increases , thereby reducing the h@xmath10  equivalent width as a function of time .",
    "they demonstrate that for the  regions in ngc 628 , there is indeed a clear decrease in h@xmath10  equivalent width with decreasing h@xmath10luminosity , indicating higher numbers of evolved nebulae among the fainter populations .",
    "finally , knapen etal .",
    "( 1993 ) and rozas , knapen , & beckman ( 1996b ) show that the slope of the nebular luminosity vs. volume relation is slightly flatter in the interarm regions of five galaxies as compared to the arm regions .",
    "as emphasized by the authors , this may be caused by observational selection effects , but if real , we suggest that it is consistent with a higher tendency for shell - like geometries in the interarm nebulae , as would be expected for an older population .",
    "all of these arguments suggest that evolved nebulae will be an important population in the lf .",
    "von hippel & bothun ( 1990 ) carried out the first detailed investigation of the evolutionary effect on the lf .",
    "they constructed two models to reproduce the observed slope for ngc 628 : one with zero evolution , in which the power - law slope of the luminosity function is due entirely to the cluster mass spectrum ; and one in which the distribution in nebular luminosity is due entirely to a different age and number distribution of objects with the same initial cluster mass .",
    "the lf  resulting from the evolutionary model is sensitive to the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , since the relative numbers of stars at a given ionizing luminosity become important when these stars become the dominant contributor to the nebular luminosity .",
    "recognizing this , von hippel & bothun oriented their study toward exploring the use of the lf  to place constraints on the imf . as a result",
    ", they did not explicitly examine the consequences of aging on the form of the lfitself .",
    "in addition , their assumption of uniform initial cluster masses in the evolutionary model is of only limited use , since actual initial cluster masses apparently have a power - law distribution ( e.g. , oey & clarke 1997 ; see below ) .",
    "therefore , we will here investigate the effect of cluster aging on the form of the lf  itself .",
    "we have carried out a preliminary investigation of this problem as part of a different study ( oey & clarke 1997 ) , and review the important relevant issues here .",
    "a first critical point is the fact that not all clusters have the same relative contribution to ionizing luminosity from the various stellar masses .",
    "such a situation is true for rich clusters that sample the imf well , but breaks down for sparse clusters in which small - number statistics determine the relative ionizing contribution of different stellar masses .",
    "we shall refer to the rich clusters with good stellar statistics as `` saturated '' with respect to the imf , and those with poor statistics as `` unsaturated . ''",
    "the importance of this fundamental difference in the dominant ionizing contributors between the saturated and unsaturated clusters is demonstrated by a break in the predicted slope of the unevolved lf .",
    "this change in slope was clearly demonstrated by mckee & williams ( 1997 ; hereafter mw97 ) , who performed monte carlo simulations of clusters drawn from a truncated power - law distribution in the numbers of member stars @xmath0 , and a scalo ( 1986 ) imf . since @xmath11 for the saturated objects , the lf  slope is the same as the parent slope in @xmath0 ; but for unsaturated populations , the lf  slope is distinctly flatter .",
    "this flattening is caused by the increased scatter in the @xmath5 s contributed by a bin of given @xmath0 .",
    "the unsaturated condition occurs when this scatter is large compared to the mean @xmath5 at the given @xmath0 , hence the slope of the lf  flattens .",
    "mw97 observed that in their simulations , this change in slope occurs at @xmath12 , the luminosity contributed by a single star at the upper - mass limit @xmath13 , of the imf .",
    "stellar models currently suggest that @xmath14 is in the range @xmath15 ( schaerer & de koter 1997 ; vacca , garmany , & shull 1996 ; panagia 1973 ) .",
    "we caution however , that the slope break @xmath16 in the lf  does not necessarily occur at @xmath14 , as we show in  4.3 .",
    "investigation of evolutionary effects on the lf  should therefore consider the differences in stellar ionizing populations between the saturated and unsaturated regime .",
    "we examined the behavior of the saturated case analytically in oey & clarke ( 1997 ) .",
    "we considered two extremes in the formation of ionizing clusters : a single - burst scenario , in which all objects are created at the same time ; and a continuous - creation scenario . in",
    "what follows , we will also assume a constant imf throughout .    for the case of the single burst ,",
    "it is apparent that , since all objects follow the same luminosity evolution , the initial slope of the lf  is simply preserved .",
    "however , in the case of continuous creation , such a conclusion is not obvious .",
    "we described the luminosity evolution of the  regions in terms of a fading function @xmath17 ( oey & clarke 1997 ) : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the zero - age nebular luminosity . stellar population synthesis work ( e.g. ,  leitherer & heckman 1995 ; beltrametti , tenorio - tagle , & yorke 1982 ) suggests that the tail of the fading function @xmath17 is well - described by a power - law in time @xmath20 , so that @xmath21 for saturated objects , the onset time , @xmath22 , for the fading is the same for all objects .",
    "nebular fading causes initially bright objects to contribute to lower-@xmath5 bins at later ages , thus if the epoch of fading dominates over the epoch of zero - age luminosity , we would expect the observed lf  to be steeper than the unevolved one .",
    "we found that for @xmath17 of the form in equation  [ f ] , and reasonable ranges for @xmath13 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , that essentially no change in lf  slope is expected .",
    "there is an exception for initially shallow slopes of @xmath24 , for which the observed slope indeed steepens to a value @xmath25 .",
    "this critical value of the slope is probably in the range 1.2  1.4 , which is lower than most measured lf  slopes , hence it is likely that this effect is unimportant .",
    "these effects are described in further detail in oey & clarke ( 1997 ) .",
    "thus in the saturated regime , no change in lf  slope is reasonably expected .",
    "the statistical uncertainties that dominate the unsaturated clusters render an analytic investigation of these objects unfeasible .",
    "this is due primarily to the fact that many different combinations of stellar masses can contribute to any given luminosity , and there is no simple way to relate the total nebular luminosity to the stellar composition , and hence , luminosity evolution .",
    "we have therefore modeled the lf  with monte carlo simulations to investigate its behavior in the unsaturated regime .",
    "our model draws the integer number of ionizing stars from a power - law distribution , so that @xmath26 is the number of clusters with quantities of stars in the range @xmath0 to @xmath27 : @xmath28 we consider `` clusters '' containing a minimum of one star , with the probability of larger clusters decreasing with @xmath0 according to the exponent @xmath29 .",
    "our models use the ran1 portable random number generator described by press etal .",
    "( 1986 ) , to generate the random deviate @xmath30 , having values between 0 and 1 .",
    "the distribution in @xmath0 given by equation  [ n * ] is then obtained by @xmath31^{1/(1-\\beta)}\\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath0 is assigned to the nearest integer . since the saturated end of the lf  does not change slope ,",
    "as outlined in the previous section , we adopt @xmath32 as a typical value found for lfs in nearby galaxies ( e.g. ,  keh ) . unlike mw97",
    ", we do not consider a distribution that is truncated at an upper limit in @xmath0 for our default models , although this condition is relaxed in   3.3 .    for each cluster",
    ", we then draw @xmath0 stars from a stellar mass distribution truncated above a mass limit @xmath33 : @xmath34      \\ dm \\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the number of stars in the range @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "these are generated with an algorithm analogous to that for @xmath0 .",
    "equation  [ imf ] describes a power - law for @xmath38 , and is the same analytic form used by mw97 for their @xmath0 distribution and imf ; we refer to this form as a truncated power - law , following their nomenclature .",
    "we use a salpeter ( 1955 ) power - law slope of @xmath39 , and adopt an upper - mass limit @xmath40 .",
    "we include stars down to a lower - mass limit @xmath41 ( see below ) .",
    "the h@xmath10  luminosity @xmath42 associated with individual stars is dependent on the mass and main - sequence lifetime @xmath43 , for which we also use power law parameterizations : @xmath44 normalized so that @xmath45 ; and @xmath46 normalized so that @xmath47 myr ( schaerer etal .",
    "1993 ) . for stars in the range @xmath48",
    ", we find a value of @xmath49 from schaerer etal .",
    "we caution the reader that the power - law representations of equations  [ ml ] and [ mti ] are approximations ; the relations steepen significantly toward lower masses . as discussed below , larger values of @xmath50",
    "imply a greater sensitivity of @xmath42 to @xmath36 , thereby increasing the range of @xmath5 in the unsaturated regime , for a given range of @xmath36 .",
    "we adopt @xmath51 , which yields a reasonable @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "for illustrative purposes , it is helpful to show a larger dynamic range of unsaturated objects , though we caution that in reality the range of these objects is likely to be somewhat smaller for our mass limits , since the @xmath54 relation flattens toward higher masses ( e.g. ,  leitherer 1990 ) .",
    "we have adopted the value of @xmath55 to coincide roughly with the value at which the @xmath56 relation turns over more steeply , since stars below @xmath57 do not contribute strongly to the ionizing fluxes .",
    "there is also a relative increase in @xmath58 at lower masses , but not as significant as the change in @xmath59 .",
    "it is useful to bear in mind that the representative values of @xmath50 and @xmath60 will increase toward lower masses .",
    "we consider two different formulations for the stellar ionizing rate @xmath61 with time .",
    "the first simply approximates that @xmath61 remains constant until @xmath43 and is zero thereafter .",
    "the second formulation accounts for evolution of @xmath61 during the stellar main - sequence phase .",
    "figure  [ stellev ] shows @xmath61 for stars of different initial masses as a function of time , from the models of schaerer & de koter ( 1997 ) .",
    "these models suggest that @xmath42 remains fairly constant until a time after which it decreases roughly along the relation , @xmath62 where @xmath63 , and @xmath20 is the age from birth .",
    "given the uncertainties in massive star evolution and ionizing fluxes , we adopt the crude approximation of constant @xmath42 until the time of intersection with equation  [ stelleveq ] , after which we adopt @xmath42 from that relation .",
    "one consequence of this formulation is that stars with initially different luminosities can have the same @xmath42 during certain of their fading periods .",
    "figure  [ stellev ] suggests that this may not be far from reality .",
    "we caution that the assumption of coeval star formation within individual nebulae is likely to be an oversimplification , and that the stellar age spread is typically similar to the main - sequence lifetime of the most massive stars ( e.g. ,  massey etal .",
    "therefore , the early nebular luminosity evolution could potentially increase somewhat before the onset of fading .",
    "specific modeling of star formation scenarios would be necessary to investigate this effect .",
    "our adopted lower - mass cutoff introduces artificial fluctuations that can be seen in all our models at low @xmath5 .",
    "the quantized nature of the stellar ionizing sources , combined with the truncation of stellar masses below @xmath55 , causes artificial kinks in the distribution of nebular luminosities at low @xmath5 .",
    "for example , the most prominent of these features appears at @xmath64 in our models , or 0.3 dex above the lower-@xmath5 cutoff of @xmath65 .",
    "this dip results from the fact that all nebulae at @xmath66 contain single stars , selected according to the imf , whereas two - star nebulae begin to contribute above this luminosity .",
    "to more clearly demonstrate the features in the lf , we therefore include @xmath67 clusters in our simulations , although this number is higher than is seen in most nearby galaxies .",
    "finally , we truncate our model lfs below the minimum luminosity @xmath68 , which is that due to a single star of mass @xmath55 .",
    "although objects originating at higher @xmath5 evolve to luminosities below @xmath69 for cases incorporating main - sequence evolution , the omission of objects originating below @xmath68 renders the model populations incomplete below that value .",
    "figure  [ unsat ] shows two models for the evolution of an region population created in a single burst , with @xmath70 , @xmath49 , and @xmath71 .",
    "the left column of figure  [ unsat ] ( panels @xmath72 ) shows model a1 , with constant @xmath42 during the main - sequence ; while the right column ( panels @xmath73 ) shows model a2 , with @xmath74 as described above , to include main - sequence fading .",
    "the zero - age lfs are given in the top panels , with the middle and bottom panels showing ages of 4 and 7 myr , respectively .",
    "note that the two zero - age models ( top panels ) are statistically identical .",
    "to aid comparison of the models , the dotted line corresponding to @xmath75 is shown for reference .    as found in the simulations of mw97 ,",
    "the zero - age models in figure  [ unsat ] ( top panels ) show a flattening of the lf  slope below a saturation luminosity . for the adopted stellar parameters , this transition from saturated to unsaturated populations occurs at @xmath76 .",
    "equation  [ ml ] shows that the extent of this unsaturated regime is determined by @xmath50 : a larger @xmath50 implies a greater sensitivity of @xmath42 to @xmath36 , thereby increasing the range in @xmath5 of this population , for a given range of @xmath36 .",
    "this effect also causes the slope in the unsaturated regime ( @xmath77 ) to be dependent on @xmath50 because the scatter in @xmath5 contributed by individual stars is larger for large @xmath50 , and this scatter determines the flattening in slope .",
    "hence , larger values of @xmath50 will induce a flatter slope . as mentioned above",
    ", our adopted value of @xmath78 is an overestimate for the more massive stars in the imf , hence the unsaturated slope should be somewhat steeper near @xmath16 than is seen in our models .",
    "regions with @xmath79 are not sensitive to the @xmath54 relation since statistical effects are unimportant in this regime .",
    "the slope of the lf  in the saturated regime is @xmath29 , the same as that of the parent distribution in @xmath0 ( equation  [ n * ] ) , as described in  2 .",
    "figures  [ unsat]@xmath80 and @xmath81 show model a1 at ages of 4 and 7 myr respectively . these ages should not be regarded too literally , since the evolutionary state at a given age is dependent on equation  [ mti ] , which is an approximate parameterization , as well as equations  [ imf ] and [ ml ] . for reference , @xmath82 myr for our adopted @xmath49 .",
    "it is immediately apparent that the inflection in slope moves toward progressively lower luminosities with age .",
    "this is primarily a reflection of the group evolution of the saturated population to lower luminosities ; the entire distribution at @xmath83 in figure  [ unsat]@xmath84 is moving toward lower luminosities in figures  [ unsat]@xmath80 and @xmath81 . for cases such as this , in which the zero - age @xmath12 , the slope inflection at later ages now corresponds to @xmath42 of the most massive star still present in these objects . more generally , the rate at which the saturated objects fade in @xmath5 has a dependence of @xmath85 , as determined by equations  [ ml ] and [ mti ] .",
    "model a2 includes main - sequence evolution of the ionizing fluxes .",
    "we caution that the models including the main - sequence evolution should be interpreted qualitatively , owing to the crude parameterization of the stellar evolution .",
    "the principal feature is that model a2 clearly evolves much faster than model a1 .",
    "the other important effect is that noticeable , sharp structure in the lf  becomes apparent near the transition from saturated to unsaturated objects , as seen in figure  [ unsat]@xmath86 as contrasted to figure  [ unsat]@xmath80 . this results from the fact that clusters dominated by a few , high - mass stars are now capable of evolving to lower @xmath5 than clusters dominated by many , unevolved , low - mass stars . in other words ,",
    "stellar evolution allows the low-@xmath5 end of the saturated population to overtake , toward lower luminosities , the high-@xmath5 end of the unsaturated population .",
    "the details of this structure in the lf  are dependent on the details of the main - sequence luminosity evolution .",
    "figure  [ unsatcc ] shows simulations for a population where the  regions are being continuously created ( model b1 ) .",
    "this model is the same as that in the single burst case with no main - sequence luminosity evolution ( model a1 ) , but now with each new cluster formed at a uniform incremental time after its predecessor .",
    "the total distribution of initial luminosities , @xmath87 , of all the objects , which represents the parent , unevolved lf , is the same as the zero - age distributions in models  a1 and a2 ( figures  [ unsat]@xmath84 and @xmath60 ) . figure  [ unsatcc]@xmath84 shows the distribution at an age of 6 myr after the onset of continuous creation , but before the population has achieved its steady - state form .",
    "the steady - state lf , which occurs at @xmath88 , is shown in the figure  [ unsatcc]@xmath80 .",
    "we may consider the lf  for continous creation to be a sum of individual bursts with a continuous age distribution .",
    "since the single burst lf  evolves predominantly as a progression of the saturated objects , with slope @xmath29 , to the lower luminosities of the unsaturated regime , we therefore expect that the slope in the region @xmath89 will be intermediate between its flatter value in the unevolved case and @xmath29 .",
    "figure  [ unsatcc]@xmath80 shows that this is indeed the case .",
    "we can also see in figure  [ unsatcc]@xmath84 , that the intermediate evolutionary stage shows the region of steepening moving in from higher luminosities , since the low - luminosity bins are not yet affected by saturated , evolved objects .",
    "we also generated a model b2 , incorporating main sequence luminosity evolution , analogous to model a2 .",
    "the steady - state form of that model also shows an intermediate - value slope at @xmath90 , but slightly flatter than its analog in model b1 because of the structure present at @xmath89 in the burst case ( model a2 ) .      in figure  [ unsatonly ] , we show models for a population of only unsaturated clusters .",
    "these are drawn from the same power law distribution in @xmath0 ( equation  [",
    "n * ] ) as the previous models , but only for @xmath91 . for our default stellar parameters with @xmath71 ,",
    "the saturation transition in @xmath0 is roughly between 10 and 20 stars .",
    "we use the same stellar parameters as in the previous models , now with a total of 3000 clusters .",
    "the left side of figure  [ unsatonly ] shows the simulation for the unevolved population ( @xmath84 ) , and continuous creation ( @xmath80 ) ; while the right side shows the single burst case at ages 4 myr ( @xmath81 ) and 7 myr ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "these models do not include main sequence luminosity evolution , whose consequences are analogous to those discussed for models a2 and b2 above .",
    "it is apparent in figure  [ unsatonly ] that the primary difference in the lf  between this population and the complete power - law sampling in @xmath0 , is that the high-@xmath5 tail of the unsaturated objects falls off very steeply .",
    "the highest - luminosity , unsaturated clusters result from a chance assemblage containing a disproportionate number of high - mass stars .",
    "therefore , the distribution of these objects must fall more steeply than that of a saturated population , owing largely to the scarcity of the high - mass stars . the actual slope in this regime",
    "is once again determined by the detailed statistics of the cluster compositions , and equations  [ imf ] and [ ml ] .    at @xmath89 ,",
    "the behavior of these unsaturated populations is identical to that seen in the models with a full distribution in @xmath0 , since , as discussed above , this range in @xmath5 is dominated by the unsaturated objects .",
    "it is only at the high-@xmath5 limit itself , in the evolved case of figure  [ unsatonly]@xmath60 , that the sudden drop due to sheer lack of objects , effectively generates a steep slope .",
    "note that at luminosities below this high-@xmath5 drop - off , the lfin this model recovers a slope of @xmath29 , analogous to figure  [ unsat]@xmath81 .",
    "the features and behavior found in the simulated lfs can provide a useful interpretation of the patterns found in observed lfs .      in figure  [ arms ] , we reproduce the published lfs for arm and interarm populations in six grand design spirals .",
    "the solid histograms show the arm lfs , and the dot - dashed lines show the interarm lfs . in each case",
    ", the peak of the interarm lf  occurs at a fainter luminosity than that for the arm regions , suggesting that the interarm lf  mirrors that of the arms at lower @xmath5 .",
    "this shift in peak occurs despite the smaller total numbers of  regions in the interarm areas .",
    "owing to incompleteness effects , we might otherwise expect the smaller numbers to induce a turnover at , if anything , higher @xmath5 .",
    "we do caution that blending of nebulae ( deharveng et al .",
    "1988 ; keh ) in the more crowded arm populations could also introduce a flattening in the observed lf  at lower @xmath5 . however , as pointed out previously ( rand 1992 ; knapen etal .",
    "1993 ; keh ) , the highest-@xmath5 objects in the interarm regions are apparently always fainter than those in the arms .",
    "this is again consistent with a group shift in luminosity .",
    "these features exhibit the behavior of our model lfs for the burst scenario .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that the arm nebulae are largely coeval , and are undergoing a current burst of cluster formation ; whereas the interarm regions represent , on average , an older population remaining from previous star formation .",
    "as seen in figure  [ unsat ] , the inflection in the lf  occurs at progressively lower values with age .",
    "note that even if incompleteness affects the location of the peak for the arm objects , which we take to reflect the unevolved population , the relative shift in the peak for the interarm objects is still consistent with evolution , owing to the steeper slope at lower @xmath5 .",
    "this is because the low-@xmath5 bins are more robust to incompleteness for a steep slope than for a shallow one , since the proportion of missing objects is the same in each case .",
    "therefore , while the absolute location , or existence , of the lf  peak may be suspect due to observational limitations , the observed shift in peak for the interarm regions is fully consistent with our model because a steeper slope is expected at low @xmath5 ( cf .",
    "figure  [ unsat]@xmath60 and @xmath92 ) .",
    "indeed , given that the lf  peak is often substantially lower in @xmath93 for the interarm regions , this suggests that the actual peak of the distribution has moved to luminosities much lower than the empirical completeness limit , as is illustrated , for example , in figure  [ unsat]@xmath92 .",
    "the aging effect can also explain the steeper lf  slopes that are sometimes reported for the interarm regions as compared to the arm regions of spiral galaxies ( point  2 in  1 ) .",
    "if the actual nebular luminosity function conforms to the two - slope shape seen in the models , and if the two slopes are not fitted separately , then the net effect is that the measured slope will be intermediate between the two . in our single burst model ,",
    "the location of the break moves to lower @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , over a fixed range of @xmath5 , the contribution of the shallower slope to the composite , measured lf  slope will be less for an evolved burst population , than for an unevolved one . as is apparent in figure  [ arms ] , it is difficult to pinpoint the location of the slope change .",
    "we mention once again that our simulations show a flatter slope in the unsaturated regime than would be expected , owing to the parameterization of equation  [ ml ] .",
    "furthermore , the observed location of @xmath16 will also vary with galactic internal extinction , which most lfs , including the ones in figure  [ arms ] , do not take into account . with these difficulties , we suggest that the slopes of the interarm regions do appear to be the same as those in the saturated regime of the arm populations .",
    "thus the differences observed in the lfs for arm and interarm regions are not necessarily due to changes in star formation environment , but are likely to be affected by evolution .",
    "the time scale between the passage of spiral density waves is of order @xmath94 myr ( e.g. ,  rand 1993 ) at any given location in the disk , which is much longer than the observable life expectancy of the  regions .",
    "thus , the spatial and luminosity distribution of nebulae between the arms does imply that there is at least a certain amount of bona fide interarm star formation taking place .",
    "however , based on the arguments presented in  1 , we feel that an aging population is likely to be an important component in the interarm regions , and that the behavior of the lf  is consistent with this interpretation . with the present data and the observational uncertainties mentioned above , combined with uncertainties in predicted @xmath61 and its evolution , we have not attempted to place meaningful age constraints on the evolved population . however , it will be interesting to re - examine the data more closely , and search for an evolutionary progression in the lf  with distance behind the leading edge of the spiral arms .",
    "we hope to carry out such an investigation in the near future .",
    "the correlation of earlier type galaxies with steeper slopes ( point 3 in  1 ) can be explained by systematically lower cutoffs in @xmath0 in those clusters .",
    "keh have shown compelling evidence that these galaxies have fewer stars per cluster , since the mean nebular luminosities in the early type spirals are substantially lower than those in late types , despite the larger total numbers of  regions in the earlier types . therefore , unless the stellar ionizing population varies drastically , it is probable that the size of the parent clusters must themselves be smaller on average in the earlier type galaxies . the same conclusion has been found for sa galaxies ( caldwell etal .",
    "1991 ) , although the total numbers of regions are again smaller in those galaxies .",
    "the decrease in typical @xmath0 per cluster with hubble type ( keh ) could easily result from a decrease in the upper cutoff of the @xmath0 power - law .",
    "the earliest type galaxies would have populations composed only of unsaturated objects , as would correspond to sa galaxies , where the maximum @xmath95 is typically in the range @xmath96 ( caldwell etal .",
    "this is the same range in values as the estimates for @xmath14 , as mentioned earlier , hence it is indeed the regime of unsaturated objects . as seen in  3.3 , the models that describe this population show a steeper high - luminosity tail above @xmath16 , than do the populations with saturated objects .",
    "indeed , the slopes in sa galaxies have been found to be even steeper than those for sb  sc types : the typical lf  slope @xmath97 for sa galaxies ( caldwell etal .",
    "1991 ) , as compared to @xmath98 for sb  sc galaxies ( keh ; banfi etal .",
    "the model in figure  [ unsatonly]@xmath80 , for continuous creation of unsaturated objects , would therefore be the most appropriate of our simulations to describe the sa lfs . the form of the sa lfs shown in figure  5 of caldwell etal .",
    "( 1991 ) show a consistent resemblance with our models in figure  [ unsatonly ] .",
    "thus , ironically , although these nebulae are dominated by unsaturated objects whose characteristic slope is flatter than the saturated case , the high-@xmath5 drop - off will induce a steeper measured slope in these populations .",
    "the sb  sc galaxies would then show a slope intermediate between the sa and i m types ( cf .",
    "figures  4@xmath80 and 3@xmath80 ) , as the upper cutoff in @xmath0 approaches the exclusively unsaturated regime .",
    "indeed , keh suggest that the lf  in sb  sc galaxies is truncated at an upper-@xmath5 limit . this is quantitatively supported by mw97 , who also find evidence for a truncated lf  in the milky way and sb  sc galaxies , but not in irregular galaxies .",
    "since this limit is still at @xmath5 above the regime of unsaturated objects , these findings are consistent with our interpretation of a progressively lower upper-@xmath0 cutoff with earlier hubble type",
    ". there may be exceptions caused by temporarily enhanced star formation , in which large numbers of saturated clusters are formed .",
    "this scenario can explain the larger range in lf  slope seen in earlier type galaxies ( keh ) .",
    "indeed , a slope steepening at high @xmath5 reported in some earlier type galaxies could well correspond to a cutoff ; indeed , keh note that it is often impossible to distinguish such a turnover from a cutoff .",
    "thus the steepening in slope for disk galaxies across the hubble sequence can be explained by a simple trend in upper cutoff of the @xmath0 distribution , and need not invoke a change in the parent slope @xmath29 of @xmath0 .      in  3 , we denoted the luminosity of the slope break in the initial lf  by @xmath16 and noted that , as in the models of mw97 , this often corresponds to the luminosity contributed by most luminous star in the imf , @xmath14 .",
    "we however caution that this correspondence is dependent on the stellar parameters . as an example",
    ", figure  [ trans ] exhibits the lf  resulting from two models with identical imf slope and @xmath99 relation , but with different stellar mass limits .",
    "figure  [ trans]@xmath84 , with @xmath100 , exhibits an lfthat more closely resembles in form the simulation by mw97 .",
    "there are two principal slope breaks apparent : one near @xmath14 ; and one near @xmath101 , below which the slope appears quite flat .",
    "the existence of a minimum cluster membership number , @xmath102 , causes this flattening , or in some cases even positive slope , for luminosities below the expectation value of @xmath5 containing single stars , i.e. , the average stellar luminosity @xmath101 . at @xmath103 ,",
    "there is an intermediate slope in the lf  that joins the flat regime to the saturated regime of slope @xmath29 .",
    "a small transition region of @xmath104 dex is noticeable in this intermediate - slope region near both @xmath101 and @xmath14 , which results from the form of the imf adopted in equation  [ imf ] . with instead a sharp imf truncation at @xmath33",
    ", the slope breaks would occur cleanly at @xmath101 and @xmath14 .",
    "one can now see that certain stellar mass ranges and values of @xmath50 can change the relative location of the two breaks such that one or the other could disappear .",
    "the model in figure  [ trans]@xmath80 , with @xmath105 , shows an example where the @xmath14 slope break is virtually undetectable at @xmath106 . the smaller difference between @xmath101 and @xmath107 has compressed the intermediate - slope range in @xmath5-space , thereby steepening its slope to a value closer to @xmath29 , which represents the maximum slope possible in this regime .",
    "an observed lf  similar to figure  [ trans]@xmath80 would most likely be measured to have only one slope in the regime @xmath108 .",
    "note that the models in figure  [ trans ] are probably unrealistic , since @xmath78 is not representative over such large mass ranges , and we only show these for illustrative purposes .",
    "however , these examples demonstrate that breaks in observed lfs should be interpreted with caution , and may only provide a lower limit to the most luminous star in the imf .",
    "furthermore , the tendency of the highest - mass stars to approach similar ionizing emission rates @xmath61 ( e.g. ,  leitherer 1990 ) , compounds the insensitivity of @xmath14 to @xmath33 .",
    "we therefore conclude that , unfortunately , the lf  is not a useful probe of @xmath33 .",
    "however , the insensitivity of @xmath14 to @xmath33 suggests that the high-@xmath5 end of the lf  should be a reliable indicator of @xmath29 for saturated nebular populations , since it diminishes the likelihood of a varying @xmath33 as an explanation for the observed variations in the lf .",
    "the principal caveat is that a truncation at maximum @xmath0 not be confused with a steep slope of @xmath29 , as may have been done for sa galaxies in the past ( see above ) .",
    "it is also apparent that , since the form of the lf  is sensitive to the stellar parameters , that demonstrable variations in the unsaturated regime of the zero - age or continuous creation lf   could possibly indicate substantial variations in the stellar parameters of the hottest stars .",
    "we note that stochastic variations in @xmath33 within a galaxy will not change the location of the break if the distribution of @xmath33 is gaussian .",
    "we confirmed this by drawing @xmath33 from a parent normal distribution of @xmath109 and the same mean value of 100@xmath110 .",
    "the resulting lf  is indistinguishable from that with a constant @xmath33 .",
    "empirically , a flattening at lower @xmath5 is often seen in many galaxies ( point 1 in  1 ) , but at varying critical luminosities . while the models for a single burst show that the transition point is not necessarily fixed , @xmath16 can not be greater than @xmath111 at present , the value of @xmath14 , the h@xmath10  luminosity associated with @xmath33 , is not well - determined .",
    "our models have adopted a value of @xmath112 , which is uncertain within a factor of a few , and is a high estimate .",
    "most published lfs are not corrected for internal extinction within the galaxies , which will affect the location of the break . as can be seen in figure  8@xmath80 of walterbos & braun ( 1992 ) , extinction correction for the highly - inclined case of m31 can shift the location of the apparent turnover by an order of magnitude .",
    "it is also important to distinguish between a real slope change and artificial slope flattening induced by limitations such as incompleteness , and the more insidious problem of object blending , mentioned above , for more distant galaxies . in view of the difficulty in pinpointing the location of a slope change , and the variations induced by reddening and possible aging effects",
    ", we suggest that the published lf  slopes are thus far consistent with our models .",
    "we note that keh modeled the lower-@xmath5 end of the lf  by combining the @xmath54 relation with the imf for single - star  regions .",
    "this representation is somewhat different from ours , since we include multiple - star , low-@xmath5 objects that will contribute to the same luminosity bins occupied by bright , single - star nebulae .",
    "our slope in this regime will therefore tend to be slightly flatter ( more positive ) than theirs .",
    "this will affect estimates for the fraction of total galactic ionizing emission due to faint regions below empirical completeness limits , such that those using the keh model are an upper limit for similar stellar parameters .",
    "additional models of the lf  by feinstein ( 1997 ) came to our attention during the refereeing process .",
    "these models consider only nebular populations with luminosities scaled from objects with a saturated imf , but with @xmath55 extending down to @xmath113 .",
    "we emphasize that , since unsaturated clusters are not considered , the slope turnover seen in those models is therefore _ not _ caused by the same mechanism seen in our work , or that of keh and mw97 .",
    "rather , the slope break seen in feinstein s models result from the adopted lower cutoff in the @xmath5 distribution , combined with an extended creation period .",
    "the zero - age , saturated lf  is described by the power - law @xmath29 , which simply shifts to lower luminosity with advancing age , as exhibited by the saturated tail of our models in figure  [ unsat ] .",
    "feinstein s continuous creation models are therefore a superposition of many power - laws with a continuous range of ages .",
    "the lower-@xmath5 cutoff seen in those models therefore induces a flattening in the lf  below that luminosity .",
    "this is best illustrated in the right panel of feinstein s figure  3 , which varies the lower-@xmath5 cutoff according to assumed total stellar mass , for continuous creation .",
    "the slope break occurs at the lower-@xmath5 cutoff , hence , as pointed out by the author , this parameter determines the location of the break .",
    "we caution , however , that the lower-@xmath5 cutoffs used in feinstein s models are necessarily artificial , owing to the consideration of only saturated  regions .",
    "therefore , the slope breaks seen in these models must be regarded as artificial to the same extent . if , however , nebular creation scenarios exist with such a strong lower-@xmath5 cutoff , feinstein s models demonstrate another mechanism which can also induce a slope break .",
    "previous work has sometimes suggested an empirical slope change at high luminosities of @xmath114 or even higher ( rozas etal .",
    "1996a ; rand 1992 ; keh ) .",
    "if a break at these high luminosities is real , it is unlikely to result from the stochastic effect below @xmath16 .",
    "however , if the high-@xmath5 slope is steep enough , it could well be a manifestation of the maximum @xmath0 cutoff in those galaxies , which is expected to vary in the scenario we presented in  4.2 .",
    "it could also result from a change in @xmath16 , although this appears unlikely , as argued above . but factors other than those that we have considered can affect the form of the lf  as well .",
    "for example , rozas etal .",
    "( 1996a , b ) suggest that such a break at high @xmath5 results from a transition between radiation - bounded nebulae at fainter luminosities , to density - bounded objects at brighter luminosities .",
    "another potentially important effect is a differential extinction pattern among the nebular population , and of course , the usual differences in imf slope and star forming conditions .",
    "given the currently available data , the systematic presence of an additional , high - luminosity slope change at a fixed @xmath5 remains controversial .",
    "we have modeled the lf  with monte carlo simulations that draw @xmath0 for each cluster from a power - law distribution of constant slope , and for each cluster , @xmath36 from a salpeter imf truncated at @xmath115 . as found by mw97 ,",
    "this produces shallower slopes corresponding to the population dominated by unsaturated objects , and a steeper , high-@xmath5 side dominated by saturated ones .",
    "the saturated slope is @xmath29 , the slope of the @xmath0 distribution ( equation  [ n * ] ) .",
    "the transition luminosity @xmath16 in the unevolved lf  may correspond to @xmath14 , the h@xmath10  luminosity due to a single star of mass @xmath33 , but this depends on the assumed stellar parameters .",
    "the observed lfs do often show flatter slopes at lower luminosities that are consistent with the transition at @xmath16 ( e.g. ,  walterbos & braun 1992 ; scowen , dufour , & hester 1992 ) .",
    "we have hitherto not discussed the form of the lf  below @xmath69 , which is unexplored in our models .",
    "since the slope @xmath50 of the @xmath54 relation ( equation  [ ml ] ) steepens , the lf  will continue to grow flatter for the same @xmath0 power law , extending to lower luminosities . at @xmath116 ,",
    "contamination from planetary nebulae may become important ( walterbos & braun 1992 ) , while confusion and background diffuse h@xmath10  emission will undoubtedly limit the lf  in this regime .",
    "our simulations show that for a single - burst case , the slope transition moves to lower @xmath5 as the population ages and the saturated objects grow fainter ( figure  [ unsat ] ) .",
    "hence , the steady - state model for continuous creation shows a slope in the region @xmath89 that is intermediate between its value in the unevolved lf  and the slope @xmath29 of the saturated objects ( figure  [ unsatcc ] ) .",
    "models that include main - sequence evolution for stellar ionizing luminosities show a faster evolution than those that do not , with a noticeable peak around the transition between saturated and unsaturated populations ( figure  [ unsat]@xmath86 ) .",
    "the steady - state model for continuous creation incorporating stellar evolution yields a slightly shallower slope than that for the case without stellar evolution , but still steeper than the unevolved case .",
    "models for a population of only unsaturated clusters with @xmath117 show a much steeper drop - off at @xmath118 ( figure  [ unsatonly ] ) , where the lf  is normally dominated by saturated objects .",
    "the behavior at @xmath89 is generally the same as that for the models with fully populated @xmath0 , with the exception of a high-@xmath5 drop - off in an evolving burst .",
    "the patterns seen in observed lfs in nearby galaxies can be explained by the behavior of these models .",
    "if  regions in spiral arms of galaxies represent a current burst of coeval star formation , then the steeper slopes seen in interarm vs. arm regions can be explained as an aging burst compared to a current burst population . since single slope measurements",
    "will yield a composite of the saturated and unsaturated slopes , the zero - age lf  will show a flatter slope owing to the larger range of unsaturated objects .",
    "the lower peak @xmath5 and maximum @xmath5 seen in the interarm regions are also consistent with a dominant contribution from an aging population .    the steeper slopes seen in earlier galactic hubble types can be explained by the lower cutoff in maximum @xmath0 . as seen in the models for populations of only unsaturated clusters ( figure  [ unsatonly ] ) , the high-@xmath5 tail is much steeper than in populations with higher @xmath0 .",
    "a truncation at the high end of the lf  has been suggested by keh and mw97 .",
    "since the mean @xmath0 does apparently decrease in earlier type galaxies to the values in unsaturated clusters ( keh ; caldwell etal .",
    "1991 ) , the steeper lf  slopes are likely to simply result from a lower maximum @xmath0 .",
    "a slope dropoff therefore may also be seen at @xmath5 corresponding to the maximum @xmath0 .",
    "thus , we suggest that the current data are consistent with evolutionary effects and the upper-@xmath0 cutoff being the primary determinants of the shape of the lf",
    ". indeed , it may be unnecessary to invoke any other parameters for the nebular and cluster properties to explain the behavior of the lf  as described in  1 .",
    "if this is true , it is rather remarkable , for example , that grand design spirals with strong star formation induced by tidal interactions , would show the same power - law distribution in @xmath0 as those found in normal disk and irregular galaxies .",
    "however , we again acknowledge that other , unexplored effects , such as gas density bounding , differential reddening , and variations in imf and other stellar parameters , can influence the form of the lf . nor can we rule out suggested environmental influence like variations in slope of the molecular cloud mass spectrum .",
    "but thus far , it appears that the power - law slope @xmath29 of @xmath0 might vary even less than was suggested by the observed slopes of the lf , even though the rate and total star formation can vary by one to two orders of magnitude .",
    "further detailed observations of the lf , and re - examination of those in the literature , are of great interest in evaluating the possibility of a universal @xmath119 .",
    "suggestively , caldwell etal .",
    "( 1991 ) find that the luminosity function of knots seen in the @xmath120 continuum of four of their sa galaxies do show such a power - law exponent @xmath121 .    as is done with the luminosity functions of distant galaxies",
    ", it may thus be possible to use the form of the lf  to understand features in the most recent star formation history ( @xmath2 myr ) of their host galaxies , since individual bursts can leave their imprint on the lf .",
    "our models , for example , show that an aged burst population is distinguishable from continuous creation of low-@xmath0 clusters ( cf",
    ". figures  [ unsat]@xmath81,@xmath92 and [ unsatonly]@xmath80 ) .",
    "feinstein ( 1997 ) also demonstrates effects of different creation histories . at present , it is difficult to make useful quantitative constraints , owing to present constraints on stellar and cluster parameters , but it is at least possible gain qualitative insight on the recent star formation history .    we thank rob kennicutt , johan knapen , and the referee , carlos feinstein , for comments on the manuscript .",
