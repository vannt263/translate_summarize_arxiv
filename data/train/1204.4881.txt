    "in the past fifteen years , our understanding of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) had been revolutionized . as usual ,",
    "some aspects are understood better than others .",
    "for example , the detection of a bright supernova component in the afterglow of some nearby long grbs establishes their collapsar origin and the late ( @xmath8 s after the trigger of the burst ) afterglow data support the external forward shock model ( piran 2004 ; zhang & mszros 2004 ) . yet",
    "the physical origin of the prompt emission of grbs is still not clear .",
    "the  leading \" internal shock model is found hard to explain some observational facts , motivating people to develop the internal magnetic energy dissipation models and the photosphere models ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * for reviews ) .",
    "it is rather hard to distinguish among these models reliably .",
    "it is widely speculated that the polarimetry of the prompt emission , for example , by polarimeters for energetic transients ( poet , hill et al .",
    "2008 ) and by polar ( orsi 2011 ) , may play key roles in the future . in this letter",
    "we show that some empirical correlations of the prompt emission properties may have shed valuable light on the underlying physics and the photospheric model is favored .",
    "the tight correlation @xmath9 was discovered by wei & gao ( 2003 , see fig.6 therein ) and then has been confirmed by many researches ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , a tight correlation @xmath10 was identified by @xcite and a correlation @xmath11 was suggested by @xcite .",
    "very recently , @xcite and @xcite discovered a tight correlation @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the isotropic - equivalent energy of the prompt emission and @xmath14 is the total energy of the afterglow emission in x - ray band . in the forward shock afterglow model , @xmath14 is proportional to @xmath15 , the kinetic energy of the outflow @xcite .",
    "therefore @xmath16 is proportional to the grb efficiency @xmath17 as long as @xmath18 is considerably smaller than @xmath15 .",
    "hence one has @xmath19 .",
    "some possible interpretations of the @xmath0 correlation can be found in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this letter",
    "we aim to interpret all the above four correlations together .",
    "correlation ( amati et al .",
    "2002 ) as well as the @xmath20 correlation ( liang et al .",
    "2010 ) , where @xmath21 is the isotropic energy of the prompt @xmath22-rays . both of them are interpretable if one takes the duration of the bursts to be roughly a constant . ]",
    "the starting point is the extensively discussed speculation that the prompt emission of gamma - ray bursts is mainly from the photosphere which suffers significant modification and its spectrum is normally not thermal - like any longer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "firstly , we discuss _ the simplest scenario _ , in which the ( luminosity , spectral peak energy , efficiency ) of the emission roughly resemble ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) , where @xmath26 are the ( luminosity , temperature , efficiency ) of the photospheric radiation , and @xmath25 and @xmath23 are related to the total luminosity @xmath27 as @xmath28 . in such a scenario , if there are some valid correlations among @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath6 , and @xmath25 , so are @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . for a relativistic baryonic fireball ,",
    "the acceleration and the subsequent photospheric radiation have been initially investigated by @xcite and by @xcite . following these approaches ,",
    "@xcite have recently derived the expressions of the initial radius of the accelerated outflow ( i.e. , @xmath29 ) and the final lorentz factor of the outflow ( i.e. , @xmath6 ) @xmath30 @xmath31 respectively . for @xmath32 ( actually even for @xmath33 ,",
    "the difference between @xmath34 and @xmath35 is only by a factor of @xmath36 ) , eq.([eq : gamma_ph ] ) reduces to the form obtained by @xcite , i.e. , @xmath37    as shown in @xcite , for the outflow launched via the annihilation of neutrino pairs emitting from a hyper - accreting disk , the dimensionless entropy of the initial outflow is related to the total luminosity as @xmath38 ( a @xmath39 is derived if the poorly understood collimation process is ignored @xcite . in the following derivation",
    "we regard k as a  free parameter \" ) .",
    "the final lorentz factor of the accelerated outflow is related to the initial dimensionless entropy as @xmath40 . as long as the thermal radiation is not extremely efficient ( say , @xmath41 ) s ) better - understood afterglow data suggests a typical grb efficiency @xmath42 ( e.g. , fan & piran 2006 ) . ] ,",
    "approximately we have @xmath43 combining eq.(1 ) with eq.(3 ) , we have @xmath44 substituting this relation into eq.(4 ) we have @xmath45 hence eq.(4 ) and eq.(1 ) give @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "finally we have @xmath48 so far we have shown that some correlations should be present .    in the current scenario ,",
    "@xmath49 largely resembles @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "so if we take @xmath51 , the expected relations are @xmath52 respectively , which are nicely in agreement with the four correlations summarized in the first paragraph of this section and the only requirement is that @xmath29 depends on @xmath4 insensitively .",
    "_ interestingly _ , the required @xmath51 is close to that ( @xmath39 ) found in a simple analytical approach @xcite .",
    "actually when adopting eq.(18 ) and eq.(16 ) of fan & wei ( 2011 ) , we have @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the coefficients are consistent with those reported in the literature , as long as @xmath29 is in order of @xmath55 cm . these facts together with the plots in fig.1 illustrate that the correlations found in the literature ( including the normalization ) are indeed interpretable within the photosphere model .",
    "secondly , we adopt the so - called _  generic \" dissipative photospheric model _ developed by @xcite , in which it is shown that at the radius @xmath56 ( see eq.(5 ) therein ) , where radiation and electrons drop out of equilibrium , the spectral peak of the prompt emission forms ( the optical depth is about tens , see eq.(6 ) therein ) rather than that at the photospheric radius . ] and the lorentz factor can be expressed as ( see eq.(9 ) therein ) @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the number of electron+positron pairs per proton and is expected to be moderate . the acceleration calculation yields @xmath59 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with which we have and then @xmath60 .",
    "these coefficients are comparable with that of the observed correlations as long as @xmath61 cm . ]",
    "@xmath62 with the relation @xmath63 , eq.([eq : gen-1 ] ) and eq.([eq : gen-2 ] ) give @xmath64 respectively .",
    "substituting eq.([eq : gen-4 ] ) into eq.([eq : gen-2 ] ) and eq.([eq : gen-3 ] ) , we have @xmath65 @xmath66 respectively .",
    "as long as the radiation efficiency is not very efficient ( say @xmath67 ) , one can take @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath51 we have @xmath69which are roughly consistent with the correlations summarized at the beginning of this section .",
    "both long and short grbs follow the @xmath0 correlation @xcite and the @xmath70 correlation @xcite .",
    "when taking the peak time of the gev emission of the short grb 090510 as the deceleration time of the forward shock , we found that the inferred bulk lorentz factor also follows the @xmath1 correlation .",
    "such facts suggest that the photospheric origin of the prompt emission may also apply to some short bursts .",
    "diagram for the bursts discussed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* excluding those with a @xmath6 in dispute , for example grb 090510 and grb 090328a ) and for the time - resolved thermal radiation of grb 090902b .",
    "the solid line is the best fit @xmath71 obtained in @xcite .",
    "( b ) the @xmath0 diagram for the bursts investigated in @xcite and for the time - resolved thermal radiation of grb 090902b ( please note that we have taken @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the observed temperature ) . the solid line is the best fit @xmath74 found in @xcite.,width=321 ]",
    "prominent thermal radiation components have been identified in grb 090902b , a very bright burst at a redshift @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite divided the whole data set of grb 090902b into several time bins and showed that the spectrum in each bin can be nicely fitted by a thermal component plus a power - law spectral component . by applying the same technique ,",
    "we redo the analysis using _ _ f__ermi / gbm data and the newest _ _",
    "f__ermi / lat pass7 data .",
    "the thermal ( blackbody ) and non - thermal ( power - law ) spectral parameters and fluxes are derived in each time bin .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite and assuming a constant thermal radiation efficiency @xmath76 , the bulk lorentz factors of the outflow shells can be straightforwardly evaluated .",
    "we plot the inferred @xmath6 together with the simultaneous luminosity in the @xmath1 diagram presented by @xcite .",
    "as shown in fig.1(a ) these two sets of data are in agreement with each other . for most bursts discussed in @xcite",
    "the measurement of @xmath6 was based on the modeling of the afterglow light curve(s ) .",
    "the physics involved in such a kind of estimation is completely different from that for grb 090902b .",
    "the agreement between these two sets of data thus not only supports our speculation of the photospheric origin of the prompt emission but also validates the robustness of both methods of evaluating @xmath6 . in fig.1(b ) we plot the time - resolved spectral peak energy versus the simultaneous luminosity of grb 090902b in the @xmath0 diagram presented by @xcite .",
    "again , a nice agreement between these two sets of data is present , in support of the photospheric origin of the prompt emission of some gamma - ray bursts .",
    "finally , we d like to point out that all these correlations have not been reasonably interpreted in either the internal shock models or the internal magnetic energy dissipation models ( the outflow is magnetic ) . in the standard internal shock model",
    ", one has @xmath77 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) then we expect no evident positive correlation between @xmath5 and the luminosity after taking into account the correlation @xmath78 , at odds with the data .",
    "it is also straightforward to show that the correlation @xmath78 predicts an extremely low internal shock efficiency unless the slow material shell has a width much widely than that of the fast shell ( i.e. , the duration of ejecting the slow shell is needed to be a factor of @xmath79 that of ejecting the fast shell , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the bulk lorentz factor of the fast and slow shells , respectively ) . for a magnetic outflow ,",
    "it is recognized in @xcite that an interpretation of @xmath1 correlation is not available yet , let alone interpret the others .",
    "all these facts strongly favor the suggestion that the dominant component of the prompt emission of some grbs may be tightly relevant to the photospheric radiation process , though much work on getting a spectrum nicely matching the data is still needed ( veres , zhang & meszaros 2012 , in preparation ) .",
