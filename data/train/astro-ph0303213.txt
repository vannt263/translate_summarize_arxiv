    "gravitational collapse occurs in a body of mass @xmath0 and radius @xmath1 when its rest energy is of the same order of its gravitational energy , i. e. , @xmath2 .",
    "we would like to argue that for a macroscopic magnetized body , e.g. , composed by neutrons in an external field @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , new physics arises and a sort of collapse occurs when its internal energy density @xmath5 is of the same order than its magnetic energy density @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the magnetization .",
    "this problem is interesting in the context of both cosmology and astrophysics , as for instance in the study of objects such as neutron stars .",
    "a gas of neutral particles having an anomalous magnetic moment ( as a model for neutron stars ( nss ) ; here we assume , as usually , a background of electrons and protons in @xmath8 equilibrium ,   which is demanded by pauli s principle to guarantee neutron stability ) , when placed in extremely strong magnetic fields has a nonlinear ( ferromagnetic ) response to the external field and is also unstable due to the vanishing of the transverse pressure for surface fields strong enough ( @xmath9 g ) . in this phenomenon",
    "quantum effects play an essential role due to the coupling of the particles spins to the microscopic field @xmath3 seen by the particles ( spin - polarization ) . for fields of this order of magnitude",
    "there are values of the density for which the magnetic energy of the system becomes of the same order of magnitude than its total energy . at these physical conditions",
    "any structure of super dense matter composed of neutral particles having a magnetic moment may undergo a transverse collapse when its pressure perpendicular to @xmath3 vanishes .",
    "this implosion is driven by the same mechanism described in @xcite for charged particles .",
    "we present in this new paper , which is a more elaborated version of @xcite , the main ideas concerning the role of ultra strong magnetic fields in a gas of neutral particles : the standard model of nss , as envisioned by duncan and thompson in their model of magnetars@xcite .",
    "the fundamental result that we obtain shows that a ns , i. e. , a neutron gas permeated by a super strong magnetic field is unstable and must collapse .",
    "this inedit result seems to ban the possibility of formation magnetars .",
    "we stress in this respect the fact that similar results were obtained by two different groups : khalilov@xcite and ghosh , mandal and chakrabarty@xcite .",
    "although both teams of researchers arrived to the same conclusion like ours , quite different approaches were pursued .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii reviews the concept of anisotropic pressure in self - gravitating systems like nss . in section iii",
    "are given the tools to construct the energy - momentum tensor of a neutron gas .",
    "section iv discusses the main differences between the classical and quantum collapse of a gas configuration in an approximation - independent way , based on the sign of the electromagnetic response of the medium to the external applied field . in section",
    "v the dynamics of the neutron gas composing a ns is studied in the presence of a magnetic field , followed in section vi by the derivation of its thermodynamical potential and magnetization .",
    "section vii discusses the conditions for the collapse to take place , and an application of this physics to the stability analysis of the proposed magnetars is given .",
    "the main result of this paper shows that such objects should not form if they are envisioned as a standard neutron gas in fermi beta equilibrium as is claimed in the original idea introducing the concept of magnetar .",
    "some closing remarks and further potential applications of this theory are part of the final section .",
    "the issue of local anisotropy in pressures was extensively reviewed by herrera and santos@xcite in a general relativistic approach .",
    "these authors present several physical mechanisms for its origin in both extremely low and very high density systems , which may include astrophysical compact objects . in the case of highly dense systems , it was pointed out that  exotic \" phase transitions could occur during gravitational collapse , which is exactly the problem we are concerned with in this paper",
    ". however , the more fundamental problem regarding the appearance of anisotropic pressures in strongly magnetized compact stars was left open .",
    "more recently , mak and harko @xcite present a class of exact solutions of einstein s equations corresponding to anisotropic stellar configurations which can describe realistic neutron stars .",
    "we want to provide a more detailed description of the arising of anisotropic pressures in a relativistic system like a ns , an essential point in understanding the physics behind the problem of stability of ultra magnetized compact stars . we shall give firstly general arguments to support this our view , and then we concentrate in the specific calculations , in the one - loop approximation , of the thermodynamic potential of the neutron star configuration and its magnetization , the properties upon which the most crucial conclusions can be drawn .    to fix ideas , we shall work in the grand canonical ensemble , and we are considering as subsystem , some region inside the star .",
    "such subsystem is under the influence of the magnetic field created by the rest of the system , which we name @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the response of the subsystem is to polarize itself creating a magnetization @xmath12 in the medium ( the neutron gas ) satisfying the relation : @xmath13 .",
    "obviously , inside the subsystem the microscopic field is @xmath14 , since @xmath3 ( named also magnetic induction ) and the electric field @xmath15 are the _ true fields _ acting on the electric charges and magnetic dipoles of elementary particles @xcite @xcite .",
    "( note , however , that landau in ref.@xcite uses the notation @xmath10 to name the magnetic field in vacuum ) .",
    "the field @xmath3 , as well as @xmath15 , satisfy the maxwell equations for particles in vacuum . in what follows , when we are to discuss the dynamics of the particles in the neutron gas we will sometimes refer to @xmath3 as the _ external magnetic field _ , as is usually named in quantum field theory and astrophysics . for an external distant observer , @xmath16 ( in gaussian units ) since the magnetization is assumed to exist only inside the star .",
    "we emphasize that actually @xmath3 and @xmath10 are external fields within different contexts : @xmath10 is external to the _ subsystem _ object of study in the grand canonical ensemble , whereas @xmath3 is external to any particle chosen in the subsystem ( it feels , in addition to @xmath10 , the contribution from the magnetization field @xmath17 due to the other particles of the subsystem ) .    in the case of a gas of electrically charged particles in an external constant magnetic field @xmath3 , in classical electrodynamics",
    ", it is the lorentz force @xmath18 the source of an asymmetry in the pressure components parallel and perpendicular to @xmath19 . by writing @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , calling @xmath22 as the @xmath23-th component of the force density , and substituting @xmath24 , one has    @xmath25    by multiplying by @xmath26 and assuming @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( actually it is also @xmath29 ) , only the first term in ( [ lfd ] ) remains nonzero and one recovers an expression for the lorentz force , which is obviously perpendicular to the field @xmath3 . for the corresponding pressure it yields @xmath30 .",
    "this is a classical effect and obviously @xmath31 must be added to the usual kinetic isotropic pressure @xmath32 , so that the total transverse pressure becomes @xmath33 . as in classical electrodynamics , by lenz law , @xmath34 is opposite to @xmath19 ( spin effects are neglected ) , then @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "the opposite case occurs when @xmath34 is parallel to @xmath37 , which occurs in the quantum case , i.e. , when spin effects are taken into account .",
    "we alert , however , that in the definitions and derivations that follows use will be done of the magnitudes @xmath38 and @xmath39 of both vectors @xmath40 and @xmath41 instead of the vectors themselves .",
    "based on more fundamental grounds , one may write the general structure of the energy - momentum tensor of a neutron gas in an external field @xmath40 in the same way as one does to construct general tensors , as the polarization operator tensors @xcite , for instance . in an external field",
    "@xmath42 , in addition to the basic 4-velocity vectors of the medium , @xmath43 , and particle momentum @xmath44 , we have two extra vectors @xmath45 , to form a basis of independent vectors ( in what follows we shall use the notation @xmath46 . from them we may build a set of basic tensors which , together with the tensors @xmath47 , @xmath42 , @xmath48 , serves as a basis in terms of which we can expand any tensor structure related to the particle dynamics , in particular , the energy - momentum tensor . however , to get rid of tensor structures containing off - diagonal terms , which would correspond to unwanted shearing stresses in the fluid rest frame @xmath49 , we exclude some of them , i. e. , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath42 , @xmath52 , or any of its combinations . by following the arguments used in @xcite ,",
    "we conclude that we are left in the present case with three basic tensors : @xmath53 to describe the dynamics of such a neutron gas .",
    "thus , the structure of such an energy - momentum tensor is then expected to be of the form    @xmath54    where @xmath55 ; and @xmath56 is the isotropic pressure term , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in the present case the second of these tensors",
    "can be written in a simpler form as @xmath59 .",
    "the tensor ( [ emts ] ) has then the spatial eigenvalues @xmath60 , and the time eigenvalue @xmath61 , since @xmath62 .",
    "these eigenvalues exhibit the anisotropy in pressures perpendicular and parallel to @xmath63 .",
    "in dealing with a quantum gas in an external field we shall assume that the sources of the field @xmath64 are either classical ( currents ) or due to quantum effects .",
    "although it is out of the scope of this paper to discuss the mechanism for producing such field , we suggest , however , some viable sources able to induce a self - consistent field , as for instance a condensate of the vector meson @xmath65 , the neutron spin - spin ferromagnetic @xcite coupling ( see below ) , or even by diquark @xcite condensation .    as in the case of the electron in an atom",
    "the basic dynamics in our present case is described by the dirac equation in an external field , in place of the lorentz force . according to the ehrenfest theorem , classical dynamics",
    "is contained on the adequate average of quantum dynamics . but quantum dynamics leads also to several new phenomena not having classical partner . after solving the dirac equation",
    "one gets the energy eigenvalue spectrum @xcite .",
    "this energy depends on the microscopic magnetic field @xmath63 through some interaction term in the initial lagrangian .",
    "these energy eigenvalues , after the quantum statistical average , determine the thermodynamic properties , such as the neutron gas pressure . if the coupling constant is turned to zero , the particles would not feel any pressure coming from the external field .",
    "thus , since the classical maxwell stress tensor of the field @xmath66 does not express by itself the interaction with the particles , i. e. , it expresses the momentum and energy of the external field , we have no need to add it to the expression ( [ tps ] ) below .",
    "the tensor ( [ tps ] ) contains already the basic tensor structures of the problem , including the maxwell stress tensor of the field @xmath63 , which depends on the external field @xmath66 and the magnetization @xmath67 .",
    "the total external field @xmath63 contributes with virtual particles , expressed through the euler - heisenberg vacuum terms arising in the regularization of the quantum vacuum terms @xcite .",
    "these vacuum terms appear in the calculation of the basic statistical quantity , the thermodynamical potential : @xmath68 , where @xmath69 , the grand partition function , is built up on the particle spectrum .",
    "our thermodynamical potential is the sum of two terms , @xmath70 , the finite statistical term @xmath71 plus the vacuum field contribution @xmath72 , which is divergent . in the process of regularization , it absorbs the classical field energy density term @xmath73 .",
    "we observe here that landau , in p.69 of ref.@xcite , uses the specific term _ thermodynamic potential _ , denoted by @xmath74 in that reference , to name what in western literature is known as gibbs free energy , which is denoted by g. our thermodynamic potential is just what landau defines as  new thermodynamic potential @xmath75 \" , but we have taken it per unit volume , which is dependent on @xmath76 and @xmath77 in absence of external field , and in our case is dependent also on @xmath63 .",
    "observe that @xmath78 .",
    "in the zero field case , it would be @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the isotropic pressure . due to the spatial anisotropy introduced by the magnetic field @xmath63 , the pressures are not the same in all directions , and only in the direction parallel to @xmath63 it adquires the value @xmath81 ( see below ) .",
    "the coupling of the spin dipole moment of neutrons in an external magnetic field @xmath63 produces a loss of rotational symmetry of the particle spectrum ( in what follows we will consider @xmath63 along the @xmath82 axis ) . from the spectrum , which is expressed in terms of @xmath63 , by the standard methods of finite temperature quantum field theory",
    ", we obtain the thermodynamical potential ( per unit volume ) @xmath83 , and from it all the thermodynamic properties of the system , in particular its magnetization , as is done by huang @xcite ( p. 237 ) , which is the statistical average @xmath84 .    notice that this definition is consistent with our convention by which thermodynamical quantities are defined in terms of the microscopic magnetic field @xmath63 acting on the particles as an independent variable",
    "( see for instance ref.@xcite ) , instead of using the quantity @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the thermodynamical variable conjugated to the magnetic field @xmath63 is the quantity @xmath85 , the system magnetization as introduced above .",
    "we may write then    @xmath86    where @xmath87 is the term corresponding to the zero magnetic field pressure .",
    "one must emphasize that in the quantum relativistic case @xmath75 depends on @xmath63 nonlinearly . from the explicit expression for @xmath75 given in another section below",
    ", one finds that the dependence of the energy spectrum on the particle momentum is not rotational invariant .",
    "this fact determines a reduction of the symmetry of the otherwise isotropic thermodynamic properties of the system such as the pressure , which is expected to be axially - symmetric for the reasons pointed out above .    by using the green functions method",
    "it is found that the energy - momentum tensor of matter in an external constant magnetic field obeys the general structure ( [ emts ] ) , and we have @xcite    @xmath88    where @xmath89 run over the species involved .",
    "below we will take @xmath90 to describe teh neutron , proton and electron component of the star gas .",
    "expression ( [ tps ] ) in the zero field limit reproduces the usual isotropic energy - momentum tensor @xmath91 of a perfect fluid . from eq.([tps ] ) the spatial components are @xmath92 .",
    "the time component @xmath93 , in which @xmath94 are quantities of the same order of magnitude .",
    "we shall assume that inside a stable ns there is locally a balance between the mechanical stresses ( and forces ) from the pressure exerted by the quantum gas and the gravitational stress , i. e. , the gravitational force per unit area , exerted by the star mass , as defined below by equations ( [ pg]),([pg1 ] ) . by abusing a bit of the phrasing we shall refer over the paper to this last one as the  gravitational pressure \" , in an attempt to turn more meaningful discussions regarding effects of the gas pressure and those stemming from its own gravity . in the case of a neutron star the correct treatment of this problem requires of general relativistic corrections@xcite .",
    "however , for the general purpose of this paper we consider here the problem in a rough manner , in a similar fashion as it was done in the white dwarf case with zero magnetic field @xcite , in newtonian gravity .",
    "if @xmath95 is an element of surface and @xmath96 an increase in the coordinate @xmath97 , one can express the balance between the work done on the star and the variation of its gravitational energy , @xmath98 , under a small change of volume @xmath99 as    @xmath100    where the quantity in parenthesis must be zero , and describes the balance of forces .",
    "we will use now cylindrical coordinates with the @xmath101 axis parallel to @xmath63 , and assume that the shape of the deformed star can be ( very roughly ) approximated by the simplified model of a cylinder of height @xmath102 and radius @xmath103 ( we could equally use as a simple model a cylinder of height @xmath102 ended by two half - spheres of radius @xmath103 .",
    "the equations ( [ pg ] ) and ( [ pg1 ] ) below would differ by unimportant numerical factors ) .",
    "we assume also that the change of the cylinder s volume @xmath99 and surface @xmath104 are small , so that the total surface of the star @xmath105 is approximately constant .",
    "then we have @xmath106 , @xmath107 and integrating we get the equilibrium between the gravitational and gas pressures @xmath108 and @xmath109 , where    @xmath110    and @xmath111    eqs.([pg]),([pg1 ] ) are to be interpreted respectively as the transverse and longitudinal `` gravitational pressures '' in the sense defined above . by assuming that @xmath112 and @xmath113 are quantities of the same order , to preserve the balance of transverse pressures",
    "when @xmath114 decreases ( due to the increase of the product @xmath115 ) , the quantity @xmath116 must decrease .",
    "this is achieved whenever @xmath102 increases faster than @xmath103 decreases ( all this can be seen by assuming that the total surface @xmath117 and @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is a parameter like time ) . in that case",
    "the outcome is a stretching of the body along the direction of @xmath63 .",
    "thus , the anisotropy of pressures in our problem suggests that matter in the body is also distributed anisotropically , what leads to prolate isobaric surfaces .",
    "the condition @xmath120 implies also that @xmath121 . as @xmath122 ,",
    "an instability arises in the system leading to a transverse collapse .",
    "thus , as pointed out in the introduction , new physics arise in connection with the vanishing of the transverse pressure , @xmath120 .",
    "this peculiar behavior will be discussed in the forthcoming sections .    by writing @xmath123",
    ", one may formally write @xmath124 .",
    "we remind that as @xmath125 , the last expression is consistent with what would be obtained in the classical nonrelativistic case @xcite , where @xmath126 is the helmholtz free energy and @xmath127 @xmath128 as the gibbs free energy .",
    "because of our definition of @xmath129 , the last term is given in terms of @xmath63 and not in terms of @xmath66 .",
    "as we have    @xmath130    and also    @xmath131    it is straightforward to see that the spatial components of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) can be rewritten as    @xmath134    where @xmath135 $ ] is the maxwell stress tensor for the microscopic field @xmath63 , and @xmath136 $ ] is the minkowski tensor for relativistic nonlinear media ( see below ) .",
    "this last term reduces to the usual expression in the nonrelativistic limit if @xmath66 depends linearly on @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the definition ( [ mmin ] ) expresses the total pressure as a sum of an isotropic pure mechanical pressure ( independent of the electromagnetic field ) plus a pressure coming from the minkowski tensor due to the interaction of the external field @xmath66 with the microscopic field @xmath63 , plus the maxwell stress tensor of the microscopic field @xmath63 .",
    "if @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 . in this case",
    "the magnetic field is kept self - consistently .    at this point",
    "we want to refer to the recent paper by khalilov @xcite where a similar problem to the present one is studied .",
    "however , the expression for the stress tensor in a medium is taken as given only by the linear approximation of the minkowski tensor term .",
    "this approach is not justified in the relativistic case .",
    "further , the maxwell tensor of the microscopic field @xmath63 and the isotropic @xmath140 terms are omitted .",
    "this leads the author to wrongly conclude that the collapse occurs like in the classical case ( see below ) , that is , along the @xmath141 field , in contradiction to our present results and those of @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a consistent approach , as we have followed here , and discussed in the accompanying paper @xcite , leads to opposite results compared to those of ref .",
    "@xcite in what concerns the spatial direction of collapse , although the fundamental issue regarding the collapse of the neutron star remains taking place in both theories .",
    "note , in addition , that refs . @xcite and @xcite , where the problem was also studied , did not take into account the dynamical effects of the strong ( and super strong ) magnetic fields supposed to exist in the core of canonical nss , see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thence , it is the contention of this paper to address this open issue .",
    "the novel results obtained here point out to the occurrence of new physics and processes in the ( relativistic ) astrophysics of compact objects that were not manifest in previous papers .",
    "in ref.@xcite we found that a relativistic degenerate electron gas placed in a strong external magnetic field @xmath63 is confined to a finite set of landau quantum states .",
    "as the field is increased the maximum landau quantum number is decreased favoring the arising of either a paramagnetic or a ferromagnetic response through a positive magnetization @xmath129 , up to the case in which only the ground state is occupied .",
    "the gas then becomes topologically one dimensional , and in consequence the pressure transverse to the field vanishes for fields @xmath142 @xcite .",
    "thus , the electron gas becomes unstable due to the decrease of the transverse pressure for fields strong enough , and the outcome is a collapse .    for neutrons",
    "the magnetization is always positive ( see arguments below ) and nonlinear , what leads to a sort of ferromagnetic behavior . for fields strong enough the pressure transverse to the field , @xmath143 , is considerably decreased and may vanish . if we assume that extremely magnetized nss , as the duncan and thompson magnetars@xcite , have fields @xmath144 g , and that inside the star @xmath63 increases by following a dipole law @xmath145 , we expect near its surface magnetic fields ranging from @xmath146g@xcite up to values of order @xmath147 g in its core@xcite , where the field is maintained self - consistently , i. e. , @xmath137 . for fields of this order of magnitude super dense matter composed of neutral particles having a magnetic moment may undergo a transverse collapse since @xmath148 vanishes .",
    "as discussed below , the emerging physics seems to ban the possibility of magnetar formation .",
    "the outcome of such a collapse might be a compact star endowed with canonical magnetic field , as discussed below .    in the classical case",
    "in which the response of the medium is due to the lenz law , the magnetization is opposite to the external field @xmath66 and it may happen that @xmath149 .",
    "this also occurs in the diamagnetic case",
    ". then @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "note that the opposite occurs in some permeable materials where @xmath152 and @xmath153 is small in comparison to either @xmath129 and @xmath63 ; this is due to ferromagnetic effects which have quantum origin , as in the neutron gas .    in the case of a classical magnetized gas , as @xmath154",
    ", this leads to the earth - like oblatening effect described above .",
    "but opposite to this , for the critical quantum configuration of the ns gas the coupling of the spin magnetic dipole with the magnetic field @xmath155 plays the main role , and @xmath152 ( see eq.([test ] ) below and the subsequent discussion where this is shown explicitly ) , leading to ferromagnetic effects .",
    "the situation then is reversed and @xmath148 is smaller than @xmath156 in the amount @xmath115 and it vanishes for @xmath157 leading , conversely , to a prolate configuration .    in classical electrodynamics",
    "@xcite it is suggested that the total pressure is given by the sum of the maxwell stress tensor @xmath158 plus an isotropic pressure ( @xmath32 ) term . in the case of a constant magnetic field parallel to the @xmath82 axis ,",
    "the total pressure tensor reads @xmath159 or @xmath160 and @xmath161    as pointed out before , the body deforms under the action of these anisotropic pressures .",
    "if the longitudinal pressure decreases , the body flattens along the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "thus , in this pure classical case , for the extreme limit of flattening , @xmath162 and @xmath163 , and the body would collapse as a disk or a ring perpendicular to the field .",
    "starting from general relativistic considerations it has been reported @xcite the existence of a maximum magnetic field for having stationary configurations of nss .",
    "( we interprete that result as indicating the occurrence of a classical collapse for fields larger than the maximum ) .",
    "this field induces a toroidal configuration , which is topologically equivalent to a ring . in the quantum case , for degenerate fermions , as @xmath164",
    "it is @xmath143 which is decreased by increasing @xmath63 . as the ns is in equilibrium under the balance of neutron and `` gravitational '' pressures , the body stretches along the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "thus , for any density there are values of the field @xmath63 high enough such that these pressures can not counterbalance each other leading to a collapse perpendicular to the field for @xmath165 .",
    "this collapse would leave as a remnant a nucleons plus a bose - einstein - like condensate , a hybrid or strange star with canonical magnetic field @xcite , or a distorted ( `` cigar - like '' ) black hole .",
    "our previous considerations are approximation - independent . in order to discuss an specific model",
    ", we shall start by computing the free particle spectrum for neutral particles in a magnetic field .",
    "for free neutrons in a magnetic field @xmath63 we have the dirac equation for neutral particles with anomalous magnetic moment @xcite    @xmath166    where @xmath167 is the spin tensor , and @xmath168 is the electromagnetic field tensor describing @xmath63 . by solving this equation",
    "we get the eigenvalues @xcite",
    "@xmath169    where @xmath170 , @xmath171 are respectively the momentum components along and perpendicular to the magnetic field @xmath63 , @xmath172 is the neutron mass , @xmath173 ( @xmath174 is the nuclear magneton ) , @xmath175 are the @xmath176 eigenvalues corresponding to the two orientations of the magnetic moment ( parallel and antiparallel ) with regards to the field @xmath63 .",
    "here we make the assumption that the magnetic moment remains constant for large magnetic fields . actually , this is not so .",
    "radiative corrections change its value as a function of @xmath63 .",
    "this problem is , however , beyond the scope of the present approach .    from ( [ ein ] )",
    "we see that although the hamiltonian is linear in @xmath63 , the eigenvalues depend on @xmath63 nonlinearly .",
    "this makes the relativistic thermodynamic and electromagnetic properties of the system of neutrons very different from the nonrelativistic case .",
    "for instance , all thermodynamic quantities , @xmath75 , @xmath129 ( and in consequence , @xmath153 ) , and @xmath177 are also nonlinear functions of @xmath63 . the expression ( [ ein ] ) also shows manifestly the change of spherical to axial symmetry with regard to momentum components .",
    "_ this anisotropy in the dynamics is expected to be reflected in an anisotropy in the thermodynamic properties of the system , as it is expressed by the difference between the transverse and longitudinal pressures discussed earlier on an approximation - independent basis .",
    "_    the partition function @xmath178 is obtained from the density matrix describing the model @xmath179 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath180 ( @xmath181 ) are the chemical potentials associated with the lepton , baryon and electric charge conservation , so that @xmath182 , @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "the thermodynamical potential can be written as @xmath185 .",
    "usually the eigenvalues of @xmath186 contain the contribution from neutrons , protons , electrons and some meson species , and the densities are @xmath187 , where @xmath188 we name @xmath189 , @xmath190 the total thermodynamical potential and magnetization , respectively .    a standard procedure is to work in the mean field approximation in which the meson fields @xmath191 are taken as constant , as done in refs.@xcite , @xcite , through which the mass spectrum of baryons is corrected and strong repulsive interactions between them is found .",
    "however , for simplicity we will keep the spectra in the tree approximation to obtain the one - loop approximation for @xmath192 , and neglect the statistical contribution from meson terms in @xmath192 as compared with those of fermions ( for them @xmath193 ) except for fields @xmath194 g , since the contribution of the @xmath65 vector meson condensate to @xmath129 becomes relevant , and in analogy with @xmath195-s@xcite , leads to a self - consistent spontaneous magnetization @xmath196 , where @xmath197 is the condensate density .",
    "however , for such fields the magnetic pressure : @xmath198 overwhelms the kinetic pressure term @xmath32 ( of order @xmath199 dynes/@xmath200 ) leading to @xmath201 and the star is definitely unstable : it collapses .",
    "this mechanism is valid for other quasi - particle vector boson condensates , as di - quarks , which may be formed in the medium even for smaller values of the field @xmath63 @xcite .",

    "although we used previously the term ferromagnetic to denote the non - linear response of the medium to the external field , what we have considered actually in our previous calculations is the occurrence of relativistic pauli s paramagnetism .",
    "we have not fully considered the spin - spin coupling , which would lead more definitely to heisenberg ferromagnetism , and is physically reasonable to expect its appearance in nuclear matter for densities high enough .",

    "the problem has been studied under one gluon exchange interaction , and conditions for ferromagnetism may arise .",
    "although the problem requires further research , one expects that if heisenberg ferromagnetism is to appear , it would increase the magnetization to @xmath343 , where @xmath344 is the internal field parameter . if @xmath345 our previous estimates for the vanishing of the transverse pressure might be largely exceeded , with the arising of a new spontaneous magnetization @xmath346 .",

    "next we briefly review the basic ideas supporting the theory of magnetars and then show why these hypothetical objects can not survive after reaching the claimed super strong magnetic fields .",
    "we then present prospectives for a hybrid or strange star to appear as a remnant of the quantum magnetic collapse of a ns .",
    "according to duncan and thompson@xcite , nss with very high dipole surface magnetic field strength , @xmath352 $ ] g , may form when ( classical ) conditions for a helical dynamo action are efficiently met during the seconds following the core - collapse and bounce in a supernova ( sn ) explosion@xcite .",

    "the huge rotational energy of a ns spinning at : @xmath365khz , is leaked out via _ magnetic braking _ and an enormous energy is injected into the sn remnant .",
    "this process may explain the power emitted by a _ plerion .",
    "_    as shown above , at the end of the sn core collapse we are left with a rapidly rotating ns endowed with with an extremely strong magnetic field ( esmf ) strength and a large matter density @xmath366 $ ] g @xmath238 .",
    "as illustrated in figure 1 , those are the conditions for the quantum instability to start to dominate the dynamics of the young pulsar . at this stage",
    ", the magnetic pressure inwards may overpass the star energy density at its equator and the collapse becomes unavoidable . as the collapse proceeds , higher and higher densities are reached till the point the supranuclear density may reverse the direction of implosion . a hybrid or strange star ( ss ) may have formed .",
    "we explore next this plausible outcome , among the other possibilities quoted above . from that moment , the sound wave generated at the core bounce builds itself into a shock wave traveling through the star at @xmath367 km s@xmath368 .",
    "although the esmf strength could be quite large as long as the collapse advances , the huge kinetic energy , @xmath369 erg , the mean energy obtained in calculations of energy release in neutron star phase transitions to strange ( _ twin _ ) stars @xcite and some _ prompt shock _ supernovae ( @xmath370  erg ) @xcite , carried away by the shock wave drives a kind of supernova explosion inasmuch as in the quark nova model and similar scenarios @xcite .",
    "such a huge _ ram _ pressure may counterbalance the magnetic pressure , and even surpass it , i. e. ,    @xmath371    at a location from the star center equivalent to the alfvn radius of the magnetar    @xmath372^{1/7 } \\sim 80~ \\rm km.\\ ] ]    this radius is quite large , about 7 times the ns radius ( see table 1 ) .",
    "here @xmath373 defines the accretion rate of the free - falling overlaying material making up the ns crust , which is left out when the transition occurs ( see definitions and further details in ref.@xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , it is quite legitimated to expect that most of the magnetic energy stored inside the magnetosphere to be drained out of the alfvn radius .",
    "notice in addition that the strange star radius scales as : @xmath374 , where the densities ratio reads : @xmath375 .",
    "other relations between both the stars can be obtained by using conservation laws or appropriate scalings .    then the esmf lines are pushed out and finally broken , in a process inverse to the standard accretion one , from @xmath376 onwards into the sn remnant surroundings , as a violent explosion that dissipates a large part of the magnetic flux @xmath377 and energy trapped inside the magnetar magnetosphere@xcite .",
    "energy from the magnetic field can be dissipated via vacuum polarization and electron - positron pairs creation , as well as acceleration of charged matter flowing away ( synchroton and curvature losses @xcite with the explosion and material trapped in the star magnetosphere and nearby the alfvn radius .",
    "this is analogous to the mechanism operating during a solar flare or a coronal mass - ejection , where the very high @xmath63 in a given sun - spot is drastically diminished after flaring for a short period of time ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in",
    "the sun spots outbursts and coronal mass ejections launch into space part of the solar wind of charged and neutral particles passing by the earth@xcite . in the case of an imploding ns , the phase of open magnetic field lines over which the strange star is acting as a _ propeller _ lasts for about @xmath378 $ ]  s , with @xmath379 the propeller luminosity , and @xmath380 the star rotational energy .",
    "thence , the large amount of matter ejected from the strange star at such large velocities and the pairs created , in the vacuum breakdown , drains out the dipole field of the remnant below the quantum electrodynamic limit of @xmath381 g @xcite .    to give an insight into this piece of the physics of the problem , notice that once the propeller phase is over and no more luminosity is coming from that mechanism , the magnetic field lines can recombine again if the energy released in this new stable phase is essentially the strange star rotational dipole luminosity ( as the one from a millisecond pulsar ) , which then becomes the star dominant mechanism of energy emission , that is    @xmath382    for the parameters shown in table 1 and the observed luminosity from fast rotating pulsars , this relation implies a new equilibrium magnetic field @xmath383  g , which is below the quantum electrodynamics threshold .",
    "since all the differential rotation has been dragged up to build up the former esmf , then nothing else remains to make the magnetic field to grow to its pre - collapse value .",
    "thence no such ultra high @xmath63 should reappear .",
    "we may be left with a sub - millisecond strange star@xcite or a hybrid star@xcite with \" canonical  field strength , but no any magnetar .",
    "we note in passing that the above theoretical result is attained on the standardized assumption that the structure of the magnetic field of the pulsar is dipolar .",
    "this premise is underlying to the claim by kouveliotou et al.@xcite that a magnetar had been discovered in the soft gamma - ray repeater source sgr 1806 - 20 .",
    "notwithstanding , for other ns ( multipolar or uniform ) field configurations we do expect the overall behavior here discussed to persist , since once the spin - spin coupling is taken into account the unavoidable consequence is the appearance of a ferromagnetic ( axial ) configuration or structure which is dipolar in nature , and therefore the theory propound here still holds , because the magnetic field could then be amplified by a factor @xmath384 ) , putting the nascent pulsar above the threshold for stability , and the collapse ensues . rephrasing this",
    ", one can think of this theory as a field - configuration independent constraint on initial ns magnetic field strengths .    in looking for other contexts",
    "far from those involving compact remnant stars , we noticed that recent `` tabletop astrophysics '' experiments performed by c. wieman et al.@xcite have succeeded in refining sophisticated techniques to switch atoms in a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite from states of implosion to states of re - expansion ( or explosion ) . in certain cases they observed that some collapses appear rather similar to microscopic supernovae .",
    "the initial implosion is followed by an explosion in which atoms are ejected as a hollow ball or in narrow jets , like in the collapse and rebound of a exploding star that forms characteristic expanding balls or streams of outflowing gas .",
    "the wieman team named the phenomenon `` bosenovae '' because of the similarities with typical supernovae .",
    "in fact , in both phenomena some material is left after the implosion as a compact object .",
    "because of the similarity of the physics of bose - einstein condensates with the one we presented above , we are confident that this our theory can also be adapted to explain these impressive results by wieman et al.@xcite ; ketterle and anglin @xcite .",
    "the main feature of these oscillating bose - einstein condensates , said to be a scale - down version of either a neutron star or a white dwarf@xcite , is that for some critical fields what appears is an attractive force between the atoms and the condensate implodes and rebounds driven by some sort of internal negative pressure .",
    "we claim in this paper ( a detailed description of becs phenomenology is to be given in a work in preparation@xcite ) that such a negative pressure could be explained in the context of the theory introduced in this paper , since a precise relationship between gas density and magnetic field strength in the bec is settled out by switching the atoms between attractive and non - attractive states .",
    "thence the negative pressure acts as the equivalent of an attractive force among the atoms directed towards the magnetic field axis , leading to the bec implosion .",
    "we conclude by claiming that if a degenerate neutron gas is under the action of a super strong magnetic field @xmath385 , for values of the density typical of ns matter its transverse pressure vanishes , the outcome being a transverse collapse .",
    "this phenomenon establishes a strong bound on the magnetic field strength expected to be found in any stable neutron star pulsar , regardless of its initial field configuration , and suggests a possible endpoint in the early evolution of highly magnetized neutron stars .",
    "they could likely be a mixed phase of nucleons and a @xmath386 meson condensate , a hybrid or strange star , or a distorted black hole but no any magnetar at all .",
    "we point out , nonetheless , that if by any mechanism a strange star could be formed directly in a supernova exlposion ( which is uncertain , but not ruled out ) and if vigorous dynamo action operates in the strange quark matter bulk , `` pulsars '' with fields higher than @xmath288 could still be formed . in other words , if any magnetars exist , they can not be neutron stars .",
    "we use the integral representation    @xmath387    we regularize the divergent term dependent on @xmath388 in ( [ ar ] ) , by introducing a small quantity @xmath389 as the lower limit in the integral , and neglecting the term independent of @xmath388    @xmath390    by taking @xmath391 and substituting in ( [ ont1 ] ) and performing the gaussian integral on @xmath170 , one obtains    @xmath392    by substituting @xmath393 one is left with the expression    @xmath394    by introducing the new variable @xmath395 , the second integral in ( [ ar3 ] ) becomes    @xmath396y}\\sinh(2qb(w+m_n)y)\\label{ar4}.\\ ] ]    after subtracting to @xmath397 and @xmath398 $ ] the first two terms in their series expansion , one can take @xmath399 and obtain the finite expression ( [ nvac ] ) .",

    "<S> this fixes a limit to the fields to be observable in stable neutron star pulsars as a function of their density . the final structure left over after the implosion might be a mixed phase of nucleons and meson condensate , a strange star , or a highly distorted black hole or black `` cigar '' , but no any magnetar , if viewed as a super strongly magnetized neutron star </S>",
    "<S> however , we do not exclude the possibility of a superstrong magnetic fields arising in supernova explosions which lead directly to strange stars . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , if any magnetars exist , they can not be neutron stars . </S>"
