    "doppler measurements are very well studied in the case of weak - field approximation of the gravitational field of ( arbitrary moving ) isolated sources  @xcite . however , a similarly careful analysis of the cosmological effects on doppler measurements is , in our opinion , still lacking .",

    "@xmath78 denotes the hubble parameter , which in ( [ eq : doppler - tracking - approx ] ) can be evaluated at any of the times in the interval @xmath79 $ ] .",
    "now , while tracking a spacecraft by continuously emitting a radar signal with constant frequency @xmath80 the whole construction is pushed forward in time .",

    "this is exactly the result one obtains from newtonian physics .",
    "leading order corrections are obtained by going to quadratic order in @xmath74 and also keeping mixed terms @xmath117 .",
    "the result is @xmath118 at this point it is crucial to understand how @xmath106 relates to the acceleration that appears on the left - hand side of newton s equation of motion .",
    "the latter is derived as the weak - field and slow - motion approximation of the spatial part of the geodesic equation .",
    "recall that ` spatial part ' refers to the choice of the observer field , from which the establishment of a newtonian equation always depends .",
    "in addition , in order to write down a newtonian equation , we need to use spatial coordinates of direct metrical significance .",
    "this is achieved by using a rescaled radial coordinate , @xmath119 such that @xmath120 is now the proper geodesic distance to the origin ( us ) within each time slice of constant @xmath66 .",
    "the time coordinate remains unchanged , @xmath121 , so that @xmath122 the observer field is now the normalization of that field : @xmath123 it also results from applying a ( spacetime dependent ) boost of parameter @xmath124 in the local planes spanned by @xmath14 and @xmath125 .",
    "note also that @xmath126 is hypersurface orthogonal , though clearly not orthogonal to the slices of constant @xmath66 .",
    "the spatial projection of the geodesic equation with respect to @xmath126 up to quadratic order in @xmath127 and linear order in @xmath128 turns out to be @xmath129 this is the form of the equation of motion in which dynamical considerations are most conveniently addressed  ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "hence in the above formulae for the doppler tracking we need to express the relative accelerations and velocities defined w.r.t .",
    "@xmath14 in terms of relative accelerations and velocities w.r.t .  @xmath126 . in the flrw case",
    "these transformations are given in @xcite .",
    "for a general spacetime they can be found e.g.  in  @xcite .",
    "however , for our discussion it is sufficient to consider the approximated doppler tracking formula ( [ eq : doppler - tracking - radial - quadratic ] ) and within its level of approximation it makes no difference whether we refer spatial acceleration and velocities w.r.t .",
    "@xmath14 or w.r.t .",
    "hence ( [ eq : doppler - tracking - radial - quadratic ] ) gives the sought - after relation between the two - way doppler measurement and the kinematical quantities that enter the newtonian equation .",
    "looking at ( [ eq : doppler - tracking - radial - quadratic ] ) we see , among other corrections , an additional acceleration term @xmath130 ( reintroducing the speed of light @xmath131 ) .",
    "hence the sometimes alleged @xmath132 acceleration term  @xcite is actually suppressed by a factor @xmath74 , as already pointed out in  @xcite , though we can not agree with the derivation given there .",
    "in particular we conclude that , even if the universe did expand down to scales of the solar system , there would be no effect of the same order of magnitude as the pioneer anomaly . besides ,",
    "notice that the above mentioned correction points in outer direction and hence opposite to the pioneer anomalous acceleration .",
    "one expects that this conclusion remains true in the presence of an isolated local inhomogeneity , such as a single star , since the contributions coming from the ` gravitational ' red - shift of the star cancel out in the two - way process .",
    "insofar as such an inhomogeneity can be modeled by the mcvittie metric this is explicitly shown in the next section .",
    "the so - called ` flat ' mcvittie model with central mass @xmath133 and scale - factor @xmath134 is given by the spacetime metric @xmath135 together with a cosmological observer - field @xmath136 along which the cosmological matter , given by an ideal fluid with pressure , moves .",
    "the red - shift formula for a radial light ray in a mcvittie spacetime is easily computed up to linear order in @xmath137 and @xmath138 to be @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath78 as previously . in case @xmath141",
    "this reduces to the familiar gravitational red - shift relation in schwarzschild spacetime , as it should . by ( [ eq : mcvittie - redshift ] )",
    "one sees that the main formula ( [ eq : doppler - tracking ] ) for the two - way doppler frequency - shift we derived in the flrw case still remains valid for the mcvittie case in linear order in @xmath115 and @xmath138 .",
    "the reason is simply that the gravitational contribution to the red - shift ( coming from the factors @xmath142 in ( [ eq : mcvittie - redshift ] ) ) vanishes in the two - way process within the considered approximation .",
    "as in the previous section , we wish to compute the doppler frequency - shift rate measured by an observer ( us ) along @xmath14 who exchanges light ( radar ) signals with a spacecraft moving along an arbitrary worldline @xmath40 ( see figure [ fig : doppler - tracking ] ) . for this",
    "we need the generally valid relations ( [ eq : beta - square - derivative ] ) and ( [ eq : beta - kappa - derivative ] ) and the relations ( [ eq : reflection - time - derivative ] ) and ( [ eq : emission - time - derivative ] ) which , fortunately , hold exactly also in the mcvittie case , provided that central mass , observer , and spacecraft are aligned .",
    "the latter will be assumed henceforth .",
    "a difference to the flrw case is that here @xmath66 is no longer the eigentime along the observer s worldline .",
    "rather , to get the measured frequency - shift rate , we have to differentiate ( [ eq : doppler - tracking ] ) with @xmath143 . when differentiating the kinematical factor on the r.h.s .  of ( [ eq : doppler - tracking ] ) we proceed as before but now take into account that @xmath144 on functions along the spacecraft s worldline @xmath40 , where @xmath102 is its arc - length",
    "this leads to the formula @xmath145 which is valid in linear order in @xmath113 and @xmath138 and quadratic order in @xmath74 , and differs from ( [ eq : doppler - tracking - radial - quadratic ] ) merely in the term containing @xmath133 ( note that in ( [ eq : doppler - tracking - radial - quadratic ] ) @xmath146 ) .",
    "formula ( [ eq : mcvittie - doppler - tracking ] ) shows that in the mcvittie case , too , the acceleration correction term @xmath132 is suppressed by a factor @xmath74 .    as for the flrw case",

    "@xmath126 . as previously",

    "@xmath40 was unspecified .",
    "let us now assume @xmath40 to be a geodesic . in leading order in @xmath147 and @xmath148 and linear order in @xmath128",
    "the geodesic equation then leads to the following expression for the spatial acceleration w.r.t .",
    "@xmath126 : @xmath149 here we made use of the identity @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the deceleration parameter , which shows that @xmath152 is of quadratic order in @xmath153 , given that @xmath151 is not a large number .",
    "formula ( [ eq : mcv - newton - eq ] ) is the form of the equation of motion in the next - to - newtonian approximation in which dynamical considerations are most conveniently addressed  ( see again @xcite and references therein ) .    in the special case of purely radial motion , insertion of ( [ eq : mcv - newton - eq ] ) into ( [ eq : mcvittie - doppler - tracking ] ) gives a formula predicting the two - way doppler - shift rate in linear order in @xmath154 and @xmath148 and quadratic order in @xmath128 : @xmath155 hence there are two corrections to the newtonian contribution .",
    "one is proportional to @xmath153 and stems from the cosmological expansion , the other is independent of @xmath153 and of purely special - relativistic origin , as one might check explicitly .",
    "their ratio is ( up to a factor @xmath156 ) given by the square of the ratio of @xmath120 to the geometric mean of the schwarzschild radius @xmath133 and the hubble radius @xmath157 .",
    "the latter is of the order of @xmath158 , so that its geometric mean with a schwarzschild radius of @xmath159 is approximately given by @xmath160 .",
    "the ratio of the effects is therefore of the order @xmath161 .",
    "hence the cosmological contribution is negligible for any application in the solar system as compared to the special - relativistic correction . for the pioneer spacecrafts 10 and 11",
    "we have a radial velocity of about @xmath162 .",
    "this amounts to a special relativistic correction of magnitude @xmath163 times the newtonian gravitational acceleration , in an outwardly pointing direction .",
    "this is of the same order of magnitude as the pioneers anomalous acceleration  @xcite , but pointing in the opposite direction .",
    "it is often heard that effects of cosmological expansion are at most of order @xmath164 .",
    "we have seen in ( [ eq : mcv - newton - eq ] ) that this is true as far as deviations from the newtonian equation of motion are concerned . however , there is a term linear in @xmath153 that enters the formula for the two - way doppler tracking , as seen in ( [ eq : mcvittie - doppler - tracking - geodesic ] ) , even though the correction it gives is negligible as compared with the special relativistic one , due to its suppression with a factor of @xmath74 .",
    "finally we point out that for direct comparison with actual measurements there are other corrections to our doppler formulae that can easily be taken care of .",
    "for example , one needs to incorporate the motion of the earth relative to the cosmological substrate with an additional doppler factor ( [ eq : kinematical - redshift ] ) at the emission and reception points @xmath68 and @xmath70 .",
    "also , one needs to take into account that in the actual tracking procedure signals are sent back with a fixed frequency translation factor ( see e.g.  formula  ( 1 ) in  @xcite ) .",
