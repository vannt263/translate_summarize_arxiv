    "we can reformulate the content of theorem [ sat1 ] by saying that for a sequence @xmath18 with @xmath19 , and for randomly chosen base points @xmath24 , the possible gromov - hausdorff limits of subsequences of @xmath25 are quasi - conformally equivalent to @xmath22 and @xmath23 . to appreciate this statement , notice that for each @xmath26 there are sequences @xmath27 , and @xmath28 with @xmath24 such that @xmath25 converges to @xmath29 where @xmath21 has infinite topology ( see section [ sec : weak ] ) .",
    "the statement of theorem [ sat1 ] is that the choice of this sequence of base points has been extremely biassed .",

    "it is easy to use the whitehead manifold to construct a sequence @xmath7 of manifolds diffeomorphic to @xmath30 , with sectional curvature bounded in absolute value by one , injectivity radius bounded from below , volume growing without bounds , and with distributional limit supported by the set of manifolds with infinite topology ( see section [ sec : weak ] ) .    as always",
    ", knowing something about the gromov - hausdorff limit of a sequence of riemannian manifold translates into knowledge about the members of the sequence .",
    "for instance , we derive from theorem [ sat1 ] :    [ cheeger ] fix @xmath0 and a closed riemannian manifold @xmath1 of dimension @xmath17 . if @xmath18 is a sequence such that @xmath19 , then @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the cheeger constant of @xmath11 .",
    "recall that the cheeger constant of a possibly non - compact riemannian manifold @xmath33 is @xmath34 where the infimum is taken over all decompositions @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 have disjoint interior and @xmath38 .",

    "returning to the setting of theorem [ sat1 ] , recall the assumption that the involved manifolds have at least dimension @xmath41 .",
    "in fact , theorem [ sat1 ] fails in dimension 2 .",
    "for instance , there are sequences @xmath7 of riemannian surfaces conformally equivalent to @xmath42 whose distributional limit @xmath16 satisfies @xmath43 we discuss this example in section [ sec:2dim ] .",
    "the main difference between the 2-dimensional and the higher dimensional case is that in the latter local collapse can not occur .",
    "more concretely , we use the gromov - zorich _ global homeomorphism theorem _ @xcite to prove :    [ no - collapse ] let @xmath1 be a closed riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath17 . for every @xmath0 there is @xmath44 positive such that every @xmath45 with diameter @xmath46 has injectivity radius @xmath47",
    ".    basically , the @xmath46 assumption in theorem [ no - collapse ] rules out that @xmath1 and @xmath3 are homothetic flat tori with @xmath48 very small .",

    "notice also that theorem [ no - collapse ] implies that the subset of @xmath2 consisting of manifolds with volume at most @xmath49 is compact .",
    "this justifies the assumption in theorem [ sat1 ] and theorem [ cheeger ] that the volume of the involved manifolds grows without bounds .",
    "as we mentioned above , the failure of theorem [ sat1 ] for surfaces is related to the lack of uniform bounds for the injectivity radius .",
    "in fact , theorem [ sat1 ] holds in the 2-dimensional situation as long as we assume such a uniform bound .",
    "moreover , in that situation we can use the uniformization theorem to prove a version of theorem [ sat1 ] for sequences of surfaces with slow genus growth :    [ sat12 ] suppose that @xmath7 is a sequence of closed riemannian surfaces with @xmath50 for all @xmath9 .",

    "@xmath16 is supported by rooted graphs with vanishing cheeger constant @xmath63 and recurrent simple random walk .    as is the case for manifolds , knowing something about the possible limits of the sequence @xmath57",
    "allows us to derive information about the members of the sequence .",
    "for example , recall that an _ expander _ is a sequence @xmath57 of graphs with uniformly bounded valence such that @xmath64 it follows from ( * ? ? ? * theorem 4 ) that every expander has linear genus growth . from theorem [ genusgbs ]",
    "we obtain a new proof of this fact :    [ expanders ] for every expander @xmath57 there is a positive constant @xmath65 with @xmath66 for all @xmath9 .",
    "we describe briefly the strategy of the proof of our main result , theorem [ sat1 ] . by theorem [ no - collapse ]",
    "we may assume without loss of generality that all the manifolds @xmath7 have injectivity radius at least @xmath67 .",
    "fix a @xmath5-quasi - conformal map @xmath68 for all @xmath9 and choose a maximal 1-net @xmath69 .",
    "we observe that for all @xmath70 and for most @xmath71 the image @xmath72 of the ball around @xmath24 of radius @xmath73 has very small diameter .",
    "this implies that the scaled manifolds @xmath74 converge in the pointed gromov - hausdorff topology to @xmath75 .",
    "compactness of quasi - conformal maps implies now that the maps @xmath76 converge to a quasi - conformal map @xmath77 where @xmath29 is the gromov - hausdorff limit of the sequence @xmath25 .",
    "denoting by @xmath78 the limit of the nets @xmath69 we observe that either @xmath79 consists of at most a single point or @xmath80 has at least 2 accumulation points .",
    "a variant of a lemma due to benjamini and schramm @xcite implies that this last situation does not happen if we take the points @xmath71 at random .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sections [ sec - preli ] and [ sec : quasi ] we discuss mostly well - known facts on gromov - hausdorff limits , distributional limits and quasi - conformal maps . in section [ sec : no - collapse ] we prove theorem [ no - collapse ] . in section [ sec : bs ] we obtain two rather simpleminded manifold versions of the key lemma in @xcite .",
