    "the tiling 2f   is related to the primitive tiling  @xcite by converting only the tetrahedra @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) into acute and obtuse rhombohedra , respectively .",

    "we start with a description of the window in  for the tiling 2f  and its coding content .",
    "the window for the tiling is a triacontahedron .",
    "our aim is to look for a possible coding of the planes orthogonal to a 5fold direction of an icosahedron , that appear as a fibonacci sequence on mutual distances as observed in the experiment  @xcite .",
    "these planes should contain the quasilattice points of 2f .",
    "with respect to a fixed 5fold axis , we slice the triacontahedron into ten perpendicular zones of five types ( 1 , 2 , ...",

    "this fact has been denoted as the dissectability of the 2f  into planar subtilings 4  @xcite .",
    "the thickness @xmath23 of the zone 1 ( the decagonal prism ) allows , as a necessary condition , for coding a fibonacci sequence of planes with mutual distances in  @xmath24  and @xmath25    @xmath26 ,    where @xmath23 is to be understood as a window  @xcite .",
    "the thicknesses for the unions of the zones @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 scale this window by up to three powers of @xmath30 .",
    "consequently they may code the fibonacci sequences of planes in  three times inflated , respectively .",
    "the final sequence consists of mutual distances @xmath31  and @xmath32 .",
    "+ the significance of the zones in the tiling is related to their content of windows for geometric objects other than quasilattice points : the 1d edges of the tiling have as windows the perpendicular projections of dual 5boundaries , and the faces of the tiling the perpendicular projections of dual 4boundaries .",
    "we consider the edges and the faces of the tiling 2f  in the planes perpendicular to a fixed direction of a 5fold axes .",
    "they are coded by the corresponding dual boundaries related to the same 5fold axes in . in these planes there can appear only two of four kinds of faces of the tiling , the golden triangles @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "they are equilateral triangles with one edge @xmath30   and two edges  , and one edge  and two edges @xmath30  , respectively .",

    "all the points of these projected dual boundaries , related to the particular 5fold direction , are located within the triacontahedron and moreover inside the union @xmath41 and not in the zone @xmath42 . from their intersections with the first decagonal prism we get the full coding for the triangle pattern 4  in . for the zones @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 outside the decagonal prism we expect in  a gradual reduction in the density of triangle faces and edges , due to the disappearance of their coding in the zones .",
    "we also expect qualitative differences in the pattern in the planes of different types .",
    "finally in the zone @xmath42 we expect no such triangles and edges .",
    "these reductions should go along with a reduction of the density of quasilattice points for the tiling 2f .    here",
    "we do not prove the sufficient condition for the existence of fibonacci sequences of planes . in ref .",
    "@xcite we identify the vectors which generate this fibonacci sequence .",
    "instead we check our expectations based on the necessary conditions from the side of the window on the finite patch in  obtained by the inflation procedure for the tiling 2f  @xcite .",
    "we inspect a 10step inflation patch .",
    "we cut the patch of 2f  in  by planes orthogonal to the 5fold direction whenever there is a quasilattice point .",
    "there appear 318 planes on three mutual distances : @xmath46  , @xmath47  and @xmath48  .",
    "the patch construction will allow us to simulate in detail the planar structure and its sequence and to compare it with experimental findings  @xcite .",
    "at the same time we wish to keep track of the coding window structure described above .",
    "for this purpose we pass to  by the unique procedure of lifting the quasilattice points of the patch into the triacontahedral window .",
    "the points within each plane of perpendicular to a 5fold axis are lifted into an intersection of the triacontahedron with a plane shifted along and perpendicular to the corresponding 5axis in . from the shift ( with respect to the center of all the points of the patch )",
    "we assign to each plane one of the ten zones @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 of the triacontahedron introduced before . in the generated patch there",
    "appear 5 families of planes in , corresponding to the ten zones of 5 types in : the decagonal prism yields the densest planes with the golden triangle tiling .",
    "the zones 2 , 3 and 4 give planes still containing golden triangles ( and edges ) of the triangle tiling .",
    "in contrast , the planes in   of the type 5 in  contain only points of the quasilattice but neither edges nor faces ( see figure  7 ) .    in the patch",
    ", there are 234 planes of the types @xmath29 and they do appear in a fibonacci sequence with a short @xmath54 and a long @xmath55 spacing . as expected @xmath56  , @xmath57 ; @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the thickness of the window for the fibonacci spacing .",
    "also the types @xmath28 , @xmath27 and @xmath60 appear in corresponding by @xmath30 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , respectively , inflated fibonacci sequences .",
    "finally the planes of type 5 are not part of the fibonacci sequence , and lead to the three distances among the planes of _ all _ types , @xmath46  , @xmath47  and @xmath48  . the planes of type 5 carry a low density of quasilattice points .    in the katz  gratias",
    " de  boissieu  elser model the scale is @xmath30times bigger than in 2f  @xcite .",
    "the short edge has the length @xmath30   and the long edge @xmath61  . for i ",
    "alpdmn , the standard length is  @xmath63  @xcite . inserting it into the model the two spacings of the planes @xmath29 become @xmath64  @xmath65 and @xmath66  @xmath67  , in agreement with the measured step heights  @xcite .      in the 10 times",
    "inflated patch we find 20 sequences of 11 planes such that each sequence could correspond to the observed 11 terraces in the experiment  @xcite on the distances h h l h h l h l h h , see figure  1 .",
    "let us take one of these sequences , the one from 182197 and plot it along the sequence determined by the experiment , figure  8 .",
    "in the sequence 182197 there are 5 planes of type 5 that are not observed in the measurement . the biggest terrace observed in the experiment , denoted by no .",
    "8  @xcite appears to correspond to the plane no .",
    "192 of type 3 in the sequence . in our 20 sequences , on the position of the plane no",
    ".  8 there appears 16 times the plane of type 3 , coded in the zone @xmath68 , and 4 times of type 2 , coded in the zone @xmath69 .",
    "for all 20 sequences the first plane is of type 4 , coded in the zone @xmath70 by the interval ( @xmath71 , @xmath72)@xmath73 .",
    "the whole zone @xmath70 is coded by the interval ( @xmath74,@xmath75)@xmath76 . the coding interval of the plane equivalent to terrace no .  8 is @xmath77 ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 ) .",
    "so far we considered the points , edges and faces of the tiling in the sequence of planes orthogonal to a 5fold direction .",
    "now we turn to the decoration by the bergman clusters , as suggested by elser  @xcite .",
    "the decoration of the tiling 2f  by the bergman polytopes is performed as stated in section  [ geom1 ] and ref .  @xcite . as a final result , related to the planes of type 15 orthogonal to a 5fold axes",
    ", there appear _ layers _ of bergman polytopes .",
    "the edge of the bergman polytope ( dodecahedron ) is @xmath80  @xmath81 and consequently the height of the dodecahedron , and the layers , is @xmath82  @xmath67 .",
    "it equals the high spacing of the fibonacci planes of type 14 , @xmath83 .    in figure  9",
    "all layers of bergman polytopes with two opposite pentagonal faces orthogonal to a 5fold direction ( z  axis ) in a part of the 10step inflation patch are presented .",
    "the part of the patch contains the planes no .  177197 , such that it includes the 11 planes from figure  8 .",
    "the length of horizontal lines in the rows ( b1 ) , ( b2 ) , ( b3 ) represents the height of a bergman dodecahedron , and their horizontal positions give the positions with respect to quasilattice planes .",
    "horizontal lines to the right of a quasilattice plane denote bergman polytopes hanging below the plane , horizontal lines to the left are bergman polytopes standing on the plane .    in particular , ( b1 )",
    "are the layers of bergman polytopes such that they are in between the planes of type @xmath84 , hanging from one plane and standing on another .",
    "( b2 ) are the layers of bergman polytopes hanging from some of the planes of type @xmath84 and eventually standing on a plane of type 5 .",
    "( b3 ) are the layers of bergman polytopes standing on some of the planes of type @xmath84 and eventually hanging on a plane of type 5 . hence the latter can not be interpreted as situated below any of the planes of type @xmath84 .",
    "the densities of all the layers , @xmath85 ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) are written in the figure  9 under the horizontal lines representing bergman layers , see also table 1 .",
    "the layers of bergman polytopes are `` geared '' to each other .",
    "if we wish to interpret the observed terraces as the planes of the type 14 and consider the bergman polytopes as the clusters  @xcite , then we relate to each terrace ( plane ) the layer of the bergman polytopes _ below _ the plane , i.e. the layer of hanging bergman clusters .",
    "these clusters touch with a pentagonal face a plane of quasilattice points from below .",
    "if that happens , the atomic position at the midpoint of the face is lowered with respect to the plane by @xmath88 , occupied by al in the @xmath89 position of the model  @xcite .",
    "this face could appear as a dark hole in the stm experiment .",
    "the search for these pentagonal faces within the planes of type 14 is equivalent to the search for those bergman clusters which hang below these planes ( from the layers b1 and b2 ) . knowing the coding interval in the window for the terrace no .  8 , @xmath77 ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 ) , one can , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , compute the density of the corresponding hanging bergman polytope layer .    using this approach",
    "we find the density of the terrace no .",
    "8 to be in the range of 5.728.62 @xmath90 hanging bergman clusters / @xmath91 .",
    "as we already stated , the planes of type 14 are by their mutual distances in agreement with the terraces observed by stm  @xcite .",
    "the planes of type 5 are not observed as terraces , probably due to the low densities of the quasilattice points in the planes .",
    "how is the appearance of the terraces related to the bergman layers ? planes ( terraces ) appear to be correlated to 3 bergman layers such that one layer is above the plane , another below the plane and the third one is dissected by the plane .",
    "these planes are of type 14 . for planes",
    "which appear correlated to only 2 bergman layers such that w.r.t .",
    "the previous case either the layer above or below the plane is missing , do not appear .",
    "these planes are of type 5 .    .",

    "planes coded by the decagonal prism in triacontahedron .",
    "the symbol @xmath94 is the normalized @xmath95coordinate in , @xmath96 ) , the coordinate of the plane  coding in the window for 2f , @xmath97 . @xmath86 and @xmath87 are respectively the densities of the bergman",

    "in this paper we have used the projection ",
    "tools related to the tiling 2f .",
    "we have refined the already known dissectability property  @xcite of the tiling 2f   along the 5fold direction and have transfered this inherent property of the tiling into the layer structure of katz  gratias  de  boissieu  elser model .",
    "in addition , we have generated a huge patch of the tiling 2f  by a highly non ",
    "trivial inflation procedure  @xcite to linear dimensions of about 750  .",
    "it is large enough to reproduce all statistical predictions about densities from the projection method as well as to contain inflation symmetries ( 10@xmath5 step of the inflation ) .",
    "we do not consider the choice of the katz ",
    "de  boissieu  elser model as a significant restriction because most of the results derived above will also hold for models with approximately the same size of windows , as for example the model from janot  @xcite that we have not yet considered .",
    "we have focused on the katz  gratias  de  boissieu  elser model because it is defined as a decoration of the tiling ( primitive , or 2f ) and all powerful tools known from the projection methods are applicable .",
    "we prove that the experimentally observed succession of the step heights l ( low ) and h ( high ) along the 5fold axis ( z  direction ) , which obeys the fibonacci sequence , also exists in the patch of the geometric katz ",
    "de  boissieu  elser model .",
    "additionally , we relate this sequence to another fibonacci sequence of the distances n ( narrow ) and w ( wide ) between lines within the planes ( x  y planes ) of the terraces also found in experiments  @xcite .    the estimated coding of the observed finite fibonacci subsequence along the 5fold direction restricts the choice of planes in the model which have to be compared with the experimentally analysed terraces .",
    "our model predicts big variations of the densities of quasilattice points ( or equivalently pentagonal holes ) among terraces which should be measurable in future high  quality stm images .",
    "our analysis shows that the katz  gratias ",
    "de  boissieu  elser model can be understood as being composed of `` geared '' layer of bergman polytopes ( figure 9 ) .",
    "we relate sequences of these layers of bergman polytopes to the observed terraces and derive the patterns of pentagons within the terraces .",
    "we calculate the densities of bergman clusters ( table 1 ) within the layers based on the knowledge of the window for the bergman clusters  @xcite as well as using our huge patch ( figure 9 ) . the calculated pentagon distribution yields a reasonable mean density and good agreement of the patterson data ( figure 13 , table 2 ) .",
    "the direct space patterns even reproduce some structures ( white 5stars ) observed on the surface of the terraces .",
    "other features of the patterns ( figures 11 and 12 ) should be observable in future high - quality stm images .",
    "hence , we predict more detailed criteria to judge from stm data whether the katz  gratias",
    " de  boissieu  elser model is realized or not .    if we assume that the surface of i ",
    "alpdmn is not reconstructed w.r.t .",
    "the bulk , a fact that follows from the work of gierer et al .",
    "@xcite , then the bergman polytopes represent a correct geometric decoration , but they may not be considered as energetically stable clusters .",
    "this follows from the picture of `` geared '' layers of bergman polytopes presented in figure 9 which requires that bergman clusters are cut in order to allow for the observed step heights ( h and l ) .",
    "further , from the alternating decoration with bergman and mackay polytopes of the primitive tiling  @xcite one can also easily conclude that the same model can not be interpreted as the mackay  cluster model either .",
    "therefore , the bergman and mackay clusters have to be considered as geometric building blocks of the quasicrystalline structure rather than as energetically stable entities .",
