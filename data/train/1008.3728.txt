    "high - velocity outflows from quasars appear to be a natural part of the accretion process .",

    "these narrower outflow lines are more common than bals @xcite .",

    "quasar outflows have gained attention recently as a mechanism that can physically couple quasars to the evolution of their host galaxies .",

    "the kinetic energy luminosity , @xmath11 , needed for significant feedback from a quasar outflow is believed to be just a few percent of the quasar bolometric ( photon ) luminosity , e.g. , @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , many aspects of the energetics and physical properties of quasar outflows remain poorly understood .",
    "computational models aimed mainly at bals attribute the flows to gas lifted off of the accretion disk and driven outward to high speeds by radiation pressure or magneto - centrifugal forces @xcite .",
    "radiative forces are expected to dominate in quasars , where the bolometric luminosities are a substantial fraction of the eddington luminosity @xcite .",
    "one essential requirement for radiative driving is that the outflow is not too highly ionized , so it can maintain significant line and bound - free continuum opacities across the main acceleration region .",
    "this is not trivial for flows launched from the inner accretion disk , near the quasar s intense source of ionizing radiation .",
    "@xcite proposed that the outflow ionization is moderated by a high column density of roughly stationary material that serves as a radiative shield at the base of the flow ( also * ? ? ?",
    "the shielding medium is itself too ionized and too transparent to be driven radiatively to high speeds , but it might have enough continuous opacity in the far - uv and x - rays to lower the ionization and thereby facilitate the acceleration of the gas directly behind it ( i.e. , farther from the emission source ) .",
    "this scenario is supported by observations showing that bal quasars are heavily obscured in x - rays , consistent with strong radiative shielding @xcite . however ,",
    "other observations indicate that quasars with nal or mini - bal outflows have substantially less x - ray absorption @xcite .",
    "this disparity in the x - ray results , between bals on the one hand and nals and mini - bals on the other , presents an important challenge to the paradigm of radiative acceleration behind an x - ray / far - uv shield ( see also  4.5 below ) .    a central problem is our poor understanding of the physical relationships between bal , nal and mini - bal outflows .",
    "one possibility is that the different line types are simply different manifestations of a single outflow phenomenon viewed at different angles . for example",
    ", it is often supposed that bals form in the main body of the outflow near the accretion disk plane , while nals and mini - bals form along sightlines that skim the edges of the bal flow at higher latitudes above the disk @xcite .",
    "there could also be evolutionary effects .",
    "for example , nals and mini - bals might represent the tentative beginning or end stages of a more powerful bal outflow phase @xcite .",
    "there is some evidence for outflow evolution in that a particular variety of low - ionization bals ( the so - called felobals ) is found preferentially in dusty young host galaxies with high star formation rates @xcite .",
    "variability studies have shown further that bals and mini - bals in quasar spectra can appear , disappear or swap identities ( where a bal becomes a mini - bal or vice versa ) on time scales of months to years in the quasar rest frame @xcite .",
    "the true relationship between outflow nals , bals and mini - bals probably involves an amalgam of orientation and time - dependent effects .    to build a more complete picture of quasar outflows ,",
    "we need better observational constraints on the physical properties of each outflow type .",
    "nal outflows present a unique challenge because they are difficult to identify .",
    "most narrow absorption lines in quasar spectra form in cosmologically intervening gas that has no relationship to the background quasar .",
    "statistical studies that examine the velocity distributions of the narrow metal lines @xcite , or correlations between the incidence of these lines and the properties of the background quasars @xcite , indicate that significant fractions of the narrow metal - line systems do arise in quasar outflows .",
    "however , to identify individual nal outflow systems we need more information .",
    "the most commonly used indicators of an outflow origin are line variability , resolved absorption profiles that are significantly broad and smooth compared to thermal line widths , or line strength ratios in multiplets that reveal partial line - of - sight covering of the background light source @xcite .    here",

    "the situation is further complicated by the fact that the background light sources , e.g. , the accretion disk and/or the belr , have their own spatial non - uniformities that can include a wavelength - dependent size .",
    "a good strategy , therefore , is to consider the observational consequences of different plausible @xmath38 spatial distributions @xcite . in one study , extensive simulations using different functional forms for the @xmath38 spatial distribution show that equation 1 ( which assumes a top hat @xmath38 distribution ) yields good approximations to the spatially - averaged values of @xmath38 and @xmath31 in more general inhomogeneous absorbing media @xcite .",

    "the partial covering discussed in  3.3 implies that the absorbing structures are not much larger than the background light source .",
    "( the absorbers could be smaller than the emission source , but partial covering by much larger clouds would require unphysically sharp edges and extremely unlikely spatial alignments . )",
    "figure 2 shows that the variable  systems lie in the far blue wing of the  bel , where the flux is dominated by continuum emission . in principle",
    ", the line absorption could occur in front of both the uv continuum source and the belr , with potentially different covering fractions for each region @xcite .",
    "however , the depths of the lines below the quasar continuum ( figure 2 ) imply that the  partial covering results pertain mostly or exclusively to the continuum source .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by the  lines , which have even deeper absorption troughs and no significant underlying belr flux .    the extent to which the absorbers cover the belr are thus undetermined by our data .",
    "this ambiguity introduces a small additional uncertainty in @xmath39 derived for the  lines because the belr contributes roughly 10% of the total flux at those wavelengths ( figure 2 ) . our analysis in  3.3 assumed implicitly that @xmath39 is the same for all emission sources beneath the absorption lines .",
    "however , if the belr is not covered at all , the continuum covering fractions would be roughly 10% larger than the values listed for  in table 3 .",
    "conversely , if the  absorber completely covers the belr , the continuum covering fractions would be @xmath820% smaller than the results listed in table 3 ( see equations in * ? ? ?",
    "this latter situation ( complete coverage of the belr with partial covering of the continuum source ) seems highly unlikely given that the  belr is of order 20 times larger than the continuum source at 1550   (  2.1 ) .",
    "hereafter , we will assume that all of the derived covering fractions apply only to the continuum source .",
    "comparing the covering fractions in  and   ( tables 3 and 4 ) to the theoretical diameters of the continuum source at 1550   and 1034  , respectively (  2.1 ) , indicates that the  and  absorbing regions both have characteristic sizes of order @xmath80.01 - 0.02 pc ( as measured in 2006.64 ) .",
    "it is important to keep in mind , however , that this characteristic size is actually just an upper limit on the true sizes of absorbing structures in the flow .",
    "in particular , partial covering might be caused by patchy distributions of many smaller sub - structures ( see  4.4 below , also * ? ? ?",
    "the five distinct outflow systems span a range of velocities from @xmath09710 to @xmath014,050 km s@xmath1  and  line widths from fwhm @xmath3 62 to 164 km s@xmath1  ( table 2 ) .",
    "the  lines , representing higher ionization material , appear somewhat broader than  in terms of both their fwhms and broad weak wings ( see figs . 4 and 5 ) .",
    "the outflow systems have a natural division into two groups , a+b+c and d+e , based on similarities in the line strengths , profiles and velocity shifts ( see also fig .",
    "one remarkable characteristic of these systems overall is their small velocity dispersions compared to the high flow speeds , e.g. , fwhm/@xmath61 .",
    "this in marked contrast to bal outflows , which typically have fwhm/@xmath62 @xcite .",
    "the kinematic stability of the narrowest systems a , b and c between 2006.64 and 2008.67 places an upper limit on the radial acceleration of @xmath53 km s@xmath1  yr@xmath1 in the quasar frame .",
    "we obtain this estimate from the measurements in table 3 and by careful comparisons of simultaneous fits to all three narrow systems ( in  and ) in both epochs .",

    "therefore , the outward driving force is either in a delicate balance with gravity or , more likely , the absorbing gas is located in a low - gravity environment farther from the black hole than the   belr . a radial distance of @xmath64 pc is needed for the local gravity to be less than the observed acceleration limit . at this distance",
    ", the observed outflow speeds vastly exceed the local gravitational escape speed .",
    "thus it appears that the absorbing gas is gravitationally unbound and coasting freely at speeds near the outflow terminal velocity .",
    "there is an apparent occurrence of  line - locking \" between the narrow  systems a , b and c. in particular , the velocity differences between systems a - b and b - c are a close match to the  doublet separation of @xmath65 km s@xmath1 .",
    "( although the system b lines are entirely blended in , their velocity is confirmed by our fits to the   lines shown in figure 4 . )",
    "line - locking is usually interpreted as evidence for radiative acceleration @xcite .",
    "cases of multiple line - locks between systems with narrow profiles , as in j2123 - 0050 , provide the best evidence for physically locked systems because they are difficult to explain by chance alignments of lines in the spectrum .",
    "however , it is not known if radiative forces can actually lock doublets like  together in real quasar outflows .",
    "the most plausible scenario was outlined by @xcite : consider two blobs of gas moving along the same radial path in a radiatively accelerated outflow .",
    "the faster blob is farther from the emission source and experiencing a _",
    "greater _ outward acceleration .",
    "when the velocity difference between the blobs matches the   doublet separation , @xmath66 km s@xmath1 , the @xmath21551 line in the outer blob falls in the shadow cast by @xmath21548 in the slower inner blob .",
    "this leads to diminished acceleration in the outer blob and a velocity lock between the two blobs at the doublet separation .",
    "line - locking might even contribute to the formation of blobs because the localized dip in the radiative force downstream from the inner blob creates a natural collecting area for outflow gas @xcite .",
    "this scenario does not require that the  lines dominate the overall acceleration , only that the acceleration transferred to the outer blob via the @xmath21551 line is at least as large as the acceleration _ difference _ between the two blobs in the absence of shadowing ( i.e. , outside of the @xmath66 km s@xmath1   line overlap situation ) .",
    "the appearance of a double line - lock in , as in j2123 - 0050 , might also be facilitated by the  absorption doublet whose separation , @xmath67",
    "km s@xmath1 , is close to the velocity difference between systems a and c. in any case , the feasibility of this line - lock interpretation has not been demonstrated in any quasar outflow .    here",
    "we note simply that if radiative forces did indeed lock the   doublets in j2123 - 0050 , then the absorbing clouds must be moving almost directly toward us .",
    "this is because the velocity difference between line - locked blobs should match the  doublet separation along the flow direction .",
    "if the flow is not aimed directly at us , we should observe velocity differences between the systems that are smaller than the doublet separation .",
    "our measurements of the line centroids ( table 2 ) and our fits to the profiles , including  in system b ( table 3 and figure 4 ) , indicate that the velocity differences between systems a , b and c are within @xmath820 km s@xmath1  of @xmath65 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this implies that the absorber trajectories are within @xmath816@xmath9 of the purely radial ( line - of - sight ) direction .",
    "the strong detections of  compared to  absorption , and the non - detections of lower ionization lines like  and  ( tables 3 and 4 ) , indicate that the degree of ionization is high and approximately the same in all of the variable systems .",
    "the appendix below describes numerical simulations using the code cloudy @xcite of the ionization and physical conditions in clouds that are in photoionization equilibrium with a quasar continuum source . comparing those results ( figure a1 ) to the most stringent limit on the observed @xmath68 column density ratio ( system c in 2006.64 )",
    "indicates that the dimensionless ionization parameter is at least @xmath69 .",

    "the outflow systems are , in fact , surrounded in the j2123 - 0050 spectrum by other narrow  lines that did not vary , do not have partial covering and almost certainly do form in unrelated intervening material ( figure 1 ) .",
    "one of these intervening systems is at a smaller velocity shift than the outflow lines ( at @xmath102 km s@xmath1 ) , while another is blended directly with the outflow system e ( see also table 2 and figure 5 ) .",

    "the secure outflow origin of the nals in j2123 - 0050 lends anecdotal support to recent claims that a significant fraction of narrow  systems , even at large velocity shifts , form in quasar outflows .",

    "this explanation is , in fact , favored by some recent studies of bal variability @xcite .",

    "this seems unrealistic given that the radial flow speeds are not much larger , e.g. , @xmath97 to 14,050 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the maximum transverse speeds we might expect in a quasar outflow launched from a rotating accretion disk are of order the virial speed at the absorber location .",
    "a virial speed consistent with @xmath111 km s@xmath1  in j2123 - 0050 would require that the absorber resides at a radial distance @xmath52.4 pc from the smbh .",
    "this would place the absorbers inside of the minimum radius of 5 pc estimated above from the lack of radial acceleration (  3.5 ) .",
    "it would also contradict the evidence from line - locking that the flow we observe is traveling primarily in a radial direction (  3.5 ) .",
    "a more likely explanation for the coordinated line variations is global changes in the ionization caused by fluctuations in the quasar s continuum flux .",
    "this situation could produce the observed changes in the covering fractions (  3.3 ) if the absorbers are spatially inhomogeneous , i.e. , with a distribution of column densities across the emission source , such that the projected areas with @xmath112 in a given line change with the ionization state of the gas @xcite .",
    "the observed decrease in the  line strengths between 2006.64 and 2008.67 , accompanied by smaller or negligible changes in , are consistent with an overall increase in the ionization parameter if the starting point was near the peak in the  ion fraction .",
    "in particular , an ionization parameter initially near @xmath74 in 2006.64 and then increasing by a few tenths of a dex by 2008.67 would cause a decline in the  line strengths and column densities consistent with the observations ( table 3 ) , while the  remains nearly constant ( see figure a1 ) .",
    "this scenario requires that the quasar s far - uv continuum flux changed by a factor of roughly two in @xmath40.63 yr ( rest ) .",
    "little is known about the far - uv variability properties of luminous quasars .",

    "moreover , the @xmath113-band flux increased by this amount between roughly 2005.8 and the last stripe 82 data point in 2008.0 , which is consistent with an our conclusion that the ionization increased between the keck and vlt observations in 2006.64 and 2008.67 .",
    "the main caveat to interpreting the nal variabilities in terms far - uv flux changes is that there _ might _ have been a large nal variation between 2006.64 ( keck ) and 2006.71 ( mmt ) , i.e. , in just @xmath88 days in the quasar frame ( figure 3 ) .",
    "if this extreme short - term variability can be confirmed , it might be difficult to explain via factor of @xmath82 changes in the far - uv emission from the accretion disk ( but see also * ? ? ?",
    "the outflow nals in j2123 - 005 require at least five distinct absorbing structures that have similar physical conditions ( ionization , column densities , covering fractions ,  3.3 and  3.4 ) and roughly similar kinematics ( lines dispersions and velocity shifts ,  3.5 ) .",
    "the partial covering evident in all five systems indicates that the absorbers are each characteristically smaller than the quasar s uv continuum source , e.g. , @xmath80.01 - 0.02 pc across .",
    "all five absorbers must also be spatially inhomogeneous to explain the observed changes in the covering fractions if those changes are , indeed , caused by changes in the quasar s ionizing flux (  4.3 ) .",
    "the absorbing structures might be discrete blobs or filaments created by instabilities in the inner flow , perhaps resembling the clumpy structures seen in some numerical simulations of bal winds @xcite .",
    "if this assessment is correct , then their most likely location is near the minimum radius of @xmath114 pc inferred from the lack of acceleration (  3.5 ) .",
    "this is because small blobs or filaments have short survival times against dissipation if there is no external pressure confinement .",
    "the characteristic absorber diameter of @xmath115 pc (  3.4 ) combined with the doppler parameters @xmath116 km s@xmath1  of the broader systems d and e ( table 3 ) indicate dissipation times of order @xmath117 yr .",
    "this is much longer than our observation timeline ( table 1 ) and therefore not a factor in the line variability . however , gas blobs moving radially at @xmath118 km s@xmath1  ( for systems d and e ) will travel a distance of just @xmath83 pc before dissipating .",
    "therefore , they should be located within @xmath83 pc of their point of origin . if that was the inner flow near the accretion disk ( e.g. , at radii not much greater than a few times @xmath119 pc ,  2.1 , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , then the absorbers should reside near the @xmath114 pc minimum radius (  4.1 ) .",
    "one puzzling constraint on the internal structure of these absorbers comes from the high densities . at @xmath114 pc ,",
    "the densities need to be near the upper end of the estimated range , @xmath120 @xmath79 , to avoid over - ionization by the intense quasar radiation field (  3.6 ) .",
    "however , this entire density range is much larger than the average gas density , @xmath121 @xmath79 , expected for absorbing clouds with total column density @xmath122 @xmath37  (  3.6 ) and characteristic size @xmath80.015 pc .",
    "this disparity implies that each of the five absorbers is composed of dense sheets or sub - structures that have radial thickness much smaller than their characteristic _ transverse _ size of @xmath80.015 pc .",
    "the combined radial thickness of these sheets or sub - structures in each absorbing region is just @xmath123 cm if they are at @xmath114 pc , or @xmath8@xmath124 cm at @xmath125 pc .",
    "some early studies of bals presented similar arguments for the existence of dense sub - structures with an overall small volume filling factor in quasar outflows @xcite .",
    "those studies also recognized that the creation and survival of such small sub - structures present a serious theoretical challenge for outflow models @xcite .",
    "these concerns about sub - structure effectively ended when @xcite and @xcite proposed an attractive alternative , namely , that the flows could be spatially smooth and continuous if there is a shielding medium at the base of the flow that blocks most of the quasar s intense x - ray and far - uv radiation . with this shielding medium in place , the outflow gas behind the shield should be able to maintain the observed moderate degrees of ionization at much lower gas densities , thus allowing the flow to have an overall smooth spatial distribution .",
    "subsequent x - ray observations supported this scenario by showing that bal quasars are heavily absorbed in x - rays @xcite .",
    "however , j2123 - 0050 , like other nal and mini - bal outflow quasars , does not have strong x - ray absorption (  1 and  2.2 ) and therefore it does not have a significant x - ray / far - uv shield ( see also the calculations in * ? ? ?",
    "small dense sub - structures do appear necessary to explain the moderate degree of ionization at the inferred flow locations .",
    "thus the debate about the existence of small sub - structures in quasar outflows remains open .",

    "the most remarkable aspect of the nal outflow in j2123 - 0050 is the degree to which it contrasts with bal flows .",
    "for example , it has high speeds and ionizations very similar to bals , but the nals we measure are about a hundred times narrower and a hundred times weaker ( in rew ) than typical bals ( c.f . ,",

    "our estimate of the total column density , @xmath126 @xmath37 , is also 1 - 2 orders of magnitude less than the best available estimates obtained from bals @xcite .",
    "the weak or absent x - ray absorption in j2123 - 0050 @xcite is typical of other nal and mini - bal outflow sources @xcite , but it too is very different from the strong x - ray absorption found in bal quasars @xcite .",
    "this disparity in the x - ray properties between bal , mini - bal and nal outflows has important implications for outflow physics . as noted in  4.4",
    ", the prevailing models of radiatively - driven bal outflows have a shielding medium at the base of the flow that can absorb the quasar s ionizing far - uv / x - ray flux and thus prevent the over - ionization of the outflow gas behind the shield @xcite .",
    "moderate ionizations in the outflow gas are essential to maintain significant opacities and facilitate the radiative acceleration to high speeds . however , the absence of strong x - ray absorption in j2123 - 0050 shows that high speeds and moderate ionizations can occur in quasar outflows _ without _ significant radiative shielding .",
    "one way to reconcile these results is by a unified scheme where the outflows measured via bals , nals and mini - bals coexist at different spatial locations . in situations like this ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the acceleration of the nal and mini - bal gas might occur in the shielded bal environment ( near the accretion disk plane ) before it moves to its observed location ( farther above the disk ) where the shielding is negligible .",
    "the discrete appearance of nals and mini - bals in quasra spectra might be due to their formation in discrete blobs or filaments that are created via instabilities along the ragged edge of the main bal outflow @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear there can be enough vertical force to push these blobs significantly away from the disk plane and out of their natural radial trajectories away from the uv continuum source .",
    "a more basic problem with this picture is that nals and mini - bals have degrees of ionization similar to bals even though they are not behind the radiative shield that is alleged to be important for controlling the outflow ionization . if the nal and mini - bal gas is accelerated in a shielded bal environment where it has moderate bal - like ionizations , how does it maintain those moderate bal - like ionizations after it emerges from the shielded bal zone ?",
    "the obvious answer from our analysis of j2123 - 0050 (  3.6 and  4.4 ) is that the outflow ionization is regulated mostly by locally high gas densities and not by a radiative shield .",
    "high densities could keep the ionization low enough for radiative acceleration even if there is no shielding at all .",
    "perhaps this is the case generally in quasar outflows , including the bals .",
    "however , high densities also lead to the uncomfortable conclusion that the outflows are composed of small sub - structures that have an overall small volume filling factor (  4.4 ) .",
    "the physical processes that might create or maintain these sub - structures are not understood @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the evidence for their existence in j2123 - 0050 is at least consistent with high densities playing a more important role in the acceleration physics than radiative shielding .",

    "thus the full range of plausible distances is @xmath7 pc .",

    "these densities are much larger than the average value @xmath121 @xmath79  expected from the total column density and characteristic size .",

    "<S> five distinct outflow systems are detected with velocity shifts from @xmath09710 to @xmath014,050 km s@xmath1  and  @xmath2@xmath21548,1551 line widths of fwhm @xmath3 62 to 164 km s@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this outflow is remarkable for having high speeds and a degree of ionization similar to broad absorption line ( bal ) flows , but line widths roughly 100 times narrower than bals and no apparent x - ray absorption . </S>",
    "<S> this is also , to our knowledge , the highest - velocity narrow absorption line system confirmed to be in a quasar outflow by all three indicators of line variability , smooth super - thermal line profiles and doublet ratios that require partial covering of the quasar continuum source . </S>",
    "<S> all five systems have stronger absorption in  @xmath2@xmath21032,1038 than  with no lower ionization metal lines detected . </S>",
    "<S> their line variabilities also appear coordinated , with each system showing larger changes in   than  and line strength variations accompanied by nearly commensurate changes in the absorber covering fractions . </S>",
    "<S> the metallicity is approximately twice solar .    </S>",
    "<S> these data require five distinct outflow structures with similar kinematics , physical conditions and characteristic sizes of order 0.01 - 0.02 pc ( based on partial covering ) . </S>",
    "<S> the coordinated line variations , occurring on time scales @xmath40.63 yr ( quasar frame ) , are best explained by global changes in the outflow ionization caused by changes in the quasar s ionizing flux </S>",
    "<S> . an upper limit on the acceleration , @xmath53 km s@xmath1  yr@xmath1 , is consistent with blobs of gas that are gravitationally unbound and coasting freely @xmath65 pc from the central black hole . </S>",
    "<S> additional constraints from the variability time indicate that the full range of plausible distances is @xmath7 pc . </S>",
    "<S> however , if these small absorbing structures were created in the inner flow , they should be near the @xmath85 pc minimum radius because they can travel just a few pc before dissipating ( without external confinement ) . </S>",
    "<S> an apparent double line - lock in  suggests that the flow was radiatively accelerated and its present trajectory is within @xmath816@xmath9 of the radial ( line - of - sight ) direction . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of strong x - ray absorption shows that radiative shielding in the far - uv and x - rays is not needed to maintain moderate bal - like ionizations and therefore , apparently , it is not needed to facilitate the radiative acceleration to high speeds . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the ionization is moderated , instead , by high gas densities in small outflow sub - structures . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we estimate that the kinetic energy yield from this outflow is at least two orders of magnitude too low to be important for feedback to the host galaxy s evolution .    </S>",
