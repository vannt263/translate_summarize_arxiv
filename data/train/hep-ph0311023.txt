    "the higgs sector is ( so far ) an elusive basic ingredient of the fundamental theory of particle interactions .",
    "searches for higgs bosons , and the study of their properties , are one of the primary goals of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern , which is scheduled to commence taking data in the year 2007 .",
    "the conventional folklore is that ( under reasonable model assumptions ) at least one higgs boson should be discovered at the lhc . in particular ,",
    "if the light higgs predicted by the standard model ( sm ) exists , it will almost certainly be found at the lhc in the first years of running or even maybe before , at the tevatron .",
    "moreover the lhc should provide a complete coverage of the sm higgs mass range .",
    "however there is a strong belief that the standard model , in its minimal form with a single higgs , can not be the fundamental theory of particle interactions .",
    "various extended models predict a large diversity of higgs - like bosons with different masses , couplings and even cp - parities .",
    "the most elaborated extension of the standard model is , currently , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) in which there are three neutral ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) and two charged ( @xmath10 ) higgs bosons , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are cp - even ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath9 is cp - odd . just as for the standard model , this benchmark susy model has been studied in great detail ; for a recent review see  @xcite . in the mssm ,",
    "the properties of the higgs sector are characterized by the values of two independent input parameters , typically chosen to be the pseudoscalar higgs boson mass , @xmath12 , and the ratio , @xmath13 , of the vacuum - expectation - values of the two higgs doublet fields . at tree level ,",
    "the pseudoscalar @xmath9 does not couple to the gauge bosons and its couplings to down- ( up- ) type fermions are ( inversely ) proportional to @xmath13 . within the mssm ,",
    "the mass of the @xmath7-boson is bounded to @xmath14  gev ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) , while the experimental 95% cl lower limit for a neutral scalar higgs is @xmath15  gev  @xcite .    beyond the standard model the properties of the neutral higgs bosons can differ drastically from sm expectations . in some extended models , the limit for a neutral higgs can go down to below 60  gev .",
    "this occurs , for instance in the mssm with explicit cp - violation , where the mass eigenstates of the neutral higgs bosons do not match the cp eigenstates @xmath16 , see , for example ,  @xcite .",
    "further examples are the models with extra dimensions where a higgs can mix with the graviscalar of the randall  sundrum scenario  @xcite , which is called the radion ( see for example @xcite ) . in the latter case , due to the trace anomaly , the gluon  gluon coupling is strongly enhanced , which makes this graviscalar especially attractive for searches in gluon - mediated processes , assuming that the background issues can be overcome .",
    "these extended scenarios would complicate the study of the neutral higgs sector using the conventional ( semi)inclusive strategies .    after the discovery of a higgs candidate the immediate task will be to establish its quantum numbers , to verify the higgs interpretation of the signal , and to make precision measurements of its properties .",
    "the separation and identification of different higgs - like states will be especially challenging .",
    "it will be an even more delicate goal to establish the nature of a newly - discovered heavy resonance state .",
    "for example , how can one discriminate between the higgs of the extended susy sector from the graviscalar of the randall  sundrum scenario ( or , even worse , from a mixture of the higgs and the radion ) .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , the central exclusive diffractive processes ( cedp ) at the lhc can play a crucial role in solving these problems , which are so vital for the higgs physics .",
    "these processes are of the form @xmath17 where the @xmath18 signs denote the rapidity gaps on either side of the higgs - like state @xmath19 .",
    "they have unique advantages as compared to the traditional non - diffractive approaches  @xcite .",
    "these processes allow the properties of @xmath19 to be studied in an environment in which there are no secondaries from the underlying events .",
    "in particular , if the forward protons are tagged , then the mass of the produced central system @xmath19 can be measured to high accuracy by the missing mass method . indeed , by observing the forward protons , as well as the @xmath20 pairs in the central detector",
    ", one can match two simultaneous measurements of the @xmath19 mass : @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , proton taggers allow the damaging effects of multiple interactions per bunch crossing ( pile - up ) to be suppressed and hence offer the possibility of studying cedp processes at higher luminosities  @xcite .",
    "thus the prospects of the precise mass determination of the higgs - like states , and even of the direct measurements of their widths and @xmath20 couplings , looks feasible using these processes .",
    "a promising option is to use the forward proton taggers as a spin - parity analyser  @xcite",
    ". this may provide valuable additional ( and in some cases unique ) information in the unambiguous identification of a newly discovered state .    in section  [ sec : disoverypotential ]",
    "we illustrate the advantages of cedp ,  ( [ eq : cedp ] ) , in exploring the higgs sector in specific parameter ranges of the mssm .",
    "first in section  [ sec : icr ] we consider the so - called `` intense - coupling '' regime  @xcite where the @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 higgs decay modes are suppressed but where , on the other hand , the cedp cross section is enhanced , in comparison with the sm . next ,",
    "in section  2.2 , we discuss the decoupling limit ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) where the light scalar , @xmath7 , looks very similar to the sm higgs . in this case",
    "the discovery of the heavier scalar @xmath8 is crucial to establish the underlying structure of the electroweak - symmetry - breaking dynamics .",
    "if @xmath28  gev , then the @xmath8 boson may be observed and studied in cedp . in section  2.3",
    "we show that cedp may cover the `` windows '' where , once the @xmath7 boson is discovered , it is not possible to disentangle the @xmath8 or @xmath9 bosons by traditional means . in section  3",
    "we explain how studies of cedp may help to determine the properties of the higgs - like states , once they have been discovered .",
    "the plan of the paper is first to present the predictions and then , in section  4 , to explain how the cross sections for the cedp of the @xmath19 cp - even and cp - odd higgs states are calculated . in this section",
    "we also enumerate the uncertainties in the predictions .",
    "simple formulae to approximate the cedp cross sections for @xmath29 with @xmath20 , and the corresponding qcd @xmath30 background , are given in section  5 .",
    "these allow quick , reliable estimates to be made of the signal - to - background ratio for a higgs of any mass , and both cp parities .",
    "in section  6 we focus attention on ways to identify the pseudoscalar boson @xmath9 .",
    "it is unlikely that the pure exclusive diffractive production process will have sufficient events , and so possible semi - inclusive signals are proposed and studied .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to show how the higgs discovery potential at the lhc may be enlarged by using the unique advantages of forward proton tagging .",
    "special attention is paid to the cases where the partial widths for the decay of higgs bosons into two gluons greatly exceed the sm values . as mentioned above",
    ", we shall illustrate the advantages of using forward proton tagging to study the higgs sector by giving predictions for a few examples within the mssm model .",
    "the `` intense - coupling regime '' @xcite is where the masses of all three neutral higgs bosons are close to each other and the value of @xmath13 is large .",
    "then the @xmath31 decay modes ( which are among the main detection modes for the sm higgs ) are strongly suppressed .",
    "this is the regime where the variations of all mssm higgs masses and couplings are very rapid .",
    "this region is considered as one of the most challenging for the ( conventional ) higgs searches at the lhc , see @xcite and references therein . on the other hand , here",
    "the cedp cross sections are enhanced by more than an order of magnitude ( due to the large @xmath32 couplings ) .",
    "therefore the expected significance of the cedp signal becomes quite large .",
    "indeed , this is evident from fig .  1 , which shows the cross sections for the cedp production of @xmath16 bosons as functions of their mass for @xmath33 and 50 .",
    "the cross sections are computed as described in section  5 , with the widths and properties of the higgs scalar ( @xmath34 ) and pseudoscalar ( @xmath9 ) bosons obtained from the hdecay code , version 3.0  @xcite , with all other parameters taken from table  2 of @xcite ; also we take @xmath35 , which means the radiative corrections are included according to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us focus on the main @xmath36 decay mode decay mode .",
    "the use of the @xmath37 decay mode requires an evaluation of the @xmath38 background , especially of the possibility of misidentifying gluon jets as @xmath39 s in the cedp environment .",
    "currently , for inclusive processes , the probability , @xmath40 , to misidentify a gluon as a @xmath39 is estimated to be about 0.002  @xcite . ] .",
    "this mode is well suited for cedp studies , since a @xmath41-even , @xmath42 selection rule  @xcite suppresses the qcd @xmath30 background at lo .",
    "indeed , at the lhc , the signal - to - background ratio is @xmath43 for a standard model higgs boson of mass @xmath44  gev , if the experimental cuts and efficiencies quoted in @xcite are used .",
    "this favourable ratio was obtained since it was argued that proton taggers can achieve a missing mass resolution of @xmath45  gev . due to the enhancement of the production of mssm scalars , for large @xmath13",
    ", the qcd background becomes practically negligible .",
    "note that , normally , to estimate the statistical significance of the measurement of the signal cross section , we use the conservative formula @xmath46 for the statistical error .",
    "however when we are looking for a new particle , which gives some peak on the top of the background , the statistical error may be much lower .",
    "it is given just by the fluctuation of the background ",
    "@xmath47 . on the other hand for a low number of events ,",
    "it is appropriate to use a poisson , rather than a gaussian , distribution .",
    "thus the statistical significance to discover a new particle has to be evaluated more precisely . for instance , with the cuts and efficiencies quoted in [ 11 ] , we estimate that the qcd background is @xmath48 = 40(4 ) events for an integrated luminosity of @xmath49 ( 30  fb@xmath50 ) , if we take @xmath51 gev and @xmath52 gev .",
    "thus , to obtain a confidence coefficient of @xmath53 ( equivalent to a statistical significance of @xmath54 for a gaussian distribution@xcite ) , it is sufficient for the cross section of a higgs signal , times the @xmath30 branching fraction , to satisfy    @xmath55    if we take the integrated luminosity to be @xmath49 ( 30  fb@xmath50 ) .    as can be seen from fig .  1 , for mssm with @xmath56 the expected cedp cross section times branching fraction , @xmath57 , is greater than 0.7fb for masses up to @xmath58 gev . the situation is worse for pseudoscalar , @xmath9 , production , since the cross section is suppressed by the @xmath41-even selection rule .",
    "thus the cedp filters out pseudoscalar production , which allows the possibility to study pure @xmath8 production , see fig .  1",
    ". this may be also useful in the decoupling limit , to which we now turn .",
    "for @xmath59 and @xmath60 , there is a wide domain in mssm parameter space where the light scalar @xmath7 becomes indistinguishable from the sm higgs , and the other two neutral higgs states are approximately degenerate in mass .",
    "this is the so - called decoupling limit  @xcite .",
    "moreover in many theories with a non - minimal higgs sector , there are significant regions of parameter space that approximate the decoupling limit ; see , for instance , @xcite . in this regime",
    "the discovery of the heavier non - minimal higgs scalar @xmath8 is crucial for establishing the underlying structure of the electroweak - symmetry - breaking dynamics . here , forward proton tagging can play an important role in searching for ( at least ) the @xmath8-boson , if it is not too heavy ( @xmath61  gev ) . for large values of @xmath13",
    "the decoupling regime essentially starts at @xmath62  gev . as can be seen in fig .  1",
    ", the cross section is still sufficiently large to ensure the observation of the @xmath8 boson up to @xmath63  gev . to illustrate the moderate @xmath13 region we consider the case @xmath64  gev and @xmath65 . then the cedp cross section is @xmath66 thus for an integrated luminosity of @xmath49 we have about 8.5 events , after applying the experimental cuts and efficiencies discussed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding background is about 2.6  events . using again a poisson distribution , as we did in the case of ( [ eq : cc1 ] ) , then the expected statistical significance to observe such an @xmath8 boson is about @xmath67 .",
    "so detection may be feasible .",
    "the possibility to use exclusive diffractive processes to explore larger masses will depend on various experiment - related factors .",
    "in particular , on the prospects to achieve better mass resolution , @xmath68 , at higher mass , @xmath69 .",
    "there are regions of mssm parameter space where , after the @xmath7 boson is discovered , it will be difficult to identify the heavy @xmath8 or @xmath9 bosons by conventional non - diffractive processes .",
    "can the cedp processes help here ?",
    "first consider the ` notorious hole ' in parameter space ( sometimes called the `` lhc wedge '' ) , defined by @xmath70  gev and @xmath7147  @xcite . in this region",
    ", only the lightest higgs @xmath7 can be discovered even with integrated luminosity of the order of 300  fb@xmath50 .",
    "its properties are nearly indistinguishable from those of a sm higgs .",
    "unfortunately here , even for @xmath8 , the predicted cedp cross section is too low , assuming the efficiencies and cuts of ref .",
    "@xcite ; see the heavy continuous curve in fig .  2",
    ".    however , with the present understanding of the capabilities of the detectors it is plausible that similar windows will occur in the interval @xmath72  gev for @xmath7346 .",
    "that is , it may be impossible to identify the @xmath8 scalar by conventional processes at the @xmath54 confidence level with 300  fb@xmath50 of combined atlas+cms luminosity . from the predictions shown by the dashed line in fig .  2",
    ", we see that the part of this ` hole ' , up to @xmath74  gev , may be covered by cedp . for illustration , consider the case @xmath75  gev and @xmath76 . with an integrated luminosity of @xmath77 , the cedp cross section of ( h)_h = 0.8  fb gives about 40 events , after applying the experimental cuts and efficiencies discussed in ref .",
    "the corresponding background is about 10  events .",
    "thus , if we use a poisson distribution , as we did in the case of ( [ eq : cc1 ] ) , then the expected statistical significance to observe such an @xmath8 boson will exceed @xmath78 .",
    "recently some interesting applications of the cedp to studies of the more exotic higgs scenarios , such as models with cp violation and searches for the radions , have been discussed  @xcite .",
    "however the feasibility of applying these studies will require further critical discussion of the background issues .",
    "as was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the use of cedp , with forward proton tagging , can provide a competitive way to detect a higgs boson .",
    "this approach appears to have special advantages for searches of the cp - even higgses of mssm in the intense - coupling regime .",
    "indeed , the cedp cross section can exceed the sm result by more than an order of magnitude , see fig .  1 .",
    "once a higgs - like signal is observed , it will be extremely important to verify that it is indeed a higgs boson .",
    "here we describe where forward proton tagging can provide valuable help to establish the nature of the newly discovered state and to verify whether it can be interpreted as a higgs boson .",
    "we also emphasize that cedp are well suited to study specific cases which pose difficulties for probing the higgs sector at the lhc .",
    "it is generally believed that a detailed coverage of the higgs sector will require complementary research programmes at the lhc and a linear @xmath79 collider .",
    "interestingly , in some sense , the implementation of forward proton taggers allows some studies which otherwise would have to await the construction of a linear @xmath80 collider .",
    "moreover , in addition to the other advantages , forward proton tagging offers the possibility to study new physics in the photon ",
    "photon collisions , see for example  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , if a candidate higgs signal is detected it will be a challenging task to prove its higgs identity .",
    "unlike the conventional inclusive approaches , the very fact of seeing the resonance state in cedp automatically implies that the newly discovered state has the following fundamental properties .",
    "it must have zero electric charge and be a colour singlet .",
    "furthermore , assuming @xmath41 and @xmath81 conservation , the dominantly produced state has a positive natural parity , @xmath82 and even cp . recall that the installation of forward proton taggers also allows the attractive possibility of a spin - parity analysis .",
    "this may provide valuable additional ( and in some cases unique ) leverage in establishing the origin of the discovered candidate state .",
    "in particular , assuming cp conservation , the cedp allow the @xmath83 states to be filtered out , leaving only an ambiguity between the @xmath84 and @xmath85 states .",
    "though without further efforts the @xmath85 state can not be ruled out , this would not be the most likely choice .    as discussed in @xcite , studying of the azimuthal correlations of the outgoing protons can allow further spin - parity analysis . in particular , it may be possible to isolate the @xmath86 state .",
    "the azimuthal distribution distinguishes between the production of scalar and pseudoscalar particles  @xcite .",
    "note that with the forward protons we can determine the cp - properties of the higgs boson irrespective of the decay mode .",
    "moreover , cedp allow the observation of the interference effects between the cp - even and cp - odd @xmath87 transitions ( see @xcite ) .    following the discovery , and the determination of the basic quantum numbers , of the new state , the next step is to check whether the coupling properties match those expected for the higgs boson .",
    "for this , we need to detect the signal in at least two different channels .",
    "the cedp mechanism provides an excellent opportunity background . ] to detect the @xmath30 mode .",
    "the other decay channel which is appropriate for cedp studies is the @xmath88 decay mode ( or @xmath24 , or @xmath89 , if the event rate is sufficient ) .",
    "these measurements allow a non - trivial check of the theoretical models .",
    "for example , the precise measurement of the partial decay widths into tau and bottom quark pairs can provide a way to discriminate between supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric higgs sectors , and to probe cp - violating effects ( for recent papers see , for instance ,  @xcite and references therein ) .    for illustration ,",
    "consider the following topical example , namely the intense coupling limit of mssm .",
    "as mentioned before , this regime is especially difficult for conventional inclusive studies of the mssm higgs  @xcite . on the other hand , with forward proton taggers ,",
    "cedp offer an ideal probe .    for numerical purposes ,",
    "we choose the same parameters as in @xcite , in particular , @xmath33 , together with results for @xmath56 .",
    "the salient features of this regime are that there is almost a mass degeneracy of the neutral higgs states , and their total widths can be quite large ( due to the @xmath90 increase ) and reach up to 12  gev .",
    "this can be seen from fig .  3 , where we plot the mass differences @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and the widths of the bosons , as a function of the pseudoscalar mass @xmath12 .",
    "it is especially difficult to disentangle the higgs bosons in the region around @xmath93  gev , where all three neutral higgs states practically overlap  @xcite .",
    "since the traditional non - diffractive approaches do not , with the exception of the @xmath23 and @xmath94 modes , provide a mass resolution better than 1020  gev , all three higgs bosons will appear as one resonance decay mode is hopeless .",
    "moreover , the vector - boson - fusion higgs production , with the @xmath30 or @xmath37 decays , does not allow the separation of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 peaks due to the poor invariant mass resolution .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , only the detection of the rare dimuon higgs decay mode may provide a chance to separate the higgs states in inclusive production .",
    "even this would require that the higgs mass splitting exceeds at 35  gev . ] .",
    "as an example , we give the expected number of cedp signal and background events for @xmath95 for @xmath96 gev , using the efficiencies and angular cuts adopted in ref .  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath13 = 30(50 ) , the number of the @xmath97 signal events , @xmath98 = 0.35(1 ) , while the qcd background is @xmath99 for @xmath52 gev . for this choice of parameters , @xmath100 gev , and",
    "the number of the @xmath101 events is @xmath102 = 30(71 ) with background @xmath48 = 3.5(3.2 ) .",
    "the corrresponding numbers for the @xmath8 boson are @xmath103 gev , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "an immediate advantage of cedp , for studying this troublesome region , is that the @xmath9  contribution is strongly suppressed , while the @xmath7 and @xmath8 states can be well separated ( @xmath106  gev ) given the anticipated experimental mass resolution of @xmath107  gev  @xcite , see fig .",
    "note that precision measurements of the two cp - even higgs states may allow a direct determination of the basic mssm parameter , @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , the forward tagging approach can provide a direct measurement of the width , becomes comparable to the mass resolution , @xmath68 , the zero - width approximation is not valid any more .",
    "therefore in calculations of the cross sections the mass resolution and large - width effects should be taken into account .",

    "3 . recall that the width measurement can play an important role in the understanding of higgs dynamics .",
    "it would be instructive to observe this phenomenon experimentally .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , for @xmath111 the central exclusive signal should be still accessible at the lhc up to an @xmath8 mass about 250  gev .",

    ". then we integrate down in @xmath154 until @xmath163 are close to @xmath164 , where the contribution vanishes due to the presence of the @xmath135-factor .",
    "this will slightly overestimate the cross sections , as for @xmath165 the gluon density has a positive anomalous dimension ( @xmath166 with @xmath167 ) and decreases with decreasing @xmath168 .",
    "a lower extreme is to remove the contribution below @xmath162  gev entirely .",
    "even with this extreme choice , the @xmath169 cross section is not changed greatly ; it is depleted by about 20% . on the other hand , as anticipated , for @xmath86 production , the infrared region is much more important and the cut reduces the cross section by a factor of 5 .    another uncertainty is the choice of factorization scale @xmath126 .",
    "note that in comparison with previous calculations  @xcite , which were done in the limit of proton transverse momenta , @xmath170 , now we include the explicit @xmath171-dependence in the @xmath154-loop integral of ( [ eq : rat3 ] ) .",
    "we resum the ` soft ' gluon logarithms , @xmath172 , in the @xmath135-factor .",
    "so now the @xmath135-factor includes both the soft and collinear single logarithms .",
    "the only uncertainty is the non - logarithmic nlo contribution",
    ". this may be modelled by changing the factorization scale , @xmath126 , which fixes the maximal @xmath173 of the gluon in the nlo loop correction . as the default we have used @xmath160",
    "; that is the largest @xmath173 allowed in the process with total energy @xmath174 .",
    "choosing a lower scale @xmath175 would enlarge the cross sections by about 30% . recall that the general calculation is performed in the collinear approximation .",
    "however , when we take account of large - angle soft gluon emission in the form factor , that is in the calculation of the virtual - loop correction , as in ( [ eq : t ] ) and ( [ eq : monday1 ] ) , we go beyond the collinear approximation .",
    "the corresponding real contribution in ( [ eq : rat6 ] ) is represented by @xmath144 and the derivative of the @xmath176 factor . strictly speaking , for the case of large - angle emission there will be some small deviation from this simplified formula .",
    "this gives an extra uncertainty of the order of 10% .",
    "next there is some uncertainty in the gluon distribution itself . to evaluate this , we compare predictions obtained using cteq6 m  @xcite , mrst99  @xcite and mrst02  @xcite partons . for @xmath169 production at the lhc , with @xmath159  gev and @xmath160",
    ", we find that the effective gluon ",
    "gluon luminosity , before screening , is @xmath177 respectively .",
    "this spread of values arises because the cteq gluon is 7% higher , and the mrst02 gluon 4% lower , than the default mrst99 gluon , in the relevant kinematic region .",
    "the sensitivity to the gluon arises because the central exclusive diffractive cross section is proportional to the 4th power of the gluon . for @xmath86 production ,",
    "the corresponding numbers are @xmath178 . up to now",
    ", we have discussed the effective gluon  gluon luminosity .",
    "however , nnlo corrections may occur in the @xmath179 fusion vertex .",
    "these give an extra uncertainty of @xmath180 .",
    "note that we have already accounted for the nlo corrections for this vertex  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we need to consider the soft rescattering which leads to a rather small probability , @xmath181 , that the rapidity gaps survive the soft @xmath182 interaction , see fig .",
    "[ fig:3](b ) . from the analysis  @xcite of all soft @xmath182 data we estimate the accuracy of the prediction for @xmath183 is @xmath184 .",
    "one check of the eikonal model calculations of @xmath183 is the estimate of the diffractive dijet production rate measured by the cdf collaboration @xcite at the tevatron .",
    "the rate , when calculated using factorization and the diffractive structure functions obtained from hera data , lies about a factor of 10 above the cdf data .",
    "however , when rescattering corrections are included , and the survival probabilities computed , remarkably good agreement with the cdf measurements is obtained @xcite .",
    "combining together all these sources of error we find that the prediction for the @xmath169 cross section is uncertain to a factor of almost 2.5 , that is up to almost 2.5 , and down almost to @xmath185 , times the default value .",
    "gev , to be 2.2  fb with an uncertainty given by the range 0.95.5  fb . ] on the other hand , @xmath86 production is uncertain by this factor just from the first ( infrared ) source of error , with the remaining errors contributing almost another factor of 2.5 .",
    "here we give simple approximate formulae for the cross sections for the central exclusive diffractive production of @xmath117 bosons , @xmath186 , and for the qcd @xmath30 background as a function of mass . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the cross section may be written as the product of the effective gluon ",
    "gluon luminosity @xmath187 and the cross section for the hard subprocess @xmath188 _ cedp = l .",

    "the @xmath86 amplitude contains the kinematic factor @xmath191 , which implies that in impact parameter space the fourier transform contains the factor @xmath192  @xcite .",
    "thus the @xmath86 amplitude tends to populate larger impact parameters , where the suppression caused by soft rescattering is less effective , than does the @xmath169 amplitude . the @xmath179 subprocesses cross section is , in the zero width approximation , _",

    "the @xmath30 background processes were discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite for a standard model @xmath194 signal , with @xmath195  gev .",
    "there were four appreciable sources of @xmath30 background , each with a background - to - signal ratio in the range @xmath1960.08 , after the appropriate cuts . in brief , these give contributions to the background subprocess cross sections of the following approximate forms    * @xmath197(@xmath30 mimicked by @xmath198 ) : @xmath199 , * @xmath200(@xmath201 admixture ) : @xmath202 , * @xmath203(@xmath204 , @xmath42 contribution ) : @xmath205 , * nlo @xmath206 contribution : @xmath207 ,    where the renormalisation scale is specified by @xmath208 .",
    "the @xmath209 superscript is to denote that each incoming gluon to the hard subprocess belongs to a colour - singlet @xmath120-channel state , see fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "note that all background contributions go like @xmath210 , except for ( iii ) .",
    "in addition , for fixed missing mass resolution @xmath68 , the background contains a factor @xmath211 .",
    "thus for large @xmath212  gev the background cross section behaves roughly as _",
    "b = l _ b ~m / m^6 , while the higgs signal behaves as _",
    "h = l _ h ~1/m^3 . to obtain a more precise behaviour",
    "one can use ( [ eq : integlumin ] ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we found a signal - to - background ratio @xmath213 for a @xmath195  gev standard model higgs boson .",
    "the ratio may , however , be appreciably enhanced for susy higgs with large @xmath69 , and/or large @xmath13 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in the region where the background is larger than the signal ( @xmath214 ) , the statistical significance of the signal @xmath215 is practically independent of mass , assuming that the experimental resolution @xmath68 is mass independent .",
    "moreover , for a low mass , where @xmath30 pairs in the @xmath42 state , ( iii ) , give the dominant contribution to the background , the statistical significance increases with mass , as here @xmath216 .    finally , it is important to note that there are still various open questions which must be addressed by experimentalists in order to establish the feasibility of cedp for higgs searches at the lhc .",
    "one of the most challenging issues concerns triggering .",
    "assuming that the trigger is based on the central detector only , the main task is to reduce the rate of triggering jets in order not to reach saturation of the trigger .",
    "we present below some numbers which may be useful when considering this issue .    based on the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , we see that the cross section for the cedp of dijets with @xmath217 gev is 200 pb . if we assume that the proton tagging efficiency is 0.6 , then this yields 0.12 events / sec for a luminosity of @xmath218 . at the same time , the inclusive cross section for production of a pair of jets , each with @xmath217 gev is about 50 @xmath126b .",
    "this leads to 50,000 events / sec , which greatly exceeds the trigger saturation limit . for cms , for example",
    ", this latter limit is 100 events / sec  @xcite .",
    "therefore it appears necessary to devise additional topological requirements in the level-1 trigger for the exclusive signal , such as making use of the presence of the rapidity gaps .",
    "if the exclusive diffractive cross sections for scalar and pseudoscalar higgs production were comparable , it would be possible to separate them readily by the missing mass scan , and by the study of the azimuthal correlations between the outgoing proton momenta .",
    "however , we have seen that the cross section for pseudoscalar higgs exclusive production is , unfortunately , strongly suppressed by the @xmath41-even selection rule , which holds for cedp at lo . for values of @xmath21915 ,",
    "the separation between the @xmath220 and @xmath9 bosons is much larger than their widths , see fig .",
    ". hence it might be just possible to observe the pseudoscalar in cedp .",
    "for example , for @xmath221 and @xmath222  gev , the mass separation , 3.6  gev , between @xmath7 and @xmath9 is about 8 times larger than the width @xmath223 .",
    "the cross section ( a)_a 0.15  fb , when allowing for the large uncertainties in @xmath224 , could be just sufficient to bring the process to the edge of observability .",
    "on the other hand , one may consider the semi - exclusive process ppp + jj + p , [ eq : sep ] where the higgs bosons , @xmath225 , are accompanied by two gluon jets with transverse momenta @xmath171 satisfying @xmath226  .",
    "the emission of soft gluons , with energies ( in the @xmath19 rest frame ) @xmath227 , does not affect the @xmath41-even selection rule .",
    "thus in this region the scalar @xmath8 boson will be dominantly produced in process ( [ eq : sep ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the domain x_i 2e_i / m_~1 we lose the selection rule and have comparable @xmath8 and @xmath9 production .",
    "moreover the azimuthal angular distribution production was mentioned in ref .",
    "however , the proof of the feasibility of such an approach in non - diffractive @xmath228 production requires further study of the possible dilution of the effect caused by parton showers ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "an exclusive environment of the jets may be needed . ] for the gluon jets is different for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 cases .",
    "in particular , for gluons with @xmath229 accompanying @xmath9 production , the azimuthal distribution is practically flat ( at lo ) , whereas for @xmath8 production it has the form @xmath230 .",
    "this observation may be used to distinguish between @xmath8 and @xmath9 production , and to study better the properties of the @xmath9 boson .",
    "of course , we have to pay a price , of about a factor @xmath231 , to produce two extra jets with @xmath171 in the range @xmath232  gev , in a rapidity interval with @xmath233 .",
    "however , this is less than the suppression of @xmath9 production by the @xmath41-even selection rule . for @xmath234 and @xmath235  gev the cross section still exceeds 1  fb .    to gain more insight , it is informative to return to the original central exclusive diffractive process , which we sketch in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) . in the equivalent gluon approximation ,",
    "the polarization vectors @xmath236 of the gluons , carrying momentum fractions @xmath237 , are aligned along the corresponding gluon transverse momenta @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
    "for very forward protons with @xmath240 , this leads to a correlation between the polarization vectors , namely @xmath241 is parallel to @xmath242 .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath243 production vertices behave as @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",
    "therefore the exclusive diffractive production of the pseudoscalar @xmath9 boson is strongly suppressed are parallel to @xmath246 , it follows , after integration over the azimuthal angle of @xmath246 , that the lo qcd production of @xmath30 pair is also suppressed by a factor @xmath247 ; which results in a very low qcd @xmath248 background to the cedp . ] .    to change the @xmath120-channel gluon polarization",
    "we need particle emission",
    ". the best possibility would be to emit either a @xmath249 or a @xmath250 meson .",
    "unfortunately the corresponding cross sections are too low .",
    "we lose more than a factor of @xmath251 , which is a stronger suppression than that coming from the @xmath41-even , @xmath252 selection rule .",
    "for this reason we considered the possibility of emitting a ( colour singlet ) pair of gluons , that is process ( [ eq : sep ] ) . for soft @xmath253 emission ,",
    "the dominant contribution comes from the term in the triple - gluon vertex which contains @xmath254 , and so does not change the gluon polarization vector . here",
    "the indices @xmath255 and @xmath256 correspond to the @xmath120-channel gluon polarization before and after the emission of the @xmath257-channel gluon .",
    "however for large @xmath258 the major contribution comes from the term with @xmath259 , where @xmath260 is the @xmath257-channel gluon polarization index . in this case after the emission , the new @xmath120-channel polarization vector is directed along the new transverse momentum @xmath261 .",
    "thus for @xmath262 the cross sections for @xmath8 and @xmath9 production are comparable , but now the lo qcd background is no longer suppressed .",
    "maybe the best chance to identify the @xmath118 boson is to observe the double - diffractive inclusive process pp x + + y , [ eq : a1 ] where both protons are destroyed . in terms of @xmath120-channel gluon polarization , this is equivalent to the limit @xmath263 in the previous reaction ( [ eq : sep ] ) .",
    "process ( [ eq : a1 ] ) has the advantage of a much larger cross section , which came from the @xmath264 integrals limited by the proton form factors , as in ( [ eq : rat5a ] ) ( see also eq.(8 ) in ref.@xcite ) , here we have logarithmic @xmath265 integrals over the intervals @xmath266 .",
    "moreover , the sudakov supression ( which arises from the requirement that no extra relatively hard gluons are emitted with transverse momenta @xmath267 in the interval @xmath268 ) is much weaker than for the exclusive process due to the larger values of @xmath151 , see @xcite .",
    "therefore the effective @xmath269 luminosity for double - diffractive inclusive production is much larger than in the cedp case . ] .",
    "however , just as for the above semi - exclusive process , we do not have the @xmath252 selection rule to suppress the @xmath248 background , nor do we have the possibility of the good missing mass resolution . on the other hand , the @xmath269 luminosity is more than order of magnitude larger than for the pure exclusive case . for example , for double - diffractive inclusive production , with the rapidity gaps @xmath270 ,",
    "the luminosity is 20 times larger than that for the exclusive diffractive production of a higgs boson with mass @xmath271 gev ( see for details @xcite ) .",
    "so , even for the @xmath37 decay mode we expect a cross section , @xmath272 , of about 20  fb for @xmath9 production in the mssm with @xmath33 and @xmath273  gev .",
    "this looks promising , provided that the probability for gluon misidentification as a @xmath39 is less than 1/150 , which appears to be feasible@xcite .    despite the qcd background",
    ", the observation of the @xmath9 boson also appears to be feasible for the @xmath248 decay mode , since then @xmath274 fb which gives a signal - to - background ratio of @xmath275 .",
    "we have evaluated the qcd @xmath248 background using the lo formula for the @xmath276 cross section ( without any @xmath122 factor ) with the polar angle cut @xmath277 as was done in @xcite , and assumed a mass resolution of @xmath278 gev .",
    "the efficiency of tagging the @xmath279 jets was taken to be about 0.6 @xcite .",
    "this results in a statistical significance factor , @xmath280 , for the background then the statistical significance is about @xmath281 . ] of the signal for the @xmath9 boson of @xmath282 , for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb@xmath50 .",
    "moreover one can measure the azimuthal angle @xmath283 between the transverse energy @xmath284 flows in the forward and backward regions , that is between the total transverse momenta of the @xmath285 and @xmath286 systems .",
    "the angular dependence is driven by the momenta transferred across the rapidity gaps , and has the form & ^2 &  h(0^+ ) + and & ^2 &  a(0 ^ - ) , whereas for the qcd @xmath30 background the @xmath283 dependence is flat ( if we neglect the quark mass ( @xmath287 ) and average over the @xmath279-jet momentum direction ; see eq.(15 ) of @xcite for @xmath288 ) .",
    "thus we may suppress the @xmath289 signal by selecting events with @xmath283 close to @xmath290 .",
    "we emphasize that here we deal with rather large @xmath291 jets , @xmath292 gev , and so the angular dependences are largely insensitive to the soft rescatterings .",
    "furthermore , instead of measuring the @xmath293 of the jets ( as in ref.@xcite ) , for process ( [ eq : a1 ] ) it is enough to measure the total transverse energy @xmath284 in the forward ( and backward ) regions of proton dissociation .",
    "recall that the effective @xmath269 luminosity for the inclusive process ( [ eq : a1 ] ) was evaluated using the leading order formula .",
    "thus we can not exclude rather large nlo corrections , particularly for the non - forward bfkl amplitude .",
    "on the other hand , here , we do not enter the infrared domain .",
    "moreover , with `` skewed '' kinematics , the nlo bfkl corrections are expected to be much smaller than in forward case .",
    "so we may expect that the uncertainty of the prediction is about factor of 3 - 4 ( or even better ) .",
    "the central exclusive diffractive processes promise a rich physics menu for studying the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking , and the detailed properties of the higgs sector .",
    "we have seen , within mssm , that the expected cedp cross sections are large enough , especially for large @xmath13 , both in the intense coupling and the decoupling regimes .",
    "thus cedp offers a way to cover those regions of mssm parameter space which may be hard to access with the conventional ( semi ) inclusive approaches .",
    "this considerably extends the physics potential of the lhc and may provide studies which are complementary , both to the traditional non - diffractive approaches at the lhc , and to the physics program of a future linear @xmath79 collider .",
