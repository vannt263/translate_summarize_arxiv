    "with the fruitful running of babar , belle , tevatron , lhcb and the coming super - kekb experiments , rare b - meson decays play a vital role in precisely testing the standard model  ( sm ) and deciphering the flavour structure of possible new physics  ( np ) models .",
    "although most of the experimental measurements are in good agreement with the sm predictions , some tensions or the so - called puzzles have been observed in the quark - flavour sector  @xcite over the past few years . with more statistics collected ,",
    "some of them have gone , but some still persist and are confirmed by independent measurements .    for instance , for the cp - violating phase @xmath20 , which is defined as the weak phase difference between the @xmath1 mixing amplitude and the @xmath21 decay amplitude , a large deviation from the sm prediction was observed by the cdf  @xcite and d0  @xcite collaborations around 2008 . a combined model - independent analysis performed by the utfit collaboration found that the discrepancy was even more than @xmath22  @xcite , which attracted much attention . in our previous paper",
    "@xcite , we pursued possible solution through a family non - universal @xmath0 boson and constrained the parameter space with these old data .",
    "however , the most recent updated measurements from cdf  @xcite , d0  @xcite , atlas  @xcite and lhcb  @xcite are now in good agreement with the sm expectation .",
    "furthermore , beside the cp - violating phase @xmath20 , measurements of the other observables related to @xmath1 mixing , including the mass difference @xmath23 , the decay width difference @xmath24 and the like - sign dimuon charge asymmetry , have also been updated recently , which could put a much stronger constraint on various np models .",
    "therefore , it is worth to reinvestigate the np effects with these updated experimental data .",
    "as is known , the four @xmath25 decays are among the most important hadronic b - meson decay modes with rich phenomenology . while their branching fractions have all been measured with high precision , it is still very difficult to explain the so - called  @xmath10 cp puzzle \" , _",
    "i.e. , _ why does the difference between the measured direct cp asymmetries @xmath26 and @xmath27 differ from zero by @xmath28 .",
    "it is noted that a family non - universal @xmath0 model could provide a possible solution to the observed  @xmath10 cp puzzle \"  @xcite . since many other decay modes , such as @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , as well as @xmath29 and @xmath30 ,",
    "involve also the same quark - level @xmath31  ( @xmath32 ) transitions , a combined investigation with these closely related decay modes taken into account at the same time is very necessary .",
    "moreover , the correlations between observables of these decays are powerful probes of np effects .    in a family non - universal @xmath0 model , the @xmath0 couplings to different quarks are generally different from each other . focusing on the hadronic b - meson",
    "decays induced by quark - level @xmath2 transitions , one may check if the flavour - conserving @xmath17 coupling differs from the @xmath18 one .",
    "this could be done by studying the penguin - dominated @xmath16 decays . with the @xmath3 coupling restricted by @xmath1 mixing ,",
    "the @xmath17 coupling is then accessible from these decays .",
    "the direct search for @xmath0 bosons is also an important physics program of current and future high - energy colliders  @xcite .",
    "present limits from direct production at the lhc and virtual effects at lep , through interference or mixing with the sm @xmath33 boson , imply that the new @xmath0 bosons are rather heavy and mix very little with the @xmath33 boson . depending on the considered theoretical model , @xmath0 masses of the order of @xmath34  @xcite and @xmath35 mixing angles at the level of a few per mil  @xcite",
    "are already excluded .",
    "it is expected that a @xmath0 boson , if higher than about @xmath36 and with order one couplings to sm fermions , could be discovered at a high luminosity @xmath37 lhc run  @xcite .",
    "the future @xmath38 international linear collider  ( ilc ) with high center - of - mass energies and longitudinally polarized beams could even go beyond the capabilities of the @xmath39 lhc  @xcite .",
    "after the discovery of a @xmath0 boson at high - energy colliders , further detailed diagnostics of its couplings needs to be done in order to identify the correct theoretical framework .    motivated by the above arguments , in this paper , we shall perform a comprehensive analysis of the impact of a family non - universal @xmath0 boson on hadronic @xmath2 transitions .",
    "such a family non - universal @xmath0 model , featured by tree - level flavour - changing neutral current  ( fcnc ) and new cp - violating effect beyond the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa  ( ckm ) picture  @xcite , has been detailed in refs .",
    "@xcite and attracted much attention in recent years , for instance in refs .",
    "the study of @xmath0 effects on low - energy flavour physics is very important for the direct searches and the specific model building . in our previous works",
    "@xcite , we have performed detailed investigations of the explicit structures of the effective @xmath0 chiral coupling matrices and its effects in @xmath2 transitions .",
    "since then , measurements of many related observables have been significantly refined , which might affect our previous analyses and conclusions .",
    "it is , therefore , necessary to make a comprehensive reanalysis of these interesting processes , which are summarized and classified in table  [ clas ] .",
    "our strategy is the following : firstly , we extract the information about flavour - changing @xmath3 coupling from @xmath1 mixing .",
    "then , with the restricted @xmath3 coupling as input , we discuss the flavour - conserving @xmath0 couplings through the other decay modes listed in table  [ clas ] .",
    "meanwhile , the space of @xmath3 coupling could possibly be further bounded .",
    "after that , it is expected to get the explicit numerical results of the effective @xmath0 chiral coupling matrices and to check if the @xmath0 couplings are universal for the first two generations .",

    "@xcite indicate that the constraints from @xmath65 mixing on the module of @xmath66 are quite weak , because the observables @xmath67 and @xmath68 are governed , respectively , by the real and the imaginary part of @xmath69 ; it was found that the @xmath0 contribution to @xmath68 even vanishes when @xmath70  @xcite .",

[ fczpspac ] , the two parameters @xmath58 and @xmath43 could not simultaneously take the same signs , which is mainly required by the observable @xmath19 . with these numerical results of @xmath0 couplings as inputs , our theoretical predictions for the observables of @xmath45 decays",
    "are then presented in the fourth column of table  [ phikobs ] , from which one can find that the predicted @xmath19 agrees well with the data .",
    "in this paper , motivated by the latest experimental data of @xmath1 mixing and various hadronic @xmath2 transitions , we have performed a comprehensive reanalysis of the impact of a family non - universal @xmath0 boson on these processes . for hadronic b - meson decays , our studies of the @xmath0 effects are performed in the  sm limit \" , _",

    "furthermore , the direct cp asymmetries of these hadronic b - meson decays put stringent constraints on the weak phase @xmath83 and the flavor - conserving @xmath0 couplings .",

    "the @xmath84 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 decays , being induced by the same quark - level @xmath14 transitions , could provide further tests of such a family non - universal @xmath0 model with the successful running of lhcb .",

    "@xmath10 cp puzzle \" and probing the proposed np explanations . * to get information about the @xmath17 coupling and check if the couplings of @xmath0 boson to quarks are universal for the first two generations , we have also studied the penguin - dominated @xmath16 decays .",
    "the numerical results for @xmath17 couplings are summarized in table  [ zpparevaluess ] .",
    "it is found that , due to the large @xmath19 reported by the babar collaboration , a significant @xmath0 correction is required and the left - handed @xmath17 coupling is different from the @xmath18 one .",
    "however , as the lhcb measurement conflicts slightly with the babar data and their experimental uncertainties are still quite large , the refined measurements are required to either confirm or refute such a finding .    as a final comment",
    ", we would like to point out that , given the current lower limits on @xmath86 set by the atlas and cms collaborations  @xcite , the @xmath0 effects on @xmath1 mixing and hadronic b - meson decays are going to be small , and are usually plagued by large experimental and theoretical uncertainties .",

    "<S> motivated by the latest improved measurements of b - meson decays , we make a comprehensive analysis of the impact of a family non - universal @xmath0 boson on @xmath1 mixing and two - body hadronic b - meson decays , all being characterized by the quark - level @xmath2 transition . </S>",
    "<S> explicitly 22 decay modes and the related 52 observables are considered , and some interesting correlations between them are also carefully examined . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the allowed oases of @xmath3 coupling parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 are extracted from @xmath1 mixing . </S>",
    "<S> then , in the  sm limit \"  ( _ i.e. , _ no new types of @xmath0-induced four - quark operators arise compared to the sm case ) , we study the @xmath0 effects on @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 decays . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that a new weak phase @xmath9 is crucial for resolving the observed `` @xmath10 cp puzzle '' and the allowed oases of the other @xmath0 coupling parameters are also strongly restricted . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the @xmath0 effects on @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 decays , being induced by the same quark - level @xmath14 transitions , are also investigated . </S>",
    "<S> especially , it is found that the decay @xmath15 , once measured , would play a key role in revealing the observed </S>",
    "<S>  @xmath10 cp puzzle \" and probing possible new physics hints . </S>",
    "<S> finally , to check the non - universality of @xmath0 couplings to light - quark pairs , we have studied the @xmath16 decays in detail and found that the left - handed @xmath17 coupling is different from the @xmath18 one , which is due to the large @xmath19 reported by the babar collaboration .    </S>",
