    "the low - energy effective theory describing the dynamics of a collection of wrapped d - branes at small separations is given by quiver quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "these d - branes form bound states and , depending on parameters , can either be well separated or on top of each other . when well separated , the theory is on the coulomb branch , parametrized by a macroscopic vev @xmath2 for the fields describing the separation between the branes .",
    "conversely , when the branes are on top of each other , the theory is on the higgs branch , parametrized by a large vev @xmath3 for the field representing the light stretched string mode between the branes .    in this paper we will consider the simplest example of quiver quantum mechanics , describing the dynamics of a pair of d - branes with a single light stretched string mode between them . being a supersymmetric theory ,",
    "the relative separation between the branes lives in a vector multiplet @xmath4 and the lightest stretched string mode lives in a chiral multiplet @xmath5 .",
    "these models have proven fruitful playgrounds for the study of supersymmetric black hole bound states at weak coupling @xcite .",
    "however , one obvious question remains unsolved : what is the structure of the bound state wavefunctions ? while supersymmetry allows us to make some statements about the structure of the ground states , the full ground state wavefunctions remain unknown @xcite .",
    "this is because , while simpler than the full schrdinger equation , the bps equations remain too difficult to solve analytically .",
    "the situation is worse for the excited states , where we have to abandon the crutch of supersymmetry altogether .",
    "it is our interest in this paper to construct the bps and excited states of this model .",
    "we will not be able to do so analytically , but there exist numerical methods to compute the eigenspectra of differential operators on a finite domain , see e.g. @xcite . using these techniques",
    "we numerically solve the schrdinger equation , plot bound state wavefunctions , and determine their energies . in our analysis , we find that the physics is governed by a dimensionless quantity @xmath1 defined in ( [ nu ] ) , which is inversely proportional to the fayet - iliopoulos parameter @xmath6 .",
    "the quantity @xmath1 dictates whether the higgs branch or the coulomb branch is the dominant description of the dynamics . in studying the wavefunctions and their dependence on @xmath1",
    ", we uncover that the two branches never quite decouple and the wavefunction has nonzero support in both branches for any value of @xmath1 .",
    "since this model is supersymmetric , much work has gone into studying features of the ground states .",
    "for example , the ground state wavefunction was previously studied in a born - oppenheimer approximation @xcite , which involves splitting the hamiltonian @xmath7 into a vector part @xmath8 and a chiral part @xmath9 and putting the chiral degrees of freedom in the harmonic oscillator ground state of @xmath9 .",
    "one then ` integrates out ' the chiral multiplet and solves the effective supersymmetric quantum mechanics on the vector multiplet degrees of freedom .",
    "this approximation is self - consistent if we are on the coulomb branch , that is if the ground state is such that the branes are well separated , and is only valid for large values of @xmath10 .",
    "one easy way to see this is that integrating out the chiral degrees of freedom generates a nontrivial metric on the moduli space of the vector multiplet , which appears in the effective lagrangian as @xmath11 the moduli space metric is singular at the origin where the approximation breaks down .",
    "the structure of the ground state wavefunction near the origin has previously been out of reach , and herein we fill this gap .",
    "interestingly the effective quantum mechanics on the coulomb branch of this model has an enhanced symmetry , allowing for a full determination of the spectrum on the coulomb branch @xcite . in computing excited state wavefunctions",
    "we numerically compute the energy gap between the supersymmetric ground state and the first excited state as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "we verify that the gap approaches the analytically determined value on the coulomb branch as we increase @xmath1 .",
    "recently @xcite the witten index @xmath12 , twisted by a combination of global symmetries , has been computed for various quivers ; and for the model of interest in this paper , @xmath13 ( depending on the sign of the fayet - iliopoulos parameter @xmath6 ) . we indeed find a single bosonic ground state in the correct representation of the global symmetry , meaning our result can be thought of as the first _ in silico _ experimental confirmation of the mathematically predicted bps spectrum of the model .",
    "moreover , using the methods described in this note we have access to more than the count of bps states .",
    "this includes plots of the ground state and excited state wavefunctions , the gap with the first excited state as well as various field expectation values .",
    "the numerical methods we describe will hopefully make the study of the quantum nature of weakly coupled black hole bound states more tractable , and can potentially provide a useful experimental testing ground for other witten index calculations .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section [ setup ] we present the supercharges and symmetry generators of the theory .",
    "these fix the wavefunctions up to their dependence on radial variables .",
    "we also give a quick review of the stringy interpretation of this model . in section [ groundstatesec ]",
    "we provide the bps equations obeyed by the ground state wavefunction , suitably reduced via symmetries .",
    "we also plot numerical solutions ( bps and non - bps ) for the full schrdinger problem in the singlet sector of the bosonic symmetry group .",
    "we study the dependence of the bps and non - bps wavefunctions on @xmath1 .",
    "we conclude in section [ outlook ] .",
    "we have collected formulae in appendices [ sphereapp ] and [ wavefunceqs ] and review the born - oppenheimer approximate ground state wavefunction in appendix [ boapp ] .",
    "in this paper we focus on the @xmath0 supersymmetric quantum mechanics defined by the following four supercharges : @xmath14_\\alpha^{~\\,\\gamma}\\left(\\bar{\\psi}\\epsilon\\right)_\\gamma+i\\left[\\nabla_{\\vec{\\mathbf{x}}}\\cdot\\vec{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}-\\left(|\\phi|^2+\\theta\\right)\\mathds{1}\\right]_\\alpha^{~\\,\\gamma}\\lambda_\\gamma~,\\label{q}\\\\ \\bar{q}^\\beta&\\equiv-\\sqrt{2}\\left(\\epsilon\\psi\\right)^\\gamma\\left[\\mathds{1}\\,\\partial_{\\phi}+\\bar{\\phi}\\ , \\vec{\\mathbf{x}}\\cdot\\vec{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}\\right]_\\gamma^{~\\,\\beta}+i\\,\\bar{\\lambda}^\\gamma\\left[\\nabla_{\\vec{\\mathbf{x}}}\\cdot\\vec{\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}+\\left(|\\phi|^2+\\theta\\right)\\mathds{1}\\right]_\\gamma^{~\\,\\beta}~.\\label{qb } \\ ] ] we will discuss the stringy origin of this quantum mechanics in section [ stringy ] , and refer the reader to @xcite for a more in depth treatment .",
    "the lagrangian of the model can also be found in @xcite . in the above expressions ,",
    "the @xmath15 are the usual pauli matrices and @xmath16 .",
    "this quantum mechanics arises as the dimensional reduction of a @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 gauge theory coupled to chiral matter@xcite .",
    "the matter content therefore includes a vector multiplet @xmath4 and a chiral multiplet @xmath5 , along with its complex conjugate . nor @xmath20 appear in the supercharges .",
    "this is because they are replaced by their on - shell values , e.g. @xmath21 and @xmath22 , when going to the operator formalism .",
    "the model under consideration has no superpotential and hence @xmath23 . ]",
    "the constant @xmath6 is a fayet - iliopoulos parameter .",
    "the triplet @xmath24 transforms as a vector under @xmath25 rotations .",
    "the @xmath26 @xmath19 gauge connection @xmath27 is non - dynamical and thus neither appears in the supercharges nor in the hamiltonian .",
    "however , as is manifestly the case in the lagrangian formulation of this theory , the chiral fields are charged under @xmath27 , and therefore @xmath27 generates a gauss - law constraint , which will appear in the algebra below .",
    "the two - component chiral fermion @xmath28 and gaugino @xmath29 obey the canonical quantization conditions : @xmath30 we have borrowed the notation of @xcite where spinors with an index down transform in the @xmath31 of @xmath25 and spinors with an index up transform in the @xmath32 .",
    "indices are raised and lowered using the levi - civita symbol @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",

    "the hamiltonian is also invariant under the following discrete symmetry : @xmath70 which takes @xmath71 . as a result",
    "the spectrum is degenerate under the interchange @xmath72 , and we verify this explicitly in appendix [ wavefunceqs ] .",
    "this simple quantum mechanical model can be understood as the dimensional reduction of the worldvolume gauge theory living on a pair of wrapped d - branes in a calabi - yau compactification down to four dimensions .",
    "we consider here only the relative gauge group between the branes and ignore the `` center of mass '' degrees of freedom as they play no role in the study of the bound states .",
    "the vector muliplet scalars @xmath10 parametrize the separation between the d - branes in the non - compact space . furthermore , in our particular setup , the two branes intersect at a single point in the calabi - yau , where there exists a stretched string between them @xcite .",
    "the lightest string excitation is parametrized by the bifundamental charged chiral multiplet and the chiral scalar mass can be read off from the classical potential @xmath73 that is @xmath74  .",
    "the quantity @xmath75 should be understood as the difference between the phases of the complexified masses of the d - branes in the language of the calabi - yau compactification .",
    "thus , having neglected the tower of higher string modes , this model is only valid as an approximation to the d - brane system when @xmath76 and @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the the string length ( see @xcite for an in - depth discussion as well as @xcite for earlier references ) .    an important role is played by the fayet - iliopoulos parameter @xmath6 , which determines whether or not supersymmetry is broken , as is evidenced in ( [ potential ] ) . for @xmath79 there are two types of classical minima : the higgs branch with @xmath80 ( modulo @xmath19 gauge transformations ) , which preserves supersymmetry ; and the coulomb branch with @xmath81 , where supersymmetry is classically broken .",
    "the potential has a flat direction when @xmath82 for which @xmath83 .",
    "thus for @xmath79 the model is expected to have bound states with energies below this threshold value of @xmath84 .",
    "for @xmath85 there is no higgs branch and the coulomb branch is metastable for all values of @xmath86 .",
    "this picture changes drastically ( for @xmath79 ) when quantum effects are taken into consideration .",
    "if we are interested in the large distance behavior of the wavefunctions of this model , that is @xmath87 , then the chiral multiplet can be integrated out ( see appendix [ boapp ] ) generating an effective potential on the vector multiplet @xmath88 the new effective potential has a zero energy minimum at @xmath89 and supersymmetry is restored on the coulomb branch . for the coulomb branch description to be consistent",
    "we thus need @xmath90 or , restated in the language of the dimensionless parameter @xmath1 given in ( [ nu ] ) : @xmath91 for @xmath92 the bps wavefunction is localized on the higgs branch and the coulomb branch description is no longer valid . for @xmath1",
    "sufficiently large we expect the quiver description to break down and for supergravity to become the valid description @xcite .",
    "thus , in this model @xmath1 plays the role of the closed string coupling @xmath93 .",
    "since this model is a dimensionally reduced worldvolume gauge theory , the mass @xmath94 of the vector multiplet is related to the closed string coupling @xmath95 .",
    "it is our interest in this paper to study how the quantum states of this quiver model depend on @xmath1 . in quantum mechanics",
    "the higgs and coulomb branches are not fully separate , and the wavefunction will always have support in both directions .",
    "we aim to answer how the majority of the wavefunction s support moves from the @xmath96 direction to the @xmath86 direction as @xmath1 is increased . in order to study this",
    "we resort to numerically solving the full schrdinger equation and obtain supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric wavefunctions .",
    "this also serves as a numerical check of known supersymmetric index calculations @xcite . in doing",
    "so we also gain insight into the excited state spectrum of the theory and show how the gap with the first excited state depends on @xmath1 .",
    "we wish to diagonalize the maximal set of mutually commuting operators : @xmath97 and @xmath98  . before doing so , it is convenient to introduce the following parametrization for the chiral bosons : @xmath99 derivatives with respect to @xmath100 and @xmath101 are now given by @xmath102 and the gauss law generator becomes @xmath103 we will also find it convenient to work in spherical coordinates for the vector multiplet degrees of freedom , that is @xmath104",
    ". details on how operators are represented in spherical coordinates are given in appendix [ sphereapp ] .",
    "let us first attempt to solve the bps equations ( [ bpseqs ] ) for the ground state wavefunctions of this model .",
    "usually this would involve applying the supercharges to a generic state and looking for the normalizable solutions .",
    "it is to our advantage , however , that the refined supersymmetric index @xcite @xmath105 has been computed for this system and evaluates to @xmath106 when @xmath79 .",
    "as @xmath6 goes from negative to positive , @xmath12 jumps to zero and provides the simplest example of wall crossing @xcite . since @xmath12 is independent of @xmath107 there exists a single bosonic ground state with @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",

    "this has proven too difficult , so we instead solve for the ground state numerically . before moving on",
    "we note that ( [ hardschro ] ) is very much akin to the ` deprolongation ' of the bps equations noticed in @xcite , namely we can rewrite ( [ hardschro ] ) as @xmath133 where we have implicitly defined the differential operator @xmath134 and @xmath135      to construct the ground state wavefunction numerically , we will input the full schrdinger problem into the mathematica s ndeigensystem command .",

    "it turns out that @xmath141 satisfies the same wave equation as an @xmath142 state ( see for example ( [ hrm2 ] ) and ( [ hrp2 ] ) ) , hence states with vanishing @xmath141 have no superpartners in the @xmath142 sectors",
    ". the excited states with @xmath140 thus live in short multiplets , as described in appendix [ r0eqsapp ] .",
    "we also note here that the norm of the @xmath143 wavefunctions is given by @xmath144 however , we will have to restrict the domain of @xmath145 and @xmath146 when computing the eigenfunctions of ( [ j0ham ] ) numerically , and the wavefunctions will be normalized on this restricted domain .",
    "we are only interested in the case @xmath79 , since this is the phase with unbroken supersymmetry and relegate the study of @xmath6 positive to later work .",
    "the procedure is as follows , we input the differential operator ( [ j0ham ] ) into mathematica s ndeigensystem command , which uses a finite element approach to solve for the eigenfunctions of a coupled differential operator on a restricted domain .",
    "we vary the size of the domain and the refinement of the mesh until the numerics are stable .    before moving on",
    "we pause here to discuss the the subtlety of diagnosing supersymmetry breaking in the presence of numerical errors . that is , it is naively quite difficult to tell the difference between an _ actual _ zero energy eigenstate and one whose energy is lifted by supersymmetry breaking effects , especially when the algorithm s resolution of the energy is @xmath147 ( as it can be in certain parameter regimes ) .",
    "this is where being able to numerically determine the excited state spectrum comes in handy . to diagnose",
    "if supersymmetry is broken , it suffices to check that the state of interest lives in a supersymmetric multiplet and to find its susy partners .",

    "these systems have threshold bound states in the absence of fayet - iliopoulos parameters and we hope to report on whether numerics are useful in this scenario in a subsequent publication . another avenue is to study the states of mass deformed quiver theories recently described in @xcite , which represent the effective dynamics of wrapped branes in ads .",
