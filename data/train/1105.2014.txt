    "the characteristic harmonic oscillator frequencies @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) of each lattice site vary smoothly with the position of the lattice site modifying the lamb - dicke and interaction parameters .",
    "the variation of the trapping frequencies is obtained from the lattice potential @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the lattice spacing , @xmath13335  @xmath49 m is the beam waist , and @xmath134 and @xmath135 are the lattice depths .",
    "we extract the characteristic harmonic oscillator frequencies of a given site by expanding the lattice potential at the center of it . assuming a uniform occupation of the sites in the center of the lattice",
    ", we transform the spatial integration into an integration over the relevant range of trapping frequencies weighted by the number of sites with such trapping frequencies . for each set of trapping frequencies ,",
    "a thermal average is carried out over both the harmonic oscillator modes and lattice vibrational modes .",
    "this procedure is significantly simplified by noting that the main correction of the spatial average comes from the changes in the interaction terms .",
    "thus , changes in the rabi frequencies are accounted for only by using an average value , allowing us to transform the integration over trapping frequencies into an integration over interaction strengths .",
    "we have restricted so far our analysis to an effective one - dimensional system with at most two atoms per tube . for more than two atoms per tube",
    "the spin model is no longer diagonal in the collective spin basis , since the spin hamiltonian is not su(2 ) symmetric .",
    "this implies that for more than two atoms and outside the weakly interacting regime our calculations are not exact .",
    "however , we have performed numerical calculations for up to five atoms per tube that show that the two - atom model can qualitatively predict the many - atom case , but with renormalized interaction parameters .    in the 1-d lattice",
    "there are two weakly confined directions and multiple atoms per lattice site . under these conditions , interaction - induced mode - changing collisions , which are not accounted for in our two - atom model @xcite , have to be included .",
    "we have studied the role of those processes by numerical evaluation of a more general multi - mode hamiltonian and found that it mainly leads to a renormalization of the model parameters .",
    "all of these considerations justify the validity of the two - atom model for the description of the 1-d lattice .",
    "we use short ramsey pulses ( @xmath55ms ) to avoid interaction effects during the pulse .",
    "however , for pulses shorter than the mean oscillation period in the trap , @xmath56 with @xmath57 the weakest trap direction , and laser - induced mode - changing collisions ( not included in the two - atom model ) are not necessarily suppressed . to explore the role of laser - induced mode - changing collisions , we measured the collision shift as function of excitation fraction in the 2-d lattice for various pulse durations .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig4 ] , we varied the pulse time @xmath4 by one order of magnitude but found no substantial change in the measured shifts . thus we conclude that these processes do not play an important role ."

    "<S> , we can ignore interaction effects during the pulses . during the ramsey dark time </S>",
    "<S> , the hamiltonian describing the atom dynamics is diagonal in the singlet - triplet basis , and each state acquires just a phase . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , after the second pulse is applied , we recover ramsey fringes with a frequency shift . to compare with the 2-d lattice experiment , the shift must be integrated over the atomic distribution within an array of singly and doubly occupied lattice sites </S>",

    "<S> the deviation from a zero - crossing at exactly 0.5 in the 1-d case is consistent with a small @xmath51 interaction ( @xmath52 , with @xmath53  @xmath54 and @xmath54 the bohr radius ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we investigated tunneling effects by measuring the shifts for both vertically and horizontally oriented 1-d lattices , exploiting gravity - induced suppression of the tunneling rate @xcite , but we observed no change in the data ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the tunneling rate , thermally averaged over the lowest nine bands of the 1-d horizontal lattice , to be several hertz . in the vertical 1-d lattice and the 2-d lattice , </S>",
    "<S> this rate is suppressed by more than a factor of ten due to the energy offset between adjacent sites ( arising from gravity @xcite and the gaussian beam profile ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the two highest bands of the lattice , which are populated with a few percent of the atoms , can have very high tunneling rates ( several kilohertz ) that are not suppressed by the energy offset . </S>",
    "<S> because of this , the fraction of atoms that can tunnel during the spectroscopic time are 10  @xmath31 , 5  @xmath31 , and 10  @xmath31 for the horizontal , vertical , and 2-d lattices , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we do not see any appreciable difference between the shifts measured in the horizontal and vertical lattices and thus conclude that tunneling does not play a significant role in the collision shifts .    </S>",
    "<S> we use short ramsey pulses ( @xmath55  ms ) to avoid interaction effects during the pulse . </S>",
    "<S> but , for pulses shorter than the mean oscillation period in the trap , @xmath56 , with @xmath57 the weakest trap direction , and laser - induced mode - changing collisions are not necessarily suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we ruled out the relevance of those processes by varying the pulse duration over a factor of ten without observing any substantial modification to the measured collision shifts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we looked for dependence of the collision shifts on the second pulse area @xcite , but found no significant dependencies .    to further rule out @xmath1-wave interactions , we misaligned the probe beam to couple more strongly to the weak confinement axis of the lattice trap ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> doing so introduces greater excitation inhomogeneity from the ramsey pulse ( in this case , up to a factor of 2.4 ) because the atoms are not tightly confined along this axis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we expect the @xmath1-wave shift to depend quadratically on the inhomogeneity , yet the frequency shifts show no such dependence . </S>",
    "<S> this insensitivity is well explained by @xmath0-wave interactions , which depend only weakly on inhomogeneity at these levels ( decreasing slightly as more population transfers to the singlet state ) . </S>",
    "<S> a small but non - zero @xmath1-wave interaction could balance this effect and may help explain the complete lack of dependence , as shown in the theory curves in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the green long - dashed lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a , b ) also show that adding a small but non - zero @xmath1-wave interaction is consistent with the observed collision shifts . </S>",
    "<S> still , all of these considerations indicate that @xmath0-wave interactions play the dominant role in the cold collisions of @xmath3yb .    </S>",
    "<S> strong interactions emerge in the regime @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> a key observation revealing the operation of the 2-d lattice clock in the regime @xmath59 is the zero - crossing of the collision shift at a lower excitation fraction of 0.4 , which deviates from the crossing at 0.5 predicted by the weakly interacting expression of the shift @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction strength also introduces additional dependencies on the ramsey dark time . with weak interactions , </S>",
    "<S> the collision shift is independent of @xmath5 , but with strong interactions the clock shift decays with increasing @xmath5 due to the shift s sinusoidal dependence on scattering phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we investigated this experimentally by varying the dark time @xmath5 and measuring collision shifts in the 1-d lattice ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) ) , where the shift scales weakly with @xmath5 , and the 2-d lattice ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(c ) ) , where the shift is strongly damped towards zero with increasing @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> yet a third signature of strong interactions is significant asymmetry in the clock transition spectrum . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(d ) we show a rabi spectrum ( @xmath60  ms ) , taken under high density operation in the 2-d lattice , which shows an additional feature on the red side ( @xmath61 ) of resonance . </S>",
    "<S> this asymmetry is density - dependent and barely observable in the 1-d lattice . in the 2-d lattice , </S>",
    "<S> the interactions are sufficiently strong ( @xmath62 ) to introduce these asymmetric lineshape features beyond the transition linewidth . with yet higher density </S>",
    "<S> , it may be possible to spectrally resolve three features , one each for the @xmath1-wave - interacting singlet , the @xmath0-wave - interacting triplets , and the non - interacting atoms in singly occupied lattice sites . </S>",
    "<S> interaction - induced sidebands were recently reported in @xcite and may be useful for quantum simulation applications .    in this letter we have shown evidence for @xmath0-wave interactions in ultracold yb confined in an optical lattice . </S>",
    "<S> although lower atomic temperature yields reduced tunneling through the @xmath0-wave barrier , and thus a lower scattering cross - section , it also increases the atomic density of the confined atoms . for this reason , both @xmath1- and @xmath0-wave interactions may be potentially relevant for all optical lattice clock systems . using the dependence of the measured shift on excitation fraction and ramsey dark time , we have observed zero - crossings in the measured frequency shifts , which provide the metrological means to reduce the shifts to nearly negligible levels .    </S>",
