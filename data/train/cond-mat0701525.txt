    "multiple scattering of electrons and photons in disordered systems gives rise to many important physical effects , including anderson localization , quantum corrections to conductivity , localization - induced metal - insulator transitions , and coherent backscattering  @xcite .",
    "effects of disorder are most strongly exhibited in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems .",
    "the combination of localized resonances and bandgaps in randomly layered samples opens up fresh opportunities for applications and allows for detailed studies of slow light and other anomalous group velocity effects as well as the enhanced attenuation associated with the long path length of localized photons . due to the ease of fabrication",
    ", there are many potential applications for ordered and disordered millimeter wave dielectrics , including fundamental physics studies which can exploit the long dwell times associated with localized photons .    in this paper",
    ", we describe observations of anderson localization , enhanced absorption , and slow light in millimeter waves propagating in a random dielectric .",
    "specifically , we utilize 100-layer dielectric stacks of quartz and teflon wafers randomly shuffled like a deck of cards .",
    "the behavior of wave propagation in this system is a mixture of band gaps in which the random dielectric becomes an almost perfect reflector , resonances which are associated with anomalously high transmission , localized electric field inside the layered system , and enhanced absorption .",
    "the block diagram of our experiment is shown in fig .  [ fig_setup ] .",
    "a key aspect of our work is that we achieve these disorder - induced defects in a finite system which is only about four times the localization length .",
    "such finite size considerations are vital in quantum studies of disorder - induced phenomena in quantum degenerate ultracold atoms  @xcite .",
    "there are several approaches to experimental realization of 1d systems .",
    "recently , dielectric multilayer @xcite and single mode structures @xcite have been used to study localization in optical and microwave systems .",
    "however , millimeter waves offer several advantages .",
    "first , we can measure both amplitude and phase of the reflected and transmitted fields simultaneously .",
    "second , our setup is free - space and quasi - optical , so the attenuation in the waveguide is minimized .",
    "unlike previous work on photonic crystals and optical resonators where superluminal and slow light have also been observed @xcite , we induce these effects via disorder .",
    "ideally , a system would have sufficiently low attenuation that both the reflection and transmission response of a disordered system could be measured ; would allow for amplitude and phase of the reflected and transmitted signal to be measured simultaneously ; have large enough bandwidth that a number of band - gaps and resonances could be studied for each sample ; and would allow for easy fabrication of samples , so that many could be investigated quickly .",
    "all these requirements are met by our quasi - optical millimeter wave system .",
    "our article is outlined as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] , the experimental set - up is described . in sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] the transmission and reflection data are presented . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , the effective cavity model is derived . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , the experimental data of sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] are compared both to the effective cavity model and to simulations obtained from a propagator matrix . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we conclude .",
    "our layered dielectric samples consist of stacks of 300 - 400 @xmath0 m thick wafers of fused quartz and teflon held together tightly in a telescope tube with retaining rings .",
    "these disks are stock items for teflon and semiconductor manufacturers and are available at relatively low cost . with our millimeter wave vector network analyzer ,",
    "a scan over the entire w - band ( 75 - 110 ghz ) at 5000 frequency points takes only a few minutes .",
    "our setup allows for high signal - to - noise measurement of both reflected and transmitted e - fields simultaneously .",
    "the electric field is a linearly polarized gaussian beam whose diameter is much smaller than that of the wafers ; the beam strikes the dielectric stack perpendicularly , allowing a 1d treatment .",
    "quartz and teflon are low loss materials at millimeter wave frequencies and provide a reasonable dielectric contrast .",
    "the real part of the dielectric constants are measured to be @xmath1 for quartz and @xmath2 for teflon ; these values , obtained by fitting the transmission data for homogeneous samples with a fabry - perot model , are quite close to reference values ( 3.8 and 2.1 , respectively  goldsmith ) .",
    "the same fitting procedure gives loss tangents of @xmath3 for quartz and @xmath4 for teflon .",
    "such small loss tangents are difficult to measure with our setup and are less accurately specified .",
    "the micrometer - measured thicknesses of our individual wafers are @xmath5 mm for quartz and @xmath6 mm for teflon .",
    "however , even though the wafers are held tightly in the telescope tube , inevitably there are small air gaps between the wafers .",
    "this ultimately limits our ability to fit the data .",
    "the measurements were performed with a vector network analyzer developed by ab millimetre .",
    "the millimeter waves are generated by a sweepable centimeter wave source , i.e. , microwaves , in this case from 8 - 18 ghz .",
    "for work in the w - band these centimeter waves are harmonically multiplied by schottky diodes , coupled into a waveguide , and eventually radiated into free space by a scalar horn .",
    "these are also known as corrugated horns and have the property that when the te01 rectangular waveguide mode is coupled into the circular horn , a hybrid mode is established which has no cross - polarization .",
    "this results in the e - field being vertically polarized in a single - mode gaussian beam.@xcite .",
    "a polyethylene lens collimates the beam .",
    "the random dielectric stack is placed in the focal plane of the quasi - optical system . the transmitted field",
    "is then collected by an identical lens / horn combination , detected by a schottky harmonic detector and fed to a vector receiver which mixes the centimeter waves down to more easily manageable frequencies where the signal is digitized .",
    "reflected waves are also collected by the transmitting horn and routed via a circulator and isolator to the vector receiver",
    ". the source and receiver local oscillators are phase - locked .",
    "a more complete description of the system is given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in fig .  [ fig_trans ] , we illustrate the transmission and reflection spectra for the w - band as investigated experimentally and theoretically for a representative sample . plotted",
    "are the transmission coefficient ( @xmath7 ) and one minus the reflection coefficient ( r ) .",
    "the actual data collection requires careful calibration of the system , in the instrument response and in all phase shifts in the cables and waveguide .",
    "first , one sweeps over the band of frequencies with no sample present ; this gives a calibration e - field @xmath8 measured for transmission .",
    "second , one sweeps with a `` perfect '' reflector , i.e. , a polished metal plate , at the focal plane ; this gives a calibration e - field @xmath9 .",
    "finally , with a sample in place , the sweep returns the amplitude and phase due to the presence of the sample relative to a flat instrument response .",
    "so , in fig .",
    "[ fig_trans ] , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the reflection and transmission coefficients , respectively",
    ".    the theoretical curve in fig .  [ fig_trans ] is obtained by solving maxwell s equations numerically using the standard propagator matrix approach  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to compute the amplitude and phase of the reflected and transmitted fields as well as the fields everywhere inside the sample . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig_trans ] , most frequencies lie in disorder - induced band - gaps , where the reflection coefficient is near unity . between band - gaps",
    "there are narrow resonances accompanied by greatly enhanced transmission .",
    "off - resonance transmission losses , e.g. , around 80 and 94 ghz in figure [ fig_trans ] , are about 1% .    we observe in fig .  [ fig_trans ]",
    "differences in both amplitude and frequency between the measured and calculated spectra . in order to understand this effect , we studied periodic systems ( data not shown ) , and found that the fit was better .",
    "we also studied many different random samples and did not find any systematic amplitude and frequency shifts .",
    "we conclude that these shifts are likely a random effect of the tiny , unmeasurable air gaps between wafers as well as of small random variations in the thicknesses of the wafers .    from the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_trans ] , the localization length @xmath12 can be estimated .",
    "indeed , it is well known that the lyapunov exponent , @xmath13 is a self - averaging quantity  @xcite .",
    "that is , its fluctuations are small and its variance tends to zero , so that @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the sample length and @xmath16 is the spatial absorption rate @xcite .",
    "thus , at large @xmath15 the lyapunov exponent @xmath17 is close to @xmath18 with high probability , i.e. , in almost all samples , or at almost all frequencies in one sample .",
    "we call such off - resonance samples and frequencies _ typical_.    in fig .",
    "[ fig_trans ] , we find that @xmath19 at typical frequencies is approximately @xmath20 .",
    "the measured loss tangents of quartz and teflon correspond to absorption lengths of approximately 35 cm for quartz and 100 cm for teflon .",
    "the reciprocal absorption length is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the index of the homogeneous material and @xmath24 is the free - space wavelength of the probing beam .",
    "the absorption lengths of both quartz and teflon are much larger than the sample itself .",
    "thus , we find for our 42 mm sample the localization length @xmath25 mm .",
    "since @xmath26 , its influence on typical transmission frequencies is negligible , @xmath27 we reserve discussion of the atypical , or _ resonant _ case to secs .  [",
    "sec : theory ] and  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig_trans ] , the sum of the reflection and transmission coefficients drops noticeably at the resonances .",
    "this means that absorption plays a significant role ; in the presence of absorption , standard analytical treatments  @xcite fall short .",
    "therefore , we take advantage of an effective cavity model recently introduced by bliokh et al .  @xcite as follows . in the random medium of our sample ,",
    "the transmission coefficient at typical frequencies determines the localization length via eq .",
    "( [ eqn : localizationlength ] ) and so can be measured . however , along with the typical frequencies there are _ resonant _ frequencies .",
    "these are relatively rare , or low probability frequencies at which resonances occur , and the effect of absorption is dramatic . in these resonances ,",
    "photons become partially trapped by multiple scattering . in effect , the random multiple scattering gives rise to an effective cavity within the sample .",
    "the long dwell time of these photons is responsible for the enhanced attenuation . in other words ,",
    "the attenuation increases significantly at a resonance because the energy absorbed at each point is proportional to the intensity of the field , which is exponentially large throughout the resonant cavity .",
    "therefore , both the reflection and transmission coefficients decrease sharply even when the absorption length @xmath16 is much larger than the total length @xmath15 of the sample .",
    "one can treat any particular localized state as an effective cavity mode . using the measurable reflection and transmission coefficients on and off resonance together with the measurable resonance width",
    ", one can make a fit to determine the location and width of the effective cavity , as well as an effective absorption length .",
    "consider a random sample as a 1d resonator built of a cavity of length @xmath28 bounded by two barriers of lengths @xmath29 and @xmath30 , whose transmission coefficients are @xmath31 with @xmath32 the localization length",
    ". the parameters of the effective cavity will be different for each resonance inside the same sample .",
    "we take as our starting point the resonant transmission and reflection coefficients and resonant width , which can be shown to be @xmath33 respectively , where @xmath34 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath35 is the average real part of the dielectric constant and @xmath36 is the resonance width . here",
    "@xmath37 where @xmath16 is the effective absorption length such that the intensity @xmath38 decays as @xmath39 in an ordinary random sample , and the total length of the sample is @xmath40    first , we determine the effective cavity length @xmath28 . by definition , @xmath41substituting eq .",

    "this gives rise to a transmitted e - field phase that is nearly independent of frequency at the band - edge .",
