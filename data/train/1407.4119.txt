    "a crucial constraint on models of star cluster formation is the star formation duration which reveals itself as the age spread of stars in clusters .",

    "nevertheless , cluster star age spreads seem to range from a fraction of a million years up to 10 million years @xcite .",
    "based on such a variety of results , one may conclude that different star cluster formation mechanisms exist .",
    "building on the concept of star formation efficiency per free - fall time , we will show that this is not necessarily the case .",
    "the star formation efficiency per free - fall time , first defined by @xcite , is the gas mass fraction of an object turned into stars over one free - fall time at the object mean density . @xcite",
    "recently generalized the concept by associating a _ radially - varying _ free - fall time to the observed volume density profile of proto - cluster clumps .",
    "note that their model applies to molecular clumps ( i.e. , star cluster progenitors ) and not to molecular clouds ( i.e. , cluster complex progenitors ) . in this class of models , molecular gas with a higher volume density forms stars more rapidly than gas with a low volume density",

    ". under the assumption of a constant star formation efficiency per free - fall time , the slope predicted for the star formation relation , namely the relation between the surface densities in molecular gas and young stars , actually matches that observed by @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the star formation efficiency per free - fall time is independent of the distance from the clump center , hence from the gas density .",
    "such a conclusion agrees with the earlier result of @xcite who found no significant variations of the star formation efficiency per free - fall time over three orders of magnitude in gas density , from giant molecular clouds to hcn - traced molecular clumps .",
    "here we take the model of @xcite one step further and we show that high - density molecular clumps may yield clusters with shorter stellar age spreads than those formed by low - density clumps .",
    "our study has been stimulated by the recent finding that stellar age spreads in the central regions of the starburst clusters ngc3603  yc and westerlund  1 ( wd  1 ) may be an order of magnitude smaller than in the orion nebula cluster @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "we call age spread of a cluster the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of its stellar age distribution , regardless of the shape of the age distribution .",

    "their size  of order 1pc  and masses  up to @xmath20  make them cluster - progenitor candidates .",
    "in addition , the absence of mid - ir tracers of ongoing star formation ( either class  i young stellar objects or warm dust ) lead @xcite to consider these clumps as starless .",
    "an alternative model is that a cluster - forming clump is contracting from volumes with radius @xmath21pc over timescales of several myr during which star formation is already proceeding .",
    "the key difference between both models resides in the evolution of the star formation rate .",
    "while our model predicts a decrease with time of the star formation rate ( see below ) , a contracting clump leads to a star formation rate increase .",
    "a third possibility is that the actual star formation history of molecular clumps consists of the combination of both models , with an increasing star formation rate during the contraction of the clump followed by a decline once stellar feedback has forced the clump to a position of near - equilibrium .",
    "such a scenario inevitably leads to star age distributions broader than those derived here .    in what follows ,",
    "we assume that the clump radius @xmath15 remains constant in time .",
    "such a static configuration may be maintained as protostellar outflows compensate for the decay of the turbulence inherited from the clump formation , thereby allowing the clump to resist a global gravitational contraction .",
    "collimated protostellar outflows are especially efficient at transporting the outflow momentum and energy to large distances , eventually driving the turbulence on the full pc - scale of the cluster - forming clump ( @xcite ; see @xcite for an early model ) .",

    "shallower density profiles lead to longer half - life times . ) therefore , the denser the cluster - parent clump , the shorter the half - life time of its star formation rate and the shorter the stellar age spread of the resulting cluster .",
    "caution should be taken , however , as the fwhm of the age distribution does not depend only on the half - life time of the star formation rate .",
    "firstly , star - age binning may prevent a short half - life time from being resolved in the intrinsic age distribution .",
    "this is the case encountered for our densest model clump ( model  a ) .",
    "secondly , uncertainties in the age of individual stars inflate the measured age spread . in case of a very dense ",
    "fastly - evolving ",
    "clump , the measured age spread embodies mostly the star age uncertainty and loses memory of the short star formation rate half - life time .",
    "therefore , these two effects  large age - bin size and age uncertainties  weaken the contrast between the measured age spread for high- and low - density clumps ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sum ] , top panel ) .    the predicted effect that high - density clumps give rise to narrower age spreads seems to have been observed , with the fwhm of the stellar age distribution in the central regions of the high - density clusters ngc3603  yc and wd",
    "1 found to be an order of magnitude smaller than for the orion nebula cluster ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for the central regions of the young starburst cluster wd  1 , @xcite derived a fwhm of 0.4myr .",
    "they estimated a photometric error contribution of 0.25 myr . assuming that the observed fwhm is the quadratic sum of the age error and of the intrinsic fwhm , we derive @xmath199myr .",
    "this value agrees well with what we found for clump  b ( see top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sum ] ) .",
    "we therefore suggest that the central regions of wd  1 formed out of gas with a density of the order of @xmath200 if @xmath87 .    matching a cluster age spread to the density of its parent clump",
    "can be done by using the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sum ] .",
    "it provides the relation between the half - life time and the mean volume density of molecular clumps with an @xmath201-density profile when @xmath1 .",
    "observers can build on it to predict the relation between the clump mean density and the fwhm of the stellar age distribution they would measure for their own age - bin size and uncertainties in stellar ages .",
    "it can also be rescaled to another @xmath27-value : lower efficiencies lead to higher gas densities for given fwhms .",
    "if the star formation efficiency per free - fall time is lower than 0.1 , the evolution is slower .",
    "this implies that to achieve a given age spread @xmath119 , the free - fall time of the gas must be shorter ( to compensate for the slower @xmath0 ) and , therefore , the gas density must be higher . as an example , if an intrinsic age spread @xmath119 is achieved by a clump of mean density @xmath139 with @xmath36 , the same age spread is achieved by a clump of mean density @xmath202 if @xmath203 .",
    "but what if the star formation rate decreases so slowly that its half - life time can not be defined ? if the star formation efficiency per free - fall time is as low as @xmath2 , it takes about 10 clump free - fall times for the star formation rate to decrease to half its initial value ( again assuming an isothermal density profile ) . therefore ,",
    "if the star formation duration is shorter than that , the half - life time can not be defined , and the fwhm of the intrinsic star age distribution is driven by the duration of the star formation episode @xmath120 ( e.g. bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ad ] ) . to estimate",
    "@xmath120 requires a detailed understanding of how long it takes for stellar feedback processes to terminate star formation inside the clump , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "yet , we have shown that building on the invariance of the shape of the _ young _ cluster mass function can help us reach some conclusions . that the shape of the cluster mass function does not change with time at young ages points to a mass - invariant star formation efficiency and , therefore , to a duration of star formation equal to a given number of free - fall times for all cluster - forming clumps .",
    "therefore , in this case too , we reach the conclusion that the @xmath119 scales with the clump free - fall time @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath204 . again , denser clumps give rise to narrower star age distributions .",
    "the normalisation of the @xmath139-@xmath119 relation depends on how many free - fall times star formation lasts .",
    "we have also searched the literature for the age spreads and densities of observed star - forming regions .",
    "we find that current data support a scenario where the characteristic time - scale of star formation is of order @xmath4-@xmath5 , which is reminiscent of the earlier study by @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : litdat ] ) . note that the @xmath118-axis of fig .",
    "[ fig : litdat ] often refers to the observed fwhm of the stellar age distribution . in our model , it reflects the half - life time @xmath86 of the star formation rate .",
    "as such , the fwhm is not representative of the duration of star formation which can be significantly longer .",
    "the key conclusion of our work is that the observation in young clusters of stellar age spreads spanning 1-to-2 orders of magnitude @xcite does not require different cluster - formation mechanisms @xcite .",
    "this may simply reflect the wide range of volume densities among cluster - forming clumps .",
    "our work also suggests that the intrinsic star age spread in clusters may constitute a promising probe into the mean volume density of their gaseous progenitors , provided that the star formation efficiency per free - fall time is well - constrained .",
