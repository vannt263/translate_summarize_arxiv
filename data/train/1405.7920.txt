    "in the context of classical field theories , structures possessing topologically nontrivial profiles are usually described as the static solutions of the euler - lagrange equations in the presence of finite energy boundary conditions @xcite . in some special cases , by requiring the minimization of the corresponding energy functional , such structures can also be described via a set of first - order differential equations also known as bps  equations @xcite , which provide genuine solutions of the euler - lagrange ones .",

    "expressing @xmath48  and @xmath49  in terms of @xmath63  gives very long expressions , when possible .",

    "<S> we have established a prescription for the calculation of analytical vortex solutions in the context of generalized maxwell - higgs models whose overall dynamics is controlled by two positive functions of the scalar field , namely @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also determined a natural constraint between these functions and the higgs potential @xmath2 , allowing the existence of axially symmetric bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) solutions possessing finite energy . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , when the generalizing functions are chosen suitably , the nonstandard bps equations can be solved exactly . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied some examples , comparing them with the usual abrikosov - nielsen - olesen ( ano ) solution . </S>",
    "<S> the overall conclusion is that the analytical self - dual vortices are well - behaved in all relevant sectors , strongly supporting the generalized models they belong themselves . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , our results mimic well - known properties of the usual ( numerical ) configurations , as localized energy density , while contributing to the understanding of topological solitons and their description by means of analytical methods . </S>"
