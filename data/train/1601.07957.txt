    "semiclassical physics emerged during the development of quantum mechanics , almost one century ago , to account for the transition from wave physics in the quantum regime to classical mechanics @xcite .",
    "today , semiclassical physics plays an essential role in quantum chaos @xcite , and its methods are applied in virtually any field that features wave dynamics , including acoustics @xcite , electromagnetism @xcite , hydrodynamics @xcite , and loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate the power of these methods when applied to optical microresonators by studying square - shaped polymer - based microlasers .",
    "their emission properties are little understood for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the square resonator with dirichlet boundary conditions is a standard example of a separable system , whereas the dielectric square resonator is nonseparable and hence nonintegrable due to the diffraction at the dielectric corners .",
    "this remains an open problem in mathematical physics with tremendous impact on radar or telecommunication applications @xcite .",
    "secondly , it was observed that these lasers emit very narrow lobes in only a few directions .",
    "directional emission from microlasers has been intensely investigated due to possible applications @xcite and observed for , e.g. , limaon- and stadium - shaped microlasers .",
    "the underlying mechanism is understood in terms of their chaotic ray dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , these explanations can not be applied to polygonal resonators since they do not exhibit chaotic ray dynamics .",
    "while square and hexagonal microresonators and have been extensively studied , their far - field distributions have been scarcely investigated @xcite .",
    "this is partly because rounded corners significantly influence the resonance frequencies and field distributions @xcite , and it is technologically challenging to fabricate sharp corners . here",
    "we investigate the far - field emission of microlasers with sharp corners ( i.e. , with a radius of curvature much smaller than the wavelength ) . a semiclassical model for the dielectric square @xcite",
    "is used to predict the far - field distributions , which are in very good agreement with numerical calculations .",
    "careful comparison of the measured far - field distributions with the model allows to identify the lasing modes and understand the mechanism for their high directionality .",
    "the microlasers consisted of a pmma polymer matrix doped by @xmath0  wt% dcm laser dye that was deposited in a @xmath1  nm - thick layer on a si / sio@xmath2 ( @xmath3 m ) wafer by spin - coating .",
    "square cavities with side length ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath5 m were engraved by electron - beam lithography @xcite , which makes it possible to obtain two - dimensional cavities with nanoscale precision [ see ( a ) ] .",
    "the microlasers were pumped by a pulsed , frequency - doubled nd : yag laser ( @xmath6  nm , @xmath7  ns , @xmath8  hz ) .",
    "the short pulses and low duty cycle help to avoid problems from heating and quenching due to dark states .",
    "the pump beam impinged vertically and it covered the whole cavity uniformly the lasing emission was collected in the sample plane by a lens and transferred to a spectrometer by an optical fiber .",
    "it was polarized parallel to the sample plane .",
    "the far - field intensity distributions were measured as a function of the azimuthal angle @xmath9 by rotating the cavity .",
    "a typical spectrum is shown in .",
    "it features a sequence of equidistant peaks .",
    "its fourier transform ( right inset of ) shows that the free spectral range ( fsr ) of the spectrum corresponds to the optical length of the diamond orbit @xcite .",
    "therefore it is expected that the observed lasing modes are localized on trajectories with an angle of incidence close to @xmath10 .",
    "a typical far - field intensity distribution of a single resonance is presented in ( a ) .",
    "it exhibits four emission lobes in the directions parallel to the side walls .",
    "the emission lobes are very narrow with a full width at half maximum of about @xmath11 [ see ( b ) ] .",
    "figure [ fig : images](b ) shows an image of the lasing cavity taken by a camera with a high - magnification zoom lens .",
    "it evidences that the lasing emission ( red ) is emitted from the side walls parallel to the emission direction , whereas the side walls perpendicular to it do not emit but only scatter the green pump laser .",
    "since the emission is at a grazing angle , it must stem from rays impinging on the cavity side walls with an angle of incidence very close to the critical one , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the refractive index @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with the previous observation that the ray trajectories on which the lasing modes are based have an angle of incidence close to @xmath10 .",
    "the far - field distributions are calculated using the semiclassical model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to identify the observed lasing modes .",
    "the model is based on the observation that the wave functions are localized on classical tori and are thus composed of eight plane waves @xmath14 .",
    "their directions are related to each other by the symmetry operations of the @xmath15 point group .",
    "the corresponding ray trajectories in are given by the momentum vectors @xmath16 and their rotations by 90@xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "to quantize the spectrum , the simplest approach is to separate the system along the @xmath19 and @xmath20 directions , and write two phase loop conditions analogous to that of a fabry - prot cavity @xcite , @xmath21 the main difference from a fabry - prot cavity are the fresnel coefficients @xmath22 corresponding to an incidence with angles @xmath23 $ ] instead of @xmath24 .",
    "the momentum vector components @xmath25 can thus be formally written as @xmath26 \\ } / a \\ , , \\\\",
    "k_y & = & \\{\\pi m_y + i \\ln[r(\\alpha_y ) ] \\ } / a \\ , .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] the resonance wave number is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the free - space wavelength . note that @xmath29 are in general complex - valued .",
    "all wave functions @xmath30 are obtained by adding up the @xmath31 plane waves with their correct momentum vectors and signs . for transverse magnetic ( tm ) [ transverse electric ( te ) ] polarization ,",
    "the electric ( magnetic ) field is parallel to the plane of the cavity , and @xmath32 corresponds to the @xmath33 component of the electric ( magnetic ) field .",
    "the resonances [ i.e. , solutions of ] are labeled by their quantum numbers @xmath34 and their symmetries @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) with respect to the diagonal @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) means a symmetric ( antisymmetric ) wave function .",
    "there are six symmetry classes corresponding to the different combinations of @xmath42 and the quantum numbers that are labeled by the mulliken symbols @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( see ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     green s identity is used to infer the far - field distribution @xcite .",
    "the derivation is detailed in the supplementary materials along with the comparison to numerical simulations ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : specnum ] and [ fig : ffnum ] ) . the full expression for the far - field distribution of an @xmath46 mode",
    "is given in .",
    "it consists of @xmath31 terms like @xmath47 \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) for tm ( te ) polarization and @xmath50 .",
    "each such term corresponds to emission in the two directions @xmath51 defined by the roots of the argument of the @xmath52 function .",
    "if the angle of incidence of the corresponding rays inside the resonator is smaller than @xmath53 , then @xmath51 is simply given by snell s law ( see ) , and the emission lobe is called _",
    "refractive_. then the @xmath52 term is in fact the diffraction pattern of a plane wave going through a slit with a width @xmath54 that is the projection of the side of the square on the emission direction ( see ) . when @xmath51 is complex , corresponding to rays with angle of incidence larger than @xmath53 , the lobe is called _ nonrefractive _ and is emitted parallel to the side wall .",
    "the nonrefractive lobes are jagged and much broader .",
    "they have a much smaller amplitude than the refractive lobes due to the finite imaginary part of @xmath51 .",
    "while no energy is transmitted when a plane wave impinges on an infinite dielectric interface with an angle larger than the critical one ( i.e. , it is totally reflected ) , this is not the case for an interface of finite length as illustrated by the existence of the nonrefractive emission lobes @xcite , which leads to a modification of the reflection and transmission coefficients .",
    "two different cases of far - field diagrams can appear for @xmath55 , depending on @xmath56 . if @xmath57 , the plane waves impinging on a side wall with angle @xmath58 escape refractively , whereas those impinging with @xmath59 are totally reflected .",
    "hence @xmath31 refractive and @xmath31 nonrefractive lobes are observed , where the latter are typically negligible compared to the former . if @xmath60 , all plane waves are totally reflected , and @xmath61 nonrefractive lobes are observed , though their directions are four - fold degenerate .",
    "we now compare the model with experiments . a spectrum generated by the model and corresponding to the experimental conditions",
    "is shown in .",
    "the resonances are arranged in branches .",
    "each of them consists of modes with identical longitudinal quantum number @xmath62 and increasing transverse quantum number @xmath63 as @xmath58 decreases @xcite .",
    "the horizontal distance between these branches agrees well with the experimentally observed fsr , corresponding to the length of the diamond orbit .",
    "therefore we conclude that the observed lasing resonances belong to different branches , i.e. , each has a different @xmath64 .",
    "we use the far - field intensity distributions to infer @xmath58 and thus their transverse quantum numbers .",
    "the model far - field patterns of three representative modes are presented in .",
    "they are labeled by ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) in .",
    "mode ( c ) is located just below the critical angle ( @xmath65 ) and features two refractive emission lobes between @xmath66 and @xmath67 , while its nonrefractive lobes are not visible due to their negligible amplitude . since the measured far - field patterns feature only @xmath68 lobes in the total range of @xmath69 , such modes with @xmath57 can be excluded .",
    "mode ( b ) with @xmath70 is located just above the critical angle .",
    "the refractive lobes have become nonrefractive and merged into four narrow lobes parallel to the sides .",
    "this is precisely the kind of far - field pattern observed experimentally .",
    "mode ( a ) finally is well above the critical angle ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the nonrefractive lobes have become very broad and jagged unlike what was observed experimentally .",
    "also their amplitude has decreased significantly .",
    "this development continues with increasing @xmath58 .",
    "the qualitative comparison with the measured far - field intensity distribution shows that the experimental lasing modes are only consistent with mode ( b ) , i.e. , an angle of incidence just above the critical angle .",
    "this is confirmed by the fits described in the following .",
    "the experimental far - field distribution measured with an angular resolution of 1@xmath17 as in is compared to the envelope of the model far - field distributions .",
    "this is detailed in the supplementary materials .",
    "the only two independent parameters are the amplitude and @xmath58 , which is considered a continuous variable due to the high resonance density .",
    "the fit of the lobe yields @xmath72 and is plotted in ( b ) .",
    "the agreement is excellent .",
    "similar results are obtained for the other lobes and the other resonances as well as squares with various sizes , yielding values of @xmath73 from @xmath74 to @xmath75 . as expected from the qualitative considerations in the previous paragraph and the photograph in ( b ) , the angle of incidence is slightly above the critical angle .",
    "in fact , the model predicts far - field distributions with a very quickly oscillating substructure that stems from the terms in the square brackets in , namely the @xmath76 and @xmath77 functions with the argument @xmath78 .",
    "the actual model far - field intensity distribution for the fitted parameters is shown as thin green line in ( b ) . to confirm this prediction , the angular resolution of the setup",
    "was improved by putting a slit in front of the collection lens .",
    "the far - field intensity distribution measured this way is shown in the inset of ( b ) .",
    "it features oscillations with a period of @xmath79 , while the expected period is @xmath80 according to .",
    "the agreement is excellent for different wavelengths and cavity sizes .",
    "systematic measurements with increased angular resolution will allow for a better determination of the symmetry of the lasing resonances .",
    "furthermore , the symmetry of the far - field distributions can be changed by the polarization of the pump laser due to the fluorescence anisotropy of the laser dye @xcite : when the square microlaser is pumped with linear polarization parallel to the @xmath19 axis [ instead of circular polarization as in ( a ) ] , the emission is almost bidirectional with strong emission lobes at @xmath81 and @xmath82 , whereas the emission lobes at @xmath83 and @xmath84 are strongly suppressed ( not shown ) .",
    "this effect is a consequence of the lower degree of symmetry induced by the pump polarization .",
    "it can be explained by the formation of coherent superpositions of degenerate mode pairs like the @xmath85 and @xmath86 modes .",
    "it should be noted that the lasing modes and hence far - field emission of microlasers can also be controlled by localized or selective pumping @xcite , whereas controlling it only with the pump polarization is an experimentally simpler approach .",
    "these topics are , however , beyond the scope of this article and will be explored in a future publication .",
    "the far - field intensity distributions of square - shaped organic microlasers were investigated and revealed highly directional emission in the four directions parallel to the cavity sides .",
    "sharp corners were essential for obtaining this high directionality because rounded corners significantly change the emission behavior @xcite .",
    "analytical formulas for the far - field distributions based on a semiclassical model @xcite were developed and showed excellent agreement both with experimental data and with numerical simulations .",
    "they could be easily adapted to other polygonal cavities like hexagon or rectangles @xcite and other refractive indices .",
    "the comparison between the model and experiments evidences that the lasing modes are based on trajectories with an angle of incidence almost equal to the critical angle that hence leave the resonator at a grazing angle .",
    "interestingly , these modes do not feature the highest quality factors ; these would be modes with @xmath58 larger than @xmath53 .",
    "maybe these modes actually lase , but are not observed because of their lower amplitude in the far - field compared to other modes . or they may actually have higher losses due to diffraction at the substrate interface @xcite",
    ". the semiclassical model does not take into account diffraction by the corners , whereas it is precisely this effect which renders the system nonintegrable .",
    "while the model calculations agree very well with the observed spectrum and far - field distributions , there are some minor observations that can not be explained by them . for example",
    ", some light is emitted into other directions than the four main emission lobes due to diffraction at the corners , but it is much less intense .",
    "this means that diffraction by the corner plays a secondary , but not negligible role for the emission from polygonal microlasers .",
    "studying these effects would allow more insight into the open physical - mathematical problem of diffraction by a dielectric wedge .",
    "the numerical calculations are based on a code developed by c.  schmit .",
