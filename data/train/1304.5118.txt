    "the resonantly interacting fermi gas is characterized by strong interaction effects in the eos @xcite and reveals a unique universal thermodynamic behavior @xcite .",
    "so far , experiments on collective modes in harmonically trapped fermi gases have been restricted to a few elementary modes .",
    "the most simple modes , sloshing modes , do not provide any information on the properties of the quantum gas , and their main application is thus to accurately determine the trap frequencies .",
    "surface modes are insensitive to the eos , but they allow to clearly distinguish between hydrodynamic and collisionless behavior @xcite and they have been used to detect the angular momentum in a rotating fermi gas @xcite .",
    "elementary compression modes of axial @xcite and radial @xcite character have been very widely studied in the field .",
    "such modes do not only probe the particular collision regime , but they also give access to the compressibility of the gas",
    ". however , for a unitary fermi gas , the eigenfrequencies of the simple compression modes do not show any variation across the superfluid phase transition as the temperature is varied @xcite .",
    "this can be understood as a consequence of the fact that superfluid and collisional hydrodynamics both lead to the same frequencies . a rigorous proof for this temperature - independence can be given in terms of an exact scaling solution of the hydrodynamic equations of motion @xcite .",
    "the situation is strikingly different for higher - nodal modes . here",
    "the frequencies vary across the superfluid phase transition , when the dynamical regime changes from superfluid to collisional hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "such higher - nodal modes therefore represent an interesting addition to the experimental tool - box for probing strongly interacting fermi gases .",

    ", one can describe the thermodynamics and the flow properties of the trapped sample using effective 1d quantities , which are derived by integrating over the transverse degrees of freedom , such that a thermodynamic quantity @xmath2 yields a 1d counterpart @xmath3 .    for a first - sound collective mode with frequency @xmath4",

    "finally , using the equation of continuity under the 1d formulation @xmath42 , one can calculate the shape of the density oscillations for each mode .",
    "the starting point of our experiment is an ultracold , resonantly interacting fermi gas in an elongated optical dipole trap .",
    "this gas is prepared by evaporating a balanced mixture of fermionic @xmath43li atoms in their two lowest spin states at a magnetic field of 834 g , very close to the center of the well - known broad feshbach resonance  @xcite .",

    "the corresponding fermi temperatures @xmath51 vary between about @xmath52 and @xmath53k .    to achieve the lowest possible temperatures , we perform deep evaporative cooling up to the point where the trapping potential cuts slightly into the fermi sea , indicated by the onset of spilling losses in the last stage of the evaporation .",
    "after that , the gas is adiabatically recompressed by increasing the trapping beam s power to the extent where the trap depth becomes at least twice more than the fermi energy @xmath54 .",
    "this recompression step is essential to ensure negligible anharmonicities in the radial confinement .",
    "the essentially perfect harmonic confinement along the axial direction is ensured by the magnetic trapping that results from the curvature of the magnetic field used for feshbach tuning  @xcite .",
    "we vary the temperature @xmath55 of the gas by controlled heating , always starting from a deeply cooled cloud ( @xmath56 ) . in the low - temperature range ( @xmath57 ) , we simply introduce a variable hold time of up to 4s in which residual trap heating slowly increases the cloud s temperature . for the higher - temperature range ( @xmath58 ) , we heat the sample using parametric heating , modulating the trap power at about @xmath59 , and introducing a sufficient hold time to reach thermal equilibrium between the different degrees of freedom .",
    "we note that we use deeper traps for samples with higher @xmath37 , because plain evaporation puts a limit on the maximum attainable temperature of the gas .",
    "we determine the temperature @xmath55 of the gas by analyzing its density distribution in the trap , based on knowledge of the eos . under the local density approximation",
    ", one can readily show for a harmonic trap that the 1d density profile @xmath60 is given by  @xcite @xmath61 here , the universal function @xmath62 is related to the universal function @xmath30 introduced in sec .  [ sec : theory ] by @xmath63 , and is therefore also known from a given eos .",

    "( [ eqn : n1 ] ) . however , in reality we have to deal with imperfections of our absorption imaging scheme .",
    "to extract the temperature in an accurate way , we have adopted the methods described in detail in the appendix .",
    "we apply a resonant excitation scheme to create a collective oscillation .",
    "figure  [ figure : excitation_scheme](a ) illustrates the basic geometry of our scheme in which a repulsive 532-nm green laser beam perpendicularly intercepts the trapping beam . to excite a mode",
    ", we position the green beam near the antinode of the mode and modulate its power at the expected frequency of the mode . the amplitude , duration and shape of the modulation",
    "are carefully adjusted in order not to overdrive the excitation while maintaining sufficient signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we adopt an excitation pulse that contains 8 cycles of sinusoidal modulation with a half - cycle sine envelope @xcite , see illustration in fig .",
    "[ figure : excitation_scheme](b ) .",
    "we set the maximum barrier height of the green beam to about @xmath65 .",
    "depending on the order of the mode to be excited , this is realized with beam waists ranging from @xmath66 m to @xmath67 m and values of the maximum power @xmath68 between @xmath69w and 3mw .",
    "the 8-cycle pulse is chosen such that the resulting total excitation duration is not too long as compared to the damping time of the highest - nodal mode that we can observe .",
    "the smooth half - cycle sine envelope reduces the fourier width and avoids side lobes in the spectrum , thereby suppressing the excitation of unwanted modes . for an efficient excitation of a given mode",
    ", we find that the width of the green beam should well match the local mode profile at the selected antinode , while the excitation frequency should be within 1% of the actual mode frequency .",
    "once a collective mode is excited , we record the axial density profiles @xmath70 of the gas for a variable time delay @xmath71 after the excitation pulse , where @xmath70 is the number density integrated over the transverse degrees of freedom .",
    "these profiles are obtained with a probe beam that perpendicularly intercepts the trapping beam , and are taken 600@xmath36s after suddenly releasing the atoms from the optical trap  @xcite . to enhance the visibility",
    ", we subtract a background profile @xmath72 obtained from averaging the profiles over all measured delay times .",
    "this gives a differential density variation function @xmath73 , which is finally normalized to the maximum linear density @xmath74 at the trap center .",
    "in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ figure:3modes ] , we show examples of this signal for the @xmath21 , 2 , and 3 modes for the coldest samples with @xmath75 .",
    "one can see that the adjacent antinodes always oscillate in opposite directions , similar to standing waves on a guitar string .",
    "the first step to analyze the observed time - dependent profiles @xmath76 is a fourier transform , yielding a representation of our data in frequency space , @xmath77  @xcite . for this purpose",
    "we employ a fast fourier transform ( fft ) algorithm .",

    "the discrete nature in frequency space becomes evident , with very little noise in the background .",

    "the corresponding mode profiles for the @xmath21 , 2 , and 3 modes are shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ figure:3modes ] .",
    "experimentally , we make use of the mode profiles and the frequencies obtained in this way to optimize the beam waist and the modulation frequency in our excitation scheme .",
    "we proceed iteratively , which eventually allows for an optimum excitation of a single mode .",
    "to extract the mode frequencies more precisely than it is possible by simply analyzing the peaks in the corresponding fourier spectrum , we adopt the following algorithm . we project @xmath82 onto the mode profile @xmath78 to obtain a mode amplitude function @xmath83 .",
    "then we fit a simple damped harmonic oscillation to @xmath84 to obtain the frequency and the damping time of the mode .",
    "this projection procedure is analogous to the projection of a superposition wavefunction onto one of the orthogonal eigenstates of a quantum system .",
    "it greatly enhances the signal - to - noise ratio and results in very low statistical uncertainties for the mode frequencies , with relative uncertainties as low as in the range of a few permille .    in fig .",

    "we finally note that we have not succeeded in observing modes with @xmath86 , despite of considerable efforts .",
    "we believe that this is due to a fast increase of damping with the mode order , which is clearly indicated by our data for the @xmath87 modes .",

    "we do not fully understand the reason for this reduction , which is clearly related to the high density of the cloud , but it is not related to a ` black out ' effect , in which the imaging light is completely absorbed by a very dense cloud . in our case , the maximum optical density is about one , which can be properly accounted for by the exponential decrease of the transmission with increasing column density .",
    "we speculate that the underlying mechanism is related to multiple scattering of a photon by a few neighboring atoms when the atoms are very closely packed , thereby reducing the effective absorption cross section of the atoms . for our geometry",
    ", this effect should be important when the photon s ` mean free path ' becomes comparable to the radial size of the cloud , which is indeed the case for our experimental conditions .",
    "( color online ) apparent atom numbers obtained with different times of flight while keeping other experimental parameters unchanged . the red diamonds and the black circles represent the data sets with @xmath109 and @xmath110 atoms , respectively . ]    by analyzing profiles obtained for different times of flight we found that the imaging problem mainly affects the center of the cloud , where one finds the largest density .",
    "therefore the problem does not only result in smaller apparent atom numbers , but it also distorts the density distribution @xmath60 of the cloud as obtained by _ in - situ _ absorption imaging . to determine the temperature of the cloud in spite of this problem , we have adopted the two different methods described below .",
    "each method has its own systematic uncertainties .",
    "their accuracies can only be judged _ a posteriori _ by their mutual agreement and also by their agreement with certain theoretical predictions .",
    "both methods rely on the accuracy of the total atom number @xmath112 .",
    "we obtain this number through a very careful calibration of the imaging process and the imaging system . for imaging ,",
    "we typically adopt a 10-@xmath36s - long imaging pulse and keep the probe intensity less than 4% of the saturation intensity .",
    "these parameters keep the total number of photon scattering events per atom small , thereby minimizing the photon - recoil - induced doppler - detuning effect @xcite on the light @xmath43li atoms .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in the resulting atom number to be typically about 10% , in any case below 20% .",
    "typical fit to the wings of the 1d density distribution to determine @xmath37 from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : n1 ] ) .",
    "the filled circles represent the data used for fitting , and the solid line is the full profile according to the fit .",
    "the open circles represent the remaining data that were not used in the fit because of the problem to determine the correct linear density in the center of the cloud . here",
    "a tof of 600@xmath36s was applied , the total atom number is @xmath113 , and the temperature is @xmath114 . ]    in the first method , we obtain the cloud s temperature by fitting eq .",
    "( [ eqn : n1 ] ) to the wings of a 1d density profile taken after a 600@xmath36s tof @xcite , with @xmath112 determined independently from a corresponding 2-ms tof image . the wings , where @xmath60 is relatively small and the total absorption is weak , are essentially free of the image distortion as described above .",
    "an example for a typical wing fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wingfit ] .",
    "the figure also illustrates the difference between the true density profile as reconstructed by the wing fit ( solid line ) and the distorted observed one ( data points ) .",
    "in practice , we adjust the number of data points used for the wing fit until we obtain an atom number very close to the actual value obtained using a sufficiently long tof .",
    "sometimes , we have to use different numbers of data points in each wing when the profile on the wings is not fully symmetric .",
    "this issue is caused mainly by optical aberrations in the imaging system .",
    "nevertheless , we always find the same @xmath37 within an uncertainty of 10 to 15% using this procedure for samples prepared by the same experimental sequence .",
    "we also do not observe a clear deviation in the so obtained temperature when varying the tof from 0 to 600@xmath36s .",
    "our experience shows that the accuracy of @xmath37 obtained from this method is not very sensitive to slight distortions in the wing profiles .",
    "instead , it depends more crucially on the correct atom number @xmath112 .      in the second method",
    ", we characterize the temperature in a model - independent way that does not require any _ a priori _ knowledge of the eos .",
    "based on the virial theorem  @xcite we can obtain the total energy @xmath115 of the harmonically trapped cloud from its potential energy , which can be calculated from the 1d density profile @xmath60 according to @xmath116 .",
    "we define a dimensionless parameter @xmath117 , where @xmath115 is normalized to the energy of a noninteracting , zero - temperature fermi gas with the same number of atoms , @xmath118 .    to obtain an accurate value for @xmath117",
    "it is essential to have accurate knowledge of @xmath60 .",
    "here we overcome the above - discussed distortion problem by ` reconstructing ' the correct profile .",
    "we measure the density profiles of the cloud for two different times of flight , 600-@xmath36s and 2ms .",
    "the corresponding profiles @xmath119 and @xmath120 provide complementary information . while the 600-@xmath36s profile provides accurate information on the wings",
    ", it underestimates the central part of the cloud .",
    "in contrast , the 2-ms profile suffers in the wings from the expansion , but gives accurate information on the central part of the cloud . with an appropriate algorithm to combine this information",
    "we can reconstruct the full profile with reasonable accuracy .",
    "the reconstructed profile shows approximately the correct atom number and it maintains the wing distribution , which has large weights @xmath121 in the total energy @xmath115 .",
    "relation between @xmath117 and @xmath37 for a 3d harmonic trap .",
    "the solid and the dashed lines correspond to the results obtained using the eos from ref .",
    "@xcite and the eos of the non - interacting fermi gas , respectively . ]",
    "we can now convert @xmath117 into @xmath37 using the eos from ref .",
    "@xcite . using the universal thermodynamic relations of a resonantly interacting fermi gas",
    ", one can show that @xmath117 is related to the @xmath122 at the center of the trap by @xmath123 while the @xmath64 is related to @xmath37 by @xmath124^{1/3}}.\\ ] ] figure  [ fig : ee0vsttf ] shows the conversion between @xmath117 and @xmath37 for a resonantly interacting fermi gas in comparison with the ideal non - interacting fermi gases .",

    "@xcite gives the value @xmath127 .",
    "for the ideal fermi gas at @xmath14 , @xmath128 by definition .",
    "we finally note that we applied both methods to various data sets to check whether they produce consistent results .",
    "in general we find satisfying agreement with each other , as the example of the data set in fig .",
