    "the obtaining of equations , which can accurately describe electrokinetic phenomena in concentrated dispersions , is impeded by a series of causes .",
    "the influence of the interaction between equilibrium and polarization fields of colloid particles becomes considerable .",
    "the properties of disperse medium are also changed by the surface of solid phase .",
    "liquid layers being near the surface and having peculiar properties occupy a substantial volume part of a concentrated dispersion threshold space and strongly influence the electrokinetic phenomena .systematic investigations of the electrokinetic phenomena in the systems of colloidal dispersity led to the discovery of regularities [ 1- 3 ] which initiated the elaboration of the electroosmosis theory in plane capillaries for the limiting case of large degree of electric double layers overlapping [ 4 ] . unlike the previous work [ 5 ]",
    ", the model of the near wall layer of fluid in which it combined the non - dissolving volume properties with the hydrodynamic mobility was developed and this gave a theoretical explanation for many experimental results .",
    "the continuation of investigations in this field was the construction of the cell theory of the electroosmosis [ 6 ] where the cell model widely applied while solving hydrodynamic tasks [ 7 ] was used to electrokinetic problems .",
    "the present paper contains theoretical calculations of the conductivity and electroosmotic transfer as functions of disperse phase volume fraction for experimentally investigated systems and the comparison of obtained calculations with the experimental data .",
    "in the cell model a single particle ( radius @xmath0 ) is considered to be surrounded by a sphere of such a size ( radius @xmath1 ) that the fraction of liquid within the sphere is the same as the porosity of the colloid system .",
    "suspension is considered as the aggregate of these typical structural units .",
    "having designated the volume particle fraction in the suspension by @xmath2 , we obtain : @xmath3 having designated the radius of the dissolving and non - dissolving layer in the cell by @xmath4 , the thickness of the non - dissolving boundary layer @xmath5 is : @xmath6 ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) . in the work [ 6 ] for the calculation of the electroosmosis rate of the 1 - 1 binary electrolyte",
    "the following equation system was solved : @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the fluid viscosity , @xmath11 is the pressure , @xmath12 is the fluid rate , @xmath13 are dimensionless ( in the @xmath14 units ) electrochemical ion potentials , @xmath15 are their concentrations . in this case @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the concentration of the equilibrium solution of the electrolyte .",
    "the general solutions were given by the equations : @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21    a substitution of these general equations in the edge conditions of system ( 3 - 5 ) ( taking into account other conditions characterizing the electroosmosis process ) enables to obtain values of the fluid rate @xmath22 , electrochemical ion potentials @xmath23 , the average electric field @xmath24 , the electroosmotic transfer @xmath25 and the conductivity @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the electric current , @xmath28 is the faraday constant ):",
    "@xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 ( 13 ) the edge problem is reduced to 12 linear algebraic equations by a substitution of the general solutions ( 6 - 9 ) into the edge conditions of the system ( 3 - 5 ) ( taking into account other conditions characterizing the electroosmosis process ) . in the present paper",
    "the determination of values of the liquid velocity @xmath12 and electrochemical potentials @xmath23 was provided by solving this system of equations .",
    "the gauss numerical method , which is classified as direct , was used for the solution , taking into consideration relatively low order of the determinant [ 8 ] .",
    "the brief algorithm of the system solution is described below :    1.input n - the order of the equations system    2.formation of the augmented matrix a ( n , n+1 )    3.gauss method    4.output of the solution x ( n )    parameters for the problem solution were taken from the work [ 9 ] in which dispersion of synthetic diamond in hcl solution was investigated .",
    "calculations of @xmath25 and @xmath26 were provided for the suspension with particle radius @xmath33 m , surface charge density @xmath34 c/@xmath35 , electrolyte concentration @xmath36 mole / l hcl .",
    "the calculation results of the electroosmotic transfer @xmath25 and the conductivity @xmath26 as functions of the volume particle fraction @xmath2 are given on fig.[fig2]-[fig3 ] .",
    "@xmath25 was calculated for different non - dissolving boundary layer thicknesses @xmath37 nm and @xmath38 nm . the experimental dependencies of @xmath25 and @xmath26 for the same values of particle radius @xmath0 , electrolyte concentration @xmath39 , surface charge density @xmath40 and volume particle fraction @xmath2 are given on these figures too .",
    "the dependence of the electroosmotic transfer @xmath25 on the volume particle fraction @xmath2 which was determined on the basis of the cell theory of the electroosmosis shows the correspondence to the experimental regularity .",
    "the increase of charged particle concentration in the suspension results in the increase of the degree of particle diffuse double layers overlapping and the augment of counterion concentration in the porous space .",
    "thus , the electroosmotic transfer diminishes with the volume particle fraction increase .",
    "theoretically obtained function @xmath41 ( fig.[fig2 ] , line 1 for @xmath37 nm , line 2 for @xmath38 nm ) is linear which is typical for the electroosmosis in concentrated disperse systems .",
    "the increase of the non- dissolving boundary layer thickness leads to the decrease ( in these conditions ) of @xmath25 which is confirmed by the experiment ( fig.[fig2 ] , lines 3 , 4 ) .",
    "the calculations of diamond particles dispersion conductivity @xmath26 versus the volume particle fraction @xmath2 are shown on fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "line 1 corresponds to experimental data , line 2 does to theoretical ones . in this case , when the electrolyte concentration is low and values of volume particle fraction are high , the effect of specific surface conductivity is significant .",
    "the resistance increase due to the increase of the insulating particle concentration is compensated and the conductivity of suspension is growing with the volume particle fraction augment ( so called capillary superconductivity [ 10 ] ) .",
    "the calculation results ( accordingly the cell theory of the electroosmosis ) show the correspondence to and describe the main features of the experimental data : linear dependence of @xmath41 , the electroosmotic transfer increase with the decrease of the non - dissolving boundary layer thickness , character of dependencies @xmath26 on @xmath2 .",
    "the quantitative description of real disperse systems is impeded by a series of cases such as presence of particles of different sizes , deviation of particle shape from spherical , influence of specific surface conductivity .",
    "more detailed investigations of concentrated suspensions properties using the model systems which have more definite physical and chemical parameters are the subjects of future work .",
