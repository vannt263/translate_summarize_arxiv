    "the current picture of bulge demography reveals that disk galaxies can host bulges with different photometric and kinematic properties ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "classical bulges are similar to low - luminosity ellipticals and are thought to be formed by mergers and rapid collapse .",
    "pseudobulges are disk - like or bar - like components which were slowly assembled by acquired material , efficiently transferred to galaxy center where it formed stars .",
    "pseudobulges can be identified according to their morphologic , photometric , and kinematic properties because they retain a memory of their disky origin .",
    "pseudobulges are expected to be more rotation - dominated than classical bulges which are more rotation - dominated than giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "a list of pseudobulges characteristics was compiled by @xcite .",
    "the more apply , the safer the classification becomes .",
    "we derived the structural parameters , stellar kinematics , and line - strength indices for a sample of 14 disk galaxies in groups and clusters @xcite .",
    "the bulge of the sb spiral ngc  1292 has a srsic index @xmath0 and an apparent flattening which is similar to that of the galaxy disk ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the measured @xmath2 is consistent with being significantly larger than that derived for an oblate spheroid ( fig .",

    "it is characterized by a lower velocity dispersion ( or equivalently a higher luminosity ) with respect to its early - type counterparts ( fig .",

    "ngc  1292 is also a low-@xmath5 ( or a high-@xmath6 ) outlier with respect to the relationship found for faint early - type galaxies by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath7 ) .",
    "information about the stellar population give more constraints on its nature and formation process .",
    "the bulge population has a intermediate age ( 3 gyr ) and low metal content ( @xmath8 dex ) .",
    "the @xmath9fe enhancement is the lowest in our sample ( @xmath10 dex ) suggesting a prolonged star formation history .",
    "the presence of emission lines in the spectrum shows that star formation is still ongoing .",
    "according to the prescriptions by @xcite , the bulge of ngc  1292 is a good candidate to be pseudobulge .",
