    ", electrostatics plays a key role in proteins structure @xcite , interaction of dna and proteins with charged ligands @xcite , dna packaging and condensation @xcite , conformation of polyelectrolytes in solution and their aggregation behavior @xcite and interaction between charged colloids and their collective behavior in solution @xcite .",
    "numerous experimental and theoretical studies have been performed to understand these phenomena and to elucidate the role of electrostatic interactions .",
    "the study of the counterions distribution and electric potential around dna @xcite , the interaction between two dnas @xcite and the same studies on similarly or oppositely charged surfaces @xcite are examples of these studies .",
    "the difference between dielectric constant of water ( @xmath0 ) and that of organic materials ( @xmath1 ) , silica ( @xmath2 ) and air ( @xmath3 ) is an important factor in electrostatic interactions of related systems .",
    "the role of such dielectric inhomogeneity has been investigated in systems like ionic channels @xcite , ions or colloids at the air - water interface @xcite , copolymers in electric field @xcite and polyelectrolytes adsorbed to an interface @xcite .",
    "more efforts are needed to investigate the effects arisen from dielectric inhomogeneity on distribution of the counterions around charged objects and the interactions between them @xcite .    when the electrostatic interactions in a system are much stronger than the thermal energy , mean field theories such as poisson - boltzmann formalism are not suitable for describing the behavior of the system .",
    "in this situation , known as the strong coupling ( sc ) limit @xcite , another theory , which is derived from the virial expansion of the system partition function , can be used .",
    "this theory has been used to study electrostatic interactions between charged objects and counterion distribution around them .",
    "such studies have been performed for two parallel charged plates considering their surface charge density as uniform @xcite and discrete @xcite .",
    "also , electrostatic interaction between two overally neutral plates of randomly distributed annealed or quenched charges of both signs has been studied @xcite .",
    "corrections to the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite are suggested to describe the system behavior in a broader range of the parameters , namely the intermediate coupling regime @xcite .",
    "such corrections are recently formalized by expansion of the partition function around the ground state of the system in which the wigner crystal is formed by the counterions @xcite .",
    "this approach gives a correction to the prefactor of the second term of the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite to agree with monte carlo simulations .",
    "the system of two uniformly charged dielectric slabs has been studied taking into consideration the effects arising from dielectric inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that in the sc limit the dielectric inhomogeneities cause accumulation of the counterions in the middle of the intersurface space between the slabs .",
    "also , it has been shown in these studies that the dielectric inhomogeneities increase the repulsive pressure between the slabs at small inter - slab separations .",
    "a widely used simplification in the studies of charged systems is the consideration of the charge distribution on the surfaces of charged objects as uniform . clearly , this approximation is feasible only when the ions in the solution are far from the charged surfaces and also the separation between charged surfaces are quite larger than the typical separation between charged residues on the surfaces .",
    "when a point charge is very close to a big charged object or when two charged objects are very close to each other , discreteness of charge should be taken into account in calculation of the electrostatic interactions . in the sc limit",
    ", it has been shown that the distribution of counterions in the vicinity of a discretely charged plate is very different from that of a uniformly charged plate . in the former case ,",
    "counterions have a strong lateral correlation with the surface charges and counterion density on the surface is much higher relative to the case of uniformly charged surface @xcite . for the case of two",
    "discretely charged surfaces of the same sign , most of the counterions crowd near the surfaces and the attraction between the surfaces is stronger compared to the case of uniformly charged surfaces @xcite .",
    "the same differences have also been observed in the weak coupling limit @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to consider the effects of both dielectric inhomogeneity and discreteness of charge on the electrostatic interaction between two similarly charged parallel dielectric slabs .",
    "we consider the charge distribution on the surface of each slab as square shaped uniformly charged regions of side length @xmath4 whose centers are on a square lattice of spacing @xmath5 , as is shown in fig .",
    "the case of @xmath6 corresponds to uniform charge distribution on the slabs and @xmath7 corresponds to distribution of point charges .",
    "we use the green function method to calculate interaction energies of each counterion with its images and the surface charges , and use it to obtain the counterion density profile in the sc limit . despite previous works ( e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) , all the fourier modes of the charge distribution are taken into consideration here .",
    "this allows us to study the extreme limit of point charges on the surfaces , where the system behavior is noticeably different ( see below ) .",
    "interaction between the slabs is calculated by two approaches : the first approach is valid for low temperatures and the point - charge distribution on the slabs in which interactions of the counterions with each other is taken into account .",
    "the other approach is valid for room temperature and arbitrary values of @xmath4 , which is accurate in the sc limit where the effect of counterions interactions on the pressure between the slabs can be ignored .",
    "we find that consideration of the dielectric inhomogeneity in electrostatic interactions of the system increases the tendency of the counterions to gather in the middle of the intersurface space between the two slabs .",
    "taking into account the discreteness of charge on the slabs however , increases the counterion density in the vicinity of the slabs surfaces . resulted from these two competing effects , when the slabs are in far or close separations the counterions are mostly distributed in the vicinity of the surfaces or in the middle of intersurface space between them , respectively . in the limit of point - charge distribution of the surfaces , independent of the dielectric inhomogeneity strength , density of the counterions",
    "is maximum in the vicinity of the slabs surfaces at all inter - slab separations .",
    "it is found that the interaction between the slabs , at low temperatures is always attractive and its strength increases with increasing the difference between dielectric constants of the slabs and that of the environment . at room temperature , depending on the strength of charge discreteness and dielectric inhomogeneity , the system is found to have two different behaviors : the slabs stand in an equilibrium distance from each other or completely attract each other after passing a repulsive barrier in the intermediate separations .",
    "it is also found that for a range of the system parameters there are two equilibrium separations between the slabs corresponding to two minima in the free energy of the system . in the absence of dielectric inhomogeneity , by changing the charge distribution on the surfaces from uniform to point charges , the entropic repulsion barrier between the surfaces disappears and they attract each other at all values of inter - slab separation . these results are not observed in previous works and show the importance of considering the discreteness of charge .",
    "the effects of the dielectric inhomogeneity and the charge discreteness on the pressure between the slabs are also studied .",
    "we consider a system of two infinite dielectric slabs of thicknesses @xmath8 and @xmath9 with dielectric constant @xmath10 .",

    ", @xmath7 corresponds to the distribution of point charges on a square lattice of spacing @xmath5 on the slabs surfaces , whereas @xmath6 corresponds to the uniformly charged surfaces of the slabs .",
    "the case of @xmath21 describes the distribution of uniformly charged domains on the slabs surfaces .",
    "it is worth mentioning that to avoid any undesired singularities , a cut - off layer of thickness @xmath22 is supposed on each slab where the counterions can not penetrate .",
    "we consider the system in the sc limit .",

    ", the interaction between the slabs was shown that is attractive at small inter - slab separations . in this case , the dielectric inhomogeneity may increase or decrease the attractive pressure , depending on the value of the parameters .",
    "another point to note is the large depth of the energy wells in figs .",
    "[ fig:1slab - energy ] and [ fig:1slab - e - x ] relative to the thermal energy , @xmath82 .",
    "it shows that the charge discreteness and the dielectric inhomogeneity strongly affect the equilibrium distribution of the counterions and hence the interaction between the slabs .",
    "regarding the competing effects of charge discreteness and the dielectric inhomogeneity , our results showed that considering only one of these realities and leaving out the other one may crucially bias the results of the theory .    in this paper , distribution of the counterions and interaction between the slabs",
    "are obtained from the sc theory at the leading order of the expansion .",
    "it has been shown that this approximation is correct for discretely charged surfaces in coupling parameters larger than 20 @xcite .",
    "many biological systems lie in this range .",
    "however , when the separation between the two charged plates gets very large , the first order term becomes smaller than the second term and this approximation fails .",
    "this critical distance is found for uniformly charged plates with and without dielectric inhomogeneity .",
    "computer simulations have also been used to find the validity range of the sc theory in these systems @xcite . as a result",
    ", computer simulations considering both the dielectric inhomogeneity and the charge discreteness effects seem essential .",
    "the sc theory is obtained from an expansion of the system parameters in inverse powers of the coupling parameter @xmath124 .",
    "theoretically , sc formalism is exact in the limit of @xmath125 , however computer simulations have shown that the results become accurate for values of @xmath126 @xcite . in biological conditions",
    ", @xmath127 is equivalent to @xmath128 in our model or surface charge density @xmath129 which is of the order of the typical charge density of charged biological membranes and dna @xcite . for discretely charged surfaces ,",
    "sc theory has been shown to be exact even in lower values of @xmath124 ( down to @xmath130 ) due to the weakened correlations between the counterions @xcite .",
    "also , it has been shown that the presence of the dielectric inhomogeneity widens the validity range of the sc theory @xcite .",
    "the validity range of the sc theory in the case of a single charged plate is @xmath131 in which @xmath14 is the separation between counterions and the surface and @xmath132 is the mutual separation between the counterions parallel to the surface .",
    "this range for the system of two parallel charged surfaces is @xmath133 in which @xmath90 is the separation between the surfaces @xcite . in our model",
    ", the lattice spacing of the regular charge distribution on the surfaces , @xmath5 , plays the role of @xmath132 of the sc theory . considering that the most of our results have been obtained using parameters in the range of @xmath134 , the validity of the sc theory is preserved .",
    "one should note that a sharp boundary is assumed between inside and outside of the slabs in our model . in reality",
    ", it is known that such a sharp boundary is not the case and an improvement of our model could be the consideration of a smooth profile of the dielectric constant in the slabs boundaries .",
    "some additional points in the way of approving the theory are as follows .",
    "the grand canonical ensemble is more proper for study of the real systems such as the system of dielectric slabs with counterions studied here but the sc theory is developed in the canonical ensemble .",
    "developing a theory in which the number of the counterions between the slabs is not constant seems as a valuable step .",
    "the finite distance of the fixed charges from the slab surface @xcite , random distribution of the charged domains @xcite , displacement of the charged domains by changing the system parameters in some cases @xcite and possibility of their hydration @xcite should be considered in development of the theory .",
    "also , experimental studies on the effects of different factors on the distribution of the counterions and interaction between charged dielectrics can also be insightful .",
    "for example , the effect of the dielectric inhomogeneity on the interaction of two charged dielectrics seems to be possible by changing the solvent @xcite and is not studied yet to the authors knowledge .",
    "we are grateful to f. julicher , s. n. rasuli , and m. f. miri for interesting discussions and comments .",
