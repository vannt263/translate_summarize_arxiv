    "the quantum effects of the 2 dimensional ( 2d ) gravitational theories are recently measured numerically in the computer simulation with high statistics . in particular the data for the entropy exponent ( string susceptibility ) in 2d quantum gravity(qg ) is the same as the known exact result within a relative precision of @xmath3 .",

    "3 .   this approach can be used for the higher - dimensional qg such as 3d and 4d qg .    the approach is perturbative , therefore choosing the most appropriate vacuum under the global constraints ( such as the area constraint and the topology constraint ) is crucial in the proper evaluation . we explain it in sect.3 .",
