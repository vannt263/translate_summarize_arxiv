    "feynman propagators are distributions , and stueckelberg realized very early that renormalization was essentially the problem of defining a product of distributions  @xcite .",
    "this point of view was clarified by bogoliubov , shirkov , epstein and glaser  @xcite but was almost forgotten .    in a ground - breaking paper  @xcite , radzikowski showed that the _ wavefront set _ of a distribution was a crucial concept to define quantum fields in curved spacetime .",
    "this idea was fully developed into a renormalized scalar field theory in curved spacetimes by brunetti , fredenhagen  @xcite , hollands and wald  @xcite .",
    "this approach was rapidly extended to the case of dirac fields  @xcite , to gauge fields  @xcite and even to the quantization of gravitation  @xcite .",
    "this tremendous progress was made possible by a complete reformulation of quantum field theory , where the wavefront set of distributions plays a central role , for example to determine the algebra of microcausal functions and to define a spectral condition for time - ordered products and quantum states  @xcite .",
    "the wavefront set was also a decisive tool to discuss the existence of time - machine spacetimes  @xcite , quantum energy inequalities  @xcite and cosmological models  @xcite .    until the early 90s ,",
    "the wavefront set was rarely used to solve physical problems .",
    "we only know of a few works in crystal optics  @xcite and quantum field theory on curved spacetimes  @xcite .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that this concept is not familiar to most physicists and not easy to grasp .",
    "but now , the wavefront set is here to stay and we think that a smooth and physically motivated introduction to it is worthwhile . this is the purpose of the present paper .",
    "there are textbook descriptions of the wavefront set  @xcite , but they do not give any clue on its physical meaning and advanced textbooks are notoriously laconic ( the outstanding exception being the book by gregory eskin  @xcite ) .    the main use of the wavefront set in quantum field theory is to provide a condition for the product of distributions .",
    "indeed , the feynman propagator is a distribution and the products of propagators present in a feynman diagrams are not well defined .",
    "the wavefront set gives a precise description of the region of spacetime where the product is well defined and the value of the feynman diagram on the whole spacetime is then obtained by an extension procedure  @xcite .",
    "after this introduction , we discuss in simple terms the problem of the multiplication of one - dimensional distributions .",
    "this elementary example reveals a natural condition for two distributions to be multiplied and this condition leads to the definition of the wavefront set . after giving elementary examples of wavefront sets , we discuss in detail the wavefront set of the characteristic function of a domain @xmath0 in the plane ( i.e. a function which is equal to 1 on @xmath0 to 0 outside it ) . to bring a physical feel of the concept , we give two new characterizations of the wavefront set : the first one uses a radon transform , the second",
    "one counts the number of intersections of straight lines with the boundary of @xmath0 .",
    "these two characterizations do not employ any fourier transform .",
    "the next section explores the wavefront set of a distribution defined by an oscillatory integral .",
    "this technique is crucial to calculate the wavefront set of the wightman and feynman propagators in quantum field theory .",
    "the main properties of the wavefront set are listed without proof .",
    "the last section enumerates other definitions of the wavefront set .",
    "we shall introduce the wavefront set as a condition required to multiply distributions .",
    "we first recall that a distribution @xmath1 is a continuous linear map from the set of smooth compactly supported functions @xmath2 to the complex numbers , and we denote @xmath3 by @xmath4 .",
    "for example , if @xmath5 is the dirac delta distribution , then @xmath6 . if @xmath7 is a locally integrable function , then we can consider it as a distribution by associating to @xmath7 the distribution @xmath8 ( for a nice introduction to distributions see for example @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that distributions can generally not be multiplied  @xcite .",
    "the first reason is the very definition of distributions as objects which generalize the functions but for which the ` value at some point ' has no sense in general .",
    "but , motivated by questions in theoretical physics ( e.g. quantum field theory ) , we may ask under which circumstances it is possible to _ extend _ the product of ordinary functions to distributions . in most cases",
    "this is just impossible .",
    "for instance we can not make sense of the square of @xmath5 : a simple way to convince yourself of that is to study the family of functions @xmath9 for @xmath10 defined by @xmath11 if @xmath12 and @xmath13 otherwise . for any @xmath14 we have @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "however , the square of @xmath17 does not converge to a distribution : @xmath18 diverges for @xmath19 .    in some other cases it is possible to define a product , but we loose some good properties .",
    "consider the example of the heaviside step function @xmath20 , which is defined by @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "its associated distribution , denoted by @xmath25 , is @xmath26 the _ function _",
    "@xmath20 can obviously be multiplied with itself and @xmath27 for any integer @xmath28 . as we shall see",
    ", it is possible to define a product of distributions such that @xmath29 as a distribution .",
    "but then , we loose the compatibility of the product with the leibniz rule because , by taking the derivative of both sides we would obtain @xmath30 .",
    "the identity @xmath31 and @xmath32 would give us @xmath33 for all integers @xmath34 .",
    "since the left hand side depends linearly on @xmath35 and the right hand side does not and is not equal to zero , we reach a contradiction .",
    "the leibniz rule is essential for applications in mathematical physics and we shall define a product of distributions obeying the leibniz rule .",
    "we first enumerate some conditions under which distributions can be safely multiplied .",
    "the product of distributions is well defined when one of the two distributions is a smooth function .",
    "indeed , consider a distribution @xmath36 and a smooth function @xmath37 .",
    "then , for all test function @xmath38 we can define the product of @xmath39 and @xmath40 by @xmath41 .",
    "we can also define the product of two distributions when the singularities of the distributions are disjoint . to make this more precise",
    ", we recall that the _ support of a function _ @xmath42 , denoted by @xmath43 , is the closure of the set of points where the function is not zero  @xcite . for example",
    ", the support of the heaviside function is @xmath44 .",
    "note that although a function is zero outside its support , it can also vanish at isolated points of its support , because of the closure condition of the definition .",
    "for example the support of the sine function is @xmath45 although @xmath46 .",
    "however , the _ support of a distribution _ can not be defined as the support of a function because the value of a distribution at a point is generally not defined .",
    "hence we define the support by duality : we say that the point @xmath47 does not belong to the support of the distribution @xmath39 if and only if there is an open neighborhood @xmath48 of @xmath47 such that @xmath39 is zero on @xmath48 , in other words if @xmath49 for all test functions @xmath42 whose support is contained in @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "for example @xmath50 and @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "similarly , we can define the singular support of a distribution @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath52 , by saying that @xmath53 if and only if there is a neighborhood @xmath48 of @xmath47 such that the restriction of @xmath39 to @xmath48 is a smooth function , in other words if there is a smooth function @xmath54 such that @xmath55 for all test functions @xmath42 supported on @xmath48  @xcite . for example @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "a more elaborate example is the distribution @xmath58 , defined by : @xmath59 , i.e. @xmath39 is the limit in @xmath60 of @xmath61 , when @xmath62 and @xmath63 , this means that  @xcite : @xmath64 if @xmath65 , consider the open set @xmath66 .",
    "take a smooth function @xmath67 such that @xmath68 for @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "then , for any @xmath42 supported on @xmath48 we have @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "thus , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is smooth because @xmath70 for @xmath76 ( see fig .  [ figchi ] ) .    , the open set is @xmath77 and the smooth function @xmath67 is supported on @xmath78 .",
    "[ figchi],width=264 ]    as a consequence , every @xmath65 is not in the singular spectrum of @xmath39 and @xmath79 because the imaginary part of @xmath39 is proportional to a dirac @xmath5 distribution .",
    "we can now state an important theorem  @xcite .",
    "[ singsupthm ] if @xmath39 and @xmath80 are two distributions in @xmath81 such that @xmath82 , then the product @xmath83 is well defined .",
    "we first notice that , if @xmath84 is supported outside the singular support of @xmath80 , then @xmath85 is smooth and we can define the product by @xmath86 .",
    "similary , @xmath87 if @xmath42 is supported outside the singular support of @xmath39 .",
    "this definition of @xmath83 extends to all test functions @xmath42 by using a smooth function @xmath67 which is equal to zero on a neighborhood of the singular support of @xmath39 and equal to one on a neighborhood of the singular support of @xmath80 .",
    "then @xmath88 .",
    "this product is associative and commutative  @xcite .",
    "consider the two distributions @xmath89 and @xmath90 in @xmath91 , i.e. , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "then we can define their product by @xmath95 , i.e. @xmath96 , since @xmath97 by the fubini theorem for distributions . here",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath80 are singular on the lines @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively , which have a non empty intersection @xmath100 .",
    "however the oscillations of both distributions are orthogonal at that point , so that this definition makes sense .",
    "but actually the orthogonality is not essential and , as we will see , the important point is the transversality .",
    "indeed we can extend this example to measures which are supported by non orthogonal lines : let @xmath101 be a _ linear invertible _ map and set @xmath102 and @xmath103 and @xmath104 , where @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 .",
    "these distributions are well - defined and they are singular on the line of equation @xmath108 and @xmath109 respectively .",
    "moreover we can define @xmath110 by setting @xmath111 .",
    "hence here @xmath112 and we see that the product makes sense as long as @xmath113 , which means that the singular supports of @xmath114 and @xmath115 are _",
    "transversal_.      this last case looks as the most mysterious at first glance and concerns complex valued distributions .",
    "consider the distribution @xmath116 defined previously , i.e. the limit of @xmath117 when @xmath10 and @xmath63 .",
    "( hence @xmath118 . )",
    "observe that @xmath119 , @xmath120 .",
    "thus since @xmath121 converges to @xmath122 in @xmath60 , we can set @xmath123 .",
    "moreover since any polynomial relation in @xmath124 and its derivatives which follows from leibniz rule is satisfied ( @xmath124 being a smooth function ) , the same holds for @xmath39 .",
    "one can define similarly the square of @xmath125 .",
    "however this recipe fails for defining the product of @xmath39 by @xmath126 .",
    "a similar mechanism works for making sense of the square of the _ wightman function _ ( see section [ oscillatory ] ) . one way to understand what s happening is to remark that we multiply distributions which are boundary values of holomorphic functions on the same domain .    in order to really understand all these examples and go beyond",
    ", we need to revisit them by using refined tools such as : the radon transform and the fourier transform .",
    "this will lead us to hrmander s definition of wavefront sets .",
    "we remark that the fourier transform of a product of distributions ( when it is defined ) is the convolution of the fourier transforms of these distributions  @xcite : @xmath127 , if it exists .",
    "therefore , we can define the product of two distributions @xmath39 and @xmath80 as the inverse fourier transform of @xmath128 . however , this definition , which requires the fourier transforms of @xmath39 and @xmath80 to be defined and their convolution product to make sense , can be improved .",
    "indeed it does not take into account the fact that the product of two distributions is _ local _",
    ", i.e. that its definition on the neighbhorhood of a point depends only on the restriction of the distributions on that neighborhood .",
    "therefore , we can localize the distributions by multiplying them with a test function : if @xmath129 and @xmath130 , then @xmath131 is a distribution with compact support in @xmath48 and we can extend it to a distribution defined on @xmath132 by setting it to equal to zero outside @xmath48 .",
    "let us still denote by @xmath131 this compactly supported distribution on @xmath132 .",
    "it has a fourier transform @xmath133 which is an entire analytic function of @xmath134 by the paley ",
    "wiener  schwartz theorem .",
    "following the physicist s convention  @xcite,@xcite , we define the fourier transform of @xmath39 by @xmath135 where @xmath136 ( we could interpret this quantity as an euclidean scalar product between two vectors in @xmath132 ; however as we will see in section [ oscillatory ] it is better to understand @xmath134 as a _",
    "covector _ and the product @xmath137 as a _ duality _ product , this is the reason for the lower indices used for the coordinates of @xmath134 and the upper indices used for the coordinates of @xmath47 ) .",
    "more rigorously , the above definition applies to functions @xmath42 of rapid decrease and , for a tempered distribution @xmath39 , the fourier transform is defined by @xmath138 .",
    "the inverse fourier transform is @xmath139 where @xmath35 is the dimension of spacetime .",
    "the same convention was used , for example , by franco and acebal  @xcite . note the relation between this fourier transform and the one used in other references : @xmath140  @xcite , or @xmath141  @xcite .",
    "we can now give a definition of the product of two distributions .",
    "note that there are alternative definitions , under different hypotheses ( and we will meet another one later on ) . for a general overwiew about the existing options , see @xcite .",
    "[ definition - product-1 ] let @xmath39 and @xmath80 in @xmath81 .",

    "we showed that @xmath210 exists and the same reasoning implies that @xmath211 exists .",

    "thus , @xmath205 exists although the fourier transform of @xmath39 ( i.e. @xmath215 ) is slowly decreasing in both directions .",
    "therefore , the role of the localizing test function @xmath42 is not only to make the fourier transform of @xmath131 exist ( even when the fourier transform of @xmath39 does not ) , but also to isolate the singularities of @xmath39 . in example",
    "[ exupv ] , the two singular points of @xmath39 are @xmath216 and @xmath217 . to localize the distribution around @xmath216 , we multiply @xmath39 by a smooth function @xmath42 such that @xmath203 and @xmath218 for @xmath219 , so that @xmath220 is fast decreasing in the direction of @xmath221 because the contribution of @xmath222 is eliminated .",

    "+      in the previous examples , we saw that the calculation of the product of two distributions by using the fourier transform looks rather tricky .",
    "in particular , it seems that we have to know the fourier transform of the product of each distribution with an arbitrary function .",
    "moreover even when we are able to define it , the product of distribution does not always satisfy the leibniz rule @xmath228 .",
    "for instance the product of @xmath25 makes sense ( example  [ exampleheaviside ] ) but does not respect the leibniz rule ( see section [ multdissect ] ) . on the other hand the square of @xmath229 can be defined ( see example [ example1surx ] ) and this definition agrees with leibniz rule .    fortunately , hrmander devised a powerful condition on a pair of distributions to : 1 ) guarantee the existence of their product without computing it ; 2 ) ensure that this product satisfies the leibniz rule .",
    "as a preparation for this condition , we can analyze why the product exists in example  [ exuu ] and not in example  [ exuv ] .",
    "in example  [ exuu ] , the support of @xmath230 is @xmath231 and , because of the convolution formula @xmath232 , the support of @xmath232 as a function of @xmath233 is the finite interval @xmath234}$ ] if @xmath235 and is empty if @xmath221 .",

    "the support of @xmath236 is @xmath237 , which is infinite .    in general , for the convolution integral to be well defined",
    ", we just need that the product @xmath238 decreases fast enough for large @xmath233 for the integral over @xmath233 to be absolutely convergent .",
    "note also that , for any distribution @xmath39 and for any smooth function @xmath42 with compact support , since @xmath131 is a distribution with compact support , its fourier transform @xmath239 grows at most polynomially at infinity , i.e. there exists some @xmath240 and some constant @xmath241 such that @xmath242 everywhere .",
    "hence it is enough that one of the two factors in the product @xmath238 is fast decreasing at infinity to ensure that the product is fast decreasing . in example",
    "[ exuu ] , @xmath243 decreases very fast for @xmath244 but does not decrease for @xmath245 . if @xmath243 decreases slowly in some directions @xmath233 , this must be compensated by a fast decrease of @xmath246 in the same direction @xmath233 .",
    "this is exactly what happens in example  [ exuu ] and not in example  [ exuv ] .",
    "lastly example [ exampleu1u2 ] confirms that a general condition for the existence of a product of distributions should use the fourier transform of distributions localized around singular points .",
    "it is now time to introduce the key notion for defining hrmander s product of distributions : the _ wavefront set_.",
    "we want to find a sufficient condition by which the product of distributions defined in eq .  ( [ disprod ] ) is absolutely convergent . in this",

    "however , since we also wish the product of distributions to be compatible with derivatives through the leibniz rule @xmath252 and since a derivative of order @xmath35 increases the order of @xmath39 by @xmath35 , what we really need is that @xmath253 decreases faster than any inverse power of @xmath254 .",

    "we start by defining some basic tools : the conical neighborhoods and the fast decreasing functions .",

    "this theorem is physically reasonable because , if @xmath42 is a smooth function , then @xmath270 oscillates widely when @xmath134 is large , so that the average of this expression ( i.e. @xmath271 ) is very small .",
