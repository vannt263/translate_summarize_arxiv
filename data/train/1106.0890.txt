    "the standard model coupled to gravity has a unique four - dimensional vacuum .",
    "nevertheless , in case of one spatial dimension compactified on a circle @xcite , or for two spatial dimensions compactified on a 2-torus , it has recently been shown that there may also exist lower - dimensional vacua stabilized by the casimir energies of the standard model particles with the lowest mass , i.e. , gravitons , photons and neutrinos .",
    "such vacua of the low - energy effective theory exist at zero temperature for a wide range of experimentally allowed neutrino masses . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that at high enough temperatures these stationary points are washed out . at zero temperature",
    "an extremely small rate for tunneling to a lower - dimensional anti - de sitter spacetime was found following the steps outlined in @xcite .",
    "this work completes the series of papers @xcite concerning lower - dimensional standard model vacua by considering the last remaining case , when all spatial dimensions are compactified .",
    "we analyze the compactifications on @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , but our primary focus is on the 3-torus case , since it seems the most natural three - dimensional topology with no curvature .",
    "three - dimensional compactifications are qualitatively different from the one- and two - dimensional compactifications , since a stable vacuum can not occur for a `` generic range '' of neutrino masses .",
    "nonetheless , a brief study of this case is worthwhile .",
    "the geometry of the lower - dimensional vacuum is determined by the shape of the effective potential , which is a sum of casimir energies of the particles and the cosmological constant term .",
    "we show that this potential for the 3-torus case has no stable stationary points at zero temperature . for the standard model with dirac neutrinos , however , there does exist an unstable stationary point for a particular set of neutrino masses , depending on the type of hierarchy .",
    "in this section we explore the existence of lower - dimensional vacua of the standard model coupled to gravity with spatial dimensions compactified on a 3-torus .",
    "we start with the 4d einstein - hilbert action , @xmath5,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the determinant of the 4d metric , the planck mass @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the ricci scalar , and @xmath9 is the standard model lagrangian including the cosmological constant . consider the following spacetime interval , ds^2 = - n^2 d t^2 + t_i j d y^i d y^j , where @xmath10 is the metric on the 3-torus with @xmath11 and the compact coordinates @xmath12 .",
    "we adopt the same parametrization as in @xcite , [ torus ] t_i j = (    ccc 1 & _ 1 & _ 1 + _ 1 & _ 1 ^ 2+_2 ^ 2 & _ 1_1 + _ 2_2 + _ 1 & _ 1_1 + _ 2_2 & _ 1 ^ 2+_2 ^ 2+_3 ^ 2 +    ) , where @xmath13 are the shape moduli and @xmath14 is the volume modulus , all functions only of time .",
    "the dimensionally reduced action is , @xmath15\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the dot indicates a derivative with respect to time .",
    "the potential is given by , [ potentialsum ] v(b , ) = ( 2b)^3 + _ particlesn_fe_0(b , , m )  , where @xmath16 is the cosmological constant , @xmath17 is the casimir energy for a scalar of mass @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the number of degrees of freedom , with a positive sign for bosons and a negative sign for fermions ( i.e. , @xmath20 for the photon and graviton , @xmath21 for a dirac neutrino , @xmath22 for a majorana neutrino @xcite ) . in formula ( [ 1daction ] )",
    "the matrix @xmath23 has the following nonzero entries , & & m_11 =  ,  m_22 =  ,  m_55 =  , + & & m_25 = m_52 = -  ,  m_33 = m_44 =  , + & & m_13 = m_31 = m_24 = m_42 =  .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath23 is positive definite .",
    "varying the action ( [ 1daction ] ) with respect to @xmath24 and setting @xmath25 ( which corresponds to fixing the gauge ) we arrive at , [ eqnow2 ] m_p^2(2)^3(-6b^2 + b^3^t ) + v(b , ) = 0  , thus the total energy has to vanish . as a consequence",
    ", the existence of a vacuum at @xmath26 requires @xmath27 . in addition",
    ", we can set @xmath25 directly in the action ( [ 1daction ] ) and write down the equations of motion that arise from varying the action with respect to the other parameters .",
    "for the volume modulus it takes the form , [ eqnow ] + + ^t -=0  . as noted in @xcite , since all shape moduli have positive definite kinetic energy , while for the volume modulus it is negative , the conditions for the existence of a stable vacuum are , @xmath28 at the stationary point , where @xmath29 .",
    "this presents a fine tuning problem since both the potential and its derivative have to vanish at the same point .",
    "in addition , as we will shortly show , even conditions ( [ conditions ] ) themselves can not be fulfilled simultaneously .",
    "note that the potential @xmath30 is expressed in terms of bare quantities , each of which is divergent .",
    "we first write the cosmological constant as , @xmath31 where @xmath32 @xcite is the observed value , and @xmath33 is the divergent quantum correction , equal to the sum of casimir energies of particles in flat space , @xmath34 the casimir energy for a scalar of mass @xmath18 in a 4d spacetime with spatial dimensions compactified on a 3-torus , assuming periodic boundary conditions , is , [ sum ] e_0(b , , m ) = _ n_1 , n_2 , n_3 = -^(t^i jn_i",
    "n_j+m^2)^ , where @xmath35 is the inverse of @xmath36 given by equation ( [ torus ] ) . the regularized expression for the triple sum in ( [ sum ] ) is derived in the appendix .",
    "we immediately notice that the divergent parts in formula ( [ potentialsum ] ) cancel and we can write the potential as , [ pot ] v(b , ) = ( 2b)^3 ^obs + _ particlesn_fe_0^obs(b , , m )  , where the finite part of the casimir energy ( [ sum ] ) is given by , [ ce ] + & & + _ n_2 , n_3 = -^  _ n_1=1^ + & &  k_1 + & & + m^3/2_11 ^ 1/4_n=1^ k_3/2(n ) + & & + m^2 _",

    "it turns out that even before performing the numerical analysis , we can precisely determine the values of the shape moduli for which the potential ( [ pot ] ) has its extrema .",
    "it can be shown that the casimir energy ( [ sum ] ) is invariant under @xmath45 transformations .",
    "the nine generators of the @xmath45 group are listed in @xcite .",
    "for example , the generator @xmath46 corresponds to a change of indices @xmath47 in ( [ sum ] ) , whereas @xmath48 is equivalent to replacing @xmath49 . the same symmetries are exhibited by the potential ( [ pot ] ) , since it is a linear combination of casimir energies of the particles .",
    "it has been argued that fixed points of the transformation under which the potential is invariant correspond to extrema of this potential @xcite .",
    "such fixed points should also lie on the boundary of the fundamental domain of the symmetry group .",
    "the fundamental region for a 3-torus parametrized as in ( [ torus ] ) is the following @xcite , [ fundamental ] & & 1 _ 1 ^ 2+_2 ^ 2 _ 1 ^ 2+_2 ^ 2+_3 ^ 2  ,   -1/2 < _ 1 , _ 1 1/2  , + & &  _",
    "1_1 + _ 2_2 ( _ 1 ^ 2+_2 ^ 2)/2  ,  _ 2 > 0  .",
    "this is the moduli space of physically distinct 3-tori .",
    "fixed points of @xmath45 correspond to the case when the inequalities in the first and third relation in ( [ fundamental ] ) become equalities , while @xmath50 are @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "a numerical analysis shows that the fixed point corresponding to a minimum of the potential exists for @xmath53 , thus the shape moduli for a vacuum stable in the subspace @xmath54 are , [ shape ] _",
    "0^t = ( , , , , )  .",
    "although neutrino masses have not been determined , we can use experimental mass splittings for the atmospheric and solar neutrinos to generate the spectrum given the lightest neutrino mass and a choice of hierarchy .",
    "this allows us to investigate the potential for various lightest neutrino masses .",
    "experimentally , @xmath55 , @xmath56 @xcite . denoting the lightest neutrino mass by @xmath57 , the masses of the other two neutrinos , assuming normal hierarchy , are @xmath58 and @xmath59 , whereas for an inverted hierarchy the masses are @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    under our assumption @xmath62 , the potential in case of the standard model with dirac neutrinos is , [ 10 ] + & & + .",
    "the plots of @xmath63 for several lightest neutrino masses for normal and inverted hierarchy dirac neutrinos are given in figure 1 ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the only extremum of the potential is a minimum , but the conditions for a stable stationary point ( [ conditions ] ) require it to be a maximum .",
    "this proves that there are no stable one - dimensional vacua of the low - energy effective theory .",
    "nevertheless , we find precisely one set of neutrino masses for each type of hierarchy for which an unstable vacuum exists . in the case of normal hierarchy dirac",
    "neutrinos the lightest neutrino mass for such an unstable vacuum is @xmath64 , whereas in the inverted hierarchy case it is @xmath65 . both unstable vacua appear at the micron scale .    in the case of the standard model with majorana neutrinos the potential takes the form , [ 11 ] + & & + .",
    "figure 2 ( a ) and ( b ) shows the plot of @xmath63 for majorana neutrinos for a few lightest neutrino masses .",
    "note that in this case there does not even exist an unstable vacuum .",
    "our analysis from the last section can be easily extended to other topologies of the compact space , for instance @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "the first two cases are very similar to @xmath0 .",
    "we briefly comment on the other two possibilities , which are considerably different because of a nonzero curvature of the compact space .      denoting the radii of compactification by @xmath66 ,",
    "the metric takes the form , [ three_circles ] ds^2 = - n^2 d t^2 + r_1 ^ 2 ( d y^1)^2 + r_2 ^ 2 ( d y^2)^2 + r_3 ^ 2 ( d y^3)^2 , where @xmath67 .",

    "numerical analysis reveals that the only extremum of the potential is a minimum . the same reasoning as in the 3-torus case leads to a vanishing potential at the stationary point , which is accomplished again only for dirac neutrinos , at @xmath73 , @xmath64 in case of normal hierarchy , and at @xmath74 , @xmath65 for inverted hierarchy .",
    "the conditions fulfilled at the only possible candidate for a stationary point are , therefore , @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "unfortunately , the matrix @xmath71 is not positive definite , which indicates that the existing stationary point is not stable .",
    "thus , the compactification on the manifold @xmath1 does not differ qualitatively from the 3-torus case and there is only one unstable vacuum for dirac neutrinos for each choice of hierarchy .      in this case the metric",
    "is given by , [ three_circles ] ds^2 = - n^2 d t^2 + r^2 ( d y^1)^2 + t_i j d y^i d y^j  , where , t_i j = (    cc 1 & _ 1 + _ 1 & _",

    "as was discussed in @xcite , two - dimensional vacua for the compactification on a 2-torus are characterized by the shape moduli @xmath83 . in the @xmath2 case",
    "we find that those values also correspond to a minimum of the potential .",
    "since in the @xmath84 subspace the matrix @xmath82 is positive definite , the above parameters describe a point stable in the directions @xmath84 . nevertheless , the subspace @xmath85 of matrix @xmath82 is not positive definite .",
    "since the only existing stationary point of @xmath86 is a minimum in both @xmath87 and @xmath88 , it necessarily corresponds to an unstable vacuum , and appears again only for dirac neutrinos at @xmath89 , @xmath64 for normal hierarchy , and @xmath90 , @xmath65 for inverted hierarchy .",
    "for the compactification on a sphere the metric is , [ three_circles ] ds^2 = - n^2 d t^2 + r^2 , where @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",

    "similar arguments as before yield the conditions at the stationary point , [ spherecond ] v = 0  ,  _ r v = 0  .",
    "note that this case is qualitatively different from the previous ones because of a nonzero curvature term .",
    "we find that casimir energies are negligible compared to this curvature term for @xmath94 , which is well satisfied in the region we are considering ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "it is now straightforward to check that both conditions ( [ spherecond ] ) can not be fulfilled simultaneously , which proves that there are no one - dimensional vacua .",
    "this remains true even after introducing a magnetic flux ( see @xcite for how this argument works in case of a two - dimensional compactification on a sphere ) .",
    "choosing the compact topology to be @xmath4 yields exactly the same conclusions .",
    "we have also analyzed 3d compactifications on surfaces of genus greater than one .",
    "for analogous reasons as those presented in @xcite , no vacua exist in those cases .",
    "we have investigated the structure of the standard model coupled to gravity with spatial dimensions compactified on three - dimensional manifolds .",
    "we have focused on the 3-torus compactification , as it seems the most natural three - dimensional topology with no curvature .",
    "other cases can be explored in a similar fashion .    for the 3-torus case ,",
    "we have analyzed the standard model with dirac and majorana neutrinos , both for normal and inverted hierarchy .",
    "we have calculated the effective potential , which contains , apart from the cosmological constant term , the casimir energies of the graviton , photon and neutrinos .",
    "the casimir energies of particles of higher mass are negligible .",
    "we have found , arguing on the basis of the symmetry exhibited by the potential , the unique choice of the toroidal shape parameters required to have a stable vacuum in this subspace .",
    "the potential then becomes a function of just the volume modulus and is precisely determined by the shape moduli , neutrino masses , and their type .",
    "we have shown that there are no stable vacua of the low - energy effective theory , since the volume modulus has a negative kinetic term , while the only extremum of the effective potential is a minimum .",
    "nevertheless , we have found that in case of dirac neutrinos there exists an unstable one - dimensional vacuum for precisely one set of neutrino masses for each type of hierarchy .",
    "the volume modulus for this unstable vacuum is on the order of microns .",
    "this stationary point disappears at high enough temperatures .    for the compactifications on @xmath1 and @xmath2 similar conclusions",
    "were found .",
    "the cases with spatial dimensions compactified on @xmath3 or @xmath4 differ qualitatively because of the presence of a nonzero curvature term .",
