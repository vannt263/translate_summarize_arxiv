    "substantial observational evidence , such as the late - time accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite , supports the idea of an exotic cosmic fluid denoted as _ dark energy _",
    "however , the nature of dark energy is not yet understood and there are two different points of view : first , dark energy is a kind of unknown matter / energy with highly negative pressure and second , that general relativity ( gr ) needs to be modified .",
    "moreover , the requirement of the first approach consists of finding a new type of matter with an equation of state of the form @xmath0 , and its detection will be a milestone for particle physics . nevertheless , according to the second paradigm ,",
    "it is conceivable that gr is a first order approximation to a more fundamental theory .",
    "such an idea is known as modified gravity @xcite .",
    "accordingly , numerous theories of high energy physics , such as string theory and supergravity , predict light , gravitationally coupled scalar fields @xcite . in fact , in all of these theories a scalar field can play the role of dark energy @xcite .",
    "in addition , a fifth force emerges from this scalar field .",
    "in fact , one of the best motivated modifications of gr are scalar - tensor theories @xcite .",
    "these can be interpreted as a generalized form of quintessence models , which contain a scalar field coupled to matter .",
    "it seems natural to assume that the order of this coupling constant is unity and one may interpret it as a source of the fifth force @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to emphasize that the detection of this force not only depends on the value of the coupling constant , but is also associated with the average matter density of the environment .",
    "this idea can be formulated by a `` screening mechanism '' that leads to the suppression of this additional force in a medium with high average matter density such as the solar system @xcite .",
    "recently , two screening mechanisms have been introduced , namely , the chameleon mechanism and the symmetron model .",
    "briefly , they work through different mechanisms , although , they are similar in some respects @xcite . while in the chameleon mechanism @xcite , the effective mass of the field depends on the local matter density , in the symmetron model @xcite , the vacuum - expectation value ( vev ) of the scalar field and the symmetry of the potential are dependent on the local matter density .    in this paper , we focus on the symmetron model and explore alternative potentials to those proposed in the symmetron literature .",
    "as mentioned above , the symmetron model has been formulated based on a scalar field and matter interaction , undergoing symmetry breaking .",
    "an interesting consequence of symmetry breaking that appears in many different physical theories is that of _ domain walls _",
    "topologically , domain walls can form if the field potential has disconnected vacua @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in cosmology and during the early universe , it is assumed that the cosmic medium cools as it expands , so that cosmological phase transitions could occur due to the breaking of fundamental symmetries @xcite .",
    "formerly , cosmological domain walls were expected to form during a symmetry breaking in the early universe via a second - order phase transition , through a process known as the kibble mechanism @xcite and it was speculated that they lead to the formation of large - scale structures . however , since no observational evidence has yet been found in favour of such objects in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) , such a scenario is nowadays usually discarded .    as mentioned before",
    ", scalar fields with a strong coupling to matter can be present in the universe while invisible to local observations",
    ". this may be so if these fields are subject to a screening mechanism , such as in the symmetron model .",
    "note that in this model , regions of high density shield the fifth force resulting from the scalar field .",
    "in fact , in @xcite , a structure formation analysis in the symmetron model via @xmath1body simulations confirms the suppression of the scalar fifth force in high - density regions .",
    "moreover , the properties of domain walls in the symmetron model have been studied in @xcite , where numerical simulations of representative interactions between domain walls and matter over - densities have been investigated .    in the present paper , motivated by the symmetron model , we analyse the dynamics ( collapse / expansion ) of spherical domain walls which are governed by popular scalar field theory potentials capable of producing domain walls .",
    "we will present several ways of doing analytical and numerical calculations showing the collapse ( or expansion ) of the spherical domain wall , with / without the gravitational interaction and with / without direct interaction between the symmetron field @xmath2 and the matter .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section [ sym ] , we present a short review of the symmetron model and consider alternative potentials that will be analysed throughout the paper . in section [ wom ] , we calculate the collapse of a spherical domain wall for each model , followed by a simple analytical model which closely agrees with the numerical results . in section [ wm ] ,",
    "we discuss the evolution of spherical domain walls in the presence of central matter density .",
    "section [ gravity ] involves the gravitational effects of the central mass as well as the self gravity of the domain wall through a collective coordinate approximation .",

    "while the bubble which is formed in the first case ( @xmath120 ) is double layered , the bubble of the second case ( @xmath162 ) does not have any sub - layers .",
