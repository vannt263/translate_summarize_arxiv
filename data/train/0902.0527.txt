    "massive star colliding wind systems continue to be an area of intense study .",
    "the colliding wind interaction region ( cwir ) is intrinsically interesting as a problem of hydrodynamic flow ( girard & willson 1987 ; shore & brown 1988 ; stevens , blondin , & pollock 1992 ; usov 1992 ; canto , raga , & wilkin 1996 ; gayley , owocki , & cranmer 1997 ) .",
    "the cwirs lead to a number of interesting observable effects as well , such as the x - ray emissions ( e.g. , stevens  1996 ; maeda  1999 ; zhekov & skinner 2000 ; pittard  2002 ; henley , stevens , & pittard 2003 ) , ultraviolet ( uv ) , optical , and infrared ( ir ) emission line profile effects ( e.g. , stevens 1993 ; lhrs 1997 ; stevens & howarth 1999 ; hill  2000 ; hill , moffat , & st - louis 2002 ) , dust emission ( e.g. , tuthill , monnier , & danchi 1999 ; monnier , tuthill , & danchi 1999 ; tuthill  2006 ; tuthill  2008 ) , and polarization ( e.g. , brown , mclean , & emslie 1978 ; drissen  1986 ; villar - sbaffi  2003 , 2005 , 2006 ) . of chief interest between relating the observables to the hydrodynamical predictions",
    "are the determinations of the mass - loss rates for the two stars , their orbital properties , and the opening angle of the colliding wind bow shock .",
    "obtaining the orbital solution implies deriving the masses of the two stars , which is important for understanding massive star evolution . as is typical with unresolved binary systems , the viewing inclination @xmath1 creates a challenge to obtaining the full orbital solution and stellar masses .    in the study of cwirs of massive binaries ,",
    "the interpretation of optically thin lines remains prominent , such as x - ray lines that encode information about opening angle and viewing inclination .",
    "one area that has been largely ignored is the influence of the cwir on the _ shape _ of forbidden emission line profiles , especially those in the ir .",
    "the _ infrared space observatory _ ( ` _ iso _ ' ) and the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( _spitzer_ ) have provided a large quantity of high quality ir spectra for massive stars . especially in the case of the evolved wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars ,",
    "the ir spectra are rich in emission lines and in particular forbidden lines .",
    "these forbidden lines have been useful for deriving or constraining gaseous abundances that are relevant for testing models of massive star evolution ( e.g. , barlow , roche , & aitken 1988 ; willis  1997 ; dessart  2000 ; morris  2000 ; morris , crowther , & houck 2004 ; smith & houck 2005 ; ignace  2007 ) .",
    "an interesting property of these forbidden lines is that they form at large radius in the wind of a wr star .",
    "consequently , the line formation occurs well beyond the wind acceleration thus sampling the flow at the wind terminal speed @xmath2 .",
    "being optically thin these forbidden lines should be flat - topped in shape , and so they are excellent for measuring @xmath2 values ( barlow  1988 ) .",
    "but the flat - topped profile morphology only holds if the wind is spherically symmetric .",
    "if a wr star is part of a binary , then even if the wr wind is intrinsically spherically symmetric , the cwir ensures that it will not remain so .",
    "equally interesting is the fact that forbidden lines can form over tens of thousands of wr stellar radii ( e.g. , ignace  2001 ) , corresponding to scales of several au and comparable to binary separations in massive star binaries . as a result",
    ", forbidden emission profiles should not be flat - topped in general in these systems , and their deviation from flat - top  like the case for other cwir emission line diagnostics  can be used to constrain the properties of the cwir geometry .    in this paper",
    "we calculate a range of forbidden line profile shapes as a function of wind and orbit parameters .",
    "section 2 presents a brief overview of forbidden line formation , a derivation of emission profiles in a spherical wind , and then in a colliding wind system .",
    "then section 3 describes applications to two systems : wr  147 and @xmath0  vel . concluding remarks are given in section 4",
    "our presentation of the theory of forbidden line emission generally follows osterbrock ( 1989 ) regarding the atomic physics , barlow  ( 1988 ) for application to winds , and ignace & brimeyer ( 2006 ) for notation .",
    "the following sections describe ( a ) the two - level approximation for forbidden lines , ( b ) the solution for the forbidden line emission in a spherical wind , ( c ) the adopted model used to describe a cwir between a wr  star and an ob star , and ( d ) adjustments to the forbidden line profile calculation arising from the cwir .      for simplicity",
    "the two - level atom approximation is adopted for a fine structure transition of an ion species .",
    "the lower level will be ` 1 ' and the upper level ` 2 ' .",
    "it is common to introduce a critical density @xmath3 that signifies the transition from the higher density medium where de - excitations are dominated by collisions versus the lower density zone where spontaneous decay dominates . since excitation is assumed to derive from collisions _ only _ , the emissivity transitions from a function that is linear in density in the collisional regime to one that is quadratic in density in the decay regime .",
    "the critical density is defined as    @xmath4    where @xmath5 [ s@xmath6 is the einstein a - value for the transition , and @xmath7 is the downward volume collisional de - excitation rate [ @xmath8 s@xmath6 .",
    "the volume emissivity @xmath9 [ erg s@xmath10 @xmath11 sr@xmath6 is    @xmath12    in the two level atom , the entire density of elemental species @xmath13 in ion stage @xmath1 is given by @xmath14 .",
    "one can derive the ratio @xmath15 from equilibrium conditions and use that to solve for the population of the upper level : ( barlow  1988 ) :    @xmath16    where    @xmath17    with    @xmath18    for @xmath19 the frequency of the line transition , @xmath20 the electron temperature , and @xmath21 the statistical weight of the level , with @xmath22 .",
    "the downward collisional volume rate is given by    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the collision strength .",
    "a summary of line transition data and critical densities is given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for emission from the compression region , the density is enhanced by a constant factor of 4 in our treatment . in terms of the emission per unit solid angle , @xmath25",
    ", the integration along a hypothetical radial that lies entirely within the compression layer will be 8 times greater than for one in a purely spherical wind .",
    "of course , the compression layer has a solid angle extent that is 1/4 that of the cavity . in effect , the wind collision redistributes mass in a sector of the wr  flow , and there is a net gain in line emission above what that sector would have produced if it were undisturbed .",
    "the wind collision leads in essence to a globally stuctured clump .",
    "the important point is that one should not expect cwirs to conserve flux in the forbidden line as compared to a spherical wind .",
    "also , the cwir does not extend down to the photosphere of the wr  star , but is significantly offset in radius , as determined by the location of the stagnation point on the line of centers between the two stars and the width of the compressed wr  wind .",
    "this means there is a minimum radius to the cwir , interior to which a spherical wr  wind makes a simple flat - top contribution to the line profile .",
    "example profiles for the conical bow shock approximation are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] for different binary separations relative to the critical radius @xmath26 , cavity opening angles @xmath27 , and viewing inclinations @xmath1 .",
    "model parameters for the different panels are provided in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "the principle conclusions are that : ( a ) only a pole - on view to the orbit produces a symmetric profile , with a double - horned appearance , ( b ) an edge - on view produces one that is maximally lopsided , and ( c ) generally an asymmetric double - horned profile shape results whose appearance relates to the viewing perspective and orbital parameters . note that these profiles have been gaussian smoothed to simulate limited spectral resolution . given that typical wr winds have @xmath28 , smoothing with a gaussian of hwhm @xmath29 was adopted to match roughly the resolution of _ iso _ s sws06 instrument ( de graauw  1996 ) .    finally , all of the examples in figure  [ fig3 ] have _ excess _ emission relative to a purely spherical wind by factors of 10 - 20% .",
    "it happens that the total line flux as a function of the opening angle and binary separation is derivable analytically .",
    "there are four basic zones .",
    "as previously noted for radii @xmath30 , the wr wind is spherical and contributes a flat - top contribution to the profile . in the cavity sector , there is no contribution .",
    "then there is the spherical zone and the compressed layer for @xmath31 .",
    "accounting for these zones , the solution for the line luminosity , relative to a pure spherical wind , is denoted by @xmath32 and given by    @xmath33 ,      \\label{eq : lineflux}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath34    in the limit that @xmath35 , equation  ( [ eq : lineflux ] ) reduces to unity , as it must because there is no cwir . for two identical winds ,",
    "the opening angle is @xmath36 , and the maximum line flux for a given value of @xmath37 becomes :    @xmath38    if the binary orbit is exceedingly large , @xmath39 is again recovered because the cwir is displaced to a location of irrelevance with @xmath40 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath41 , all the arctangent factors reduce to @xmath42 , thus    @xmath43    formally this has a maximum of 1.75 .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows @xmath44 as a percentage excess of line emission above the spherical value as a function of @xmath45 .",
    "the different curves are for different @xmath27 values , from 0 to 90 degrees in 10 degree increments , with the excess being greater for larger @xmath27 .",
    "the location of maximum _ percentage _ excess can be derived from equation  ( [ eq : lineflux ] ) and occurs at @xmath46 for all @xmath27 .",
    "these curves are accurate only within the assumptions for the adopted geometry .",
    "a different set of curves would result for example if the relation between @xmath47 and @xmath27 were different .",
    "also , for ease of calculation , the bow shock exists for @xmath48 and not at all for interior radii , which is incorrect because this neglects the shape of the head of the bow shock .",
    "the exercise does serve to demonstrate that ( a ) colliding wind effects will generally not conserve line flux , ( b ) line flux excesses at the level of @xmath49 can be expected , ( c ) the excess will depend on the clumping factor in the large - scale wind , and ( d ) elemental abundance determinations for wr winds from forbidden lines formed in colliding wind systems are not dramatically biased by the cwir",
    ". however , it may be that changes in ionization between the nominal spherical wind and the compressed layer could have a larger systematic influence that would need to be investigated more carefully in detailed simulations .",
    "we attempt to include such affects in our consideration of applications to wr  147 and @xmath0  vel in section  3 .      for spiral - shaped interaction regions when binary orbital effects are important , issues that influence the profile shape are similar as for the conical shaped regions of the last section .",
    "however , there are a few more important factors to bear in mind .",
    "the spiral is still symmetric about the orbital plane .",
    "that means the line profile should be symmetric about zero velocity for a pole - on inclination of the system .",
    "however , when edge - on the spiral shape now allows the interaction region to transit ( eventually ) _ every _ isovelocity zone , thereby tending to dilute the influence of non - sphericity in the profile shape .",
    "another important factor is that the direction of orbital revolution with respect to the observer will be relevant .",
    "one expects the following trends to hold :    1 .",
    "larger opening angles lead to profile structure over a greater range of observed velocity shifts .",
    "flat - top segments seen toward the line wings places a limit on @xmath50 .",
    "the total line luminosity derivation of equation  ( [ eq : lineflux ] ) for the conical interaction regions remains relevant for the spiral case . with the assumption of constant solid angles ,",
    "the proportions of the cavity and compressed layer to a spherical shell are constant with radius .",
    "this means that a spiral interaction region is simply a conical one with radius - depdendent phase lags . however , those curves require a correction for the extension of the emission cavity down to the stagnation point in regimes where that portion impacts the line emission .",
    "when the wrapping radius is relatively small , the profile shape tends to deviate _",
    "less _ from a flat - topped appearance , for most viewing inclinations .",
    "the compressed layer leads to line emission being sensitive to the outer spiral shape even when the wrapping radius is somewhat large .",
    "the last point is interesting , and is highlighted in figure  [ fig5 ] which also provides a test of our code for general orbits against the semi - analytic case of a conical bow shock .",
    "the figure is organized in four columns . from bottom to top , the viewing inclination ranges from pole - on to edge - on through angles of @xmath51 and @xmath52 . from left to right for the first three columns , the orbital period is 1 year , 100 years , and 10,000 years .",
    "profiles in the far right column are for the purely conical cwir described in the previous section .",
    "the orbits are taken as circular , with @xmath53 so that the cwir exists essentially everywhere .",
    "the profile shapes have not been gaussian smoothed .",
    "the bow shock has @xmath54 and the compressed layer has @xmath55 in each instance .",
    "note that the vertical scales ( not shown ) are the same within a row but vary between rows .    for the longest period case ,",
    "the profiles in the third column match those of the strict conical bow shock case in the fourth column .",
    "what is surprising is that models with @xmath56 years for which the wrapping radius is larger than the critical radius by two orders of magnitude deviate from the expectations of the conical bow shock case .",
    "the reason is that the emission in the compressed zone is very large .",
    "the factor of 4 increase in density combined with the density square emissivity dependence in the outer wind along with the narrowness of the zone leads to relatively ` spikey ' features in velocity that appear in the line profile .",
    "of course with instrumental smearing , the significance of these features will be substantially reduced . also note that since the geometry is fixed , all the profiles should have the same flux , which we have confirmed .",
    "it is clear that diverse profiles can result . even for the highly controlled examples of figure  [ fig5 ] , and",
    "with some instrumental smoothing , profiles can be largely symmetric or strikingly not so ; they may have two peaks , three peaks , or possibly four ; and some profiles can be nearly flat - topped in shape , or have flat - top segments .",
    "it is difficult to explore the parameter space exhaustively owing to the large number of free parameters , namely @xmath1 , @xmath27 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 plus the orbit direction , so a limited selection of illustrative results are shown in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "these have been convolved with a gaussian of hwhm @xmath61 .",
    "each panel is labeled .",
    "the two longer panels at right are for pole - on and edge - on viewing inclinations in which the semi - major axis takes values of @xmath62 , five profiles for each case from bottom to top .",
    "the orbits are circular , and there are five opening angles @xmath63 degrees .",
    "the orbital period is 1 year .",
    "@xmath0  vel .",
    "the four panels at left are for more restricted variations in the parameters as listed .",
    "generally @xmath64 year , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and the periastron and companion star are both located at @xmath69 for these models .",
    "the top panel shows variations in @xmath70 from 0.01 to 100 years in factors of ten from bottom top . for eccentricity ,",
    "@xmath71 , again from bottom to top .",
    "the periastron location varies from 0 to 160 degrees in 40 degree increments ; the same variation is used for the location of the star . note",
    "that relative to a spherical wind , the line fluxes are never in excess by more than 23% for this set of models , with an average excess of about 7% .",

    "this means that the low ionization states of calcium , neon , and sulfur that contribute to the ir forbidden line emissions simply will not exist in this sector at all .",

    "although our treatment of the bow shock head is very approximate , its shortcomings are not likely to suppress a three - horned morphology .",
    "wolf - rainer hamann ( private comm . ) indicates that in the potsdam models of wr  winds , the ionization balance is still not ` frozen - in ' for wc models even out to the edge of their computational grid at @xmath123 .",
    "an example of this can be seen in figure  7 of grfener , koesterke , & hamann ( 2002 ) where at the lowest wind densities in the model , ion fractions are still changing with radius .",

    "note that changing @xmath125 to increasingly positive values tends to move the line formation deeper into the wind , because the line luminosity scales as    @xmath132    in addition , the larger density in the compressed layer , by a factor of 4 , tends to enhance recombination , and so for our models , we allow @xmath133 in the shocked layer .",
    "comparisons to detailed radiative transfer calculations , such as those of the potsdam group or cmfgen ( hillier & miller 1999 ) , are needed to assess the plausibility of the selected @xmath125 values .",
    "although motivated by the ionization considerations , @xmath134 mainly acts as an additional weighting function to shift the predominant region of line formation in radius .    ultimately , our profile modeling still falls short of accurately reproducing the observed emission lines .",

    "first , [ neiii ] always shows a more or less double - horned morphology , never triple - horned as observed .",
    "second , using the ephemeris of north  ( 2007 ) , we have determined the orbital phase of @xmath0  vel for the _ iso _ line data .",
    "according to north , the o star orbits counter - clockwise on the sky , and so the cwir spirals outward in a clockwise fashion . according to the _ iso _ archive , the data were obtained on 1996 may 17 at 23:36:24 , or mjd 50220.9836 . using the observation of north  on mjd 50120.4 and a period of @xmath136 days",
    ", the o star is 28% of an orbit past periastron in time , which corresponds to an orbital phase of @xmath137 . in our simulations",
    "this is close to a phase of @xmath138 that is plotted as a dashed line .",
    "thus , the second problem is that we can not simulaneously get all four profiles with the overall grossly correct morphologies at quite the same phase .",
    "note that at a nearby phase of @xmath139 , the [ neii ] line does show a triple peak .",
    "our study concerns model calculations for forbidden emission line profile shapes that form in a colliding wind system .",
    "the approach recognizes that spherically symmetric winds produce optically thin and flat - topped emission line shapes produced in the constant expansion flow .",
    "deviations from that flat - top morphology represents an opportunity to infer information about the orbital properties of the binary and the colliding wind bow shock .",
    "our approach makes a number of significant simplifications to make the problem tractable : the ob companion wind makes no contribution to the line emission , flow in the compressed layer is radial and with the same speed as the wr wind , the extent of the shocked layer is only approximate , the geometry of the bow shock head is treated poorly , the bow shock is assumed axisymmetric about the line of centers for the two stars , and more input regarding the ionization balance in the large scale wind is needed to model line shapes properly .    in light of all of these shortcomings",
    ", the models do produce a remarkable degree of diverse profile morphologies .",
    "although even qualitative matches to observed forbidden lines from wr  147 and @xmath0  vel are far from satisfactory , the attempt does appear to capture a number of trends and shows potential as a tool for deducing or limiting orbital and wind parameters .",
    "although of lower spectral resolution than _ iso _ , we determined that the _ spitzer _",
    "irs could probably detect modulations of ir forbidden line shapes with orbital phase .",
    "unfortunately , the irs will not be available during _",
    "spitzer s _ `` warm '' cycle .",
    "it is expected that the james webb space telescope will have a mid - infrared spectrograph with a resolving power similar to _ iso_. in addition , the [ neii ] emission line is observable from ground - based observatories , as for example in the study of smith & houck ( 2001 ) .",
    "in particular , their sample included wr  146 which has quite broad lines owing to a wind terminal speed of nearly 3000 km s@xmath10 .",
    "so there is the possibility that future observations will provide new high quality data of these and other systems for which our diagnostics will be relevant .",
    "we wish to thank ken gayley for helpful discussions in the early stages of this project .",
    "we are also grateful a number of useful suggestions made by an anoymous referee .",
    "this project was funded by a partnership between the national science foundation ( nsf ast-0552798 ) , research experiences for undergraduates ( reu ) , and the department of defense ( dod ) assure ( awards to stimulate and support undergraduate research experiences ) programs .",
