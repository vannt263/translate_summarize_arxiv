    "the study of brownian motion , and markov processes based on it , has been a rapidly growing subject in both mathematics and physics since einstein s pioneering paper @xcite , linking the macroscopic heat flow to microscopic brownian motion .",
    "the rigorous probability theoretical formulation is due to wiener @xcite , leading to a well - defined feynman - kac path integral representation for solutions of the heat equation .",
    "remarkable non - trivial results , as the non - differentiability of brownian paths @xcite , follow from wiener s construction .",
    "today , brownian motion is a very active area of research in both pure mathematics and physics @xcite @xcite @xcite , as well as in applications to a wide variety of phenomena in nature and finance @xcite .",
    "multi - particle brownian systems with dynamical creation and annihilation of particles , such as branching and dying processes , are conventionally studied by non - linear extensions of the heat equation . such a treatment ,",
    "however , requires tailor - made kinematics for each individual system at hand , in order to encode an intrinsically multi - particulate problem in the formalism of a single heat equation .",
    "this method becomes almost prohibitively difficult in application to the currently intensively studied catalytic processes @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to remedy this situation and to devise a generical kinematical framework for _ any _ brownian process featuring a dynamically changing particle number .",
    "+ our investigation starts with the crucial observation that the phase space of the heat equation carries a product structure , in contrast to the complex structure of the phase space for the schrdinger equation .",
    "the same way in which the latter gives rise to the ubiquitous occurrence of the complex numbers in quantum theory , the product structure can be absorbed into the commutative unit ring @xmath0 of pseudo - complex numbers , governing the kinematics of brownian particles .",
    "the study of one - particle brownian motion then becomes a hilbert module theory over @xmath0 , where the non - differentiability of brownian paths emerges as a direct consequence of the pseudo - complex structure of heat phase space .",
    "this thorough geometrical understanding of the one - particle case can then be put to use in the construction of multi - particle systems , employing a fock space approach .",
    "in contrast to the conventional treatment , the presented pseudo - complex hilbert module description of the single particle is extended to a _ model - independent _ fock space formalism , and the dynamics of an operator - valued second quantized field are derived . in this set - up",
    ", we discuss general interacting pseudo - complex quantum field theories as the appropriate kinematical framework for the discussion of brownian processes with non - constant particle number .    in general , the advantage of this field theoretical point of view is that one can easily write down models for arbitrarily complex brownian processes .",
    "ideally , these models have exactly solvable dyson - schwinger equations",
    ". otherwise , a truncated series expansion of interesting quantities in terms of feynman diagrams may be just the appropriate tool to extract information on analytically inaccessible systems .",
    "the abstract formalism is applied to the classically well - studied binary branching brownian motion .",
    "the dyson - schwinger equations of this system can be exactly solved , and coincide with the equations of motion that are found classically for corresponding quantities . a point in case",
    "is the reproduction of the extinction probability for such a process , which appears as the dressed one - point function in the pseudo - complex quantum field theory .",
    "the formalism is versatile enough to embrace models with dynamical catalysts , which currently receive much attention @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "section ii reviews the conventional treatment of multi - particle brownian processes for the benefit of the non - specialist reader .",
    "section iii identifies the product structure of the heat phase space , and introduces the pseudo - complex ring .",
    "section iv discusses a single brownian particle in a pseudo - complex hilbert module formalism , preparing the non - interacting multi - particle theory developed in section v. section vi studies theories with dynamical particle creation and annihilation .",
    "these abstract developments are applied to the binary branching model and a self - intoxicating particle in section vii .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section viii .",
    "the brownian motion of a single particle is well - understood and can be given a rigorous probability theoretical description .",
    "more complex systems , such as spatial branching processes , are of current research interest @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "they are conventionally studied as extensions of the single - particle problem , but the kinematical framework has to be adapted from case to case .",
    "this section briefly reviews some of the well - studied processes derived from brownian motion for the non - specialist reader , and closes with a critical discussion .",
    "in particular , we will argue that a general framework for the study of systems with non - constant particle number is desirable , such that a system is completely specified by its dynamical equations , without the need to adapt the underlying concepts .",
    "the construction of such a system - independent kinematical framework for brownian processes is the aim of this paper .",
    "recall that the _ heat equation _ is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a real - valued field on non - relativistic space time @xmath3 , and the diffusion constant is set to unity . given the initial condition @xmath4 , the linear partial differential equation ( [ heat ] ) has a unique solution .",
    "its physical significance is the following : suppose the function @xmath5 represents the temperature at time @xmath6 and position @xmath7 , then starting with the initial temperature distribution @xmath8 , the heat equation describes the heat flow in time . in this sense ,",
    "the heat equation governs the _ macroscopic _ behaviour of the temperature field .    in 1905",
    ", einstein discovered the relation between the heat equation and a stochastic process @xcite called _",
    "brownian motion_. intuitively , this process describes the _ microscopic _ behaviour of a _ single particle _ that contributes to the heat .",
    "mathematically speaking , a brownian motion with start in @xmath9 is a stochastic process , i.e. , a random path @xmath10 which is continuous and has independent , stationary and normally distributed increments .",
    "a brownian motion can therefore be considered , in a rigorous probabilistic manner @xcite , as a random element of the canonical wiener space @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a measure on the space @xmath13 of continuous paths in @xmath14 equipped with the @xmath15-field @xmath16 which is generated by the family of projections @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the wiener measure @xmath12 satisfies , for all times @xmath19 and all borel sets @xmath20 , the relation @xmath21 where the transition density of brownian motion is given by the heat kernel @xmath22 the initial value problem for the classical heat equation , @xmath23 is solved using the brownian semigroup operators @xmath24 , @xmath25 i.e. , as a linear superposition of the fundamental solutions @xmath26 .    the semigroup property of the operator @xmath24 , @xmath27 implies the so - called markov property of brownian motion , i.e. , any point on the brownian path can be considered as the starting point of a new brownian motion . in terms of the transition density @xmath26",
    ", the markov property hence takes the form @xmath28 by definition of the expectation , we can rewrite ( [ sg ] ) as an integral over the space of continuous functions with respect to the wiener measure @xmath12 , @xmath29 hence , the solution of the initial value problem for the classical heat equation can be represented either using the brownian semigroup or , equivalently , as a path integral .",
    "an important characteristic of brownian paths was found by paley , wiener and zygmund @xcite , who showed that with respect to the wiener measure , almost all brownian paths are nowhere differentiable .",
    "we will come back to this point in section [ sec_singlesystem ] .",
    "+ we emphasize that the heat equation ( [ heat ] ) describes a _ single _ brownian particle , by the heat function @xmath5 . as in the case of the schrdinger equation , the formalism , as it stands ,",
    "can not be extended to accommodate a non - constant particle number , as this would require a non - constant number of functions @xmath30 in the dynamical equations .",
    "however , the desire to study killing and branching processes has led to the following two constructions .",
    "+      it is interesting to study the heat equation with a potential term @xmath31 , which is assumed to be bounded from below , @xmath32 given the initial condition @xmath4 , the solution to ( [ softkilled ] ) is given by the feynman - kac formula @xcite @xmath33 for a constant potential @xmath34 , the solutions @xmath5 can be interpreted as the transition densities for a _ softly killed _ brownian particle , surviving a time interval @xmath35 only with probability @xmath36 .",
    "the terminology refers to the fact that we are dealing with an inherent one - particle formalism , and killing is a matter of interpretation of the underlying random variables .",
    "this is seen most clearly when considering the continuous paths in wiener space , which do not stop at a finite parameter value ( ` hard killing ' ) , but must , in this context , rather be understood as random elements in @xmath37 , i.e. , as paths with a killing time assigned to them .",
    "this extension of the wiener space as the underlying probability space is necessary in order to encode a process with non - constant particle number , in a setting that _ by construction _ can only deal with a constant number of particles .      the standard approach to branching brownian motion @xcite is the study of trees composed of independent , softly killed one - particle brownian motions , where a dying particle gives birth to @xmath38 children , according to a probability distribution @xmath39 on @xmath40 .",
    "this is formalized by consideration of a measure - valued process @xmath41 , defined by the counting measure @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a borel set in @xmath14 . hence ,",
    "if we represent each individual particle at a point @xmath44 by a unit point mass @xmath45 and write @xmath46 for the position of the @xmath47-th particle alive at time @xmath6 , we have @xmath48 as the exponential distribution has no memory , the measure - valued process @xmath49 inherits the _ markov property _ from the underlying brownian motion . due to",
    "mc kean ( 1975 ) , the distribution of branching brownian motion can be characterized in terms of a non - linear extension of the heat equation : let @xmath50 be a positive , bounded and continuous function on @xmath51 such that @xmath52 for all @xmath53 .",
    "then the quantity @xmath54 satisfies the evolution equation @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the probability generating function of the distribution @xmath39 , controlling the fertility of a dying particle . now @xmath8 is interpreted as describing an average mass flow of the measure - valued process @xmath49 .",
    "this looks like a straightforward extension of the original heat equation by a non - linear term .",
    "however , the paths are now measure - valued , and hence we again deal with a somewhat different mathematical object , despite the formal similarity of equations ( [ heat ] ) and ( [ branching ] ) .",
    "these adaptations were necessary to construct a spatially branching model within a formalism that originally described a one - particle system .",
    "+ one can extract the extinction probability for such a branching and dying process via the following construction .",
    "denote the total mass process of the branching brownian motion @xmath49 by @xmath57 .",
    "it is well - known ( see e.g. @xcite ) that @xmath58 is a continuous time galton - watson branching process whose moment generating function is given by @xmath59 for @xmath60 ( and @xmath61 ) .",
    "the function @xmath62 solves the initial value problem @xmath63 compared to equation ( [ branching ] ) , this evolution equation is missing the laplace operator that generates the spatial evolution of the process .",
    "hence , equation ( [ dualn ] ) describes the pure branching process , without the spatial evolution . for the special case @xmath64 we have by ( [ phitilde ] ) that @xmath65 .",
    "the solution of the initial value problem ( [ dualn ] ) , with @xmath64 , hence is the extinction probability for the total mass process @xmath66 in the limit @xmath67 . in terms of the process described by ( [ branching ] )",
    ", this corresponds to the probability that the process dies out eventually .",
    "we will find equation ( [ dualn ] , @xmath68 ) as the differential form of the recurrence relation for the so - called one - point function in our field - theoretical treatment in section [ sec_bnd ] .",
    "the one - particle brownian motion is mathematically well - understood , and allows for a rigorous probability theoretical definition in terms of wiener spaces .",
    "the desire to study more complex markov processes , at the same level of mathematical rigor , led to the introduction of an exponential clock and the consideration of measure - valued paths .",
    "these generalizations of the one - particle case , however , come at the cost of an extension of the underlying probability spaces , generalizing paths @xmath69 to @xmath37 , or even measure - valued paths , as explained in the preceding subsections .",
    "the necessity to perform these rather complicated and technical adaptations roots in the fact that these more complex markov processes all feature a _ non - constant particle number _ , which must be encoded in a one - particle formalism , in a manner that varies from case to case .",
    "+ the problem of dealing with systems of non - constant particle number is not a new one , but appears naturally in relativistic quantum physics .",
    "there , the relativistic mass - energy equivalence @xmath70 allows for particle creation and annihilation , and hence is a feature of any quantum particle process at sufficiently high energy .",
    "it is clear that the schrdinger equation , @xmath71 describing the quantum behaviour of a one - particle quantum system in a potential @xmath72 , can not feature such a dynamical creation and annihilation of particles , due to the fixed number of functions @xmath50 .",
    "an adequate solution was found in form of quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "it was recognized @xcite that quantum field theory can be formally applied to the discussion of brownian motion , and vice versa , if one replaces the time @xmath6 by imaginary time @xmath73 .",
    "this ad - hoc adaptation , however , bypasses the whole construction of a canonically quantized theory starting from its classical equations .",
    "there are _ no _ insights gained as to why one has to consider imaginary time , what the underlying geometrical structures are , or why there is no interference of heat in such a treatment .",
    "in fact , there exists no well - defined measure @xcite for a feynman path integral which formally solves the schrdinger equation ( [ schroed ] ) .",
    "therefore , it seems that using quantum field theoretical methods to describe brownian processes might imply a loss in mathematical rigour . in this paper , however , we show that careful consideration of the structure of the heat phase space leads to a canonical quantization of heat , whose path integral is well - defined . + in order to understand the occurrence of the imaginary unit in the quantum mechanical path integral , it is instructive to re - write the lagrangian density for the free ( @xmath74 ) schrdinger equation ( [ schroed ] ) , @xmath75 in terms of the real and imaginary parts @xmath76 and @xmath77 of the complex - valued probability amplitude @xmath78 , @xmath79",
    "the imaginary part @xmath77 is recognized as the canonical momentum associated with the real part @xmath76 , @xmath80 and the time evolution of the field phase space point @xmath81 thus reads @xmath82 =    \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}0 & -1\\\\1&0\\end{array}\\right ] \\ ,",
    "\\frac{1}{2 }    \\delta \\ , \\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\alpha\\\\\\beta\\end{array}\\right],\\ ] ] revealing the complex structure of the field phase space of the schrdinger equation .",
    "this complex structure is the actual reason for the imaginary unit entering the exponential in the quantum mechanical analogue of the feyman - kac path integral ( [ feynmankac ] ) .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to investigate the phase space structure of the heat equation in the following section .",
    "this chapter studies the geometry of the heat phase space .",
    "the central result is the absorption of the occurring structure into the ring of pseudo - complex numbers . for the discussion of brownian motion , these play as important a rle as the complex numbers do in quantum mechanics .      in order to identify the canonical momentum associated with the heat @xmath83",
    ", we need to devise a lagrangian density for the heat equation .",
    "this , however , can only be done by introduction of a second dynamical field @xmath84 . without such ,",
    "any attempt to generate the first order time derivative in ( [ heat ] ) from a lagrangian density inevitably results in a total time derivative , and hence does not contribute to the euler - lagrange equations at all .",
    "we therefore consider the lagrangian density @xmath85 yielding the euler - lagrange equations @xmath86 we observe that the additional dynamical field @xmath84 , required by a lagrangian treatment of heat , is the canonical momentum density associated with the heat field @xmath2 , as @xmath87 the phase space picture of the heat evolution , @xmath88 =    \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}1 & 0\\\\0&-1\\end{array}\\right ] \\ , \\frac{1}{2 }    \\delta \\ , \\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\varphi\\\\\\eta\\end{array}\\right],\\ ] ] reveals that the geometry of the heat phase space is governed by a _",
    "product structure _ @xcite , i.e. the representing matrix squares to the identity . the above matrix representation of the product structure and the phase space element @xmath89 $ ] clearly depend on a particular choice of basis in phase space . in the following",
    ", we will show that there is a basis - independent formulation @xmath90 for equation ( [ heatamp ] )",
    ". the obvious similarity of ( [ heatamplitude ] ) with the schrdinger equation ( [ schroed ] ) suggests to term @xmath83 the _ heat amplitude _ , and equation ( [ heatamplitude ] ) the _ heat amplitude equation_.    consider a linear operator @xmath91 on @xmath92 , with the properties @xmath93 and @xmath94",
    ". then @xmath95 are orthogonal projection operators , i.e. , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "as @xmath98 are linearly independent over @xmath99 , they provide a basis for @xmath92 .",
    "thus the operator identity @xmath100 can be read as an eigenvalue equation for the operator @xmath91 , regarding @xmath101 as _ vectors _ of @xmath92 .",
    "this shows that the matrix representation in ( [ heatamp ] ) corresponds to the choice of the @xmath101-basis for ( [ heatamplitude ] ) .",
    "in particular , the heat amplitude is given by the @xmath92-valued function @xmath102 from this point of view , the abstract reasoning started after ( [ heatamp ] ) simply reproduced the previous results .",
    "now we note , however , that there is a _",
    "canonical multiplication _ defined on the heat phase space @xmath92 , induced by the composition of operators @xmath101 .",
    "hence , the heat phase space is not merely a vector space , but a commutative ring !",
    "we pause in our development of the physical aspects , in order to explore this structure a bit further .",
    "+      let @xmath103 be the field of real numbers @xmath99 or complex numbers @xmath104 .",
    "the pseudo - complex ring over @xmath103 @xcite is the set @xmath105 equipped with addition and multiplication laws induced by those on @xmath103 , with the additional rule that @xmath106 is a product structure , i.e. @xmath107 .",
    "it is easily verified that @xmath0 is a commutative unit ring with zero divisors @xmath108 , where @xmath109 it is often convenient to employ the zero - divisor representation of a number @xmath110 , @xmath111 the zero - divisor branches @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the only multiplicative ideals in @xmath0 , thus they are both maximal ideals . hence , the linear maps @xmath114 are the only non - trivial ring homomorphisms from @xmath0 to @xmath103 , i.e. , for all @xmath115 @xmath116 application of @xmath117 to the heat amplitude @xmath83 extracts the heat @xmath2 and antiheat @xmath84 , respectively : @xmath118 physically , this means that heat amplitudes do not interfere ( linearity ) , and that one can compose heat amplitudes for complicated processes multiplicatively from elementary ones .",
    "in other words , the extraction of heat from heat amplitudes is compatible with the markov property ( [ semigroup ] ) of brownian motion .",
    "finally , we define the linear map @xmath119 by its action @xmath120 .",
    "clearly , @xmath121 is an involution , as @xmath122 .",
    "acting on the heat amplitude , @xmath121 effects an exchange of heat and antiheat .",
    "we have seen , from the analysis of the phase space structure of the heat equation , that the heat amplitude is a pseudo - complex valued field . for the discussion of brownian motion",
    ", pseudo - complex numbers therefore play the same rle as complex numbers do in quantum mechanics .",
    "the systematic exploitation of this insight will be seen to be intimately linked to the intrinsical properties of brownian motion , like the non - differentiability of brownian paths .",
    "it is often sufficient to restrict the discussion of solutions @xmath123 of the heat amplitude equation ( [ heatamplitude ] ) to the solutions @xmath124 of the _ stationary _ heat amplitude equation @xmath125 which can be extended to solutions of the time - dependent dynamics by acting on them with the time evolution operators @xmath126 such that @xmath127 solves ( [ heatamplitude ] ) .",
    "note that the time evolution operators form a semigroup , i.e. , @xmath128 and are unitary with respect to pseudo - complex conjugation , @xmath129 in section [ sec_singlesystem ] we will identify the stationary solutions @xmath130 as elements of a hilbert module @xmath131 , and the time evolution operators ( [ timeevolop ] ) as unitary operators on @xmath131 .      equipped with the constructions of the preceding sections , we are now in a position to write down the lagrangian density ( [ heatampllag ] ) in terms of the pseudo - complex valued heat amplitude , i.e. , @xmath132 note that the lagrangian density is real - valued .",
    "for later developments , it will prove useful to consider a slightly more general form , namely including a quadratic term @xmath133 which will be seen to give rise to an exponential clock with clock rate @xmath134 .",
    "observe that the euler - lagrange equations for ( [ clockmodel ] ) yield the equation of motion ( [ softkilled ] ) for softly killed brownian motion with a constant potential @xmath135 .",
    "then the canonically conjugate fields to @xmath136 are @xmath137 and we obtain the hamiltonian density @xmath131 as the legendre transform of @xmath138 , @xmath139 we observe that the hamiltonian density is real - valued , such that the hamiltonian @xmath140 can be consistently interpreted as the energy of the heat amplitude field .",
    "for the intended development of the multi - particle theory in section [ sec_multi ] , a thorough understanding of the one - particle system is inevitable . it is convenient to introduce a basis free dirac notation for the heat amplitude equation ( [ heatamplitude ] ) , in terms of a hilbert module formalism .",

    "we further call an operator @xmath153 _ real _ if @xmath154 .",
    "it follows immediately that a self - adjoint real operator on @xmath131 is a self - adjoint operator on @xmath147 .",
