    "in the fundamental work @xcite roger penrose introduced an elegant geometric `` cut and paste '' method for construction of impulsive spherical gravitational waves in a flat background .",
    "this is based on cutting minkowski space along a null cone and then re - attaching the two pieces with a suitable warp .",
    "an explicit class of such spacetimes , using coordinates in which the metric functions are continuous across the impulse , was subsequently given by nutku and penrose @xcite , hogan @xcite and , to include a nonvanishing cosmological constant , in @xcite .",
    "an additional acceleration parameter can also be introduced @xcite .",
    "this gives the complete family of expanding spherical waves of a very short duration which propagate in minkowski , de sitter or anti - de  sitter universe , that is in spacetimes with a constant curvature ( zero , positive or negative , respectively ) .",
    "such solutions can naturally be understood as impulsive limits of robinson  trautman type - n vacuum solutions @xcite , namely a suitable family of spherical sandwich waves of this type @xcite .",
    "a stereographic interpretation of complex spatial coordinate involved in the penrose junction condition across the impulse can be used for an explicit construction of specific solutions of this type , in particular those which describe impulsive spherical waves generated by colliding and snapping cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "first such solution given already in @xcite represents the snapping of a cosmic string , identified by a deficit angle in the region outside the spherical impulsive gravitational wave .",
    "the collision and breaking of a pair of cosmic strings can also be described in this way .",
    "the particular solution for a spherical gravitational impulse generated by a snapping cosmic string in minkowski space was alternatively described by bik and schmidt  @xcite .",
    "this was obtained as a limiting case of the bonnor ",
    "swaminarayan solution for an infinite acceleration of a pair of curzon  chazy particles ( see chapter  15 of @xcite ) .",
    "it was observed in @xcite that such situation is equivalent to the splitting of an infinite cosmic string as described in  @xcite or , rather , of two semi - infinite cosmic strings approaching at the speed of light and separating again at the instant at which they `` collide '' .",
    "the same explicit solution was also obtained in the limit of an infinite acceleration in the more general class which represents a pair of uniformly accelerating particles with an arbitrary multipole structure @xcite , or as an analogous limit of the c - metric which describes accelerating black holes @xcite . in the latter case , a nonvanishing cosmological constant",
    "can also be considered .",
    "this leads to a specific expanding spherical impulse generated by a snapping cosmic string in the ( anti-)de  sitter universe @xcite .",
    "more details concerning these impulsive metrics and other references can be found in the review works @xcite and in chapter  20 of @xcite .",
    "note also that particle creation and other quantum effects in such spacetimes were investigated , e.  g. , by hortasu and his collaborators @xcite .",
    "the main objective of the present work is to study specific properties of these spacetimes , namely the motion of test particles influenced by the spherical impulsive waves .",
    "in fact , podolsk and steinbauer in @xcite already investigated and described the behavior of exact geodesics in the case when the impulse expands in minkowski flat space",
    ". here we will generalize this study to any value of the cosmological constant , i.e. , we will analyze the effects on geodesics when the spherical impulse expands in de sitter or anti - de sitter universe . moreover , we will present the results in a form which is more convenient for physical and geometric interpretation .",
