    "scalar fields are ubiquitous in physics , either as a proxy for more complex interactions or as fundamental quantities in their own right . for example , one of the best studied modifications to general relativity is scalar - tensor gravity , in which space - time curvature couples to scalar fields ( which are sufficiently light to be relevant for astrophysics and/or cosmology ) .",
    "the historical development of this theory goes back to the 1940s , and involves several research groups with different views on the physical interpretation of the scalar degree of freedom @xcite . in recent times ,",
    "interest in scalar - tensor gravity has been driven by theoretical attempts to unify gravity with quantum mechanics at high energies and solve the cosmological constant and hierarchy problems , as well as observations of the cosmic microwave background and the highly - anticipated direct detection of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "the simplest version of scalar - tensor gravity is brans - dicke theory @xcite , which consists of a single massless scalar @xmath0 , whose coupling to curvature is controlled by a dimensionless parameter @xmath1 .",
    "generalizations include varying scalar - curvature couplings @xmath2 and a scalar potential @xmath3 ( `` bergmann - wagoner '' theories @xcite ) as well as the possibility of multiple interacting scalar fields : see e.g. @xcite for comprehensive treatments of the subject . these generalizations ( commonly referred to as `` scalar - tensor theories '' ) are compelling due to their simplicity , but ( perhaps as a consequence ) they are also very well constrained observationally .",
    "the classic book by will @xcite presents an overview of the subject , and comprehensive reviews of the state of the art in experimental tests of gravitational theories can be found in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall focus , for simplicity , on scalar - tensor theories involving a single scalar field .",
    "in general relativity , because of the conservation of total momentum for isolated systems , gravitational radiation is quadrupolar in nature .",
    "a possible smoking gun of scalar - tensor gravity is the existence of dipole radiation , essentially due to violations of the equivalence principle .",
    "solar system experiments and observations of binary pulsar systems place strong constraints on the coupling functions of the theory @xcite , and other interesting constraints may come from the direct observation of gravitational radiation from binary systems in the near future @xcite . despite all of these observational constraints , striking and potentially observable astrophysical phenomena are still possible in these theories .",
    "such phenomena include superradiant instabilities ( see e.g. @xcite for discussions of this phenomenon in the context of the `` string axiverse '' scenario @xcite ) and the related possibility of floating orbits around rotating black holes ( bhs ) @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies impose remarkable constraints and limitations on scalar - tensor theories .",
    "first of all , the famous bh no - scalar - hair theorems first proved by hawking @xcite , thorne and dykla @xcite , and chase @xcite state that stationary bh solutions in brans - dicke theory are the same as those in general relativity .",
    "these results have been generalized and expanded upon by many authors . for example , an extension to multiple scalars has been established by heusler @xcite , and an extension to bergmann - wagoner and @xmath4 theories has been established by sotiriou and faraoni @xcite .",
    "the no - scalar - hair theorems have also been confirmed by numerical studies of gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "more generally , it has been observed that the kerr metric is a solution in a wide class of gravity theories @xcite .",
    "however , the fact that stationary vacuum solutions of scalar - tensor theories agree with those of general relativity does not mean that the dynamics of bhs in these theories must be the same @xcite .    for a comprehensive discussion and literature survey of no - hair theorems ,",
    "the reader is referred to the reviews of bekenstein @xcite and chruciel , costa , and heusler @xcite .",
    "although the literature is vast , there are two basic assumptions lying at the heart of most no - hair theorems .",
    "the first is that of stationarity , whose necessity has been demonstrated by jacobson s `` miracle hair growth formula , '' a perturbative construction of a hairy bh with time - dependent scalar boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the second assumption is the truncation of the scalar - tensor action to second order in the derivative expansion . at this level , the most general action [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : sctens_action_jf ] ) in the single - scalar case ] is very simple and contains only three terms , whereas scalar - tensor gravity at the four - derivative level is too complicated to be studied in complete generality , and thus , attention is often restricted to particular models .",
    "one such model is quadratically modified gravity , whose action contains all possible terms quadratic in the riemann tensor , coupled to a scalar . in this theory , bhs",
    "have been studied perturbatively , and solutions with scalar hair have been found @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the special case of a scalar coupled to a topological invariant  namely , einstein - dilaton - gauss - bonnet ( edgb ) or dynamical chern - simons ( dcs ) gravity  a no - hair theorem for neutron stars has been established @xcite .",
    "the conclusion here is that spherically - symmetric neutron stars have vanishing scalar monopole moment , but higher - order scalar multipoles need not vanish .",
    "however , the presence of derivatives higher than second order in the field equations severely complicates the implementation of numerical simulations .",
    "although four - derivative actions generically lead to field equations with more than two derivatives , there are some noteworthy exceptions .",
    "one is the einstein - skyrme system , a nonlinear sigma model with target - space @xmath5 , containing a term in the action quartic in scalar derivatives , and admitting linearly - stable bh solutions with scalar hair which have been described numerically in @xcite .",
    "another model with second - order field equations is the galileon @xcite , which is related to both higher - dimensional lovelock gravity @xcite and massive gravity @xcite .",
    "it satisfies solar system constraints by means of the vainshtein mechanism @xcite , and a no - galileon - hair theorem for spherically - symmetric bhs has been recently established @xcite .",
    "another interesting example is bergmann - wagoner scalar - tensor gravity coupled to non - linear electrodynamics , where the non - vanishing trace of the electromagnetic stress - energy tensor enters as a source into the scalar - field equation .",
    "this allows for stable asymptotically - flat bhs with scalar hair , which have been studied numerically in @xcite .",
    "the `` classical '' no - hair theorems described in the preceeding paragraphs , which are statements about stationary vacuum space - times , have been extended to the context of a bh binary system . employing the `` generalized eih '' formalism developed by eardley @xcite",
    ", will and zaglauer @xcite have shown that the leading - order post - newtonian ( pn ) dynamics of a bh binary in brans - dicke theory is indistinguishable from that in general relativity . recently",
    ", this result has been extended to general scalar - tensor theories in the extreme mass - ratio limit @xcite and it has been shown to hold up to 2.5pn order for generic mass ratio @xcite .",
    "thus , even a dynamical ( vacuum ) spacetime with two interacting bhs does not have scalar hair in the pn limit .",
    "we can regard this conclusion as a `` generalized no - hair theorem . ''",
    "the generalized no - hair theorem relies on the assumption that the binary system is isolated , in the sense that cosmological and environmental effects ( say , due to the galactic background surrounding the bhs ) are neglected .",
    "more precisely , it is assumed that : ( 1 ) there is no matter in the system , ( 2 ) the scalar field has zero potential , ( 3 ) the scalar - tensor action is truncated to second order in the derivative expansion , and ( 4 ) the metric is asymptotically flat ( in all conformal frames ) and the scalar is asymptotically constant .",
    "the vacuum assumption ( 1 ) can be relaxed either by considering bhs in astrophysical environments or by considering compact stars , which are affected by the well - known spontaneous scalarization phenomenon ( cf .",
    "@xcite for recent numerical studies ) .",
    "other recent numerical studies created a scalar - field `` bubble '' around the binary by using a nonvanishing potential , i.e. relaxing assumption ( 2 ) .",
    "they found that the scalar - field bubble is rapidly accreted by the bhs , modifying the binary dynamics @xcite .",
    "as for assumption ( 3 ) , compact binary dynamics in quadratically modified gravity has been studied analytically in a perturbative framework , where one takes the point of view that the model should be considered as an effective low - energy theory @xcite . whether these theories are well posed for numerical evolutions",
    "is currently a matter of debate .",
    "we will not consider this problem in the present paper , but it is an interesting topic for future research .",
    "relaxing either assumption ( 3 ) or assumption ( 4 ) introduces a new length ( or time ) scale in the bh binary dynamics . in the case of assumption",
    "( 3 ) this scale is determined by the compton wavelength of a heavy particle , whose square enters into coefficients of four - derivative terms in the action . in the case of assumption ( 4 ) , the new scale is determined by cosmological and/or galactic effects . a priori ,",
    "it is not obvious which of these effects is dominant , and thus it is worthwhile to explore both possibilities .",
    "to our knowledge , the relaxation of assumption ( 4 ) has not been explored in the literature , and it is the main focus of our paper .",
    "asymptotic flatness of the metric is only an approximation to the dynamics of an astrophysical binary .",
    "observations show that the universe is expanding on timescales which are very large , but nevertheless finite with respect to astrophysical bh binary evolution . as shown in @xcite",
    ", imposing time - varying boundary conditions endows the bhs in a binary with scalar charge , and therefore the binary can emit dipole scalar radiation .",
    "furthermore , many cosmological models consider the existence of background scalars which can be anchored on matter @xcite . in this case , one can for instance conceive of a bh binary evolving in the background of a nearly - static but nonuniform scalar field anchored on the galactic matter .",
    "the characteristic lengthscale of such a scalar - field profile would be much larger than the binary separation , and therefore it would have the same effect on the dynamical evolution of the binary system as the enforcement of boundary conditions which are not asymptotically flat .",
    "finally , bh dynamics in the background of scalar fields could also be relevant to understanding accretion inside hypothetical supermassive boson stars , where huge scalar - field gradients are expected @xcite .",
    "scalar - field gradients can therefore allow us to circumvent the generalized no - hair theorem , i.e. , to have a spacetime which contains only bhs and still emits scalar radiation .",
    "indeed , as we shall discuss below [ cf .",
    "( [ scalarcharge ] ) , section [ appsol ] ] , in the presence of a spatially - varying scalar - field profile @xmath6 , a nonrotating bh of mass @xmath7 with world - line @xmath8 would have a scalar charge and mass @xmath7 are einstein - frame quantities , and geometrical units @xmath9 are employed , where @xmath10 is the einstein - frame bare gravitational constant .",
    "the result quoted here also assumes that the bh motion relative to the scalar - field profile is `` slow '' , in the sense that @xmath11 . ] [ qv ] q(t)&= & 4m^2 ( ( t ) ) + & = & 8 m^2 , where in the second line we have assumed that the scalar - field gradient is directed along the @xmath12-axis , and we have parametrized its magnitude by a real parameter @xmath13 . if the bh is accelerated , or if the scalar gradient is nonuniform , the scalar charge would evolve in time , yielding scalar radiation .",
    "as we show in appendix [ cosmo ] , for a stellar - mass bh ( @xmath14 ) moving near the galactic center a typical scalar - field gradient is @xmath15 . for a supermassive bh with @xmath16",
    "a typical gradient could be as large as @xmath17 , comparable in order of magnitude to the numerical simulations presented in this paper .",
    "the main goal of this work is to explore the consequences of the presence of a scalar - field gradient , which is equivalent to imposing nontrivial boundary conditions on the dynamics of a bh binary , and to verify numerically whether , as suggested by eq .",
    "( [ qv ] ) , such a setup can allow scalar radiation from a bh binary system in scalar - tensor theory . here",
    "we present an executive summary of our main results and an outline of the paper .",
    "in section  [ sec : framework ] we lay out our theoretical framework by introducing generic scalar - tensor theories and presenting the relations that allow us to transform between the jordan frame ( where physical quantities should be computed ) and the einstein frame ( where we will perform our calculations ) . in particular , we show how gravitational radiation in the jordan frame can be computed from a knowledge of the newman - penrose scalars in the einstein frame .    in section  [ sec : analytic ]",
    "we introduce analytical approximations for scalar fields in the background of single and binary bh spacetimes .",
    "these approximations are useful to validate ( and provide insight into ) our numerical simulations .",
    "in fact , numerical evolutions of initial data corresponding to a single black hole in a scalar gradient show that , after a short transient , the scalar field relaxes to the static configurations predicted by these perturbative calculations . for a quasicircular black - hole binary , in section  [ sec : analytic ]",
    "we show analytically that the dipole component of the scalar radiation is emitted at twice the binary s orbital frequency .",
    "this prediction is validated by our numerical simulations , which also show that the dipole component dominates the scalar emission .    in section [ sec : numerical ] we present the details of our numerical implementation .",
    "the results of our simulations are discussed and compared with analytical results in section [ sec : results ] . in section [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our findings and point out possible directions for future work .    to improve readability , in the appendices we collect technical material that illustrates various important points of our analysis .",
    "appendix [ app : boosted ] shows that a bh moving with constant velocity in a uniform scalar - field gradient does not emit scalar radiation .",
    "appendix [ app : binaryscaleq ] ( which is complementary to section [ appsol ] ) collects some lengthy formulas illustrating the structure of gravitational radiation from a bh binary moving in a scalar - field gradient . in appendix",
    "[ sec : evolution_equations ] we provide explicit expressions for the evolution equations used in our numerical code . in appendix [ cosmo ] we estimate the order of magnitude of the scalar - field gradients expected in scalar - field models of dark matter .",
    "we focus on general single - scalar - tensor theories in vacuum with vanishing scalar potential , and at most two derivatives in the action .",
    "these theories are equivalent to einstein s theory extended to include a minimally coupled scalar field with vanishing potential .",
    "this statement ( which will be clarified below ) has a nontrivial consequence : the addition of minimally coupled scalars to einstein s gravity allows one to study a multitude of scalar - tensor theories at once . for this reason our simple framework offers an opportunity to take a glimpse at a rather broad spectrum of physics beyond einstein s theory .",
    "our starting point is the action of a general scalar - tensor theory for a single scalar field @xmath0 , written as [ eq : sctens_action_jf ] s = d^4x ( f()r-8 g z()g^__-u ( ) ) , where @xmath18 is the ricci scalar associated to the metric @xmath19 , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are arbitrary functions ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this form of the action corresponds to the choice of the so - called `` jordan frame '' , where the scalar field is nonminimally coupled with gravity and all other matter fields obey the equivalence principle .",
    "the dynamics of matter fields would be described by an additional term @xmath22 on the right - hand side , that we set equal to zero because we are interested in bhs in vacuum .",

    "let us assume that the scalar - field gradient is of such low amplitude that the scalar can be treated as a perturbative effect on the spacetime metric .",
    "under this assumption we can neglect terms quadratic in the scalar field , and therefore the field equations reduce to @xmath36 we will drop this perturbative approximation in section [ sec : numerical ] , where the field equations ( [ eeq ] ) and ( [ seq ] ) will be solved numerically .",

    "the maximum recoil velocity from a nonspinning bh binary is of order @xmath246 @xcite , so @xmath247 even if @xmath245 approaches unity .",
    "this contribution to the dipole radiation is way too small to account for a significant portion of the drift seen in our simulations .",
    "finally , a frame - dragging effect can also contribute with a nonzero drift for the scalar field .",
    "the coalescing binary drags the inertial frames , inducing a local rotation of the coordinate lines .",
    "this induces , near the binary , an apparent rotation in the @xmath248-@xmath12 plane of the extracted scalar field , which determines a nonvanishing real part of @xmath249 .",
    "while the order of magnitude of this effect is roughly consistent with our numerical findings , the decay of the frame - dragging effect with extraction radius is not consistent with our data .",
    "therefore frame dragging is not a dominant contribution to the observed drift .",
    "while the dc component accounts for the order of magnitude of the drift observed in our numerical simulations , most likely the observed drift is due to a combination of the effects mentioned above , and possibly others . in particular , by imposing constant - gradient boundary conditions at finite distance from the binary during the evolution we are effectively injecting energy into the system .",
    "this causes a growth of the scalar field , which may contribute significantly to the drift .",
    "this expectation should be confirmed by longer simulations and/or by simulations where the `` plates '' generating the scalar gradient are located further away from the binary .",
    "we hope to return to this problem in future work .",
    "we have investigated bh dynamics in external field profiles , by considering the very simple example of a constant scalar - field gradient .",
    "the broad features of our analysis should translate to other , more general settings , at least as long as the external force varies on length- or time - scales which are larger than the typical binary separation .",
    "our results are in agreement with linear or slow - motion expansions , and show conclusively that black hole binaries evolving in a nontrivial background produce interesting scalar and gravitational - field dynamics .    as discussed in appendix [ cosmo ] ,",
    "the scalar - field profiles currently considered in scalar - field dark matter models correspond roughly to @xmath250 or less for a typical stellar - mass bh with @xmath14 . because scalar radiation is proportional to the gradient , the experimental relevance of our setting for gravitational radiation from bh binaries , as observable by advanced ligo or similar instruments , seems negligible .",
    "however , it is interesting that gravitational - wave observations may yield upper bounds on scalar field gradients at all .",
    "furthermore , our estimates in appendix [ cosmo ] predict larger field gradients for supermassive black holes with @xmath251 ; for such binary systems the gradient could reach values as large as @xmath252 , close to the values studied in this work .",

    "albeit more speculative  dark matter configurations , such as supermassive boson stars @xcite , so the possibility to come across this type of signals should be seriously taken into account .",
