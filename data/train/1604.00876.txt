    "cometary nuclei display a wide variety of terrain and geological features , ranging from pits and mountains to flat or terraced regions .",
    "the rolis descent images of 67p / c - g show grains of regolith ranging from centimeter sizes to several meters , @xcite . behind these meter - sized obstacles wind tails",
    "are resolved in the rolis images .",
    "smaller sized particles as seen by rolis have been observed in orbit by the osiris instrument , @xcite , suggesting that dust particles contribute to both , the cometary tail originating from the nucleus and to the shaping of surface structures .",
    "it has been proposed that the wind - tail structures are the result of boulders blocking impinging particles , which lead otherwise to abrasion of the surrounding terrain .",
    "no model or explanation for the impinging - particle direction indicated by the wind tails has been given , besides the hypothesis that a particle source exists at some distance ( @xcite ) .    here",
    ", we establish a predictive model for the directions of impinging particles , which does away with a single particle - source and follows the opposite hypothesis : the whole cometary surface acts as source for dust grains .",
    "the particular shape of the nucleus in combination with the coriolis force leads then to prevailing transport directions in specific regions of the comet .",
    "the same homogeneous activity model has been applied to dust particles lifted off the mantle with higher velocity and yields excellent agreement with the collimated dust structures seen by rosetta around 67/c - g within a few cometary radii , @xcite .",
    "the homogeneous surface - activity model works with a minimal set of parameters and assumptions , summarized as follows : ( i ) incorporation of cometary topography on a scale down to @xmath0  m to ensure a dense and uniform sampling of the entire terrain , ( ii ) accurate computation of the gravitational potential for the partially concave shape of the nucleus , and ( iii ) full inclusion of the rotation of the nucleus .",
    "in particular the rotation of the nucleus has a decisive role for establishing dust transport - vectors on the surface and for higher velocities into space .",
    "slower dust trajectories ( @xmath1  m / s ) are strongly affected by the velocity dependent coriolis force , which pushes particles on circular orbits within a few kilometers around the comet .",
    "in a coordinate - system attached to the cometary body , the acceleration of a dust particle is approximated by @xmath2 which includes the acceleration of dust embedded in the more rapidly expanding gas , the gravitational force and the effect of rotation ( centrifugal and coriolis forces ) .",
    "additional forces , such as radiation pressure , changes in the rotation period or orientation of the rotation axis are neglected .",
    "for instance , the acceleration due to radiation pressure on a 0.1  mm sized spherical dust particle at the perihelion ( 1.25  au ) is one order of magnitude smaller than the gravitational attraction by the nucleus .",
    "we compute the gravitational potential of the irregular and partly concave shape of 67p / c - g by using a @xmath3 triangles polyhedral representation .",
    "assumptions are a homogeneous density of the nucleus and a total mass of @xmath4  kg , @xcite .",
    "the polyhedral gravity equations given by @xcite are numerically efficiently implemented and the dust trajectories are integrated on parallel computing devices using a fourth order runge - kutta integration scheme .",
    "in contrast to previous simulations done by @xcite we fully include the rotation of the comet .",
    "in addition , the integration includes the gas - dust interaction , which has been neglected by @xcite . a stationary gas model around 67/c - g",
    "is constructed by assuming homogeneous outgassing activity across the whole cometary surface , @xcite , and thermal gas velocity ( @xcite , eq .",
    "3.33 ) , @xmath5 molecules at @xmath6  k ( @xcite ) this yields @xmath7  m / s . the co@xmath8 release by 67p / c - g has been detected by the rosina instrument on rosetta at a heliocentric distance of 3.3 au , @xcite . besides the velocity , the second parameter entering the haser model is the surface number - density of the gas @xmath9 .",
    "we neglect different outgassing rates that might originate from different illumination conditions on each surface element .",
    "the transport mechanism described below relies on a slightly higher gravitational pull to the nucleus compared to the gas drag encountered by a dust particle around the comet .",
    "the angular velocity vector and period are from @xcite .",
    "gas density and velocity direction across a slice at @xmath10  km through the cometary nucleus ( @xmath11  m@xmath12 ) .",
    "the highest gas density is reached in the concave neck region due to gas contributing from both side of the valley .",
    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the resulting gas number density distribution and velocity vectors are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gasfield ] .",
    "the maximal gas density is reached within the neck area of 67p / c - g due to the contribution of gas from the two sides of the neck valley , leading to an increased upward dust flow .",
    "the gas drag depends on the dust - particle mass @xmath13 and radius @xmath14 , as well as on the momentum of the impinging gas molecules . for the standard value @xmath15 from @xcite",
    "we obtain an overall factor @xmath16 for the gas - dust interaction @xmath17 where @xmath18 denote the particle radius and mass . for re - colliding particles ,",
    "the gas - drag forces pointing away from the comet are eventually compensated by the gravitational pull of the comet .",
    "a re - collision is only possible if dust particles are emitted with a non - zero initial velocity acquired in the porous mantle layer of the comet , where gas - drag effects are amplified due to the compressed volume available for expansion , @xcite .",
    "we study dust transport occurring over an illuminated cometary surface with homogeneous gas emission .",
    "day / night effects of changing gas - density due to diurnal varying gas pressure are not considered .",
    "this limits the model to trajectories lasting less then half a cometary rotation period of about 6  h. for the derived global dust transport map , we consider the complete comet as uniformly illuminated and dust emitting .",
    "hence , each trajectory represents a possible dust transport path over the sunlit part of the surface .",
    "the irregular shape of the comet results in collisions with elevated terrain rotating into the pathway .",
    "in addition , trajectories are affected by the modulations in the gravitational potential .",
    "the cometary surface is represented by a mesh of 39996 equal - sized triangles and each center of a triangle serves as origin for dust particles . for the simulation",
    ", we chose an initial velocity as @xmath19  m / s along the triangle outwards normal to sample particles emitted with less than the escape velocity .",
    "the results are independent of the number of triangles used to represent the comet shape and have been reproduced with the 19806 triangles mesh discussed in @xcite .",
    "the maximum gas particle density near the surface is varied from @xmath20  m@xmath12 to @xmath21  m@xmath12 for particles of density @xmath22  kg / m@xmath23 and radius @xmath19  mm , resulting in an overall gas drag very close to the gravitational force .",
    "this procedure selects particles hovering up to several hours over the surface .",
    "note that only the overall prefactor @xmath24 is of importance for the gas drag , and thus , equivalently different particle sizes and gas densities are covered in the parametric study .",
    "the results shown here for co@xmath8 hold also for a h@xmath8o gas atmosphere at @xmath25  k with the @xmath26 ratio decreased by the factor @xmath27 , see  eq .  ( [ eq : pfgas ] ) .    for a coarse - grained and ensemble - averaged picture , we embed the cometary shape in a volume mesh of cubes with side length @xmath28  m to track particles emitted from several surface triangles . in each cubic subvolume",
    ", we establish the average particle momentum direction and assign a total particle momentum of all traversing particles .",
    "in addition , the number of particles and the velocities ( direction and magnitude ) are recorded .",
    "the gas - drag forces delay the re - collision of the particle and lead to sustained motion above the surface while the comet rotates .",
    "the gas forces are expected to temporally vary depending on the night / day exposure of the surface . to focus on trajectories across always sunlit terrain , we eliminate trajectories lasting longer than 6  h ( half the rotation period of the comet )",
    ". we account for the expected downfall of particles caused by a reduction in up - ward gas drag , for instance by locally varying outgassing rates , self - shadowing , varying topographical features , and the day - night terminator by taking into account all trajectories up to a ceiling of 300  m above the surface for the surface impinging particle flux .     near surface vectors of dust transport around 67p / c - g .",
