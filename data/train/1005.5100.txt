    "recent work suggests that the isorotation contours in the bulk of the solar convection zone ( hereafter scz ) , correspond to the characteristic curves of the vorticity equation in its `` thermal wind '' form ( balbus 2009 , hereafter b09 ; balbus et al .",
    "2009 , hereafter bblw ; balbus & weiss 2010 ) . in its undeveloped form , this equation relates entropy gradients to angular velocity gradients .",
    "the mathematical existence of the characteristics demands , therefore , some sort of functional relationship between the entropy @xmath0 and angular velocity @xmath1 . the theory presented in the above papers",
    "is predicated upon the notion that within constant @xmath1 surfaces , the dominant , long - lived convective cells carry out their task of mixing entropy with great efficiency .",
    "this means that within a constant @xmath1 surface , the excess entropy gradient above and beyond the minimal radial gradient needed to maintain the convective state is , in essence , eliminated .",
    "the remaining `` residual '' entropy is thus uniform in constant @xmath1 surfaces .",
    "more explicitly , the residual entropy @xmath2 is formed by subtracting a function of spherical radius @xmath3 ( something close to the driving background entropy that has been averaged over angles ) , and @xmath4 is set equal to a function of @xmath1 . this is a powerful constraint , providing the necessary mathematical link for interpreting the solar isorotation contours as trajectory characteristics of a quasilinear partial differential equation .",
    "bblw advances several different lines of argument ( heuristic , numeric , and goodness - of - fit ) supportive of this picture .",
    "originally an mhd basis for the @xmath5 connection was put forth ( b09 ) , but the greater simplicity and generality , as well as the broad agreement with many different lines of argument , together suggest primacy for the bblw mechanism .    an attractive feature of the theory presented in bblw is that it provides simple and intuitive answers to not - so - trivial questions .",
    "for example , why ca nt the solar convection zone rotate on cylinders ?",
    "because if it did , then @xmath1 would necessarily depend upon the spherical colatitude angle @xmath6 , therefore the entropy would also depend upon @xmath6 , and this is inconsistent with a vanishing @xmath7 gradient in the thermal wind equation ( twe ; cf .",
    "equation [ 2 ] below ) . why then is @xmath1 dominated by its @xmath6 gradient ?",
    "now we argue the other way : because the residual entropy has its dominant radial gradient removed ( physically by mixing , mathematically by a simple subtraction ) , the relative importance of its @xmath6 gradient has been enhanced . but",
    "residual entropy shares the same isosurfaces as @xmath1 . in numerical simulations ,",
    "the fact that imposed latitudinal entropy gradients enforced at an interior boundary lead also to latitudinal gradients in @xmath1 ( miesch , brun , & toomre 2006 ) becomes tautological : latitudinal @xmath0-gradients lead inevitably to latitudinal @xmath1-gradients because these gradients are always counteraligned .",
    "in its current formulation , bblw theory addresses the differential rotation in the sun away from the tachocline .",
    "this is nothing if not prudent : the dynamics of the solar tachocline is a notoriously controversial and difficult topic ( e.g. hughes , rosner , & weiss 2007 ) . yet , in studying the isorotation contours within the tachocline , one is struck both by the highly localized nature of the distortion , and by the relative simplicity and uniformity of the their appearance .",
    "in contrast to the bulk of the convection zone and the outer boundary layer , there is a sense of inevitability to these curves",
    ". perhaps their gross form might not be sensitive to the complex details of the internal dynamical structure of the tachocline , any more than the gross adiabatic temperature profile of the scz depends upon the details of the convective heat flux .",
    "we might look instead to the exigencies of local forcing and to the strikingly quadrupolar structure of the region .",
    "the resulting mathematical demands of joining the isorotation contours in such a forced region to the overlying convective zone contours treated in bblw may be sufficiently restrictive that the role of turbulence is tightly confined . in its current form ,",
    "bblw theory has too much `` free play : '' it needs to be restrained . in this work",
    ", we will develop this point of view , and pursue its consequences .",
    "we follow the notation convention of bblw .",
    "cylindrical coordinates are denoted by radius @xmath8 , azimuthal angle @xmath9 and vertical coordinate @xmath7 .",
    "the spherical coordinates are @xmath10 , where @xmath3 is the radius from the origin , @xmath6 the colatitude angle , and @xmath9 the azimuthal angle . the angular velocity @xmath1 , pressure @xmath11 and density @xmath12 are understood to be azimuthal averages .",
    "the dimensionless entropy function @xmath13 is defined by : p^- , where @xmath14 is the usual specific heat ratio , or adiabatic index .    in scz applications ,",
    "the twe is the dominant balance of the vorticity equation , after azimuthal averaging , between the large scale rotation and the baroclinic terms .",
    "the latter arises from a mismatch between equipotential ( or isobaric ) and isochoric surfaces .",
    "more specifically , contributions from convective turbulence are ignored ( i.e. , the convective rossby number is small [ miesch & toomre 2009 ] ) as are those from from magnetic fields .",
    "the twe for the convective zone is ( e.g. thompson et al .",
    "2003 , miesch 2005 , b09 ) : [ eq1 ] r^2z = gr , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the gravitational constant and @xmath17 is a solar mass . in bblw theory , there is a functional relationship of the form [ eq1bis ] ",
    "-_r = f(^2 ) where @xmath18 is any function of @xmath3 ( in practice something very close to an angle - averaged @xmath13 ) and @xmath19 is an unspecified function .",
    "replacing @xmath20 by @xmath13 does not alter the twe , and with the aid of equation ( [ eq1bis ] ) , the twe ( [ eq1 ] ) becomes [ eq2 ] ^2r - ( gfr^2   + r ) ^2 = 0 , where @xmath21 . in this study , we wish to retain , at least in a formal sense , the tachocline meridional stress @xmath22 on the right side of the equation : should be formally be retained in our equation . as a practical matter , the rotational pattern is essentially spherical in this region , and the dominant balance is between the inertial terms and the external stress .",
    "( we thank the referee m. miesch for drawing our attention to this point . ) ] [ eq3 ] ^2r - ( gfr^2   + r ) ^2 = t(r , ) .",
    "although @xmath23 is certainly poorly understood in detail , there is presumably _ some _ function of position that makes equation ( [ eq3 ] ) correct .",
    "the point is that the ensuing formal solution is not without content .",
    "the angular velocity @xmath24 satisfies [ sol1 ] d^2dr = t(r , ) on [ tra1 ] ddr = - gf(^2)r^2   - r. in other words , to solve for @xmath25 , we use the contours as defined by the characteristic differential equation of bblw theory ; along these contours @xmath1 changes according to equation ( [ sol1 ] ) .",
    "we shall assume that equation ( [ eq1bis ] ) is valid both in the bulk of the convective zone as well as in the tachocline .",
    "this is by no means obvious .",
    "the low rossby number approximation is likely to hold well in the tachocline and convective rolls should be strongly affected by shear .",
    "but since the turbulent stresses in the tachocline are very different from those in the convective zone , even if such a functional relationship holds , the function @xmath19 may in principle be quite different in the two regions .",
    "on the other hand _ everything _ changes in the two regions , not the least of which is the sudden appearance of the stresses themselves . for the class of solutions we consider here ( which reproduce the data strikingly well )",
    ", a change in @xmath26 can not be disentangled from a change in @xmath23 , a point we will explicitly discuss (  2.6 ) .",
    "hence , we retain the functional equation ( [ eq1bis ] ) throughout the convective zone and the tachocline .",
    "note that , in contrast to the vanishing @xmath23 limit , when @xmath23 is finite @xmath27 is generally _ not _ constant along the characteristic .",
    "but this does not mean that there is nothing to be learned from considering the constant @xmath1 as a special case for the current , more general , problem .",
    "indeed , in our first approach we should keep formalism to a minimum .",
    "it has been earlier noted ( b09 ) that choosing @xmath28 to be a global constant captures important semi - quantitative features of the true scz isorotation contours , so let us begin first with this mathematically simple case . we will then be poised to look at a more complex problem .",
    "in the limit of constant @xmath26 , the formal trajectory characteristics are identical to those in bblw theory , both outside and within the tachocline : [ tra2 ] ^2= r_0 ^ 2r^2 ^2_0 + 2fgm_r^2 ( 1r - 1r_0 ) , where @xmath30 is the radius at which @xmath1 is initially specified ( generally near or at the surface ) , and @xmath31 marks the beginning value of @xmath6 for a particular characteristic path .",
    "the sign of @xmath23 is now clear : since along a bblw characteristic , @xmath1 increases with decreasing @xmath3 , @xmath23 must be negative at high latitudes and positive at equatorial latitudes .",
    "along such a characteristic , denoted @xmath32 , @xmath24 is given by [ sol2 ] ^2 = _ 0 ^ 2 + _",
    "r_0^r t dr where @xmath33 is the value of @xmath1 at the defining surface .",
    "( note that @xmath30 , which is generally taken at or near the surface , may be larger than @xmath3 . )",
    "the formal solution ( [ sol2 ] ) is in fact general for any @xmath26 , provided that @xmath32 is taken to be the proper trajectory characteristic .",
    "it is not difficult to extract the qualitative behavior of @xmath1 from equations ( [ tra2 ] ) and ( [ sol2 ] ) .",
    "the stress @xmath23 is very small except in a very narrow region near the transition radius @xmath34 .",
    "thus @xmath24 remains essentially fixed at its initial value @xmath35 along most of the extent of the characteristic .",
    "this , of course , is bblw theory .",
    "then , there is a sudden increase in @xmath23 very near @xmath34 , and along the bblw characteristic @xmath32 , @xmath1 now makes a very sharp rise ( or a sharp drop near the equator ) as it settles to the uniform rotation rate in the radiative interior .",
    "the resulting isorotational curves can be understood with the aid of figure ( 1 ) .",
    "this diagram is a local representation of the scz - tachocline boundary in a region where the angular velocity begins to increase sharply moving inward .",
    "the radius @xmath3 increases upward to the right ; @xmath6 increases downward to the right .",
    "the numbers @xmath36 though @xmath37 label bblw characteristics , which in the convection zone are precisely the isorotation contours .",
    "hence these numbers may also be thought of as angular velocities , increasing with the magnitude of the number .",
    "consider the rightmost contour labeled @xmath37",
    ". between @xmath37 and the dot labeled 4 on the same curve , the contour passes through the convective zone , and the angular velocity remains constant .",
    "dot 4 marks the beginning of the tachocline , and a steep rise in the angular velocity . to continue the trace of the isorotation contour , a sharp turn to the ( reader s ) left",
    "is required , and the curve continues by passing through dot 4 on the curves labeled @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath36 , etc .",
    "thus , within the narrow radial band of changing @xmath1 , if one were to follow curves of constant @xmath1 , from one bblw trajectory characteristic to those immediately adjacent , a quasi - spherical ( @xmath3 increases somewhat with @xmath6 ) path would emerge .",
    "this abrupt change in the isorotation contours is clearly seen in the helioseismology data .",
    "the more delicate @xmath6 dependence of @xmath3 is also present in the data , though this may be an artifact of the inversion technique .",
    "the above description motivates a green s function approach .",
    "consider a tachocline stress of the form t(r , ) = - ( ^2)f()(r - r_t ) where @xmath40 is the `` jump amplitude , '' @xmath41 is a function of @xmath6 that modulates the magnitude of the radial inward jump ( @xmath42 is positive at high latitudes , negative at small latitudes ) , and @xmath43 is the dirac delta function .",
    "then along a bblw characteristic , [ omg ] ^2 = _ 0 ^ 2 + ( r_t - r ) ( ^2)f((r_t ) ) where @xmath32 may be determined explicitly from equation ( [ tra2 ] ) , and @xmath44 is the heaviside function .",
    "( recall that @xmath45 is unity when its argument is positive and zero when its argument is negative . ) in this rather drastic idealization , bblw theory breaks down at a single radius @xmath34 , which we identify with the tachocline .",
    "the bblw isorotation contours change abruptly to a single spherical shell in this model , compressing the entire tachocline down to a range of vanishing thickness .",
    "it is possible , of course , to continue along the lines of the previous section by introducing progressively more sophisticated models for @xmath22 and @xmath27 , and in fact we shall shortly consider the case in which @xmath26 is a linear function of @xmath24 .",
    "it is already clear , however , that within this scheme , the helioseismology data can be reproduced  at least qualitatively .",
    "if our approach is not quite tight enough to be broadly predictive , it might be more profitably applied in the reverse sense : use the solar rotation data directly to infer the form of @xmath22 .",
    "a very important result emerges immediately . in figure",
    "( 2 ) , on the left we see the isorotation contours taken from gong data , together with the bblw characteristics overlaid for reference . as one",
    "passes through the tachocline from larger to smaller radii , the inward jump in @xmath24 changes from positive to negative for @xmath6 larger than @xmath46 , the value of @xmath6 for which @xmath47 . the inset to the right in figure ( 2 ) , displaying gong data together with the location of the critical angle , shows this very clearly .",
    "the magnitude of the jump then grows ( in the negative sense ) as @xmath6 increases , as we move toward the equator .",
    "the spacing of the isorotational contours is , at least crudely , about half the interval at the poles as compared with the equator . even granting the inevitable uncertainties associated with the polar data ( which are not reliable poleward of @xmath48 degrees ) ,",
    "these results are much what one would expect if @xmath41 , the angular component in our radially local model , were proportional to @xmath49 the legendre polynomial of order 2 . to leading order , _",
    "the tachocline stresses are revealing a dominant quadrupolar structure .",
    "_    this is such a fundamental property of tachocline structure , it is curious that the near coincidence of the zero of @xmath50 and the `` zero '' of the tachocline has not been emphasized in the earlier literature . while meridional flows and their associated stresses have been an important feature of dynamical models of the tachocline ( e.g. spiegel & zahn 1992 , gough & mcintyre 1998 ) , and such flows are generally associated with @xmath50 stresses ( schwarzschild 1958 ) , what is striking here is the manifest quadrupolar morphology . in  2.6 below we use explicit quadrupolar forcing to leverage a mathematically precise isorotational contour solution from our fundamental equation , with essentially no other input .",
    "so it is of some interest to try to understand its origin .",
    "the most important omission from the thermal wind equation , the basis of our analysis , is the contribution from turbulent stresses and meridional flow .",
    "these may be kinetic or magnetic , but they will generally take the form of a sum of terms proportional to @xmath51 where the index @xmath52 is itself summed over , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 represent symbolic vector quantities ( velocity fluctuations , vorticity , current density , etc . ) .",
    "it is the @xmath3 and @xmath6 components of @xmath52 that are important ( the @xmath9 components vanish either explicitly or upon azimuthal averaging ) ; hence the earlier designation of the resulting stress as `` meridional . ''",
    "the net contribution of these correlated products evidently behaves as a large scale quadrupolar forcing .",
    "given the symmetry of our flow , it is not surprising that the leading order departure from spherical structure   is quadrupolar , but it is rather surprising how well this approximation works .",
    "we now combine the results of the previous section to obtain an explicit mathematical solution for @xmath1 .",
    "equation ( [ tra2 ] ) implies quite generally that [ tra3 ] ^2_0 = r^2r_0 ^ 2 ^2- 2fgm_r_0 ^ 2 ( 1r - 1r_0 ) . now at @xmath56 equation ( [ tra2 ] ) gives , [ tra4 ] ^2(r_t ) = r_0 ^ 2r_t^2 ^2_0 + 2fgm_r_t^2 ( 1r_t - 1r_0 ) .",
    "then , substituting equation ( [ tra3 ] ) in ( [ tra4 ] ) leads to ^2(r_t ) = r^2r_t^2 ^2 + 2fgm_r_t^2 ( 1r_t - 1r ) , or [ tra6 ] ^2(r_t ) = ( 1 - r^2r_t^2 ) ^2 + 2fgm_r_t^2 ( 1r - 1r_t ) , then , equation ( [ omg ] ) becomes [ frml ] ^2(r , ) = _ 0 ^ 2(^2_0 ) + ( r_t - r)(^2 ) p_2[(r_t ) ] where @xmath57 is given by equation ( [ tra3 ] ) , @xmath58 by equation ( [ tra6 ] ) , and we have assumed that @xmath42 is the legendre polynomial of order 2",
    ".    equation ( [ frml ] ) is the desired explicit solution for @xmath24 , but there is another way to formulate the content of our simple problem : given @xmath40 , what kind of a spread of surface velocities is associated with this jump ?",
    "the answer is _ 0 ^ 2(^2_0 ) = _ rad^2 - ( ^2 ) p_2[(r_t ) ] = ^2 - ( ^2 ) + 32 ( ^2)^2[(r_t ) ] where @xmath59 is the angular velocity of the uniformly rotating radiative interior . with the aid of equation ( [ tra4 ] )",
    ", we may rewrite this in terms of @xmath57 .",
    "choosing @xmath60 , and denoting the final term of equation ( [ tra4 ] ) as @xmath61 ( a number of order , but typically less than , unity ) , we find [ sun1 ] _ 0 ^ 2(^2_0 ) = _ rad^2 -(1 + ) ( ^2 ) + 3 ( ^2)^2(_0 ) this calculation is a bit too simple to generate more complexity than a @xmath57 departure from uniform surface rotation .",
    "nevertheless , for reasonable values of @xmath40 , equation ( [ sun1 ] ) gives a very respectable rendering of a solar - like surface rotation profile .",
    "more importantly , it establishes a dynamical coupling between the spread in @xmath24 present near the surface and the jump in @xmath24 at the location of tachocline .",
    "the connection between these two regions is possible because of the existence of linking trajectory characteristics .",
    "equation ( [ sun1 ] ) should not be construed as a statement that the spread in surface angular velocities is actually _ caused _ by forcing from the tachocline ; indeed , the sense of causality is generally thought to run in the opposite sense : from the scz to the tachocline ( e.g. gough 2010 ) . instead ,",
    "equation ( [ sun1 ] ) shows explicitly how the dynamics of thermal wind balance plus external driving leads to a relatively simply coupling between the radial jump in @xmath24 at the tachocline and the angular spread in @xmath24 at the surface .",
    "we next consider the case in which @xmath26 varies linearly with @xmath24 .",
    "this is useful both in establishing that there is no particular sensitivity to the assumption of a constant @xmath26 , and in allowing more detailed structure to be revealed .",
    "in fact , the essential qualitative effects of a nonconstant @xmath26 will be evident once the governing equation is at hand .",
    "we begin by rewriting the trajectory characteristic equation ( [ tra1 ] ) in the compact form [ ff2 ] dr^2dr = - 2 g f(^2 ) , where , as before , @xmath62 , the axial radius .",
    "let [ f1 ] f(^2 ) = - -^2 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are constants . dividing by @xmath65 , differentiating with respect to @xmath3 , and using equations",
    "( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ sol1 ] ) leads to = 2 t(r , ) recalling that @xmath66 , this leads to the final form of our equation for the trajectory characteristics , now free of all explicit @xmath1 dependence : [ r21 ] d^2dr^2(rr^2 ) = 2gm _ r t(r , ) .",
    "we now make the very reasonable and important assumption that _",
    "@xmath67 is local in @xmath3 , _ so that this variable is always near the shell @xmath56 whenever @xmath23 is finite . in essence , we ignore curvature terms , something we must do self - consistently since these global terms are not known for general @xmath22 .",
    "the local model avoids this difficulty while retaining the essential physics , because the tachocline transition is not , in reality , very broad .",
    "consider equation ( [ r21 ] ) when the driving term @xmath22 takes the ( radially local ) form t(r , ) = - t_0 p_2 ( ) where @xmath68 is a constant term .",
    "we assume that @xmath23 is present only for @xmath69 . in this region , the differential equation ( [ r21 ] )",
    "becomes [ ode3 ] d^2(r^3 ^ 2)dr^2 = 2gm _ t_0r ( 32 ^2 - 1 ) it should be noted that the function @xmath26 makes its appearance here only through the @xmath64 parameter , and then only via the combination @xmath70 .",
    "this illustrates the point first made in the introduction : a different value of @xmath64 can equivalently be regarded as keeping @xmath64 the same and changing @xmath68 .",
    "there is nothing to be gained by allowing a change in @xmath26 in the tachocline , at least not for the class of model of interest here .    replacing @xmath3 by @xmath34",

    "indeed , to keep the mathematics as simple as possible , we have not even used the best fit for the exterior solution shown in figure ( 2 ) , but rather something much more basic .",
    "still , the similarity of our closed form solution to the gong data is unmistakable .",
    "our results can be compactly summarized : the analysis shows that the scz is essentially in thermal wind balance from near the surface down to a transition radius of @xmath87 , at which point distinctly quadrupolar tacholine meridional stresses bring the rotation profile to that of a solid body .",
    "for all of its detailed complexity , the role of turbulent angular momentum transport in the scz is strictly constrained , much as thermal transport has little choice but to establish a nearly adiabatic temperature profile .",
    "the level of dynamical detail that can now be elucidated in numerical simulations of the scz is truly impressive ( e.g. miesch et al . 2008 ) , but simulations incorporating the tachocline into global models of solar differential rotation are only just beginning to take form ( browning et al .",
    "2006 , miesch et al .",
    "the solar tachocline remains a complex , poorly understood region of turbulent activity .",
    "while the details of the interaction between the tachocline and the large scale differential rotation of the scz are not yet within reach , certain gross features of this interaction may in fact be tractable . in this work ,",
    "we have made an inroad by assuming that entropy is well - mixed in surfaces of constant angular velocity within the convectively unstable portion of the tachocline , just as it appears to be within the scz .",
    "since the convective rossby number is likely to be even smaller here than in the scz , this would seem to be a reasonable approximation .",
    "the explicit separation of the more general tachocline stresses from the mean inertial and baroclinic terms in the governing equation of vorticity conservation in its developed thermal wind form , and their reduction to a single formal inhomogeneous forcing term , has proven to be mathematically advantageous",
    ". the precise nature of this stress is , of course , of an unknown character .",
    "we would argue , however , that its consequences are not _ unknowable .",
    "_ the stress operates locally in radius and exhibits a definite quadrupolar angular structure : this is a very important point we wish to emphasize .",
    "it can be put to good use , because the formalism of quasilinear partial differential equations may be brought to bear on the problem . in particular",
    ", one may analyze the problem in terms of trajectory characteristics , whose form depends only implicitly on the tachocline stress terms , and solution characteristics , along which @xmath1 changes explicitly due to these same terms .    in bblw theory , the solution characteristics convey constant @xmath1 along the trajectory characteristics .",
    "these characteristics are then identical to the isorotation contours .",
    "it is thus of considerable interest that in a simple and revealing class of solutions , the trajectory characteristics are mathematically identical to those of bblw theory , even within the tachocline .",
    "the solution characteristics are certainly altered , however : they dictate that @xmath1 is initially constant along the trajectories , but then changes rapidly along these same curves as the tachocline is penetrated from above .",
    "the result is quasi - spherical isorotation contours inside of the tachocline , followed by a sharp upturn when the convection zone is reached from below .",
    "this behavior is also clearly seen in a more sophisticated , but still explicit , solution that is presented in this paper ( cf .",
    "figure [ 4 ] ) .",
    "the radially local nature of the tachocline stresses is the crux of the problem , as it allows for mathematical modeling independent of the need of detailed knowledge of the spatial structure of the forcing .",
    "the simplest approach is to use green function techniques with forcing by a dirac @xmath90-function at a transition radius @xmath34 .",
    "the dominant @xmath50 angular structure of the tachocline stresses becomes very apparent when the radial behavior is simplified in this way .",
    "since the monopole response is evidently small , a reasonable surmise is that the turbulent stresses in the tachocline are driven by off - diagonal terms in a correlation tensor .",
    "angular momentum stresses within the scz create differential rotation , even if the initial condition is one of uniform rotation .",
    "thus , in a causal sense , the tachocline likely owes its existence to the stresses of the convective zone , and not vice - versa . in its current state of development",
    ", our calculation can not directly address this causal link , but it does suggest how a dynamical couple arises between the surface spread in angular velocity and the tachocline angular velocity jump . this characteristic - based connection between the jump in the angular velocity at the tachocline and the spread of angular velocities at the solar surface is an important consequence of simple quadrupolar forcing .",
    "venturing even a little beyond a simple green s function approach gives a much richer return .",
    "if one allows both an @xmath1-dependence in our @xmath26 function and a finite thickness for the transition region , the mathematical structure of the problem becomes more complicated : the solution and trajectory characteristics are now coupled .",
    "but it is still possible to obtain an explicit closed form solution for the isorotation contours .",
    "this , the principal result of this paper , is shown in figure ( 4 ) .",
    "the relatively simple solution so much resembles the gong contours seen in figure ( 2 ) , there can be little doubt that at the very least , the mathematical content of our approach is sound .",
    "even if viewed at a purely phenomenological level , this is surely progress .",
    "while our results provide a simple framework to aid in the elucidation of the global character of solar differential rotation , many questions remain unanswered . quite apart from the grand challenge problem of tachocline structure and dynamics",
    ", it is legitimate to question the work presented here on its own terms .",
    "how general and robust , for example , is the separation embodied in equation ( 5 ) , or the critical assumption that a functional relation remains between residual entropy and angular momentum in the lower buoyancy tachocline ?",
    "why should such a simple approach work so well ?",
    "there is also evidence that the tachocline thickness varies with @xmath6 ( christensen - dalsgaard & thompson 2007 ) , an effect completely neglected here .",
    "the relative simplicity of our arguments is somewhat deceptive , because it masks the deeper conceptual problem of understanding precisely _ how _ the coupling between the tachocline and the convective zone rotation profile is established ( see , e.g. rempel 2005 , gough 2010 ) .",
    "these issues certainly have not been addressed by this work ; doing so without recourse to turbulence modeling will remain the province of numerical simulation for the foreseeable future .",
    "but in this weakness also lies some power .",
    "we have noted earlier that the scz adiabatic temperature profile sheds little light on the dynamics of convective transport , though it is in an important sense completely beholden to it .",
    "this is not usually viewed as a shortcoming ; rather it is a useful and powerful constraint .",
    "this is a point worth remembering : some aspects of the solar rotation problem are bound to be less mysterious than others .",
    "if thermal wind balance and the confluence of isorotation and constant residual entropy surfaces lead to important constraints for the sun s rotation profile , the theorist s task will be greatly simplified  and understanding how the sun rotates may prove to be a less daunting challenge than it might have first appeared .",
    "this work benefited from an exceptionally thorough and constructive review by our referee mark miesch , and we are most grateful to him for many valuable comments .",
    "we are likewise indebted to nigel weiss for important advice in the early stages of this work .",
    "finally , we thank rachel howe for making reduced gong data available to us in electronic form . this work has been supported by a grant from the conseil rgional de lile de france .",
