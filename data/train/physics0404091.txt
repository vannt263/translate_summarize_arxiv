    "the situation changes slightly when we consider the positivity constraint .",
    "the previous definitions of the algorithms still apply just replacing @xmath26 with @xmath27 : @xmath28 the only difference is hio which becomes : @xmath29 fig .",
    "[ 2circlesposa ] shows that hio bouches at the @xmath30 axis .",
    "as the positivity constraint gets closer to the solution , none of the algorithms converges to the solution ( fig . [ 2circlesposb ] ) , with the hio - type algorithms bouncing between the regions closer to the two circles . only difference map for @xmath31 converges ( fig . [ 2circlesposc ] ) .",
    "also hio+er would reach the solution for larger intervals between er iterations .",
    "er is a simple but powerfull local minimizer , hio and variants are very powerfull in escaping local minima , but in several situations fail to converge .",
    "when positivity is introduced , the recursive version of hio ( hpr ) converges more ` smoothly ' to the solution without bounching on the @xmath30 axis .",
    "alternating between hio and er with the correct intervals would have worked in all the examples shown above .",
    "raas is a good ( single parameter ) way to change from ` global ' to local minimizer , although it seems better to start from a high value of @xmath23 and decrease it afterwards .",
    "difference map is succesfull in a few more of the examples shown above for the proper choiche of @xmath23 , however it involves 2 time consuming modulus constraint operations . to find when stagnation occours",
    "one can monitor the distances ( using the proper error metrics ) of the current solution before and after aplying various projectors , or monitor the autocorrelation between two succesive reconstructions .",
    "speden , a conjugate gradient based method , reaches a local minimum with quadradic convergence , and provides such kind of information .",
    "the solvent flipping algorithm does not show much success in the examples shown above . despite this",
    "it was used to improve images @xcite , and in a modified form to solve 3d structures ab - initio @xcite .",
    "perhaps the reason for the latter success has more to do with the _ threshold _",
    "constraint used .",
    "a _ threshold projector _ multiplies by 0 everything that is below a given threshold , while a _ threshold reflector _ multiplies it by -1 .",
    "the application of this constraint has been proven succesfull in obtaining _ ab - initio _ solution in many circumstances applied in a variety of ways .",
    "apart from charge flipping , which uses a threshold reflector @xcite , in electron density modification procedure with sir @xcite , in atomicity constraint @xcite , a modified histogram constraint using the difference map ( h. he , private comm . ) , and for complex valued objects , in the shrink - wrap algorithm using an updated support constraint by thresholding the current object reconstruction at low resolution @xcite .    by compressing the image in small spots and by increasing the flat region , these algorithms based on the threshold constraint",
    "resemble the maximum entropy method @xcite , which tries to reduce the amout of information in an image and maximize the number of pixels of equal value ( solvent ) .",
    "what distinguishes shrink - wrap and sir algorithms is that they somehow solve the low resolution first , and gradually introduce high resolution information while slowly updating the low resolution information .",
    "fienup has also shown that starting from a low resolution image , slowly increasing resolution improves the algorithm @xcite .",
    "also speden starting from a low resolution target has been shown to slowly extend the correct phase information to higher resolution .",
    "one possible explanation could be that the set based on low resolution is ` more smooth ' .",
    "perhaps also slowly increasing the gray levels in an image , or the number of possible phases of its fourier transform could improve convergence by gradually introducing more degrees of freedom in the resulting image , although a set defined by ` quantized ' levels is also non - convex rendering it counterproductive .",

    "<S> the advantage of this example is the simplicity in the ` modulus ' projector operator ( it projects onto the closest circle ) . </S>",

    "<S> we start from a position near the local minimum . </S>",
    "<S> er , solvent flip and hio+er all fall into this trap ( fig . </S>",
