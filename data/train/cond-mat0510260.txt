    "in two - dimensional electron systems ( 2des ) with high ( @xmath0 ) mobility , the magnetoresistance exhibits strong oscillations in pre - shubnikov interval of magnetic fields under microwave irradiation @xcite .",
    "the parameter that governs those oscillations is the ratio of the radiation frequency @xmath1 to the cyclotron frequency @xmath2 .",
    "the maxima of the magnetoresistance are observed at @xmath3 , where @xmath4 takes integer values .",
    "the resistance of the sample is minimal at @xmath5 , and with sufficiently intensive radiation zero - resistance states are observed .",
    "let s mention the important features of the above - mentioned experiments .",
    "the effect is observed under the conditions : @xmath6 , from which one can conclude that its nature is quasiclassical . here",
    "@xmath7 is the momentum relaxation time , @xmath8 are the radiation frequency and the cyclotron frequency , respectively , @xmath9 is the fermi energy , @xmath10 is the temperature expressed in units of energy .    currently , there exist a sufficiently large number of theoretical papers ( @xcite , see also @xcite and references therein ) in which various aspects of the observed phenomena are considered .",
    "it is necessary to note that the possibility of the existence of negative - resistance states was first predicted in @xcite .",
    "some of the models are based upon the influence of the microwave radiation upon the processes of scattering an electron along the weak dc electric field or in the opposite direction .",
    "there are also alternative explanations that relate the observed phenomena with non - trivial dependence of the non - equilibrium distribution function upon the energy , that acquires oscillating character under the effect of the microwave radiation .",
    "the schemes described above presume that only bulk effects are responsible for the observed phenomena .",
    "other models are possible .",
    "e.g. , the scenario proposed in @xcite says that two mechanisms are actually important .",
    "one of them leads to a resonance at the magnetoplasmon frequency and is of the bulk origin .",
    "the second one is related to the development of drift plasma instability at the edge of the sample .",
    "both the proposed models and the predictions that follow from them still require additional experimental validation .    in this paper , in order to explain the observed conductivity oscillations , we present a model that incorporates contributions from landau quantization and microwave irradiation ( in long - wavelength limit ) exactly , without the use of perturbation theory .",
    "electron scattering upon impurities is considered perturbatively . with respect to landau ",
    "floquet states , impurities act as a coherent oscillating field that causes transitions which are essential for reproducing the oscillating magnetoresistance behavior .",
    "this problem is a classical variant of the theory of non - equilibrium system response to a weak measuring field .",
    "indeed , under microwave irradiation , in the system under consideration a non - equilibrium state is formed .",
    "the task is to find the response of such possibly strongly non - equilibrium system to a weak measuring field .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the theory of linear reaction upon external mechanical perturbations is currently well - established . within this approach ,",
    "the kinetic coefficients are expressed in terms of the equilibrium correlation functions . however , the situation changes radically if it is required to find the response of a system that is already out of the equilibrium , to an additional measurement field .",
    "problems of this kind are usually solved with the help of the method of kinetic equations .",
    "we shall apply the theory of linear response of a non - equilibrium system to a weak measurement field for analysis of the transport phenomena for 2d charge carriers under microwave irradiation .",
    "our results depict strong oscillations of @xmath11 with negative resistance states .",
    "it has been found that that the microwave - induced correction to @xmath11 vanishes when @xmath12 , @xmath4 is an integer .",
    "oscillations have minima at @xmath13 and maxima at @xmath14 , where @xmath15 .",
    "the calculations have been carried out for various polarizations of microwave electric field .",
    "the role of the mobility of the carriers for the magnetoresistance oscillations has been studied .",
    "it has been shown that magnetoresistance oscillations should still be observable in the lower - mobility samples if one increases the microwave radiation frequency . a role of multiphoton process in this phenomenon",
    "can also be relatively easily studied using the described approach .",
    "the article is organized in the following way . in section [ cantrans ] , the canonical transformation of the hamiltonian",
    "is considered .",
    "this allows us to avoid the direct analysis of the system s reaction upon the ac electric field of the microwave radiation that is not necessarily a weak perturbation .",
    "section [ linresp ] contains a short introduction into the theory of the linear response of a non - equilibrium system .",
    "this theory is applied to the canonically - transformed system . in the same section ,",
    "the main results for the magnetoconductivity tensor are expressed .",
    "finally , the results of the numerical analysis are presented in section [ numanal ] , followed by the conclusion .",
