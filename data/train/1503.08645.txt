    "the current contribution is aimed at reporting on the results , recently presented in refs.@xcite , concerning the computation of the pion s valence dressed - quark gpd , based upon a rainbow - ladder ( rl ) truncation of qcd s dyson - schwinger equations ( dse ) , and its connection to the parton distribution function ( pdf ) in the appropriate forward limit .    after more than forty years of studying pdfs , since quarks were discovered in a series of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments at the stanford linear accelerator center @xcite , a good deal is known about hadron light - front structure . notwithstanding that ,",
    "much more needs to be understood , particularly , e.g. , in connection with the distribution of helicity @xcite .",
    "moreover , pdfs only describe hadron light - front structure incompletely because inclusive dis measurements do not yield information about the distribution of partons in the plane perpendicular to the bound - state s total momentum ; i.e. , within the light front .",
    "such information is expressed in generalised parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite , which are accessible via deeply virtual compton scattering on a target hadron , @xmath4 ; viz . ,",
    "@xmath5 , so long as at least one of the photons [ @xmath6 , @xmath7 possesses large virtuality , and in the analogous process of deeply virtual meson production : @xmath8 .",
    "importantly [ see sect .",
    "2 ] , gpds connect pdfs with hadron form factors because any pdf may be recovered as a forward limit of the relevant gpd and any hadron elastic form factors can be expressed via a gpd - based sum rule .",
    "the potential that gpds hold for providing manifold insights into hadron structure has led to intense experimental and theoretical activity @xcite .",
    "most of the constraints that apply to gpds are fulfilled when the gpd is written as a double distribution @xcite , which is equivalent to expressing the gpd as a radon transform @xcite : @xmath9\\,,\\ ] ] where the variables @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are defined following eq .   and , at leading - twist , @xmath13 , @xmath14 have operator definitions analogous to the gpd itself . in order to obtain insights into the nature of hadron gpds ,",
    "it has been common to model the radon amplitudes , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , following refs.@xcite .",
    "this approach has achieved some phenomenological success @xcite ; but more flexible parametrisations enable a better fit to data @xcite . such fits played a valuable role in establishing the gpd framework ; but if one wishes to use measured gpds as a means by which to validate our basic perception of strong interactions in the standard model , then data fitting is inadequate . instead",
    ", it is necessary to compute gpds using a framework that possesses a direct connection with qcd .",
    "this observation is highlighted by experience drawn from the simpler case of the pion s valence - quark pdf @xcite .",
    "herein , we therefore adopt a different approach , sketching a procedure for the computation of hadron gpds based on the example provided by the pion s valence - quark pdf .",
    "from a quark model perspective , in the isospin symmetric limit , the pion is a quantum mechanical bound - state of two equal - mass constituents and it is therefore the simplest hadronic bound - state .",
    "that is a misapprehension , however .",
    "owing to the connection between pion properties and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) ; i.e. , its dichotomous nature as a goldstone mode and relativistic bound - state @xcite , a veracious description of the pion is only possible within a framework that faithfully expresses symmetries and their breaking patterns .",
    "the dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) fulfill this requirement @xcite and hence we employ that framework to compute pion properties herein .    notwithstanding",
    "the complex nature of the pion bound - state , it is still a @xmath15 system and hence for a vector probe there is only one gpd associated with a quark @xmath16 in the pion ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) .",
    "it is defined by the matrix element @xmath19 where : @xmath20 , @xmath21 are light - like four - vectors , satisfying @xmath22 , @xmath23 ; @xmath24 represents that two - component part of @xmath25 annihilated by both @xmath20 , @xmath21 ; and @xmath26 . in eq .",
    ", @xmath27 $ ] is the `` skewness '' , @xmath28 is the momentum transfer , and @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "the gpd also depends on the resolving scale , @xmath31 . within the domain upon which",
    "perturbation theory is valid , evolution to another scale @xmath32 is described by the erbl equations @xcite for @xmath33 and the dglap equations @xcite for @xmath34 , where @xmath35 .    in order to produce quantities that are gauge invariant for all values of @xmath25 , eq .",
    "should contain a wilson line , @xmath36 $ ] , between the quark fields .",
    "notably , for any light - front trajectory , @xmath36\\equiv 1 $ ] in lightcone gauge : @xmath37 , and hence the wilson line does not contribute in this case . on the other hand ,",
    "light - cone gauge is seldom practicable in either model calculations or quantitative nonperturbative analyses in continuum qcd .",
    "indeed , herein , as typical of nonperturbative dse studies , we employ landau gauge because , _ inter alia _",
    "@xcite : it is a fixed point of the renormalisation group ; and a covariant gauge , which is readily implemented in numerical simulations of lattice - qcd .",
    "it is therefore significant that @xmath36 $ ] is not quantitatively important in the calculation of the leading - twist contributions to numerous matrix elements @xcite .",
    "it is worth recapitulating here upon some general properties of gpds .",

    "it is not a property of the pion s complete gpd , @xmath193 , because the valence gpd is a negligible piece of the full gpd on @xmath194 .",
    "that may be seen , e.g. , by noting that valence - quarks carry none of the pion s momentum within the conformal domain and hence it is invalid therein to represent @xmath195 by an impulse ( rainbow - ladder ) approximation expressed through the triangle diagram of eq .. having determined @xmath167 , it is straightforward to obtain @xmath196 from eq .. the result is depicted in the lower panel of fig.[figqbx2 ] : apparently , the maximum is shifted toward @xmath183 and compressed in that direction , the peak height is diminished , and the width of the distribution in @xmath80 is increased .",
    "each one of these evolution - induced changes may be intuitively understood by reasoning as follows .",
    "first consider a limiting case of an active parton with @xmath197 .",
    "this parton carries ( almost ) all the longitudinal momentum of the hadron .",
    "it therefore _ defines _ the cotm and hence can not be far removed from that centre .",
    "the distribution associated with an @xmath197 parton must therefore be tightly localised around @xmath74 . on the other hand , consider the case of an active parton with @xmath10 reduced toward the location of the global maximum .",
    "the remaining partons within the hadron share in defining the cotm and hence the active parton is not constrained to lie at @xmath74 .",
    "plainly , as a parton s value of @xmath10 diminishes toward the favoured value , it plays less of a role in determining the cotm and may therefore possess even larger values of @xmath80 .    in the current context , recall that evolution exposes the glue and sea - quark content of a dressed - quark :",
    "its identity comes to be shared amongst a host of partons , so that the probability of any one parton carrying @xmath197 is much diminished .",
    "it follows that the global maximum in @xmath198 must move toward @xmath183 with increasing @xmath31 and , simultaneously , that the distribution is broadened in @xmath80 on the remaining domain of material support .",
    "distribution of pion s mean - square transverse extent , eq . : ( black ) solid curve @xmath199 ; and ( blue ) dashed curve  @xmath200 .",
    "the ( green ) dotted curve is the result obtained at @xmath201 when the correlation function @xmath202 in eq .",
    "is neglected : comparison with the dashed curve shows that the product _ ansatz _ @xmath203 is generally unreliable . ]    the latter effect is illustrated in fig.[b2x ] , which depicts @xmath204 i.e. , the @xmath10-distribution of the pion s mean - square transverse extent : under evolution , the transverse extent narrows at large-@xmath10 and broadens at small-@xmath10 .",
    "a little consideration reveals that the measure of the curves in fig.[b2x ] is independent of the scale @xmath31 because evolution is an operation that preserves the area under @xmath205 at each @xmath12 .",
    "in fact , using eqs .",
    ", , , one finds    @xmath206    and hence , with @xmath195 in eq . , @xmath207 .",
    "for the reasons just explained , this is also the value obtained with eq .. [ note that @xmath208 , where @xmath209 is the pion s electric charge radius , yields @xmath210 ( empirically @xcite @xmath211fm ) . ] it is natural that the mean - squared transverse extent of the dressed - quarks within a pion should be commensurate with the length - scale associated with light - quark confinement realised through a violation of reflection positivity [ see , e.g. , sect.2.2 in ref.@xcite ] .",
    "we described a calculation of the pion s valence dressed - quark generalised parton distribution ( gpd ) , @xmath0 , within the context of a rainbow - ladder ( rl ) truncation of qcd s dyson - schwinger equations .",
    "this framework is useful at an hadronic scale because it provides a description of hadrons via a dressed - quark basis , the accuracy of which in any given channel is knowable _ a priori_. our analysis focused here on the case of zero skewness ( @xmath1 ) but we have also shown in ref.@xcite that the symmetry - preserving character of the rl truncation is all one needs to demonstrate a known relationship between @xmath212 and the pion s valence - quark parton distribution amplitude .    drawing analogy with the pion s valence dressed - quark distribution function , we argued that the impulse - approximation used hitherto to define the pion s valence gpd is generally invalid owing to omission of contributions from the gluons which bind dressed - quarks into the pion .",
    "we used a simple correction [ eq . ] , valid in the neighbourhood of @xmath1 , @xmath48 , in order to identify a practicable improvement to the approximation for @xmath2 . expressing the result as the radon transform of a single amplitude",
    ", we were able to isolate and remove those terms which produce unphysical behaviour , such as violations of positivity by the @xmath1 gpd .",
    "the resulting , ameliorated radon amplitude yields a form for @xmath2 [ eqs . , ] which is consistent with significantly more known constraints than is the result produced by the impulse approximation alone .",
    "the results obtained in this way for @xmath2 , @xmath3 [ figs.[fighx0tz0z2 ] , [ figqbx2 ] ] provide a qualitatively sound picture of the dressed - quark structure of the pion at an hadronic scale .",
    "using leading - order expressions , we evolved these distributions to a scale @xmath213gev .",
    "all features of the resulting valence quark gpds may be intuitively understood and hence the distributions should serve as an elementary but reasonable guide in the planning and interpretation of relevant experiments at existing or anticipated @xcite facilities , which could plausibly involve deeply - virtual compton scattering on pions in a nucleon s meson cloud .    notwithstanding",
    "the simplicity of the framework employed herein , a merit of the approach is its potential to _ compute _ features of hadron gpds on the valence - quark domain and relate them directly to properties of qcd",
    ". this capacity has already been demonstrated in the simpler case of the pion s valence parton distribution function @xcite .",
    "one may begin to realise that potential by using more realistic forms for the dressed - propagators and -vertices that appear in the rl truncation analysis and , perhaps more importantly , uncovering the amendment to impulse approximation which is required in order to extend the validity of the rl truncation to the entire kinematic domain of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
