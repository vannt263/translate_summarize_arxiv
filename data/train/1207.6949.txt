    "in addition to quantifying the increase in the thrust force observed when using a flexible foil , we demonstrate that flexibility inhibits the symmetry breaking of the propulsive wake .",
    "the experimental set - up closely resembles the one described in @xcite and consists of a pitching foil of span - to - chord aspect ratio of 4:1 placed in a hydrodynamic tunnel ( see figure [ fig_setup ] ) .",

    "for each experimental configuration , we start tracking the vortex closest to the trailing edge at the moment of reversal in the direction of the flapping motion , which corresponds to the birth of the new vortex .",
    "the vortex is characterized in terms of its circulation and streamwise and transverse position in the wake as in @xcite . in figure",
    "[ suivitbs ] , a time series of vorticity fields is shown for each type of foil , rigid and flexible , for the same control parameters : frequency ( @xmath23=0.3 ) and pitching angle ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the two vortices closest to the flap ( counter - rotating , enclosed by squares in fig .  [ suivitbs ] ) are tracked , giving the time series of position shown in fig .",
    "[ positiontbs ]",
    ". we will refer to the vortex closest to the flap ( negative vorticity ) as vortex i and the one shed previously ( positive vorticity ) as vortex ii .",
    "the first point concerns the time evolution of the streamwise position of the vortices : we observed systematically that in the case of the flexible foil , vortices are shed closer to the origin ( the rotation axis of the foil ) in the @xmath18 direction than in the case of the rigid foil ( this can be seen in the the track of vortex i in fig .  [ positiontbs ] ) .",
    "the difference between the two foils is less marked in the track of vortex ii .",
    "the tracks of the @xmath19 position ( fig .  [ positiontbs ] ) show the wake deflection observed for the rigid foil in this case , while in the case of the flexible foil the vortices are shed symmetrically .",
    "the difference between the @xmath18 position of vortex i in the rigid and flexible cases can be understood considering the deformation experienced by the flexible foil during the vortex formation process : when the flap changes the direction of motion , because of the foil deformation the tip position moves closer to the origin and so does the shed vortex .",
    "it follows from this observation that the two consecutive vortices of opposite sign shed at each flapping period , are closer in the rigid case than in the flexible case , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ schematbs ] . recalling that the symmetry - breaking in the wake directly depends on the relative self - advection velocity of the first dipolar structure in the near wake of the foil @xcite , the fact that flexibility keeps the newly shed vortex ( vortex i ) from being shed close enough to vortex ii to form a vortex pair can explain the observed inhibition of the deflected wake .",
    "is shown schematically in both cases , larger in the rigid case where the dipole is more compact . ]",
    "we study now the temporal evolution of the circulation during vortex formation .",
    "we define the time origin as the moment when the foil changes direction , which triggers the shedding of a vortex into the wake and marks the beginning of the growth process of a new vortex at the trailing edge of the foil .",
    "the circulation grows in time and rapidly tends toward a maximum value that remains relatively constant even after the next change in direction ( which restarts the formation process for the next opposite - signed vortex ) .",
    "this evolution can be seen in fig .",
    "[ circtbs ] . if we compare this circulation evolution for flexible and rigid foils , it appears clearly that the vortex in the wake of the flexible foil forms faster than in the case of the rigid foil .",
    "the link between vortex formation time and the force experienced by the foil can be qualitatively understood using the simple approach proposed by @xcite for a 2d wake vortex street , starting from the impulse formula that associates the force with the time derivative of the vorticity impulse ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath39 , where the fluid density is set to unity , the flow domain @xmath40 extends to infinity , @xmath41 $ ] is the position vector , @xmath42 the vorticity , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the two velocity components , and @xmath45 the unit vector perpendicular to the plane of motion . considering a vortex street modeled by point vortices , the projection of the impulse formula along the @xmath18 axis , gives the following approximate expression for the drag force : @xmath46 , where @xmath47 denotes the @xmath47-th vortex in the wake and @xmath48 its distance to the wake centerline .",
    "the hydrodynamic force is thus on the one hand intimately linked to the spatial arrangement of vortices in the wake , as well as to their sign and intensity .",
    "the other important point is that this unsteady contribution to the force coming from the vortices depends on the temporal evolution of the circulation .",
    "considering the comparison between the rigid and flexible foils of the present experiments , the faster formation of each vortex in the case of the flexible foil is therefore consistent with the observed increase in the propulsive force .    .",
    "errorbars show the difference between two methods of calculating the circulation using either the velocity or the vorticity fields . ]    in order to shed some light on the physical mechanism that determines the faster formation of vortices in the wake of the flexible foil we examine the velocity field in the near wake .",
    "we compare in fig .",
    "[ fig_comparaison ] , the velocity profile @xmath49 at the trailing edge of the foil for both cases ( along the white line represented on the absolute velocity fields in fig .",
    "[ fig_comparaison ] , left ) , at four different instants distributed over one foil oscillation period .",
    "the profiles for the rigid and flexible foils are similar , but a distinctive feature appears when the foil changes direction of oscillation ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) : the velocity jet near the tip of the foil is clearly more intense in the case of the flexible foil . the faster growth of the vortex circulation observed in fig .  [ circtbs ] can therefore be explained acknowledging that the flexible foil curvature enhances the flow around the trailing edge of the foil , locally accelerating the fluid that will feed the growing vortex .",
    "we may also note that this is compatible with another point observed in the previous section : in the flexible case , once the newly formed vortex is released into the wake it accelerates and catches up its delay with respect to the case of the rigid foil , ( see the @xmath18 position of vortex ii for both cases in fig .",
    "[ positiontbs ] ) .",
    "this transient faster initial advection velocity of the vortices can be explained by the deformation dynamics of the flexible structure : in the manner of a spring , after reaching its maximum deformation the foil structure comes back to its initial shape , contributing to accelerating the fluid in the near wake .",
    "we have shown that adding flexibility plays a strong dynamical role on the wake produced by a flapping foil . on the one hand ,",
    "the effective amplitude obtained passively due to the deformation of the flexible foil while flapping ( fig .",
    "[ aeff_st ] ) leads to an increase in the propulsive force with respect to the case of the rigid foil ( fig .",
    "[ force ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the interaction of the shed vortices with the flexible structure inhibits the trigger of the symmetry breaking of the reverse bnard - von krmn wake ( fig .",
    "[ phasespace]b ) , neutralizing thus the deflection of the propulsive jet that has been widely reported in the literature .",
    "the latter result , which is a novel observation , brings yet more evidence that wing compliance needs to be considered as a key parameter in the design of future flapping - propelled vehicles : since not only it is determinant for thrust and efficiency , but also as we show here because of its role in dictating the vortex dynamics that governs the stability properties of the wake .",
