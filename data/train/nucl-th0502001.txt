    "one also finds important uncertainties in masses , widths , or even in the very existence of some states .",
    "part of the difficulties in understanding the scalar sector may be ascribed to the fact that resonances can couple through intermediate states containing two identical pseudoscalar particles .",
    "about ten years ago this important aspect of the problem was discussed by trnqvist@xcite , who set a rather useful and comprehensive theoretical framework for describing the role of such couplings , based on the unitarized quark model .",
    "the interference of resonances was also considered by svec@xcite , using phase shifts and non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",

    "the intense activity on chiral perturbation theory performed in the last twenty years has made clear the convenience of working with non - linear realizations of the symmetry .",
