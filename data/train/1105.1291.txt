    "determining the phase diagram of a system is a central issue in many areas of physics .",
    "knowledge of the thermodynamic state of a system as a function of externally controlled variables ( e.g. , temperature , density , or magnetic field ) often provides important macroscopic information and can serve to help in identifying correlations among its microscopic constituents . a further determination of the nature of these correlations , which can be a consequence either of local interactions or of the cooperative behavior of a large number of constituents , is central to understanding the physical laws that govern the system .    in this key issue , we discuss the thermodynamics of two seemingly different types of systems : strongly interacting matter at extreme temperature and density , and high-@xmath0 compounds ( including cuprates and ferropnictides ) at finite temperature and doping .",
    "strongly interacting matter is governed by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "for qcd with two flavors of massless quarks , a chiral and/or deconfining phase transition is expected at a temperature of @xmath1mev for zero quark chemical potential  @xcite or at lower temperatures for a chemical potential as large as @xmath2mev  @xcite . in this latter regime ,",
    "attractive quark interactions may lead to a color - superconducting phase  @xcite .",
    "the high density end of the phase diagram is relevant for the physics of dense stars  @xcite ; the lower densities are relevant for relativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite where it is hoped that unambiguous signatures of this phase transition can be observed .",
    "the energy scales appropriate for the description of high-@xmath0 materials are evidently much ( i.e. , roughly @xmath3 times ) smaller . for low doping , these materials exhibit an antiferromagnetic phase ( af ) with transition temperatures of @xmath4k to @xmath5k . for higher doping ,",
    "these materials exist in a superconducting phase ( sc ) with a transition temperature of tens of degrees kelvin .",
    "this schematic picture can be refined to obtain a very rich phase structure with coexisting magnetic and pairing correlations and a variety of complex phenomena including stripes and pseudogaps  @xcite .",
    "the basic mechanism for pairing is not well understood , and identifying the manner in which af and sc phases dominate or coexist in the competition for the same electrons may be helpful in eliminating certain scenarios  @xcite .",
    "both qcd and high-@xmath0 materials are characterized by strong correlations among their microscopic constituents , and there is no indication in either case of a suitable `` small parameter '' that could lead to a meaningful perturbative description .",
    "both systems would appear to be too complicated to permit analytic descriptions .",
    "even numerical approaches are either extremely challenging or impossible as a consequence of the fundamental fermion sign problem  ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "for each of these systems , numerical investigations yield highly oscillatory integrals that can prevent their simulation using techniques based on importance sampling .",
    "given this situation , it may be useful to begin from the observation that these phase transitions are associated with the breaking of a symmetry ( e.g. , the staggered magnetization of af breaks the spin rotational symmetry of the system ) .    in this key issue",
    ", we describe how an approach based on random matrix theory ( rmt ) can provide useful information regarding the possible phase diagrams for a variety of systems .",
    "central to this approach is the identification of relevant symmetries and their consequences for the macroscopic properties of the system .",
    "the basic ideas of random matrix theory ( rmt ) were introduced by wigner when studying the complex spectra of intermediate and heavy nuclei  @xcite .",
    "his rationale can be summarized as follows : although the detailed properties of the lowest energy states of nuclei could be understood by means of model hamiltonians , there was no hope that this approach could explain the excited resonances observed with neutrons of energy up to several hundred ev .",
    "these states were far too numerous and too closely spaced to permit detailed modelling .",
    "it was deemed to be both possible and more meaningful to determine the _ statistical _ properties of an ensemble of states , such as their density in a given energy interval or the distribution of their energy spacings and widths .",
    "this was achieved by constructing hamiltonians with a structure that was directly dictated by the quantum physics of nuclei , but which otherwise contained matrix elements that were drawn at random on an appropriate distribution .",
    "the statistical properties of the highly excited resonances were then obtained by performing suitable ensemble averages analytically .",
    "the central elements of this construction were the random and the deterministic parts of the hamiltonians . here",
    ", the random part of the hamiltonian was not intended to describe randomly fluctuating processes or statistical disorder .",
    "randomness was rather used as a statistical instrument : one considered a large ensemble of nuclei , each having a different hamiltonian , and determined the properties of a group of nuclei by computing ensemble averages .",
    "the deterministic part of the hamiltonian provided constraints on the resulting statistical properties .",
    "initially , this deterministic structure was that dictated by the time - reversal symmetry of the strong interaction , which implies that the hamiltonian can be written as a real symmetric matrix . by choosing statistical distributions so that ensemble averages were representative of the vast majority of the nuclei considered , the resulting properties were shown to be independent of the detailed dynamics of the nuclear interactions .",
    "only the underlying symmetries were important .",
    "these early ideas have evolved considerably since , and random matrix theory is now applied in many branches of nuclear , condensed matter , and particle physics .",
    "still , in each case , symmetry plays a central role .",
    "this key issue will focus on the application of random matrix theory to the study of phase diagrams in systems where different symmetries compete thermodynamically . as in the early work of wigner ,",
    "random matrix theory is well suited for this task when the considered systems exhibit many intermixing energy states whose detailed properties are largely unknown or very difficult to determine . starting from model hamiltonians constrained by symmetries and generic mechanisms , the results are expected to be broadly representative of an ensemble of systems respecting these constraints .",
    "ensemble averaging will eliminate details specific to individual hamiltonians , and the features of the resulting phase diagram should thus be sufficiently robust that they will emerge in `` almost all '' specific cases .    before considering this specific application",
    ", we wish to clarify the context in which it has been developed . nowadays",
    ", random matrix theory encompasses a vast domain of research which has been reviewed in many works .",
    "( a non - exhaustive list is available in  @xcite . )",
    "the consequences of symmetry constraints can be studied at two different levels  microscopic and macroscopic .",
    "microscopic investigations deal with the correlations of the eigenenergies of the system on the scale of the average spacing",
    ". examples of rmt predictions at this level include the spectral properties of nuclear resonances , atomic energy levels , sound waves in quartz crystals , transmission modes in quantum dots , and the eigenvalues of the qcd dirac operator .",
    "one of the most important microscopic results is universality .",
    "when rmt applies , eigenvalue correlations are not only dictated by the symmetries of the system but are also independent of the details of the statistical distributions used to generate the ensemble averages .",
    "( see , e.g. , section 7 of  @xcite ) .    the second , macroscopic level of description deals with the consequences of the underlying symmetries on the global state of the random matrix system .",
    "this is the level of the models considered below . here , the central quantity is the partition function , from which the phase competition can be determined as a function of the variables of the theory such as temperature or chemical potential .",
    "the resulting phase diagram is a direct consequence of the symmetries of the system , and it is of interest to study their robustness with respect to variations of the coupling constants of the theory . at this stage",
    ", it is useful to note one detail of the random matrix approach : matrix elements are drawn independently in such a way that all basis states are treated equally .",
    "such ` democratic treatment ' naturally implies that random matrix models are mean - field models .",
    "these two levels of description are closely related to one another . for instance , in qcd with two massless flavors , it is observed that the smallest eigenvalues of the dirac operator in vacuum accumulate near the origin of the spectrum .",
    "this accumulation is directly related to the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry , as expressed by the banks - casher relationship which provides a direct connection between the average spectral density near the origin and the chiral order parameter  @xcite .",
    "another strong relationship can be seen in the fact that many macroscopic properties are ` inherited ' from symmetry constraints imposed at the microscopic level . as will be shown below , the random matrix partition function near the critical lines can be expanded as a power series in the order parameters . in this sense , rmt bears a strong resemblance to ginsburg - landau theory .",
    "in contrast to the ginsburg - landau approach , however , the coefficients in the random matrix expansion _ can not _ be freely chosen but must satisfy relationships resulting from the form of the microscopic random matrix interactions .",
    "these constraints can preclude the occurrence of some symmetry breaking patterns .",
    "thus , rmt can be used to determine the minimum number of symmetries which must be imposed at the microscopic level in order to reproduce a given phase structure .    in this key issue , we describe the basic steps required to construct random matrix models for phase diagrams . in the interests of readability ,",
    "we have not attempted to provide technical details .",
    "emphasis is rather placed on the ongoing simplification that arises in this construction , from the many variance parameters and complicated block structure needed to describe the random matrix interactions at the microscopic level to the few parameter ratios and elementary functional forms that characterize the thermodynamic potential .",
    "we start with two basic models in section  [ s : two - models ] .",
    "the first describes chiral symmetry breaking in qcd , which is related to a quark - antiquark order parameter of the form @xmath6 ( in euclidean conventions ) .",
    "the second is the case of an attractive phonon - like interaction , which produces pairing states with an order parameter of the form @xmath7 . in section  [ s : qcdvstc ] , we summarize our previous work on qcd and high-@xmath0 superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "although different in nature , these systems exhibit phase structures with striking similarities in their symmetry breaking patterns . in particular , we discuss the conditions required for the occurrence of either a tetracritical or a bicritical point , corresponding respectively to the presence or the absence of a phase with mixed broken symmetries . in section  [",
    "s : oxy ] , this discussion is extended to a tentative model for iron arsenide compounds with an @xmath8 order parameter , and we discuss the possibility that this system can have a state with coexisting magnetic and superconducting correlations .",
    "section  [ s : conclusions ] presents final remarks regarding the random matrix approach to phase diagrams as well as a selected list of open problems .",
    "as a first illustration of the random matrix approach , we consider a model for chiral symmetry breaking in qcd with two light flavors , leading to an order parameter of the form @xmath6 . working in euclidean space and assuming a zero vacuum angle , the qcd partition function for fixed quark chemical potential , @xmath9 , and temperature , @xmath10 , is given as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the euclidean action @xmath13 here , @xmath14 and @xmath15 describe quark and antiquark fields of mass @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the number of flavors .",
    "quarks interact via the exchange of gluon fields , @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the generators of the @xmath20 color algebra ( with @xmath21 throughout this section ) , and the coupling arises via the euclidean dirac operator @xmath22 where the @xmath23 are hermitean .",
    "( @xmath24 is the matrix coupled to the time derivative @xmath25 . )",
    "the dynamics of the gluon fields is contained in the quadratic term , @xmath26 , where @xmath27,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the trace is carried over colors , and @xmath28 is a coupling constant . as described in the introduction , the resulting interactions are too complex to be solved exactly , and one must resort to approximations .",
    "the random matrix approach starts from symmetry considerations : in the chiral limit , @xmath29 , the qcd partition function is invariant under su(@xmath30)@xmath31su(@xmath30 ) .",
    "nevertheless , chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken to su@xmath32(@xmath30 ) in the vacuum  @xcite . in the early 90 s",
    ", it was discovered that chiral symmetry breaking could be seen in the dynamics of the small eigenvalues of the dirac operator under fluctuations of the gauge field configurations .",
    "it was already known from the work of banks and casher  @xcite that the chiral order parameter , @xmath33 , can be expressed as an accumulation of the eigenvalues near zero virtuality .",
    "( the actual relationship will be made explicit below in equation  ( [ bk ] ) . ) in 1992 , leutwyler and smilga derived further sum rules for the spectrum of the dirac operator , which are dominated by the eigenvalues near zero virtuality  @xcite . in 1993 ,",
    "shuryak and verbaarschot  @xcite introduced a random matrix model for chiral symmetry breaking , where the qcd partition function in vacuum is approximated as @xmath34\\nonumber\\\\ \\times\\exp\\big(-   n    \\sigma^2\\,{\\rm",
    "tr}[w w^\\dagger]\\big ) .",
    "\\label{zrmtxsb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this approach , it is expected that the spectrum of the dirac operator , @xmath35 , has the same properties as @xmath36 provided the model satisfies the same global symmetries as qcd . in particular , in the chiral limit @xmath37 the dirac operator should anticommute with @xmath38 .",
    "working in the basis of the eigenstates of @xmath38 , @xmath39 must therefore have the block structure @xmath40 where @xmath41 is an @xmath42 complex matrix which models the qcd interactions .",
    "the choice of complex elements corresponds to the chiral unitary ensemble ( chgue ) , which is relevant for fermions in the fundamental representation .",
    "there exists two other ensembles , the chiral orthogonal ( chgoe ) and chiral symplectic ( chgse ) ensembles , which are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the interactions are now materially simplified .",
    "the quadratic term @xmath43 in the action ( [ qcdaction ] ) is replaced by drawing the matrix elements of @xmath41 on a gaussian distribution with zero mean and inverse variance @xmath44 .",
    "hence , an ensemble average is made over gauge field configurations .",
    "the corresponding number of degrees of freedom is proportional to @xmath45 , which serves as the volume of the system and is to be taken to infinity at the end of the calculations ( i.e. , the thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "note that the matrix elements @xmath46 are drawn on the same distribution for all @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "in other words , the random matrix interactions are independent of the choice of basis states . as a result",
    ", no spatial range can be specified .",
    "the only scale introduced is that of the interaction strength , @xmath49 .    given the form of equation ( [ dirac ] ) , the spectrum of @xmath50 has the desired properties . because the dirac operator anticommutes with @xmath38",
    ", eigenvalues occur in pairs @xmath51 with eigenstates @xmath52 and @xmath53 , so that the spectrum is symmetric about @xmath54 .",
    "chiral symmetry is however spontaneously broken in the ground state .",
    "the chiral order parameter can be obtained from the banks - casher relationship  @xcite as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the average spectral density .",
    "note that the different limits in ( [ bk ] ) do not commute .",
    "they must be taken in the order indicated since eigenvalues accumulate near @xmath57 as @xmath45 is taken to infinity .",
    "( in particular , it can be seen that reversing the @xmath58 and @xmath59 limits would give zero , since @xmath60 for any finite @xmath45 as a consequence of the @xmath61 symmetry noted above . )",
    "further properties of the spectrum were shown to match those of qcd ( for eigenenergies @xmath62 ) .",
    "first , the model of equations ( [ zrmtxsb ] ) and ( [ dirac ] ) was shown to obey the qcd leutwyler - smilga sum rules  @xcite .",
    "second , direct comparisons with data from numerical simulations of qcd on a lattice showed that the spectrum of the dirac operator simulated at the scale of the average energy spacing ( the ` microscopic level density ' ) agrees with the random matrix predictions within computational uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "all together , these results demonstrated that the eigenvalue correlations near @xmath57 are a direct consequence of the underlying chiral symmetry and do not depend on the specifics of the interactions . in that sense , the correlations are universal .",
    "of course , qcd could have been an `` exceptional '' theory with spectral correlators different from the ensemble average . the fact that it is",
    "not the case provides encouragement that random matrix arguments can also offer insight into its macroscopic properties .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking can be studied at a macroscopic level with the aid of the thermodynamic potential .",
    "the chiral random matrix model can be solved exactly by standard methods .",
    "there are three steps .",
    "first , the matrix elements @xmath46 are integrated over to give  @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 is an effective quartic interaction potential given as @xmath65 second , each fermion bilinear is expressed as combinations of squares which can then be linearized by means of a hubbard - stratonovitch transformation @xmath66 which introduces an auxiliary variable , @xmath67 . focusing on the term relevant for chiral condensation , only one such auxiliary variable , @xmath68 ,",
    "is considered , and the partition function becomes @xmath69 with a thermodynamic potential @xmath70 where we have assumed @xmath71 for simplicity .",
    "interestingly , the function @xmath72 is even in the limit @xmath73 , reflecting chiral symmetry . for the final step , the integral on the right side of equation ( [ zafoomega ] ) can be solved exactly in the thermodynamic limit @xmath74 by the saddle - point method , as @xmath75 . in the chiral limit @xmath76 , the minimum of @xmath72 is simply given as @xmath77 the corresponding chiral condensate in vacuum is then @xmath78 note again that the thermodynamic limit must be taken first to produce a meaningful result . in conclusion ,",
    "the vacuum state has a non - zero order parameter as a result of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "this analysis can be extended to finite temperature and density in order to describe the complete phase diagram . technically ,",
    "@xmath10 and the chemical potential , @xmath9 , are introduced in the dirac operator by the fermion matsubara frequencies @xmath79 ( where @xmath45 is an integer ) .",
    "in other words , @xmath39 is replaced by @xmath80 , and the partition function is summed over the @xmath81 s  @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic potential can again be determined by following the procedure described above .",
    "the result is simply @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a constant proportional to @xmath84 .",
    "note the structure of the logarithm term , which can be rewritten as @xmath85 , where @xmath86 represent the quark ( @xmath87 ) and antiquark ( @xmath88 ) single quasiparticle energies in a fixed auxiliary field , @xmath68 .",
    "a simplified potential can be obtained by restricting the frequency sum to the two smallest frequencies , @xmath89 and @xmath90  @xcite .",

    "high-@xmath0 materials resemble each other in significant ways .",
    "we already stressed that chiral symmetry is restored abruptly as the quark chemical potential is increased just as antiferromagnetic order vanishes in the presence of a sufficiently strong magnetic field . in each case , the varying external field is not coupled to the order parameter directly but rather exhausts enough degrees of freedom to destroy the initial order .",
    "for each of these systems , we allow for the additional possibility of a thermodynamic competition between pairing and chiral / antiferromagnetic order .",
    "a major distinction between these two systems is that only two colors participate in the pairing state of qcd while all spins contribute to the @xmath187wave order parameter of high-@xmath0 materials .",

    "the problem could then be approached by writing an effective two - body potential at the level of the quartic term @xmath64 of equation  ( [ y - xsb ] ) .",
    "the question is to identify the most effective two - body potential which accurately describes the interactions between the lowest - lying degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "this is for instance the approach followed by the hubbard or the t - j model .",
    "we adopted a quite different approach by starting at the deeper microscopic level of the action , where we postulated the existence of a generic interaction carried by the exchange of either density or spin fluctuations . in some sense , this would describe a glue interaction where lorentz invariance is broken but rotational symmetry is preserved . following the spirit of the models discussed above , no further specifications are made on the dynamics of interactions , whose matrix elements are drawn again on gaussian distributions .",
    "a last , but not essential , element of the construction is the addition in the action of a spin - independent term @xmath224 with @xmath225 which mimics nearest neighbor hopping .",

    "( e.g. , see the discussion in  @xcite and references therein . ) here , only the first scenario of a first - order transition is found in all cases .",
    "a third discrepancy can be observed in the absence ( for hole doped materials ) of a pseudogap region separating the af and sc phases .",
    "we will make further comments on the last two discrepancies in the end of this section .",
    "returning to the similarities between the random matrix models for qcd and high-@xmath0 materials , limitations regarding the extension of some phases can be found in both cases . in qcd ,",
    "a microscopic theory would contain the same logarithmic singularity as that present in the right side of equation ( [ gapeqph ] ) so that the diquark phase would extend to arbitrarily high @xmath9 . in the high-@xmath0 model , a similar singularity exists in the gap equation for af  @xcite and results in an antiferromagnetic phase that exists independent of the hopping strength @xmath94 . in the random matrix model , by contrast",
    ", @xmath94 must be kept below a threshold value for the af to be realized  @xcite .",
    "as discussed earlier in subsection  [ ss : ph ] , these discrepancies are acceptable in a mean - field approach as they concern situations where the condensates are weak and thus fragile .    a striking difference can be observed in the thermodynamic competition between the order parameters when comparing the diagrams in figures  [ f : qcd - pd ] and  [ f : hightc - pd ] .",
    "both types of systems support the coexistence of different phases along a first - order line .",
    "the two competing phases then coexist at a given temperature with different densities .",
    "they form an inhomogeneous state whose detailed spatial structure depends on the energetic cost of creating an interface .",
    "clearly , such a description is beyond the simple approach considered here .",
    "a completely different situation occurs for the quark systems only . as @xmath125 is increased in favor of color - superconductivity ( with values that are no longer representative of qcd ) , a tetracritical point",
    " the meeting point of four different continuous transition lines  appears .",
    "the transition from one phase to the other then proceeds continuously through an intermediate phase of mixed broken symmetry , where both orders coexist in a spatially homogeneous phase . for the high-@xmath0 system ,",
    "such a mixed broken symmetry state is absent",
    ". at best , a bicritical point appears , marking the end of a first - order line with its discontinuous transition .",
    "the absence of a tetracritical point in the high-@xmath0 case is a direct result of the absence of ungapped excitations .",
    "the conditions for the observation of a tetracritical point can be determined by expanding the thermodynamic potential of equation ( [ pot - both ] ) as a power series @xmath253 where the coefficients are known functions of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the af state makes a transition to a paramagnetic state along the line @xmath254 , whereas the superconducting gap vanishes along the second - order line @xmath255 .",
    "a critical point arises at the crossing of those two lines . a mixed broken symmetry phase ( with non - zero values of both @xmath68 and @xmath130 )",
    "can be stable near this critical point provided that the coefficients of the quartic terms satisfy the inequality @xmath256  @xcite . in this case , the critical point is a tetracrictical one . in the opposite case ,",
    "@xmath257 , the critical point is only bicritical . for the high-@xmath0 model , it can be shown that @xmath258 for all values of @xmath125 .",
    "if a small fraction , @xmath192 , of the excitations were forced to be ungapped , @xmath259 would become positive for a range of values of @xmath125 near unity , and a tetracritical point would be present for those couplings .",
    "although the mixed broken symmetry phase is never realized as a global minimum of the thermodynamic potential of the high-@xmath0 model , it is always an unstable solution of the gap equations , i.e. , a saddle - point of @xmath260 .",
    "further , the difference in energy between this state and the global minimum of @xmath260 is small on the scale of the inverse variance .",
    "this suggests that the existence of a mixed broken symmetry phase is a delicate matter .",
    "it may well occur in specific dynamic models or in calculations more detailed than those presented here , e.g. , calculations beyond mean - field level , but the demonstration that its appearance is robust may be challenging .",
    "this is an example of useful information that can be obtained from a random matrix approach even though a precise assessment of those effects requires more than the mean - field treatment of random matrix theory .",
    "a question related to the occurrence of critical points is whether the theory exhibits , approximately or exactly , condensation patterns of higher symmetry near these points",
    ". this would be the case , for instance , if the series expansion of @xmath260 could be expressed as a polynomial in a single variable , i.e. , a linear combination of @xmath261 and @xmath262 . in such a case , the different phase transitions could be described as a rotation of a metavector order parameter constructed with both @xmath68 and @xmath130 , in the manner of the so(5 ) theory of superconductivity of zhang  @xcite or the o(10 ) theories that have been proposed for qcd  @xcite .",
    "we have found no indications of such higher symmetry in the vicinity of a critical point for either the quark or the high - tc systems described here .",
    "there is one interesting case : in the high-@xmath0 model in the limit @xmath263 , the potential of equation ( [ pot - both ] ) becomes a function of the combination @xmath264 provided that @xmath265 .",
    "this higher symmetry is manifest only at @xmath97 and is broken for @xmath266 in favor of an sc ground state .",
    "we end this discussion with some comments on possible extensions of the model for high-@xmath0 superconductors .",
    "the present construction is based on only a few elements , and we have shown how it can help in identifying symmetry - related results . at the same time , the model can not be expected to describe the entire spectrum of materials , which can greatly differ in their detailed microscopic interactions .",
    "we have noted that some of this variety can be encoded in the choices for the variances to be associated with scattering processes between the different states of the first brillouin zone .",
    "the strength of these matrix elements can most likely be probed by two - point correlation functions such as spin or density susceptibilities , which are experimentally accessible .",
    "further work is needed in this direction .",
    "we also mentioned earlier the lack of a pseudogap phase in the random matrix phase diagram .",
    "a pseudogap region is thought to arise as a result either of correlations competing with the af and sc orders or from preformed cooper pairs leading to large phase fluctuations in the pairing field  @xcite .",
    "we have not attempted to model the pseudogap phenomenon here but can offer tentative indications of the effort that would be required in this direction : the scenario of a competing order could in principle be taken into account by decomposing the four - fermion random matrix potential @xmath64 simultaneaously into the af , sc , and the pseudogap channels ( provided one can make meaningful `` sign approximations '' similar to those of the sc channel ) and by constructing a new thermodynamic potential .",
    "the difficulties that could arise in this approach would be the lack of a true density of states distributed around a fermi sea .",
    "this would make it difficult to obtain a faithful description of the fermi arc phenomenology but might still capture some of the interesting physics .",
    "the scenario of phase fluctuations is less easily addressed in the present approach , since the degrees of freedom associated with the fluctuations need to be introduced explicitly in the model .",
    "as an example of a possible extension of the models discussed so far , we turn to the recently discovered ferropnictides , which constitute another class of type - ii superconducting materials exhibiting magnetic and superconducting correlations .",
    "a current discussion of the iron arsenide compounds concerns the symmetry of the pairing state and its relationship to the phase diagram .",
    "it has been claimed by several authors  @xcite that the occurrence of a mixed broken symmetry phase would constitute an evidence for a pairing with an @xmath267 symmetry , as opposed to the conventional @xmath268-wave .",
    "this claim relies on the observation that @xmath267 pairing leads to a mixed broken symmetry state if the two following conditions are met : the system has a finite chemical potential breaking the particle - hole symmetry , and the electron band is elliptic whereas the hole band is circular .",
    "in contrast , an @xmath268 state meeting these two conditions does not lead to a mixed broken symmetry state  @xcite .",
    "the main elements of the corresponding microscopic theory are the following  @xcite : the electronic structure of the system shows two hole pockets at the center of the first brillouin zone and electron pockets shifted at either @xmath269 or @xmath270 ( for a square lattice with one fe atom per cell ) .",
    "an af state may develop with a form similar to equation ( [ af - op - microscopic ] ) , where the sum over states @xmath271 is now carried over one type of pocket , whereas the corresponding @xmath272 states with @xmath273 belong to the other type of pocket . in the @xmath267 pairing state ,",
    "the gap function changes sign from the hole pockets to the electron pockets , whereas an @xmath268 gap function assumes the same sign in all pockets .",
    "it is of interest to see how the model presented in the previous section should be modified to describe such materials . following  @xcite , we assume two electronic bands shifted by the momentum @xmath274 with respect to each other",
    ". one can easily partition the first brillouin in four equivalent regions related to one another by a shift in @xmath229 or by momentum reflection .",
    "the af correlator then takes the same form given in equation ( [ gammaaf ] ) .",
    "similarly , the sign change that is characteristic of an @xmath275-wave state turns out to be represented correctly by the matrix in ( [ gammasc - d ] ) .",
    "finally , by collapsing each of the electron and hole bands into a single energy term , e.g. , @xmath276 for electrons and @xmath277 for holes , the corresponding single - fermion hamiltonian is now described by a term @xmath278 , where @xmath228 is given in ( [ gammat ] ) with the term @xmath279 replaced by a simple multiplicative factor , @xmath276 .    by postulating random matrix interactions of the same form as in the model of the previous section ,",
    "the resulting thermodynamic potential is precisely that of equation ( [ pot - both ] ) , for which all excitations are gapped .",
    "thus , the phase diagrams are the same as those for the cuprates , and the random matrix model would preclude the occurrence of a mixed broken symmetry state . this is not inconsistent with the conclusions of @xcite since only one of two required conditions are met by the random matrix interactions . here",
    "the model ignores the ellipticity of the electron bands .",
    "however , according to the discussion of the previous section , a mixed broken symmetry state might arise if some of the excitations do not participate in pairing , i.e. a fraction of the excitations are ungapped .",
    "two more results can be derived : first , following  @xcite and assuming equal coefficients for the quadratic terms of equation ( [ pot - both ] ) , i.e. , @xmath280 , one finds that the critical point @xmath96 is located on the @xmath97 axis and has a _ vanishing",
    "_ coefficent @xmath281 .",
    "this point is thus at the verge of becoming a tetracritical one .",
    "in contrast , assuming an @xmath268 state and fixing @xmath282 yields a critical point which has @xmath258 and is thus bicritical . these results are consistent with the microsocopic model of  @xcite .",
    "the above findings demonstrate that the random matrix model already captures many elements of the physics contained in the microscopic model of  @xcite",
    ". it will be interesting to see whether the ellipticity of the electron states might also be mimicked in the random matrix approach and how it might affect the results .",
    "we have reviewed the construction of random matrix models for the phase diagrams of a variety of systems .",
    "the general strategy starts at the level of the action with a description of the interactions between fermions and exchange fluctuation fields .",
    "these interactions assume the form of matrices with a global block structure dictated by the symmetries of the theory .",
    "the detailed form of the interactions is simplified materially by drawing matrix elements in the individual blocks at random .",
    "the result is a mean - field model which is exactly soluble .",
    "the corresponding thermodynamic potential has a simple structure involving only a minimal number of parameters and an explicit sum over matsubara frequencies .",
    "this form is perfectly suitable for numerical purposes , but even greater simplification can be obtained by truncating this sum to a single term .",
    "while this truncation has quantitative consequences , it does not alter the topology of the resulting phases for the cases considered .    despite  or even because of",
    " the many simplifying approximations made , we believe that this approach to phase diagrams can be of value .",
    "in many calculations , it can be difficult to distinguish between solid results that are protected by the underlying symmetries of the problem and more tentative result that depend on the specific model investigated . by performing an ensemble average over theories ,",
    "the results of the random matrix approach are dictated by symmetries alone .",
    "they can thus provide guidance in identifying model - dependent and model - independent features .",
    "similarly , they can be useful in understanding the minimal number of symmetry constraints required to reproduce specific phase structures .",
    "the great simplicity of the thermodynamic potential obtained in these calculations makes it easy to check the robustness of predictions with respect to variations in the description of the interaction .",
    "we also note that near critical points , random matrix models bear strong similarities to ginsburg - landau theories with the advantage of the presence of additional constraints , which are inherited from the symmetries of the random matrix interactions",
    ". the freely - adjustable parameters of ginsburg - landau theory are replaced by known functions of temperature and chemical potential . as we have demonstrated above , these constraints",
    "can be extremely helpful in ruling out certain topologies in the phase diagram .",
    "difficulties associated with the thermodynamic limit can be formidable when calculating the phase diagram .",
    "the analysis in the previous sections showed that the partition function is exponentially small in the volume of the system .",
    "moreover , the thermodynamic limit does not commute with other limits in the system . as a result",
    ", care must be taken in cases where low - energy metastable states exist , as their contribution to the partition function may be difficult to be distinguished from that of the ground state . in such circumstances , a random matrix model can be useful in identifying the metastable states . for systems with a finite fermion chemical potential",
    ", the situation can be significantly worse .",
    "for example , the qcd dirac operator is complex as a consequence of the fermion sign problem , and numerical calculations with traditional sampling methods are precluded . in such cases ,",
    "random matrix methods represent one of the few options available .    in the form presented here",
    ", random matrix models can be extended to any system where the fermions are the main degrees of freedom , the symmetries of the interaction are central to the problem , and the detailed dynamics of the exchange fields plays a secondary role .",
    "the model can be realized in either of two ways : the simplest approach consists of constructing the thermodynamic potential directly .",
    "this requires the identification of the auxiliary fields to be associated with the order parameters of the system and the determination of the single fermion energies in a fixed background of those fields .",
    "the remaining parameters could then be chosen freely .",
    "the richer approach adopted here is to start at the deeper level of the action .",
    "the reward for this extra effort is insight regarding the constraints that are imposed as a consequence of the symmetries of the interactions and their effect on the global properties of the system .",
    "the various examples presented here indicate that a random matrices offer an interesting approach to the construction of phase diagrams",
    ". however , a number of open question remain :    * * fermion sign problem*. although the random matrix model can be solved at finite chemical potential  using a saddle - point method which becomes exact in the thermodynamic limit  numerical calculation of the same model are plagued by the fermion sign problem .",
    "difficulties present at the microscopic level apparently disappear when working at a macroscopic level .",
    "the open question is thus to understand the resolution of this apparent contradiction and to see whether this mechanism can be exploited to ease the fermion sign problem .",
    "considerable work in this direction has been performed in a qcd context ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , where an interesting deterministic pattern in the sign oscillations of the fermion determinant has been seen . * * the nature of the interactions at the microscopic level*. the random matrix model for high-@xmath0 was inspired by earlier models for qcd . given this background",
    ", it was natural to identify the interactions at the more microscopic level as being mediated by the exchange of density and spin fluctuations .",
    "is this structure generic , and can it represent other kinds of interactions , e.g. , a static superexchange ? * * eigenvalue correlation for sc and af states*. in section  [ ss : chiral ] we noted that correlations due to chiral symmetry in qcd could be analyzed either at the microscopic level of the dirac spectrum or at the level of the phase diagram .",
    "a similar analysis has not been performed either for the pairing state in qcd or for the af and sc states in high-@xmath0 superconductivity .",
    "it would be of interest to see if the symmetries underlying these states induce similar microscopic correlations for a suitable single particle operator .",
    "such an analysis might require the construction of an analogue of the banks - casher relationship .",
    "* * summations over matsubara frequencies*. since our primary concern has been to determine the physically realizable topologies of phase diagrams , we were willing to make simplifications in the thermodynamic potential which preserved their topology .",
    "this led us to truncate the infinite sum over matsubara frequencies given by ( [ omegarmcsb ] ) by a single term .",
    "the resulting form , given by ( [ omegasimple ] ) , is sufficiently simple that it can be studied ` by hand ' , but it is quantitatively different from the full result",
    ". it would be interesting to determine the extent to which the full random matrix result of ( [ omegarmcsb ] ) can provide a quantitative description of model systems for which the phase diagram can be constructed reliably .",
    "a related question is whether the inequality @xmath283 for all @xmath125 , found for both high-@xmath0 and iron arsenide materials , holds for the full result .",
    "a direct comparison with the microscopic theory of  @xcite shows that @xmath259 has the same sign in both the random matrix approach and in the microscopic theory when @xmath125 is near @xmath284",
    ". it would be interesting to see if this result remains valid in other cases . * * why do random matrix models work ? *",
    "we end this discussion by offering some admittedly speculative suggestions about the origin of the success of random matrix theory .",
    "consider a real gas that obeys the ideal gas law .",
    "interactions between its molecules are strong , but their role is strictly limited to the establishment of a statistical population of the states .",
    "the properties of the gas then follow from purely statistical arguments that are independent of the nature of the underlying molecular interactions .",
    "( clearly , no one would consider attempting to determine the details of the molecular interaction from the ideal gas law . )",
    "similar ideas form the basis of niels bohrs compound nucleus model  @xcite .",
    "it is presumed that the energy of an incoming particle is rapidly distributed statistically among the constituent nucleons .",
    "the description of the eventual decay of the excited state is determined solely by this statistical distribution and is independent of the details of the formation process .",
    "this is directly related to wigner s ideas that random matrix theory should apply whenever single - particle energy levels are strongly intermixed and contribute in an equilibrated or ` democratic ' way to physical observables . to the extent that these notions can be extended to encompass the thermodynamic properties of qcd or high-@xmath0 materials , the decision to replace the exact action by an ensemble average should be legitimate .",
    "the phase diagram inherits only the symmetries of the underlying action and is independent of its detailed properties . +",
    "two additional clues point to the importance of strong energy level mixing . in 1984 ,",
    "bohigas , giannoni , and schmit observed that the level correlations of the sinai billiard  a quantum system with a chaotically behaved classical analog  were consistent with the predictions of rmt ( in this case , those of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ) .",
    "they further conjectured that rmt should correctly predict the spectral correlators of any system whose classical analog is chaotic  @xcite . here ,",
    "qcd and high-@xmath0 superconductivity are both described by non - linear field theories . the corresponding classical theories , and even more so the quantum many - body theories , are expected to be chaotic ( i.e. , ergodic ) in nature .",
    "+ a second indication for the need for energy mixing comes from observed limitations on the range of validity of the rmt description of spectral correlators . in principle , rmt is expected to provide an exact description of all spectral correlators on an energy scale which is vanishingly small compared to the full support of the spectrum . in practice , rmt predictions for many systems ( including qcd ) agree for eigenvalues with are smaller than the so - called thouless energy , @xmath285  ( e.g. , see  @xcite ) .",
    "this scale can be determined using ideas from localization theory , where @xmath285 is inversely proportional to the time required for a particle to diffuse across the system . for energies greater than @xmath286 ,",
    "a particle crosses the system in a time that is too short to resolve individual states .",
    "given that the reflections at boundaries scatter the particle to other energy states , a large number of individual energy states end up contributing to the wave function , thus yielding the apparent democracy underlying the rmt description .",
    "+ ultimately , a strong argument for the value of the random matrix approach to phase diagrams should rely on clues for universality on both microscopic and macroscopic scales .",
    "for a chiral random matrix model of qcd at zero @xmath9 and with a temperature dependence given by the two lowest matsubara frequencies , it was shown that the thermodynamic approach and the banks - casher relationship yield exactly the same chiral condensate as a function of temperature  @xcite .",
    "these results strongly suggest that the physical content of the thermodynamic approach is actually dominated by the microscopic spectral density  which we believe to be universal . for @xmath287 and @xmath111 , it was strongly argued that a random matrix model with the global symmetries of qcd yield a microscopic spectral density of the same form as that of the qcd dirac operator  @xcite .",
    "if similar connections can be established over most the ( @xmath9,@xmath10 ) plane and extended to a temperature dependence that includes all matsubara frequencies , then one can expect that the phase diagrams that we constructed can be justified on the basis of the universality of the corresponding microscopic correlators .",
    "it would be of particular interest to see if there is a relation between the inequality for @xmath259 identified for the phase diagrams of superconducting materials and the properties of the microscopic correlators .",
    "this also indicates that there is considerable interest in studying the microscopic spectral properties of condensed matter systems !",
    "one final open question remains : why is the random matrix approach described here so rarely used in the study of phase diagrams ?",
    "the answer probably lies in the fact that the starting form of the random matrix can be dauntingly complicated .",
    "for example , the block form of the random matrix appropriate for the description of the color and spin symmetries of qcd  ( [ blockform ] ) is @xmath288 and contains @xmath289 component matrices . as we have attempted to explain , these complications disappear step - by - step as one follows the relatively direct path towards the thermodynamic potential of ( [ omegarmcsb ] ) and the even simpler ( but topologically equivalent ) form of ( [ omegasimple ] ) .",
    "given the model - independence of the final phase diagram and the merits of this approach relative to ginsburg - landau theory as noted above , we believe that the initial investment in constructing the random matrix is richly rewarded and can be recommended ."
