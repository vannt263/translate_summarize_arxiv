    "studies of the distribution of carbon monoxide ( co ) emission in external galaxies ( _ _ cf . _ _",
    "@xcite ) have pointed to the presence of large quantities of molecular material in these systems .",
    "these studies have yielded a detailed picture of the molecular mass in many external galaxies .",
    "but , because emission from the abundant co molecule is generally dominated by radiative transfer effects , such as high optical depth , it is not a reliable monitor of the physical conditions , such as spatial density and kinetic temperature , quantities necessary to assess the possibility of star formation . emission from less - abundant , higher - dipole moment molecules are better - suited to the task of deriving the spatial density and kinetic temperature of the dense gas in our and external galaxies .",
    "for this reason , emission line studies from a variety of molecules have been made toward mainly nearby galaxies ( see @xcite ( cs ) , @xcite ( hcn ) , @xcite ( hco@xmath6 ) , @xcite and @xcite ( hc@xmath7n ) , @xcite ( nh@xmath7 ) , or @xcite for a review ) .    the most extensive sets of measurements of molecular line emission in external galaxies has been done using the j=1 - 0 transitions of co @xcite and hcn @xcite . since the j=1 - 0 transitions of co and hcn are good tracers of the more generally distributed and the denser gas , respectively , but do not provide comprehensive information about the individual physical conditions of the dense , potentially star - forming gas , another molecule must be observed for this purpose .",
    "formaldehyde ( h@xmath2co ) has proven to be a reliable density and kinetic temperature probe in galactic molecular clouds .",
    "existing measurements of the h@xmath2co @xmath0 and @xmath1 emission in a wide variety of galaxies by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have mainly concentrated on measurements of the @xmath0 transition .",
    "one of our goals with the present study was to obtain a uniform set of measurements of both k - doublet transitions with which the physical conditions , specifically the spatial density , in the extragalactic context could be derived . using the unique density selectivity of the k - doublet transitions of h@xmath2co we have measured the spatial density in a sample of galaxies exhibiting starburst phenomena and/or high infrared luminosity . in  [ h2coprobe ] we discuss the specific properties of the h@xmath2co molecule which make it a good probe of spatial density .  [ observations ] presents our observation summary ;  [ results ] our h@xmath2co , oh , h111@xmath8 , and continuum emission measurement results ;  [ analysis ] analyses of our h@xmath2co , oh , and h111@xmath8 measurements , including large velocity gradient ( lvg ) model fits to and dense gas mass calculations based on our h@xmath2co measurements .",
    "formaldehyde ( h@xmath2co ) is a proven tracer of the high density environs of molecular clouds .",
    "it is ubiquitous : h@xmath2co is associated with 80% of the hii regions surveyed by @xcite , and possesses a large number of observationally accessible transitions from centimeter to far - infrared wavelengths . because h@xmath2co is a slightly asymmetric rotor molecule , most rotational energy levels are split by this asymmetry into two energy levels .",
    "therefore , the energy levels must be designated by a total angular momentum quantum number , j , the projection of j along the symmetry axis for a limiting prolate symmetric top , k@xmath9 , and the projection of j along the symmetry axis for a limiting oblate symmetric top , k@xmath10 .",
    "this splitting leads to two basic types of transitions : the high - frequency @xmath11j = 1 , @xmath11k@xmath9 = 0 , @xmath11k@xmath10 = @xmath121 `` p - branch '' transitions and the lower - frequency @xmath11j = 0 , @xmath11k@xmath9 = 0 , @xmath11k@xmath10 = @xmath131 `` q - branch '' transitions , popularly known as the `` k - doublet '' transitions ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the p - branch transitions are only seen in emission in regions where n(@xmath14 ) @xmath15 10@xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "the excitation of the k - doublet transitions , though , is not so simple . for n(@xmath14 ) @xmath18 10@xmath19 @xmath17 , the lower energy states of the @xmath0 through @xmath20 k - doublet transitions become overpopulated due to a collisional selection effect ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this overpopulation cools the j @xmath21 5 k - doublets to excitation temperatures lower than that of the cosmic microwave background , causing them to appear in absorption . for n(@xmath14 ) @xmath15 @xmath22 @xmath17 , this collisional pump is quenched and the j @xmath21 5 k - doublets are then seen in emission over a wide range of kinetic temperatures and abundances ( see figure  [ fig : kdoubtex ] ) .",
    "the measurements reported here were made using the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) green bank telescope ( gbt ) during the period 2006/06/07 - 14 .",
    "single - pointing measurements were obtained of the @xmath0 ( 4.829660 ghz ) and @xmath1 ( 14.488479 ghz ) k - doublet transitions of h@xmath2co , the h111@xmath8 radio recombination line ( rrl ) at 4.744183 ghz , and two of the three ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) hyperfine satellite lines of the rotationally excited @xmath25 state of oh at 4.750656(3 ) and 4.765562(3 )  ghz @xcite toward a sample of 19 infrared - luminous and/or starburst galaxies ( table  [ tab : sources ] ) .",
    "our source sample was chosen to represent both galaxies with measured h@xmath2co emission or absorption ( @xcite , @xcite ) and other galaxies with substantial molecular emission deduced from hcn measurements ( @xcite ) .",
    "the single - beam h@xmath2co @xmath0 , h111@xmath8 , and oh @xmath25 transitions were measured using 4 spectral windows each with 50 mhz of bandwidth sampled by 16384 channels .",
    "all of the 4.8 ghz measurements ( @xmath26 ) utilized the position switching technique with reference position located 30 arcmin west in azimuth from each source position .",
    "the h@xmath2co @xmath1 transition was measured using the dual - beam ( @xmath27 ; beam separation 330@xmath28 in cross - elevation ) receiver over 50 mhz of bandwidth sampled by 16384 channels .",
    "the dual - beam system at 14.5 ghz allowed for both position switching and beam nodding .",
    "both correlator configurations produced a spectral channel width of 3.052 khz , which is approximately 0.2 and 0.08 km  s@xmath29 at 4.8 and 14.5 ghz , respectively .",

    "a single h@xmath2co transition can be used to derive the h@xmath2co column density . to estimate h@xmath2co column densities toward the galaxies that we have only detected in the @xmath0 transition , we assume a spatial density of @xmath162 @xmath17 ( for absorption sources ) or @xmath163 @xmath17 ( for emission sources ) and kinetic temperature of 40 k. our spatial density assumption is based upon our derivations of the spatial density in the five galaxies where both h@xmath2co transitions were measured , while our assumed kinetic temperature is typical of our galaxy sample ( see table  [ tab : sources ] ) . using our measured @xmath0 intensities",

    "as we are clearly measuring densities which are many orders of magnitude larger than the critical density for the h@xmath2co transitions studied in this work , the critical density appears to be a poor indicator of the density probing properties of a molecular transition .",
    "since significant optical depth in a transition can lower the critical density by limiting the radiative contribution to the upper energy level population , the critical density is not actually a lower limit to the density required to excite a molecular transition under many interstellar conditions .",
