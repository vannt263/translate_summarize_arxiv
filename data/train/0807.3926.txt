    "jet detection at d0  is based on three finely segmented liquid - argon and uranium calorimeters , hosted in a central barrel and two end caps , that provide nearly full solid - angle coverage  @xcite .",
    "the calorimeters offer a stable response with good energy resolution . their total depth is more than @xmath1 interaction lengths . in run ii of the fermilab tevatron collider , d0  calorimeters collect charge within a time window of @xmath2 . they are partially compensating , with an electromagnetic response that is ( roughly ) 1.2 to 1.9 times higher than the hadronic response .",
    "the region between the barrel and the end caps contains scintillator - based detectors that supplement the coverage of the main calorimeters .",
    "jet reconstruction in this region is inferior due to the complicated geometry of the detectors and the large amount of passive material ( e.g. cryostat walls ) , but these effects are easily accommodated within the data - driven techniques used in d0 , for example , the jet energy calibration described in this section .",
    "calorimeter readouts are grouped into pseudo - projective towers focused on the nominal interaction point for reconstruction purposes .",
    "the energies deposited in calorimeter towers are then clustered into jets using the run ii iterative seed - based cone - jet algorithm including mid - points  @xcite  with cone radius @xmath3 in rapidity @xmath4 and azimuthal angle @xmath5 .",
    "the measured jet energies ( @xmath6 ) are calibrated to match ( on average ) the energies at particle level ( @xmath7 ) . by `` particle level ''",
    "we refer to produced particles before they interact with material in the detector .",
    "this calibration is usually described in terms of a multiplicative scaling factor known as the jet energy scale ( @xmath8 )  @xcite .",
    "d0  parametrizes the calibrations for data and simulation ( mc ) as @xmath9 where the terms are as follows :    * the offset energy , @xmath10 , is the energy not associated to the hard scatter : noise , pile - up , and multiple collisions . note that beam remnants and multiple parton interactions ( in the same collision ) are not included .",
    "it is calculated based on the energy density measured in data from regions outside jets , as a function of the number of primary vertices ( pvs ) reconstructed in the event ( see fig  [ fig : offset ] ) .",
    "* the response , @xmath11 , is the fraction of particle jet energy deposited in the calorimeter by the particles .",
    "it is measured in three steps .",
    "first the photon energy scale is calibrated with @xmath12 data and with a detector simulation specifically tuned to reproduce electromagnetic showering , which is used to translate between electron and photon energy scales .",
    "then the response in the central region is calibrated with photon+jet events as a function of the jet energy .",
    "finally the response is extrapolated to other regions using dijet events with a central jet .",
    "* the detector showering correction , @xmath13 , accounts for energy flow in and out of the calorimeter jet due to detector effects ( finite calorimeter tower and hadron shower size , magnetic field ) .",
    "detector showering is estimated by fitting energy profile templates to the data .",
    "the templates are derived from the simulation , one describes energy in particles that belong to the jet , and the other the energy in particles that do not belong to the jet . *",
    "@xmath14  represents corrections for biases of the method , which are derived by comparing measured and desired values of the @xmath10  and @xmath11 terms in various mc samples .",
    "offset energy within the jet for different primary vertex multiplicities , as a function of jet pseudorapidity . ]    for central jets , the resulting jes decreases as a function of the jet energy from about 1.8 in data and 1.6 in simulation for @xmath15 jets , to about 1.2 for the most energetic jets observed .",
    "for forward jets the scales are a bit higher , but the structure is similar .",
    "the resulting uncertainties ( shown in fig  [ fig : jeserr ] ) for central jets with transverse momenta ( @xmath16 ) of 30 - 120gevare about 1% .",
    "this unprecedented precision covers most of the jet kinematics required for top quark measurements . in that region , several components have comparable uncertainties ; in other regions the uncertainties on the response are bigger and dominate the total uncertainty .",
    "the jet energy scale benefits top analyses in several ways .",
    "the most direct gain is that the jes puts jets collected at different regions of the detector and with different instantaneous luminosities on an equal footing .",
    "this improves the energy resolution and simplifies the analyses .",
    "another gain is that it puts jets from data and mc on an equal footing .",
    "in fact , for almost all top analyses  @xcite , it is only the relative ( data over mc ) jes that matters , rather than the absolute jes .",
    "for example , top cross section analyses ( e.g. @xcite or  @xcite ) require the jes to calculate the signal selection efficiency , which is taken from the mc .",
    "similarly , top quark mass ( @xmath17 ) measurements  @xcite use the mc s qcd modeling to translate the observed @xmath18  boson   and top quark mass peaks to their nominal ( parton - level ) masses , and it is exactly in that translation that the relative jes is required .",
    "the importance of the jet energy scale in top analyses can be quantified by examining the impact of its uncertainties . though the jes is known to about 1% , the resulting uncertainties in top cross section measurements are about 50% of the total systematic uncertainties .",
    "for @xmath17   measurements they dominate the total systematic uncertainty .",
    "the final jes measurement , for the first @xmath19 of d0  data , is in some sense too precise : the uncertainty is so small that it is not directly applicable within its errors to jets from any but the photon plus jet sample . a detailed example , from the inclusive jet cross section measurement  @xcite , is the dijet energy scale .",
    "since the hadronic response is particularly low ( relative to the electromagnetic response used to calibrate the calorimeter ) at low energies , and jets initiated by gluons have more particles and hence lower energies per particle than jets initiated by quarks , the overall calorimeter response to gluon - initiated jets is about 5% lower than the response to quark jets . at low @xmath16 ,",
    "the dijet sample is dominated by gluon - initiated jets while the photon plus jet sample , on which the basic jes was measured , is dominated by quark - initiated jets .",
    "this leads to a @xmath20 correction of the jes when applying it to low @xmath16  jets in a dijet sample ( see fig  [ fig : dijet ] ) , which is much larger than the uncertainty on the jes itself .",
    "estimated difference in response for jets from photon+jet and qcd dijet sample . ]    when applying the jes to top quark samples , additional complications appear .",
    "the relative jes might differ between light and @xmath0 jets , due to their different particle content ( and spectra ) . for our latest @xmath17  measurement",
    "this is the leading systematic uncertainty since we fit both @xmath17  and an overall jes to the data .",
    "the fitted jes is essentially from the light jets that make up the observed @xmath18  boson  mass peak , but the fitted @xmath17  depends strongly on the energy scale for the jet initiated by the @xmath0 quark from the @xmath21 decay .",
    "another complication is that the jes is defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23  is an unbiased estimator of the corresponding particle - level jet energy .",
    "this definition is rooted in qcd measurements , and implicitly includes a bias appropriate to them : in a steeply falling spectrum a symmetric finite resolution causes a bias as more events migrate into each @xmath6  bin from the heavily populated bin with slightly lower-@xmath6   than from the sparsely populated bin with slightly higher-@xmath6 .",
    "the bias depends on the sample , and also on the resolution .",
    "thus the energy resolution and the sample ( photon plus jet ) are implicit in the jes definition .",
    "the former is particularly problematic for d0  since the simulated jet resolutions are better than those observed in data .",
    "the different resolutions are of course accounted for in analyses , but they also imply a different jes bias in data and mc since the jet resolutions can only be measured ( and calibrated ) after the jes is applied .",
    "this raises the question : is this the best jes definition for top physics ?",
    "after all , the slope and resolution bias is almost irrelevant for top samples due to the fairly flat jet energy spectra .",
    "why should we introduce this complication via the jes ?",
    "an alternative definition of the jes to be considered is : @xmath24 where @xmath25  is an unbiased estimator of the corresponding detector - level jet energy .",
    "such a definition is independent of sample and energy resolution , can easily be applied to data ( using the inverse function ) , and will improve the clarity of our papers : currently a `` @xmath26 '' jet in a d0  top quark sample corresponds on average to about @xmath27 at particle level due to the sample dependent bias discussed above .",
    "the presence of non - interacting particles , such as neutrinos , in an event can be inferred from an imbalance in the transverse components of the total momenta of the observable particles . in practice",
    ", we measure the imbalance observed in the calorimeter and refer to it as the missing transverse energy ( met ) .",
    "cuts on met are used to enrich samples in top events with a leptonically decaying @xmath18  boson .",
    "but due to the finite energy resolutions multijet events can have a sizable fake met and are an important and difficult background in many top analyses .",
    "the met - based background rejection is improved by determining the met resolution for each event based on the detailed resolutions of the objects ( jets , electrons and unclustered energy ) reconstructed in the event .",
    "we then construct a log likelihood inspired discriminating variable , that is the log of the probability that the entire met is a mismeasurement .",
    "the construction also incorporates a `` soft '' limit on high log likelihood values ( see fig  [ fig : metl ] ) .",
    "this met likelihood is a key tool in d0 s top pair cross section measurement in the @xmath28 plus jets channel  @xcite .     predicted and observed number of events as a function of the number of @xmath0 tags , for a typical top pair selection with 4 or more jets  @xcite . ]     predicted and observed number of events as a function of the number of @xmath0 tags , for a typical top pair selection with 4 or more jets  @xcite . ]",
    "the identification of jets containing @xmath0 quarks is primarily used in top analyses to suppress background , as the top signal contains @xmath0 jets , while most backgrounds do not .",
    "an example is shown in fig  [ fig : sample ] .",
    "@xmath0 i d is also used to assign partons to jets , often in conjunction with kinematic information .",
    "this is particularly needed in the fully - hadronic top pair decay channel where 90 jet - parton assignments are possible for the canonical 6 jet events .",
    "the average number of @xmath29 jets in these events is 1 , so that @xmath29-jet rejection is very useful when analyzing this channel .",
    "the typical lifetime of a @xmath30 hadron is @xmath31 , and due to time dilation it can travel a few millimeters before its decay . here",
    "are the four basic @xmath0-tagging algorithms that are used in d0 , the first three are based on the @xmath30 hadron lifetime .    *",
    "the secondary vertex tagger ( svt ) builds up track - based jets , and for each one it selects tracks with high impact parameter and attempts to build secondary vertices ( svs ) from the selected tracks . for each sv",
    "it calculates the decay length significance @xmath32 , where @xmath33  is the visible decay length ( the @xmath34 coordinate of the primary vertex is known to a much lesser accuracy ) , and @xmath35 is its fitted uncertainty .",
    "it then tags calorimeter jets matched within @xmath36 to a track - jet with an sv with @xmath37 above some cut . in",
    "what follows the cut is @xmath38 . *",
    "the counting signed impact parameter tagger ( csip ) is based on the tracks impact parameter ( ip ) significance @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 is a signed quantity , positive when the track s point of closest approach to the pv is in the hemisphere defined around the track s reconstructed momentum with its origin at the pv .",
    "a jet is tagged as a @xmath0 jet if it has at least 2 tracks with @xmath41 , or if it has at least 3 tracks with @xmath42 .",
    "* the jet lifetime probability tagger ( jlip ) translates each track s @xmath40 value into a probability that the track originated at the pv , and then combines those probabilities into a jet - wide probability . * the soft lepton tag ( slt )",
    "is based on @xmath30 hadron decay properties rather than on @xmath30 hadron lifetime .",
    "@xmath30 hadrons often decay into muons ( @xmath43 ) , and since for reconstructed @xmath0 jets @xmath44 the muons are usually collinear with the jet . a jet is assigned an slt if a muon is reconstructed within the jet .",
    "this tagger is very easy to model and yields low systematic uncertainties that are completely different than those that dominate the tracking based taggers .",
    "it also identifies if the jet contained a @xmath0 quark or antiquark , which can be useful  @xcite .    to combine the information from the three tracking tags , we feed their outputs into a neural network ( nn ) trained to discriminate between @xmath0 jets and light jets .",
    "the dominant nn inputs are the decay length significance of the sv , the weighted combination of the tracks ip significance , and the jlip output . at a typical working point ,",
    "the nn tagger tags @xmath45 of the @xmath0 jets , @xmath46 of the @xmath29 jets , and @xmath47 of the light jets .",
    "since the performance of the tagging algorithm is difficult to simulate , it is taken from data  @xcite .",
    "it is split into two parts : taggability , which is the probability that enough tracks were reconstructed ( within @xmath48 from the jet center ) to @xmath0 tag the jet , and a tagging rate ( tr ) , that is an efficiency for @xmath0 and @xmath29 jets and a fake rate for light jets , given that there are enough tracks reconstructed to @xmath0 tag the jet .",
    "the taggability depends strongly on the @xmath34-coordinate of the pv , as the pv may lie outside the fiducial volume of the d0  silicon tracker . since all jets in an event are reconstructed as having the same pv , this results in a large correlation between the jets which must be described .",
    "the heavy flavor trs given that the jet is taggable are measured using two base samples with different @xmath0 jet contents : an inclusive sample of jets that contain a muon ( @xmath49 ) and a subsample of such jets that are back to back in azimuth to a @xmath0-tagged jet ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "two almost uncorrelated @xmath0-tagging algorithms are used : the track based algorithm under study and the slt algorithm which requires a muon within the jet .",
    "the efficiencies are factorized into a function of @xmath16  multiplied by a function of @xmath51 , and for each @xmath16  or @xmath51 bin we have :    * eight event counts : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , * eight variables : @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , where the @xmath66s are efficiencies , and * eight equations , such as @xmath67 .",
    "the equations also contain 4 corrections for possible correlations that are taken from the mc .    for each bin the solution of this equation system",
    "yields the trs for jets that contain muons .",
    "this is done for both data and mc , and the mc is used to extrapolate the tag rates for all jets : @xmath68 similarly , fake rates ( @xmath69 ) are measured in data using various negative tags , for example , an svt tag is considered as negative if the path from the pv to the sv is in a direction opposite the momentum of the tracks in the sv .",
    "mc corrections are then used to derive the fake rates from the negative tag rates .",
    "the trs are derived separately for each one of several working points , for example , many top analysis use the nn output @xmath70 working point .",
    "there are several strategies for using @xmath0-tagging information in top analyses .",
    "the standard strategy is to use the tagging rates for a particular working point .",
    "if only the number of @xmath0 tags in each event ( @xmath71 ) is of interest the probability of having @xmath72 is easily calculated from the trs ( e.g. ref  @xcite ) .",
    "several strategies are used when it is necessary to know which jets are @xmath0 tagged .",
    "one can randomly assign a tag for each jet : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the jet s tagging probability and @xmath75 is a random variable uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 ( e.g. ref  @xcite ) .",
    "one can use all the possible assignments of @xmath76 values ( for example `` @xmath77 @xmath78 and @xmath79 @xmath80 for @xmath81 '' is a possible assignment ) , giving each assignment a weight : @xmath82 ( e.g. ref  @xcite ) .",
    "the latter method yields higher statistical strength , which unfortunately is often hard to calculate due to the complicated correlations between assignments derived from the same mc event . instead of using the trs",
    ", it is also possible to weight the mc so the tagging rates agree with data , which was done in ref  @xcite .",
    "another strategy that is currently being developed is to build a semi - continuous @xmath0 tagger using rate functions ( for mc ) for all working points .",
    "the main difficulty to be resolved is how to account for systematic correlations between the different bins .",
    "an unusual strategy was used to measure the @xmath18  boson  helicity in top decays  @xcite : since the analysis is sensitive only to the kinematic dependencies of the trs , and not to the overall rate , it was conceivable that the known inaccuracies in the simulation of the tag rate will not present a problem , as they have little kinematic dependence . thus , to utilize the full background rejection power of the nn tagger , the highest nn outputs in the event were used as a discriminating variable .",
    "the difference between the simulated and actual distributions was taken from a signal depleted sample and applied to the selected sample to evaluate the resulting systematics .",
    "the analysis proved to be quite insensitive to the missimulation , and the resulting systematic uncertainty is only 10% of the total systematic uncertainties .",
    "a successful top physics program requires well understood jet energy calibration and @xmath0 tagging . in particular",
    ", the detector simulation might be a limiting factor .",
    "the unprecedented accuracy of d0 s jet energy calibration raises sample dependence and detector simulation issues . in this context",
    "it is interesting to compare d0 s and cdf s  @xcite `` jes for top physics '' experience : perhaps a well calibrated parametrized mc is more useful than a full detector simulation ?",
