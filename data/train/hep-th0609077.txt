    "@xcite the authors have considered a field theory in which different soliton solutions of the sine - gordon model are linked in such a way that the integrability is preserved .",

    "the key ingredient to classify integrable defects is to impose certain first order differential relations between the different solutions ( backlund transformation ) .",
    "this introduces certain boundary functions ( bf ) which are specific of each integrable model and leads to the conservation of the total momentum .    here , we analize the structure of the possible boundary terms for various cases .",
