    "diffuse cluster radio sources are found in a few x - ray luminous clusters of galaxies .",
    "they are extended ( @xmath1 mpc ) , have low surface brightnesses , and exhibit steep spectra ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) .",
    "they can not be identified with any one individual galaxy but are associated with the cluster as a whole .",
    "diffuse cluster radio sources are generally separated into two classes : halos and relics .",
    "halos are centred on the x - ray emission ( e.g. coma - c is a proto - type radio halo source ; giovannini et al .",
    "1993 ) whereas relics are peripheral and exhibit stronger polarisation than halos ( e.g. a3667 has a large relic ; rttgering et al .",
    "1997 ) . in this paper",
    ", we will concentrate on halo sources .    until recently , systematic surveys for radio halo sources found few examples , with the total number of known halos being @xmath4 ( feretti & giovannini 1996 ) .",
    "they are thus considered to be rare , and owing to their small number remain a poorly understood class of radio sources even though the first example , coma - c , was discovered over 20 years ago .",
    "the spectra suggest that halo radio emission arises predominantly by the synchrotron process .",
    "however , the formation of radio halos remains a puzzle : why do they occur in some clusters and not in others , and what is the origin of the magnetic field and relativistic particles ?    a number of models have been proposed to explain the formation of radio halos ( e.g. jaffe 1977 ; dennison 1980 ; roland 1981 ) .",
    "most of these early models suggest that ultra - relativistic electrons originate either as relativistic electrons from cluster radio sources re - accelerated by in - situ fermi processes or turbulent galactic wakes , or as secondary electrons produced by the interaction between relativistic protons ( again from cluster radio galaxies ) and thermal protons .",
    "however , the energetics involved are problematic and the models could not always fit the observations ( e.g. , see review by bhringer 1995 ) .",
    "harris et al .",
    "( 1980 ) first suggested that radio halos are formed in cluster mergers where the merging process creates the shocks and turbulence necessary for the magnetic field amplification and high energy particle acceleration .",
    "more recently , tribble ( 1993 ) showed that the energetics involved in a merger are more than enough to power a radio halo .",
    "the halos thus produced are expected to be transient since the relativistic electrons lose energy on time scales of @xmath5yrs and the time interval between mergers is of order @xmath6yrs .",
    "this argument was used to explain why radio halos are rare .    in this paper",
    ", we will describe the properties of the radio halo found in one of the hottest known clusters 1e0657@xmath056 , and suggest a new model for the origin of cluster halos based on the radio and x - ray properties of all 10 confirmed halos .",
    " [ s2 ] describes the multi - wavelength properties of cluster 1e0657@xmath056 ;  [ s3 ] describes the radio observations ;  [ s4 ] discusses the radio properties of the halo found in 1e0657@xmath056 ; and  [ s5 ] discusses the origin of radio halos . throughout the paper we will use @xmath7 kms@xmath8mpc@xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the cluster 1e0657@xmath056 was originally found in the einstein slew survey ( tucker et al .",
    "1995 ) , and subsequent optical observations confirmed it to be a rich cluster at @xmath11 with a velocity dispersion of @xmath12 kms@xmath8 ( tucker et al .",
    "it has high x - ray luminosity and was shown to be one of the hottest known clusters by tucker et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "the cluster was observed for 25ksec by asca in 1996 may and with the rosat high - resolution imager ( hri ) in 1995 for 58 ksec ( tucker et al .",
    "tucker et al . (",
    "1998 ) analysed the asca gas scintillation imaging spectrometers ( gis ) and solid - state imaging spectrometers ( sis ) data and found the cluster to have a best fit temperature of @xmath13kev and a bolometric luminosity of @xmath14 erg s@xmath8 .",
    "however , yaqoob ( 1999 ) challenged these results by re - analysing the asca gis / sis data and arrived at a temperature of @xmath15kev , abundance @xmath16 solar , and a neutral hydrogen absorption column density @xmath17@xmath18 , much higher than the galactic value .",
    "yaqoob found that the only way to reproduce the high temperature deduced by tucker et al .",
    "( 1998 ) was to fix the neutral hydrogen column density to the galactic value , and concluded that fixing the absorption column density in such a way leads to an artificially high temperature .",
    "since then , some rosat position - sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) data have become publicly available . since it is known that asca sis data below 1 kev suffer from inaccurate calibration , we re - estimate the cluster temperature by fitting to the combined asca gis and rosat pspc data .",
    "the gis and pspc data complement each other : the gis is more sensitive to the cluster temperature while the pspc is more sensitive to the soft x - ray absorption .",
    "we followed the standard asca procedure for screening the gis2 and gis3 data as set out in _ the abc guide to asca data reduction_. the spectra were extracted from a circular region of radius @xmath19 centred on the cluster , after the subtraction of a local background , extracted from the same frame in areas with no obvious emission .",
    "the spectra were regrouped to a minimum of 50 counts per bin .",
    "the xspec package ( arnaud 1996 ) was used to fit the gis spectra between 0.8 and 10kev by a raymond - smith spectrum ( raymond & smith 1977 ) , with fractional solar relative abundances from the table of feldman ( 1992 ) and photoelectric absorption ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ) .",
    "temperature , abundance @xmath20 , absorption ( parametrised by @xmath21 ) , and the normalisation were taken as free parameters .",
    "the best fit was @xmath22kev , @xmath23@xmath18 , and @xmath24 with a reduced @xmath25 .",
    "the errors correspond to 90% confidence limit .",
    "it is clear that @xmath26 is poorly constrained by the gis data alone , as expected from the absence of low - energy data .",
    "we retrieved from the rosat archive a 4.7ksec - exposure pspc event file observed in 1997 february .",
    "a spectrum of the x - ray emission from the cluster gas was extracted from the central @xmath27 radius after the subtraction of discrete sources and background contributions .",
    "the background was estimated from an annulus between radii of 810@xmath28 centred on the cluster . only the spectrum within the energy range between 0.1 and 2.0kev",
    "was used for model fitting .",
    "a combined fit of a raymond - smith spectrum to the gis and pspc spectra gave the best fit as follows : @xmath29kev , @xmath30@xmath18 , @xmath31 ( see fig .  [ ascasp ] ) with a reduced @xmath25 .",
    "a direct radio - astronomical measure of the galactic neutral hydrogen column density towards 1e0657@xmath056 gives @xmath32@xmath18 ( e.  m.  arnal , private communication ) ; dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) gives a value of @xmath33@xmath18 .",
    "recently we have obtained a high resolution ( @xmath34 beam ) measurement of the galactic neutral hydrogen column density towards 1e0657@xmath056 using the parkes telescope , giving a @xmath35@xmath18 ( c. brns , private communication ) which is very close to the x - ray fitted value .",
    "thus it appears that the temperature is lower than that estimated in tucker et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , although 1e0657@xmath056 is still one of the hottest known clusters . on the other hand , our best fit temperature is higher than that deduced by yaqoob ( 1999 ) and our best fit @xmath21 is much closer to the galactic value than that given by yaqoob .",
    "the difference is unlikely to be caused by different background subtraction techniques , since yaqoob tried a wide range of background subtraction methods and found that the systematic differences between the various techniques are less than the statistical errors .",
    "we tested our result by fixing the @xmath21 and abundance @xmath20 at the values given by yaqoob , and found a best fit @xmath36kev , consistent with his result but with a high reduced @xmath37 of 1.56/d.o.f .. figure  [ ascasp2 ] shows that yaqoob s fit ( to the asca data alone ) is inconsistent with the pspc data which extend to lower energies ( @xmath38kev ) than the sis ( @xmath39kev ) , and are therefore more sensitive to soft x - ray absorption .",
    "the hri image of the cluster shows two clearly separated clumps ( see figure  [ hrir ] ) .",
    "andreani et al .",
    "( 1999 ) analysed the spatial distribution of the x - ray emission using the hri data and found that the x - ray surface brightness can be fitted with two spherically symmetric @xmath40-models ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 ) with gas density distributions given by @xmath41^{-3\\beta/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xmath45 for the eastern and western clumps respectively .",
    "the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sz effect ) is the distortion of the blackbody spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) due to inverse compton scattering of cmb photons by free electrons in a plasma such as an intracluster medium ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1972 ) .",
    "the cluster 1e0657 - 56 was selected as a candidate for the detection of the sz effect in the 199495 swedish eso submillimeter telescope ( sest ) campaign ( andreani et al .",
    "the sest observations show a @xmath46 detection of the sz effect at 1.2 mm ( @xmath47 150ghz ) and a @xmath48 detection at 2 mm ( @xmath47 250ghz ) ( andreani et al .",

    "shortly after the sest observations , we obtained data with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) at 8.8 ghz to confirm the sest detection of the sz effect .",
    "the atca observations were conducted using the special 210-m array which proved to be an excellent configuration for detecting low surface brightness diffuse emissions .",
    "the 4.9 and 8.8ghz observations show complex radio source structures , including at least two extended , diffuse sources and an unusual strongly polarised ( @xmath51 at 8.8ghz ) steep spectrum ( @xmath52 ) source ( liang et al . , 2000 , in preparation ) .",
    "the diffuse radio sources make the detection of the sz effect difficult since the sz effect is also extended and the straightforward point - source subtraction technique fails .",
    "however , since the radio sources in the cluster are interesting in their own right , we obtained further radio data .",
    "it was these later observations that led to the detection of a radio halo source .",
    "the atca has five 22-m antennas on a 3-km east - west rail - track and a sixth antenna 3 km from the western end of the track , giving baselines up to 6 km .",
    "simultaneous observations were made in two frequency bands each of bandwidth 128mhz divided into 32 frequency channels .",
    "the cluster 1e0657@xmath056 was observed at 1.3 , 2.4 , 4.9 , 5.9 , and 8.8ghz in several antenna configurations , so that similar uv coverage was obtained at all frequencies .",

    "the telescope operates at 843  mhz , with a detection bandwidth of 3.25  mhz , and forms a comb of 64 real - time fan beams spaced by @xmath55 , which are interlaced to a spacing of @xmath56 .",

    "the difficulty is two - fold : firstly , we need to define the angular size of the emission , which depends on the noise level in the image ; and secondly , we need to know if we have sampled a large enough angular scale ( i.e. short enough baselines ) to include all the flux density . in the following paragraphs",
    "we describe two independent methods of estimating the integrated flux density as a function of the area of integration .",
    "first , we make a low resolution image ( @xmath64 beam ) using the uv data - set that has the discrete sources already subtracted , but taking only the short - baseline data ( @xmath65 ) .",

    "we now examine an alternative method of estimating the total halo flux density which also serves as a check on the method above .",

    "this power is likely to be a lower limit since there are negative contours around the halo in the 1.3ghz image ( fig .",
    "[ allfreq]b ) , which we interpret as evidence of missing short spacings .",

    "it is thus difficult to separate the sz effect from the halo emission using the radio data alone .",

    ", we need to correct for the sz effect at each frequency .",
    "we simulate the sz effect at 4.9 to 8.8ghz , using the x - ray data and the sest detection at 2 mm .",
    "andreani et al . ( 1999 ) found that the sz effect detected at 2 mm was consistent with a model of the x - ray surface brightness expressed by two @xmath40-models ( corresponding to the two x - ray clumps ) assuming an isothermal gas temperature of @xmath72kev , if @xmath73kms@xmath8mpc@xmath8 .",
    "for consistency with the sest results , we use this gas temperature only for these calculations ; in the rest of the paper , we use the newly - derived gas temperature given in  [ s : xray ] .",

    "we can obtain the flux density of the extended source ( a ) from images like that of fig  [ 21cm]b at each frequency and subtract them from the total integrated flux .",
    "the resulting spectral index of region ` 2 ' is @xmath76 between 1.3 and 4.9ghz , and @xmath77 between 2.4 and 8.8ghz , indicating no significant steepening of the spectral index between 1.3 and 8.8ghz .",

    "we estimate the minimum pressure by following the procedure set out in pacholczyk ( 1970 ) , assuming a constant spectral index of @xmath77 between the cutoff frequencies of 10mhz and 100ghz , a emission volume filling factor @xmath89 of 1 and a ratio @xmath90 between the energy in relativistic protons and electrons of 1 .",
    "the minimum pressure of the radio plasma is a factor @xmath91 smaller than the thermal pressure . since @xmath92 , we need @xmath93 for @xmath94 to match the thermal pressure which seems unlikely .",
    "similar results have been found in other radio halos ( e.g. feretti et al .",
    "1997 ) . since the radio plasma interpenetrates the thermal gas , the radio and the thermal plasma",
    "each contributes a partial pressure to the total plasma pressure which appears to be dominated by the thermal pressure .",

    "the main concentration of galaxies is displaced from the dominant ( eastern ) peak of the x - ray emission ( see fig .  [ hrir]c ) .",
    "both the x - ray gas and the galaxy distribution suggest that the cluster is undergoing a merging process .",
    "since the x - ray clumps are well separated , the merger appears to be in a relatively early stage . since galaxies are more or less collisionless , but gas is collisional , a merger between two subclusters tends to allow the galaxies to stream past one another , while the gas tends to coalesce quickly .",
    "[ hrir]c shows that the galaxy clumps in 1e0657@xmath056 are further apart than the gas clumps , indicating that the galaxies have crossed each other at least once .",
    "the projected merging axis appears to be close to the ra - direction .",
    "shocks produced during the merger are a plausible source for the energy of the relativistic electrons responsible for the radio halo emission .",
    "a number of surveys have been conducted to search for radio halos .",
    "the earliest were conducted at green bank at 610 mhz ( jaffe & rudnick 1979 ) , at metre wavelengths 50120 mhz ( cane _ et al .",
    "_ 1981 ) and at arecibo at 430 mhz ( hanisch 1982 ) , but yielded few examples .",
    "most of the surveys selected either nearby abell clusters ( hanisch 1982 ) , or clusters with known x - ray emission or radio sources .",
    "more recently , lacy _ et al . _",
    "( 1993 ) imaged a sample of radio sources from the 8c 38mhz survey ( within @xmath98 of the north ecliptic cap ) using the cambridge low frequency synthesis telescope at 151 mhz but did not find any new halo sources .",
    "recent x - ray selected surveys of halos as well as observations aimed at detecting the sz effect have found many more halo candidates suggesting that halos may not be as rare as they were once thought to be .",
    "moffet and birkinshaw ( 1989 ) first suggested that there may be a correlation between the presence of an sz effect and a radio halo source , since the only three clusters a2218 , a665 , and cl0016 + 16 which had an sz effect detected at the time also had extended diffuse radio emission .",
    "one of the strongest radio halos was found in a2163 in an attempt to detect the sz effect ( herbig & birkinshaw 1994 ) . among the seven clusters observed at the atca for the sz effect ,",
    "two show clear evidence of a radio halo ( a2163 , 1e0657@xmath056 ) , while another three show faint extended emission which may be either the result of the blending of discrete radio sources or a faint halo ( liang 1995 ) .",
    "it is perhaps not surprising that searches for the sz effect have been good at finding halo sources : the sz effect is also cluster - wide , thus diffuse and extended like the halo sources .",
    "any observation designed to search for the sz effect will optimise the brightness sensitivity and thus favour the detection of halos .",
    "if , in addition , there is a physical mechanism that associates hot , luminous , x - ray emitting atmospheres and radio halos , searches for sz effects which target such clusters would be expected to find radio halos frequently .",

    "they noticed a significant increase in the percentage of diffuse radio sources in high luminosity clusters compared with low luminosity clusters : 2744% in clusters with l@xmath99 erg / s as compared with 6 - 9% for l@xmath100 erg / s .",
    "we conclude that radio halos are not intrinsically rare , and appeared to be rare from the results of early surveys partly because of the difficulty of detecting such low surface brightness objects and partly because of the selection criteria .      while giovannini et al .",
    "( 1999a ) found more halos in high than low x - ray luminosity clusters , they did not find a correlation between their radio power and the cluster x - ray luminosity .",
    "here we plot the rest frame 1.4ghz radio power ( @xmath101 ) against the cluster x - ray luminosity ( @xmath102 ) for only well - confirmed radio halos ( not relic sources ) using the best radio data available for each halo .",
    "[ haloll ] shows that there is a correlation between radio and x - ray luminosities for @xmath103ergss@xmath8 clusters contrary to giovannini et al .",
    "( 1999a ) where they plotted all candidate halos using the radio power obtained from the nvss for each halo . instead of plotting radio power against x - ray luminosity",
    ", we examine the relationship between halo radio power and cluster x - ray temperature .",
    "[ halopt ] shows the 1.4 ghz integrated radio power of cluster halos plotted against the cluster temperature , demonstrating a steep correlation .",
    "since only well - confirmed radio halos are plotted , the sample of clusters shown is by no means complete .",
    "the apparent rareness of halos can be explained by the steepness of the relationship shown in fig .",
    "[ halopt ] : only clusters with a high x - ray temperature at moderate redshifts are easily detectable .",
    "the surface brightness of halos decreases with increasing redshift at least as fast as @xmath104 when taking account of the k - correction , thus the halo surface brightness rapidly diminishes with increasing redshift .",
    "on the other hand , halos at low redshift are also difficult to detect since they tend to be resolved out in simple interferometric maps ( or single dish observations without a large beam - throw ) .    in the 3 well - imaged cluster halos ( coma , a2163 & 1e0657@xmath056 )",
    ", the extent and shape of the radio halo follows closely that of the cluster x - ray emission ( fig .",
    "[ hrir ] ; deiss et al .",
    "1997 ; herbig & birkinshaw in preparation ) . both the correlation shown in fig .",
    "[ haloll ]  &  [ halopt ] and the similarities between the radio and x - ray morphology indicate a direct connection between the thermal particles and the relativistic electrons responsible for the radio emission .",
    "we favour a model for radio halos where thermal electrons in the icm provide the seed particles for acceleration to the ultra - relativistic energies necessary for synchrotron radiation ( liang 1999 , brunetti et al .",
    "1999 & schlickeiser et al .",
    "this differs from the early theories ( e.g. jaffe 1977 ) where the seed electrons diffused out of radio galaxies . in the past , the possibility of accelerating thermal electrons to relativistic energies has been dismissed , usually with little justification .",
    "we will examine this issue by looking at the arguments put forward against the possibility of accelerating thermal electrons to relativistic energies .",
    "one of the simple arguments was that such a process would be present in every cluster and thus fail to explain the perceived rarity of halos ( giovannini et al . 1993 ) .",
    "as discussed earlier , such an argument does not necessarily hold : the strength of halos appears to be strongly related to the temperature of the thermal gas , and halos may be in every cluster and be detectable or not according to their brightness .",
    "since high temperature clusters are relatively uncommon , so are powerful halos , but high - temperature clusters are likely to contain halos .",
    "a second argument against the `` thermal pool '' origin of the ultra - relativistic electrons was that stochastic processes such as alfvn , turbulent and shock acceleration are only efficient in accelerating electrons that are already mildly relativistic ( e.g. eilek & hughes 1991 and references therein ) .",
    "this means that either the seed electrons are mildly relativistic already , or an injection process is necessary to create a substantial suprathermal tail in the electron energy distribution . to circumvent the injection process ( not yet understood ) ,",
    "it is attractive to invoke models that use the already - relativistic electrons from radio galaxies as seed particles to be re - accelerated .",
    "however , observationally , it has also been shown that while halo candidates were found in nearly 30% of the high x - ray luminosity clusters in a survey for radio halo sources , none was found in the 11 clusters selected by the existence of at least one tailed radio source within 0.1 abell radius ( giovannini et al .",
    "this is further evidence that the relativistic electrons are more likely to have originated from the thermal pool of electrons than the radio galaxies : the appearance of halos is more closely linked to thermal x - ray emission than the presence of tailed radio galaxies .",
    "a closer examination of the argument for an injection process show that it may not always be necessary in a cluster environment . according to eilek & hughes ( 1991 ) ,",
    "cyclotron resonance is responsible for the acceleration of electrons by alfvn waves , and higher energy particles resonate with lower frequency waves .",
    "since alfvn waves have frequencies less than the ion gyrofrequency ( @xmath105 ) , electrons need a minimum energy to be accelerated by alfvn waves .",
    "this threshold energy can be calculated by substituting the ion gyrofrequency @xmath106 and the dispersion relation into the equation for cyclotron resonance : @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the wave frequency , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the components of the wave - number and particle velocity parallel to the magnetic field , and @xmath111 is the relativistic electron gyrofrequency . in the low - amplitude limit",
    "the waves are non - compressive , and the dispersion relation is given by ( krall & trivelpiece 1973 ) @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the alfvn speed . hence the minimum energy or lorentz factor required for an electron to be accelerated by alfven waves is given by @xmath114 where @xmath115 .",
    "this threshold electron energy is already mildly relativistic ( @xmath116kev ) in the limit of @xmath117 , i.e. @xmath118@xmath45 .",
    "however , in a high density environment , @xmath119 is close to one and thermal electrons can be accelerated by alfvn waves .",
    "the environments of radio galaxies , including clusters , were considered to be of low density since the magnetic field strength @xmath120 was thought to be a few @xmath121 g , which means the density threshold is higher than the densities of most clusters .",
    "recent hard x - ray results from beppo - sax and rossi - rxte for coma and other clusters have shown the magnetic field to be @xmath122 g if the excess hard x - ray emission is due to inverse compton scattering of relativistic electrons by the cmb ( e.g. fusco - femiano et al .",
    "1999 ; rephaeli et al .",
    "1999 ; valinia et al .",
    "thus the density threshold is now @xmath123@xmath45 , which makes most parts of clusters high density environments .",
    "for example , in the centres of clusters where @xmath124 , the minimum energy required is just a few kev , and in the outer parts of a cluster where @xmath125 the minimum energy is still just a few tens of kev . electrons with energies of a few tens of kev",
    "are readily available in intracluster plasma of hot clusters .",
    "therefore , it is possible to accelerate thermal electrons in clusters through resonance with alfvn waves .",
    "further , dogiel ( 1999 ) has shown that it is possible to produce a substantial suprathermal tail in the electron energy distribution through second order fermi acceleration in cluster environments , so that additional seed electrons are naturally present in clusters without involving injection from radio galaxies .",
    "on the one hand , the higher the x - ray luminosity of a cluster , the higher the density of thermal electrons ; and on the other hand , the higher the x - ray temperature of a cluster , the higher the fraction of high energy electrons . these two effects multiply to increase the number of electrons above a threshold energy for efficient acceleration processes .    both merging activity and",
    "the electron temperature may be responsible for the production of radio halos .",
    "a possible scenario would be that the initial merging activity provides the energy for accelerating electrons from the suprathermal tail of the energy distribution ( where the hotter clusters have more power ) to ultra - relativistic energies .",
    "since cluster magnetic field strengths are less than @xmath126@xmath121 g , the dominant energy loss mechanism for relativisitic electrons is inverse compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "thus the typical lifetime of an electron that emits at 1.4ghz is @xmath127yr . if we assume a magnetic field of @xmath128 g , then the lifetime of an electron that emits at 1.4ghz in 1e0657@xmath056 is @xmath129yr .",
    "after the shocks have disappeared , radio halos like that of 1e0657@xmath056 may be maintained by in - situ electron acceleration in the residual turbulence . in the case of 1e0657@xmath056",
    ", we found ( fig .",
    "[ hrir ] ) that the radio halo emission is enhanced at the peak of the x - ray emission as well as that of the galaxy distribution .",
    "the enhancement of radio emission at the peak of the x - ray emission is naturally explained by our model where we expect the highest density of relativistic electrons at the density peak of the thermal electrons .",
    "we also expect that the galaxies streaming through the hot intracluster gas would maintain local turbulence and hence inject energy into the particles , producing enhanced radio emissions at the galaxy concentrations .",
    "deiss & just ( 1996 ) found through their calculations that it is possible to have turbulent velocities of several hundred kms@xmath8 , which could considerably enhance the stochastic acceleration rates .",
    "cooling flow clusters are thought to be relaxed and devoid of merging activity .",
    "most of the clusters shown in fig .",
    "[ halopt ] are non - cooling flow clusters .",
    "this does not imply that mergers are the _ critical _ element in radio halo formation , since selection effects act to remove clusters from the sample in fig .",
    "[ halopt ] : cooling flow clusters are more likely to have significant central radio sources than non - cooling flow clusters ( e.g. peres et al .",
    "1998 ) . to our knowledge , no cluster with a strong cooling flow has been observed with sufficient dynamic range and surface brightness sensitivity to test whether or not it follows the @xmath130 trend shown in fig .",
    "[ halopt ] . to illustrate the need for proper observations with high brightness sensitivities , we give as an example , rxj1347 - 11 , a strong cooling flow with the high gas temperature of @xmath131kev ( allen & fabian 1998 ) which has been observed by the nvss with no obvious detection .",
    "however , the nvss does not have enough brightness sensitivity to detect , in rxj1347 - 11 , a halo similar to that in 1e0657@xmath056 because of the high redshift ( @xmath132 ) of the cluster ( expected signal of @xmath133mjy per @xmath134 beam ) and the high noise levels in the nvss image ( @xmath135mjy per @xmath134 beam ) .",
    "we have found a powerful radio halo in the cluster 1e0657@xmath056 . at a rest frame 1.4ghz radio power of @xmath69whz@xmath8 , it is one of the most powerful radio halo sources .",
    "it has a steep spectral index of @xmath136 typical of known halos .",
    "the brightness distributions of the radio halo and x - rays from the cluster gas are remarkably similar , suggesting a direct relationship between the ultra - relativistic electrons responsible for the synchrotron emission and the thermal intracluster gas . as further evidence for the radio / x - ray connection ,",
    "we have found a steep correlation between the radio power of the halo and the x - ray temperature of the intracluster gas ( @xmath130 ) from the 10 confirmed cluster radio halos .",
    "we favour an explanation for the origin of radio halo sources , where the high energy tail of the thermal electron distribution is boosted to ultra - relativistic energies , thus providing a natural link between the halo radio power and x - ray gas temperature .",
    "detailed calculations for such a model will be given in a future paper . finally , it is important for our understanding of the origin of radio halo sources to establish the robustness of the @xmath130 correlation by observing a temperature selected sample of clusters , and to test the mechanism by searching for halos in clusters with strong cooling flows but high temperature .",
    "in addition , we have re - analysed the x - ray spectroscopic data using both asca gis and rosat pspc data for 1e0657@xmath056 and found the best fit temperature to be @xmath29kev consistent with it being one of the hottest known clusters , as claimed by tucker et al .",
    "the use of the pspc data enabled us to determine the soft x - ray absorption to a better accuracy than previous results using asca data alone .",
    "we found the best fit neutral hydrogen column density to be consistent with the galactic value given by radio - astronomical surveys , contrary to the much higher column density claimed by yaqoob ( 1999 ) using asca data alone .",
    "we are grateful to sarah maddison for help with the atca observations ; emilio falco , massimo ramella and wallace tucker for providing the ntt image prior to publication ; christian brns and lister staveley - smith for taking a h i measurement with parkes radio telescope towards the cluster ; and e. m. arnal for providing 21 cm measurements of the neutral hydrogen column density from the iar high sensitivity h i survey . h.l . would like to thank ron ekers for encouragement and helpful discussions , the atnf for hospitality .",
