    "the study of the infrared limit of qcd is of central importance for the comprehension of the mechanisms of quark and gluon confinement and of chiral - symmetry breaking . in landau gauge ,",
    "the gribov - zwanziger@xcite and the kugo - ojima@xcite confinement scenarios predict , at small momenta , an enhanced ghost propagator and a suppression of the gluon propagator .",
    "the strong infrared divergence for the ghost propagator corresponds to a long - range interaction in real space , which may be related to quark confinement .",
    "the suppression of the gluon propagator , which should vanish at zero momentum , implies ( maximal ) violation of reflection positivity which may be viewed as an indication of gluon confinement .",
    "analytic studies of gluon and ghost propagators using schwinger - dyson equations ( sde ) seem to agree with the above scenarios.@xcite in particular , they predict for the gluon and for the ghost propagators an infrared exponent that is independent of the gauge group @xmath2 .    the landau - gauge gluon propagator @xmath3 and ghost propagator @xmath4 have been studied by several groups in quenched qcd [ i.e.  pure @xmath1 yang - mills theory ] , in pure @xmath0 yang - mills theory ( in 2 , 3 and 4 space - time dimensions ) and in full qcd.@xcite in all cases the ghost propagator is enhanced when compared to the tree - level behavior @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "lattice studies suggest a finite nonzero infrared gluon propagator , in contradiction with the infrared schwinger - dyson solution .",
    "one should note that finite - size effects are large in the gluon case , as is suggested by investigation of sde on a 4-torus@xcite , and difficult to evaluate .",
    "nevertheless , violation of reflection positivity is confirmed by several numerical studies in 3d and in 4d , for the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 gauge groups.@xcite    when comparing gluon and ghost propagators from sde studies to numerical results , the agreement is usually at the qualitative level . moreover , while analytic studies using schwinger - dyson equations predict the same infrared exponents for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 gauge groups , lattice simulations usually assume that the two cases are different , although their qualitative infrared features may be the same . in this paper",
    ", we carry out a comparative study of lattice landau gauge propagators for these two gauge groups .",
    "our data were especially produced by considering equivalent lattice parameters in order to allow a careful comparison of the two cases .",
    "we consider four different sets of lattice parameters , with the same lattice size @xmath6 and the same physical lattice spacing @xmath7 for the two gauge groups . in particular , in the @xmath1 case we used @xmath8 at @xmath9 , @xmath10 at @xmath11 , @xmath12 at @xmath13 and @xmath12 at @xmath9 .",
    "for these cases the lattice spacing was taken from ref .  .",
    "the corresponding @xmath14 values for @xmath0 were computed using the asymptotic scaling analysis discussed in ref .  , yielding @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in the first three cases the physical lattice volume @xmath17 is approximately the same , i.e.  @xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "the fourth case corresponds to a significantly larger physical volume , i.e.   @xmath20 @xmath19 .",
    "the gluon propagator @xmath21 and the ghost propagator @xmath22 were evaluated as a function of the lattice momentum @xmath23 , using 50 configurations for all four cases . in order to compare the propagators from the different simulations ,",
    "the propagators were renormalized to their tree - level value @xmath24 , using @xmath25 gev as a renormalization point .",
    "details of the simulations can be found in ref .  .",
    "in what concerns finite - volume and finite - lattice - spacing effects , we find a slight dependence on the type of momenta [ @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 or @xmath29 where the renormalization is performed .",
    "[ finiteffects ] illustrates the effects of choosing different renormalization constants for the gluon propagator . from now on",
    ", we will consider only the data computed using renormalization constants for momenta @xmath26 .    in fig .",
    "[ ratiosglue ] we show the ratios of the renormalized @xmath1 over @xmath0 propagators for various lattice setups .",
    "the data show that the two cases have very similar finite - size and discretization effects",
    ". moreover , @xmath0 and @xmath1 propagators are essentially equal , with slight differences in the low - momenta region ( especially for the gluon propagator ) .",
    "thus , our study supports the prediction from the schwinger - dyson equations that the propagators are the same for all @xmath2 groups in the nonperturbative region .",
    "clearly , further studies are required before drawing conclusions about the comparison between @xmath0 and @xmath1 propagators in the deep - infrared region , where the gluon propagator may show a turnover and a suppression , as predicted in the gribov - zwanziger scenario .",
