    "the advantage of introducing the jacobi function @xmath180 is that it converges well for large @xmath181 and we are also able to obtain convenient well - convergent formulas for the small - x region by applying the transformation ( eq.([theta2 ] ) ) from which the coulomb singular part at @xmath182 can be rigorously extracted .",
    "thus , @xmath183 obtained in eq.([eq1 ] ) can be separated into a large @xmath184 part and a small @xmath184 part given by @xmath185 where      and @xmath187 - \\delta_{i,0}\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{n\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2 a_1    a_2}\\sum_{j}\\int_{0}^{y_0}dy\\,y^{-3/2}f(y)e^{-\\frac{q^2}{4y } }    \\left(\\prod_{\\alpha = x , y } \\theta\\left     [ -i\\frac{2\\rho_{j}^{\\alpha}y+iq_{\\alpha } }    { 2a_{\\alpha}y};\\frac{\\pi}{y{a_{\\alpha}}^2 }    \\right]-1 + 1\\right)\\nonumber\\\\   & & -\\frac{n}{2\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\int_{0}^{y_0 } dy   \\,y^{-1/2}f(y ) \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{n\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2 a_1    a_2}\\sum_{j}\\int_{0}^{y_0}dy\\,y^{-3/2}f(y )    e^{-\\frac{q^2}{4y } } \\left(\\prod_{\\alpha = x , y }     \\theta\\left [   -i\\frac{2\\rho_{j}^{\\alpha}y+iq_{\\alpha } }     { 2a_{\\alpha}y};\\frac{\\pi}{y{a_{\\alpha}}^2}\\right ] -1\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{n_l n\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2 a_1    a_2}\\int_{y_0}^{\\infty}dy\\,y^{-3/2}f(y )    e^{-\\frac{q^2}{4y } } -\\frac{n}{2\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\int_{0}^{y_0 }     dy\\,y^{-1/2}f(y)+e_{ee}^{hom}(q)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath188 is the number of sublattices ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "the results of the calculation are independent of the value of @xmath190 ; nevertheless , we choose it such that the sums @xmath66 converge fast , and we have @xmath191 in order to complete the calculation of @xmath55 , we need to discuss the form of @xmath14 . in their article",

    "we can see that the expression of @xmath55 is dependent on the parameter @xmath198 . since this is a constant contribution , we set @xmath200 and focus on the part which depends only on the geometry of the lattice and on its thickness .    99 t. ando , a. b. fowler , f. stern , rev .",
