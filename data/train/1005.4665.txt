    "ever since _ uhuru _ @xcite , x - ray astronomy missions have had a tradition of publishing catalogs of detected x - ray sources , and these catalogs have provided the fundamental datasets used by numerous studies aimed at characterizing the properties of the x - ray sky . while source catalogs are the primary data products from x - ray sky surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the _ einstein _",
    "ipc catalog @xcite demonstrated the utility of catalogs of _ serendipitous _ sources identified in the fields of _ pointed - observation _ x - ray missions .",
    "more recent serendipitous source catalogs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have further expanded the list of sources with x - ray data available for further analysis by the astronomical community .",
    "source catalogs typically include a uniform reduction of the mission data .",
    "this provides a significant advantage for the general scientific community because it removes the need for end - users , who may be unfamiliar with the complexities of the particular mission and its instruments , to perform detailed reductions for each observation and detected source .    when compared to all previous and current x - ray missions , the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) breaks the resolution barrier with a sub - arcsecond on - axis point spread function ( psf )",
    ". launched in 1999 , _ chandra _ continues to provide a unique high spatial resolution view of the x - ray sky in the energy range from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , over a @xmath6@xmath7 square arcminute field of view .",
    "the combination of excellent spatial resolution , a reasonable field of view , and low instrumental background translate into a high detectable - source density , with low confusion and good astrometry .",
    "_ chandra _ includes two instruments that record images of the x - ray sky .",
    "the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) instrument incorporates ten @xmath8 pixel ccd detectors ( any six of which can be active at one time ) with an effective pixel size of @xmath9 on the sky , an energy resolution of order @xmath10 at the al - k edge ( @xmath11 ) , and a typical time resolution of @xmath12 . the high resolution camera ( hrc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) instrument consists of a pair of large format micro - channel plate detectors with a pixel size @xmath13 on the sky and a time resolution of @xmath14 , but with minimal energy resolution .",
    "the wealth of information that can be extracted from identified serendipitous sources included in _",
    "observations is a powerful and valuable resource for astronomy .",
    "the aim of the ( csc ) is to disseminate this wealth of information by characterizing the x - ray sky as seen by _",
    "chandra_. while numerous other catalogs of x - ray sources detected by _",
    "chandra _ may be found in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the region of the sky or set of observations that comprise these catalogs is restricted , and they are typically aimed at maximizing specific scientific goals . in contrast , the csc is intended to be an all - inclusive , uniformly processed dataset that can be utilized to address a wide range of scientific questions .",
    "the csc is intended ultimately to comprise a definitive catalog of x - ray sources detected by _",
    "chandra _ , and is being made available to the astronomical community in a series of increments with increasing capability over the next several years .",
    "the first release of the csc was published in 2009 march .",
    "this release includes information about 135,914 source detections , corresponding to 94,676 distinct x - ray sources on the sky , extracted from a _ subset _ of public imaging observations obtained using the acis instrument during the first eight years of the _ chandra _ mission .",
    "the distribution of release  1 sources on the sky is presented in figure  1 .",
    "we expect that the csc will be a highly valuable tool for many diverse scientific investigations .",
    "however , the catalog is constructed from pointed observations obtained using the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory , and is neither all - sky nor uniform in depth .",
    "the first release of the catalog includes only point and compact sources , with observed extents @xmath0 . because of the difficulties inherent in detecting highly extended sources and point and compact sources that lie close to them , and quantifying in a consistent and robust way the properties of such sources , we have chosen to exclude entire fields ( or in some cases , individual acis ccds ) containing such sources from the first release of the csc , as described in   3.1 .",
    "therefore , the catalog does not include sources near some of the most famous _ chandra _ targets , and there may be selection effects that restrict the source content of the catalog and which therefore may limit scientific studies that require unbiased source samples .",
    "the minimum flux significance threshold for a source to be included in the first release of the csc is set conservatively , and corresponds typically to @xmath15 detected source photons ( on - axis ) in the broad energy band integrated over the total exposure time .",
    "this conservative threshold was chosen to maintain the spurious source rate at an acceptable level over the wide variety of _ chandra _ observations that are included in this release of the catalog .",
    "we expect to relax this criterion in future releases based on experience gained constructing the current release .",
    "a number of other _ chandra _ catalogs do include sources with fewer net counts than the csc .",
    "such fainter thresholds are attainable typically either because of specific attributes of the observations included in those catalogs , or because of the assumptions made when constructing the catalog .    as an example of the former category , the xbootes survey catalog @xcite includes sources that are roughly a factor of two fainter than the csc flux significance threshold .",
    "that survey is constructed from short ( @xmath16 ) observations obtained in an area with low line - of - sight absorption .",
    "this results in a negligible background level that substantially simplifies source detection and enables identification of sources with very few counts .",
    "catalogs derived from observations with the range of exposures comparable to those that comprise the csc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also include fainter sources",
    ". however , in these cases the additional source fractions are in general not large , typically adding @xmath17 more sources below the csc threshold , as described in detail in   3.7.1 .    for other _",
    "catalogs , visual review and validation at the source level is a planned part of the processing thread ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in some cases ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ) , visual review may be used to adjust processing parameters for individual sources .",
    "such manual steps are time - consuming , but enable lower significance levels to be achieved while maintaining an acceptable spurious source rate .",
    "in contrast , the csc catalog construction process requires that the processing pipelines run on a wide range of observations with a minimum of manual intervention .",
    "the scope of the csc is simply too large to require manual handling at the source level .",
    "we do not manually inspect individual source detections , nor do we adjust source detection or processing parameters based on manual evaluation . instead , the csc uses a largely automated quality assurance approach , as described in   3.14 .    the sky coverage of the first catalog release ( fig .",
    "2 ) totals @xmath18 square degrees , with coverage of @xmath19 square degrees brighter than a @xmath20@xmath21 flux limit of @xmath22 , decreasing to @xmath23 square degrees brighter than @xmath24 , and @xmath25 square degrees brighter than @xmath26 .",
    "these numbers will continue to grow as the _ chandra _ mission continues , with a 15 year prediction of the eventual sky coverage of the csc of order 500 square degrees , or a little over 1% of the sky .    in this paper",
    "we describe in detail the content and construction of release  1 of the csc . however , where appropriate we also discuss in addition the steps required to process hrc instrument data used to construct release  1.1 of the catalog , since the differences in the algorithms are small .",
    "release  1.1 of the catalog is scheduled for spring 2010 .",
    "this paper is organized into 5 sections , including the introduction . in   2 , we present a description of the catalog .",
    "this includes the catalog design goals , an outline of the general characteristics of _ chandra _ data that are relevant to the catalog design , the organization of the data within the catalog , approaches to data access , and an outline of the data content of the catalog .",
    "section  3 , which comprises the bulk of the paper , describes in detail the methods used to extract the various source properties that are included in the catalog , with particular detail provided when the algorithms are new or have been adapted for use with _",
    "chandra _ data .",
    "a brief description of the principal statistical properties of the catalog sources is presented in   4 ; this topic is treated comprehensively by f.  a. primini et al .",
    "( 2010 , in preparation ) .",
    "conclusions are presented in ",
    "finally , appendix  a contains details of the algorithm used to match source detection from multiple overlapping observations , as well as the mathematical derivation of the multivariate optimal weighting formalism used for combining source position and positional uncertainty estimates from multiple observations .",
    "the csc is intended to be a general purpose virtual science facility , and provides simple access to a carefully selected set of generally useful quantities for individual sources or sets of sources matching user - specified search criteria .",
    "the catalog is designed to satisfy the needs of a broad - based group of scientists , including those who may be less familiar with astronomical data analysis in the x - ray regime , while at the same time providing more advanced data products suitable for use by astronomers familiar with _",
    "chandra _ data .",
    "the primary design goals for the csc are to ( 1 )  allow simple and quick access to the best estimates of the x - ray source properties for detected sources , with good scientific fidelity , and directly support scientific analysis using the individual source data ; ( 2 )  facilitate analysis of a wide range of statistical properties for classes of x - ray sources ; ( 3 )  provide efficient access to calibrated observational data and ancillary data products for individual x - ray sources , so that users can perform detailed further analysis using existing tools such as those included in the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ; @xcite ) portable data analysis package ; and ( 4 )  include all real x - ray sources detected down to a predefined threshold level in all of the public _",
    "datasets used to populate the catalog , while maintaining the number of spurious sources at an acceptable level .    to achieve these goals , for each detected x - ray source the catalog records the source position and a detailed set of source properties , including commonly used quantities such as multi - band aperture fluxes , cross - band hardness ratios , spectra , temporal variability information , and source extent estimates .",
    "in addition to these traditional elements , the catalog includes file - based data products that can be manipulated interactively by the user .",
    "the primary data products are photon event lists ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which record measures of the location , time of arrival , and energy of each detected photon event in a tabular format .",
    "additional data products derived from the photon event list include images , light curves , and spectra for each source individually from each observation in which a source is detected .",
    "the catalog release process is carefully controlled , and a detailed characterization of the statistical properties of the catalog to a well defined , high level of reliability accompanies each release .",
    "key properties evaluated as part of the statistical characterization include limiting sensitivity , completeness , false source rates , astrometric and photometric accuracy , and variability information .",
    "both acis and hrc cameras operate in a photon counting mode , and register individual x - ray photon events . for each photon event",
    ", the two dimensional position of the event on the detector is recorded , together with the time of arrival and a measure of the energy of the event . in most operating modes ,",
    "lists of detected events are recorded over the duration of an observation , typically between @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and are then telemetered to the ground for subsequent processing .    to minimize the effect of bad detector pixels , and to avoid possible burn - in degradation of the camera by bright x - ray sources , the pointing direction of the telescope",
    "is normally constantly dithered in a lissajous pattern , with a typical scale length of about @xmath29 on the sky and a period of order @xmath27 , while taking data .",
    "the motion of the telescope is recorded via an `` aspect camera '' @xcite that tracks the motion of a set of ( usually 5 ) guide stars as a function of time during the observation . the coordinate transformation needed to remove the motion from the event ( photon ) positions",
    "is computed from the aspect camera data and applied during data processing .",
    "breaking down the 4-dimensional x - ray data hypercube into spatial , spectral , and temporal axes provides a natural focus on the properties that may be of interest to the general user , but also identifies some of the complexities inherent in _ chandra _ data that must be addressed by catalog construction and data analysis algorithms .",
    "spatially , the _ chandra _ psf varies significantly with off - axis and azimuthal angle ( with the former variation dominating ) , as well as with incident photon energy ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "close to the optical axis of the telescope , the psf is approximately symmetric with a 50% enclosed energy fraction radius of order @xmath30 over a wide range of energies , but at @xmath31 off - axis the psf is strongly energy - dependent , asymmetric , and significantly extended , with a 50% enclosed energy fraction radius of order @xmath32 at @xmath33 .    for the widely used acis detector ,",
    "the instrumental spectral energy resolution is of order @xmath34@xmath35 , and depends on incident photon energy and location on the detector . because the energy resolution is significantly lower than the typical energy width of the features and absorption edges that define the effective area of the telescope optics ( and therefore the quantum efficiency of the telescope plus detector system ) , a full matrix formulation that considers the redistribution of source x - ray flux into the set of instrumental pulse height analyzer bins must be used when performing spectral analyses .",
    "this is in contrast to the more familiar scenario from many other wavebands , where the instrumental resolution is often much higher than the spectral variation of quantum efficiency , enabling the commonly used implicit assumption that the flux redistribution matrix is diagonal ( and is therefore not considered explicitly ) .",
    "we note in passing that _ chandra _ is equipped with a pair of transmission gratings that can be inserted into the optical path , and is therefore capable of performing high spectral resolution ( slitless spectroscopy ) observations .",
    "however , such observations are not included in the current release of the csc .",
    "time domain analyses must consider the impact of spacecraft dither within an observation .",
    "strong false variability signatures at the dither frequency can arise because of variations of the quantum efficiency over the detector , or because the source or background region dithers off the detector edge or across a gap between adjacent acis ccds .",
    "corrections for these effects , as well as for cosmic x - ray background flares that can be highly variable over periods of a few kiloseconds , must be applied when computing light - curves .",
    "the extremely low photon event rates common for many faint x - ray sources typically require time domain statistics to be evaluated using event arrival - time formulations instead of rate - based approaches .",
    "an additional level of complexity occurs because many astronomical sources of interest that will be included in the catalog are extremely faint .",
    "rigorous application of poisson counting statistics is required when deriving source properties and associated errors , separating x - ray analyses from many other wavebands where gaussian statistics are typically assumed .",
    "the tabulated properties included in the csc are organized conceptually into two separate tables , the _ source observations table _ and the _ master sources table_.",
    "distinguishing between source detections ( as identified within a single observation ) and x - ray sources physically present on the sky is necessary because many sources are detected in multiple observations and at different off - axis angles ( and therefore have different psf extents ) .",
    "each record included in the source observations table tabulates properties derived from a source detection in a single observation .",
    "these entries also include pointers to the associated file - based data products that are included in the catalog , which are all observation - specific in the first catalog release .",
    "each record in the source observations table is further split internally into a set of source - specific data and a set of observation - specific , but source - independent , data .",
    "the latter are recorded once to avoid duplication .",
    "a description of the data columns recorded in the source observations table for each source detection is provided in table  1 .    -0.75truein -0.75truein    -0.75truein -0.75truein    -0.75truein -0.75truein    -0.75truein -0.75truein    -0.75truein -0.75truein    -0.75truein -0.75truein    -0.75truein -0.75truein    -0.75truein -0.75truein    -0.75truein -0.75truein    -0.75truein -0.75truein    -0.75truein -0.75truein    -0.75truein -0.75truein    because of the dependence of the psf extent with off - axis angle , multiple distinct sources detected on - axis in one observation may be detected as a single source if located far off - axis in a different observation ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "during catalog processing , source detections from all observations that overlap the same region of the sky are spatially matched to identify distinct x - ray sources .",
    "estimates of the tabulated properties for each distinct x - ray source are derived by combining the data extracted from all source detections and observations that can be uniquely associated , according to the algorithms described in   3 .",
    "the best estimates of the source properties for each distinct x - ray source are recorded in the master sources table .",
    "a description of the data columns recorded in the master sources table for each source is provided in table  2 .",
    "each distinct x - ray source is thus conceptually represented in the catalog by a single entry in the master sources table , and one or more associated entries in the source observations table ( one for each observation in which the source was detected ) .",
    "all of the tabulated properties included in both the master sources table and the source observations table can be queried by the user .",
    "bi - directional links between the entries in the two tables are managed transparently by the database , so that the user can access all observation data for a single source seamlessly .",
    "if a source detection included in the source observations table can be related unambiguously to a single x - ray source in the master sources table , then the corresponding table entries will be associated by `` unique '' linkages .",
    "source detections included in the source observations table that can not be related uniquely to a single x - ray source in the master source table will have their entries associated by `` ambiguous '' linkages ( fig .",
    "the data from ambiguous source detections are not used when computing the best estimates of the source properties included in the master sources table . in the case of acis observations , source detections for which the estimated photon pile - up fraction @xcite exceeds @xmath36",
    "will not be used if source detections in other acis observations do not exceed this threshold .    using the linkages between the entries in the two tables",
    ", the user will nevertheless be able to identify all of the x - ray sources in the catalog that could be associated with a specific detection in a single observation , and vice - versa .",
    "these linkages may be important , for example , when identifying candidate targets for follow - up studies based on a data signature that is only visible in the observation data for a confused source .      the primary user tool for querying the csc is the cscview web - browser interface @xcite , which can be accessed from the public catalog web - site .",
    "the user can directly query any of the tabulated properties included in either the master sources table or the source observations table , display the contents of an arbitrary set of properties for matching sources , and retrieve any of the associated file - based data products for further analysis .",
    "cscview provides a form - based data - mining interface , but also allows users to enter queries written using the astronomical data query language ( adql ; @xcite ) standard directly .",
    "query results can be viewed directly on the screen , or saved to a data file in multiple formats , including tab - delimited ascii ( which can be read directly by several commonly used astronomical applications ) and international virtual observatory alliance ( ivoa ) standard formats such as votable @xcite .",
    "automated access to query the catalog from data analysis applications and scripts running on the user s home platform was identified as being needed for several science use cases .",
    "vo standard interfaces , including simple cone search @xcite and simple image access @xcite , provide limited query and data access capabilities , while more sophisticated interactions are possible through a direct url connection .",
    "support for vo workflows using applicable standards will be added in the future as these standards stabilize .",
    "an interface that integrates catalog access with a visual sky browser provides a simple mechanism for visualizing the regions of the sky included in the catalog , and may also be particularly beneficial for education and public outreach purposes .",
    "since _ chandra _ is an ongoing mission , the csc includes a mechanism to permit newly released observations to be added to the catalog and be made visible to end users , while at the same time providing stable , well - defined , and statistically well - characterized released catalog versions to the community .",
    "this is achieved by maintaining a revision history for each database table record , together with flags that establish whether catalog quality assurance and catalog inclusion criteria are met , and using distinct views of the catalog databases that utilize these metadata .",
    "`` catalog release views '' provide access to each released version of the catalog , with the latest released version being the default .",
    "catalog releases will be infrequent ( no more than of order 1 per year ) because of the controls built in to the release process , and because of the requirement that each release be accompanied by a detailed statistical characterization of the included source properties .",
    "once data are included in a catalog release view , then they are frozen in that view , even if the source properties are revised or the source is deleted in a later catalog release .",
    "a source may be deleted if the detection is subsequently determined to be an artifact of the data or processing , but the most likely reason that a source is deleted from a later catalog release is that additional observations included in the later release resolve the former detection into multiple distinct sources .",

    "because on - going processing is continually modifying the catalog database , tabulated data and file - based data products in a database view may be superseded at any time , and the statistical properties of the data are not guaranteed .",
    "we anticipate that users who require a stable , well - characterized dataset will choose primarily to access the catalog through the latest catalog release view . on the other hand , users who are interested in searching the latest data to identify sources with specific signatures for further study will likely use the latest database view .",
    "the first release of the csc includes detected sources whose flux estimates are at least 3 times their estimated @xmath1 uncertainties , which typically corresponds to about 10 net ( source ) counts on - axis and roughly 2030 net counts off - axis , in at least one energy band . in this release , multiple observations of the same field are _ not _ combined prior to source detection , so the flux significance criterion applies to each observation separately .",
    "for each source detected in an observation , the catalog includes approximately 120 tabulated properties .",
    "most values have associated lower and upper confidence limits , and many are recorded in multiple energy bands .",
    "the total number of columns included in the source observations table ( including all values and associated confidence limits for all energy bands ) is 599 .",
    "roughly 60 master properties are tabulated for each distinct x - ray source on the sky , generated by combining measurements from multiple observations that include the source .",
    "combining all values and associated confidence limits for all energy bands yields a total of 287 columns included in the master sources table .",
    "the tabulated source properties fall mostly into the following broad categories : source name , source positions and position errors , estimates of the raw ( measured ) extents of the source and the local point spread function , and the deconvolved source extents , aperture photometry fluxes and confidence intervals measured or inferred in several ways , spectral hardness ratios , power - law and thermal black - body spectral fits for bright ( @xmath37 net counts ) sources , and several source variability measures ( gregory - loredo , kolmogorov - smirnov , and kuiper tests ) .    also included in the csc",
    "are a number of file - based data products in formats suitable for further analysis in ciao .",
    "these products , described in table  3 , include both full - field data products for each observation , and products specific to each detected observation - specific source region .",
    "the full - field data products include a `` white - light '' full - field photon event list , and multi - band exposure maps , background images , exposure - corrected and background - subtracted images , and limiting sensitivity maps .",
    "source - specific data products include a white - light photon event list , the source and background region definitions , a weighted ancillary response file ( the time - averaged product of the combined telescope / instrument effective area and the detector quantum efficiency ) , multi - band exposure maps , images , model ray - trace psf images , and optimally binned light - curves .",
    "observations obtained using the acis instrument additionally include low - resolution ( @xmath38@xmath39 , depending on incident photon energy and location on the array ) source and background spectra and a weighted detector redistribution matrix file ( the probability matrix that maps photon energy to detector pulse height ) .",
    "the energy bands used to derive many csc properties are defined in table  4 .",
    "the energy bands are chosen to optimize the detectability of x - ray sources while simultaneously maximizing the discrimination between different spectral shapes on x - ray color - color diagrams .",
    "the effective area of the telescope ( including both the _ chandra _ high resolution mirror assembly [ hrma ] and the detectors ) is shown in figure  6 as a function of energy , together with the average acis quiescent backgrounds derived from blank sky observations @xcite . the effective area is measured at the locations of the nominal `` acis - s '' aimpoint on the acis s3 ccd , and the nominal `` acis - i '' aimpoint on the acis i3 ccd .    where possible , the energy bands are chosen to avoid large changes of effective area within the central region of the band , since such variations degrade the accuracy of the monochromatic effective energy approximation described below .",
    "for example , the m - edge of the iridium coating on the hrma has significant structure in the @xmath40@xmath41 energy range that provides a natural breakpoint between the acis medium and hard energy bands .",
    "note however , that large effective area variations are unavoidable within the acis broad and soft energy bands and the hrc wide energy band .    weighting the effective area by the source spectral shape and integrating over the bandpass provides an indication of the relative detectability of a source in the energy band . selecting energy band boundaries so that source detectability is roughly the same in different energy bands more uniformly distributes poisson errors across the bands , and so enhances detectability in the various bands .",
    "several different source types were simulated when selecting energy bands .",
    "these included absorbed non - thermal ( power - law ) models with photon index values ranging from 1 to  4 , absorbed black - body models with temperature varying from @xmath42 to @xmath43 , and absorbed , hot , optically - thin thermal plasma models @xcite with @xmath44@xmath45 .",
    "in all cases , the hydrogen absorbing column was varied over the range @xmath46@xmath47 .",
    "detected x - ray spectra were simulated using pimms @xcite , and then folded through the bandpasses to construct synthetic x - ray color - color diagrams ( see fig .  7 for example color - color diagrams based on the final band parameters ) .",
    "energy bands chosen to fill the color - color diagrams maximally provide the best discrimination between different spectral shapes . for detailed x - ray spectral - line modeling ,",
    "the @xcite models have been superseded by more recent x - ray plasma models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , since the radiated power of the newer models as a function of temperature is not significantly different from the 1993 versions of the @xcite models used here , the latter are entirely adequate for the purpose of evaluating coverage of the x - ray color - color diagrams and the task is greatly simplified because of their availability in pimms .",
    "@xcite compared broad band x - ray photometry with accurate acis spectral fits and found that model - independent fluxes could be derived from the photometry measurements to an accuracy of about 50% or better for a broad range of plausible spectra .",
    "they used similar but not identical energy bands to those adopted for the csc , but did not use the method of deriving fluxes from individual photon energies employed herein .    combining all of these considerations @xcite yields the following selection of energy bands for the csc .",
    "the acis soft ( _ s _ ) energy band spans the energy range 0.5@xmath48 .",
    "the lower bound is a compromise that is set by several considerations .",
    "acis calibration uncertainties increase rapidly below @xmath49 , so this establishes a fairly hard lower limit to avoid degrading source measurements in the energy band . as shown in figure  8 , below about @xmath50 the background count rate begins to increase rapidly , while the integrated effective area rises very slowly resulting in few additional source counts .",
    "while pushing the band edge to higher energy will result in a lower background , the integrated effective area drops rapidly if the lower bound is raised above @xmath51 , reducing the number of source counts collected in the band .",
    "we choose to set the lower bound equal to @xmath49 since doing so enhances the detectability of super - soft sources , while not noticeably impacting measurements of other sources . the upper cutoff for the soft energy band",
    "is set equal to @xmath52 , which balances the preference for uniform integrated effective areas amongst the energy bands with the desire to maximize the area of x - ray color - color plot parameter space spanned by the simulations .",
    "the lower bound of the acis medium ( _ m _ ) energy band matches the upper bound of the soft energy band .",
    "we locate the upper band cutoff at @xmath43 since this value tends to maximize the coverage of the x - ray color - color diagram .",
    "this value also moves the iridium m - edge out of the sensitive medium band , and instead placing it immediately above the lower boundary of the acis hard ( _ h _ ) energy band .",
    "the high energy boundary of the latter band is set to @xmath21 .",

    "the background rate increases rapidly at the acis - s , while below this energy the integrated effective area decreases rapidly at the acis - i aimpoint . placing the hard energy band cutoff at @xmath21 also has the advantage that the @xmath53 line is included in the band , allowing intense fe line sources to be detected without compromising the measurement quality for typical catalog sources .",
    "the acis broad ( _ b _ ) band covers the same energy range as the combined soft , medium , and hard bands , and therefore spans the energy range 0.5@xmath21 .",
    "simulations indicate that an additional energy band extending below @xmath54 is beneficial for discriminating super - soft x - ray sources in color - color plots .",
    "the acis front - illuminated ccds have minimal quantum efficiency below @xmath55 , while the response of the back - illuminated ccds extends down to @xmath56 .",
    "hydrocarbon contamination is present on both the hrma optics @xcite and the acis optical blocking filter @xcite .",
    "the latter reduces the effective area at low energies , and enhances the depth of the carbon k - edge .",
    "an acis ultra - soft ( _ u _ ) band covering @xmath57@xmath54 is added to provide better discrimination of super - soft sources .",
    "source detection is _ not _ performed in this energy band , because of the typical lower overall signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and the resulting enhanced false - source rate .    finally ,",
    "since the hrc ( particularly hrc - i ) has minimal spectral resolution , a single wide ( _ w _ ) band that includes essentially the entire pulse height spectrum ( specifically , pi values @xmath58 ) , roughly equivalent to 0.1 - 10 kev , is used for hrc observations .",
    "while bands in these general energy ranges give the best balance of count rate and spectral discrimination , our simulations indicate that the exact choice of band boundary energies is not critical at the 10% level .      in principle ,",
    "the variations of hrma effective area , detector quantum efficiency , and ( for acis ) focal plane contamination , with energy imply that energy - dependent data products such as exposure maps or psfs should be constructed by integrating the source spectrum over the energy band",
    ". this approach would be both extremely time - consuming , and require knowledge of the source spectrum that is typically not available _ a priori_. in practice , a monochromatic effective energy is chosen for each energy band to be used to construct energy dependent data products @xcite .",
    "the monochromatic effective energy for each band is determined using the relation @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the energy , @xmath61 is the effective area of the hrma , @xmath62 is the detector quantum efficiency , @xmath63 is the reduction in transmission due to focal plane contamination , @xmath64 is a power - law spectral weighting function of the form @xmath65 , and the integral is performed over the energy band .",
    "the monochromatic effective energies for each energy band were calculated for sources located at the acis - i and acis - s aimpoints , and also for the nominal aimpoint on the hrc - i detector . since the csc is constructed from observations acquired throughout the _ chandra _ mission , acis focal plane contamination models with both zero contamination ( appropriate for observations obtained early in the mission ) and the contamination level current as of late 2009 were employed .",
    "power - law spectral weighting functions with @xmath66 varying from 0.0 to 2.0 were used .",
    "setting @xmath67 gives a spectral weighting function that approximates an absorbed @xmath68 power - law spectrum , and the limits for @xmath66 were chosen to span the typical range of values determined from fits to a canonical subset of _ chandra _ datasets .",
    "the remaining parameters in equation  ( [ eqn : eeff ] ) are extracted from the _ chandra _ calibration database ( caldb ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the monochromatic effective energies for acis were chosen to be the approximate arithmetic means of the @xmath69 values derived for the acis - i and acis - s aimpoints , with zero and late 2009 focal plane contamination .",
    "for acis energy bands other than the the broad band , the monochromatic effective energies computed for a single value of @xmath66 all agree within @xmath70 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath66 is similarly small , except for the hard energy band , where varying @xmath66 from 0.0 to 2.0 changes the monochromatic effective energy from @xmath71 to @xmath72 . for the acis broad energy band ,",
    "the agreement between the different models for a single value of @xmath66 is @xmath73 .",
    "however , for this band the dependence on @xmath66 is more significant , varying from @xmath74 for @xmath75 to @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "the monochromatic effective energies used to construct the csc are reported in table  4 .",
    "although the use of a single monochromatic effective energy for each energy band simplifies data analysis by removing the dependence on the source spectrum , some error will be introduced for sources that have either _ extremely _ soft or _ extremely _ hard spectra compared to the canonical @xmath78 power - law spectral weighting function .",
    "knowledge of the expected magnitude of the error that may be introduced is helpful when evaluating catalog properties .    for both the acis medium and hard energy bands ,",
    "neither extremely soft nor extremely hard source spectra induce variations in exposure map levels that are greater than @xmath36 , so photometric errors due to source spectral shape should not exceed this value . in the acis soft energy band , very soft",
    "spectra may produce deviations of order 520% , with the largest excursions expected for the front - illuminated ccds .",
    "these differences increase to @xmath7935% for the acis ultra - soft energy band , with the largest values once again associated with the front - illuminated ccds . for all of the acis",
    "narrow energy bands , the errors induced by extremely hard spectra are much smaller than those caused by extremely soft spectra",
    ". the presence of the iridium edge and the large energy ranges included in the acis broad and hrc wide energy bands may produce significantly larger variations for extreme spectral shapes .",
    "very soft spectra can alter exposure map values by @xmath8090% in the acis broad energy band , although there is little impact in the hrc wide energy band .",
    "conversely , extremely hard spectra may induce changes up to @xmath81 in the hrc wide energy band , and @xmath8230% in the acis broad energy band . as described in   4.4 , model - based statistical characterization of csc source fluxes ( f.  a. primini et al .",
    "2010 , in preparation )  produces results that are generally consistent with these expectation , with the exception that flux errors in the acis broad energy band appear to be @xmath36 for most sources .    when computing fluxes for point sources , an aperture correction is applied to compensate for the fraction of the psf that is not included in the aperture .",
    "since the extent of the _ chandra _ psf varies with energy , using a monochromatic effective energy can introduce a flux error because the energy dependence of the psf fraction is not considered .",
    "this error can be bounded by a _",
    "post facto _ comparison of psf fractions for catalog source detections in the 5 acis energy bands . the majority of variations _ between _ energy bands fall in the range 48% , with 90% of source detections showing @xmath83 differences .",

    "subsequent application of the time - dependent aspect solution removes the spacecraft dither motion , and maps the event positions to a uniform virtual `` sky '' pixel plane .",
    "the latter has the same pixel scale as the original instrumental pixels , but is oriented with north up ( @xmath84 direction ) and is centered at the celestial coordinates of the tangent plane position for the observation . as an aid to users , the location of each event in each coordinate system is recorded in the calibrated photon event list .",
    "a simple unrotated world coordinate system transform maps sky positions to icrs right ascension and declination by applying the plate scale calibration to the difference between the position of the source and a fiducial point , which is typically the optical axis of the telescope .",
    "the celestial coordinates of the fiducial point are determined from the aspect solution .",
    "sky images are constructed from the calibrated photon event lists by binning photon positions in sky coordinates into a regular , rectangular image pixel grid .",
    "a consequence of constructing images by binning in sky coordinates is that _ chandra _ images are always oriented with north up .",
    "the choice of image blocking factor determines the number of sky pixels that are binned into a single image pixel .",

    "the corresponding blocking factors for hrc - i observations are 2 , 5 , and 12 .",
    "using a constant blocked image size of @xmath85 pixels reduces overall data volume , while preserving resolution in the outer areas of the field of view where the psf size is significantly larger than a single pixel .",

    "the latter rule allows many sources surrounding bright , extended cores of galaxies to be included in the catalog , rather than having the entire observation rejected outright .",
    "while the visual inspection and rejection process is inherently subjective in nature , an attempt was made to calibrate the method by constructing a `` training set '' of several hundred observations that were processed through a test version of the catalog pipelines .",
    "the training set observations included a wide variety of point , compact , and extended sources , with differing exposures and snr , which were classified as accept / reject based on the actual results of running the pipeline source detection and source property extraction steps . these observations and classifications",

    "the dimensions of the sampling area act effectively as a spatial low pass filter that determines the minimum angular size that contributes to the background .",
    "high spatial frequency linear features , commonly referred to as `` readout streaks , '' result when bright x - ray sources are observed with acis .",

    "all pixels along a given readout column are effectively exposed to all points on the sky that lie along that column during the frame transfer interval , so that columns including bright x - ray sources have enhanced count rates along their length . unless accounted for by the source detection step , the increased counts in the bright readout streak are detected as multiple sources .",

    "these values are replicated across each ccd row to create an image that includes the sum of the readout streak contribution and the mean one - dimensional low spatial frequency background component .",
    "the latter must be accounted for when combining the high spatial frequency readout streak map with the two - dimensional low spatial frequency background map .    for the algorithm to obtain a good measure of the background , of order 100",
    "bright - source - free rows are required .",
    "this condition is satisfied for most observations",

    "faint sources that fall in the source - free rows will be considered to be part of the background , which can lead to similar results .",

    "these simulations were performed early in the catalog processing pipeline development cycle , as an aid in selecting the source detection algorithm to be used for catalog construction .",
    "they did not make use of the background maps described in the previous section .",
    "the actual performance of the source detection process used to construct the csc is established from more detailed and robust simulations , as described in   4 and references therein .",
    "based on the results of the simulations , wavdetect was selected as the source detection method of choice for the csc .",
    "the wavdetect algorithm does not require a uniform psf over the field of view , and is effective in detecting compact sources in moderately crowded fields with variable exposure and poisson background statistics . to detect candidate sources in a two - dimensional image @xmath119",
    ", wavdetect repeatedly constructs the two - dimensional correlation integral @xmath120 for a set of marr ( `` mexican hat '' ) wavelet functions , @xmath121 , with scale sizes that are appropriate to the source dimensions to be detected .",
    "the elliptical form of the marr wavelet may be written in the dimensionless form @xmath122 where @xmath123 and the parameters @xmath124 define the semi - major and semi - minor radii and rotation angle of the mexican hat .    a localized clump of counts in the image @xmath119 will produce a local maximum of @xmath63 if the scale sizes defined by @xmath125 are approximately the same as , or larger than , the dimension of the clump . to determine whether a local maximum of @xmath63 is due to the presence of a _ source _ , the detection significance , @xmath126 , in each image pixel @xmath127",
    "is determined from @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the number of background counts within the limited spatial extent of @xmath121 , and @xmath130 is the probability of @xmath63 given the background @xmath131 . if @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is a defined limiting significance level , then pixel @xmath127 is identified as a source pixel .",
    "the limiting significance level used to generate the csc is set to @xmath134 .",
    "this formally corresponds to @xmath135 false source due to random fluctuations per @xmath136 pixel image , although due to the heuristics of the algorithm , the actual number of false sources may be lower .",
    "the situation is further complicated in our case because the final candidate source list output from the csc source detection pipeline is a combination of several wavdetect runs in different energy bands ( see below ) .",
    "we note that reliable quantitative estimates of the false source rates and detection efficiency can only be provided through simulations , as discussed in ",
    "4 . as described in   2.5 , we impose an additional restriction on the flux significance of a source . to ensure that the flux significance requirement is the defining criterion for a source to be included in the catalog",
    ", we have verified that the flux significances of sources that pass our wavdetect threshold extend well below that required to satisfy the flux significance rule ( see figure  13 ) .",
    "we estimate that roughly @xmath137 of all the sources detected by wavdetect fall below this threshold .",
    "source detection is performed recursively by applying wavdetect to multiply - blocked sky images constructed as described in   2.5.3 .",
    "the use of a constant blocked image size maintains algorithm efficiency while not compromising detection efficiency in the outer areas of the field of view where the psf size is significantly larger than a single pixel .",
    "applied to the csc , wavelets with scales @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 ( blocked ) pixels are computed for each image blocking factor and each energy band except for the acis ultra - soft band .",
    "this combination of wavelet scales and image blocking factors provides good sensitivity for detection of sources with observed angular extents @xmath0 .",
    "some point sources with extreme off - axis angles , @xmath143 , may not be detected because the size of the local psf exceeds the largest wavelet scale / blocking factor combination .",
    "f.  a. primini et al .",
    "( 2010 , in preparation )  calibrate this effect statistically .",
    "source detection is not performed in the acis ultra - soft energy band .",
    "this band is impacted heavily both by increased background and by decreased effective area because of acis focal plane contamination ( the ratio of integrated background to effective area is 12 orders of magnitude larger for the _ u _ band when compared to the other acis energy bands ) . under these circumstances",
    "we are limited by the accuracy of the background map determination ; small errors in the background map result in an unacceptable fraction of spurious source detections .",
    "the wavdetect algorithm incorporates steps to compare nearby correlation maxima identified at multiple wavelet scales to ensure that each source is counted only once .",
    "after duplicates are eliminated , a source cell that includes the pixels containing the majority of the source flux is constructed .",
    "although a source cell may have an arbitrary shape , for simplicity an elliptical representation of the source region is used throughout the csc .",
    "the lengths of the semi - axes of this source region ellipse are set equal to the @xmath144 orthogonal deviations of the distribution of the counts in the source cell .",
    "source region ellipses for candidate sources detected within a single observation from images with different blocking factors or in different energy bands are combined outside of wavdetect to produce a single merged source list .",
    "this step rejects any detections that have rms radii smaller than the 50% enclosed counts fraction radius of the local psf , calculated at the monochromatic effective energy of the band in which the source is detected .",
    "such detections are likely artifacts arising from cosmic ray impacts .",
    "candidate source detections whose centroids are closer than the local psf radius , or that are closer than @xmath145 of the mean detected source ellipse radii , are deemed to be duplicates .",
    "if any duplicates are identified , then the detection from the image with the smallest blocking factor is kept , and if the image blocking factors are equal , then the detection with the highest significance is used .",
    "this approach ensures that data from the highest spatial resolution blocked image will be used to detect point and compact sources .",
    "however , knotty emission that is located on top of extended structures will tend to be identified as distinct compact sources , while the extended emission is not recorded .",
    "numerous source - specific catalog properties are evaluated within defined apertures .",
    "we define the `` psf 90% ecf ( enclosed counts fraction ) aperture '' for each source to be the ellipse that encloses 90% of the total counts in a model psf centered on the source position . because the size of the psf is energy dependent ,",
    "the dimensions of the psf 90% ecf aperture vary with energy band .",
    "we define the `` source region aperture '' for each source to be equal to the corresponding @xmath144 source region ellipse included in the merged source list , scaled by a factor of @xmath146 . like the psf 90% ecf aperture",
    ", the source region aperture is also centered on the source position , but the dimensions of the aperture are _ independent _ of energy band .",
    "evaluation of model psfs with off - axis angles @xmath147 demonstrates that the dimensions of the source region aperture correspond _",
    "approximately _ to the dimensions of the psf 90% ecf ellipses for the acis broad energy band .",
    "this is confirmed _ a posteriori _ by examining the distribution of psf aperture fractions in source and background ( see below ) region apertures of all individual catalog sources with acis broad band flux significance @xmath148 .",
    "figure  14 demonstrates that the source region apertures typically include @xmath14995% of the psf , while the background region apertures contain @xmath15010% .",
    "we emphasize that while these fractions are typical , the actual psf fractions , determined by integrating the model psf over the source and background region apertures and excluding regions from contaminating sources , are used for the actual determination of source fluxes ( see   3.7 ) .",
    "comparison of the source fluxes within the psf 90% ecf aperture and the source region aperture provide a crude indication whether a source is extended .",
    "if the flux in the source region aperture is significantly greater than the flux in the psf 90% ecf aperture , then the source region determined by wavdetect is considerably larger than the local psf , and the source is likely extended .",
    "both the psf 90% ecf aperture and the source region aperture are surrounded by corresponding background region annular apertures . in both cases ,",
    "the inner edge of the annulus is set equal to the outer edge of the corresponding source aperture , while the radius of the outer edge of the annulus is set equal to @xmath151 the inner radius of the source region aperture .",
    "although the background region apertures defined in this manner include @xmath15210% of the x - rays from the source , this contamination is accounted for explicitly when computing aperture photometry fluxes .",
    "overlapping sources could contaminate any measurements obtained through the source and background apertures . to avoid this ,",
    "both types of apertures are modified to exclude areas that are included in any overlapping source region apertures , or that fall off the detector .",
    "areas surrounding acis readout streaks are also excluded from the modified background apertures . _",
    "aperture - specific catalog quantities are derived from the event data in the appropriate modified aperture . _",
    "the fractions of the local model psf counts that are included in the modified apertures are recorded in the catalog for each source , and are used to apply aperture corrections when computing fluxes , under the assumption that the source is well modeled by the psf .",
    "the modified source region and background region aperture definitions are recorded as fits files using the spatial region file convention @xcite .",
    "ciao @xcite can be used to apply these regions as spatial filters to extract the photon event data for the source ( or background ) from the archived photon event list . to simplify access to file - based data products ( see table  3 ) for individual sources",
    ", we also separately store the source region photon event list , per - band exposure maps , and per - band source region images .",
    "these products include data from the rectangular region of the sky that is oriented north ",
    "south / east  west and that bounds the background region .",
    "each source record in the csc master sources table is constructed by combining source detections included in the source observations table from one or more observations .",
    "a necessary first step in this process requires matching the source detections from all of the observations that include the same region of the sky .",
    "cross - matching algorithms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are often focussed on efficiently matching large catalogs , and typically use criteria on the position difference distribution , or cross - correlation approach techniques , for identifying matches . in many cases ,",
    "these approaches assume ( often implicitly ) that the source psf is at least approximately spatially uniform across the field of view , and comparable between the datasets being matched .    however , when matching source detections across multiple _ chandra _ observations , the strong dependence of the psf size with off - axis angle must be considered explicitly , since source detections that are well off - axis in one observation are often resolved into multiple sources close to the optical axis in other observations . under these circumstances",
    "the source positions determined by wavdetect are _ not _ comparable , and can not be used for source matching . instead , the source matching approach used for the csc",
    "is based on the overlaps between the psf 90% ecf apertures of the source detections from the individual observations .",
    "although empirical in nature , this algorithm works well for matching compact source detections between _ chandra _ observations .",
    "the detailed algorithm is described in appendix  a. the method identifies the overlap fractions between the psf 90% ecf apertures of overlapping source detections from the observations , and separates them into three different categories .",
    "the first category is the simplest , where the source detections from the various observations have apertures that all mutually overlap ( fig .",
    "15 , _ left _ ) .",
    "this is the most common situation , and corresponds to the case where the source detections all uniquely match a single source on the sky .",
    "roughly 90% of the @xmath153 sources in the master sources table that are linked to more than one source detection in the source observations table fall into this category .",
    "each of the matching entries in the latter table will be associated with the corresponding master sources table entry with a `` unique '' linkage , as described in   2.3 .",
    "in the second category , the aperture associated with a source detection in one observation overlaps the apertures associated with multiple distinct source detections from other observations .",
    "this circumstance typically arises because source detections from a single observation are always assumed to be distinct ; this assumption can fail very far off - axis ( @xmath154 ) , where the psf size exceeds the maximum wavdetect wavelet scale / image blocking factor combination .",
    "this category is illustrated in figure  15 , _",
    "center _ , and arises most often because a source detection in one observation is resolved into multiple sources by one or more of the overlapping observations .",
    "the unresolved source detection in the source observations table will be connected to all master sources table entries associated with the matching resolved source detections via `` ambiguous '' linkages , and the detection will be flagged as confused .",
    "the x - ray photon events associated with the unresolved detection can not be distributed across the matching resolved sources . in release 1 of the csc",
    ", source properties derived from the detection will not be used to compute the source properties included in the master sources table .",
    "upper limits for photometric quantities could in principle be extracted from the unresolved source detection , and these would be quite valuable for variability studies . this capability will be included in a future release of the csc .    in a few cases , a set of aperture overlaps can not be resolved automatically using the current algorithm .",
    "this third category typically occurs when there are multiple overlapping , confused source detections . in this case",
    ", the source detections are flagged for review by a human , who is then responsible for resolving the matches .",
    "only 415 ( out of 94,676 ) master sources include source detections that required manual review , and the majority of these were readily resolved as confused `` pairs of pairs . '' the latter case , which is illustrated in figure  15 , _ right _ commonly occurs because a pair of source detections included in a single observation both overlap a pair of source detections in another observation .",
    "each of the source detections in the first observation overlaps both source detections in the second observation , making the detections confused , and vice - versa .",
    "if a manual review is required to complete a match for a specific source , then a flag is set in the catalog to indicate this fact .",
    "the actual processing required to perform the matches is complex . whenever new overlapping source detections are identified during catalog processing , the set of matches is recomputed using all of the observations processed so far .",
    "the algorithm then queries the prior state of the catalog , and determines the set of updates that are necessary to migrate from that state to the newly determined state .",
    "this procedure works regardless of the order in which observations processed , and also permits an already - processed observation to be reprocessed should an error have occurred .",
    "each distinct x - ray source included in the master sources table is assigned a name that is derived from the source s location on the sky .",
    "catalog sources are designated `` cxo j@xmath155 , '' where @xmath156 and @xmath157 are the icrs right ascension and declination , respectively , of the source position , _ truncated _ to the indicated precision .",
    "this format complies with the international astronomical union ( iau ) recommendations for nomenclature .",
    "the `` cxo '' prefix is registered with commission  5 of the iau for exclusive use in source designations issued by the _",
    "chandra _ x - ray center .",
    "the name assigned to a source is determined from the combined source position once the detections of the source are merged according to   3.4.2 .",
    "if the source has never been included in a released version of the csc , then the source name may be revised if a source detection in a subsequently processed observation modifies the combined source position .",
    "therefore , the name assigned to a source that is visible in a database view _ may _ change as new observations are processed , if the source has never been included in a catalog release .",
    "once a source is included in a released version of the csc , then the name of that source is frozen .",
    "the name will not be changed in either future catalog release views ( i.e. , subsequent catalog releases ) or database views , even if additional observations refine the source position . therefore minor discrepancies can arise between the latter and the source designation . however",
    ", if an observation included in a later catalog release resolves an apparently single source included in an earlier version of the catalog into multiple distinct sources , then the previous source designation is retired and new names are assigned to the resolved sources .      within a single observation ,",
    "the detected source positions are those assigned by the wavdetect algorithm .",
    "their accuracy can be estimated by evaluating the mean ( signed ) coordinate differences between the wavdetect positions and the positions of matching sources in the seventh data release ( dr7 ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "the latter are extracted from the csc / sdss cross - match catalog ] .",
    "as shown in figure  16 , the mean coordinate differences demonstrate good position agreement between the csc and sdss for sources with @xmath158 ( where we have restricted the comparison to include only individual observations of csc sources with at least 500 net counts to minimize statistical errors )",
    ".    for larger off - axis angles , figure  16 suggests that there may be a systematic offset between the wavdetect source positions and the sdss source positions .",
    "the measured mean position difference is @xmath159 for @xmath160 , but appears to increase with off - axis angle .",
    "the exact cause of this offset is uncertain .",
    "some authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have reported a similar effect , which they attribute to centroiding errors introduced by of the asymmetric nature of the _ chandra _ psf at large off - axis angles .",
    "high quality psf simulations generated using the saotrace ( formerly saosac ) ray - trace code @xcite confirm that the asymmetry can displace the measured centroid from the requested location of the simulated psf on a uniform pixel grid .",
    "we designate the vector orientation from the measured centroid position to the requested location of the psf as @xmath161 .",
    "as shown in figure  16 , the expected centroid displacement along @xmath161 computed from the simulations is not a good measure of the actual mean coordinate difference , which is a factor of order 2 times smaller than predicted by the models .",
    "one possible reason for the disagreement between the model and actual measurements is that the _ chandra _ plate scale calibration was derived from observations of ngc  2516 and lmc  x-1 using source centroid measurements that were _ not _ corrected for the asymmetry of the psf @xcite .    as described in   2.5.3 , the celestial coordinates of a source observed by _",
    "chandra _ are computed by applying a series of transforms to the measured position of the source on the detector .",
    "the final step in this process applies the measured plate scale calibration to the difference between the position of the source on the virtual sky pixel plane and a known fiducial point , which is typically the telescope optical axis .",
    "if all of the star - star baselines used to calibrate the plate scale were oriented parallel to @xmath161 , then the lack of correction for the psf asymmetry would to first order compensate for the linear component of the systematic position offset when measuring real sources whose locations are fixed in world coordinates rather than virtual pixel plane coordinates .",
    "since not all star - star baselines were so aligned , some residual systematic position offset may be expected , but at an undetermined level that is less than predicted from the psf simulations .",
    "systematic position offsets can also arise from uncertainties in the detector geometry . as an example , consider imaging observations that use the nominal acis - i aimpoint .",
    "sources with @xmath158 will be located on the same ccd array as the aimpoint . as @xmath162 increases , an increasing fractions of sources will instead be positioned on acis - s array ccds , until for @xmath163 all sources",
    "will be located on the acis - s array .",
    "uncertainties in the relative positions and tilts of the acis - i and acis - s arrays would therefore introduce systematic position offsets for sources with large off - axis angles , while not impacting sources that fall on the same ccd array as the aimpoint .",
    "this signature is consistent with the absence of mean position differences measured for @xmath158 .    because of the small magnitude of the mean position differences measured for @xmath160 , we have chosen not to apply an uncertain correction to source positions in release 1 of the catalog .",
    "we plan to investigate in detail the cause of the systematic position offsets at large off - axis angles , and adjust source positions in future catalog releases if appropriate .",
    "in addition to reporting measured source positions , wavdetect also reports positional errors associated with each source detection .",
    "the reported errors are based on a statistical moments analysis , and do not consider instrumental effects such as pixelization , aspect - induced blur , or asymmetrical psf structure that may contribute to the total positional uncertainties .",
    "simulations that compare the reference positions of artificially generated sources with their positions determined by wavdetect indicate that the positional uncertainties computed by wavdetect are underestimated for sources with large off - axis angles .",
    "the simulation results , which quantify the dependence of positional uncertainties of simulated sources on off - axis angle , were found to be consistent with the more extensive simulations uses to construct the _",

    "the standard csc processing pipeline further combines acis source detections from the broad , soft , medium , and hard energy bands to construct the final detected source list .",

    "the absolute astrometric accuracy of release  1 of the csc was evaluated _",
    "post facto _ by cross - matching catalog sources with their counterparts from the sdss dr7 @xcite . like the csc",
    ", the sdss dr7 is referenced to the international celestial reference system ( icrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and has statistical positional uncertainties @xmath503 ( mas ) rms per coordinate for bright stars , with systematic errors @xmath504 @xcite . only csc - sdss source pairs with more than 90% match probability , evaluated according to the bayesian probabilistic formalism described by @xcite , were evaluated , resulting in 6,310 source pairs associated with 9,476 sources detected in individual observations .",
    "full details of the analysis and results are presented by @xcite and f.  a. primini et al .",
    "( 2010 , in preparation ) . here",
    "we summarize the main result .    for each matching csc - sdss source pair ,",
    "the separation , @xmath505 , and the total @xmath1 positon error are computed , summing in quadrature the csc and sdss errors ( and remembering that csc position errors are reported as 95% uncertainties ) .",
    "we then examine the value of reduced @xmath506 for bins in @xmath507 covering the range @xmath508@xmath116 .",
    "the value of the reduced @xmath345 is reasonably close to 1 , except for @xmath509 ( indicating that the errors are underestimated in that range ) . adding a systematic astrometric error component of @xmath177 to @xmath507 yields reduced @xmath345 near 1 for all values of @xmath510 .",
    "we therefore adopt that value as the systematic astrometric error present in release 1 of the csc .",
    "the distribution of the normalized separations for the csc - sdss source match pairs is shown in the left panel of figure  25 , together with the theoretical rayleigh distribution for the same number of sources .",
    "the overall shape of the curve agrees with the rayleigh distribution , although there is a slight deficit at high values of normalized separation , suggesting that the overall error may be overestimated for sources at large off - axis angles . in the right panel of figure  25 , we present the average csc - sdss separation as a function of off - axis angle , with the systematic astrometric error included .",
    "the average csc @xmath1 positional error ranges from @xmath219 on - axis to @xmath511 at @xmath512 off - axis .      to assess the accuracy of csc source fluxes , the measured source region aperture photon fluxes are compared with the input photon fluxes of the simulated point sources .",
    "figure  26 presents the comparison of acis broad energy band photon fluxes for simulated sources with a power - law spectrum .",
    "inspection of the figure reveals good agreement for sources with off - axis angles within @xmath118 of the aimpoint . for sources beyond @xmath118",
    ", photon fluxes appear to be systematically overestimated by a factor of @xmath513 for sources fainter than @xmath514 .",
    "the systematic error in the faint flux bins is more prominent in the acis soft energy band , in which the measured fluxes appear under - estimated for all simulated input flux levels .",
    "further investigation of this effect will be reported by f.  a. primini et al .",
    "( 2010 , in preparation ) .",
    "preliminary analysis suggests that the effect results from the use of a monochromatic exposure map ( computed at the effective energy of the band ) when determining source fluxes .",
    "models based on this assumption reproduce the general features of the apparent systematic errors , and for the assumed model power - law spectrum the error is @xmath36 in the broad , medium , and hard energy bands , @xmath515@xmath516 in the soft energy band , and @xmath517 in the ultra - soft energy band .",
    "the _ chandra _ source catalog is a general purpose virtual x - ray astrophysics facility that provides access to a carefully crafted set of scientifically useful quantities for individual x - ray sources observed by the _",

    "the first release of the catalog was published to the astronomical community in march 2009 , and includes source properties for 94,676 point and compact x - ray sources detected in a subset of public acis imaging observations from roughly the first eight years of the _ chandra _ mission .",
    "this release of the catalog includes sources with observed spatial extents are @xmath0 , and whose flux estimates are at least 3 times their estimated @xmath1 uncertainties .",
    "observations that include substantially extended sources are not included in the first release of the catalog . for each x - ray source ,",
    "the catalog tabulates about 60 distinct measured and derived source properties , generally with associated lower and upper confidence limits , in several energy bands .",
    "these properties are generally derived from all of the observations in which a source is detected . however , in the first catalog release , multiple observations are not _ combined _ prior to source detection , so the depth of the catalog is limited by the duration of the longest single exposure of a field .",
    "the catalog further tabulates roughly 120 observation - specific properties for each observation of a source , again with associated lower and upper confidence limits , and in several energy bands .",
    "tabulated source properties include source position , spatial extent , multi - band aperture fluxes computed in several different ways , x - ray hardness ratios and spectral model fits , and intra- and inter - observation variability measures . in addition to these `` traditional '' catalog elements , for each source detection the catalog includes an extensive set of fits format file - based data products that can be manipulated interactively by the user , including source images , event lists , light curves , and spectra from each observation in which a source is detected .    looking towards the future ,",
    "release 1.1 of the catalog , scheduled for spring 2010 , will include data from public hrc - i imaging observations and newly public acis imaging observations , but will otherwise retain the same limitations as release 1 . in release 2 , we plan to co - add multiple observations of the same field that use the same or similar instrument configurations , and that have similar spacecraft pointings ( within @xmath89 ) prior to source detection , to achieve fainter limiting sensitivities in many fields .",
    "we anticipate that new algorithms will allow this release to have a significantly fainter source detection threshold than release 1",
    ". this release should also provide limited improvements in the area of extended source handling ( for example allowing for the inclusion of exposures containing moderately extended emission from galaxy cores up to @xmath518 spatial scale ) , as well as numerous algorithm enhancements that will refine field and source property calculations .",

    "the procedure , referenced in   3.4.2 , for matching source detections from multiple observations that overlap the same region of the sky , is described here .",

    "the following two assumptions are made : ( a )  if a source detection in one observation is resolved into multiple source detections in a second observation , then the overlap ellipse corresponding to the former detection will overlap all of the overlap ellipses corresponding to the latter detections , and ( b )  multiple source detections in a single observation correspond to distinct sources on the sky , even if the overlap ellipses intersect spatially .    for the set @xmath519 of source detections identified in the current observation ,",

    "<S> the _ chandra _ source catalog ( csc ) is a general purpose virtual x - ray astrophysics facility that provides access to a carefully selected set of generally useful quantities for individual x - ray sources , and is designed to satisfy the needs of a broad - based group of scientists , including those who may be less familiar with astronomical data analysis in the x - ray regime . </S>",
    "<S> the first release of the csc includes information about 94,676 distinct x - ray sources detected in a subset of public acis imaging observations from roughly the first eight years of the _ chandra _ mission . </S>",
    "<S> this release of the catalog includes point and compact sources with observed spatial extents @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the catalog ( 1 )  provides access to the best estimates of the x - ray source properties for detected sources , with good scientific fidelity , and directly supports scientific analysis using the individual source data ; ( 2 )  facilitates analysis of a wide range of statistical properties for classes of x - ray sources ; and ( 3 )  provides efficient access to calibrated observational data and ancillary data products for individual x - ray sources , so that users can perform detailed further analysis using existing tools . </S>",
    "<S> the catalog includes real x - ray sources detected with flux estimates that are at least 3 times their estimated @xmath1 uncertainties in at least one energy band , while maintaining the number of spurious sources at a level of @xmath2 false source per field for a @xmath3 observation . for each detected source </S>",
    "<S> , the csc provides commonly tabulated quantities , including source position , extent , multi - band fluxes , hardness ratios , and variability statistics , derived from the observations in which the source is detected . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to these traditional catalog elements , for each x - ray source the csc includes an extensive set of file - based data products that can be manipulated interactively , including source images , event lists , light curves , and spectra from each observation in which a source is detected . </S>"
