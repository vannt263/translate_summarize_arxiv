    "the former refers to the factorization of a process into subprocesses .",
    "for example , a @xmath0 meson decay amplitude @xmath1 is written , in the factorization assumption , as the product @xcite , @xmath2 where the meson decay constant @xmath3 arises from the production of the meson @xmath4 from the vacuum , and the form factor @xmath5 is associated with the @xmath6 transition .",
    "the latter refers to the factorization of perturbative and nonperturbative dynamics in a qcd process . according to factorization theorem ,",
    "the above amplitude is expressed as @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the convolution over parton kinematic variables , the hard kernel @xmath9 absorbs perturbative dynamics , and the @xmath0 ( @xmath10 , @xmath4 ) meson distribution amplitude @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) absorbs nonperturbative dynamics in the @xmath13 decay . a piece of contribution to @xmath0 meson decays is factorizable , if it respects either eq .",

    ", the incoming partons of the quark diagrams @xmath50 and the effective diagrams @xmath43 off - shell by @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "we thus derive @xmath52 according to the formula , @xmath53 with the @xmath19 quark carrying the momentum @xmath54 .",
    "this is the way to obtain a @xmath14-dependent hard kernel without breaking gauge invariance , since the gauge dependences cancel between @xmath50 and @xmath43 .",
    "a physical quantity is wtitten as a convolution of a hard kernel with model wave functions , which are determined by methods beyond a perturbation theory , such as lattice qcd and qcd sum rules , or extracted from experimental data .",
    "a gauge - invariant hard kernel then leads to gauge - invariant predictions from @xmath14 factorization .",
    "factorization theorems have been applied to exclusive @xmath0 meson decays , and different approaches have been developed .",
    "below we compare the frameworks of perturbatiove qcd ( pqcd ) @xcite , qcd - improved factorization ( qcdf ) @xcite , and soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite . the @xmath56 transition form factor @xmath57 involved in the semileptonic decay @xmath58",
    "is expressed , in collinear factorization , as @xmath59 with the lo hard kernel @xmath60 .",
    "the parton momentum fractions @xmath61 and @xmath62 are carried by the spectator quarks on the @xmath0 meson and pion sides , respectively . obviously , the above integral is logarithmically divergent for the asymptotic model @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "an end - point singularity implies that exclusive @xmath0 meson decays are dominated by soft dynamics .",
    "that is , a heavy - to - light form factor is not calculable in collinear factorization , and @xmath57 should be treated as a soft object @xcite .",
    "this is the basis of qcdf , and subleading corrections are added systematically @xcite .",
    "the above treatment has been further elucidated in the framework of scet @xcite : only the 1 term in @xmath28 contains the end - point singularity , which leads to an @xmath64 , ie . , soft object @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath66 term does not , leading to an @xmath67 object @xmath68 with the @xmath0 meson mass @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , at leading power in @xmath70 , the @xmath71 form factor can be split into the nonfactorizable and factorizable components , @xmath72 which have different power counting in the strong coupling constant @xmath73 : the former is of @xmath74 and the latter of @xmath33 .",
    "the values of @xmath65 and @xmath75 have been determined from a fit to the @xmath76 data @xcite .",
    "the formulation of the @xmath56 transition in @xmath14 factorization theorem is different .",
    "when the parton transverse momenta are included , @xmath65 does not develop an end - point singularity , and both @xmath65 and @xmath68 are factorizable .",
    "hence , they are of the same order in @xmath73 , and can be combined into a single term , giving @xcite , @xmath77 the end - point singularity is smeared into the large logarithm @xmath78 , and absorbed into the pion wave function @xmath79 . resumming this logarithm to all orders in the conjugate @xmath80 space @xcite , we derived the sudakov factor @xmath81 , which describes the parton distribution in @xmath80 .",
    "since @xmath65 has been included , the large - energy symmetry @xcite is respected in pqcd .",
    "recently , it was proposed that the end - point singularity is attributed to a double counting of soft degrees of freedom in collinear factorization @xcite .",
    "the zero - bin subtraction removes the double counting , and leads to a modified scet formalism for @xmath65 , labelled by scet@xmath82 hereafter .",
    "the power counting of scet@xmath55 in both @xmath70 and @xmath73 is then consistent with that of pqcd .",
    "the regularization of the end - point singularity introduces the logarithms @xmath83 in scet@xmath55 @xcite , whose treatment has not yet been explained .",
    "when applying the above factorization approaches to two - body nonleptonic @xmath0 meson decays , further difference appears in the treatment of annihilation amplitudes .",
    "the @xmath84 annihilation amplitudes from the scalar penguin operators are divergent in collinear factorization , where @xmath85 is the chiral enhancement scale .",
    "because of the end - point singularity , an annihilation amplitude has been parameterized as @xmath86 in qcdf @xcite , where @xmath87 is a hadronic scale and the free parameter @xmath88 is postulated to vary in the range @xmath89 .",
    "it is not clear what mechanism generates the strong phase @xmath90 . with the similar zero - bin subtraction ,",
    "an annihilation amplitude is factorizable in scet@xmath55 , but found to be almost real @xcite .",
    "a strong phase can only be generated at loop level , ie .",
    ", at @xmath91 . however , we notice that the residual momentum carried by the @xmath80 quark in a nonfactorizable annihilation amplitude could result in a strong phase of @xmath92 @xcite , a new mechanism not included in @xcite",
    ".    the scalar penguin annihilation amplitude is also factorizable in @xmath14 factorization with the absence of the end - point singularity .",
    "furthermore , it was almost imaginary in pqcd @xcite , whose corresponding mechanism is similar to the bander - silverman - soni one @xcite : when the @xmath93 or @xmath94 quark in a loop goes on mass shell , a strong phase is produced . in the case of the annihilation topology for heavy - to - light decays ,",
    "the loop is formed by the virtual particles in the lo pqcd hard kernel and the infinitely many sudakov gluons exchanged between two partons in a light meson .",
    "the virtual particle acquires the transverse momentum @xmath14 through the sudakov gluon exchange . a sizable strong phase is then given , in terms of the principle - value prescription for the virtual particle propagator , by @xmath95 therefore , the treatment and the effect of the scalar penguin annihilation amplitude are very different in qcdf , scet@xmath82 , and pqcd .    though the scalar penguin annihilation amplitude is factorizable in both pqcd and scet@xmath55 , it is almost imaginary in the former , but real in the latter .",
    "we argue that the above different opinions can be discriminated by comparing the direct cp asymmetries in the charged @xmath0 meson decays @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the @xmath96 decays involve a @xmath0 meson transition to a pseudoscalar meson , so the penguin emission amplitude is proportional to the constructive combination of the wilson coefficients @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the chiral enhancement scale associated with the kaon .",
    "the @xmath97 decays involve a @xmath0 meson transition to a vector meson , so the penguin emission amplitude is proportional to the destructive combination @xmath100 .",
    "the annihilation effect is then less influential in the former than in the latter .",
    "if the scalar penguin annihilation is real , both decays will exhibit small direct cp asymmetries , ie . , @xmath101 .",
    "if the scalar penguin annihilation is imaginary , it will cause a larger direct cp asymmetry in @xmath97 , ie .",
    ", @xmath102 . the current data @xmath103 and",
    "@xmath104 @xcite seem to prefer an imaginary scalar penguin annihilation .",
    "according to a naive estimate of the color - suppressed tree amplitude , the hierarchy of the branching ratios @xmath105 is expected .",
    "however , the data @xcite @xmath106 show @xmath107 , giving rise to the @xmath76 puzzle . as observed in @xcite , the nlo corrections , despite of increasing the color - suppressed tree amplitude significantly , are not enough to enhance the @xmath108 branching ratio to the measured value . a much larger color - suppressed tree amplitude , about the same order as the color - allowed tree amplitude ,",
    "must be obtained in order to resolve the puzzle @xcite . to make sure that the above nlo effects are reasonable",
    ", the pqcd formalism has been applied to the @xmath109 decays @xcite , which also receive the color - suppressed tree contribution .",
    "it was found that the nlo pqcd predictions are in agreement with the data @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "we conclude that it is unlikely to accommodate the measured @xmath108 and @xmath111 branching ratios simultaneously in pqcd , and that the @xmath76 puzzle remains .",
    "it has been claimed that the @xmath76 puzzle is resolved in the qcdf approach @xcite with an input from scet @xcite : the inclusion of the nlo jet function , the hard coefficient of scet@xmath112 , into the qcdf formula for the color - suppressed tree amplitude gives sufficient enhancement of the @xmath108 branching ratio , if adopting the parameter scenario ",
    "s4 `` @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to investigate whether the proposed new mechanism deteriorates the consistency of theoretical results with other data .",
    "the formalism in @xcite has been extended to the @xmath109 decays as a check @xcite .",
    "it was found that the nlo jet function overshoots the observed @xmath113 branching ratio very much as adopting ",
    "that is , it is also unlikely to accommodate the @xmath76 and @xmath114 data simultaneously in qcdf .",
    ".polarization fractions in the penguin - dominated @xmath116 decays .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : tab1 ]    for penguin - dominated @xmath116 decays , such as those listed in table  [ tab : tab1 ] @xcite , the polarization fractions deviate from the naive counting rules based on kinematics @xcite .",
    "this is the so - called the @xmath115 puzzle .",
    "many attempts to resolve the @xmath117 polarizations have been made @xcite , which include new physics @xcite , the annihilation contribution @xcite in the qcdf approach , the charming penguin in scet @xcite , the rescattering effect @xcite , and the @xmath118 ( the magnetic penguin ) @xcite and @xmath119 @xcite transitions .",
    "the annihilation contribution from the scalar penguin operators improves the consistency with the data , because it is of the same order for all the three final helicity states , and could enhance the transverse polarization fractions @xcite .",
    "however , the pqcd analysis of the scalar penguin annihilation amplitudes indicates that the @xmath115 puzzle can not be resolved completely @xcite .",
    "a reduction of the @xmath120 form factor @xmath121 , which is associated with the longitudinal polarization , further helps accommodating the data @xcite . note that there has not yet been any measurement , which constrains @xmath121 . hence , the value of @xmath121 should have a large uncertainty .",
    "the penguin - dominated @xmath122 decays are expected to exhibit similar polarization fractions .",
    "this is the reason the longitudinal polarization fraction in the @xmath123 decay , which contains only the penguin contribution , is close to @xmath124 as listed in table  [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "another mode @xmath125 , nevertheless , shows a large longitudinal polarization fraction almost unity .",
    "this mode involves tree amplitudes , which are subdominant , and should not cause a significant deviation from @xmath126 .",
    "though the data of @xmath127 from babar still suffer a large error @xcite , the dramatically different longitudinal polarization fractions , @xmath128 , demand a deeper understanding .",
    "it is highly suggested to update or perform the measurement of @xmath129 .",
    "it is also worthwhile to investigate the @xmath130 decays @xcite , whose measurement can help discriminating the various proposals for resolving the @xmath115 puzzle .",
    "the @xmath132 decays depend on the tree amplitude @xmath133 and the qcd penguin amplitude @xmath134 .",
    "the data of the direct cp asymmetry @xmath135 then imply a sizable relative strong phase between @xmath133 and @xmath134 , which verifies the lo pqcd prediction made years ago @xcite .",
    "the @xmath96 decays contain the additional color - suppressed tree amplitude @xmath136 and electroweak penguin amplitude @xmath137 . since both @xmath136 and @xmath137 are subdominant , the approximate equality for the direct cp asymmetries @xmath138 is expected .",
    "however , this naive expectation is in conflict with the data @xcite , @xmath139 leading to one of the @xmath131 puzzles .",
    "while lo pqcd gives a negligible @xmath136 @xcite , it is possible that this supposedly tiny amplitude receives a significant subleading correction .",
    "note that the small @xmath136 is attributed to the accidental cancellation between the wilson coefficients @xmath140 and @xmath141 at the scale of the @xmath80 quark mass @xmath142 .",
    "in @xcite the important nlo contributions to the @xmath131 decays from the vertex corrections , the quark loops , and the magnetic penguins were calculated .",
    "it was observed that the vertex corrections increase @xmath136 by a factor of 3 , and induce a large phase about @xmath143 relative to @xmath133 .",
    "the large and imaginary @xmath136 then renders the total tree amplitude @xmath144 more or less parallel to the total penguin amplitude @xmath145 in the @xmath96 decays , leading to nearly vanishing @xmath146 at nlo ( it is about -8% at lo ) .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath131 puzzle has been alleviated , but not yet gone away completely . whether new physics effects @xcite are called for will become clear when the data get precise",
    ". more detailed discussion on this subject can be found in @xcite .",
    "two - body nonleptonic @xmath147 meson decays are interesting , since their study can test su(3 ) or u - spin symmetry .",
    "the framework for these decays is basically identical to that for @xmath148 meson decays .",
    "the results of two - body nonleptonic @xmath147 meson decays from different factorization approaches can be found in @xcite for qcdf , in @xcite for scet , and in @xcite for pqcd .",
    "roughly speaking , the branching ratios predicted by qcdf and by pqcd are similar , but the predicted direct cp asymmetries are usually opposite in sign .",
    "the factorization approaches are systematic theoretical tools for exclusive @xmath0 meson decays , in which hadronic inputs are universal , and the hard kernels can be computed order by order .",
    "nlo corrections have been obtained for some @xmath0 meson decay modes , and the consistency between the theoretical predictions and the experimental data is improved in general .",
    "more need to be done in order to pin down qcd uncertainty especially for those quantities exhibiting puzzling behaviors .",
    "higher - power corrections are another important source of qcd uncertainty , which deserves a careful investigation .",
    "the recent development in scet@xmath55 is encouraging , whose counting rules become consistent with those in pqcd .",
    "however , the arbitrary logarithms @xmath83 resulting from the zero - bin subtraction needs to be handled ( recall that the double logarithm @xmath149 from the smearing of the end - point singularity has been resummed in pqcd ) .",
    "we did not review the progress on the @xmath150 puzzle appearing in the extraction of the weak phase @xmath151 from penguin - dominated @xmath0 meson decays . for the detail , refer to @xcite .",
