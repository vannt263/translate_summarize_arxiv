    "transitions between inflating @xmath0 vacuua and neighboring vacuua lead to the picture of a multiverse where regions with different low energy physics properties can be found sitting next to each other .",
    "the transitions may occur by quantum nucleation of localized bubbles of the new vacuua , within the inflating parent vacuum ( an alternative mechanism is quantum diffusion , which we shall not consider here . )    the physics leading to nucleation , growth , and possible collision of bubbles is by now reasonably well understood .",
    "however , the global properties of the eternally inflating multiverse have resisted , so far , a comprehensive description with a clear interpretation .",
    "an important missing ingredient is the so - called  probability measure \" , which would allow us to make predictions for observations within the multiverse .",
    "a new approach for handling these problems was recently proposed in @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the idea was to replace the @xmath1 dimensional space - time  bulk \" description of the multiverse , with a purely spatial theory without gravity at its @xmath2 dimensional future boundary .",
    "there , the degrees of freedom of a putative cft would interact with @xmath3 dimensional defects , representing the future boundary of bulk domain walls separating the different vacua .",
    "precursors of this approach are strominger s @xmath4 correspondence @xcite , and susskind s dual",
    " census taker s hat \" @xcite .",
    "the latter involves a theory at the @xmath3 future boundary of a single domain wall , containing a minkowski vacuum embedded in the inflating multiverse .    a significant obstacle in developing the proposal of refs .",
    "@xcite was the description of @xmath5 bubbles .",
    "these contain a space - like singularity at the future boundary of their interior , and it was not clear what to do with it in the dual description .",
    "a related problem was the description of the ( mostly null ) future boundary of minkowski bubbles .",
    "based on the approach of @xcite , it was suggested in @xcite that the future boundaries of minkowski and @xmath5 bubble interiors should be simply removed from the @xmath2 regular part of the future boundary , and replaced with @xmath3 theories at the edges of the corresponding  holes \" .",
    "this heuristic prescription was adopted in order to implement a specific probability measure for the multiverse ( based on a wilsonian cut - off in the dual theory ) .",
    "however , the justification for such prescription awaits a better understanding of @xmath5 bubbles ( and of the relation between the census taker s hat approach of @xcite and the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite ) . a recent observation by maldacena @xcite may help bringing this understanding a tad closer .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , maldacena points out that the interior of @xmath5 bubbles nucleating in a minkowski ( or in a @xmath0 ) vacuum , can be described in terms of cft degrees of freedom living on the worldsheet of the domain wall .",
    "the range of the holographic coordinate is limited , and so the cft has a uv cut - off , corresponding to the @xmath5 radius @xmath6 at the location of the domain wall @xmath7 . since the worldsheet has the internal geometry of @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 ) , conformal invariance is also be broken at an ir cut - off @xmath10 corresponding to the intrinsic worldsheet curvature radius @xmath11 .",
    "the device of substituting the bubble interior with a worldsheet field theory seems to allow for a regular description of @xmath5 bubbles , bypassing the need to consider singularities at the future boundary .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to elaborate on the proposal of maldacena , by considering the interaction of bulk gravitons in the ambient parent vacuum with the cft degrees of freedom .",
    "this step may help clarifying whether and how the bulk and worldsheet degrees of freedom might fit together in a fully holographic description of the multiverse .",
    "as we shall see , the case of bubbles nucleating in an inflating vacuuum is somewhat different from that of bubbles nucleating in a minkowski vacuum . in the case of an inflating parent vacuum",
    ", the worldsheet field theory contains lower ( @xmath9 ) dimensional gravity .",
    "this suggests the possibility of a second duality , where the wordsheet degrees of freedom may be represented at the future boundary in terms of a theory without gravity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "i we consider the background solutions . in section",
    "ii , we set up the description of linearized gravitons in the bubble background .",
    "section iii discusses the worldsheet reduction of the bulk graviton dynamics , and the presence of a graviton zero mode .",
    "section iv discusses the interaction of bulk graviton scattering states with the domain wall , both in the bulk d dimensional picture and in the dual worldsheet cft picture . the transmission coefficient of gravitons accross the wall has a dual interpretation as the absorption of bulk gravitons by the cft degrees of freedom .",

    "the gradient of @xmath12 is concentrated near some value of the conformal coordinate @xmath25 . in this case",

    "nonetheless , we keep @xmath31 explicit in order to include more general solutions , without spatial slicings where the domain wall is compact . when @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the two vacua can be separated by a flat domain wall ( @xmath34 ) provided that this has a precisely tuned critical tension ( as happens for certain bps solutions ) .",
    "explicit expressions for the critical tension @xmath35 will be given below in the thin wall limit .",
    "when both @xmath15 and @xmath16 are strictly negative , then the geometry of the worldsheet will be @xmath20 if the tension is lower than the critical tension .",

    "the preceeding equations can be obtained from the equations for tensor cosmological perturbations in a frw universe with spatial curvature @xmath31 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in general , a solution of the linearized einstein s equations with scalar matter _ can not _ be brought to the form ( [ ansatz1 ] ) with ( [ ansatz2 ] ) . however",
    ", it is possible to write it in this way if the scalar field is unperturbed",
    ". this will be sufficient for our purposes in the case where the domain wall separating the two vacuum phases is very thin compared with the worldsheet curvature scale ( for @xmath45 , this follows from the analysis in @xcite .",

    ", there may be additional discrete modes , as well as the continuum .",
    "it is easy to show that in @xmath66 dimensions , the zero mode @xmath55 is the only discrete one .",

    "for instance , from ( [ n=3 ] ) , the continuum of kk modes starts after the mass gap @xmath78 @xcite .",

    "physically , the gravitational field of a domain wall of tension @xmath85 is characterized by the lengthscale @xmath92 .",

    "maldacena has suggested that the whole space - time region inside of an @xmath73 bubble can be described in terms of the boundary cft living on the worldsheet of the bubble wall .",
    "this includes the the singularity which develops at the future boundary of the bubble interior",
    ". it would therefore be interesting if this could be removed from the picture and substituted with a regular description in terms of a worldsheet cft .    in view of the preceeding analysis",
    ", a perhaps more precise statement seems to be the following . in the case of @xmath20 bubbles nucleating in minkowski space",
    ", the woldsheet cft correctly describes the effect of the bubble on the remaining minkowski space . also ,",
    "knowledge of the quantum state in the dual description is sufficient in order to determine the quantum state on an early slice @xmath120 of the open frw universe within the bubble ( see fig 1 ) . in this sense",
    ", there is complementarity .",
    "this aspect of complementarity is quite reasonable , and conforms with standard practice in explicit calculations of the quantum state of linearized cosmological perturbations in the ",
    "one bubble \" open universe ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the quantization is done on a global cauchy surface , such as the one labeled by @xmath121 in figs . 1 and 2 , which cuts through the region covered by the @xmath8 slicing of the parent vacuum .",
    "the wave function is then propagated into the frw patch , which is covered by the hyperbolic slicing @xmath120 .",
    "presumably , any quantum state in the dual picture be translated into a quantum state of bulk fields on the global cauchy surface , and then propagated into @xmath120 ( which lies in its future development ) .",
    "knowledge of the quantum state on @xmath120 allows for semiclassical probabilistic predictions inside of this frw universe ( such as , for instance , the number density of galaxies present at any given time ) .",
    "unfortunately , at the singularity , the semiclassical description breaks down , and in the absence of a good  dictionary \" , the cft description does not seem to tell us much about what will happen near the big crunch , or whether there will be a bounce .",
    "let us now elaborate more precisely on the notion of complementarity .",
    "first , it should be stressed that the dual worldsheet cft theory plus bulk modes outside the bubble will always be in a pure state if the initial condition is a pure state ( such as a @xmath8 invariant state , plus possible excitations which may be included as initial conditions ) .",
    "now , suppose for instance , that a radioactive atom falls inside of an @xmath5 bubble .",
    "the cft will certainly learn about this , as the atom crosses the bubble wall .",
    "the atom will then decay at some value of frw time @xmath122 , and the probability distribution for @xmath122 can be calculated from the boundary theory .",
    "nonetheless , it is not so clear whether the decay of a particular atom will be  communicated \" to the boundary theory , whose wave function initially included all possibilities for @xmath122 .",
    "note that , if the wave function for a particular cosmological mode on the frw slicing happens to collapse ( say , by the effect of a measurement ) to a particular amplitude @xmath123 , this would seem to force the collapse of the wave function in the dual description , so that the two unitary descriptions following the collapse are equivalent .",
    "a somewhat different perspective arises if we adopt the point of view that the collapse of the wave function is a fiction , and that all semiclassical branches of it are described by the pure state of the dual picture . in this case",
    ", the disintegration of the atom in a particular realization of its infall into the bubble need not be communicated to the boundary theory , which describes  live \" and  dead \" atoms at all times .",
    "this interpretation ( which may be referred to as weak complementarity ) seems more plausible to us than the possibility discussed in the preceding paragraph .      for bubbles nucleating in a @xmath124 background ,",
    "we have seen that in addition to the graviton scattering modes , there is a normalizable graviton zero mode , bound within the spacetime region covered by the @xmath8 foliation parallel to the worldsheet .",
    "the zero mode is not necessarily peaked on the bubble wall , but it will always have some overlap with the inside of the bubble . in the dual picture",
    "this will mediate a lower dimensional gravitational interaction amongst the worldsheet degrees of freedom .",
    "this suggests that , for bubbles nucleating in a @xmath124 parent vacuum , we may benefit from taking a further step ( see also @xcite ) . instead of just integrating out the kk gravitons on the @xmath73 side of the wall ( in order to obtain a worldsheet cft )",
    ", we may integrate out the whole region covered by the worldsheet @xmath125 foliation ( shaded region in fig .",
    "2 ) . this would define a putative field theory ( which we may denote as @xmath126 for the purposes of the present discussion ) on the lower dimensional @xmath8 .",
    "the degrees of freedom of @xmath126 are coupled to the lower dimensional gravity carried by the zero mode , with coupling @xmath63 given in eq .",

    ".    the worldsheet theory may also be useful for calculating the probabilities for events inside of the future light cone from @xmath82 , as we described in the previous subsection .",
    "however , the situation seems to be different depending on the nature of the new vacuum inside the bubble . for minkowski and @xmath5 bubbles",
    ", all interesting physics happens early on after nucleation , and probabilistic predictions in the semiclassical regime will depend strongly on the initial conditions at @xmath120 , which are in turn determined by the dual worldsheet theory @xmath126 . on the other hand ,",

    "is coupled to lower @xmath127 dimensional gravity .",
    "hence , we may be entitled to a further holographic description of this @xmath127-dimensional theory in terms of a theory without gravity at its future boundary .",
    "note that the future boundary of the whole @xmath8 foliation parallel to the worldsheet converges on a @xmath3 sphere , embedded in the @xmath2 dimensional future boundary of the bulk @xmath1 dimensional spacetime ( see fig .",

    "<S> we discuss a holographic description of vacuum bubbles , with possible implications for a consistent description of the multiverse . in particular , we elaborate on the recent observation by maldacena , that the interior of ads bubbles can be described in terms of cft degrees of freedom living on the worldsheet of the bubble wall . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the scattering of bulk gravitons in the ambient parent vacuum , off the bubble wall . in the dual description , </S>",
    "<S> the transmission coefficient is interpreted as the probability that a graviton is absorbed by the worldsheet cft degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the result is in agreement with intuitive expectations . </S>",
    "<S> conformal invariance is not exact in this setup , and the leading corrections due to the ir and uv cut - offs are displayed . aside from bulk scattering states </S>",
    "<S> , we find that when a bubble nucleates within a parent ds vacuum , there is a zero mode of the graviton which describes lower dimensional gravity with a finite newton s constant . </S>",
    "<S> this massless graviton lives within one hubble radius away from the bubble wall . </S>",
    "<S> possible implications for a fully holographic description of the inflating multiverse are briefly discussed . </S>"
