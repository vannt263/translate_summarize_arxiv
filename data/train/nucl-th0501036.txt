    "in this paper we present _ ab initio _ quantum - mechanical treatment of non - reactive scattering processes of the excited exotic hydrogen - like atoms :    * elastic scattering @xmath10 * stark mixing @xmath11 * coulomb deexcitation @xmath12    here @xmath13 are hydrogen isotopes and @xmath14 ; @xmath15 are the principal and orbital quantum numbers of exotic atom and @xmath16 are the hydrogen atom quantum numbers .",
    "the processes ( 1 ) - ( 2 ) decelerate while coulomb deexcitation ( 3 ) accelerates the exotic atoms , influencing their quantum number and energy distributions during the cascade .",
    "the last process has attracted particular attention especially after the `` hot '' @xmath17 atoms with the kinetic energy up to 200 ev were found experimentally [ 1,2 ] .",
    "starting from the classical paper by leon and bethe  [ 3 ] , stark transitions has been treated in the semiclassical straight - line - trajectory approximation ( see [ 4 ] and references therein ) .",
    "the fully quantum - mechanical treatment of the processes ( 1 ) - ( 2 ) based on the adiabatic description was given in [ 5 - 8 ] .",
    "recently [ 9,10 ] , the elastic scattering and stark transitions have also been studied in a close - coupling approach with the electron screening effect taken into account by the model .",
    "thus , at the present time we have more or less realistic description of the processes ( 1)-(2 ) in a wide range of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "concerning the acceleration process ( 3 ) , the situation here is much less defined , especially for low @xmath5 .",
    "the first work ( to the best of our knowledge ) on the cd process was performed by bracci and fiorentini [ 11 ] using the semiclassical approach with some additional approximations concerning the assumption of the large values of the quantum numbers under consideration ( @xmath18 ) and some others . in the following numerous papers [ 12 , 13 ] ( and references therein )",
    "the cd process is considered within the asymptotic approaches using the adiabatic hidden crossing theory [ 14 ] for the pure coulomb three - body systems or for the screened coulomb centers chosen in the static form ( the dipole screening ) .",
    "recently , the calculations of the process ( 3 ) were also performed in the classical - trajectory monte - carlo ( ctmc ) [ 15 ] approach . while the coulomb deexcitation cross sections obtained in ctmc approach are in fair agreement with the semiclassical ones of bracci and fiorentini",
    "[ 11 ] , the much more elaborated advanced adiabatic approach ( aaa ) [ 12,13 ] gives much smaller coulomb deexcitation cross sections which can not explain the experimental data .",
    "the reasons of such a strong discrepancy are not clear .",
    "one can only assume that the semiclassical model [ 11 ] as well as the ctmc approach are not valid for low - lying states .",
    "thus , until now there is no satisfactory description of this process in the most interesting region ( @xmath19 ) .    the main aim of this paper is to obtain the cross sections of coulomb deexcitation for @xmath20 in realistic quantum - mechanical approach which is free from the additional approximations used in previous studies , in particular , the two - state approximation .",
    "for this reason we use a unified treatment of elastic scattering , stark transitions and coulomb deexcitation within the close - coupling method .",
    "this approach was used previously for the study of the elastic scattering and stark transitions of the excited muonic hydrogen in the collisions with the hydrogen ones  [ 16 ] and a good agreement as compared with the results of the quantum - mechanical adiabatic description  [ 5 - 8 ] was obtained . in the following section we briefly describe the close - coupling formalism and the main expressions .",
    "the results of the close - coupling calculations concerning the total cross sections of the process ( 3 ) are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "iii . finally , summary and concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "the non - relativistic hamiltonian for the four - body system @xmath21 , after separating the center of mass motion , can be written in jacobi coordinates @xmath22 as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the reduced mass of the system , @xmath25 is the electrostatic interaction between the subsystems , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the hamiltonian of the free exotic and hydrogen atoms @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the wave functions of the exotic atom and hydrogen atom bound states , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the corresponding eigenvalues .",
    "the interaction potential of the subsystems is defined by @xmath33 with the two - body coulomb interactions @xmath34 here we use the set of jacobi coordinates @xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the radius - vectors of the nuclei , muon and electron in the lab - system , @xmath38 are the center of mass radius - vectors of the hydrogen and exotic atoms , respectively .",
    "the coefficients @xmath16 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the two - body interactions ( 8)-(9 ) depend on the masses of the particles , @xmath42 and satisfy @xmath43 ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the masses of the hydrogen isotopes , muon and electron , respectively ) . atomic units ( a.u ) @xmath46 will be used throughout the paper unless otherwise stated .",
    "+ the total wave function @xmath47 of the system satisfies the time independent schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian ( 4 ) : @xmath48 where @xmath6 is the total energy of the system .    in this paper , as well as in the previous studies",
    "[ 11 , 12 , 15 ] , we assume that the state of the target electron is fixed during the collision . the electron excitations can be taken into account in a straightforward manner .",
    "owing to the rotation and inversion symmetries of the total system , the vector solutions of ( 13 ) is introduced the total angular momentum representation . in a space - fixed coordinate frame",
    "we built the basis states from the eigenvectors of the operators @xmath49 and the total parity @xmath50 with eigenvalues @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively : @xmath53 where @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 here the orbital angular momentum @xmath57 of @xmath58 is coupled with the orbital momentum @xmath59 of the relative motion to give the total angular momentum , @xmath60 .",
    "then , for the fixed values of @xmath61 the exact solution of the schrdinger equation for the colliding system , @xmath62 is expanded as follows @xmath63 where the @xmath64 are the radial channel functions and the sum is restricted to @xmath65 values to satisfy the total parity conservation .",
    "this expansion leads to the coupled radial scattering equations @xmath66 where @xmath67 specify the channel wave numbers ; @xmath68 is the relative motion energy in the entrance channel , @xmath69 is the difference of the exotic atom bound energies in the initial and the final states , @xmath70 is the reduced mass of the exotic atom .",
    "finally , @xmath71 are the matrix elements that couple asymptotic channels @xmath72 and @xmath73 : @xmath74 the radial functions @xmath75 must be regular everywhere , and , at @xmath76 @xmath77 and at asymptotic distances ( @xmath78 ) satisfy the usual boundary conditions @xmath79 where @xmath80 , @xmath81 are the wave numbers of initial and final channels and @xmath82 is the scattering matrix in the total angular momentum representation .",

    "the close - coupling method described in the previous section has been used to obtain the cross sections for the collisions of the @xmath129 and @xmath130 atoms in excited states with hydrogen atoms .",
    "the present paper had at least two goals : first , to apply the fully quantum - mechanical approach for the study of the processes ( 1 ) - ( 3 ) and , second , to clear the validity of the energy and principle quantum number dependence of the coulomb deexcitation cross sections used in literature and based on the semiclassical model  [ 11 ] .",
    "so , we present here only a small part of our results . in particular , to illustrate some main features of the calculated cross sections , we discuss only the @xmath0-averaged cd cross sections . the detailed results of the calculations will be published elsewhere .    the coupled differential equations ( 20 ) are solved numerically using the numerov method and with the real boundary conditions involving the @xmath131-matrix instead of @xmath132-matrix .",
    "the corresponding @xmath133-matrix can be calculated from equation @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the unit matrix . in the calculations we have taken into account all possible multipoles in the interaction potentials and all open channels with @xmath136 .",
    "the close - coupling calculations have been carried out for the relative collision energies @xmath137 from 0.01 up to 100 ev and for the excited states with @xmath138 . at all energies",

    "there is no dependence @xmath152 as it is followed from [ 11 ] .",
    "our prediction for the @xmath5 dependence of the cd cross sections is quite different . in our opinion , this behaviour is explained by the influence of the open channels with @xmath153 which increases for the higher @xmath5 states and cant be taken into account in the two - state approaches [ 11 - 13 ] .",

    "the energy dependence of this fraction is completely different for various @xmath5 . in particular",
    ", this behaviour leads to the unexpected dependences of the cross sections on the principle quantum number @xmath5 and collisional energy @xmath169 .",
    "it is possible that the problem of the high energy fraction of the kinetic energy distribution in the muonic hydrogen is related to the unproper behaviour of the cd cross sections taken in the extended standard cascade model ( escm )  [ 17 ] for @xmath170 and based on the semiclassical model  [ 11 ] .",
