    "owing to its popularity and openness , twitter data is frequently used in scientific research . in its raw form",
    "it contains limited information about the people generating the data .",
    "enriching twitter data with age estimates is useful for scientific modelling and has commercial applications in areas such as marketing and personalised advertising .",
    "@xcite have shown that people s interests are indicative of their age and that facebook page likes can be used to predict age with high accuracy .",
    "page likes play a similar role in facebook as follows do in twitter and so this result indicates that the same results could be achieved with twitter .",
    "there are two principle causes of this effect : firstly , people of similar ages tend to have similar interests as a result of age related life events ( education , child birth , marriage , employment , retirement , wealth changes etc . ) .",
    "secondly , social networks exhibit homophily with people tending to connect with others having similar attributes ( age in this case ) , and because information about what else to follow flows through connected people @xcite .",
    "previous research into twitter age detection has focussed on linguistic models of tweets or the free text `` user name '' field .",
    "linguistic models require significant research efforts to be applied for every distinct language and has currently only been developed in dutch @xcite .",
    "in addition , any method that relies on tweets is unable to make predictions for the majority of twitter users who do not generate tweets in adequate volumes .",
    "this is a problem since the median number of tweets in our data set of 700 million users is four .",
    "methods based on user - name rely on knowledge of the relative frequency of the user s true name in their country of birth @xcite .",
    "however , twitter users are under no obligation to supply their real names and their country of birth is generally unknown .    in this paper",
    ", we take a different approach based on the hypothesis that ( a ) someone s interests depend on their age , and ( b ) what they follow describes ( some of ) their interests .",
    "we use this hypothesis to derive a machine learning model that predicts a user s age from what / whom they follow .",
    "we take the 133,000 accounts of users who specify their age in their description field as labelled ground truth .",
    "the features of the model are the 103,722 accounts that have greater than 10,000 followers and are followed by more than 10 labelled accounts .",
    "the features are subsequently used to infer the age of any twitter user based on whom / what they follow within a bayesian framework . unlike methods that rely on linguistic style or first - name frequencies , our method generalises across national and linguistic boundaries . however , a major challenge with this data is that ages specified in the description field can be inaccurate and the graph contains many spurious edges that are not indicative of true interests . for this reason , we adopt a bayesian classification paradigm , which offers a consistent framework for handling all forms of uncertainty .",
    "one of the first studies of twitter demographics was conducted by @xcite .",
    "they used a large corpus of tweets to derive demographic data for twitter users located in the us .",
    "they did not study age , choosing instead to focus on the distributions of geography , race and gender .",
    "they were able to conclude that the twitter population is not representative of the broader us populace .",
    "previous work on twitter age detection has focussed on either aspects of language or user names .",
    "for instance , @xcite produced a lexical analysis of dutch language tweets .",
    "they obtained ground truth through a manual tagging process employing several students .",
    "the principle features were simply unigrams , where the intuition was that older people use more positive language , fewer pronouns and longer words and sentences .",
    "other features like intensifiers ( emoticons ) , alphabetic lengthening ( e.g. , `` sweeeeeet '' ) and capitalisation were also useful .",
    "they found that age prediction works well for young people , but that above the age of 30 , language tends to homogenise .",
    "they also noted a strong relationship between language and gender ( women tend to identify more with language and use more first singular pronouns , while men use more links ) implying that they need to be modelled together .",
    "they used simple linear models in the study ( linear and logistic regression ) .",
    "age detection using lexical features is complicated by the existence of the concept of social age @xcite .",
    "a social age is determined by life stage ( married , children , employment etc . ) rather than years since birth and it has a strong affect on writing style . social age and gender are fluid constructs and attempts to predict them from text oversimplify the problem .",
    "for instance , people interacting in groups of the opposite sex may adapt their language to mimic the perceived social norm .",
    "@xcite estimate the age of twitter users from the first name supplied in the free - text account - name field .",
    "they use us social security data to generate probability distributions for birth year given age and show that for some names age distributions are quite sharply peaked .",
    "they also used second names to estimate ethnicity and found that both age and ethnicity have large affects on the patterns of twitter usage .",
    "@xcite used facebook - likes to determine a broad range of attributes of users .",
    "they generated ground truth through responses to a facebook app designed to measure a user s personality .",
    "they were particularly successful at identifying age ( 80% accuracy on a held out test set ) , and their approach has the benefit of generalising readily to different locales .",
    "facebook likes are closely related to twitter follows ; both are indicators of user interest .",
    "however their work differs from ours for two principle reasons .",
    "firstly facebook contains a birthday field and so age can easily be calculated given access to this field .",
    "secondly , they assumed that users accessing their app represented a stratified sample of facebook ages and we are not able to make this assumption .",
    "finally we make use of a survey of internet using americans conducted by @xcite .",
    "they identified a sample of 1802 adults ( speaking either english or spanish ) using random cold calling and recorded their demographic information and use of social media .",
    "288 of their respondents were twitter users .",
    "only roughly 0.02% of twitter profile descriptions contain age data and so working with a small sample of the network is not viable .",
    "we implemented a distributed web crawler to download the twitter graph and associated account metadata using twitter access tokens mined through an app . to optimize data throughput while remaining within twitter s rate limits we developed an asynchronous system connected to an access token server using python s twisted library  @xcite .",
    "we indexed each user s description field using apache solr and searched the index for regular expression ( regex ) patterns that were indicative of age data across twitter s four major languages ( english , spanish , french and portuguese ) .",
    "initially , we attempted to match the multilingual equivalents of the english phrases , such as `` i am _ x _ '' , `` i am _ x _ y '' , `` _ _ x _ _ years '' .",
    "this resulted in significant issues with phrases of the form `` more than _ x _ years '' , `` think i am _ x _ years '' and `` feel like _ x _ years '' , which required further refinements of the regex matching string to logically exclude these forms , e.g. , . `` _ _ x _ _ years not(feel like _ x _ years , think i am _ x _ years ) '' .",
    "this process discovered 133,000 users who disclosed their age ( i.e. , 0.02 % of the 700 million indexed accounts ) with a total of 15.9 million outgoing edges of which 7.14 million were to accounts with greater than 10,000 followers .",
    "we bucket ages of users into ten categories chosen to suit our use case of targeted marketing .",
    "the age categories and number of accounts , relative frequency and average number of features per category are shown in table [ tab : age categories ] .",
    ".age categories and counts .",
    "mean features gives the average number of feature accounts followed . [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab:3_class_stats ]    the corresponding performance statistics are shown in table [ tab:3_class_stats ] are very good with a micro f1 score of 0.86 ; the same value was achieved by @xcite .",
    "however , the major advantage of our model is that we have applied it to the entire twitter graph , as opposed to being limited to a biased sample of dutch twitter users with a sufficient number of tweets .",
    "figure [ fig : multiclass_roc_3_class ] shows the areas under the receiver - operator characteristics ( roc ) curves for the three - class model .",
    "the curves are generated by measuring the true positive and false positive rates for each class for a range of classification thresholds .",
    "a perfect classifier has an area under the curve ( auc ) equal to one , while a completely random classifier follows the dashed line with an @xmath0 .",
    "performance is excellent for classes under 18 and over 45 , but weaker for 1845 where training data was more limited .",
    "the three - class learning curve ( figure [ fig : lc_3_class ] ) indicates that performance could still be improved by adding more labelled data .",
    "a promising way to do this would be to manually label accounts self - identifying as parents , however we lacked the resources to achieve this at meaningful scale .",
    "we have evaluated the performance of a 10-class age model trained on twitter description data , which performs well with implicitly labelled age data .",
    "our model performs as well as the current state of the art on a three - class problem for inferring the age of twitter users without being limited to specific linguistic features .",
    "finally , we have successfully applied our model to the entire twitter network .",
    "figure [ fig : result_bar ] shows aggregate classification results for 700 million twitter accounts compared with expectations based on survey data @xcite .",
    "the figure shows that our model predicts that over 50% of twitter users are between 18 and 35 .",
    "much of the bias of the original training set ( figure [ fig : input_bar ] ) has been removed , largely due to bayesian inference .",
    "we have presented the first model that can classify the age of most twitter users .",
    "our work allows future researchers to build more complete models of social processes as measured on twitter and to generalise phenomena on twitter to the real world .",
    "the key idea behind our model is that a user s age can be predicted from what / whom they follow .",
    "our bayesian model delivers state - of - the - art performance equal to that achieved by the linguistic model of @xcite , but with much broader applicability and more general assumptions .",
    "we are able to achieve these results using only the biased training data that is available natively within twitter and so do not rely on manual labellers or an external application to produce training data .",
    "extensions include the combination of our results with linguistic models to attain higher fidelity estimates for particular locales and relaxing the independence assumptions between features .",
    "it is computationally intractable to explicitly model all dependencies , but algorithms , such as probabilistic pca , are able to discover the most significant correlations efficiently @xcite .",
    "this work was partly funded through a royal commission for the exhibition of 1851 industrial fellowship ."
