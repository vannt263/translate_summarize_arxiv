    "when considering quantum field theories on non - commutative spaces , e.g. by employing the so - called groenewold - moyal star product , one inevitably has to deal with the infamous uv / ir mixing problem ( see @xcite for reviews of the topic ) : new kinds of non - local ir divergences prevent the model from being renormalizable .",
    "in fact , so far only some modified scalar field theories on euclidean non - commutative spaces have been found to be renormalizable by adding new types of terms in the action .",
    "the first successful approach was introduced by grosse and wulkenhaar  @xcite , and proofs of renormalizability have been achieved mainly by utilizing multiscale analysis  @xcite , or formally in the matrix base  @xcite . recently , and quite independent of former developments , gurau _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced a term of the type @xmath1 into the lagrangian which modifies the theory in the infrared region and , in this way , renders it renormalizable .",
    "this was in fact proven to all orders by the authors using multiscale analysis .",
    "a thorough study of the divergence structure of this model ( referred to as @xmath2-model ) , including explicit renormalization at one - loop level  @xcite has been carried out as well as a computation of the beta functions  @xcite .",
    "the task of constructing a renormalizable non - commutative gauge theory is even more involved , and although there have been several interesting ideas using additional constraints  @xcite , or generalizing existing scalar models  @xcite , proofs of renormalizability are still missing .",
    "motivated by the inherent translation invariance and simplicity of the scalar @xmath2-model , a possible generalization to gauge theories was introduced in  @xcite and further discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the main idea was to include a gauge invariant non - local term in the action @xmath3 where the field strength tensor @xmath4 associated to the gauge field @xmath5 and the covariant derivative @xmath6 are defined by @xmath7 } , \\nonumber\\\\ & d_{{\\mu}}\\cdot = \\partial_{\\mu}\\cdot -{{\\rm i}g}{\\left [ a_{\\mu}\\stackrel{\\star}{,}\\cdot\\right ] } , \\qquad \\text{and}\\quad { \\varepsilon}{\\widetilde{d}}_{{\\mu}}={\\varepsilon}{\\theta}_{{\\mu}{\\nu}}d_{{\\nu}}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this model is formulated on euclidean @xmath8 with the moyal - deformed product @xmath9 } \\equiv   x_{\\mu } \\star x_{\\nu } -x_{\\nu } \\star x_{\\mu } = { { \\rm i}}{\\varepsilon}{\\theta}_{\\mu \\nu}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of regular commuting coordinates @xmath10 .",
    "the real parameter @xmath11 has mass dimension -2 , rendering the constant antisymmetric matrix @xmath12 dimensionless . in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : action_nloc ] ) , the non - local second term implements an ir damping mechanism similar to the one of the corresponding scalar model , but involves an infinite number of vertices in the action  @xcite .",
    "therefore , two alternatives of localizing that term by introducing additional fields were presented in  @xcite .",
    "initially the intent was to apply the technique of algebraic renormalization , however it turned out that this scheme may not be applicable to non - commutative spaces , as has been discussed recently in ref .",
    "the reason for these obstacles is that arbitrary powers of the gauge invariant dimensionless operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 may appear as counter terms in the effective @xmath15-loop action .",
    "in addition , these models suffer from a high degree of complexity due to a large number of ( ghosts and ) fields , being introduced in order to implement the demanded symmetries .",
    "finally , due to potentially divergent contributions by auxiliary fields , it is not clear if the models are at all renormalizable .",
    "the aim of the current work is to put forward an alternative action which implements the same - model . ] damping mechanism in the gauge field propagator in such a way , that the problems of the former models do not appear . in section",
    "[ sec : def_newmodel ] , we present the action of our new model and its ( symmetry- ) properties .",
    "we then discuss one - loop calculations including the respective renormalized propagator in section  [ sec : one - loop ] before explaining why we expect no ir problems in higher loop graphs in section  [ sec : higher - loops ] .    in the following",
    "we will use the abbreviations @xmath16 for vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 for matrices @xmath19 . for the deformation",
    ", we furthermore consider the simplest block - diagonal form @xmath20 for the dimensionless matrix describing non - commutativity .",
    "bearing in mind the problems of the previous approaches @xcite to the generalization of the scalar @xmath2 model to gauge theories , we now attempt to make a different ansatz . as a starting point",
    "we have to take into account that our action should meet the following requirements :    * the tree level action should provide a counter term for the quadratic ir divergence in the external momentum @xmath21 @xmath22 which appears at one - loop level in all versions of non - commutative gauge theories on @xmath23-deformed spaces .",
    "* all relevant propagators should be infrared finite and feature damping factors similar to the scalar @xmath24 model  @xcite . in this way , ir damping at higher loop orders is implemented without breaking translation invariance . *",
    "any auxiliary fields and related additional ghosts should be decoupled from the gauge sector , i.e. no according interactions should appear so that the physical content is not altered compared to traditional implementations of nc yang - mills theory  see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "* the model should be as simple as possible .",
    "the present idea is to discard the original approach of adding the non - local term of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : action_nloc ] ) , and instead to implement the damping entirely within a so - called ` soft - breaking ' term  a method well known from the gribov - zwanziger action  @xcite in qcd .",
    "let us discuss the most important steps leading to our new model .",
    "the starting point is the action proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which has been introduced in order to localize the operator @xmath25 appearing in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : action_nloc ] ) .",
    "that action consists of the usual yang - mills term @xmath26 plus the terms of below .",
    "the one proportional to @xmath27 represents the gribov - zwanziger soft breaking , and the second term implements the coupling between auxiliary fields and the gauge sector .",
    "our new proposal is derived in two steps :    [ eq : brss_constr_evol ] @xmath28\\label{eq : constr_step0}\\,,\\\\ \\phantom{\\text{step 1}}\\downarrow\\text{step 1}\\notag\\\\ { \\int\\!\\ ! { \\rm d}^4x}\\left[\\frac{\\gamma^3}{2}\\left(b_{{\\mu}{\\nu}}+{\\bar{b}}_{{\\mu}{\\nu}}\\right){\\frac{1}{{\\widetilde{\\square}}}}f_{{\\mu}{\\nu}}-{\\bar{b}}_{{\\mu}{\\nu}}d^2 b_{{\\mu}{\\nu}}\\right]\\label{eq : constr_step1}\\,,\\\\ \\phantom{\\text{step 2}}\\downarrow\\text{step 2}\\notag\\\\ { \\int\\!\\ ! { \\rm d}^4x}\\left[\\frac{\\gamma^2}{2}\\left(b_{{\\mu}{\\nu}}+{\\bar{b}}_{{\\mu}{\\nu}}\\right){\\frac{1}{{\\widetilde{\\square}}}}\\left(f_{{\\mu}{\\nu}}+{\\sigma}\\frac{{\\theta}_{{\\mu}{\\nu}}}{2}\\tilde{f}\\right)-{\\bar{b}}_{{\\mu}{\\nu}}b_{{\\mu}{\\nu}}\\right]\\,,\\label{eq : constr_step2}\\,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    with several new definitions to be explained subsequently .    to understand the first step we note that the divergences in the @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 propagators ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) are mainly caused by the appearance of the operator @xmath33 sandwiched between @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "on the other hand this term is crucial to the construction of the correct damping factor for the gauge boson propagator @xmath36 .",
    "a detailed analysis  @xcite of the interplay between terms in the action and the resulting propagators leads to the insight that it is possible to move one part ( @xmath37 ) of the problematic operator into the soft breaking term .",
    "aiming to eventually avoid couplings between auxiliary fields and the gauge sector , @xmath37 is furthermore replaced by is not a gauge invariant operator , but as we will discuss subsequently , brst invariance of the action will be guaranteed by additional sources . ]",
    "thereby , the desired damping is maintained while the ir divergences in the propagators of the auxiliary fields are eliminated .",
    "note also that the dimensionful @xmath11 has been absorbed into the new parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which have mass dimensions @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "in step 2 , we note that the regularizing effects are solely implemented in the bi - linear part of the action , therefore opening the option to reduce the field strength tensor @xmath4 in the soft breaking term to its bi - linear part @xmath43 noting furthermore , that the @xmath44 operator in the @xmath45 sector is not required any more for the implementation of the damping mechanism , we may entirely omit these covariant derivatives .",
    "consequently , the mass dimensions @xmath46 of the fields @xmath35 and @xmath34 change from 1 to 2 .",
    "any interaction ( represented by @xmath15-point functions with @xmath47 ) of @xmath5 with auxiliary fields and related ghosts is now eliminated .",
    "this represents the advantage that no additional feynman diagrams appear since the auxiliary fields only enter the bi - linear part of the action . finally , in order to implement a suitable term to absorb the @xmath48-contracted one - loop divergence ( see eqn .",
    "( [ eq : generic - ir - div ] ) and @xcite ) , we further modify the soft breaking part by the insertion of the term @xmath49 , resulting in .",
    "the new parameters @xmath40 and @xmath39 are intended to receive corrections in the renormalization process , as will be discussed in section  [ sec : renorm ] .",
    "obviously the motivation for the new breaking term is of purely technical nature since it simply allows to achieve the requirements we have imposed to the new model at the beginning of this section .",
    "physically , as has been discussed extensively in refs .",
    "@xcite , a soft breaking term in the action ( which should be understood as an additional gauge fixing as in the gribov - zwanziger case ) enables us to modify the behavior at low energy ( i.e. to damp ir divergences ) while not spoiling the symmetries of the theory in the uv .",
    "this should be understood as an additional gauge fixing as in the gribov - zwanziger case .",
    "however , the freedom in the choice of this soft breaking is not yet entirely understood . clearly , due to the uv / ir mixing problem , a non - commutative gauge field model only has the chance to be renormalizable with this or a similar additional ir modification .",
    "this is inherently different from the well - known yang - mills theory on commutative space and of course requires further investigation in the future .    in view of these considerations ,",
    "the following brst invariant action formulated in euclidean @xmath8 is put forward : @xmath50=\\nonumber\\\\ * & = { \\int\\!\\ ! { \\rm d}^4x}\\bigg[\\!\\!\\left(\\bar{j}_{{\\mu}{\\nu}{\\alpha}{\\beta}}b_{{\\mu}{\\nu}}+j_{{\\mu}{\\nu}{\\alpha}{\\beta}}\\bar{b}_{{\\mu}{\\nu}}\\right)\\!{\\frac{1}{{\\widetilde{\\square}}}}\\!\\left(f_{{\\alpha}{\\beta}}+{\\sigma}\\frac{{\\theta}_{{\\alpha}{\\beta}}}{2}\\tilde{f}\\right)\\",

    "this will also apply to the rest of our paper .",
    "the non - commutative generalization of a @xmath52 gauge field is denoted by @xmath5 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the ( anti-)ghosts and the multiplier field @xmath55 implements the landau gauge fixing @xmath56 . @xmath57 and @xmath58 are external sources introduced for the non - linear brst transformations @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which will be defined shortly .",

    "this allows us to use ordinary derivatives instead of inverse covariant derivatives which need to be localized by auxiliary fields and ghosts in order to be interpreted in a reasonable way .",
    "thereby , the gauge field @xmath177 is completely decoupled ( in terms of interactions ) from the new auxiliary fields , and respective quantum corrections reduce ( diagrammatically ) to the ones known from the nave non - commutative ym and qed theories  @xcite . *",
    "the tree level action features terms @xmath178 , with powers @xmath179 being designed to absorb all types of divergences appearing at one - loop level . from transversality with respect to external momenta , dimensional considerations , and power counting , one can derive that these , in fact , are the only ir divergent tensor structures appearing in the corrections .",
    "explicit one - loop computations showed the expected results .",
