    "during the last two decades the amount of information transmitted via optical fiber communication systems has increased enormously .",
    "high performance of modern communication lines is provided by an optical fiber @xcite , where the information is encoded and transmitted as a sequence of light pulses . despite the very high data rate achieved today ( @xmath0 50 tb / s over single fiber )",
    ", there is urgent demand for even more capacity of the fiber line , originating from the needs of telecommunications and the internet .",
    "different approaches are being pursued to address the capacity problem , such as improving the transmission properties of the optical fiber , lying additional parallel cables and using the information coding schemes going beyond the binary format , which is currently employed . among the above mentioned approaches using the extended alphabet , where a bound state of two or more optical solitons called _ soliton molecule _",
    "serves as a new carrier of information unit @xcite , seems to be most appealing because it employs already existing optical fiber lines , and therefore is beyond the competition from the viewpoint of cost - effectiveness .",
    "it is appropriate to recall that solitons are self - localized wave packets that can propagate along wave - guides preserving their shape and velocity , and exhibit particle - like collisions with each - other .",
    "bright solitons emerge from the fine balance between the dispersive broadening and nonlinear self - focusing of the wave packet .",
    "when the optical soliton was theoretically predicted @xcite and experimentally observed @xcite , there was a promising idea that it can be used as information carrier in optical fiber communication systems @xcite due to its exceptional robustness against perturbations . besides",
    ", the nonlinearity of the optical fiber , considered to be nuisance in linear systems , has been used as an advantage in this case as it provides the soliton s self - healing property . however , some other detrimental effects like four - wave mixing and gordon - haus timing jitter @xcite have imposed difficulties for the progress in this direction",
    ". later the concept of dispersion - management ( dm ) and dm soliton was put forward ( for a recent review see @xcite ) , which allowed to suppress these adverse effects , and eventually has led to realization of several commercial soliton based optical fiber communication systems .",
    "an interesting chronicle of the growth of the telecommunications industry , including the fiber optic systems , is given in ref .",

    "recent progress in using solitons for information transfer is linked to the observation , that solitons in dm fibers can form stable bound states called soliton molecules , and realizing their potential for enhancing the capacity of the communication system via extension of the coding alphabet @xcite .",

    "the proof - of - principle demonstration of the data transmission via optical fiber using the extended alphabet : logical _ zero _ , _ one _ ( single soliton ) , _ two _ ( two - soliton molecule ) and _ three _ ( three - soliton molecule ) , was recently reported in @xcite .",
    "the practical implementation of this novel approach requires extensive research on the existence regimes , stability , mutual interactions and propagation dynamics of soliton molecules in dm fibers .    in this work",
    "we study the existence regimes and dynamics of soliton molecules in dm fibers by analytical and numerical means .",
    "first we develop a variational approach ( va ) to find the stationary shape of the molecule and equilibrium separation between solitons in the molecule . at this stage",
    "we obtain two coupled ordinary differential equations ( ode ) for the temporal separation between solitons and chirp parameter , which describes the fast dynamics of the molecule within a unit cell of the dm fiber .",
    "although the derived ode system is capable of describing the propagation of the molecule for arbitrary distance , long - haul transmission of dm solitons and molecules is convenient to explore using the averaged nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) .",
