    "in compounds that contain transition metal , lanthanide , or actinide ions with partially filled @xmath11- or @xmath12 -electron shells , the strong electronic correlations originating in the hybridization of localized @xmath11- or @xmath12 -electron and conduction electron states often leads to the emergence of new electronic ground states such as heavy fermion metals , complex magnetic order , quadrupolar order , non - fermi - liquid ( nfl ) behavior , and unconventional superconductivity ( sc ) @xcite .",
    "the search for and the understanding of novel electronic ground states thus is an important research direction in the study of strongly correlated electron phenomena .",
    "a prime example of such emergent behavior is the `` hidden - order '' ( ho ) phase in the heavy fermion compound uru@xmath0si@xmath1  that occurs below @xmath13 = 17.5 k and coexists with sc below @xmath14 = 1.5 k  @xcite .",
    "neutron scattering experiments demonstrate the presence of a small antiferromagnetic moment @xmath15  @xmath4  0.01 - 0.04 @xmath5/u perpendicular to the tetragonal basal plane in the ho phase that is , however , much too small to account for the entropy of @xmath4 0.2rln(2 ) associated with the observed specific - heat anomaly  @xcite .",
    "recently , more detailed neutron scattering studies have , however , put forth the view that the magnetic structure in the ho phase is induced by strain  @xcite and is due to a small amount of the neighboring large moment antiferromagnetic ( lmafm ) phase that emerges at critical pressures @xmath16  @xmath17  0.5 - 1.5  gpa  @xcite .",
    "this led to the terminology ho  @xcite to allude to the unknown identity of the corresponding order parameter ( op ) that has eluded identification for almost three decades .",
    "notably , the search for the op of the ho phase has attracted an enormous amount of attention , and over the last few decades the full arsenal of experimental methods has been employed in the effort to unravel this notorious phase .",
    "this concentrated experimental effort has established that the presence of ho is reflected in many details of the complex electronic structure of uru@xmath0si@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "as originally inferred from the specific heat a charge gap of @xmath18  @xmath4  11  mev opens over about 40% in the fermi surface  @xcite .",
    "this is also evident from the large jump observed in the hall coefficient @xmath19 at @xmath13 that indicates a reduction of charge carrier concentration @xmath20 from 0.10 holes per u atom in the paramagnetic state to 0.02 in the ho phase  @xcite and measurements of the optical conductivity  @xcite .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering has further revealed that a spin gap opens simultaneously with the charge gap . here",
    "a spin gap is observed both at the commensurate wave vector @xmath21 , as well as the incommensurate wave vector @xmath22 , where the values of the corresponding gaps are 2 and 4  mev , respectively  @xcite . above @xmath13",
    "the @xmath23 mode transforms to weak quasielastic spin fluctuations , where wiebe _ et al . _",
    "have shown that the gapping of these spin fluctuations accounts for the loss of entropy at the ho transition @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath24 mode is due to itinerant - like spin excitations that are related to the heavy electronic quasiparticles that form below a coherence temperature @xmath25  @xmath4  70  k.    further details have been revealed by investigations of the fermi surface ( fs ) of uru@xmath0si@xmath1 . here",
    "quantum oscillation measurements  @xcite have demonstrated that the fs in the ho phase of uru@xmath0si@xmath1  is mostly dominated by small closed pockets which is again in agreement with the partial gaping of the fs .",
    "moreover , measurements including angle - resolved phohto emission spectroscopy ( arpes )  @xcite , scanning - tunneling microscopy ( stm )  @xcite , and point - contact spectroscopy ( pcs )  @xcite have revealed that the electronic structure of uru@xmath0si@xmath1  is reorganized below @xmath13 where a heavy quasiparticle band shifts below the fermi level , and the crossing with a light hole - like band at @xmath26 leads to the formation of a hybridization gap @xmath27  =  5  mev .    in parallel with these extensive experimental efforts",
    "the ho problem has also motivated a wide range of theoretical studies , in particular because many of the electronic signatures of the ho phase are also relevant more broadly for strongly correlated electron systems in general . in turn a multitude of models to explain the ho phase and its elusive nature have been proposed ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein )",
    ". however , to date none of the models could be confirmed , often because the nature of the corresponding complex op can not be easily verified by means of current experimental methods .",
    "recent magnetic torque experiments suggest that the ho phase spontaneously breaks the rotational symmetry of the crystal in the [ 110 ] direction  @xcite . in combination with the absence of lattice distortions through the ho transition  @xcite , this suggests that the broken symmetry is solely of electronic origin .",
    "interestingly , this new experimental constraint rules out many previously proposed models for the ho phase ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and has induced a flurry of new theoretical proposals , such as dynamical symmetry breaking  @xcite , staggered spin - orbit coupling order  @xcite , spin - nematic states  @xcite , a rank-5 superspin  @xcite , and hastatic order  @xcite . here we focus on the latter two , which both propose a non - zero magnetic moment @xmath28 in the tetragonal basal plane  a prediction that can be experimentally tested via magnetic neutron diffraction .",

    "the proposed op breaks both time reversal symmetry and the lattice point group symmetry @xmath32 , consistent with the torque magnetometry results . for this op a small antiferromagnetic magnetic moment @xmath28 in the tetragonal basal plane oriented along the [ 110 ] direction ordered at a wave vector ( 0,0,1 )",

    "this clearly establishes that any sort of magnetic correlations for magnetic moments parallel to the tetragonal basal plane must be very short - range in nature , and that no long - range magnetic order with in - plane moments develops in the ho phase of uru@xmath0si@xmath1 .     as measured on the [ 100 ] magnetic bragg reflection",

    "we note that the absence of a static in - plane component of the magnetic moment @xmath2 may be explained in terms of a fluctuating in - plane component .",
    "this possibility was not investigated in detail in this work , because current models suggest a static magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "however , we note that because our experiment was carried out in the diffraction mode of bt-7 where the intensities are integrated over all final neutron energies after the scattering process at the sample , a fluctuating moment @xmath2 should have still led to some increased intensity at the [ 003 ] reciprocal space position if both the moment and the lifetime of the fluctuations were large enough .",
    "if the lifetime of the fluctuations were short or the fluctuating moment was very weak , only an energy - resolved neutron scattering experiment would be able to detect an in - plane fluctuating moment .",

    "the presence of this parasitic phase would decrease the volume fraction of the ho phase , and therefore the size of a possible in - plane component @xmath2 .",
    "however , comparing the measured moment in the lmafm phase of 0.5 @xmath5/u with the known size of @xmath3  @xmath4  0.01 - 0.04 @xmath5/u in the ho phase , one estimates that the parasitic lmafm phase would be less than 8% . for high quality samples such as the one used for this study it should be even smaller .",
    "therefore , we conclude that a possible parasitic character of @xmath3 does not influence the upper bound for @xmath2 significantly .",

    "we therefore argue that a small sample mosaic typical for a high quality sample is useful for detecting small magnetic moments .",
    "we also consider the influence of magnetic domains on the limit provided for @xmath2 .",
    "uru@xmath0si@xmath1  crystallizes in the tetragonal space group @xmath76 that does not contain any symmetry operations which may mix in - plane and out - of - plane components of the magnetic moment , and therefore , we limit our discussion to symmetry operations that transform the in - plane components @xmath77 of the magnetic moment . here",
    ", the four - fold rotation symmetry of the tetragonal basal plane will lead to four configuration domains for which the magnetic moments will be directed along @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "however , the selected measurement geometry ( cf . fig .  [ fig : magscattering](d ) ) probes all four domains simultaneously , and the total magnetic intensity at the probed reciprocal space positions [ 001 ] and [ 003 ] is the sum of the individual intensities for each domain .",
    "thus , the presence of magnetic domains does not influence our result .",
    "in conclusion our measurements provide an experimental upper limit for the size of the theoretically predicted component @xmath2 of the antiferromagnetically ordered static magnetic moments in the ho phase of the heavy fermion system uru@xmath0si@xmath1 .",
