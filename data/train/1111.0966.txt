    "while the nature of the explosion that leads to a type ia supernova ( sn ia)detonation , deflagration , or both and the process that leads to the explosion trigger are not well known , it is commonly assumed that an sn ia is powered by the explosion of a white dwarf ( wd ) at a pressure and temperature sufficient to ignite carbon @xcite .",
    "all viable sn ia models of the _ progenitor system _ include a companion ( secondary ) star that transfers mass ( either steadily or violently ) to the wd @xcite .",
    "single - degenerate channels involve transfer of mass from a giant , main sequence , or helium star .",
    "double - generate channels involve the merger of two wds @xcite .",
    "there is considerable _ circumstantial _ evidence that the primary is a c+o wd @xcite , but until recently ( @xcite ; see also @xcite for a similar analysis ) there have been very few direct constraints .",
    "the evidence is ( 1 ) neither hydrogen nor helium is seen in sne ia @xcite , and few astrophysical objects lack these elements , ( 2 ) the elements synthesized in sn ia are consistent with the fusion chain leading from carbon going up to the iron peak , ( 3 ) degenerate objects can result in runaway , explosive burning , ( 4 ) the energy gained from burning a wd matches that seen in a sn ia , ( 5 ) simulations of the explosions of co wd stars are successful at reproducing sn ia spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the discovery of a class of sne ia that require a wd mass above the chandrasekhar limit @xcite has caused some to question whether a wd is involved in the explosion after all @xcite .",
    "a normal sn ia , , was discovered in the pinwheel galaxy ( m101 ) more than two weeks before it hit maximum brightness on 12 sept 2011 ut @xcite . to date ,  provides some of the best constraints on the progenitor system of an sn ia : coupled with a well - measured distance modulus to m101 ( dm=29.05 @xmath7 0.23 mag ; @xcite ) , the non - detection of a quiescent counterpart at optical , infrared , mid - infrared and x - ray wavebands were used to placed strict limits on the nature of the progenitor system . with optical imaging reaching @xmath8100 times",
    "fainter than previous limits , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite showed that roche - lobe overflow red giants as the secondary star were excluded ; he - star + wd progenitor systems were also largely excluded .",
    "@xcite placed constraints on double - degenerate models based on the non - detection of early - time emission from shock interaction with the disrupted secondary wd material @xcite .    rather than focus on the progenitor system as a whole , in this _",
    "letter _ we investigate what can be gleaned about the primary star , the body directly responsible for powering the sn .",
    "@xcite have previously noted that the primary size was small ( @xmath9 ) based on considerations of the early - time light curve .",
    "they concluded , based also on carbon and oxygen observed in the early - time spectra , that a c+o wd was the likely primary .",
    "here , coupling a new , more stringent radius measurement and explicitly discussing mass constraints ( based on explosive yield ) and temperature constraints ( from quiescent non - detection ) we narrow the parameter space for the primary even further . whereas the @xcite radius constraint was insufficient to rule out carbon - burning main sequence stars ,",
    "our results appear to exclude such bodies . by process of elimination",
    ", we find that a wd ( or a neutron star ) are the only allowable primary candidates .",
    "as a manifestly `` normal '' sn ia ( spectroscopically and in peak brightness ) ,  is expected to show the characteristic decline of the half - life of the radioactive process @xmath1co@xmath10fe , which in turn suggests at least @xmath11 of synthesized @xmath1ni powered the early light curve @xcite .",
    "we thus consider @xmath12 as a conservative lower limit to the mass of the primary ; this value is below the lower mass limit ( @xmath13 ) for sub - luminous sn ia models @xcite . while a chandrasekhar mass , @xmath14 is typically invoked for the primary , there are no stringent upper limits on the primary mass . to accommodate so - called super - chandrasekhar events ,",
    "we thus consider a conservative mass range for the primary is @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "the earliest observations of  can be used to constrain the radius of the primary star .",
    "the detection at what was determined ( from a remarkable several - day @xmath17 behavior of the optical light curve ) to be 11 hr post explosion , placed a constraint on the primary to be @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "starting about 7.5 hours before the ptf discovery image , we had fortuitously acquired a series of images of m101 , covering the position of  for one hour ; the data were obtained on pirate ( physics innovations robotic astronomical telescope explorer ) on the the open university s 0.4 m telescope in mallorca @xcite .",
    "we analyzed these images and found no significant excess flux at the sn location ( fig .",
    "[ fig : im ] ) .",
    "since the filter system was clear we translated the non - detection to a @xmath18-band magnitude equivalent under the assumption of a range of blackbody temperatures of the shock .",
    "for blackbody temperatures in the range 3000150000 k , we find a robust upper limit of @xmath19 mag at 5 @xmath20 ( at a mean time of @xmath21 hr post explosion ) .",
    "we use this new non - detection to constrain the primary radius under several different shock models .",
    "hr ( mid - point @xmath22 hr ) centered on the position of ; no significant flux at the sn position is detected .",
    "( bottom , left ) zoomed images near the sn position , showing , from left to right , a fake star with @xmath23 , 19.0 and 19.5 mag .",
    "the star was created using a postage stamp image of an isolated bright star on the stacked image with known sdss @xmath18-band magnitude and a color consistent with @xmath24 k. a shock with @xmath25 mag would have been marginally detected .",
    "the compact source labelled `` a '' is sdss j140306.16 + 541706.5 , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "( bottom , right ) same as at left , but using a known sdss star with @xmath28 k. a shock with @xmath29 mag would have been marginally detected.,width=307 ]    initially , the explosion shock wave deposits radiation energy throughout the stellar envelope , which subsequently diffuses out and contributes to the supernova brightness . because the radiation energy is lost to adiabatic expansion after the explosion",
    ", the luminosity from shock heating depends on the initial stellar radius .",
    "a number of analytical models for the early luminosity have been constructed under the assumption of spherical symmetry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the studies differ in their assumptions of e.g. , the initial ejecta density and pressure profiles , the nature of the opacity , and in the treatment of radiative diffusion .",
    "nevertheless , the predicted early light curves tend to be quite similar , and have been found to agree with numerical calculations to within a factor of @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite find analytic expressions for the luminosity and effective temperature : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the progenitor radius @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the explosion energy @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the mass in units of @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the opacity @xmath39 .",
    "these expressions assume a constant opacity , which is appropriate when electron scattering dominates in fully ionized c / o ejecta .",
    "the form factor @xmath40 depends on the density profile of the primary star , and has estimated values in the range @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "we constructed theoretical light curves of the early optical luminosity assuming the spectrum was given by a blackbody with @xmath43 , and the flux at the effective wavelength of the filter ( given the temperature ) was consistent with the non - detection .",
    "figure  [ fig : lc ] shows the results for a selection of different analytical models , assuming @xmath44 ( constant explosive yield per unit mass ) , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and a variety of values of @xmath0 .",
    "the pirate observation at 4  hours is the most constraining data point , which limits @xmath47 .",
    "table  1 summarizes the detailed radius constraints under different assumptions of progenitor mass and under the different models .",
    "the expressions we have used for the early luminosity hold only under the assumption that radiation energy dominates in the post - shock ejecta .",
    "in fact , the diffusion wave will eventually recede into higher density regions of ejecta where gas pressure dominates .",
    "the luminosity is then expected to drop suddenly ; @xcite show that , for constant opacity , the time of this drop is proportional to @xmath0 , which effectively limits the minimal progenitor radius that we are capable of probing . from their expression for @xmath48",
    "we find this minimal radius to be @xmath49 where @xmath50  hours .",
    "the value of @xmath51 is just smaller than our limits on @xmath0 determined in table  1 , suggesting that the breakdown of radiation energy domination is not likely to undermine our results .",
    "the early photometry of  also tightly constrain the nature of a possible companion star .",
    "the interaction of the supernova ejecta with a companion star produces emission which depends linearly on the separation distance ( kasen 2010 ) .",
    "this emission will be anisotropic and vary by a factor of @xmath52 depending on the orientation . assuming the companion star in roche lobe overflow , such that its radius is @xmath53 of the separation distance , and that the observer s viewing angle is unfavorable ( such that the light curve is fainter by a factor of 10 from its maximum ) our data restricts the companion star radius to @xmath6 . unless the time since explosion for the pirate data is vastly underestimated ( by @xmath54 day ) , this apparently excludes roche - lobe overflowing red giant and main sequence companions to high significance .",
    "non - detection discussed in  [ sec : rad ] and the first two detections from ptf @xcite .",
    "the black line shows the @xmath55 behavior of the early - time light curve detected in ptf , consistent with the non - detection . for the kasen ( 2010 ) companion interaction model , @xmath56 denotes the separation distance between the two stars , and the light curve is shown for an observer aligned with the collision axis , which produces the brightest observed luminosity.,width=336 ]    _ temperature - radius _ : non - detections of a quiescent counterpart in hubble space telescope ( hst ) imaging yield a specific luminosity ( @xmath57 ) constraint at certain optical frequencies . with the assumption of a spectrum of the primary , these limits can be turned into a limit on the bolometric luminosity ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "@xcite considered mostly spectra of an unseen secondary , using model input spectra of red giants to derive @xmath58 constraints . for a high effective temperature primary , here we consider a blackbody as the input spectrum and solve for the bolometric luminosity and effective radius using stephan - boltzmann law ( see also @xcite for a similar analysis ) .",
    "we perform a similar analysis with the chandra x - ray non - detection , convolving different input blackbody spectra to find a radius limit . at @xmath59",
    "k , for example , the limits ( 1,2 , and 3 @xmath20 ) are @xmath60 @xmath61 , @xmath62 @xmath61 , and @xmath63 @xmath61 .    in figure",
