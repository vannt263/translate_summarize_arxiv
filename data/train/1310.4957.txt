    "string theory is perhaps the best studied candidate theory for physics beyond the standard model of particles .",
    "still , its mathematical richness is far from being fully tapped . in this work ,",
    "we examine the relation between nonlocality and extended objects , in particular the string . depending on the context in which it arises ( free or interacting string )",
    ", nonlocality affects the way in which an observer would perceive both a propagating string and the dimensionality of spacetime .    in systems defined in continuous spacetimes ,",
    "_ nonlocality _ is the appearance of an infinite number of derivatives in the kinetic terms @xmath0 of fields or , what is equivalent @xcite , by interactions @xmath1 dependent on noncoincident points .",
    "string theory is not formulated on spacetime but its very nature makes it nonlocal .",
    "imagining strings to evolve in a predetermined spacetime can help to intuitively understand why .",
    "when strings propagate , their trajectories are not one - dimensional worldlines but two - dimensional worldsheets , which are strips for open strings and tubular surfaces for closed strings .",
    "when strings meet , their interactions are not pointwise but extended to a finite region of space ; this feature is at the core of the ultraviolet ( uv ) finiteness that the theory is believed to have .",
    "the string is nonlocal also in the quantitative sense of its field - theory limit @xcite , since the particle - field content of the string spectrum evolves according to the nonlocal operators [ fp ] f()~^-c , where @xmath2 is the laplace  beltrami operator , @xmath3 runs from 0 to @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a constant , and @xmath6 is the regge slope .",
    "this form factor arises in string field theory ( sft @xcite ) , from the way in which open strings interact ; after a field redefinition , the nonlocality in interaction terms is transferred to the kinetic terms which then take the form of ( [ fp ] ) .",
    "the closed - string case gives the same @xmath7 but with @xmath8 . in turn , the solutions of string - field equations are given by the superposition of a one - parameter family of states in a conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "these ` surface states ' obey a universal diffusion - like equation where diffusion time is the parameter of the family and the spatial generator ( i.e. , what would be the laplacian in ordinary space ) is a combination of virasoro operators .",
    "this structure filters from the conformal - field - theory formulation down to the spacetime limit of the system to give the exponential form factor ( [ fp ] ) @xcite .    in general",
    ", nonlocal operators are troublesome . on one hand ,",
    "the cauchy problem can be ill defined or highly nonstandard @xcite , since it would entail an infinite number of initial conditions @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ,  , representing an infinite number of degrees of freedom . as the taylor expansion of @xmath12 around @xmath13 is precisely given by the full set of initial conditions , specifying the cauchy problem would be tantamount to knowing the solution itself @xcite .",
    "this makes it very difficult to find analytic solutions to the equations of motion . on the other hand , a particle interpretation of a quantum field theory",
    "may even be absent , due to the replacement of poles in the propagators with branch cuts @xcite .",
    "moreover , causality may be violated at microscopic scales @xcite",
    ". however , the type of nonlocality ( [ fp ] ) found in sft ( or with form factors @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is an entire function @xcite ) is far more benign than it was earlier deemed @xcite .",
    "the entire function @xmath16 introduces neither extra poles ( as in ghost - plagued theories with derivatives of higher but finite order @xcite ) nor branch cuts @xcite .",
    "also , the cauchy problem can be reformulated in such a way that the infinite number of degrees of freedom , so characteristic of nonlocal theories , is absorbed into suitable field redefinitions via perturbative @xcite and nonperturbative techniques @xcite .",
    "causality , too , is respected in theories with exponential operators , both at the microscopic and at the macroscopic level @xcite .",
    "all this is somewhat reassuring , as the same conformal structure leading to equation ( [ fp ] ) is responsible for the uv finiteness of string theory .",
    "nonlocal theories were recognized early as describing physical entities which are not pointwise @xcite .",
    "an example is nonlocal electrodynamics , where the electron becomes a spherical charge distribution of finite radius @xcite .",
    "similarly , the exponential form factors appearing in a class of super - renormalizable theories of gravity @xcite may be conjectured to be a manifestation of underlying extended objects . in general ,",
    "` nonlocality ' is tightly related to the appearance of ` extended objects ' , but a precise connection between these two concepts is still lacking .",
    "it is our purpose to clarify such an issue both in nonlocal theories and , especially , for the string case , giving it a precise physical meaning in terms of the resolution of the string worldsheet .    instead of starting from sft and the form factor ( [ fp ] ) , it is more instructive to discard interactions and consider the _ free _ string . in 1990",
    ", kato showed that a quantized particle with a certain nonlocal kinetic term reproduces the spectrum of open bosonic free string and the veneziano amplitude @xcite . within the same model ( reviewed and clarified in section [ sec2 ] ) , we will show that the trajectory of the classical particle is two - dimensional in the uv , that is , a worldsheet ( section [ sec3 ] ) .",
    "thus , the physical meaning of the relation between kato s model and open bosonic string theory is improved , but we will also be able to comment on the closed - string case and on strings attached to branes ( section [ sec4 ] ) .",
    "all the information we need is in the bosonic sector , so we ignore supersymmetry .",
    "the polyakov action for the open bosonic string is ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; here @xmath17 ) [ poly ] = _ -^+ _ 0^(_x__x^-_x__x^ ) , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are coordinates parametrizing , respectively , the ( infinite ) length and the ( finite ) width of the worldsheet , @xmath20 are @xmath21 scalars , and greek indices are contracted with the minkowski metric @xmath22 .",
    "we gauge fixed the worldsheet metric to the flat one by combining worldsheet diffeomorphisms and a weyl transformation .",
    "the equation of motion proceeding from ( [ poly ] ) is [ steom ] ( -_^2 + _",
    "^2 ) x^=0 . to solve it",
    ", one should specify a set of boundary conditions .",
    "for the free open string , these would be the neumann boundary conditions @xmath23 . plugging the solution back into the action ( [ poly ] )",
    ", one would trivially get @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a constant ( not necessarily finite ) boundary term .",
    "in fact , for any solution @xmath26 of ( [ steom ] ) ( integration domains omitted ) , 2&= & _ x^_sol_x^_sol|_=-^=+-_x^_sol_x^_sol|_=0^= + & & - _",

    "however , we want to obtain a _ nontrivial _ effective action for the string in the limit where its length can be ignored , so that one can treat it as a particle . to perform this zooming out correctly",
    ", one should integrate the degrees of freedom along the string length , but this is not possible if we specify the neumann conditions on both endpoints of the string .",
    "therefore , we must define one of the endpoints by a generic dirichlet boundary condition ) will not depend on the choice of the endpoint , thanks to the reparametrization invariance @xmath27 .",
    "] , plug the corresponding solution @xmath28 back into equation ( [ poly ] ) , and integrate over the length parameter @xmath29 . the resulting effective action @xmath30 $ ] will encode the degrees of freedom we are looking for .",
    "they will correspond to a ` particle ' , but not in the usual sense of a pointwise object with local dynamics .",
    "let us see this procedure in detail .",
    "we fourier transform @xmath31 in the worldsheet coordinate @xmath18 : x^ ( , ) & = & _ -^+^kg(k,)x^(k),x^(k):=_-^+^-kx^(),[sol0 ] + x^ ( ) & : = & x^(,0),[xx ] where we singled out the fourier transform @xmath32 of the @xmath33 endpoint and @xmath34 is some kernel function determined by the boundary conditions . according to equation ( [ xx ] ) and imposing only @xmath35 , [ cong ] g(k,0)=1,_g(k,)|_==0 .",
    "applying equation ( [ steom ] ) to ( [ sol0 ] ) , we get @xmath36 , the harmonic oscillator with solution @xmath37 . the conditions ( [ cong ] ) require , respectively , that @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",

    "one would then obtain the usual free - string solution [ neu ] x_neu^=p^+_n^n(n)x^(n ) , which coincides with ( [ nsol ] ) when @xmath44 ( the integral is replaced by a sum ) and up to the linear term @xmath45 ( it has been added in ( [ neu ] ) as a part of the general solution , but it does not play any role in ( [ nsol ] ) and in what follows ) .    however , momenta @xmath41 are continuous since the function @xmath46 is not a cauchy datum .",
    "equation ( [ nsol ] ) represents a string with the @xmath47 endpoint free , not bound to any brane , and the other one unspecified . to give the solution ( [ nsol ] ) a physical meaning ,",
    "we plug it into the action ( [ poly ] ) and integrate over @xmath19 .",
    "one thus obtains an effective action for the endpoint coordinate @xmath48 , which is then interpreted as a worldline whose dynamics is characterized by a nonlocal form factor ( integration domains are omitted from now on ) : s & : = & -b |x__|x^|_=0= x _ ( ) ^kk(k)x^(k ) + & = & - x _ ( ) ^k(k)x^(k)= - x _ ( ) ( _ ) ^kx^(k ) + & = & - x _ ( ) ( _ ) x^(),[acf2 ] where [ ck ] ( k)=-(k)k,(_)=(_)_. for small momenta @xmath41 , @xmath49 and the action ( [ acf2 ] ) becomes that for a nonrelativistic point particle : [ popa ] ss_p=- x _ ( ) _ ^2 x^ ( ) . notice that this can also be regarded as a relativistic particle in the gauge of unit @xmath4-velocity , which can always be chosen by a worldline reparametrization @xcite . as the fourier transform of the hamiltonian @xmath50 from equation ( [ popa ] ) is proportional to @xmath51",
    ", the point particle can be regarded as the low - energy limit of the string .    even if the solution ( [ nsol ] ) is represented as an integral over continuous momenta @xmath41",
    ", the system possesses the conformal symmetry of the free string .",
    "classically , ( [ acf2 ] ) is required to be invariant under infinitesimal reparametrizations @xmath52 , where @xmath53 ( c.c",
    ".  stands for complex conjugate ) and @xmath54 is small .",
    "this implies that , if @xmath48 is solution to the equation of motion @xmath55 , then also @xmath56 is a solution , implying the constraint @xcite ( _ ) x^=0 ( _ + k)_x^=0 , which is satisfied by equation ( [ ck ] ) only if @xmath57 is an integer ( obviously , this range avoids poles in the @xmath58 function in ( [ nsol ] ) ) . by noether s theorem ,",
    "the conserved charges associated with this symmetry are @xcite l_n=12_-^^np_()p^ ( ) , where @xmath59 is the conjugate momentum .",
    "the @xmath60 obey the witt algebra @xmath61 , i.e. , a virasoro algebra with vanishing central charge .",
    "the infinite countable number of modes of the string are all contained in the operator @xmath62 .",
    "let us define the nonlocal operator @xmath63 ( using the notation of @xcite ) such that @xmath64 .",
    "after integrating by parts , the action ( [ acf2 ] ) is rewritten as [ acff ] s=12(_x_)f_0 ( _ ) _ x^. the inverse operator @xmath65 admits the series representation [ sef ] = 1 + 2_n=1^+ , which can be used to recast @xmath66 as an infinite superposition of modes : [ modes ] x^()=x_0^()+2_n=1^+x_n^ ( ) , where x_0^:=f_0 ( _ ) x^,x_n^:=f_0 ( _ ) x^. up to a total derivative , the action ( [ acff ] ) reads @xcite s=12_. upon quantization , the model ( [ acf2 ] ) turns out to be unitary with positive semidefinite hamiltonian @xmath67 .",

    "the generators @xmath72 obey the virasoro algebra @xmath73=(m - n)\\hat l_{m+n}-(c/12)m(m^2 - 1)\\de_{m+n,0}$ ] . therefore , the infinite number of degrees of freedom encoded in the nonlocal action ( [ acf2 ] ) are nothing but the open bosonic string spectrum .",
    "the nonlocal model realizes the same fock space of physical states of the full theory .",
    "to summarize so far , the action ( [ poly ] ) gives rise to a nonlocal model for a particle when considering the system at a lower resolution , i.e. , when looking at the string sufficiently far away to lose the perception of it as an extended object .",
    "in the next section , we will render the zooming - out resolving procedure and the meaning of ` sufficiently far away ' quantitative .",
    "equation ( [ acf2 ] ) represents a particle but with a peculiar type of dynamics , such that it can not be really treated as a ` point ' .",
    "the construction of section [ sec2 ] has been carried out in @xcite , while here we have improved its physical interpretation .",
    "we further do so in the following , showing how the action ( [ acf2 ] ) interpolates between a point particle in the infrared ( ir ) to a worldsheet in the uv .",
    "the transition will be uniquely determined by the string scale .",
    "to get acquainted with the necessary tools , it is instructive to have a short digression . to probe the geometry of a set , one can place a test particle on it and let it diffuse from some initial point .",
    "the diffusion clock is a length scale @xmath74 , whose inverse represents the resolution at which the process is studied .",
    "this interpretation is an improvement over the usual declaration that @xmath74 is an ` abstract diffusion time ' , which has no clear meaning when the set to probe is spacetime itself .",
    "thus , the diffusion equation is rather regarded as a running equation ( beta function ) .",
    "one typical context in which the diffusion approach is applied is quantum gravity , where spacetime geometry is deformed by quantum effects . in this case , diffusion is often governed by an equation of the form @xmath75p(x , x';\\ell)=0 $ ] , where @xmath76 is the probability density function of the process with initial point @xmath77 , and the integro - differential operator @xmath78 is determined by the effective dynamics of fields . in the absence of quantum - gravity effects , @xmath79 is the laplacian @xmath80 .",
    "moreover , diffusion on space and time is well defined only if the time direction is wick rotated to a euclidean configuration , lest the diffusion equation be parabolic .    here , unlike in standard applications of the diffusion equation in quantum gravity",
    ", we want to probe not the geometry of spacetime but _ the trajectory of the probe itself_.",
    "as we were unable to find instances in the literature where the diffusion equation was employed in this way , we assume the procedure to be unfamiliar to the general reader and take the ordinary particle ( [ popa ] ) as an example .",
    "this is a classical - mechanics system parametrized by one worldline dimensionless parameter @xmath81 and with kinetic operator @xmath82 . after carrying out the wick rotation @xmath83",
    ", one defines the diffusion equation on the worldline : [ dif1 ] ( -_^2)p[,;(l)]=0 , p(,,0)=(- ) , where @xmath84 , @xmath85 is a fixed reference length scale , and the initial condition at @xmath86 states that the probe is pointwise ( i.e. , it can detect individual points ) when the resolution @xmath87 is infinite .",
    "the solution ( normalized to 1 ) is a one - dimensional gaussian , @xmath88=\\exp[-(\\t-\\t')^2/(4l^2)]/\\sqrt{4\\pi l^2}$ ] .",
    "when @xmath89 , integrating in time and dividing by the divergent integral @xmath90 , one obtains the return probability @xmath91 , from which the _ spectral dimension _ descends : [ ds ] ( ) : = - . in this example , @xmath92 at all scales .",
    "its interpretation is straightforward and is one of the central tenets of the present paper : _ in classical mechanics , @xmath93 is the dimension of the trajectory of the particle_. here we have a standard point particle spanning a worldline , which is a one - dimensional set .",
    "the result @xmath92 is valid only at the classical level , where the particle trajectory is smooth .",
    "the path of a quantum particle ( in a classical spacetime ) is so irregular that it is nowhere differentiable @xcite and its hausdorff dimension is @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "here we calculated the spectral rather than the hausdorff dimension , but @xmath95 is expected for a quantum path anyway .",
    "let us now move to the nonlocal action ( [ acf2 ] ) .",
    "the diffusion equation ( [ dif1 ] ) is replaced by [ dif2 ] p=0,p(,;0)=(- ) , whose solution is p(,;)=^-(/_*)^2(k)^k(- ) , where @xmath96 .",
    "notice that @xmath97 and the diffusive process is well defined ( i.e. , it admits a probabilistic interpretation ) . in the ir limit @xmath98 ,",
    "the exponential is dominated by small momenta @xmath41 where @xmath99 , so one recovers the local particle case . recalling that this model stems from a zooming out from the free string ,",
    "the only possible choice for the scale @xmath85 is @xmath100 , which we set to 1 at the beginning .",
    "the spectral dimension ( [ ds ] ) is then [ dsel ] ( ) = 2 , and it is shown in figure [ fig1 ] . in the uv , @xmath93 tends to 2 . by itself",
    ", this would not be sufficient for concluding that the string worldsheet structure is recovered at small scales .",
    "in fact , there exist sets with integer dimension which are nonsmooth ( e.g. , the boundary of the mandelbrot set ) , while nonplanar geometries with @xmath101 occur in various quantum - gravity models .",
    "however , we also know @xcite that the model ( [ acf2 ] ) has a virasoro algebra and conformal symmetry , characteristics that no two - dimensional set except the worldsheet would possess . this concludes the proof of the main claim .",
    "the dimension of the path of the classical nonlocal particle ( [ acf2 ] ) . at uv scales @xmath102 , the structure of the string worldsheet becomes apparent.,width=340 ]    the profile of the spectral dimension provides a quantitative tool for zooming in to and out from the string . at scales",
    "@xmath102 , the extended nature of the string unfolds .",
    "we can give an intuitive explanation of why we retained continuous momenta instead of discrete ones in expressions such as ( [ nsol ] ) and ( [ dsel ] ) .",
    "the ordinary free string is endowed with a countable number of modes following from conformal invariance ; this invariance is manifest in the uv . on the other hand ,",
    "the effective theory ( [ acf2 ] ) is a limit of the full theory such that the infinite countable number of modes has been swept into a nonlocal operator ( equation ( [ sef ] ) ) and , at the same time , there exists an ir limit where conformal invariance is lost in the continuum of the point - particle reparametrization symmetry ) is trivial on the solution ( [ neu ] ) with neumann boundary conditions at both endpoints , @xmath103=b$ ] . for lagrangian systems , an expansion of the action around a field solution @xmath104 yields @xmath105=\\cs[\\phi_0]+\\delta^2 \\cs/\\delta\\phi^2|_{\\phi=\\phi_0}(\\phi-\\phi_0)^2/2+\\dots$ ] , where the first - order term vanishes by virtue of the equations of motion @xmath106 . inserting this in the path integral @xmath107 and ignoring the first contribution as a normalization",
    ", one interprets higher - order terms as a loop expansion . in systems such as the free string where @xmath108 $ ] is trivial , this expansion is purely quantum inasmuch as there are no surviving classical degrees of freedom , while the leading nontrivial term in the series is already at one - loop level . on the other hand , in the effective theory ( [ acf2 ] )",
    "the term @xmath108 $ ] is nontrivial and contains residual degrees of freedom . ] .",
    "in other words , the integral representation with continuous @xmath41 allowed for the possibility of quantitatively realizing the zooming in to and out from the string . this can be checked by replacing sums instead of integrals in the above expressions ( in particular , ( [ dsel ] ) ) and recalculating @xmath93 numerically : while the uv limit @xmath109 would be the same , the ir point - particle limit @xmath110 would not be recovered .",
    "the effective dimensionality of the string as encoded by equation ( [ ds ] ) has nothing to do with the various notions of _ spacetime _ dimension in string theory .",
    "the topological dimension @xmath4 of the target spacetime is simply the number of scalars @xmath111 , determined by the cancellation of the conformal anomaly .",
    "the spectral dimension of the target spacetime can be derived from the sft form factor ( [ fp ] ) and is more in line with traditional computations of @xmath93 where the probe is a field and the set to inspect is spacetime .",
    "the standard procedure is to consider the diffusion equation with the laplacian replaced by the wick - rotated form factor of the given field theory , in this case ( [ fp ] ) .",
    "the fact that this kinetic operator arises after a field redefinition of a system with ordinary kinetic term and interactions dressed with nonlocal operators should not be of concern .",
    "the diffusion equation method is essentially based on the free - field limit of the theory on the assumption that interactions do not contain derivative terms . in effective bosonic sft ,",
    "this is achieved precisely after the above - mentioned field redefinition , when interactions are made local and all nonlocality is transferred to the kinetic term . keeping nonlocal operators in the interaction terms would not account for all the dynamical effects of the system on the diffusion of the test probe .    using equation ( [ fp ] ) and imposing the diffusion equation ( with a pointwise initial condition ) p_target(x , x;)=0,p_target(x , x;0)=(x - x ) , where @xmath112 is wick - rotated , the solution as a momentum - space integral is p_target(x , x;)=^p(x - x ) , where @xmath113 .",

    "the spectral dimension of spacetime is then ^target()&=&- + & = & 2 . in the ir limit @xmath118 , the spectral dimension coincides with the topological dimension of the target spacetime , @xmath119 ; this can be seen directly from equation ( [ cptar ] ) , as the integral becomes independent of @xmath74 . in the uv",
    ", a numerical integration shows that ( figure [ fig2 ] ) [ sftds ] ^target0 .",
    "spectral dimension of the target spacetime in string field theory . in the ir limit ,",
    "the spectral and topological dimension coincide ( @xmath21 in this example ) , while in the uv limit the spectral dimension vanishes.,width=340 ]    the crucial point is that @xmath120 nonlocalities , when appearing in kinetic terms of field theories , erase the information on the structure of the probe .",
    "the operator @xmath16 naively gives rise to an extended object when applied to the initial condition , since @xmath121 is a gaussian of width @xmath122 @xcite , but this ` fattening ' of the source is completely negligible inside the exponential well created by the form factor , as one can see from the momentum kernel @xmath123 $ ] in the limit of large @xmath124 .",
    "thus , field theories with exponential operators ( including sft ) can only see point particles by construction ( consistently , the microcausality lightcone has a singular vertex @xcite ) , and equation ( [ sftds ] ) holds also for an extended source .",
    "however , in the case of string theory we have extra classical - mechanics information which allowed us to find the dimension of the probe itself rather than of its environment .",
    "although at high energy scales the spectral dimension ( [ sftds ] ) of spacetime vanishes , this result is insensitive of the intrinsic size of the probe , which we saw to be actually ( after euclideanization ) two - dimensional at energies comparable with the string tension ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "having @xmath125 with a source with undetermined structure means that the probe , whatever its details , does not diffuse in spacetime because it ` fills ' spacetime completely .",
    "therefore , a nondiffusing extended probe signals a spacetime of the same dimensionality , in this case 2 .",
    "the above results admit various generalizations .",
    "* _ closed string_. the effective nonlocal action is made up of two copies of equation ( [ acf2 ] ) ( representing the left - moving and right - moving sectors ) plus a constraint linear in the coordinates and identifying the zero modes of the copies @xcite .",
    "thus , the running of the spectral dimension is the same as for the open string , and the role of topology is negligible due to zooming - out effects .",
    "however , it is predominant in @xcite , where it was shown that , at high temperature , the thermodynamical dimension of the target spacetime is @xmath126 for closed strings and @xmath127 for open strings @xcite , where @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 are , respectively , the free energy , volume , and temperature of the system .",
    "the thermodynamical and spectral dimensions have been conjectured to be the same quantity for fractals @xcite , so one might expect that @xmath131 .",
    "however , both the speculative nature of this equivalence and the resolution limitations of the present approach prevent us from making a detailed comparison with the findings of @xcite .",
    "* _ dirichlet boundary conditions_. this case is more tricky , as it amounts to having at least one endpoint of the open string stuck at a d - brane . for instance , imposing the dirichlet condition @xmath132 on one endpoint , one gets @xmath133",
    ". however , the small - momentum limit yields a constant term plus a laplacian with wrong sign , @xmath134 , which signals a nonstandard local limit . after carrying out wick rotation",
    ", one can compute the spectral dimension as before , obtaining a running from 2 in the uv to infinity in the ir .",
    "this behaviour has no obvious diffusion interpretation , but understandably so : since the string is stuck at one endpoint , when zooming out from it one would see a still particle . * _ kato s family_. in @xcite , the operator ( [ ck ] ) was the @xmath135 element of the one - parameter family @xmath136 $ ] .",
    "it is easy to check that the spectral dimension of these models runs from 0 in the uv to 1 in the ir .",
    "when @xmath137 is sufficiently small , there is an intermediate peak larger than 1 , which increases to the value 2 and is pushed towards @xmath86 as @xmath138 decreases to zero . the nonlocal action ( [ acf2 ] ) with equation ( [ ck ] ) is the only one associated with a worldsheet geometry in the uv , as expected by the extreme rigidity of the conformal structure of string theory .    to summarize , via an explicit example we sharpened the relation between the extended scale - dependent nature of the fundamental degrees of freedom of nonlocal systems and the value of the spectral dimension",
    "it is not a new conjecture that the spectral dimension is a viable tool to use for understanding the meaning of form factors in nonlocal field theories , nor is it a new conjecture that the latter are associated , in general , with extended objects . in this paper",
    ", we presented a positive test result for both conjectures . in the example under inspection , we know that the theory at high energy is described by strings , while at low energy it is described by point particles .",
    "therefore , the effective dimension of the ( trajectory of the ) fundamental degree of freedom is 2 at high energy and 1 at low energy .",
    "although this sounds fairly obvious from any simple cartoon of the string when zoomed in to and out from , here we applied a novel method to make this dimensional flow under analytic control at any scale .",
    "the first advantage is having a clear - cut notion of what we mean by ` dimensionality of the degrees of freedom ' , scale by scale ; we achieved this through a resolution - changing probing of the string or , loosely speaking , by a ` probing of the probe ' .",
    "the interpolating theory is defined by a nonlocal action with a specific form factor .",
    "the second advantage is that , thanks to the inspection of the string - related nonlocal theory via a resolution - dependent tool , we have given more physical insight to the effective nonlocal model ( [ acf2 ] ) @xcite , which was lacking a concrete geometric interpretation .",
    "the third and last advantage is the clarification of how the more traditional notion of spectral dimension of spacetime ( i.e. , the environment in which the probe moves ) is affected by the intrinsic geometry as well as the topology of the probe .",

    "<S> we discuss an aspect of string theory which has been tackled from many different perspectives , but incompletely : the role of nonlocality in the theory and its relation to the geometric shape of the string . </S>",

    "<S> since there are no free parameters in free - string theory , the notion of large scales will be unambiguously determined . in other words </S>",
    "<S> , we will be able to answer the question : how and at which scale can the string be seen as a particle ? in doing so , we will employ the concept of spectral dimension in a new way with respect to its usual applications in quantum gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the operational notions of worldsheet and target spacetime dimension in string theory are also clarified and found to be in mutual agreement .    </S>",
