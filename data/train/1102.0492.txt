    "recently , hooper and goodenough examined the first two years of fermi gamma ray space telescope ( fgst ) data from the inner @xmath2 around the galactic center @xcite .",
    "they found that the gamma ray emissions coming from between @xmath3 and @xmath2 of the galactic center is consistent with what is expected from known emission mechanisms such as cosmic rays colliding with gas to produce subsequently decaying pions , inverse compton scattering of cosmic ray electrons , and known gamma ray point sources . in order to model the gamma ray background within @xmath4 of the galactic center , hooper and goodenough model the emission of the galactic black hole sgr a * as a power - law extrapolated from higher energy hess observations . comparing the fgst measurements to this background , hooper and goodenough found that it agrees very well with fgst data between @xmath5 but found an excess in the observed gamma ray intensity within @xmath6 .",
    "it has been pointed out by ref .",
    "@xcite however , that a simple power - law extrapolation of hess data may understate the flux of the central point source sgr a * as the slope of its spectrum may deviate from the constant hess results below an energy of  100 gev .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the increased gamma ray emissions are well described by annihilating dark matter that has a cusped halo profile ( @xmath7 , with @xmath8 to @xmath9 ) provided that the dark matter satisfies three basic conditions .",
    "the conditions required of the dark matter are 1 ) that it have a mass between @xmath10 gev , 2 ) that it annihilate into @xmath11-pairs most of the time , but into hadronic channels @xmath12 of the time , and 3 ) that its total annihilation cross section yield a thermal average within the range @xmath13 .",
    "it should be noted that the results of hooper and goodenough are controversial , and the fermi - lat collaboration itself has not yet published official results .",
    "in addition , other background related explanations for the gamma ray excess have been proposed such as the existence of a pulsar near the galactic center @xcite . in this paper",
    "we proceed with the assumption that the analysis of hooper and goodenough is correct",
    ". the astrophysical and particle physics implications of this finding are discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we construct a dark matter model satisfying the above conditions by adding a singlet to the supersymmetric leptophilic higgs model ( slhm ) @xcite . in the slhm",
    "the up quarks , down quarks , and leptons , each receive mass from a separate higgs doublet . for our purposes ,",
    "the salient characteristic of the slhm is that it endows the leptons with an enhanced coupling to one of the scalars .",
    "this provides a natural mechanism for dark matter particles to annihilate predominantly into @xmath11-pairs .",
    "this model of dark matter is able to successfully account for the fgst observations , yields the correct relic density , and evades relevant collider bounds such as measurements of the @xmath1 width and direct production at lep .",
    "the idea of a leptophilic higgs has been studied as a possible explanation for the @xmath14 excess observed by pamela and atic in ref .",
    "however , this entails a 100 gev - 1 tev dark matter particle , while our model requires a light , @xmath15 gev dark matter particle .",
    "there also exist some other models that can explain the galactic center gamma ray excess @xcite .",
    "in addition to explaining the fgst observations , such a model of light dark matter is also capable of describing observations by the cogent @xcite and dama collaborations @xcite .",
    "cogent has recently reported direct detection signals that hint at the presence of @xmath15 gev dark matter compatible with the light dark matter interpretation of dama s annual event rate modulation .",
    "@xcite showed that dark matter with a mass between @xmath16 gev that has a spin independent cross section approximately between @xmath17 is consistent with both cogent and dama signals .",
    "although the xenon @xcite and cdms @xcite collaborations challenge this report , ref .",
    "@xcite has pointed out that  zero - charge \" background events lie in the signal region .",
    "the authors suggest that the bound could possibly be loosened if a modest uncertainty or systematic error is introduced in the energy scale calibration near the energy threshold .",
    "although our model is able to explain the reported observations of the cogent and dama collaborations , it is not dependent upon their validity . by simply moving to another region of parameter space our model can coexist with the absolute refutation of cogent and dama while continuing to explain the fgst results and avoiding collider bounds .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the setup of the model and calculate the mass matrices for the scalars and the neutralinos . in section",
    "[ sec : annihilation ] we describe the process by which the dark matter annihilates into standard model particles and calculate the relevant cross sections for a benchmark point in parameter space .",
    "we also show that the resultant relic density is consistent with current cosmological measurements . in section [ sec :",
    "direct ] we discuss possible direct detection and in section [ sec : bounds ] we discuss relevant bounds for this model and show that it is currently viable .",
    "lastly , we conclude with section [ sec : conc ] and summarize the results of the paper .",
    "in this model the quark and lepton content is that of the mssm . to this we add four higgs doublets , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , with weak hypercharge assignment @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "the third higgs doublet is necessary to achieve a leptonic structure , while the fourth doublet is required for anomaly cancelation . in order to avoid problems with the @xmath1 decay width",
    ", we introduce a singlet @xmath24 that acts as @xmath25 gev dark matter .",
    "the idea of adding a light singlet to the mssm to act as dark matter was also considered in @xcite , while the use of a singlet for other purposes such as solving the @xmath26 problem was first developed in @xcite .",
    "the superpotential is given by @xmath27 where the hats denote superfields . in the superpotential we introduced a @xmath0 symmetry under which @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are odd while all other fields are even .",
    "the symmetry enforces a yukawa structure in which @xmath31 gives mass to up - type quarks , @xmath32 to down - type quarks , and @xmath29 to leptons , while @xmath33 does not couple to the quarks or leptons and is called the inert doublet .",
