    "as quantum computation finds wide applications today , the difficulty of implementing quantum computers also arises from the expense of qubits and their vulnerability to decoherence .",
    "therefore , quantum error correction and fault tolerant quantum computation have been extensively developed @xcite . among the most famous quantum error correcting",
    "codes are the [ 9,1 ] code @xcite , the css [ 7,1 ] code @xcite , and the [ 5,1 ] code @xcite .",
    "the encoding rate of these codes are much lower than classical codes due to the complicated nature of quantum decoherence .",
    "however , qubits are expensive , so it is desirable to have codes with higher rate .",
    "unfortunately , it has been shown that 1/5 ( encoding 1 qubit into 5 qubits ) is the highest rate for one - qubit code .",
    "in fact , quantum error correction codes satisfy the following quantum hamming bound @xcite : if an @xmath0 $ ] code ( encoding @xmath1 qubits into @xmath2 qubits ) can correct errors at at most @xmath3 qubits and there are @xmath4 independent possible errors in one qubit , then    @xmath5    it has been shown that if a code corrects all the errors in the pauli group generated by the pauli matrices operating on each qubit , then it can correct all types of errors @xcite .",
    "therefore , traditional quantum error correction has concentrated on the errors in the pauli group , and hence @xmath6 in . within this framework ,",
    "it is hard to improve the rate further .    however , not all the errors are equally likely in a realistic channel .",
    "if we assume some knowledge about the channel , such that only 1 or 2 independent errors are likely to occur in each qubit , then codes of higher rate can be obtained .",
    "indeed , an iterative optimization method to investigate channel - adapted codes has been proposed by @xcite and @xcite and a family of @xmath7 $ ] stabilizer codes , which correct all the first - order errors and some of the second - order ones in an amplitude damping channel , have been discovered by @xcite .",
    "the amplitude damping channel is the tensor product of one - qubit amplitude damping channels , each of which consists of the following two operator elements : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a parameter measuring the strength of the noise . here",
    "@xmath10 is pictured as an excited state and @xmath11 the ground state .",
    "@xmath9 is the probability of the transition from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "another important concept , nonadditive codes , was introduced in recent research @xcite seeking to find codes with higher rates than stabilizer codes . in these codes",
    ", the codewords do not form a subspace of @xmath12 and thus the dimension of the source space is not of the form @xmath13 .",
    "in other words , these codes encode a fractional number of qubits . to avoid confusion",
    ", we denote a ( nonadditive ) code which encodes a @xmath1 dimensional space into @xmath2 qubits by an @xmath14 code .",
    "this paper combines the ideas of channel adaption and nonadditive codes to find a new family of codes adapted to the amplitude damping channel which outperform the @xmath7 $ ] stabilizer codes in @xcite .",
    "the family of codes to be presented exploits self - complementary structure , which is crucial for correcting errors in the amplitude damping channel .",
    "self - complementary codes appear in different contexts @xcite and play different roles . to understand the significance of the structure , we analyze how errors arise and are corrected as follows .",
    "let @xmath15 be a quantum channel .",
    "the extent to which the channel preserves information is measured by the entanglement fidelity @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the input state . sometimes , we are more interested in the worst case performance , which corresponds to the minimum entanglement fidelity @xmath18 the restriction to pure states is justified in @xcite . in our case",
    ", @xmath15 is composed of the encoding operation @xmath19 , the amplitude damping channel @xmath20 and the recovery operation @xmath21 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath22 on @xmath9 suggests that the code be channel - adapted .",
    "the errors contained in @xmath23 , appropriately called the residual errors , can be divided into two classes .",
    "first of all , an error may flip a codeword @xmath24 to another codeword @xmath25 , like an @xmath26 operator acting on this two - dimensional subspace .",
    "we call this an @xmath26-like error . assuming no @xmath26-like errors ( up to a specific order ) , we may still have an error that causes damping or a phase shift ( or both ) of an off - diagonal entry : @xmath27 .",
    "different errors cause this problem , including the @xmath28 operator in the two dimensional space spanned by @xmath29 and @xmath30 . for simplicity ,",
    "we call these errors @xmath28-like errors .",
    "the following proposition shows that this list is exhaustive , up to the first order .",
    "[ xzerrors ] the code corrects all the first - order errors in the sense that @xmath31 if and only if @xmath23 do not contain any @xmath26-like errors or @xmath28-like errors to the first order .",
    "if @xmath23 contains an @xmath26-like error on @xmath29 or a @xmath28-like error on @xmath32 , then choose @xmath33 or @xmath34 , respectively , to show that @xmath35 contains a first - order term .",
    "conversely , assume that @xmath23 does not contain any @xmath26-like or @xmath28-like errors to the first order . call the underlying hilbert space @xmath36 , which is finite dimensional .",
    "then @xmath23 is a linear operator on @xmath37 , the space of the linear operators on @xmath36 . by the assumption",
    ", the entries of the matrix @xmath38 in the basis @xmath39 do not contain first - order terms , so @xmath40 .",
    "the conclusion follows from the continuity of @xmath41 and the compactness of the unit sphere in @xmath36 .",
    "consider an @xmath14 code .",
    "for a codeword @xmath42 , we denote by @xmath43 its complement such that @xmath44 for all @xmath45 .",
    "we call a code self - complementary , if the code is spanned by kets of the form @xmath46 .",
    "we define the inner product of two codewords @xmath47 and @xmath48 by @xmath49 and thus the hamming weight of @xmath47 is @xmath50 . by the definition of the amplitude damping channel , after passing through the channel , @xmath46 becomes @xmath51 let @xmath52 be the unit vector associated to @xmath53 , and @xmath54 be the unit vector in @xmath55 orthogonal to @xmath52 .",
    "it is thus reasonable to correct @xmath52 to the codeword @xmath46 .",
    "when we talk about self - complementary codes adapted to the amplitude - damping channels , we will always assume this recovery operation .",
    "now we will show that the self - complementary structure eliminates the @xmath28-like errors provided that the @xmath26-like errors have been eliminated .    [ sc ]",
    "let @xmath15 be the composite channel of a self - complementary code subject to an amplitude damping channel .",
    "if @xmath23 does not contain @xmath26-like errors to the first order , it does not contain @xmath28-like errors either .",
    "let @xmath56 denote the error vector such that @xmath57 . by the assumption ,",
    "if @xmath58 is in the code , then @xmath59 will be corrected fully to @xmath60 provided that @xmath61 since otherwise this results in a first - order @xmath26-like error .",
    "when @xmath62 , we agree that @xmath63 . now consider two codewords @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 .",
    "we have @xmath67\\\\ & = & \\frac{\\sqrt{((1-\\gamma)^{\\|u\\|^{2}}+(1-\\gamma)^{\\|\\bar{u}\\|^{2}})((1-\\gamma)^{\\|v\\|^{2}}+(1-\\gamma)^{\\|\\bar{v}\\|^{2}})}}{2}\\\\ & & \\times{\\left|w_{1}\\right\\rangle}{\\left\\langle w_{2 } \\right|}+\\frac{\\gamma}{2}(u\\cdot v+u\\cdot\\bar{v}+\\bar{u}\\cdot v+\\bar{u}\\cdot\\bar{v}){\\left|w_{1}\\right\\rangle}{\\left\\langle w_{2 } \\right|}+o(\\gamma^{2})\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2}(2-\\frac{\\gamma}{2}(\\|u\\|^{2}+\\|\\bar{u}\\|^{2}+\\|v\\|^{2}+\\|\\bar{v}\\|^{2})){\\left|w_{1}\\right\\rangle}{\\left\\langle w_{2 } \\right|}\\\\ & & + \\frac{\\gamma}{2}(u+\\bar{u})\\cdot(v+\\bar{v}){\\left|w_{1}\\right\\rangle}{\\left\\langle w_{2 } \\right|}+o(\\gamma^{2})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath68 , the conclusion follows .",
    "it is clear from theorem [ sc ] that a self - complementary code corrects all the first - order errors in an amplitude - damping channel if and only if no confusion arises assuming the decay occurs at no more than one qubit .",
    "more precisely , @xmath69 is such a code if and only if the set @xmath70 satisfies    ( s1)if @xmath71 , then @xmath72 ; and    ( s2)if @xmath73 and @xmath74 for some @xmath75 , then @xmath76 .",
    "the dimension of the code is @xmath77 .",
    "we use a greedy algorithm to search for maximal sets @xmath78 satisfied the above conditions for some small values of @xmath2 and the results are listed in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath79 column approximately indicates the number of qubits that can be encoded .",
    "linear regression yields that the slope of @xmath80 curve is 0.85 , which is higher than 0.5 as in @xcite .",
    "table 1 : encoded dimensions for small values of @xmath2    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we now describe the algorithm to generate the recovery operation .",
    "we use the maximum likelihood recovery .",
    "[ recovery]the error vectors refer to vectors in @xmath81 , where @xmath82 indicates a decay in that qubit .",
    "the error vectors are sorted by their weights and those with the same weight are sorted in the dictionary order .",
    "step 1 the first operator element of @xmath22 corrects @xmath52 in to @xmath46 .",
    "we are considering the error vector @xmath83 .",
    "step 2 put @xmath84 to be its successor and come to construct the next operator element of @xmath22 .",
    "step 3 find a word @xmath71 such as @xmath85 , which means that the decay @xmath84 may happen to @xmath47 , do the following :    step 3.1 if @xmath86 and both @xmath87 and @xmath88 have not appeared in @xmath22 except in the first operator element , then correct @xmath89 to @xmath46 .",
    "go to step 3.3 .",
    "step 3.2 if @xmath87 has not appeared in @xmath22 , then correct @xmath90 to @xmath46 .",
    "step 3.3 search for the next word @xmath71 with @xmath85 and go back to step 3.1 , until all the words in @xmath78 have been exhausted .",

    "we demonstrate the performance of our codes by a simple example , the ( 8,12 ) code , which encodes a 12 dimensional space to 8 qubits . in this case @xmath91",
    "the entanglement fidelity of this code on the ensemble @xmath92 is plotted and compared with the unprotected 3 qubits , since this code can encode at most 3 qubits .",

    "the code has an extremely high rate and thus may turn out useful in quantum computation and quantum teleportation . since the code is nonadditive , its decoding does not have the syndrome - diagnosis and recovery structure of the stabilizer codes , so we are concerned with designing the efficient quantum decoding circuits for these codes .",
    "it is also challenging to figure out the cardinality of @xmath78 satisfying ( s1 ) and ( s2 ) mentioned in the third section in a closed form or its asymptotic behavior .",
