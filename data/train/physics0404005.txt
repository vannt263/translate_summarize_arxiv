    "by contrast , the examples illustrated in this work have been chosen to be more general , and can also cover many particular cases . on the other hand , in the specific case of solids of revolution , only the mi with respect to the symmetry axis is usually reported .",
    "perhaps the most advantageous feature of the methods developed in this paper is that the three moments of inertia @xmath241  can be calculated by applying the same limits of integration , and we do not have to worry about the partitions .",
    "it is because all three moments of inertia are written in terms of the generating functions of the solid .",
    "for instance , any solid of revolution acting as a physical pendulum provides an example in which the mi with respect to an axis perpendicular to the axis of symmetry is necessary , an specific case is example [ bell ] for the gaussian bell ( see appendix [ ap : revexamp ] ) .",

    "finally , we point out that for solids of revolution in which densities depend only on the height of the solid , the expressions for the mi become simple integrals , such fact makes the integration process much easier .",
    "simple integrals are advantageous even in the case in which we can not evaluate them analytically . numerical methods to evaluate mi",
    "s utilize typically the geometrical shape of the body ; instead , numerical methods for simple integrals are usually easier to manage .    as for the technique of contour plots",

    "the contours are different but the modulation is of the same type , for example a cone and a pyramid has the same type of modulation ( scaling ) but their contours are totally different . in both situations",
    "we can save a lot of effort by making profit from the similarities .",
    "the reader can check the examples [ ex : contrunel ] , ex : pyrtrun and [ ex : genellip ] , in order to figure out the way in which we can exploit these symmetries in practical calculations .",
    "furthermore , textbooks always consider homogeneous figures to estimate the mi , assumption that is not always realistic . as for our formulae , though they simplify considerably when we consider homogeneous bodies , the methods are tractable in many cases when inhomogeneous objects are considered , allowing more realistic results .",
    "another interesting remark is that these methods can be used to calculate products of inertia in the case in which the complete tensor of inertia is necessary .",
    "moreover , expressions for the cm proceed by similar arguments , and the appendix [ ap : cm ] , shows some formulae for the cm of solids of revolution and solids built up by contour plots . in such expressions",
    "we realize that the same limits of integration defined for the calculation of the mi s are used to calculate the cm .",
