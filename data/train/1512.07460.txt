    "<S> are independent and are thought of as the left- and right - weyl fermion with helicity @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we study three orbital spin-1/2 weyl semimetals in the strong spin - orbital coupling limit with time reversal symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in this limit the systems can be a @xmath1 weyl semimetal or a @xmath2 semimetal , depending on the fermi level position . </S>",
    "<S> the latter near weyl points includes both degrees of freedom of rarita - schwinger - weyl and weyl s . a non - local potential separates the weyl and rarita - schwinger - weyl degrees of freedom and a relativistic rarita - schwinger - weyl semimetal emerges . </S>",
    "<S> this recipe can be generalized to mulit - weyl semimetal and weyl fermions with pairing interaction and obtain high monopole charges . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , a spatial inversion breaking raita - schwinger - weyl semimetal may also emerge . </S>"
