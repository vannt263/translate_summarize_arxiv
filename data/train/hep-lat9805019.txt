    "in spite of significant effort expended over the years@xcite , thermodynamic studies of lattice qcd with the wilson fermion action have been lagging behind those with the kogut - susskind action .",

    "one of the questions is how the continuum limit is to be taken with the new phase diagram .",
    "the parity - flavor broken phase has an extension which depends on the temporal lattice size , and the tuning of parameters necessary to achieve a continuum limit having chiral symmetry has not been explored in detail .",
    "another interesting question is how the phase diagram generalizes for finite quark chemical potential corresponding to finite baryon density . as is well known ,",

    "the model shares with qcd the feature of asymptotic freedom and spontaneously broken chiral symmetry .",
    "furthermore it is analytically solvable in @xmath0 expansion .",
    "these points make the model an useful arena for exploration of theoretical issues with lattice qcd thermodynamics with the wilson quark action .",
    "indeed the model has provided significant hints for understanding the structure of the finite - temperature phase diagram@xcite .    in the continuum the phase diagram of the gross - neveu model on the plane of temperature @xmath1 and fermion chemical potential @xmath2 was determined some time ago@xcite . in the leading order of @xmath0 expansion , the @xmath3 plane is divided into two phases , a chirally broken phase at low temperatures and small chemical potential and a symmetric phase at high temperatures and large chemical potential , separated by a phase boundary . along the phase boundary , the transition is of second order for small chemical potential , which however , changes into a first - order transition for large chemical potential .",

    "a more detailed study of the region near the point is clearly needed . as we shall see , the phase structure near the point is far more complex than would seem from fig .",
    "[ fig : mu0phase ] .",
    "an indication is a self - crossing behavior of the curve already visible for the central valley in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu0phase ] , which also occurs for the right and left valleys .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu0phasedet ] we plot an expanded view of the region near the tuned point @xmath115 ; we take @xmath116 for this figure as the structure is enhanced and so easier to draw .",
    "the thick curve represents the parity phase boundary , while the set of thin curves are lines of constant @xmath62 , as determined from ( [ 124]-[125 ] ) , for @xmath117 in steps of 0.02 .",
    "a number of important features are revealed in this figure .",
    "first of all , the boundary curve crosses with itself at the point b ( this point differs from the tuned point @xmath115 marked by a cross , to be discussed below ) . to understand why the crossing takes place , we note that the right - hand side of ( [ 121 ] ) behaves as @xmath118 near @xmath119 . hence ( [ 121 ] ) regarded as an equation of @xmath61 for a given @xmath79 has three solutions in the neighborhood of @xmath120 , leading to the self - crossing behavior .",
    "since the existence of three solutions is valid for arbitrarily small values of @xmath37 , the crossing persists down to @xmath108 .",
    "quite clearly there is no guarantee that the boundary curve represents the true phase boundary below the crossing point .",
    "another important feature is that the lines of constant @xmath62 spill beyond the boundary curve to the right of the crossing point . in the triangular region dbe formed by the two segments of the boundary curve",
    "db - be and the envelope ed of lines of constant @xmath62 , the saddle point equations ( [ 124]-[125 ] ) have three solutions , one with @xmath93 and two more with @xmath92 . which of the solutions represent the true minimum",
    "can only be determined by examining the value of the effective potential .",
    "this is a typical situation where a first - order phase transition occurs .    a detailed numerical investigation of the effective potential shows that the true phase boundary runs as follows . starting from right",
    ", the true phase boundary coincides with the parity phase boundary , and hence being of second order , from the point a to the point d where the envelope of lines of constant @xmath62 starts out . beyond this point ,",
    "the phase transition becomes of first order , and runs along the dashed curve from the point d to the point f which is located on the parity phase boundary curve below the crossing point b. at the point f , the phase transition returns to second order , and runs along the boundary curve from the point f through the crossing point b toward the point c. altogether the parity - broken phase occupies the region above the line adfbc .    below this line",
    "the ground state of the model can be examined by the effective potential with @xmath93 .",
    "the potential no longer depends on @xmath78 , and as a function of @xmath61 has a double well structure .",
    "as one varies @xmath79 below the point f from right to left , the true minimum switches from a positive to a negative value of @xmath61 discontinuously .",
    "this leads to a first - order phase transition along the line fh reaching down to @xmath101 .",
    "we shall call this line as the _ @xmath14 phase boundary_. qualitatively , one may describe the behavior of the system near and below the point f as `` almost '' exhibiting spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry .",
    "we emphasize that the intricate structure involving first - order transitions described above originates from the @xmath121 term of the effective potential @xmath122 ( _ i.e. , _ @xmath63 in physical units ) which contains terms cubic in @xmath61 .",
    "this contrasts with the leading @xmath60 terms in ( [ 60 ] ) which gives rise to only simple second - order transitions on the @xmath123 plane . indeed , including the @xmath121 contributions given by @xmath124 \\sigma _",

    "[ fig : mu0phasedet ] .",
    "the phase structure on the @xmath99 plane we have discussed for @xmath126 remains the same toward @xmath106 except that the structure as a whole moves down toward @xmath101 and becomes narrower horizontally . in the weak - coupling limit @xmath108",
    ", the boundary line degenerates to @xmath127 which does not have a self - crossing .",
    "the first - order line df disappears , and the entire phase boundary becomes of second order .",
    "we thus find the phase structure in the three - dimensional parameter space @xmath88 as schematically drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] .",
    "let us now discuss the continuum limit , in particular , how the phase structure relates with the tuning of parameters specified by ( [ 110]-[91 ] ) .",
    "the tuned point @xmath115 without @xmath63 terms ( cross in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu0phasedet ] ) is located slightly to the left and below the point b in the parity - symmetric phase .",
    "when one takes the coupling @xmath37 to zero , the relative location of the tuned point and the @xmath14 phase boundary remains the same . therefore taking the continuum limit",
    "exactly along the tuned point @xmath115 leads to a negative value of @xmath14 .",
    "this , however , does not mean that a continuum limit with a positive value of @xmath14 is not possible .    as we have already pointed out , the structure around the point f stems from the @xmath121 terms of the effective potential , and hence its size shrinks as a power of @xmath34 .",
    "one can estimate the effect of adding ( [ eq : dv3rd ] ) to ( [ 60 ] ) by an order counting . since @xmath79 is the coefficient of the linear term @xmath61 in ( [ 60 ] ) , the @xmath121 correction ( [ eq : dv3rd ] ) causes a shift of form @xmath128 hence the structure has a size of @xmath60 in @xmath79 . by a similar argument for @xmath78 , we conclude a size of @xmath63 for @xmath78 .",
    "the point of tuning , on the other hand , has a degree of freedom of @xmath60 for @xmath79 and @xmath63 for @xmath78 .",

    "however , as @xmath37 is lowered below the threshold value , the parity - breaking phase boundary moves up toward larger @xmath78 , and the @xmath14 phase boundary disappears .",
    "once the line enters into this region , the value of @xmath61 becomes small .",
    "in other words , for each fixed temporal size , the threshold value of @xmath37 marks the region of finite - temperature transition .",

    "we observe that the curves for finite @xmath148 smoothly approaches the continuum result drawn by a thick line as @xmath148 increases toward @xmath158 .",
    "several remarks are in order with this figure : ( i ) the negative sign of @xmath14 is due to the fact , already remarked in sec .",
    "[ sec : three ] , that the continuum limit is taken on the left side of the @xmath14 phase boundary .",
    "( ii ) in the region close to the continuum critical point @xmath159 , @xmath160 has a small discontinuity , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : sgnt1loop ] , which reduce with increasing @xmath148 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the tuned point @xmath115 goes through the vertical @xmath14 phase boundary as @xmath37 is decreased just before the threshold value is reached ( see the relative location of the boundary of @xmath151 and @xmath115 in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasent ] ) .",
    "( iii ) the value of @xmath161 after the discontinuity is very small but non - zero for a finite @xmath148 .",
    "it exactly vanishes for @xmath162 only in the limit of @xmath154 .",
    "another possible choice for the continuum limit is to run along the bottom of the valley of the parity - breaking phase boundary for each value of @xmath148 ( line ejb in fig .",
    "[ fig : f6 ] ) .",
    "the limiting point b of the line at @xmath163 has a non - zero value of @xmath78 .",
    "this point , however , reaches the correct continuum limit @xmath157 as @xmath154 . above the threshold value of @xmath37 ( point j )",
    "where the @xmath14 phase boundary exist , @xmath160 has two solutions of opposite sign(@xmath164 ) . at the bottom of the valley , these two solution are the balancing minima of the effective potential , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath165 at the threshold value of @xmath37 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 merge through a second - order singularity corresponding to the second - order phase transition ( line ji ) marking the end of the first - order @xmath14 phase boundary .    with this choice of the continuum limit",
    ", we obtain the behavior of @xmath168 and @xmath169 shown by dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : sgntbp ] and fig .",

    "a notable property is that the system exhibits a second - order phase transition already for finite values of @xmath148 as the line passes through the point j in fig .",
    "[ fig : f6 ] . also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sgntbp ] by dotted lines is the difference of the two solutions divided by 2 , @xmath170 , which shows a faster convergence to the continuum result .",
    "we now consider the phase diagram for non - zero chemical potential , starting with the case of zero temperature ( @xmath150 ) . in this case , from ( [ 170]-[230 ] ) , the effective potential is given by @xmath172 \\label{250}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as one expects from this expression , as long as @xmath173 is small , the phase boundary on the @xmath99 plane does not move from that with @xmath149 .",
    "however , as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : muntinf ] for @xmath126 , when @xmath173 exceeds a threshold value ( @xmath174 for fig .",
    "[ fig : muntinf ] ) , the vertical @xmath14 phase boundary splits into two vertical first - order boundaries such that @xmath61 between the two boundaries is near zero .",
    "the end points of the two boundaries slide upwards in the opposite directions along the parity phase boundary for @xmath150 , and the phase boundary connecting the two end points , which is of first - order , is convex and moves upward toward larger @xmath78 .",
    "this behavior reflects the fact that the effective potential , which has a double well structure at @xmath175 develops an additional minimum close to @xmath119 as @xmath173 increases beyond the threshold value .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : f10 ] . which of the three minima represents the true minimum depends on the value of @xmath79 , which leads to the double first - order boundaries seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : muntinf ] .    an important point with",
    "the behavior described above is that the two vertical first - order boundaries move away from the edge point f of the parity phase boundary at @xmath149 .",
    "since the point ( [ 110]-[91 ] ) for taking the continuum limit is located near the point f , this means that the system , initially in one of the phases with a non - zero value of @xmath61 at @xmath149 undergoes a first - order phase transition when the boundary moves over the point as @xmath173 increases .",
    "after this takes place , the system is in the middle phase with @xmath176 , which qualitatively means that chiral symmetry becomes restored .",
    "this , then , is the mechanism by which the lattice model yields the first - order finite density phase transition at zero temperature .",
    "these points are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : muntinfb ] for @xmath116 . for the tuned point @xmath115 , for example ,",
    "the left vertical phase boundary moves over the point between @xmath177 and 0.13 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : f8 ] we translate the behavior into a schematic three - dimensional phase diagram for @xmath150 and a fixed value of @xmath173 .",
    "finally we consider the finite - density transition at finite temperature .",
    "we examine this case by decreasing the temporal lattice size from @xmath150 .",
    "the phase structure for @xmath150 found in sec .",
    "[ subsec : fivea ] implies that the mechanism of generation of a first - order transition through a splitting of the @xmath14 phase boundary as @xmath173 increases will remain operative for large temporal size @xmath148 .",
    "we found this to be the case as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ntmuphase1st ] for @xmath179 at @xmath180 .",
    "on the other hand , for small temporal sizes , we expect the behavior to become similar to the finite - temperature and zero chemical potential case examined in sec .",
    "[ sec : three ] .",
    "we plot an example of this case in fig .",
    "[ fig : ntmuphase2nd ] for which @xmath148 is decreased to 28 : the parity - broken phase shrinks , and the first - order segment of the phase boundary and the @xmath14 phase boundary disappear as one increases @xmath173 . in this case the phase transition is of second order in the continuum limit .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : sgntmu1st1loop ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : sgntmu2nd1loop ] curves of @xmath181 calculated as a function of @xmath182 for a fixed value of @xmath156 along the tuned point @xmath115 . a clear discontinuity observed in fig .  [ fig : sgntmu1st1loop ] for @xmath183 contrasts sharply with the convergence to second - order behavior seen for @xmath184 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sgntmu2nd1loop ] .",
    "this difference reflects the change of order of finite - density transition for large and small temporal lattice sizes discussed above . in the continuum limit",
    "we thus find a line of phase transition on the @xmath185 plane which switches from being of first - order to second order as the critical temperature increases .",

    "in this article we have investigated the phase structure and the continuum extrapolation of the two - dimensional lattice gross - neveu model at finite temperature and chemical potential .",
    "the choice of the wilson action for fermions leads to the existence of a parity - broken phase separated from the parity - symmetric phase by a two - dimensional boundary surface in the three - dimensional space of the couplings @xmath88 that specifies the model .",
    "the phase transition across the surface is generally of second order .",
    "however , in the region relevant for the continuum limit , @xmath63 effects of the wilson term gives rise to a complicated structure , rendering the transition to be of first order in a region whose size vanishes in the continuum limit . the parity - symmetric phase is also divided into subregions by a first - order phase boundary corresponding to different minima of the effective potential .",
    "we found that these detailed structures intertwine to lead to the continuum phase diagram reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an interesting issue is how much of the detailed structure we found for the gross - neveu model has relevance for qcd in four dimensions .",
    "of particular interest is the question that a part of the parity - flavor breaking phase boundary may be of first order .",
    "while the necessity of two independent couplings @xmath37 and @xmath78 appears to be a specific feature of the gross - neveu model , arising from the presence of four - fermion couplings in the model , a distortion of the effective potential for effective meson fields in the @xmath14 direction by terms odd in @xmath14 would be present also for qcd , possibly triggering a first - order phase transition .",
    "the relevance of the structure we found for finite chemical potential is more likely ; the emergence of three regions corresponding to three different values of @xmath14 for large @xmath2 is a physical effect , not specifically tied with the use of the wilson actions for fermions .",
    "the crossover from a first - order to second - order transition depending on the critical temperature means , however , that the order of the finite density transition may depend sensitively on the parameters of the model , perhaps the space - time dimension playing an important role@xcite .",
