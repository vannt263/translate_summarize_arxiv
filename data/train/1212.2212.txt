    "the concept and definition of strangeness emerged over a roughly twenty - year period , following discovery of the ( neutral ) kaon @xcite . like the charged pions , all kaons are stable against strong and electromagnetic decays .",
    "hence , to the first observers they appeared to survive a strangely long time . as a strong interaction bound state ,",
    "whose decay is mediated only by the weak interaction ( thus , the relatively long lifetime ) , kaons have been instrumental in establishing the foundation and properties of the standard model ; most notably , perhaps , the notions of cp violation and weak - interaction mixing between quark flavours .",
    "simple phenomena involving kaons continue to provide a valuable means by which to make precision tests of the standard model @xcite .",
    "the association of strangeness with a distinct quark flavour was complete with the advent of the constituent quark model @xcite .",
    "as a scheme for systematically classifying hadrons according to their quark content , the quark model is adequate for pions and kaons . however , it early became clear @xcite that quantum mechanical models can not veraciously describe the masses and interactions of pions and kaons because they are ( pseudo- ) goldstone bosons associated with dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) .",
    "owing to the existence of nonzero current - quark masses @xcite , pions and kaons are not consummate goldstone modes .",
    "comparison between their properties can expose the differences in magnitudes between both the current- and constituent - like masses of @xmath6-quarks and the @xmath7-quark ; and the wider impact of these differences .",
    "this window on @xmath8-flavour symmetry breaking therefore provides direct access to both explicit and dynamical effects in a wide variety of domains .",
    "for example : the mass formulae for pseudo - goldstone bosons involve both current - quark masses and order parameters for dcsb @xcite ; and the ratio of kaon and pion valence-@xmath3-quark distribution functions provides access to a renormalisation scale invariant ratio of dcsb order parameters @xcite .",
    "herein we analyse kaon and pion elastic and semileptonic transition form factors with the framework of qcd s dyson - schwinger equations @xcite .",
    "this study is an integral part of a larger programme , aimed at charting the interaction between light - quarks by explicating the impact of differing assumptions about the behaviour of the bethe - salpeter kernel upon the spectrum of hadrons , and also upon their elastic and transition form factors on a large domain of momentum transfer .",
    "material progress has been made in connection with @xmath6-quark systems @xcite ; and a spectrum of mesons and baryons with one or more @xmath7-quarks was recently computed @xcite . in order to extend the latter to predictions for elastic and transition form factors of baryons containing @xmath7-quarks , it is necessary to compute such form factors for mesons containing @xmath7-quarks .",
    "this need is readily explained @xcite .",
    "many properties of baryons are successfully described via a poincar covariant faddeev equation that expresses the presence of nonpointlike diquark correlations @xcite , evidence for the existence of which is accumulating @xcite .",
    "there is a fundamental mathematical similarity between diquark correlations and uniquely identified meson analogues @xcite .",
    "hence , computing the properties of these analogues is principally equivalent to producing results for the diquark correlations @xcite ; and form factors for diquark correlations are a necessary piece in the computation of baryon form factors @xcite .",
    "in addition , as indicated above , these meson form factors are interesting in their own right .",
    "the pion elastic form factor is much studied theoretically and , on a modest domain , constrained well experimentally @xcite . however , there are fewer single - framework analyses of the pion transition and kaon form factors in which quark - gluon dynamics is discernible ( e.g. , refs . ) , and the data is typically old and imprecise @xcite .",
    "we thus focus primarily on the kaon elastic and transition ( @xmath9 ) form factors , and the pion transition ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "( n.b . except in connection with the pion transition form factor",
    ", we assume isospin symmetry . )    as a poincar - covariant framework , capable of simultaneously implementing light - quark confinement and expressing dcsb , and admitting a symmetry - preserving truncation scheme , the dses are an excellent tool for analysis of these form factors involving the pion and kaon pseudo - goldstone bosons .",
    "our study will exploit a symmetry - preserving treatment of a vector@xmath11vector contact interaction . in contrasting the behaviour produced by such an interaction with",
    "that obtained using a momentum - dependent interaction , which preserves the one - loop renormalisation group behaviour of qcd , we will achieve comparisons that expose those observables which are most sensitive to the infrared evolution of the strong interaction s running coupling and masses or might become so in future with additional experimental effort .",
    "moreover , from careful interpretation of the contact - interaction results , one can draw additional valuable insights . to express this differently",
    ", we take a global perspective centred on the strong interaction and make no effort to fine tune interaction parameters . plainly , then",
    ", we do not intend that this study should make a material contribution to precision tests of the standard model .",
    "rather , we seek to identify those aspects of kaon and pion physics that can serve to discriminate between conjectures about strong interaction dynamics .    in sec.[sec : background ]",
    "we introduce the matrix elements that must be computed , present the associated kinematics , provide some background material on the nature of @xmath8-flavour symmetry breaking , and present the formulae we use to calculate the matrix elements .",
    "we also detail the impact of symmetries and dynamics on the vector part of the dressed - quark@xmath12-boson vertex : an informed understanding of this vertex is crucial in any analysis of hadron form factors . this section is complemented by three appendices .",
    "they detail our symmetry - preserving treatment of the vector@xmath11vector contact interaction , including some information about the gap and bethe - salpeter equations and current conservation ; and list a formula for the kaon elastic form factor , which is readily mapped into an expression for the analogous pion form factor . in secs.[sec : resultselastic ] and [ sec : resultstransition ] we present our results along with a detailed comparative analysis in the context of experiment and kindred theoretical studies .",

    "first , as also observed elsewhere @xcite , in connection with observables determined by probes with @xmath0 , results obtained using a symmetry - preserving regularisation of the contact - interaction are not realistically distinguishable from those produced by the most sophisticated qcd renormalisation - group - improved kernels currently available .",
    "in addition , available data on the charged - kaon form factor do not extend into the domain whereupon one could distinguish between contact - interaction results and those obtained with qcd - like kernels .    as the lower panel in fig.[fig :",
    "fksmall ] shows , the picture changes completely if one includes the domain @xmath2 .",
    "it was demonstrated in ref.@xcite that pseudoscalar meson bethe - salpeter amplitudes necessarily possess components that may be described as pseudovector in character .",
    "these components impact materially on a vast array of quantities involving pseudoscalar mesons and , of particular relevance herein , the large-@xmath151 behaviour of their form factors @xcite .",

    "we compared our form factors with those obtained using the same truncation but an interaction that preserves the one - loop renormalisation group behaviour of qcd .",
    "the comparison showed that in connection with experimental observables revealed by probes with @xmath0 , where @xmath1gev is an infrared value of the dressed - quark mass , results obtained using a symmetry - preserving regularisation of the contact - interaction are not realistically distinguishable from those produced by more sophisticated kernels .",
    "it is notable , too , that available data on the kaon form factors do not extend into the domain whereupon one could distinguish between contact - interaction results and those obtained with qcd - like kernels .",
    "these remarks may be quantified by the following observation : considering a collection of eleven @xmath0 quantities , the contact interaction produces a rms - error relative to experiment of 25% , whereas this error is @xmath263% for the more sophisticated interaction .",

    "the picture is different if one includes the domain @xmath2 , whereupon a consistent treatment of the contact interaction yields harder form factors than those obtained with one - loop qcd renormalisation - group - improved kernels .",
    "this owes to the necessary presence in pseudoscalar meson bethe - salpeter amplitudes of terms that may be described as pseudovector in character . in this context ,",
    "an inconsistent treatment of the contact interaction is possible ; namely , through deliberate omission of the pseudoscalar mesons pseudovector components .",
    "results obtained thereby are just as soft as those produced by a fully - consistent treatment of a momentum - dependent kernel that behaves as @xmath266 in the ultraviolet .    in the past , this omission was mere negligence ; and results obtained were often misinterpreted as questioning the need for qcd . from a modern perspective , however , the omission might be used judiciously in order to build efficacious models for hadron physics phenomena that can not readily be studied using more elaborate means , so long as neither agreement nor disagreement with experiment is interpreted as a challenge to qcd . for the phenomena studied herein ,",
    "such an artifice is quite fruitful ; e.g. , it produces a rms - error of @xmath267% ( or mmre@xmath268% ) over the basket of eleven @xmath0 quantities mentioned above and a @xmath151-dependence of form factors that is typically almost indistinguishable from that obtained with the fully - consistent treatment of a sophisticated interaction .",
    "in addition , it enables one to develop a perspective on the point at which perturbative - qcd behaviour might become apparent in meson form factors .    in stepping toward these conclusions , we were able to make a number of other observations .",
    "for example , it was necessary to detail the properties of the inhomogeneous vector and scalar vertices , a process which led us to a novel ward identity for the scalar vertex .",
    "in addition , we found that the charge distribution of a dressed-@xmath3-quark in the @xmath4 is very similar to that of the dressed-@xmath3-quark in the @xmath5 , whereas the charge distribution of the dressed-@xmath7-quark in the @xmath4 is noticeably harder than that of its @xmath3-quark partner .",

    "it also emphasises that studies employing a symmetry - preserving regularisation of the contact interaction can usefully serve as a surrogate , enabling the exploration of domains which analyses using interactions that more closely follow the pointwise behaviour anticipated of qcd are not yet able to enter . at present , prudent studies of this type are critical in attempts to use experimental data as a tool for charting the nature of the quark - quark interaction at long - range ; i.e. , for identifying distinct signals of the running of couplings and masses in qcd .",

    "<S> elastic and semileptonic transition form factors for the kaon and pion are calculated using the leading - order in a global - symmetry - preserving truncation of the dyson - schwinger equations and a momentum - independent form for the associated kernels in the gap and bethe - salpeter equations . </S>",
    "<S> the computed form factors are compared both with those obtained using the same truncation but an interaction that preserves the one - loop renormalisation - group behaviour of qcd and with data . </S>",
    "<S> the comparisons show that : in connection with observables revealed by probes with @xmath0 , where @xmath1gev is an infrared value of the dressed - quark mass , results obtained using a symmetry - preserving regularisation of the contact - interaction are not realistically distinguishable from those produced by more sophisticated kernels ; and available data on kaon form factors do not extend into the domain whereupon one could distinguish between the interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is different if one includes the domain @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> thereupon , a fully consistent treatment of the contact interaction produces form factors that are typically harder than those obtained with qcd renormalisation - group - improved kernels . amongst other things also described are a ward identity for the inhomogeneous scalar vertex , similarity between the charge distribution of a dressed-@xmath3-quark in the @xmath4 and that of the dressed-@xmath3-quark in the @xmath5 , and reflections upon the point whereat one might begin to see perturbative behaviour in the pion form factor . </S>",
    "<S> interpolations of the form factors are provided , which should assist in working to chart the interaction between light - quarks by explicating the impact on hadron properties of differing assumptions about the behaviour of the bethe - salpeter kernel . </S>"
