    "in this paper we consider ising spin glass models , in particular the infinite - range sherrington - kirkpatrick  ( sk ) model  @xcite and the nearest neighbor edwards - anderson ( ea ) model  @xcite on @xmath0 .",
    "the sk hamiltonian ( for @xmath1 spins ) is @xmath2 where the couplings @xmath3 are independent , identically distributed random variables chosen , e.g. , from a gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance one .    in a series of papers , parisi and collaborators",
    "@xcite proposed , and worked out the consequences of , an extraordinary _ ansatz _ for the nature of this phase . following the mathematical procedures underlying the solution",
    ", it came to be known as _ replica symmetry breaking _ ( rsb ) .",
    "the starting point of the parisi solution was that the low - temperature spin glass phase comprised not just a single spin - reversed pair of states , but rather `` infinitely many pure thermodynamic states ''  @xcite , not related by any simple symmetry transformations .",
    "what is primarily of interest is the _ distribution _ of the overlaps between two sk ` pure states '  @xcite @xmath4 and @xmath5 , defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a thermal average in pure state @xmath4 , and dependence on the coupling realization @xmath8 and temperature @xmath9 has been suppressed .",
    "the overlap distribution is constructed by choosing , at fixed @xmath1 and @xmath9 , two of the pure states @xmath4 and @xmath5 present with probabilites @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the gibbs state .",
    "the probability that their overlap lies between @xmath12 and @xmath13 is then given by the quantity @xmath14 , where @xmath15 as before , we suppress the dependence on @xmath9 and @xmath1 for ease of notation .",
    "the average @xmath16 of @xmath17 over the disorder distribution is commonly referred to as the _ parisi overlap distribution _ , and serves as an order parameter for the sk model .",
    "the ea hamiltonian in zero external field is given by @xmath18 where the nearest - neighbor couplings @xmath19 are defined in exactly the same way as the @xmath3 in the sk  hamiltonian  ( [ eq : sk ] ) .",
    "in this model , and unlike in the sk model , thermodynamic pure , mixed , and ground states are standard , well - defined ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) objects , constructed according to well - established prescriptions of statistical mechanics  @xcite .    now suppose  as has often been conjectured for finite - range spin glasses  @xcite  that there are many pure states not simply related to each other by symmetry transformations .",
    "if this is the case , it was shown in  @xcite that local variables , such as correlations , will vary chaotically and unpredictably as volume size changes ( with , say , periodic boundary conditions on each volume ) . is it then even possible to describe the nature of large finite volume systems via a single infinite volume object , and if so , how ?",
    "it turns out that an object , called the _ metastate _  @xcite by the authors , can be constructed to capture the nature of the behavior inside finite systems as volume increases .",
    "the metastate is a useful tool that describes the empirical distribution of local variables as volume increases without bound , and is described in more detail in the companion paper  @xcite and in  @xcite .",
    "the seemingly chaotic behavior with increasing volume is modelled by random sampling from the metastate , regarded as a probability measure on the space of gibbs states . using the metastate approach",
    ", we now examine more closely the nature of the low - temperature spin glass phase .",
    "there are three scenarios that have received the major share of attention in the current literature . here",
    "we refer only to those dealing with the _ pure state _",
    "structure of the low - temperature spin glass phase .",
    "other pictures have also received a great deal of attention , particularly the excited state scenario of krzakala - martin  @xcite and palassini - young  @xcite .",
    "proving or disproving these or related pictures is important for achieving a thorough understanding of the low - temperature physics of spin glasses .",
    "however , because it can be shown  @xcite that these pictures describe excitations that do _ not _ alter pure state structure , their presence or absence can be logically incorporated into any of the three pictures that we are about to describe ( although on heuristic grounds they appear incompatible with the rsb picture ) .",
    "low - temperature pictures of spin glass long - range order and broken symmetry start with an assumption about the number of pure states @xmath20 ( which is the same for almost every coupling realization  @xmath8  see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "they assume also a putative critical ( inverse ) temperature @xmath21 separating a paramagnetic phase for @xmath22 from a spin glass phase for @xmath23 .",
    "although there is good numerical  @xcite and some analytical  @xcite evidence that above some lower critical dimension @xmath24 there does exist such a finite @xmath25 , there is as yet no proof or even a strong physical argument supporting such a conjecture .",
    "moreover , there is no logical reason why there can not be _ two _ or more phase transitions in some dimensions .",
    "however , we will not attempt to enumerate all possibilities here ; we will confine ourselves to the most likely scenarios .",
    "we defer to sec .",
    "[ sec : wild ] a consideration ( mostly for the fun of it ) of some of the more outlandish sounding possibilities .",
    "the actual value of @xmath26 is not rigorously known at large @xmath5 for any @xmath27 .",
    "there does exist a rigorous argument  @xcite supporting  but not completely proving  the conjecture that @xmath28 , and a heuristic argument  @xcite supporting the conjecture that @xmath29 .",
    "it is generally assumed ( but also not proved ) that spin - flip symmetry is broken for @xmath30 , so that pure states come in global spin - flip reversed pairs .    given all these assumptions , pure state scenarios generally assume either a single pair of pure states or infinitely many .",
    "again , there is at this time no argument proving that one can not have , say , @xmath31 ; it s just difficult to imagine why such a scenario should occur .",
    "there is , however , a reasonably strong heuristic argument  @xcite indicating that if @xmath32 , it must be an _",
    "uncountable _ infinity ( we will prove this in sec .  [",
    "sec : rsbforsrms ] for the rsb picture ) .    while an assumption about @xmath26 is the _ starting point _ for each of the three pictures we now describe , they are each much more than a simple assertion about the number of pure states . in particular , there are potentially many 2-state or many - state pictures that correspond to _ none _ of these three scenarios . here",
    "the only aspect of the three on which we will focus is the relationship among the pure states .",
    "the scenarios are , in order of increasing complexity , the scaling / droplet ( sd ) picture  @xcite , the chaotic pairs ( cp ) picture  @xcite , and the rsb picture  @xcite .",
    "the first is a 2-state scenario , while the second and third are many - state scenarios . the pure state structure in these pictures is normally described through the parisi overlap function  @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "this function needs to be used with great care in describing pure state structure in short - range models ; see  @xcite for a discussion of some of the pitfalls and problems that can occur in its applications .    in the next subsection we provide precise definitions of the pure state structure of these pictures",
    "; we limit ourselves here to brief heuristic descriptions . as already noted , scaling /",
    "droplet is a two - state picture .",
    "the overlap distribution is therefore simply a pair of @xmath33-functions at @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the edwards - anderson order parameter  @xcite , regardless of whether replicas and overlaps are taken before or after the thermodynamic limit is taken , as shown in fig .  1  ( see below and especially  @xcite for a more detailed discussion of the difference between the two procedures ) .",
    "the cp picture considers the possibility of an infinite number of pure state pairs , but with a trivial overlap structure : all large , finite volumes would display an overlap structure equivalent to the sd picture because only a single pair of pure states appears in each of these volumes . the actual pure state pair , however , varies chaotically as volume changes because different volumes select different members from the infinite ensemble of such pairs .",
    "the overlap distribution for the infinite volume in the cp picture , constructed by choosing replicas and taking their overlaps _",
    "after _ going to the thermodynamic limit , would then presumably be a simple @xmath33-function at zero overlap ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 ) .",
    "[ fig : sdcp ]    there are actually two rsb pictures , which we have called ` standard ' and ` nonstandard ' sk  @xcite .",
    "the first chooses replicas _ after _ taking the thermodynamic limit , and the second before .",
    "both have nontrivial overlap structures , which will be described in the next subsection .    before turning to that ,",
    "we need to say a few words about the dimension dependence of the three pictures .",
    "the only one of these with specific predictions is the sd picture , which asserts that in _ every _ finite dimension where spin - flip symmetry is broken , there is only a single pure state pair .",
    "the cp picture does not make any corresponding claim ; it merely asserts that _ if _ @xmath32 at some @xmath36 , _ then _ the overlap structure must be trivial in the manner specified above .",
    "if the rsb picture correctly describes the ea model at @xmath37 , then both the sd and cp models agree that the upper critical dimension @xmath38 for the ea model .",
    "the rsb picture is slightly less vague about its dimension - dependence ; it does apparently assume that there exists a strictly finite @xmath39 for the ea model , and that replica symmetry is broken in the nontrivial manner it specifies for all @xmath40 .",
    "the precise value of @xmath39 within this picture remains uncertain , but it seems to be higher than two and less than or equal to three  @xcite .",
    "we now turn to a precise description of the three competing pictures , which is greatly facilitated by using the metastate .    in sd",
    ", there is only a single pair of pure states , and these are the same in every large volume ; the overlap distribution function @xmath41 in a volume @xmath42 therefore simply approximates a sum of two @xmath33-functions at @xmath43 , as shown in  fig .",
    "1(a ) . in the cp picture",
    ", each finite - volume gibbs state @xmath44 will still be approximately a mixture of a _ single _ pair of spin - flip - related pure states , _ but now the pure state pair will vary chaotically with @xmath45 . _",
    "then for each @xmath42 , @xmath41 will again approximate a sum of two @xmath33-functions at @xmath43 .",
    "so chaotic pairs resembles the scaling / droplet picture in finite volumes , but has a very different thermodynamic structure .",
    "it is a many - state picture , but differs from the rsb picture ( see below ) in that only a _",
    "single _ pair of spin - reversed pure states @xmath46 , @xmath47 , appears in a large volume @xmath42 with symmetric boundary conditions , such as periodic . in other words , for large @xmath45 , one finds that @xmath48 and the pure state pair ( of the infinitely many present ) appearing in a particular finite volume @xmath42 depends chaotically on @xmath45 .",
    "that is , the periodic b.c .",
    "metastate is dispersed over many @xmath49 s ( in fact , an uncountable infinity , as we shall see below ; this also occurs in the rsb picture ) , but ( unlike in rsb ) each @xmath49 is a _",
    "trivial _ mixture of the form @xmath50 .",
    "the overlap distribution for each @xmath49 is the same : @xmath51 .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is a spin glass model ( the ` highly disordered model '  @xcite ) that appears to display just this behavior in its ground state structure above eight dimensions .",
    "we now turn to the standard and nonstandard mean - field - like scenarios .",
    "the standard sk picture is perhaps most concisely described in the introduction of  @xcite .",
    "it requires a gibbs equilibrium measure @xmath52 which is decomposable into many pure states",
    "@xmath53 : @xmath54    in this picture replicas are taken _",
    "after _ going to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "that is , one chooses @xmath55 and @xmath56 from the product distribution @xmath57 , and then the overlap can be defined as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the volume of the cube @xmath42 .",
    "suppose that @xmath55 is drawn from pure state @xmath60 and @xmath56 from @xmath61 .",
    "then  ( [ eq : overlap ] ) equals its thermal mean  @xcite @xmath62 and so the overlap distribution @xmath17 is given by @xmath63    according to this picture , the @xmath64 s and @xmath65 s are non - self - averaging quantities , except when @xmath66 or its global flip , where @xmath67 .",
    "the average @xmath16 of @xmath17 over the disorder distribution @xmath68 of the couplings is then a mixture of two delta - function components at @xmath43 and a continuous part between them .",
    "there is a technical problem ( caused by chaotic size dependence  @xcite ) in the construction of @xmath69 that can be overcome by using the periodic b.c .",
    "metastate @xmath70 ( in fact , any coupling - independent metastate would do )",
    ". one can construct  @xcite a state @xmath69 which is the _ average _ over the metastate : @xmath71 one can also think of this @xmath72 as the average thermodynamic state , @xmath73 , in the limit @xmath74 .",
    "it can be proved @xcite that @xmath69 is a gibbs state .",
    "numerically one constructs overlaps without constructing gibbs states at all .",
    "such a construction ( similar to that above ) is described in @xcite , and leads ultimately to the same conclusion .    but this picture can be rigorously ruled out for the ea model  @xcite , as will be shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : rsbforsrms ] .",
    "so the most natural ( and usual ) interpretation of a mean - field - like picture can not be applied to short - range spin glasses .",
    "the question then becomes : are there alternative , less straightforward interpretations ? to address this question , we constructed in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) an alternative mean - field - like picture , the ` nonstandard sk model ' , which we hereafter refer to simply as the rsb picture .",
    "this picture clarifies as well how broken replica symmetry should be interpreted for the sk model .",
    "consider again the pbc metastate , although , as always , almost any other coupling - independent metastate will suffice .",
    "the rsb picture assumes that in each volume @xmath75 , the finite - volume gibbs state @xmath76 is well approximated deep in the interior by a mixed thermodynamic state @xmath77 , decomposable into many pure states @xmath78 : @xmath79 where explicit dependence on @xmath8 is suppressed .    as in the chaotic pairs picture ,",
    "the mixed states @xmath77 change in some `` chaotic '' fashion with @xmath80 .",
    "furthermore , each mixed state @xmath81 is presumed to have a nontrivial overlap distribution @xmath82 of the form shown in fig .  2 .",
    "moreover , the distances among any three pure states _ within a particular _ @xmath49 are assumed to be ultrametric  @xcite .    [",
    "fig : nonstandard ]    we conclude with a brief note about zero temperature . in each @xmath42",
    "( with periodic b.c.s ) there can only be a single ground state pair at @xmath83 ( because we are considering gaussian couplings rather than a @xmath84 model ) .",
    "if scaling / droplet holds , then this pair is the same for all large @xmath45 ; if infinitely many ground state pairs exist , then the pair changes chaotically with @xmath45 . in this respect",
    "the behavior of cp is the same at both zero and nonzero temperatures ( below @xmath85 ) , and the same can be said for sd .",
    "so the overlap functions of cp and rsb differ only at positive temperature : the mean - field rsb picture at @xmath86 has the @xmath87 in each volume exhibiting a nontrivial mixture of pure state pairs as in  ( [ eq : gamma ] ) , while in chaotic pairs the @xmath87 appearing in any @xmath42 consists of a single pure state pair , as in  ( [ eq : possfive ] ) .",
    "there remains , however , an important difference between the cp and rsb pictures at zero temperature , in that the space - filling interfaces between ground states should have energies that scale differently ; see  @xcite and the companion paper in this volume  @xcite for a more detailed discussion .",
    "we begin by eliminating the standard sk picture from further consideration ; the detailed rigorous proof appears in  @xcite . using the torus - translation symmetry of the periodic b.c.s",
    ", one can show that the gibbs state @xmath69 is translation-_covariant _ ; that is , @xmath88 , or in terms of correlations , @xmath89 , and similarly for @xmath90-point correlations .",
    "translation covariance of @xmath72 immediately implies , via eqs .",
    "( [ eq : overlap])([eq : pj(q ) ] ) , translation invariance of @xmath91 .",
    "but , given the translation - ergodicity of the underlying disorder distribution @xmath68 , _ it immediately follows that _ @xmath17 _ is self - averaging , and equals its distribution average @xmath16 for a.e .  _",
    "the impossibility of a non - self - averaging @xmath17 can also be shown for other coupling - independent b.c.s , where torus - translation symmetry is absent , using methods described in @xcite .",
    "this leaves nonstandard sk as a maximally allowed mean - field - type picture . before discussing its viability ,",
    "we explain why neither cp nor nonstandard sk remains viable if modified to have only a _",
    "countable _ infinity of pure states .",
    "we do this first by a heuristic argument valid for both cp and nonstandard sk , and then by a rigorous argument valid only for nonstandard sk .",
    "the conclusion of this exercise is that both alternatives to the sd scenario of a single pure state pair require _",
    "uncountably many _",
    "( i.e. , a continuum of ) pure state pairs for a single fixed @xmath92 .",
    "consider @xmath72 , the average over the periodic  b.c .",
    "metastate @xmath93 .",
    "changing from periodic boundary conditions to antiperiodic , or to any of the many other ` partially antiperiodic ' boundary conditions related to periodic ones by a gauge transformation , leaves @xmath93 and consequently @xmath72 unchanged  @xcite . on heuristic grounds , unless @xmath72 is of the sd form with only a single pair of pure states , then this lack of dependence on boundary conditions should hold only if @xmath72 is a _ uniform _ mixture over infinitely many pure states @xmath60  i.e. , the relative weights of all @xmath60 s in @xmath72 are equal .",
    "but that is clearly impossible if the number of @xmath94 s is countably infinite .    in the case of an sk - type picture , where the @xmath49 s appearing in the metastate @xmath93 involve nontrivial weights @xmath64",
    ", one can go further and _ prove _ that nontrivial @xmath64 s require uncountably many @xmath60 s to appear in @xmath93 .",
    "the argument proceeds as follows .",
    "if there are only countably many @xmath60 s , then the corresponding weights ( say , ordered by magnitude ) in @xmath72 will be measurable and translation - invariant functions of @xmath8 . by translation - ergodicity",
    ", this means that they are in fact _ independent _ of @xmath8 and so remain the same if finitely many couplings @xmath19 change by amounts @xmath95 .",
    "moreover , one can consider the finitely many @xmath4 s corresponding to , say , the largest @xmath96 weights in @xmath72 , and then the _ distribution _ of their weights within the @xmath49 s of the metastate @xmath93 is also independent of @xmath8 .",
    "on the other hand , this leads to a contradiction , because a @xmath49 in the nonstandard sk metastate  ( see  eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) ) is a nontrivial mixture of pure states and their weights . by the aizenman - wehr transformation  @xcite",
    ", a pure state @xmath97 transforms to a pure state @xmath98 under such a finite change @xmath99 , and its weight @xmath10 within @xmath49 correspondingly changes according to @xmath100 where @xmath101    for pure states @xmath4 and @xmath33 that are not identical one can find a choice of @xmath102 , with all @xmath95 small , such that @xmath103 .",
    "then for all @xmath49 s in which @xmath104 and @xmath105 are nonzero , the ratio @xmath106 is changed from @xmath107 by the same factor @xmath108 , that is close to @xmath109 . but",
    "this implies that @xmath110 will change the distribution of the weights within the metastate , leading to a contradiction .",
    "we have thus sketched the proof of :    * theorem 1 .",
    "* the pbc metastate @xmath93 for the ea spin glass can not assign strictly positive probability to @xmath49 s whose pure state decompositions satisfy both :    \\(i ) @xmath111 , with not all @xmath112 , and    \\(ii ) over all these @xmath49 s only countably many",
    "@xmath60 s appear .",
    "an immediate consequence of theorem  1 , when combined with our earlier arguments , is that the only remaining mean - field - like picture is the nonstandard sk model with a ( periodic b.c . )",
    "metastate @xmath93 whose average @xmath72 is supported on an _ uncountable _ infinity of pure states .",
    "we can not at this point rule this scenario out rigorously , but can provide a strong heuristic argument , based on a rigorous result , that makes it very unlikely .",
    "the rigorous result is the already mentioned _ invariance of the metastate _",
    "@xcite : two metastates constructed using gauge - related b.c.s ( e.g. , periodic and antiperiodic , or any two randomly chosen fixed b.c.s ) are _ identical_.",
    "this makes it difficult to see how any many - state picture can have a @xmath72 supported on anything other than a uniform distribution of pure states .",
    "but if this did occur for a particular @xmath8 , an aizenman - wehr transformation suggests that the uniformity would be destroyed for a finitely different @xmath113 .",
    "( for detailed arguments , see  @xcite . )    why does nt this argument also rule out chaotic pairs ?",
    "because in the chaotic pairs picture , as in scaling / droplet , there are in each @xmath87 only two pure states ( although in cp the pair depends on @xmath45 ) , each with weight @xmath114 .",
    "all even correlations are the same in any pair of flip - related pure states , so , by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : walpha ] ) and ( [ eq : ralpha ] ) , any change in couplings leaves the weights unchanged .",
    "we conclude that the only viable many - state scenario for short - range ising spin glasses is the cp picture with an uncountable infinity of pure states .",
    "this picture has trivial replica symmetry breaking ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 ) and consequently a very simple overlap structure .",
    "in sec .  [ sec : trinity ] we presented the most likely scenarios for the pure state structure of the spin glass phase in short - range models .",
    "one of these , the rsb picture , although _ a priori _ plausible , especially given its relevance to the sk model , was rigorously ruled out in two of its possible versions and excluded heuristically in its final remaining version .",
    "however , there are other , more exotic scenarios that might also occur but do not seem to have been considered . here , for the sake of completeness ( and perhaps a little whimsy ) we suggest two . in order to keep the list of possibilities relatively constrained",
    ", we will assume in all that : a ) a thermodynamic phase transition does exist above some lower critical dimension @xmath24 , and b ) in a fixed dimension the low - temperature phase does not alternate among different scenarios , such as sd and cp , as temperature is lowered ( although the third and most exotic scenario may be regarded as a kind of phase of extreme alternation ) .      as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : trinity ] , despite decades of effort and considerable numerical support  @xcite , there remains no proof of a phase transition in ea spin glasses . in this section",
    "we provide a proof that shows that a necessary ( though not sufficient ) condition for broken spin - flip symmetry at @xmath86 is satisfied in lattices with dimension as low as two ( e.g. , a triangular lattice ) .",
    "we also discuss a corresponding sufficient condition .",
    "of course , this ( minimal ) symmetry - breaking is assumed in all scenarios discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : trinity ] ; but here we speculate on the possibility of a phase transition _ without _ the appearance of multiple gibbs states , and discuss why the presence of the necessary condition ( for broken spin - flip symmetry ) at some @xmath36 where the sufficient condition is absent suggests just such a possibility .",
    "although several approaches are possible , we use here the fortuin - kasteleyn random cluster ( rc ) representation  @xcite extended to non - ferromagnetic models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which relates the statistical mechanics of ising ( or potts ) models to a dependent percolation problem .",
    "we let @xmath115 denote the set of bonds @xmath116 in some @xmath117-dimensional lattice @xmath118 , each with corresponding coupling @xmath19 .",

    "it is one of two marginal distributions ( the other being the ordinary gibbs distribution ) of a joint distribution on @xmath124 of the spins and bonds together , and is given ( formally , in the infinite system ) by @xmath125 where @xmath126 is a normalization constant , @xmath127 is the number of clusters determined by the realization @xmath128 , @xmath129 is the bernoulli product measure corresponding to independent occupation variables with @xmath130 , and @xmath131 is the indicator function on the event @xmath132 in @xmath133 that there exists a choice of the spins @xmath134 so that @xmath135 for all @xmath136  @xcite .",
    "@xmath132 is the event that there is no frustration in the occupied bond configuration .",
    "finite - volume versions of the above formulas , with specified boundary conditions , are similarly constructed .",
    "the mapping of this formalism to ferromagnets follows from formulae ( that do not hold for nonferromagnets ) such as  @xcite @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the usual gibbs two - point correlation function and @xmath139 is the rc probability that @xmath140 and @xmath141 are in the same cluster .",
    "similarly , with appropriate rc ( wired ) boundary conditions used for @xmath142 , one has @xmath143 it follows that , for ferromagnets , a phase transition from a unique ( paramagnetic ) phase at low @xmath5 to multiple infinite volume gibbs distributions at large @xmath5 is equivalent to a percolation phase transition for the corresponding rc measure .    for spin glasses ( or other nonferromagnets )",
    "the situation is less straightforward .",
    "now for two sites @xmath140 and @xmath141 , ( [ eq : ferropath ] ) becomes @xmath144 where @xmath145 is any path of occupied bonds from @xmath140 to @xmath141 . by the definition of @xmath132 , any two paths @xmath145 and",
    "@xmath146 in the _ same _ cluster will satisfy @xmath147 .",
    "it is no longer evident that rc percolation is sufficient to prove broken spin - flip symmetry .",

    "for the ferromagnet , by first choosing all @xmath150 and then all @xmath151 , one can change the sign of the spin @xmath152 at the origin even as @xmath153 .",
    "that is , boundary conditions infinitely far away affect @xmath152 , which is a signature of the existence of multiple gibbs distributions .",
    "but for the ea spin glass , it is not clear whether , even in the presence of rc percolation , there exist any two sets of boundary conditions with the same effect .",
    "although the infinite cluster in any one rc realization is unique , different rc realizations can have different paths from @xmath154 , leading to different signs for @xmath152 .",
    "so percolation might still allow for @xmath155 as @xmath153 .    however , it is easy to see that single rc percolation is at least a _ necessary _",
    "condition for multiple ( symmetry - broken ) gibbs phases .",
    "the contribution to the expectation of @xmath152 from any finite rc cluster is zero : if a spin configuration @xmath55 is consistent with a given rc bond realization within such a cluster , @xmath156 is also consistent and equally likely . as a consequence , at a @xmath36 where rc percolation does not hold , @xmath157 in infinite volume .",
    "we note that a slightly stronger version of this argument  @xcite proves that the transition temperature for an ea @xmath84 ( or other ) spin glass , if it exists , is bounded from above by the transition temperature in the corresponding ( disordered ) ferromagnet .",
    "is there a modification of this approach that could lead to a proof of multiple gibbs phases ?",
    "one such possibility is what might be called _",
    "double _ rc percolation .",
    "here one expands the sample space @xmath158 to include two independent copies of the bond occupation variables ( for a given @xmath8 configuration ) , and defines the variable @xmath159 , where @xmath123 and @xmath160 are taken from the two copies .",
    "one then replaces percolation of @xmath128 in the single rc case with percolation of @xmath161 .",
    "it is not hard to see that this would be a sufficient condition for the existence of multiple gibbs phases ( and consequently , for a phase transition ) .",
    "single rc percolation for the ea @xmath84 ising model in @xmath162  @xcite has been proved  @xcite . here",
    "we sketch the outline of a proof ( simpler than the one in  @xcite ) showing that one has single rc percolation _ even in _",
    "@xmath163  e.g. , on the triangular lattice .",
    "this is already interesting for the following reason : because we are not aware of strong numerical evidence of multiple gibbs states for this geometry , this may be considered evidence that single rc percolation can occur in spin glasses without broken spin - flip symmetry .",
    "but there is an even more interesting potential consequence , which we will discuss below .",
    "the proof uses a standard fortuin - kasteleyn - ginibre ( fkg ) argument  @xcite using correlation inequalities .",
    "let @xmath164 be the edge set confined entirely within a volume @xmath42 .",
    "it can be shown that there exist probability measures @xmath165 on @xmath166 such that , if @xmath167 and @xmath168 are nondecreasing real functions ( that is , they do not decrease when any @xmath169 , where every @xmath170 corresponds to @xmath171 , but @xmath172 can correspond to either @xmath173 or 1 ) , then they are positively correlated : @xmath174    one measure satisfying this property is the independent product measure  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the marginal distribution ( i.e. , averaged over the coupling ( signs ) in the @xmath84 model ) of satisfied bonds ( i.e. , using the `` satisfaction '' variables @xmath175 ( or else @xmath176 ) if @xmath177 ) at @xmath178 , satisfies this property .",
    "operationally , one can think of constructing this set by choosing the spins _ first _ through independent flips of a fair coin , and _ then _ choosing the sign of each bond in the same way .",
    "one then has independent , density-1/2 bond occupation , which percolates on the triangular lattice  @xcite .",
    "consider now the satisfaction variables @xmath179 for @xmath180 .",
    "it is not hard to show that , at any such fixed @xmath5 , and for any bond @xmath181 , @xmath182 where @xmath183 is a nonnegative function of @xmath5 .",
    "( [ eq : sat ] ) implies that percolation of satisfied bonds at finite temperature dominates ( in the fkg sense ) percolation at infinite temperature .",
    "since the rc variables @xmath184 are obtained from the satisfaction variables @xmath179 by a slight ( for large @xmath5 ) dilution , it follows that at sufficiently low ( but nonzero ) temperature one has single rc percolation .",
    "it is presumably the case that on the triangular lattice there is no broken spin - flip symmetry , and also only a single gibbs state , at all nonzero temperatures .",
    "but it is worth entertaining the possibility that single , but no double rc percolation , _ does _ imply some sort of phase transition _ but with a single gibbs state at all nonzero temperatures_.    let @xmath185 be the inverse rc percolation transition temperature for the ea model on the triangular lattice . consider again the expectation of the spin at the origin , @xmath186 , in a volume @xmath42 with plus boundary conditions . for @xmath22 , the probability of the site 0 belonging to a cluster reaching the boundary is bounded from above by @xmath187 , where each @xmath188 is a finite constant . therefore @xmath189 .    for @xmath23",
    ", however , the probability that the origin belongs to a cluster reaching the boundary is bounded away from zero as @xmath190 . in order for no phase transition to take place",
    ", there must be at fixed @xmath5 an almost exact cancellation between those rc realizations of ` positive ' ( in the product of the signs of the couplings ) and ` negative ' paths from the origin to the boundary .",
    "it is at least conceivable that , while @xmath191 as @xmath153 , it falls off slower than exponentially  perhaps as a power law in @xmath45 .",
    "this would imply a phase transition from a paramagnetic phase at high temperature to a phase at low temperature with a _",
    "unique _ gibbs state , but one where two - point correlations decay as a power law : @xmath192 as @xmath193 .",
    "this would be analogous to the kosterlitz - thouless phase transition for @xmath194 @xmath195 models  @xcite .",
    "we discussed earlier  @xcite the correspondence between multiple gibbs state _ pairs _ and the appearance of chaotic size dependence of correlations in an infinite sequence of volumes with , say , periodic boundary conditions .",
    "a possibly related phenomenon is the speculated presence in spin glasses ( both infinite- and short - range ) of _ chaotic temperature dependence _ ( ctd ) . roughly speaking",
    ", this refers to an erratic behavior of correlations , upon changing temperature , on lengthscales that diverge as the temperature increment goes to zero .",
    "ctd was predicted  @xcite for the ea spin glass within the sd context ; it also seems to be implied by the rsb theory  @xcite .",
    "more recent numerical and analytical work ( see  @xcite and references therein ) have led to claims that ctd is not present in either the sk or the ea model ( see also  @xcite ) , although  @xcite allows for the possibility of a weak effect at large lattice sizes . a perturbative approach  @xcite observes a very small effect at ninth order . at this time",
    "the issue remains unresolved .",
    "its potential presence in spin glasses is interesting , however , and represents a qualitatively new thermodynamic feature of at least some types of disordered systems .    in this section",
    "we raise the possibility of a far stronger version of ctd , which we will call _ highly _ chaotic temperature dependence  ( hctd )  @xcite .",
    "unlike ` ordinary ' ctd , where correlations behave in a chaotic fashion as temperature changes but the global pure state structure does not , in hctd the number of pure states in the periodic b.c .  metastate does not behave in a continuous or even monotonic fashion as temperature is lowered .",
    "this picture departs radically from any other that has appeared so far in the literature .",
    "the hctd scenario is summarized as follows . as in all other pictures ,",
    "there exists a deterministic @xmath85 for a.e .",
    "@xmath8 , such that for all @xmath196 there is a unique ( paramagnetic ) gibbs state .",
    "suppose one were now to choose an arbitrary ( nonzero ) @xmath197 .",
    "then with probability one ( i.e. , for almost every @xmath8 ) , there is again a unique infinite volume gibbs state ( though maybe not with exponential decay of truncated correlations ) .",
    "nevertheless , as temperature is lowered from @xmath85 to 0 for a fixed typical @xmath8 , there would be a ( countably infinite ) dense set of temperatures , _ depending on @xmath8 _ , with broken symmetric pure phases for that @xmath8 at those temperatures .",
    "now this scenario might be dismissed , with some justification , as the authors fevered imaginings , but it should be noted that just this sort of phenomenon does happen in other disordered systems . consider anderson localization in one dimension , with the random schrdinger operator  @xcite @xmath198 where @xmath199 , @xmath200 is a bounded potential periodic in @xmath140 , and @xmath201 in  ( [ eq : rp ] ) @xmath90 runs over the integers , @xmath202 is a nonegative localized potential centered at lattice site @xmath203 , and the @xmath204 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables uniformly distributed in @xmath205 $ ] .",
    "operators of the type given by  ( [ eq : rso ] ) are known to have certain properties  see , e.g.  @xcite . if one first chooses a specific energy , then for a.e .",
    "realization @xmath206 of the random potential , that energy is part of its continuous spectrum ( i.e. , is not an eigenvalue of @xmath207 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if one first chooses a specific realization @xmath206 , then there is almost surely a ( countable ) dense set of eigenvalues ( in some appropriate energy interval ) of @xmath207 , and of course this set depends on @xmath208 .    returning to the ea  model in ( say ) three dimensions , it is amusing to speculate that a phenomenon like that described above for localization might occur for ea spin glasses , as follows : a ) for every arbitrarily chosen @xmath9 , there is a unique gibbs state for a.e .",
