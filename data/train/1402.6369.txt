    "dilaton fields are expected to play a very important role in the dynamics of the early universe and are present in almost any model which attempts to unify gravity with the ordinary gauge interactions ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "important examples of these constructions are effective field theories derived from strings , describing their massless spectra , but also theories of gravity compactified on extra dimensional spaces , where the dilaton ( graviscalar ) emerges in 4 spacetime dimensions from the extra components of the higher dimensional metric ( see for instance @xcite ) . in these formulations , due to the geometrical origin of these fields , the dilaton is , in general , a fundamental ( i.e. not a composite ) field",
    ". other extensions , also of significant interest , in which a fundamental dilaton induces a gauge connection for the abelian weyl symmetry in a curved spacetime , have been considered ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "however , also in this case , the link of this fundamental particle to gravity renders it a crucial player in the physics of the early universe , and not a particle to be searched for at colliders .",
    "in fact , its interaction with ordinary matter should be suppressed by the planck scale , except if one entails scenarios with large extra dimensions .",
    "more recently , following an independent route , several extensions of the standard model with an _ effective _ dilaton have been considered .",
    "they conjecture the existence of a scale - invariant extension of the higgs sector @xcite . in this case",
    "the breaking of the underlying conformal dynamics , in combination with the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry @xcite , suggests , in fact , that the dilaton could emerge as a composite field , appearing as a nambu - goldstone mode of the broken conformal symmetry .",
    "a massless dilaton of this type could acquire a mass by some explicit potential and could mix with the higgs of the standard model .",
    "+ by reasoning in terms of the conformal symmetry of the standard model , which should play a role at high energy , the dilaton would be the physical manifestation of the trace anomaly in the standard model , in analogy to the pion , which is interpolated by the @xmath5 chiral current and the corresponding @xmath6 ( axial - vector / vector / vector ) interaction in qcd .",
    "as in the @xmath6 case , this composite state should be identified with the anomaly pole of the related anomaly correlator ( the @xmath7 diagram , with @xmath8 the energy momentum tensor ( emt ) ) , at least at the level of the 1-particle irreducible ( 1pi ) anomaly effective action @xcite .",
    "considerations of this nature brings us to the conclusion that the effective massless nambu - goldstone modes which should appear as a result of the existence of global anomalies , should be looked for in specific perturbative form factors under special kinematical limits . for this reason they are easier to investigate in the on - shell anomaly effective action , with a single mass parameter which drives the conformal / superconformal deformation",
    "this action has the advantage of being gauge invariant and easier to compute than its off - shell relative .",
    "we remark , however , that this picture remains limited to perturbation theory and may be drastically modified by the non perturbative dynamics .",
    "the radiative nature of the breaking of a certain global symmetry , as in the case of the anomaly , does not guarantee the massless nature of these modes , which could acquire a nonzero mass .",
    "the extension of this analysis to the superconformal case is particularly interesting in view of recent results concerning the derivation of the superconformal anomaly action for the goldstone supermultiplet in a theory where conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken @xcite . in this case",
    "it has been argued in favour of the existence of a conformal anomaly matching between the broken and the unbroken phases of the superconformal theory .",
    "our results are in line with these previous elaborations .      to take advantage at full scale of the analogy between chiral and conformal anomalies",
    ", one should turn to supersymmetry , where the correlation between poles and anomalies should be more direct .",
    "in fact , in an ordinary quantum field theory , the @xmath7 diagram ( and the corresponding anomaly action ) is characterized , as we are going to show , by pole structures both in those form factors that contribute to the trace anomaly and in those that do nt .",
    "for this reason we turn our attention to the effective action of the superconformal ( the ferrara - zumino , fz ) multiplet , where chiral and conformal anomalies share similar signatures , being part of the same multiplet .",
    "+ we are going to prove rigorously in perturbation theory that the anomaly of the fz multiplet is associated with the exchange of three composite states in the 1pi superconformal anomaly action .",
    "these have been discussed in the past , in the context of the spontaneous breaking of the superconformal symmetry @xcite .",
    "they are identified with the anomaly poles present in the effective action , extracted from a supersymmetric correlator containing the superconformal hypercurrent and two vector currents , and correspond to the dilaton , the dilatino and the axion .",
    "this exchange is identified by a direct analysis of the anomalous correlators in perturbation theory or by the study of the flow of their spectral densities under massive deformations .",
    "the flow describes a 1-parameter family of spectral densities - one family for each component of the correlator - which satisfy mass independent sum rules , and are , therefore , independent of the superpotential .",
    "this behaviour turns a dispersive cut of the spectral density @xmath9 into a pole ( i.e. a @xmath10 contribution ) as the deformation parameter @xmath11 goes to zero .",
    "moreover , denoting with @xmath12 the momentum square of the anomaly vertex , each of the spectral densities induces on the corresponding form factor a @xmath13 behaviour also at large @xmath12 , as a consequence of the sum rule .",
    "+ we also recall that the partnership between dilatons and axions is not new in the context of anomalies , and it has been studied in the past - for abelian gauge anomalies - in the case of the supersymmetric stckelberg multiplet @xcite .",
    "+ the three states associated to the three anomaly poles mentioned above are described - in the perturbative picture - by the exchange of two collinear particles .",
    "these correspond to a fermion / antifermion pair in the axion case , a fermion / antifermion pair and a pair of scalar particles in the dilaton case , and a collinear scalar / fermion pair for the dilatino .",
    "the konishi current will be shown to follow an identical pattern and allows the identification of extra states , one for each fermion flavour present in the theory .",
    "+ this pattern appears to be general in the context of anomalies , and unique in the case of supersymmetry .",
    "in fact , we are going to show that in a supersymmetric theory anomaly correlators have a single pole in each component of the anomaly multiplet , a single spectral flow and a single sum rule , proving the existence of a one - to - one correspondence between anomalies and poles in these correlators .",
    "our work is organized as follows .",
    "we first illustrate the motivations of our study by overviewing the analysis of the spectral densities performed in the investigations of the conformal anomaly in the @xmath7 vertex at nonzero momentum transfers in qed @xcite@xcite and qcd @xcite .",
    "the case of a general non - abelian theory , with the inclusion of scalars , is new and is discussed - in the massless case - in section [ tvvsection ] .",
    "this may serve to highlight some specific properties of these types of vertices which have not received sufficient attention in the past .",
    "then we turn to a perturbative study of the effective action in the case of supersymmetric @xmath0 theories , focusing on the components of the fz multiplet and on the corresponding anomalies .",
    "this is followed by a study of the spectral densities of the relevant diagrams which are responsible for the superconformal anomaly .",
    "we show the existence of a unique sum rule for each component of the multiplet , and of a spectral density flow driven by the mass perturbations . as the deformation ( mass )",
    "parameter turns to zero , restoring the superconformal symmetry , the flow gets localized at zero invariant mass , signalling the exchange of a massless pole in the anomaly effective action .",
    "we will compare non supersymmetric and supersymmetric realizations , highlighting the differences between the two cases .",
    "in particular we will show in detail how the cancellation of the extra poles of non anomalous form factors is realized in supersymmetric theories . finally , we present the structure of the anomaly action as a combination of the pole contributions , plus the non anomalous ( logarithmic ) terms . in superspace ,",
    "the first had been identified in the past relying on supersymmetric arguments @xcite .",
    "we will conclude our analysis with some comments on the possible implications of our results about the physical manifestation of anomaly poles - for global anomalous symmetries - and their cancellations in the case of their superconformal gaugings .",
    "as pointed out long ago in the literature on the chiral anomaly @xcite , its perturbative signature is in the appearance of a massless pole ( an anomaly pole ) in the spectrum of the @xmath6 diagram .",
    "the pole is present , in perturbation theory , only in a specific kinematic configuration , namely at zero fermion mass and with on - shell vector lines .",
    "the intermediate state which is exchanged in the effective action , see fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) , and which is mediated by the @xmath6 diagram , is characterized by two massless and collinear fermions moving on the light cone .",
    "it is rather compelling to interpret the appearance of this intermediate configuration - within the obvious limitations of the perturbative picture - as signalling the possible exchange of a bound state in the quantum effective action .    in a phenomenological context , what gives a far broader significance to this kinematical mechanism is the appearance of a certain kinematic _ duality _ , which accompanies any perturbative anomaly . in this case",
    "it is better known as @xmath14-_duality _ , relating the resonance and the asymptotic region of a certain correlator in a nontrivial way @xcite .",
    "this property , in general , finds its justification in the existence of a sum rule for the spectral density @xmath9 .",
    "generically , it is given in the form [ sr ] _",
    "0^(s , m^2 ) ds = f , with the constant @xmath15 independent of any mass ( or other ) parameter which characterizes the thresholds or the strengths of the resonant states eventually present in the integration region @xmath16 .",
    "it should be stressed that sum rules formulated for the study of the structure of the resonances , i.e. their strengths and masses , as in the qcd case , involve a parameterization of the resonant behaviour of @xmath17 at low @xmath18 values , via a phenomenological approach , with the inclusion of the asymptotic behaviour of the correlator , amenable to perturbation theory , for larger @xmath18 .",
    "for this significant interplay between the infrared ( ir ) and the ultraviolet ( uv ) regions , the term _ duality _ is indeed quite appropriate to qualify the implications of a given sum rule .",
    "it was pointed out , some time ago , that one specific tract of the chiral anomaly is in the existence of a sum rule for the @xmath6 diagram @xcite , later extended to a similar study of the trace of the energy momentum tensor ( @xmath19 ) for the @xmath20 in qed ( with @xmath21 a vector current ) , at zero momentum transfers @xcite .",
    "similar analysis were performed on the @xmath22 correlator in 2-dimensional gravity @xcite , which is affected by the trace anomaly .",
    "the analysis brought substantial evidence that the sum rule , combined with the original identification of the anomaly pole from the perturbative spectral density @xcite , were two important and related aspects of the anomaly phenomenon .",
    "we recall that the study of these types of correlators has a quite long history @xcite .",
    "more recently , very general perturbative analysis of the @xmath7 correlator ( or graviton - gauge - gauge vertex ) , performed off - shell and at nonzero momentum transfer , have shown that the general features observed in the @xmath6 and @xmath20 cases where preserved @xcite .",
    "+ a specific feature of the spectral density of the chiral and conformal anomalies is that the pole is introduced in the spectrum in a specific kinematical limit , as a degeneracy of the two - particle cut when any second scale ( for instance the fermion mass ) is sent to zero .",
    "the property of the _ cut turning into a pole _ is peculiar to finite ( non superconvergent ) sum rules .",
    "it is related to a spectral density which is normalized by the sum rule just like an ordinary weighted distribution , and whose support is located at the edge of the allowed phase space ( @xmath23 ) as the conformal deformation turns to zero .",
    "this allows to single out a unique interpolating state out of all the possible exchanges permitted in the continuum , i.e. for @xmath24 , as the theory flows towards its conformal / superconformal point .",
    "as we have just mentioned , the existence of a sum rule for the form factor responsible for a certain anomaly indicates a uv / ir connection manifested by the corresponding spectral density , but it is not exclusively related , obviously , to the anomaly phenomenon .",
    "in fact , non anomalous form factors , in some cases , as we are going to show next , share a similar behaviour .",
    "we would expect , though , that the breaking of a symmetry should manifest in the apperance of a massless state in the spectrum of the effective theory , and in this respect the saturation of the spectral density with a single resonance in an anomaly form factor acquires a special status . elaborating on eq .",
    "( [ sr ] ) , one can show that the effect of the anomaly is , in general , related to the behaviour of the spectral density at any values of @xmath18 , although , in some kinematical limits , it is the region around the light cone ( @xmath25 ) which dominates the sum rule , and amounts to a resonant contribution .",
    "in fact , the combination of the scaling behaviour of the corresponding form factor @xmath26 ( equivalently of its density @xmath27 ) with the requirement of integrability of the spectral density , essentially fix @xmath15 to be a constant and the sum rule ( [ sr ] ) to be saturated by a single massless resonance . obviously , a superconvergent sum rule , obtained for @xmath28 , would not share this behaviour . at the same time , _ the absence of subtractions _ in the dispersion relations guarantees the significance of the sum rule , being this independent of any ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "it is quite straightforward to show that eq .",
    "( [ sr ] ) is a constraint on asymptotic behaviour of the related form factor . the proof is obtained by observing that the dispersion relation for a form factor in the spacelike region ( @xmath29 ) f(q^2,m^2)=_0^ ds , once we expand the denominator in @xmath14 as @xmath30 and make use of eq .",
    "( [ sr ] ) , induces the following asymptotic behaviour on @xmath31 _",
    "q^2 q^2 f(q^2 , m^2)=f .",
    "[ asym ] the @xmath32 behaviour at large @xmath14 , with @xmath15 independent of @xmath11 , shows the pole dominance of @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "the uv / ir conspiracy of the anomaly , discussed in @xcite , is in the reappearance of the pole contribution at very large value of the invariant @xmath14 , even for a nonzero mass @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , as we are going to show in the following sections , the spectral density has support around the @xmath23 region @xmath35 , as in the massless @xmath36 case . this point is quite subtle , since the flows of the spectral densities with @xmath11 show the decoupling of the anomaly pole for a nonzero mass . here , the term _ decoupling _ will be used to refer to the non resonant behaviour of @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , the presence of a @xmath37 term in the anomaly form factors is a property of the entire flow which a ) converges to a localized massless state ( i.e. @xmath38 ) as @xmath39 , while b ) the presence of a non vanishing sum rule guarantees the validity of the asymptotic constraint illustrated in eq . ( [ asym ] ) .",
    "notice that although for conformal deformations driven by a single mass parameter the independence of the asymptotic value @xmath15 on @xmath11 is a simple consequence of the scaling behaviour of @xmath31 , it holds quite generally even for a completely off - shell kinematics @xcite .    in summary , in complete agreement with a previous analysis by giannotti and mottola @xcite",
    ", we are going to verify that for a generic supersymmetric @xmath0 theory , the two basic features of the anomalous behaviour of a certain form factor responsible for chiral or conformal anomalies are : 1 ) the existence of a spectral flow which turns a dispersive cut into a pole as @xmath11 goes to zero and 2 ) the existence of a sum rule which relates the asymptotic behaviour of the anomaly form factor to the strength of the pole resonance .",
    "+ in a supersymmetric theory this correspondence , as we are going to show , is unique , since the only poles present in the explicit expressions are those of the anomaly form factors .",
    "this feature is shared also by the @xmath6 in non supersymmetric theories , where one can identify a single pole in the related form factor , a single sum rule and a single spectral density flow . in the @xmath7 diagram , for a general field theory , instead",
    ", this feature is absent .",
    "the appearance of extra poles in the form factors of the traceless parts of this second correlators leaves unanswered the question about the physical meaning of these additional singularities @xcite . on the other end",
    ", the effective massless states emerging from the anomaly sectors should be identified with the nambu - goldstone modes of the corresponding broken symmetries , which are such because of non conserved dilatation and chiral currents .",
    "the reason for turning to supersymmetry should be obvious .",
    "one expects , in general , that the perturbative structure of the chiral and conformal @xcite anomalies , in this case , should be similar .",
    "this should occur for a supersymmetric anomaly multiplet , where both the @xmath7 and the @xmath6-like diagrams are components of the same anomalous correlator . at the same time , we expect to recover , for each single component , the properties found in the past , separately in the chiral and in the conformal cases @xcite , but , hopefully , without the extra poles present in the non anomalous tensor structures and form factors of @xmath7 . + we are going to prove , by an explicit computation , that this is indeed the case .",
    "we also stress the fact that our analysis , in particular in the @xmath7 case , is entirely performed at nonzero momentum transfer , working with the insertion of the uncontracted @xmath8 , rather than with its trace , as done in @xcite .",
    "the study is centered around the @xmath40 correlator , in @xmath41 and @xmath42 theories , containing the hypercurrent @xmath1 ( the ferrara - zumino multiplet @xcite ) and two vector supercurrents @xmath2 .",
    "we will show that the two requirements enunciated above are satisfied by every component of this multiplet .",
    "however , before moving to the supersymmetric case , we briefly review the results of the computation of the @xmath43 in an ordinary non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "this may serve to illustrate the differences between an ordinary gauge theory and its supersymmetric version , which has triggered the current analysis .",

    "it natural to turn to the @xmath293 theory , which is free of anomalies , in order to verify and validate this reasoning . indeed",
    "the @xmath4 function of the gauge coupling constant in this theory has been shown to vanish up to three loops @xcite , and there are several arguments about its vanishing to all the perturbative orders . as a consequence ,",
    "the anomaly coefficient in the trace of the energy - momentum tensor , being proportional to the @xmath4 function , must vanish identically and the same occurs for the other anomalous component , related to the @xmath63 and to the @xmath294 currents in the ferrara - zumino supermultiplet .",

    "+ notice also that the only surviving contribution in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) , proportional to the traceless tensor structure @xmath301 , is finite .",
    "this is due to the various cancellations between the uv singular terms from @xmath292 and @xmath136 which give a finite correlator without the necessity of any regularization .",
    "we recall that the cancellation of infinities and the renormalization procedure , as we have already seen in the @xmath41 case , involves only the form factor of tensor @xmath301 , which gets renormalized with a counterterm proportional to that of the two - point function @xmath302 , and hence to the gauge coupling . for this reason",
    "the finiteness of the second form factor and then of the entire @xmath7 in @xmath42 is directly connected to the vanishing of the anomalous term , because its non - renormalization naturally requires that the @xmath4 function has to vanish .",
    "our analysis and results show the consistency of a conjecture about the perturbative structure of the anomalies in supersymmetric theories , formulated by us in previous works @xcite . we have presented additional evidence that anomaly poles are the signature of the anomalies in the perturbative anomaly action of these theories , extending former studies @xcite . for global anomalies",
    "it is expected that the massless states identified by the pole contributions can be promoted to new composite degrees of freedom by some non perturbative dynamics , as for the chiral anomaly and the pion .",
    "+ in the qcd case @xcite , for instance , the breaking of classical scale invariance - in this perturbative picture - should manifest in the emergence of a dilaton , if gluons were asymptotic states .",
    "we have noticed , though , that the @xmath7 vertex in qcd , as we have shown , has one extra pole and and one extra flow related to a non anomalous form factor which is both ir and uv safe , which should be interpreted as an extra interpolating state .",
    "a similar perturbative pattern emerges in the standard model @xcite , as clear from the analysis of the conformal anomaly in the electroweak sector @xcite .",
    "+ however , by turning to supersymmetry , we have shown that here the connection between anomalies , poles and sum rules for anomaly vertices are one to one .",
    "the @xmath303 feature of the anomaly form factors has been investigated in connection with the scaling properties of their spectral densities and with the finite ( non zero ) sum rule which it satisfies , in agreement with a previous analysis by giannotti and mottola @xcite .",
    "we have seen that the anomalous behaviour emerges from the @xmath25 region of the spectral density of a given form factor and covers , therefore , the entire light - cone surface .",
    "the resonant behaviour at @xmath23 is present , as we have shown , also at very high momentum .",
    "+ in supersymmetry we have focused our attention on the perturbative correlators which are responsible for the generation of the superconformal anomaly , and shown that the ferrara - zumino multiplet , as well as the konishi currents , allow to identify some composite states in the effective action , interpolating between the currents and the on - shell final states .",
    "they correspond to a dilaton , a dilatino and an axion , plus a number of pseudoscalar states , one for each fermion flavour . the description of these effective degrees of freedom not as anomaly poles but as asymptotic states of the s - matrix remains , obviously , an open issue , which goes beyond the simple perturbative picture discussed here , as demonstrated by the complex pattern of chiral dynamics in qcd .",
    "in particular would be interesting to compare this result with the anomaly action obtained in @xcite in the superconformal case , which is of wess - zumino type , which is local .",
    "we expect both actions to share the same physical content .",
    "following this pattern , it is then natural to ask if global anomalies are always connected to the generation of effective degrees of freedom , and hence to compositeness , as indicated by the poles of the effective action . these results are valid for all the anomalies characterized by a single flow , in particular for all the chiral currents affected by global anomalies . from this perspective , also the peccei - quinn current should induce as an interpolating state a composite axion rather an elementary one , being our argument generic to anomalous global currents .",
    "we stress once again , that all our results are limited to perturbation theory .",
    "obviously , nonperturbative effects may change drastically this picture , as in the case of the @xmath304 in qcd . in general , indeed , one expects the appearance of massless poles in the spontaneous breaking of global symmetries and not in those driven by radiative effects , as in the case of anomalies .",
    "for this reason mass corrections related to non perturbative effects should modify this picture by shifting the position of these poles which could become massive .",
    "there are also some drastic implications of our analysis , at least in the supersymmetric case , whenever the symmetries of the hypercurrent are gauged , which concern the way anomalies should cancel when a theory affected by a superconformal anomaly is coupled to gravity .",
    "we have seen that the anomaly is entirely given by the @xmath305 term , in terms of the @xmath4 function of the theory , and it appears obvious that the coupling to gravity has necessarily to provide an extra massless sector in order to remove such contribution .",
    "this could only take place if the gravitational sector can contribute by an equal and opposite amount to the pole residue , at the cost , otherwise , of being left with an inconsistency in the total theory .",
    "it is important to remark , as we have already pointed out , that the cancellation of the pole may not be an identical cancellation of the anomaly vertex .",
    "we have in fact explicitly shown that in a @xmath286 theory , for instance , by setting the @xmath4 function to zero , one indeed is canceling the pole contributions , and hence the anomaly , but not the entire anomaly vertex , as clear from eq .",
    "( [ residualv ] ) .",
    "this situation is new compared to the case of anomalous abelian symmetries , where anomaly cancellation by charge assignments on the massless matter spectrum forces the entire @xmath306 vertices to vanish . + it is important to stress , at this point , that there are subtle issues related to the definition of the anomaly supermultiplet in general theories , of which the ferrara - zumino choice is only one realization .",
    "for instance , in the presence of fayet - iliopoulos terms the multiplet is not gauge invariant and requires an appropriate redefinition .",
    "similar issues appear in theories with a khler form that is not exact , as discussed in recent works @xcite , @xcite , @xcite.these issues have particular relevance in the investigation of the coupling of these theories to supergravity . in @xcite , for instance , it is shown that it is always possible to construct a new supermultiplet which generalizes the fz - multiplet .",
    "however , being our analysis limited to a non - abelian gauge theory with a simple khler potential , the pathologies described above are not present . in our case",
    "the ferrara - zumino supermultiplet is a good operator of the theory . of course",

    "<S> we discuss the signature of the anomalous breaking of the superconformal symmetry in @xmath0 super yang mills theory , mediated by the ferrara - zumino hypercurrent ( @xmath1 ) with two vector ( @xmath2 ) supercurrents @xmath3 and its manifestation in the anomaly action , in the form of anomaly poles . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to investigate in a unified way both conformal and chiral anomalies . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is performed in parallel to the standard model , for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate , in particular , massive deformations of the @xmath0 theory and the spectral densities of the anomaly form factors which are extracted from the components of this correlator . in this extended framework </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that all the anomaly form factors are characterized by spectral densities which flow with the mass deformation . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the continuum contributions from the two - particle cuts of the intermediate states turn into into poles in the zero mass limit , with a single sum rule satisfied by each component . </S>",
    "<S> non anomalous form factors , instead , in the same anomalous correlators , are characterized by non - integrable spectral densities . </S>",
    "<S> these tend to uniform distributions as one moves towards the conformal point , with a clear dual behaviour . as in a previous analysis of the dilaton pole of the standard model , </S>",
    "<S> also in this case the poles can be interpreted as signaling the exchange of a composite dilaton / axion / dilatino ( add ) multiplet in the effective lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> the pole - like behaviour of the anomaly form factors is shown to be a global feature of the correlators , present at all energy scales , due to the sum rules . </S>",
    "<S> a similar behaviour is shown to be present in the konishi current , which identifies additional composite states . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that global anomalous currents characterized by a single flow in the perturbative picture always predict the existence of composite interpolating fields . in case of gauging of these currents , as in superconformal theories coupled to gravity </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the cancellation of the corresponding anomalies requires either a vanishing @xmath4 function or the inclusion of an extra gravitational sector which effectively sets the residue at the anomaly poles of the gauged currents to vanish .    * superconformal sum rules and the spectral density flow + of the composite dilaton ( add ) multiplet in @xmath0 theories *    _ dipartimento di matematica e fisica `` ennio de giorgi '' , universit del salento and + infn - lecce , via arnesano , 73100 lecce , italy _ + </S>"
