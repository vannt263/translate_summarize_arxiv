    "pairs of extrasolar giant planets in a mean motion commensurability are a common occurrence .",
    "it has been estimated that sixth of multi - planet systems detected by the radial velocity technique are in or close to a 2:1 commensurability ( wright et al .",
    "parameters for some cases of interest that are considered in this paper are shown in table [ table1 ] ( for additional examples see e.g. emelyanenko 2012 ) .",
    "in addition there are two known systems in 3:2 resonance ( correia et al .",
    "2009 , rein et al .",
    "2012 , robertson et al .",
    "2012a ) and one in a 4:3 resonance ( johnson et al .",
    "2011 , rein et al .",
    "2012 ) consistent with the systems in 2:1 resonance being the most commonly observed commensurability .",
    "the existence of these resonant systems indicates that dissipative mechanisms that result in changes to planet semi- major axes that produce related changes to period ratios in planetary systems have operated .",
    "this is because the probability of forming resonant configurations in situ is expected to be small ( e.g. beauge et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "disc - planet interaction can produce the required evolution of the semi - major axes .",
    "this may result in convergent migration leading to the formation of a commensurability ( see baruteau et al .",
    "2014 and references therein ) . accordingly understanding the observed configuration of such systems has the potential for either revealing how disc - planet interactions may have operated or for ruling them out .",
    "previous numerical studies of commensurabilities forming and evolving as a result of disc - planet interactions have focused on systems such as gj 876 , hd 45364 and hd 6805 interacting with disc modelled with either constant kinematic viscosity , or with the @xmath0-viscosity parameter of shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) taken to be constant ( for a review see baruteau et al .",
    "2014 and references therein ) . in this paper",
    "we extend such studies , considering systems with orbital parameters similar to those of hd 155358 ( robertson et al .",

    "we perform 2d and 3d numerical simulations of pairs of giant planets interacting with a protoplanetary disc that attain a mean motion commensurability for up to @xmath2 orbital periods of the inner planet .",
    "we investigate whether such systems could have originated at larger radii beyond the ice line and then migrated inwards , the commensurability possibly being formed in the same neighbourhood .",

    "the first three either are or possibly in 2:1 resonance while the fourth is in a 3:1 resonance .",
    "the first column identifies the system , the second column gives the mass of the central star in solar masses .",
    "the third and fourth columns give the masses of the planets in jupiter masses and the fifth and sixth columns give their semi - major axes in au . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in order to study the role of the nature of the underlying disc model we consider models with an inner mri active region producing a significant effective viscosity and an outer inactive region for which a significant effective viscosity may occur only in the upper layers of the disc ( gammie 1996 ) as well as models with a uniform @xmath0-viscosity prescription throughout .",
    "we also consider models with different surface density scaling corresponding to varying the total disc mass or equivalently the steady state accretion rate . in this way",
    "the disc - planet interaction at different stages of the life of the protoplanetary disc can be studied with lower mass discs corresponding to later stages ( e.g. calvet et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we find that when low mass disc models are considered , systems with planets in the jovian mass range maintain a 2:1 commensurability while undergoing inward type ii migration .",
    "this is found to be at a rate such that formation at a few au from the central star and migration to their current locations on a time scale comparable to the expected protoplanetary disc lifetime is possible in principle .",
    "we find that there is a relative insensitivity of results to the disc model employed and find good agreement between 2d and 3d simulations .",
    "planets containing larger masses such as the hd 60532 system which is observed to be in 3:1 resonance ( laskar & correia 2009 ) are found to attain this resonance in low mass low viscosity discs .",
    "we find that for systems with planets in the jovian mass range , increasing the disc mass results in the formation of an unstable 5:3 resonance .",
    "this instability results in the rapid destruction of the commensurability implying that the occurrence of such systems should be less common .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "we give the basic equations and coordinate system used in section [ beq ] . in section [ numsims ]",
    "we outline the numerical methods and computational domains adopted going on to describe aspects of the physical set up and disc models used in sections [ discmod ] and [ layered ] .",

    "the azimuthal grid spacing was uniform and such that @xmath29 we remark that disc - planet interactions adopting similar resolutions to those adopted here have been carried out for lower mass planets by kley et al .",
    "the interval @xmath30 was chosen such that there were six grid cells per scale height .",
    "planet gravitational potentials were softened by adopting a gravitational softening length taken to be @xmath31 hill radii , being slightly less than two radial grid cells in extent , and the smoothing filter of crida et al .",

    "( 2009a ) was employed when calculating torques acting on planets for this case also .",
    "the convergence of two dimensional simulations was checked by performing them at twice the resolution with the softening procedure remaining fixed .    as we consider either low viscosity discs or discs undergoing steady state accretion at very low accretion rates , we neglect accretion onto the planet .",
    "many of our runs are carried out with planets migrating in discs with local kinematic viscosity @xmath42 in dimensionless units . accretion onto the planet has been found to be a small effect in this case ( bryden et al .",
    "1999 , kley 1999 ) .",
    "in addition the time required for the accretion rate through the disc to double the planet s mass is significantly longer than the migration time when larger viscosities are considered ( see below ) .      for global simulations that need to be run for long times such as those we perform , constraints on numerical resolution",
    "are such that small scale turbulence associated with angular momentum transport has to be modelled through an effective viscosity prescription . to do this",
    "we adopt an @xmath0-viscosity prescription ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) . for this",
    "the kinematic viscosity @xmath43 the value of @xmath0 to be adopted depends on the expected level of turbulence and this in turn depends on the operation of the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) ( balbus & hawley 1991 ) .",
    "it is expected that there will be an inner mri active zone together with an outer dead zone which may have active surface layers ( gammie 1996 ) .",
    "small scale hydrodynamic instabilities such as the vertical shear instability may also contribute in the absence of the mri ( nelson , gressel & umurhan 2013 ) .",
    "the location of the interface between these regions depends on details of the transition from magnetohydrodynamic stability to instability and is subject to some degree of uncertainty .",
    "latter & balbus ( 2012 ) estimate that it typically occurs at around 0.6 au .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : discmodel ] .",
    "we specify the standard disc model to be such that when the unit of length used to scale our dimensionless units is 1 au and the unit of mass is a solar mass , it corresponds to a steady state model with accretion rate @xmath44 this is near the bottom of the range of accretion rates observed for protoplanetary discs ( calvet et al .",
    "2004 ) and might be expected to occur during their late stages which are the focus of attention here .",
    "however , we have also considered disc models with surface density scaled such that they are up to ten times more massive and accordingly with a steady state accretion rate that is also up to ten times higher .    to allow for an inner mri active region together with an outer region with much less activity , we specify @xmath0 to be a function of @xmath45 thus @xmath46 where    @xmath47    here @xmath48 corresponds to the inner region and @xmath49 corresponds to the outer zone .",

    "this gives @xmath54 when @xmath0 is constant .      in order to consider the possibility that a significant effective disc viscosity arises only in the upper layers of the outer disc ( e.g. gammie 1996 )",
    ", we have performed simulations for a layered outer disc model . in this model @xmath0",

    "fig : discmodel ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath0 in the upper domain was chosen to be such that the integrated stress in the meridional direction was the same as for an outer disc model with @xmath0 independent of @xmath20 ( see pierens & nelson 2010 ) . in practice",
    "the value of @xmath0 in the upper layers of the layered model was thus found to be @xmath57 times larger then the value for the corresponding non layered model .",
    "for three dimensional models , the disc equilibrium pressure is given by @xmath58 here @xmath59 and the function @xmath60 can be chosen to match a prescribed surface density or alternatively mid plane pressure or density .     does not vary with @xmath20 or height in the disc .",
    "the value of @xmath0 then decreases sharply from @xmath61 to @xmath62 as the transition radius is passed through . for the layered model @xmath0",
    "is only non zero for @xmath21 \\equiv [ \\theta_{\\mathrm{min } } , \\pi/2 ] $ ] in the outer disc . ]      in the simulations presented here the density or surface density was modified such that any planets were initially placed within gaps .",
    "the initial orbital evolution would differ if the planets were initially embedded .",
    "however , because our goal is to measure steady state migration rates , this is not a problem . thus the simulations are assumed to commence after any gaps have been formed . in this way we avoid having to simulate an uncertain initial phase during which gaps are formed .",
    "the procedure we adopted was to reduce the density or surface density by a constant factor in the interval @xmath63 $ ] where @xmath64 is the initial orbital radius of the planet , being assumed to be in a circular orbit .",
    "this profile was then joined to the original through linear connections in the intervals @xmath65 $ ] and @xmath66.$ ] the gap reduction factor was taken to be a factor of ten in most cases , being a factor of one hundred for cases with planets with final masses exceeding @xmath67 jupiter masses .",
    "in addition the planets were held in fixed circular orbits for two hundred orbits before being released .",
    "their masses were built up to their final values over the first twenty orbits using the procedure given by de val - borro et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "the results obtained with the unit of radius chosen to be the initial orbital radius of the inner planet can be scaled to apply to arbitrary radii .",
    "this is done by noting that results are invariant if the length scale is multiplied by @xmath68 the time scale is multiplied by @xmath69 and the mass scale left unaltered . to be consistent with this the surface density",
    "should be reduced by a factor @xmath70 if regions of the disc are connected in this way the situation does not correspond to a steady state disc .",
    "however , this is not unreasonable if it is applied at radii where the age or evolution time of the system is less than the local viscous time scale . for our standard disc model",
    "this would be the case for length scale exceeding 2 au and age @xmath71 .",
    "we note that when applied , the scaling procedure shifts the transition radius between the active and inactive regions while its location should in principle remain constant . however , this is not a problem as we find an insensitivity of our results to the location of the transition radius as long as the planets migrate in the outer disc ( see below ) .",
    "the planets in the simulations presented here are massive enough to make deep gaps in the disc surface density profile .",
    "accordingly they undergo type ii migration ( e.g. lin & papaloizou 1986 , lin & papaloizou 1993 , baruteau et al .",
    "the rate of migration is governed by the viscous time scale and the disc mass within a radial scale comparable to its orbital radius , @xmath45 baruteau et al .",
    "( 2014 ) estimate the migration rate of a planet of mass @xmath72 as @xmath73 where @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a viscous time scale .",
    "thus when the planet mass becomes large the evolution rate slows on account of the inertia of the planet .",
    "note that ivanov et al .",
    "( 1999 ) obtain a faster rate than implied by equation ( [ typ2 ] ) , finding that the second term in the brackets appears taken to a fractional power .",
    "the rate is faster because disc material tends to pile up near the outer gap edge increasing the angular momentum flux that the planet needs to provide in order to maintain it .",
    "because our simulations of planet - disc interaction with the ` pluto ` code were implemented from scratch , we begin by establishing that some of the main results obtained in previous studies are recovered with our code . in particular we focus on the much studied gj 876 system ( see e.g. snellgrove et al .",

    "we investigate it in order to check that it is the model for which the closest commensurability is attained as indicated by the discussion at the beginning of section [ stdrun ] .",

    "while the system in the 3:2 resonance the mean migration rate is approximately @xmath148 faster than for the previous case .",
    "as expected the closest commensurability was attained in this case .      in order to examine the effect of changing the magnitude of the viscosity , a comparison of the semi - major axis evolution for different 2d runs is given in fig .",
    "[ fig500 ] . for these runs the value of @xmath0 in the outer inactive region was increased and decreased by a factor of two as compared to the standard run , while the surface density was scaled such as to maintain the same steady state accretion rate as for the standard run .",

    "the quantities plotted in the different panels are as in fig .",
    "we see that the migration rate decreases with decreasing viscosity as expected but somewhat less steeply than linearly .",
    "this is because the migration rate has a dependence on the disc surface density profile which takes a long time to evolve , especially in the case with the smallest viscosity .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5000 ] we present a 2d run for which the initial conditions were as in the standard case except that the value of @xmath0 in the inner active region was increased from @xmath149 to @xmath150 .",

    "we remark that the planets are migrating in the inactive part of the disc .",

    "[ fig20 ] we give the results for a simulation for which the mass ratio of the outer planet was increased by a factor of two and its starting distance was increased from @xmath151 to @xmath67 in dimensionless units otherwise initial conditions are as in the standard model .",

    "this was done so as to make the disc mass in the neighbourhood of the outer planet the same as in the standard case .",
    "in addition , the grid outer boundary was shifted from 3.75 to 4.4 such that it was kept distant enough from the outermost planet .",
    "bearing in mind the observational uncertainties , the mass ratio being larger for the outer planet in this system allows it to potentially resemble the hd 6805 system .",
    "this run attains a 2:1 resonance and migrates inward with the two resonant angles ultimately librating around zero and such that @xmath152 inner planet initial orbital periods .",
    "this characteristic time is close to that found for the standard run and so a very similar discussion will follow ( see section [ disc ] ) .",
    "we have also studied a case with planet masses chosen to correspond to the hd 60532 system ( see table [ table1 ] ) where the planets have been found to be in a 3:1 resonance ( see laskar & correia , 2009 ) .    the results of the simulations are shown in fig .",

    "the quantities plotted in the different panels correspond to those in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] except that the right lowermost panel shows the resonant angle @xmath153 this is found to exhibit large amplitude librations about @xmath144 as does the angle @xmath154 the behaviour of the angles that we find here is similar to that presented by laskar & correia ( 2009 ) .",
    "note that the two planets speed up their joint inward migration slightly between @xmath155 and @xmath156 while their mean eccentricities decrease slightly .",
    "as the rate of growth of eccentricity increases with the rate of convergent migration as the planets become closer to resonance ( e.g. papaloizou 2003 , baruteau & papaloizou 2013 ) , this is an indication that the planets are tending to converge more slowly rather than there being an increase in the damping rate of their eccentricities . that in turn can be traced to a tendency of the inner planet to increase its rate of migration inwards at late times unlike in most other 2d cases where an inner planet is pushed by an outer planet .",
    "note that in this case the difference is that the inner planet is more massive and so more effective at clearing away the inner disc which opposes its inward migration ,    we remark that this system has been considered by sndor & kley ( 2010 ) .",
    "they considered a disc with the same aspect ratio and approximately the same mass interior to the inner planet as considered here .",
    "however the viscosity parameter @xmath157 throughout corresponding to a much larger viscosity than we consider for our standard model disc .",
    "they found that the planets attained a 3:1 resonant configuration with @xmath158 orbits . in our case this time is extended to 60,000 initial inner planet orbits .",
    "this is discussed further below .",
    "[ sec : disc ]    in this paper we have performed 2d and 3d simulations of pairs of giant planets that have attained a mean motion resonance in a protoplanetary disc . we considered disc models both with an inner active region and an outer inactive region with lower effective viscosity as well as disc models incorporating only one of these regions .",
    "different magnitudes for the viscosity in both regions were considered .",
    "this was found to have only minor effects on the results as long as the surface density was scaled such as to maintain the same steady state accretion rate  or equivalently , outward directed angular momentum flux , and this scaling did not result in the surface density becoming so small that the planet mass dominated its local neighbourhood .",
    "disc models with a range of masses corresponding to a range of accretion rates were considered , the smallest corresponding to the late stages of the protoplanetary disc life time .",
    "simulations were run for up to 20,000 initial orbits of the inner planet .",
    "when the mass ratio for both planets was @xmath149 , a 2:1 commensurability was maintained for small enough disc masses . for our standard case with a low mass disc and a corresponding steady state accretion rate of @xmath159",
    "the inward migration time @xmath120 inner planet initial orbital periods is a characteristic viscous time scale and so corresponds to standard type ii migration .",
    "noting that observed parameters are somewhat uncertain , those for this model may approximately correspond to those for hd 155358 and 24 sextantis ( see table [ table1 ] ) if the inner planet semi - major axis is respectively taken to be 0.64 au and 1.33 au respectively .",
    "the inward migration times are then respectively @xmath160 and @xmath161 which are relatively short compared to a characteristic protoplanetary disc life time . for illustrative purposes ,",
    "let us assume the planets have migrated in resonance for a time , @xmath76 and use the scaling procedure given in section [ scaling ] to estimate the initial radius of the inner planet .",
    "for either of the two examples we obtain @xmath162 for @xmath163 we note that this is beyond the ice line , with location estimated at about 2.7 au from a solar mass star ( see e.g. martin & livio 2013 ) .",
    "but we emphasise that the scaling used restricts the disc model such that @xmath164 while this might be relaxed to some extent the surface density can not exceed this projection by a large amount because a commensurability with period ratio closer to unity would be formed ( see below ) .    however , we note that the quoted eccentricity for the inner planet in hd 155358 is @xmath165 ( robertson et al",
    ". 2012b ) .",
    "the mean value is exceeded for the standard run at @xmath166 orbits after going into resonance with the implication that the planets could not have been in resonance longer than this time . if this is the case the above discussion would have to be modified to allow the planets to migrate independently from larger radii before converging on to resonance close to their final locations .",
    "this is likely to need to be considered for different possible exterior disc models and in addition the planets may have built up their masses as they went ( see e.g. tadeu dos santos et al .",
    "these considerations are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "nonetheless , because the migration rates for single planets and the resonantly coupled planets are in general similar , the estimated starting radii would also be similar for disc models that are similar to those we considered .",
    "but note that the attained eccentricities depend on the eccentricity damping rates which depend on the details of the disc model ( see crida et al .",
    "for example , we found that for the same amount of relative resonant migration , the entirely inactive disc model led to smaller eccentricities while the 3d layered model led to larger eccentricities .",
    "thus it is important to note that there is uncertainty as to how long the planets could have been in resonance . in the same context",
    "we comment that migration in the completely active disc model was slower by a factor @xmath167 compared to the standard case on account of its lower mass , that being determined so as to maintain the same steady state accretion rate as in the standard case .",
    "furthermore the potential importance a residual inner gaseous disc for damping the eccentricity of the inner planet and so preventing the eccentricities of both planets from continuing to increase in the later stages of the orbital evolution has been stressed by crida et al .",
    "in addition murray et al .",
    "( 2002 ) indicate that a residual disc of planetesimals could produce a similar effect .",
    "we undertook 3d simulations that incorporated consideration of the vertical structure of the disc . both models that adopted a viscosity that was independent of @xmath20 and layered models for which a viscosity was only applied in the upper portion of the @xmath20 domain",
    "were considered .",
    "the orbital evolution that was obtained was found to be in good agreement with that obtained from corresponding 2d simulations .",
    "one effect seen in the 3d simulations that can not be recovered from the 2d simulations is the vertical flow towards the mid - plane in the interior neighbourhood of the planet .",
    "however , because this occurs in the gap region where the density is very low , this does not lead to significant departures from the 2d results for the orbital evolution .    in order to consider a system resembling the hd 6805 system",
    ", we performed a simulation identical to the standard one except that the mass of the outer planet was increased by a factor of two .",
    "this behaved like the standard case with maintenance of a 2:1 commensurability and an inward migration rate @xmath152 inner planet initial orbital periods . using the same scaling argument as above",
    ", the inner planet can be estimated to start at a radius being @xmath168 if resonant migration is assumed for @xmath169      we have also studied a case with planet masses chosen to correspond to the hd 60532 system which has the larger planet mass ratios @xmath170 and @xmath171 ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "these planets are observed to be in a 3:1 resonance ( laskar & correia , 2009 ) . in our simulation ,",
    "the planets attained a 3:1 resonant configuration with @xmath172 initial inner orbits .",
    "for the purposes of an illustrative discussion , if we assume that the scaling to larger radii discussed in section [ scaling ] applies , we find that if the system arrived in its present location after having undergone inward migration in resonance for @xmath173 , it should have started with the inner planet at an orbital radius of @xmath174 au . for a shorter evolution time of @xmath175 the corresponding starting location shifts to 4 au .",
    "however , note that as the orbital configuration obtained in the simulation is like that observed , the two planets may have only spent a relatively small time in resonance , comparable to our simulation run time of @xmath176 orbits . in that case",
    "the planets could have migrated independently , starting at initial radii that did not differ by a large factor on account of the single planet migration rates being comparable .",
    "if this is the case , detection of the system in resonance would be unlikely .",
    "on the other hand only one system of this kind is currently known .",
    "when the surface density or equivalently the steady state accretion rate was increased , the character of the migration of the resonantly coupled pairs of jupiter mass planets changed . when it was increased by a factor of 5 the planets",
    "are found to enter a 5:3 resonance which became unstable after about 5000 orbits leading to a planet - planet scattering as was found by lee et al .",
    "( 2009 ) who adopted an n body approach",
    ". the unstable character of the 5:3 resonance makes the observed occurrence of such a resonances less likely than a 2:1 resonance .",
    "if pairs of planets formed at a few au and then migrated to their present locations with the inner planet being at around 1 au ( such as for the hd 155358 and 24 sextantis systems ) while maintaining a 2:1 commensurability for a characteristic time comparable to the disc life time , the disc should have a low mass as might occur during the later stages of a protoplanatary disc lifetime .",
    "we have found that a disc with significantly larger mass produce an unstable 5:3 resonance resulting in its observed occurrence being less likely .",
    "although 3:2 resonances may be produced in other situations ( eg .",
    "rein et al .",
    "2010 and see the end of section [ incsig ] above ) characteristic evolution times are again short .",
    "finally consideration of systems containing a pair of giant planets with the innermost one being significantly more massive , for which the mechanism outlined by masset & snelgrove ( 2001 ) may operate more efficiently should be undertaken but is beyond the scope of this paper .",
