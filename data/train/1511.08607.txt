    "over the last few decades the phase diagram of water in the high - pressure region has attracted great interest in condensed matter physics and chemistry , as well as in planetary sciences @xcite .",
    "this is due , apart from the fundamental character of water , to the large variety of ice polymorphs which have been found under different conditions of pressure ( @xmath0 ) and temperature ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the phase diagram of water is currently known up to @xmath2 1000 k and @xmath0 in the order of hundreds of gpa @xcite .",
    "ice vii is generally accepted to be the stable phase of water at pressures from 2 to about 60 gpa at room temperature , although some studies predict structural variations of ice vii in this pressure range @xcite .",
    "oxygen atoms in ice vii form a body - centered cubic ( bcc ) structure , with h atoms lying between them , so that each o atom is surrounded by four h atoms , two of which covalently bonded and two h - bonded to it , according to the bernal - fowler rules @xcite . apart from these constraints , the h distribution is disordered over the available lattice sites @xcite .",
    "the resulting h - bond network consists of two independent interpenetrating subnetworks not hydrogen - bonded to each other , each of them topologically equivalent to the h - bond network of cubic ice ic @xcite .",
    "ice vii is believed to be present in various natural environments , such as the earth mantle or icy planets . in this context",
    ", the thermoelastic properties of ice vii and other high - pressure polymorphs can have implications for the dynamics of cold slab subduction in the earth lower mantle , as well as for the evolution of icy planets and satellites @xcite .",
    "this high - pressure water phase has been studied by a variety of techniques , among which one finds x - ray @xcite and neutron @xcite diffraction , as well as vibrational spectroscopy @xcite , brillouin scattering @xcite , electrical conductivity measurements @xcite , and several kinds of calculations @xcite .    at low temperatures ,",
    "ice vii transforms into h - ordered ice viii @xcite . for @xmath3 10 gpa ,",
    "the transition temperature @xmath4 is about 270 k , and for @xmath5 10 gpa , @xmath4 decreases for increasing pressure @xcite . at @xmath6 60 gpa",
    ", ice vii transforms into ice x , where h atoms lie on the middle point between adjacent oxygen atoms , so that the molecular nature of water is no longer preserved .",
    "this phase transition from ice vii to ice x has been found to be caused by quantum proton delocalization @xcite . at higher pressures , other ice phases",
    "have been encountered , and some others are predicted to appear at pressures above 1 tpa @xcite .",
    "computer simulation of condensed phases of water at an atomic level date back to the 1970s @xcite .",
    "in the last few decades , much work has been devoted to the development of empirical potentials to describe both liquid and solid h@xmath7o phases , so that nowadays a large variety of this kind of potentials can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "many of these interatomic potentials assume a rigid geometry for the water molecule , and some others allow for molecular flexibility either with harmonic or anharmonic oh stretches . in recent years , simulations of water using _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft )",
    "have been also carried out @xcite .",
    "it has been observed , however , that a good description of h - bonds in condensed phases of water is a tough job with presently available energy functionals , and some properties can not be accurately reproduced by dft calculations @xcite .",
    "some contributions to improve the description of van der waals interactions in water within the dft formalism have been developed in recent years @xcite .",
    "a limitation of _ ab - initio _ electronic - structure calculations is that they usually deal with atomic nuclei as classical particles , without considering quantum aspects like zero - point motion .",
    "such quantum aspects can be taken into account by using harmonic or quasiharmonic approximations for the nuclear motion , but the precision of these methods is not readily assessed when large anharmonicities are present , as may be the case for light atoms like hydrogen . to consider the quantum character of atomic nuclei , the path - integral molecular dynamics ( or monte carlo ) approach has turned out to be very useful , because in this method the nuclear degrees of freedom can be quantized in an efficient manner , including both thermal and quantum fluctuations in many - body systems at finite temperatures @xcite .",
    "then , a powerful method can consist in combining dft to determine the electronic structure and path integrals to describe the quantum motion of atomic nuclei @xcite .",
    "however , this procedure requires computer resources that may enormously reduce the number of state points that can be considered in actual simulations , as compared to the use of effective interatomic potentials .",
    "effective potential models for condensed phases of water usually treat h@xmath7o molecules as well - defined unbreakable entities , connected by h - bonds .",
    "this prevents their use to study high - pressure phases such as ice x , including symmetric o ",
    "h  o bonds .",
    "this shortcoming does not affect _ ab initio _ potentials , where in principle any bonding configuration or geometry can be studied .",
    "in this line , benoit  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated the influence of nuclear quantum motion in proton ordering and h - bond symmetrization in high - pressure phases of ice , by carrying out path - integral molecular dynamics ( pimd ) simulations with an interatomic interaction given by dft calculations .",
    "more recently , the momentum distribution of protons in ice x was studied by morrone  _ et al . _ @xcite using also _ ab initio _ pimd .",
    "nuclear quantum effects become more relevant for light atomic masses , and are expected to be especially important in the case of hydrogen .",
    "then , we consider the question of how quantum motion of the lightest atom can influence the structural properties of a solid water phase such as ice vii , and in particular if these effects are relevant or detectable for the solid at different densities , i.e. under different external pressures .",
    "this refers to the crystal volume and interatomic distances , but also to the thermodynamic properties of ice . in this respect , it is interesting to estimate the effect of nuclear quantum motion on the stability range of the different ice phases .",
    "thus , it is known that quantum effects change the melting temperature @xmath8 of hexagonal ice ih at ambient pressure by some degrees , as manifested by the isotope effect on @xmath8 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study ice vii by pimd simulations at several pressures and temperatures , in order to analyze its structural and thermodynamic properties .",
    "interatomic interactions are described by the flexible q - tip4p / f model , which was used earlier to carry out pimd simulations of liquid water @xcite , ice ih @xcite , and high - density amorphous ice @xcite .",
    "this potential model has been found to yield a reasonable description of the phase diagram of water up to pressures in the order of 10  gpa @xcite .",
    "the use of a rather accurate effective potential allows us to carry out long pimd simulation runs , and to obtain a good convergence of structural and thermodynamic variables in the @xmath9 region under consideration .",
    "the q - tip4p / f potential model was found to yield reliable results for low - pressure phases such as ice ih @xcite , and it is a goal of the present work to analyze its capability to describe high - pressure phases as ice vii .",
    "a different goal consists in evaluating the reliability of applying a qha to study these phases , by comparing its predictions with results of pimd simulations .",
    "such an approximation has been used earlier to study low - pressure water phases such as ices ih , ii , and iii @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we describe the computational methods and the model used in our calculations .",
    "our results are presented in sec.iii , dealing with the pressure and temperature dependence of molar volume , bulk modulus , o  h interatomic distance , kinetic energy , and atomic delocalization in ice vii .",
    "sec.iv gives a summary of the main results .",
    "we use the pimd method to obtain equilibrium properties of ice vii at various temperatures and pressures .",
    "this method is based on an isomorphism between the real quantum system and a fictitious classical one , that appears after a discretization of the quantum density matrix along cyclic paths @xcite .",
    "such an isomorphism translates in practice into replacing each quantum particle by a ring polymer consisting of @xmath10 ( trotter number ) classical particles , which are connected by harmonic springs with temperature- and mass - dependent force constant .",
    "this isomorphism is exact for @xmath11 , so that a numerical error is introduced by using a finite @xmath10 , which may be corrected by adequate extrapolation of the results to infinite @xmath10 ( see below ) .",
    "details on this simulation technique can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the dynamics considered in the pimd method is artificial , and does not correspond to the actual quantum dynamics of the real particles under consideration .",
    "it is , however , useful for effectively sampling the many - body configuration space , giving precise results for the equilibrium properties of the quantum system .",
    "an alternative way to obtain equilibrium properties is monte carlo sampling , but this procedure requires for our present problem more computer resources ( cpu time ) than the pimd method . in particular , for the latter procedure the codes can be more readily parallelized , which is an important factor for efficient use of modern computer architectures .",
    "ice vii has a body - centered cubic structure with space group @xmath12 and two water molecules per unit cell @xcite .",
    "for the simulations we generated cubic supercells including @xmath13 = 432 water molecules with periodic boundary conditions . in these supercells , hydrogen - disordered ice structures were generated by a monte carlo procedure , in such a way that each oxygen atom had two covalently bonded and two h - bonded hydrogen atoms ( bernal - fowler rules @xcite ) .",
    "it was also imposed that the electric dipole moment of the generated supercells were close to zero @xcite . to quantify the influence of hydrogen disorder on the results presented below , we carried out pimd simulations for six different hydrogen arrangements .",
    "we found that the dispersion of the results found for the different h configurations was smaller than the statistical error bars obtained from simulations for a single h arrangement .",
    "this was taken as an indication that the supercell size considered here was enough to adequately represent the proton disorder in ice vii , in accord with earlier results for this ice phase @xcite .",
    "interatomic interactions have been modeled here by the point charge , flexible q - tip4p / f model , which was applied earlier to study liquid water @xcite , ice @xcite , and water clusters @xcite .",
    "several empirical potentials previously used for simulations of condensed phases of water treat h@xmath7o molecules as rigid bodies @xcite",
    ". this may be convenient for computational efficiency , giving reliable results for various properties of liquid water and ice , but they disregard the contribution of molecular flexibility in the structure and dynamics of condensed phases of water @xcite , aspects which may be relevant for our present purposes . in particular , a flexible water molecule allows us to study correlations between the intramolecular o ",
    "h distance and the geometry of intermolecular h - bonds , known to appear in ice @xcite . also , the appreciable anharmonicity of the intramolecular o ",
    "h vibration is described by anharmonic stretches in the q - tip4p / f potential , which allows to study changes in the intramolecular o ",
    "h distance as a function of temperature and pressure , as well as compare results for classical and quantum simulations ( see below ) .",
    "it has been reported as a limitation of the q - tip4p / f effective potential that it is unable to predict the stability region of the low - pressure phase ice ii @xcite .",
    "this result was derived from free energy calculations based on classical simulations of ices ih , ii , and iii , which indicated that ice ii was not the stable phase in any region of the studied @xmath9 plane ( down to @xmath1 = 200  k ) .",
    "it has been later reported that ice ii appears as the stable phase in a broad region of the phase diagram when nuclear quantum effects are taken into account , basically due to the lower zero - point energy of this water phase , as compared to ices ih and iii @xcite .",
    "this shows that path - integral simulations can help to elucidate structural and thermodynamic aspects of different ice phases , especially in cases where energy ( or free energy ) differences derived from classical calculations turn out to be small .",
    "simulations of ice vii have been carried out here in the isothermal - isobaric @xmath14 ensemble , which allowed us to find the equilibrium volume of the solid at given pressure and temperature .",
    "we used effective algorithms for performing pimd simulations in this statistical ensemble , as those described in the literature @xcite .",
    "in particular , we employed staging variables to define the bead coordinates , and the constant - temperature ensemble was generated by coupling chains of four nos - hoover thermostats to each staging variable .",
    "an additional chain of four barostats was coupled to the volume to yield the required constant pressure,@xcite which was computed along the simulations by using a virial expression adequate for pimd simulations ( see eq .",
    "( 50 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "sampling of the configuration space has been carried out at temperatures between 50 k and 450 k , and pressures between 1 bar and 12 gpa . in some particular cases",
    ", we performed simulations at @xmath1 = 25  k , in order to check the low - temperature convergence of the data . for comparison with results of pimd simulations ,",
    "some classical molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of ice vii have been also carried out .",
    "this can be realized in our context by setting the trotter number @xmath10 = 1 .",
    "other technical details about the simulations presented here are the same as those employed and described earlier in @xcite . the trotter number @xmath10 was taken proportional to the inverse temperature ( @xmath15 ) , so that @xmath16 = 6000  k , which keeps roughly a constant precision in the pimd results at different temperatures . the largest error associated to the finite trotter number @xmath10 is caused by the vibrational modes with highest frequency , i.e. , the intramolecular o ",
    "h stretching modes .",
    "this has been corrected by carrying out some simulations with larger @xmath10 , and extrapolating results of the studied properties for @xmath11 as explained elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the results shown below are the extrapolated ones , after correcting the error due to the finite @xmath10 . in the pimd simulations ,",
    "the time step @xmath17 associated to the calculation of interatomic forces was taken in the range between 0.1 and 0.3 fs , which yielded adequate convergence for the variables studied here .",
    "for given temperature and pressure , a typical simulation run consisted of @xmath18 pimd steps for system equilibration , followed by @xmath19 steps for the calculation of ensemble average properties .",
    "pimd simulations can be used to obtain insight into the atomic delocalization at finite temperatures .",
    "this includes a thermal ( classical ) delocalization , as well as a delocalization associated to the quantum character of the atomic nuclei , which is quantified by the spatial extension of the paths associated to a given atomic nucleus . for each quantum path , one can define the center - of - gravity ( centroid ) as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the position of bead @xmath22 in the associated ring polymer .",
    "then , the mean - square displacement @xmath23 of the atomic nuclei ( h or o in our case ) along a pimd simulation run is defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 indicates an ensemble average .    in connection with the quantum delocalization of a particle ,",
    "a quantity related with its kinetic energy is the spread of the paths associated to it , which can be measured by the mean - square `` radius - of - gyration '' @xmath26 of the ring polymers : @xmath27 a smaller @xmath26 ( higher particle localization ) is associated with a higher kinetic energy , in accordance with heisenberg s uncertainty principle @xcite",
    ".      we will compare below results of the pimd simulations with those yielded by a quasi - harmonic approximation ( qha ) , carried out by using the same q - tip4p / f interatomic potential .",
    "this procedure has been introduced earlier in @xcite and @xcite , and we will only present here a brief summary of it .",
    "the helmholtz free energy of a solid phase with @xmath13 water molecules in a cell of volume @xmath28 and at temperature @xmath1 is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the static zero - temperature classical energy , i.e. , the minimum of the potential energy for volume @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath31 is the vibrational contribution to the free energy , which in a quantum approach is given by @xmath32 \\right )   \\ ; , \\label{fvv}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 are the frequencies of the harmonic lattice vibrations for volume @xmath28 , with @xmath22 including the phonon branch index and the wave vector within the brillouin zone .",
    "the anharmonicity of the interatomic potential enters in the qha only through the volume dependence of @xmath33 . in the classical limit",
    "the vibrational contribution amounts to @xmath34    @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ fvt ] ) is the configurational entropy due to h disorder , and is relevant when comparing different ice phases , in particular h - ordered and h - disordered ones . in our case , it can be taken as the pauling entropy @xcite or that given by some more elaborate calculations @xcite , but its actual value does not affect the results discussed here .    to obtain the gibbs free energy , @xmath36 , one finds the volume @xmath37 that minimizes the function @xmath38 .",
    "then , @xmath36 is obtained as @xmath39 more details on the implementation of this qha to study structural and thermodynamic properties of ice phases can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we first present results for the equilibrium volume of ice vii , as derived from our pimd simulations . in fig .  1 we show the temperature dependence of the molar volume at a pressure @xmath0 = 6 gpa , in the temperature range where the solid was found to be stable or metastable in the simulations ( up to @xmath2 330 k )",
    ". results of the quantum simulations are given as solid squares .",
    "for comparison , we also present data points derived from classical md simulations ( solid circles ) , as well as results of classical and quantum qhas ( solid lines ) . looking at the results of the simulations , one observes the lattice expansion due to quantum nuclear motion , which is most appreciable at low temperatures . at 25 k , we find @xmath28 = 10.305 @xmath40/mol in the classical approach vs 10.537 @xmath40/mol in the quantum simulations .",
    "this means a low - temperature lattice expansion of 0.232 @xmath40/mol , i.e. , an increase of 2.3% with respect to the classical estimate .",
    "this relative lattice expansion is somewhat smaller than that found for ice ih at low temperatures and ambient pressure ( @xmath41 4% ) , in agreement with the fact that it is expected to decrease as pressure is raised @xcite .    for ice vii at @xmath0 = 6 gpa ,",
    "the quantum qha gives values of the molar volume smaller than the pimd simulations by about 0.02 @xmath40/mol ( a difference of about 0.2% ) , and this difference increases slowly as the temperature is raised . in the classical approach ,",
    "both methods yield similar results at low temperatures , and the difference between them also increases for rising @xmath1 as in the quantum case , since anharmonicity becomes more relevant .    an interesting aspect of fig .  1 is the absence of a negative thermal expansion in the whole temperature range , contrary to what happens for low - pressure phases such as hexagonal ice ih , and observed in pimd simulations @xcite as well as in diffraction experiments @xcite .",
    "this negative expansion has been interpreted as being due to the tetrahedral coordination of water molecules in ice ih , along with the large cavities ( vacant space ) present in its structure .",
    "although the h - bond network in ice vii has also a tetrahedral structure , such cavities are not present in it because of the existence of two subnetworks filling the empty space , with the associated increase in density .    in a recent study of the phase diagram of ice using the q - tip4p / f potential , it was found that ice vii is the stable phase only for pressures larger than 6 gpa and @xmath42 70 k @xcite .",
    "thus , our results for @xmath3 6 gpa correspond to metastable ice vii . in this pressure region",
    ", it is known that for a given value of @xmath0 , ice vii becomes unstable at a certain temperature that rises with @xmath0 , and the crystalline solid melts giving rise to an amorphous phase @xcite",
    ". this behavior has been reproduced by our pimd simulations . in fig .  2 we present the molar volume of ice vii as a function of temperature at five different pressures .",
    "the three upper curves correspond to metastable ice vii , and their metastability limit is observed for each pressure as a jump in the volume . at 1 gpa ,",
    "this jump occurs at about 150 k , and evolves to higher temperatures as the pressure is raised .",
    "the two lower curves ( for 6 and 9 gpa ) correspond to the pressure region where ice vii is the stable phase @xcite , and a jump in the molar volume is observed at @xmath2 350 and 400 k , respectively .    even though our main interest here is focused on ice vii",
    ", it is worth commenting about the phases we observed in pimd simulations when ice vii became unstable by increasing the temperature . according to the obtained radial distribution functions ( rdfs ) , for @xmath3 6 gpa we found an amorphous phase similar to those described earlier by slovk and tanaka @xcite from classical molecular dynamics simulations using tip4p and spc / e potentials .",
    "these authors explored the possibility of generating model structures of low - density amorphous ice by computationally heating ice vii . for @xmath0 = 6 and 9",
    "gpa , we found an ice structure , which according to the rdf is compatible with the plastic crystal phase detected earlier in various computational studies of ice in this pressure region , using different interatomic potentials @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that the rdf obtained here from pimd simulations using the q - tip4p / f potential is very similar to that reported earlier for the body - centered cubic plastic crystal @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , it is worthwhile comparing results of pimd simulations for a cubic high - pressure phase of water with those derived for a cubic low - pressure phase such as ice ic .",
    "thus , the temperature dependence of cubic ice ic is shown in fig .  3 for several pressures .",
    "again , symbols represent results of pimd simulations , and solid lines were obtained in a quantum qha . at ambient pressure ( @xmath0 = 1 bar ) , the molar volume displays a minimum at about 120 k , similarly to that reported earlier for pimd simulations of hexagonal ice ih at this pressure @xcite .",
    "in fact , the results for the molar volume of ih and ic ices derived from the simulations coincide within error bars . for increasing pressure",
    ", one observes that the minimum of the volume shifts towards higher temperatures , and eventually disappears when this ice phase becomes unstable .",
    "results of the qha present qualitatively the same trend for the molar volume of ice ic as the pimd data , but the former overestimates the negative thermal expansion .",
    "this is a case where the pimd and qha results are appreciably different , as a consequence of the instability appearing in ice ic ( as in ice ih ) , which causes the collapse of the crystal structure at a pressure of about 1 gpa @xcite .    the negative thermal expansion of ice ic shown in fig .",
    "3 is due to the negative grneisen parameter @xmath43 of low - energy transverse acoustic ( ta ) modes , related to librational motion of water molecules . for a vibrational mode with frequency @xmath33 , the parameter @xmath43 is defined as the logarithmic derivative of @xmath43 with respect to the crystal volume @xcite : @xmath44 at relatively low temperature , low - energy modes are more populated than modes with higher energy ( with positive @xmath43 ) , and then the overall contribution to the volume change with increasing temperature will be negative @xcite . in this context , the larger negative thermal expansion of ice ic derived from the qha , with respect to the results of pimd , is due to an overestimation of the negative value of @xmath43 for ta modes in the qha .",
    "such overestimation increases for rising pressure , as shown in fig .  3 .",
    "turning now to the high - pressure phase , in fig .",
    "4 we show the pressure dependence of the molar volume of ice vii , as obtained from simulations with the q - tip4p / f potential .",
    "symbols indicate simulation results , whereas lines were derived from qhas , both classical and quantum .",
    "two temperatures are shown : 50 k and 300 k. at 50 k , both classical and quantum data are given , and at 300 k only the quantum results are shown ( the classical ones lie slightly below the quantum data , and are not displayed to avoid overcrowding of the figure ) .    the quasi - harmonic approximation gives a good description of the equation of state @xmath45 of ice vii in both cases , quantum and classical . at 300 k ,",
    "the pimd simulations yield volumes slightly higher than the qha , but the difference between both methods decreases as the pressure is raised .",
    "this is in line with earlier observations that the qha becomes more accurate to describe structural properties of solids under high pressures @xcite .",
    "this is related to the pressure ( or volume ) dependence of the vibrational @xmath46 and elastic @xmath47 contributions to the free energy in eq .",
    "( [ fvt ] ) . for high pressures ( small volumes ) ,",
    "the internal energy is dominated by the elastic contribution @xmath47 , which becomes much larger than the vibrational energy , and hence the influence of lattice vibrations ( and of their anharmonicity ) on thermodynamic properties comparatively decreases @xcite .",
    "this means that the anharmonicity of the vibrational modes not captured by the qha becomes less relevant for high pressures . on the contrary , we emphasize that the relative error of the qha ( compared with pimd simulations ) increases as temperature is raised , as expected for an increased anharmonicity due to thermal effects and shown in fig .  1 . this difference between qha and pimd usually increases slowly for rising @xmath1 , unless some particular anomaly appears for the vibrational frequencies , as happens close to the stability limit of a solid phase ( see fig .  3 for ice ic , which becomes unstable for @xmath6 1  gpa ) .",
    "in such a case , the qha also becomes less accurate for increasing @xmath0 , contrary to the general trend discussed above .",
    "one also observes in fig .  4 that the difference between quantum and classical results at 50 k decreases as @xmath0 rises .",
    "this difference amounts to 0.42 @xmath40/mol for @xmath0 = 1 bar vs 0.15 @xmath40/mol for @xmath0 = 12 gpa , i.e. , the quantum - induced volume expansion decreases from a 3.5% to a 1.6% in this pressure range .",
    "this is in line with the fact that the classical model become more and more accurate to describe structural and thermodynamic properties of solids at high pressures .",
    "this could seem at first sight contradictory with the fact that pressure induces a larger zero - point vibrational energy of the solid , of purely quantum nature , because of the overall increase of vibrational frequencies with rising pressure .",
    "however , the relevant factor here is again ( as for the qha ) the ratio of the vibrational energy to the whole internal energy of the solid . since in this respect",
    "the lattice vibrations become less relevant as pressure rises , and eventually give a relatively small contribution to the free energy of the solid , their actual description by a classical or a quantum model becomes less important for solids under large pressures @xcite .",
    "this is not necessarily true for spectroscopic properties of solids , since vibrational frequencies predicted by a qha or by a classical model are not guaranteed to describe correctly the actual ones for high pressure .",
    "moreover , the above considerations on structural and thermodynamic properties apply to isolated phases such as ice vii here , but dynamical quantum effects can be crucial to describe phase transitions between different ice phases , as happens for h - bond symmetrization in the transition from ice vii to ice x @xcite .    an interesting question related to our simulations of h - disordered ice vii refers to the dispersion in calculated volumes for different realizations of h disorder on the simulation supercell . as indicated in sec .",
    "ii.a , we have considered six realizations for the h distribution according to the ice rules , and differences between the resulting volumes were less than the symbol sizes in figs .  2 and 4 .",
    "thus , at 50 k our pimd simulations yielded volume differences in the order of @xmath48 @xmath40/mol .",
    "we note that this value is much smaller than the volume difference between ice vii and its h - ordered counterpart ice viii , for which we found from pimd simulations a molar volume of 12.333 @xmath40/mol at 1 bar and 50 k , i.e. , 0.041 @xmath40/mol less than that found for ice vii a the same conditions .",
    "most measurements of the @xmath45 curve for ice vii have been performed at or close to room temperature . in fig .",
    "5 we display the results of our pimd simulations for the molar volume at 300 k , along with data derived by several authors from x - ray diffraction experiments . at this temperature ,",
    "ice vii turns out to be unstable in pimd simulations with the q - tip4p / f potential at pressures @xmath49 4  gpa , so that 4.5 gpa is the lowest pressure plotted in this figure for the simulation data .",
    "although there is some dispersion in the diffraction data , the molar volumes obtained from experiment are smaller than those predicted by the simulations .",
    "the difference between calculated and actual volumes decreases as pressure is reduced , and both seem to converge at low pressures .",
    "this could be expected from the good agreement obtained for low - pressure phases ( ices ih , ii , and iii ) , between measured molar volumes and those derived from pimd simulations with the q - tip4p / f potential model @xcite .    at 4.5 gpa",
    "the simulations overestimate the molar volume of ice vii by about a 4% , and this difference increases as pressure grows , reaching a 6% at 12 gpa .",
    "we have investigated the origin of this drawback of the q - tip4p / f potential model at high pressures , and found that the solid becomes `` stiff '' mainly due to the lennard - jones - type contribution to the interaction between adjacent molecules in different subnetworks . to check this ,",
    "we have carried out some pimd simulations with a modified q - tip4p / f potential where this contribution was rescaled by a factor less than one , so that the repulsion between water molecules in both subnetworks was reduced .",
    "the dashed line in fig .  5 corresponds to a simulation with such a factor taken to be 0.6 , which means that the lennard - jones interaction between different h - bond subnetworks was reduced by a 40% .",
    "with such a correction in the interatomic potential , the simulation results are much closer to those derived from diffraction data , especially at pressures higher than 6 gpa .",
    "this shows a limitation of this kind of interatomic potentials for studying water phases at very high pressures .",
    "an _ ad hoc _ modification of the potential may improve the description of some features of these phases , but it is not clear that it can give a good overall description of their structural and thermodynamic properties .",
    "a similar conclusion was drawn by aragones _",

    "o distance is larger in ice vii than in ice ic , because the diamond - like structure of ice ic contains large void regions , which are occupied by water molecules in ice vii .",
    "we found in the pimd simulations with the above conditions : @xmath65(o  o ) = 2.99   for ice vii vs 2.76   for ice ic .",

    "7 that the change of o ",
    "h distance with pressure is clearly larger for ice ic , in accordance with a larger compressibility of this low - pressure phase .",

    "h stretching modes to @xmath70(h ) is larger in ice vii ( stronger covalent bonds , with larger zero - point energy ) , but it is largely compensated for by the contribution of librational modes ( weaker h - bonds in ice vii ) .",

    "@xmath70(h ) was found to decrease in a large range of pressures , in particular in the region between 5 and 12 gpa , which overlaps with our calculations .",
    "the main reason for this decrease is the softening of the o ",
    "h stretching modes for rising pressure .",
    "these calculations involved five representative frequencies for the various vibrational modes present in ice vii ( translation , libration , bending , symmetric and asymmetric stretching ) , and not the whole vibrational density of states of the solid , but one expects that the main features of the vibrational energy should be captured by such a model .",
    "this behavior of @xmath70(h ) is associated to the decrease of stretching frequencies as pressure is raised , discussed above in connection with the pressure - dependence of the molar volume .",

    "10 we display the dependence of @xmath70(h ) on pressure , as given by the qha at @xmath1 = 50 k. the solid line with a label `` @xmath79 '' coincides with the curve shown in fig .  9 for this temperature .",

    "( [ deltaom ] ) by scaling @xmath43 with the factors indicated by the labels ( @xmath78 = 1.3 , 1.6 , 1.9 , ad 2.2 ) .",

    "this indicates the crucial role of stretching modes for the pressure dependence of the vibrational energy . a large contribution of these vibrational modes to the kinetic energy",
    "could be expected from their high frequency , as compared to the other modes in this solid .",
    "the pressure - dependence of @xmath70(h ) is however largely controlled by the parameters @xmath43 , which turn out to be negative for the stretching modes in condensed phases of water .",

    "@xmath26 represents a 71% of @xmath23 for hydrogen and a 37% for oxygen , since the quantum contribution to the atomic delocalization is more important for hydrogen .",

    "this high-@xmath1 limit , however , can not be approached for ice vii due to the onset of melting .",
    "one can estimate a mean extension of the quantum paths of hydrogen from @xmath26 . at 50 k and 1 bar",

    "our results indicate that the validity of the qha to describe structural and thermodynamic properties of this water phase increases as pressure is raised .",
    "this is mainly a consequence of the relative importance of elastic and vibrational energy , with the former becoming increasingly dominant as pressure increases .",
    "consequently , the precision requirements for a good description of anharmonic vibrational modes is reduced with rising pressure .",
    "it has been also argued that structural properties of solids under pressure can be described rather accurately by a classical model for the lattice vibrations .",
    "the reason for this is similar to the decreasing of anharmonicity as pressure rises , because in this respect the actual description of the lattice vibrations by a classical or a quantum model becomes less important for solids under high pressures .",
    "this is questionable for spectroscopic features of high - pressure phases when a certain accuracy is required , since vibrational frequencies predicted by a classical model or a qha are not guaranteed to describe precisely the actual ones for high pressure .",
    "all this applies to structural properties of an isolated ice phase , but quantum motion of protons has been found to be relevant for high - pressure transitions between ice phases , as in the h - bond symmetrization taking place in the transition from ice vii to ice x.    we finally note that this kind of atomistic simulations of high - pressure phases of water could be improved by the design of interatomic potentials describing accurately their @xmath45 equation of state .",
    "this may probably be achieved by adapting present - day potential models , modifying the short - range intermolecular interactions to allow for a larger compressibility at high pressures ."
