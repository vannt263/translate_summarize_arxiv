    "blazars are a subset of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , which are compact , flat spectrum radio sources with highly variable and polarized nonthermal continuum emission ranging from radio up to x - ray and often to @xmath0-ray frequency ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "their observed properties are mainly considered to originate from a relativistic beaming jet @xcite , which is possibly powered and accelerated by a rotating and accreting supermassive black hole .",
    "there are two classes of blazars , bl lac objects ( bl lacs ) and fsrqs , the former one has a featureless optical continuum , while the latter has a great many strong and broad emission lines .",
    "according to the peak frequency of synchrotron emission relative to the peak flux , bl lacs are classified as lbls , whose peak is located in infrared or optical band , and hbls , whose peak is located in the ultraviolet or x - ray frequency @xcite . for hbls , the broadband spectral index @xmath1 is less than or equal to 0.75 @xcite or 0.80 @xcite , while for lbls , it is greater than 0.75 or 0.80 .",
    "the studies of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars are very important for the understanding of the physical radiation mechanism and to constrain the parameters involved in physical model , and the studies are crucial in analyzing individual emission components .",
    "synchrotron inverse compton emission model predicts that the spectrum gets harder as the source turns brighter .",
    "many investigators found that the variation amplitude of blazars at high frequencies was larger than that at low frequencies , namely , the spectrum became flatter when the flux increased , while the spectrum became steeper when the flux decreased ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "but @xcite suggested that it might not be always correct ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite reported the optical spectral slope variability of 8 bl lacs .",
    "they found that the spectral slope became flatter when the source turned brighter for all 8 objects .",
    "four objects showed marked correlation between spectral slopes and _ r _ magnitudes .",
    "@xcite analyzed the spectral slope variability of 42 pg quasars .",
    "they concluded that the spectral variability must be intrinsic of the nuclear component .",
    "their numerical simulation showed that hot spots on the disk were able to represent the observed spectral variability , while single host galaxy contribution or single changes of accretion rate was insufficient to explain the slope variability .",
    "@xcite analyzed the data from @xcite under a simple synchrotron mode and the thermal bump ( tb ) mode .",
    "they showed that the spectral variability , even restricted to the optical band , could be used to set limits on the relative contribution of the synchrotron component and the thermal component .",
    "they deduced that the spectral variability of bl lacs differed from the variability of quasars .",
    "the 8 bl lacs they studied were all lbls .",
    "@xcite presented that the spectrum of a fsrq pks 0736 + 017 became softer when it turned brighter .",
    "the correlation between spectral slope and flux was strong .",
    "its variability relation between slope and flux was reverse to the result that was mentioned above for lbls .    in this paper",
    "we show and discuss the optical spectral slope variability of 17 blazars , which include 9 lbls , 4 hbls and 4 fsrqs . in section 2",
    "we describe the data and data reduction process .",
    "the average optical spectral slope distribution is analyzed in section 3 , the spectral slope variability is given in section 4 , and conclusions are presented in the last section .",
    "we collected optical observations from the published papers in period of @xmath2 , which were made in the standard johnson - cousins _ b _ , _ v _ , _ r _ , _ i _ bands .",
    "the observations should be simultaneous in all above - mentioned optical bands in order to get the optical spectral slope , but it is difficult due to telescopes and instruments .",
    "@xcite reported that the minimum variability timescales of 21 blazars were longer than 1 hour , and most of them were longer than 2 or 3 hours .",
    "we regard this quasi  simultaneous multi - band observations taken within 1 hour as  simultaneous \" observations ( @xcite and @xcite accepted quasi - simultaneous observations taken within 2 hours ) .",
    "so we merely selected the quasi - simultaneous observations , which were made in three(any three bands of _ b _ , _ v _ , _ r _ and _ i _ ) or four bands(_b _ , _ v _ , _ r _ , _ i _ ) within 1 hour , as the raw data for accuracy .",
    "we selected a group of quasi - simultaneous observations in three or four bands as one data group , and most of the data groups were made within 30 minutes .",
    "then the following reduction processes were applied to all the selected raw data .",
    "all the observation data made in _",
    "v _ band were corrected for the foreground galactic interstellar reddening and absorption with the employment of the extinction value @xmath3 , which is deduced from the maps of dust infrared emission reported by @xcite .",
    "the extinction values in other bands were obtained by using the curve of @xcite .",
    "the reddening and absorption correction can be done by subtracting the corresponding extinction value from the raw data .",
    "the conversion from apparent magnitudes to optical flux densities was made by using the zero magnitude equivalent flux density given by @xcite .",
    "the rest frequencies were obtained through the effective wavelengths of the filters given by @xcite and the redshift given by @xcite .",
    "the radiation of blazars can be described by a single power law @xmath4 in optical band , where @xmath5 is the spectral slope .",
    "it was obtained by using the linear least square fitting between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we can obtain one @xmath5 from each data group , but we accepted only the spectral slope whose square of pearson s linear correlation coefficient is greater than 0.9 and whose standard deviation of fitting slope is less than 0.4 ( the typical standard deviation of the spectral slope is less than 0.1 ) .",
    "the aforesaid selection criterions assure the accuracy of the slopes by cutting off the probably wrong values due to quasi - simultaneous @xcite .",
    "after all the above reduction , we accepted 1418 useful data groups from all the raw data groups for 17 blazar samples whose data were sufficient to investigate the spectral slope variability .",

    "many investigators studied such connections @xcite , which would play an important role in constraining the radiation mechanism of blazars and understanding the fundamental nature of blazars .",
    "@xcite showed that blazars form a sequence , the sed changed continuously with the change of their bolometric luminosity .",
    "the synchrotron component and inverse compton component of hbls approximately had the same scale of energy and showed two emission peaks , which shifted to lower frequencies as the bolometric luminosity increases .",
    "subclasses from fsrqs through lbls to hbls exhibited a sequence of increasing spectral hardness with the decreasing of luminosity @xcite .",
    "it suggests that this may be a sequence of decreasing accretion rate along the same sequence , so they proposed an evolutionary scenario linking fsrqs , lbls and hbls through the gradual depletion of the circumnuclear environment of a supermassive black hole .",

    ", we expect @xmath15 for lbls and fsrqs due to their sed in the descending part , but we expect @xmath16 for hbls because of their sed in the ascending part .",
    "the model of @xcite predicted that for a broad range of particle injection distribution , synchrotron self compton ( ssc)-loss - dominated synchrotron emission exhibited a spectrum whose spectral slope was 1.5 in optical band .",

    "the spectra generally become steep when they turn bright ( e.g. @xcite ) except for 3c 279 , but all four correlations are not significant at a 0.95 confidence level .",
    "it is interesting that the tendency is possibly opposite in the faint state against the bright state for 1156 + 295 .",
    "the general result can be interpreted by the thermal bump model by @xcite , they predicted that a strong thermal bump could produce a spectrum that becomes steep when getting bright , where the thermal bump emerges in the faint state .",
    "the variability of 1156 + 295 is a good support to @xcite , they mentioned that in high brightness state the spectra variability of fsrqs showed similar properties with that of bl lacs .",
    "but in the faint state , since the thermal contribution was larger in the blue part , the nonthermal component was steeper than the composite spectrum .",
    "the nonthermal component had an even more dominant contribution to the total flux when the object got bright , and the composite spectrum got steeper @xcite .",

    "<S> many quasi - simultaneous optical observations of 17 blazars were obtained from the previous published papers over last 19 years in order to investigate the spectral slope variability and understand the radiation mechanism of blazars . the long period dereddened optical spectral slopes were calculated in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis upon the average spectral slope distribution suggests that the spectra of flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and high energy peaked bl lac objects ( hbls ) are probably deformed by other emission components . </S>",
    "<S> the average spectral slopes of low energy peaked bl lac objects(lbls ) , which scatter around 1.5 , show a good accordance with synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) loss - dominated model . </S>",
    "<S> we present and discuss the variability between spectral slope and optical luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra of all hbls and lbls get flatter when they turn brighter , while for fsrqs this trend does not exist or may be in a reverse situation . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon may imply that there is a thermal contribution to the optical spectrum for fsrqs . </S>",
    "<S> for the fsrq 1156 + 295 , there is a hint that the slope gets flatter at both the brightest and faintest states . </S>",
    "<S> our result shows that three subclasses locate in different regions in the pattern of slope variability indicator versus the average spectral slope . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we also delineate that relativistic jet mechanism is supported by the significant correlation between the optical doppler factor and the average spectral slope .
