    "in the sunspot umbra , the overturning motion of the plasma is hindered by the strong magnetic field , thus leading to a lower temperature in the photosphere due to the reduced energy input ( gough & tayler 1966 ) . within the umbra , light bridges ( lbs )",

    "( _ iris _ ; de pontieu et al . 2014 ) was operated to observe the ar with a field - of - view ( fov ) of 119@xmath2119 and obtained quite a lot of excellent data . especially , a period of about 1 hr around 06:00 ut on october 25 was spent observing the light bridge dynamics as designed , and a series of high tempo - spatial images were obtained . in the present study , we report the discovery of oscillating light wall above a light bridge in ar 12192 , using the jointed observations from the _ iris _ , the _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( _ sdo _ ; pesnell et al .",
    "2012 ) , and the new vacuum solar telescope ( nvst ; liu et al .",

    "1983 ) .",
    "moreover , we also use the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ; scherrer et al .",

    "the overview of ar 12192 on october 25 is displayed in figure 1(a ) .",
    "the polarities of the leading and following sunspots are positive and negative , respectively . in the following sunspot , there is a weak magnetic field channel in the strong fields ( outlined by the white square ) .",
    "the fov outlined by the white square in panel ( a ) is partially covered by nvst tio observations . the tio image ( panel ( b ) ) which is rotated 135",
    "anticlockwise shows the fine structures of the umbra and penumbra .",
    "there is a distinct strong light bridge ( denoted by the arrow ) crossing the umbra .",
    "the width of the photospheric light bridge distinguished in the tio image is about 3 ( 2.2 mm ) . the corresponding _ iris _ 1330  image",
    "is displayed in panel ( c ) . in the 1330  image , many bright structures are rooted in the light bridge , forming a light wall ( denoted by the arrow ) . to view the light wall well , the expanded image outlined by the rectangle is shown in panel ( d ) .",
    "the light wall is brighter compared with the surrounding areas .",
    "especially , the top and base ( indicated by the arrows ) of the wall are brighter than the wall body .",
    "we use the multi - wavelength observations to study the properties of the light wall in detail .",
    "the nvst h@xmath0 , sji 1330  , aia 171  , and 131  images around 05:50 ut on october 25 are shown in figures 2(a)-(d ) , respectively , and the fov is outlined by the square in figure 1(d ) . in the 1330  image in figure 2(b ) , there is a bubble - like structure ( delineated by the black curve ) between the top ( upper bright structure ) and base ( lower bright structure ) of the light wall .",
    "we can see that the bubble also corresponds to a dark region in h@xmath0 ( panel ( a ) ) , 171  ( panel ( c ) ) , and 131  ( panel ( d ) ) images .",
    "the top of the light wall appears as a bright structure in 171  and 131  images , while it could not be identified in the h@xmath0 image . on the contrary",
    ", the base of the light wall appears as a bright structure in h@xmath0 and 1330  , which can not be found in 171  and 131  images .",
    "we make the multi - wavelength cuts along slice  a - b \" ( see the white line in figure 2(b ) ) and present them in figure 2(e ) . the deep , light , and deep pink shadows from left to right mark the locations of the base , body , and top of the light wall , respectively . in the h@xmath0 cut ( the green curve )",
    ", the high emission corresponds to the wall base location . the further the location away from the base is , the lower the h@xmath0 emission is . in the 1330  cut ( the dark curve ) , there are two peaks .",
    "the larger one ( marked with the cross symbol ) corresponds to the top of the light wall , and the smaller peak corresponds to the wall base .",
    "the emission of the wall body is lower than those of the wall top and base , however , it is higher than that of the nearby area ( see the dashed line ) . in the 171  cut ( the red curve ) , the high emission is at the wall top location , and the emissions at the foot and body locations are quite low .      figures 3(a1)-(a5 ) display the evolution of the light wall which is outlined by the rectangle in figure 2(b ) .",
    "we can see that the wall top rose first and then fell down . from 05:49:04 ut to 05:51:52 ut , the projected height of the wall increased by 0.8 mm in about 3 min .",
    "then it decreased by 0.4 mm in the following 1.5 min . along slice ",
    "c - d \" marked in figure 3(a5 ) , we make a space - time plot , which is displayed in panel ( b ) .",
    "the most conspicuous behavior revealed by the plot is that there exists continuous oscillations of the bright top of the light wall .",
    "the solid blue curve outlines the position evolution of the wall top , and the dashed line marks the base of the light wall .",
    "the distance between the wall base and the wall top is calculated as the height of the light wall .",
    "it should be noted that , in order to reduce the effect of the wall width on the wall height , the wall height _ h _ is measured from the base center to the top center .",
    "the mean projected wall height is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the projected height in frame _ i_. the mean projected amplitude of oscillations is @xmath6 , and the mean projected oscillation velocity is latexmath:[$\\overline{v}= \\frac{\\sum_{0}^{n-1 } | \\delta h_{j}/\\delta t_{j }    are the height difference and time difference between the neighboring peak and valley , respectively .",
    "the heliocentric angle ( @xmath0 ) of the light wall is 26 .",
    "when considering the projection effect , the corrected mean height of the wall is @xmath8 mm , the mean amplitude is @xmath9 mm , and the mean oscillation velocity is @xmath10 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we apply the morlet wavelet method to the heights of the light wall , and show the wavelet power spectrum in panel ( c ) .",
    "it clearly reveals that there is a main oscillation period around 4 min .",
    "the global power ( see panel ( d ) ) shows that the main period is 3.9 min .    on 2014",
    "october 29 , ar 12192 moved to a location close to the west limb ( figure 4(a ) ) .",
    "the light wall oscillated continually , and some part of the wall top performed an interesting behavior , i.e. , the wall top was brighter in the upward motion phase than in the downward phase . to describe this kind of performance well , a section of the light wall ( outlined by the rectangle in panel ( a ) ) is focused on .",
    "a series of sub - region images are displayed in panels ( b1)-(b5 ) . at 16:34:02 ut",
    ", the top of the wall appeared as a bright structure , as labeled between the parallel lines in panel ( b1 ) .",
    "one minute later , the bright structure moved upward to a higher position and became much brighter ( see panel ( b2 ) ) .",
    "the bright structure then reached to the highest position , and its emission became weaker ( see panel ( b3 ) ) .",
    "after that , the wall top moved downward with a weak emission ( panels ( b4)-(b5 ) ) .    to further study the evolution of the light wall , we make a space - time plot along slice ",
    "e - f \" marked in figure 4(b2 ) , and present it in figure 5(a ) .",
    "the blue curve in figure 5(a ) outlines the evolution of the wall top .",
    "the wall top performed oscillations with the average period of about 4.5 min .",
    "the red asterisks mark the locations of the maxima and the minima of four periods .",
    "the vertical dashed lines separate the different periods .",
    "the heliocentric angle of the light wall is 78 .",
    "then the deprojected mean height of the wall is about 3.8 mm , the mean amplitude is 1.0 mm , and the mean oscillation velocity is 14.4 km s@xmath1 .",
    "these values are consistent with those obtained using the october 25 series .",
    "especially , the deprojected wall heights obtained at different times are comparable , implying that the wall width does not significantly affect the height measurement of the light wall .",
    "it seems that , for each period , the emission of the wall top in the upward motion stage is higher than in the downward motion stage . to quantitatively study this property , the brightness of the wall top",
    "is plotted with the blue curve in panel ( b ) .",
    "in addition , the green curve in panel ( b ) is the brightness of the wall body ( along the green line in panel ( a ) ) .",
    "the mean brightness of the wall body is about 4 @xmath11 , where @xmath11 is the umbra brightness in 1330  .",
    "we can see that the brightness of the wall top is higher than the wall body all the time .",
    "the mean brightness of the wall top is about 12 @xmath11 and that of the wall body is about 4 @xmath11 .",
    "the mean brightness values in the four downward motion stages ( gray shadow regions ) are 9.3 @xmath11 , 8.1 @xmath11 , 5.9 @xmath11 , and 6.0 @xmath11 , smaller than those ( 16.5 @xmath11 , 21.1 @xmath11 , 11.2 @xmath11 , and 10.5 @xmath11 ) in the upward stages ( white regions ) , respectively .",
    "with the high tempo - spatial _ iris _ 1330  observations , we find an ensemble of oscillating bright features in the chromosphere and transition region above a light bridge , and name this ensemble with a new term _",
    "light wall_. the light wall is brighter than the surrounding regions , and the top and base of the light wall are much brighter than the wall body . in addition , we use the nvst and aia multi - wavelength data to study the properties of the light wall .",
    "we find that the wall top appeared as a similar bright structure in 1330  , 171  , and 131  images while it can not be identified in the h@xmath0 line .",
    "the wall body appeared as a bright structure in 1330  and as a dark structure in the other lines .",
    "the wall top moved upward and downward successively , performing continuous oscillations .",
    "the deprojected average height , amplitude , and oscillation velocity are about 3.6 mm , 0.9 mm , and 15.4 km s@xmath1 , respectively . by applying the wavelet analysis method to the heights of the light wall",
    ", we find that the main oscillation period is 3.9 min . in another series of _ iris _ 1330  images",
    ", we find that the wall top in the upward motion phase was brighter than in the downward phase .    the previous studies ( sobotka et al .",
    "2013 ; yuan et al .",
    "2014b ) about lb oscillations were done through examining the intensity variations or the doppler characters in lbs . in the present paper",
    ", we find a dynamical light wall rooted in the lb , and have directly observed the light wall oscillations in height for the first time . the dominant period of the light wall oscillations is 3.9 min , comparable with that ( 4.2 min ) determined by sobotka et al .",
    "we interpret the oscillations of the light wall as the leakage of _",
    "p_-modes from below the photosphere .",
    "the _ p_-modes are global resonant acoustic oscillations appearing as photospheric velocity and intensity pulsations .",
    "the _ p_-modes can leak enough energy to drive upward flows ( de pontieu et al .",
    "2004 ) , resulting in the oscillations of the light wall .",
    "over the light bridge in noaa ar 10132 , berger & berdyugina ( 2003 ) observed persistent brightness enhancement in the 1600  images from the _ transition region and coronal explorer _ ( _ trace _ ) satellite .",
    "they interpreted the enhanced lb brightness in 1600  as magnetic heating through some kind of magnetic reconnection which is still unclear . according to klimchuk ( 2006 ) ,",
    "oscillations can carry acoustic flux , a significant energy flux , to higher atmosphere to heat the solar atmosphere .",
    "moreover , in a study of the lb in noaa 11005 , sobotka et al .",
    "( 2013 ) measured the acoustic power flux leaking along the magnetic fields in the lb from the photosphere to the chromosphere , and found that the transferred energy flux is sufficient to balance the total radiative losses of the lb in the chromosphere .",
    "in the present study , for the light wall on october 25 , the wall top appeared as a constant enhancement in brightness , which can be observed in 1330  , 171  , and 131  lines , implying that there exists some kind of atmospheric heating . however , it is difficult to know which one is the exact mechanism for the wall top heating : the persistent small - scale reconnection or the magneto - acoustic waves . for the light wall on october 29 ,",
    "the wall top was significantly brighter in the upward motion stage than in the downward phase , implying that there was an intermittent heating during each oscillation period .",
    "we suggest that this kind of dynamical behavior may be powered by the energy released due to intermittent impulsive magnetic reconnection ."
