    "in the recent review on the @xmath2 meson physics @xcite , one analyzed possibilities of a practical observation of the long - living pseudoscalar @xmath3-state in the flavoured heavy quarkonium @xmath4 at running facilities .",
    "one shown , that at present integral luminocities of the lep and fnal experiments , the expected number of completely reconstructed events with the weak decays of @xmath2 is of the order of one or two dozens , where the specific place is taken by the @xmath2 decay modes with the @xmath5 particle in the final state , since the latter can be observed with a high efficiency in the leptonic mode of @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast to the manyparticle or semileptonic modes of decay , the @xmath0 transition with @xmath6 is outstanding , because one can completely reconstruct the @xmath2 decay vertex over the tracks by the charged particles and one can measure the @xmath2 mass .",
    "therefore , the value of branching ratio for the @xmath0 decay is considered to be quite significant for the practical search of @xmath2 .    at present ,",
    "estimates of the @xmath0 decay width have been done in the framework of nonrelativistic potential models for constituent quarks @xcite with account for hard gluon corrections to the weak transition currents as @xmath7 .",
    "the different models give the branching ratio value , close to @xmath8 however , the application of such potential models is assumed to have the maximum accuracy at low momenta of the recoil meson ( @xmath5 in the decay under consideration ) , since the transition form factors are determined by integrals of overlapping between wave functions of the decaying meson and the recoil one over the momentum region , which is the most accurately determined at low recoils , when maxima of the wave functions overlapp , and these maxima are the most certainly calculated in the nonrelativistic approach . at large recoil momenta , it is necessary to calculate the overlapping between the maximum of the first function and the rapidly decreasing tail of the second wave function , so that the procedure leads to a large numerical uncertainty , having a principial sense .",
    "indeed , in the framework of the nonrelativistic approximation , the meson is considered as a narrow wave packedge of free quarks with a low binding energy .",
    "therefore , this description is applicable only at low relative momenta between the constituent quarks , and the model is selfconsistent only under the condition , that the wave functions , obtained in such way , give a suppression of large relative momenta . for",
    "the description of the latters , the nonrelativistic potential models do not claim , since a contribution of this region , say , into the schrdinger equation is suppressed by the sense of the potential model construction .",
    "one usually supposes , that a momentum , being of the order of the constituent quark mass , is the low boundary of large relative momenta .",
    "as one can easily show in the @xmath0 decay , the situation takes place , when the application of the wave function overlapping formalism is not excusive and it can serve for the exptrapolation estimates in the order of magnitude width must be made to a lower value . ] . in this case",
    ", one has to consider the quark - meson form factor in the region , where one of the quarks , entering the meson , has a large virtuality .",
    "hence , this region can not be described in the framework of nonrelativistic form factors , where , by construction , both constituent quarks are in vicinity of the mass shells .",
    "however , the heavy quark virtualities , comparable with its mass , correspond to the field of applicability of the qcd perturbation theory . therefore",
    ", one can consider a hard gluon emission by the low virtuality quark , that can be described in the framework of the potential approach .",
    "thus , we can factorize the amplitude of the weak decay of heavy quark with account for the hard gluon exchange with the spectator quark and the amplitude of soft binding of `` free '' quarks into the heavy quarkonium .    in the present paper , in the framework of this hard - soft factorization , we perform the calculation of the @xmath0 decay width under the diagrams on figure 1 , so that @xmath9 that is quite greater than the extrapolation estimates of potential models",
    ". therefore , we believe , that the possible probability of the practical @xmath2 observation in the current experiments is enforced in the @xmath0 mode .",
    "in the framework of the nonrelativistic formalism for the heavy quark binding into the @xmath10-wave quarkonium , we assume , that the quark momentum , entering the meson , is equal to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the four - velocity of quarkonium , so that the quarks inside the meson move with one and the same four - velocity @xmath13 . moreover , the quark - meson vertex with nontruncated quark lines corresponds to the spinor matrix @xmath14 for the vector quarkonium with @xmath15 , being the polarization vector , and @xmath16 for the pseudoscalar quarkonium , so that @xmath17 is the @xmath18-level mass and @xmath19 is related with the value of configuration wave function at origin @xmath20 the @xmath19 quantity can be related with the leptonic constants of states @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the vector and axial - vector currents of the constituent quarks . then the account for hard gluon corrections in the first order over @xmath24 @xcite results in @xmath25\\;,\\\\ \\tilde f & = & f_p\\ ; \\bigg[1 - \\frac{\\alpha_s^h}{\\pi } \\biggl(\\frac{m_2-m_1}{m_2+m_1}\\ln\\frac{m_2}{m_1 } - 2\\biggr)\\bigg]\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 are the masses of quarks , composing the quarkonium . for the vector currents of quarks with equal masses ,",
    "the blm procedure of the scale fixing in the `` running '' coupling constant of qcd @xcite gives @xcite @xmath27 for the quarkonium with @xmath28 , we assume @xmath29 further , the factor of the colour wave function @xmath30 stands in the quark - meson vertex .",
    "the @xmath31 meson current corresponds to the axial - vector current of weak transition @xmath32 .",
    "then the matrix element of @xmath0 decay , calculated under the diagrams on figure 1 , takes the form @xmath33 where @xmath13 is the four - velocity of @xmath2 meson , @xmath34 is its mass , @xmath35 is the polarization vector of @xmath5 particle , @xmath36 is its mass , @xmath37 is the product of the @xmath2 and @xmath5 four - velocities , @xmath38 in eq.([t ] ) @xmath24 is given at the scale of the gluon virtuality @xmath39 so that @xmath40 as is seen from eq.([kg ] ) , the virtuality of hard gluon is comparable with the square of charmed quark mass , and it points to the applicability of the hard process factorization .",
    "the corresponding virtualities of @xmath41 and @xmath42 quarks , interacting with the hard gluon , are equal to @xmath43 note , that one numerically gets , that the virtual @xmath41-quark in the second diagram of figure 1 is in the @xmath44-channel , since its four - momentum has a negative square .",
    "therefore , one can see , that the corresponding contribution into the @xmath45 decay is quite a nonspectator one .    from eq.([t ] ) one gets the expression for the total width of @xmath0 decay @xmath46 in numerical estimates , we suppose @xcite @xmath47 and we use the one - loop expression for the @xmath24 evolution @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the number of quark flavours with @xmath51 , @xmath52 using @xmath53 @xcite , one finds , that @xmath54 mev and @xmath55 mev .",
    "further , the @xmath56 constant was estimated in the framework of qcd sum rules @xcite @xmath57 and it is in a good agreement with the scaling relation for the leptonic constants of @xmath3 heavy quarkonia @xcite @xmath58 then the account for the hard gluon corrections gives @xmath59    the total width of the decay is equal to @xmath60 where we have supposed @xmath61 gev @xcite .    to calculate the branching ratio of the @xmath0 decay , we evaluate the total @xmath2 meson width due to the formula @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the contribution of @xmath42-quark decays with the @xmath64-quark , being the spectator , @xmath65 determines the contribution of @xmath64-quark decays with the @xmath42-quark , being the spectator , and with the account for the phase space reduction , because of the @xmath64-quark binding inside @xmath2 ( i.e. one takes into account the deviation from the exact spectator consideration ) , and @xmath66 is the contribution of annihilation channels , depending on @xmath67 and @xmath56 . then @xmath68 and @xmath69 note , that in the given estimates of eqs.([gam ] ) and ( [ br ] ) , we do not include into the consideration the @xmath70 factor , caused by the hard gluon corrections to the effective four - fermion weak interactions of quarks .",
    "@xmath70 is evaluated for free quarks , so that @xmath71 @xcite . in the current consideration ,",
    "one of the heavy quarks in the @xmath72 transition is hardly virtual , and we use the factorization of @xmath31 meson current , so that the corresponding @xmath24 correction would look as the higher order gluon contribution to the @xmath73-boson and quark vertex .",
    "we do not account for such higher order corrections in the present consideration .",
    "further , the purely spectator decay of @xmath74 has the total width , equal to @xmath75 that corresponds to @xmath76 where the axial - vector current contribution is equal to one half of estimate ( [ spec ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the matrix element , corresponding to the first diagram on figure 1 , approximately equals the matrix element , following from the second diagram , and hence , estimate ( [ br ] ) is four times enforced due to the @xmath44-exchange nonspectator contribution .",
    "we believe , that the given enhancement is quite acceptable .",
    "in the present paper we have shown , that in the @xmath0 decay , the hard recoil momentum of @xmath5 particle leads to that , the formalism of the weak transition form factor calculation , based on the overlapping between the nonrelativistic wave functions for the heavy quarkonia , goes out the framework of the applicability , since the hard gluon exchange with the spectator quark results in the large virtuality of heavy quark in the weak transition current . in the considered case",
    ", the amplitude of the weak decay with the hard exchange by gluon can be calculated in the framework of qcd perturbation theory and it can be factorized from the amplitude of soft binding of heavy quarks in the quarkonium .",
    "the calculation with the account for this hard - soft factorization results in @xmath9 where the accuracy is basically restricted by uncertainties in the evolution scale of the qcd `` running '' coupling constant , in the charmed quark mass and the total @xmath2 width .",
    "the given estimate of the branching ratio for the @xmath0 decay mode is significantly greater than the extrapolation results of potential models .",
    "this value strongly enforces a practical probability of @xmath2 observation in the current fnal and lep experiments with vertex detectors .        * * s.s.gershtein , v.v.kiselev , a.k.likhoded , a.v.tkabladze , uspekhi fiz.nauk 165 ( 1995 ) 1 .",
