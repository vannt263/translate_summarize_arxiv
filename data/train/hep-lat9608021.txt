    "the symanzik action improvement program has been proposed@xcite as a way to reduce scaling violations in the approach to the continuum limit from a lattice action . in this contribution",
    ", we report on our investigations into the nature of scaling violations inherent in improved actions .",
    "we perform @xmath0 quenched spectroscopy using a one - loop tadpole - improved symanzik pure gauge action and compare the tree - level tadpole - improved clover fermion action with the standard wilson fermionic action .",
    "we measure the hadron spectrum and the string tension at lattice spacings @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath10 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 fm .",
    "the goal of this work is to measure the lattice spacing dependence of the hadron spectrum .",
    "we find significant scaling violations in @xmath11 consistent with @xmath2 for clover fermions and @xmath1 for wilson fermions .",
    "however , wilson fermions show a nonnegligible @xmath2 term . without this correction ,",
    "continuum extrapolations of @xmath11 decrease with increasing @xmath12 ; hence , reliable continuum extrapolations are problematic .",
    "in this work , we used the tadpole improved 1-loop correct symanzik pure gauge action described in ref.@xcite .",
    "classically , this action has @xmath13 errors but quantum effects induce @xmath14 errors .",
    "however , it was shown @xcite that the gauge action is insensitive to nonperturbative tuning of the coefficients suggesting that the @xmath14 errors are small .",
    "= 0.45    we compute hadron spectroscopy using the wilson action , and the tadpole - improved version of the tree - level clover fermionic action proposed in @xcite . with this tree - level action , one expects quantum errors of @xmath15 .",
    "however , naik @xcite computed the one loop and the dominant two loop contributions to @xmath16 and finds that after tadpole improvement the coefficient of @xmath17 is @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , we expect to see only the dominant @xmath2 fermionic errors .",
    "recently , the clover coefficient with the wilson gauge action was computed nonpertubatively  @xcite and was found to deviate significantly from the tadpole value . since our gauge actions differ from  @xcite at @xmath2 , we can not use this result in the present work .",
    "to set the scale , @xmath19 , we used the string tension .",
    "we computed finite @xmath20 approximations to the static quark potential using time - like wilson loops @xmath21 which were constructed using ` ape'-smeared spatial links @xcite .",
    "we extracted the string tension from the fitted `` effective '' potentials .    for hadron measurements , we used correlated multi - state fits to multiple correlation functions as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we computed quark propagators in coulomb gauge at several @xmath22 values for each @xmath3 .",
    "we used two gaussian source smearing functions with smeared and local sinks .",
    "fitting ranges were chosen by an automated procedure  @xcite .",
    "we generated @xmath23 quenched configurations using the symanzik gauge action @xcite on a @xmath24 lattice at @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "we expect finite volume effects to be small since the box size is @xmath31fm at @xmath32 .",
    "we originally had problems with exceptional configurations on @xmath33 at @xmath34 . with the larger physical volume",
    ", we reduced this problem .",
    "the cost of inversions increased ; however , we compensated for this by using the method of ` @xmath35 ' fermion sources  @xcite to increase the statistics per inversion .",
    "our main result for the determination of scaling violations is in figure  [ rho_sig_fig ] .",
    "we extrapolate the vector mass to the physical @xmath37 ratio and plot the result of @xmath11 for wilson and clover . fitting the functional form of the scaling violations , we find that the confidence level @xmath38 is @xmath39 for wilson assuming @xmath1 errors and @xmath40 assuming @xmath2 .",
    "we are confident then that the wilson scaling violations are not consistent with only @xmath2 . however , as we drop the lower @xmath3 points in the @xmath1 ansatz , we @xmath38 and the intercept rise indicating that quadratic scaling corrections are not small .",
    "this is not too surprising since the clover result varies by @xmath41 over the range of the fit while the wilson result varies @xmath42 .",
    "fitting to both @xmath1 and @xmath2 we have @xmath43 and an intercept of @xmath44 with an @xmath2 term that is two standard deviations away from @xmath45 .",
    "this mixed ansatz is plotted in figure  [ rho_sig_fig ] .    for clover ,",
    "unfortunately , @xmath38 is large for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 anstze ; hence , we can not discern the scaling violation order solely by @xmath38 .",
    "however , the extrapolated value of @xmath11 is @xmath46 compared to @xmath47 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 anstze , resp .",
    "hence , only the @xmath2 ansatz is compatible with the wilson continuum prediction .",
    "we find that the @xmath2 fit is stable after dropping low @xmath3 points .",
    "furthermore , the gf11 and milc collaborations find a consistent continuum extrapolation using wilson and staggered fermions , resp .",
    "using the mixed @xmath1 and @xmath2 ansatz for clover , we find the fit has a linear term that is zero within errors ; hence , we will ignore this fit . to adequately resolve the problem of @xmath1 and @xmath2 scaling",
    ", we would need a simulation at @xmath48fm .",
    "another main feature of the extrapolation is the slope . for wilson fermions",
    ", we find the coefficients of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 terms ( the slopes ) are @xmath49 mev and @xmath50 . for clover , we find the coefficient of the @xmath2 term is @xmath51 .",
    "these slopes are consistent with the characteristic soft scale of light spectroscopy @xmath52 .",
    "we find smaller slopes for the nucleon and delta .    in figure  [ n_rho_sig_fig ]",
    ", we plot the ratio of @xmath53 assuming @xmath2 scaling violations for clover .",
    "we find a continuum value of @xmath54 that is consistent with the gf11 result@xcite ; however , it is different than the experimental value of @xmath55 . for the delta ,",
    "we obtain a continuum value of @xmath56 for clover compared to @xmath57 for gf11 .",
    "our wilson continuum extrapolations using only an @xmath1 ansatz are consistently below the clover and gf11 extrapolations ."
