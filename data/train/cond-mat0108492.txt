    "recent achievements in electronic device miniaturization allow one to study the mesoscopic superconducting samples with sizes of the order of the coherence length @xmath0 . such structures attract a considerable current interest as a possible basis for low temperature electronics .",
    "the superconducting state was studied experimentally for different - shaped samples : discs , loops , double loops , dots etc .",
    "it was shown that the sample shape and sizes affect significantly the phase diagrams of the mesoscopic superconductors .",
    "the vortex phases in mesoscopic superconductors are commonly studied within the framework of the ginzburg - landau theory @xcite . as it is well - known from the microscopic theory , the ginzburg - landau approach gives accurate results provided that the order parameter undergoes only slight spatial variation on the lenght scale of @xmath1 .",
    "this means that the ginzburg - landau theory can be used in the temperature range not far from @xmath2 .",
    "however , it is known from the experience that it is also able to give reasonable results beyond this limit .",
    "the ginzburg - landau solutions for axially symmetric mesoscopic samples ( cylinders , discs ) can be subdivided into two different types @xcite . in the first case",
    "the modulus of the local order parameter is axially symmetric inside the sample .",
    "the superconducting vortex - free state , the single - vortex state , and the giant - vortex state belong to this type of solutions . in the second case",
    "the axial symmetry is broken and a vortex cluster is formed inside the sample ( multivortex phase ) .",
    "this state usually appears at lower fields and larger sample sizes as compared to the giant - vortex phase @xcite . note that multivortex state corresponds to the abrikosov flux - line lattice for the bulk superconductors .    the phase diagram of mesoscopic superconductor is strongly influenced by the boundary condition for the order parameter . in general case",
    "it is given by the de gennes boundary condition @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the unit vector normal to the sample surface , @xmath5 is the de gennes  extrapolation length ",
    ", @xmath6 is the vector potential , and @xmath7 is the order parameter . here and below the following dimensionless variables are used : distances , magnetic field , and the order parameter are measured in units of coherence length @xmath0 , bulk upper critical field @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , respectively , with @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the ginzburg - landau coefficients .",
    "the `` extrapolation length ''",
    "@xmath5 has a physical meaning of a length scale of the order parameter variation at the sample surface .",
    "microscopic considerations show that @xmath5 depends on the properties of interface , it is maximum for an ideal surface with the mirror reflection of quasi - particles and minimum for the rough surface with the diffusive reflection @xcite . for the superconductor - dielectric ( or vacuum )",
    "interface we have @xmath12  in the former case and @xmath13 in the latter case .",
    "the value of @xmath5 depends also on the surface orientation provided that a superconducting gap is anisotropic .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( 1 ) that the order parameter is suppressed in the vicinity of the sample surface at @xmath14 . for the superconductor - normal metal interface",
    "@xmath5 is always small , @xmath15 , because of diffusion of normal electrons from the metal to the superconductor .",
    "the  extrapolation length ",
    "@xmath5 in this case is a function of temperature and various characteristics of metal and interface @xcite .",
    "there are also possibilities for the enhancement of the order parameter at the interface that can be described by negative @xmath5 values .",
    "it can be realized by choosing the suitable material as a surrounding medium @xcite , i.e. , a superconductor having a higher transition temperature then the material of the mesoscopic sample .",
    "another possibility is to use a semiconductor as a surrounding medium , such that there is a overlap of the band gap of the semiconductor with the superconducting gap . for the case of isotropic superconductor - vacuum ideal interface ( @xmath12 ) ,",
    "the magnetic properties of mesoscopic cylinders and discs , their equilibrium and non - equilibrium phase diagrams were studied in numerous papers , see e.g. refs .",

    "@xcite . in ref . @xcite the ginzburg - landau equations were solved numerically and self - consistently for superconducting state in long cylinders .    in this paper",
    "we focus on magnetic properties of mesoscopic cylinders under the general boundary condition for the order parameter corresponding to the opposite case of _ suppressed _ surface superconductivity . for this purpose",
    ", we propose a variational approach and solve the ginzburg - landau equations without straightforward integration using trial functions for the order parameter .",
    "these trial functions involve a set of variational parameters yielding , as we show , more accurate quantitative description of the spatial distribution of the order parameter than frequently used lowest landau level approximation .",
    "the approach is applicable to all vortex phases ( the vortex - free , the single - vortex , the multivortex , and the giant vortex states ) and any values of de gennes  extrapolation length  .",
    "the comparison of variational calculations with some available exact results demonstrates good accuracy of our approximation .",
    "the model enables us to calculate the equilibrium @xmath16-@xmath17 diagram of the cylinder , where @xmath16 is the external field and @xmath17 is the cylinder radius .",
    "the magnetization curves of the cylinder are calculated .",
    "let us consider a cylindrical type - ii superconductor placed in the uniform external magnetic field @xmath16 parallel to the cylinder axis . the sample is assumed to be much longer than london penetration depth @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , both the order parameter and the magnetic field are constant along cylinder axis .",

    "it is easy to show that the vector potential and the magnetic field at leading order are given by :    @xmath35    the order parameter at leading order @xmath36 is determined by the first ginzburg - landau equation ( 2 ) and the boundary condition ( 1 ) at @xmath37 .",

    "( 9 ) is enough for an accurate calculation of the energy of the mesoscopic superconductor in multivortex state .",
    "the vortex cluster with @xmath44 vortices on a ring and no vortex at the axis ( ring - like configuration ) can be described as a mixture of two components with @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( ( @xmath50 ) state ) .",
    "the vortex cluster with one vortex at the cylinder axis and @xmath51 vortices on a ring corresponds to @xmath52 and @xmath49 ( ( @xmath53 ) state ) .",

    "the value of @xmath61 can be found from boundary condition ( 7 ) :    @xmath62    our approach is to consider the coefficients @xmath60 as variational parameters and to minimize the free energy with respect to @xmath60 .",

    "the oscillatory behavior of the function @xmath88 is caused by the fact that the transition occurs from the normal to the giant vortex states with different angular quantum moments @xmath44 depending on the cylinder radius .",
    "besides , the function @xmath88 depends appreciably on the value of @xmath5 : the value of @xmath89 decreases with decrease of @xmath90 at @xmath91 the dependence @xmath88 tends to the surface critical field for the half - space sample , which was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite as a function of @xmath92 .",
    "note that @xmath87 @xmath93 for @xmath12 and @xmath94 @xmath95 for @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "below @xmath87 the transitions between different giant vortex states take place .",
    "solid lines show the phase boundaries between the states with different vorticities that are the sums of angular quantum moments of all vortices and giant vortices . in the giant vortex state",
    "the order parameter is strongly suppressed in the inner part of the cylinder , and this state can be referred to a surface superconductivity . for illustration , the spatial distribution of the order parameter in the giant vortex phase with @xmath97",
    "is plotted in fig . 2 at @xmath84 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 ( a ) and @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 ( b ) ( solid lines ) . in the former case",
    "the order parameter is also suppressed at the sample surface because of the small @xmath5 value ( e.g. , superconductor - normal metal interface ) . to check the accuracy of our approach we took into account next several terms in expansion ( 11 ) , thus increasing the number of variational parameters .",
    "as we found , this practically did not change the calculated order parameter for almost all points of @xmath16-@xmath17 diagram shown in fig .",
    "this result implies that our variational calculations are close to the exact solutions of the ginzburg - landau equations since expansion ( 11 ) is written without any loss of generality .",
    "therefore , one can find ginzburg - landau solution with any desired accuracy ( for the states with axially symmetric modulus of the order parameter ) allowing for enough number of variational parameters @xmath103 . for multivortex states",
    "the accuracy is limited by the fact that we take into account only two main harmonics in the fourier expansion ( 9 ) . in fig .",
    "2 we also plotted the spatial variation of the order parameter calculated within the lowest landau level approximation ( dashed lines ) . in this approximation",
    "the order parameter is proportional to the eigenfunction of the kinetic energy operator corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue .",
    "we found that this approach remains very accurate not far from @xmath104 and @xmath87 ( see fig .",
    "2(a ) ) . at lower fields the results of the lowest landau level approximation are not so accurate ( fig .",
    "2(b ) ) .    as follows from fig .",
    "1 , the superconducting state does not nucleate at very small cylinder radii , smaller than some critical radius , and the sample is in normal state at any applied field .",
    "the critical radius tends to zero at @xmath12 .",
    "there is also the interval of @xmath17 for each @xmath5 , when the vortex phase does not nucleate , and the transition occurs from the normal to the superconducting vortex - free state .",
    "every vortex phase with vorticity @xmath105 can exist in the form of the giant vortex or the multivortex configuration .",
    "the dashed lines on fig .",
    "1 show the boundaries between these states .",
    "below these lines for given @xmath105 the multivortex state has the lowest energy , and above these curves the giant vortex state becomes more energetically favorable . in equilibrium state the multivortex phase can exist if the applied field is smaller than @xmath46 ( @xmath106 in dimensional units ) and if the radius of the cylinder is large enough .",
    "for each @xmath5 there exists an interval of small cylinder radii , when the multivortex phase is energetically unfavorable as compared to the states with axial symmetric distribution of the modulus of the order parameter .",
    "curve 2 in fig .",
    "1 shows the lower critical field that corresponds to the equilibrium boundary between the vortex - free and the single - vortex states .    with increasing the external field the cylinder can follow rather complex set of phase transitions .",
    "it can come from the giant vortex to the multivortex states and then back to the giant vortex phase .",
    "for example , at @xmath107 , @xmath84 the following set of transitions occurs : @xmath108:@xmath109:@xmath110:@xmath111 . at @xmath112 , @xmath113",
    "the set of transitions is : @xmath114:@xmath115:@xmath116 .",
    "the transitions between the phases with different vorticities are always discontinuous , they occur when the energies of different states become equal .",
    "the transitions between the states with the same vorticity may be continuous as well as discontinuous .",
    "continuous phase transitions occur between the multivortex and the giant vortex states . in this case , with increasing of the applied field the intervortex distances decrease , and vortices merge into the giant vortex located at the cylinder axis . the similar results were obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite  for the case @xmath113 and in ref .",
    "@xcite  at @xmath117  ( enhanced surface superconductivity ) . in our calculations we also took into account a possibility of existence of the multivortex clusters with central vortex .",
    "it turned out that such configurations can be more favorable energetically than giant vortex states in some regions of @xmath16-@xmath17 diagram shown in fig .",
    "1 . however , in all these cases the ring - like clusters have the lower energy . for cylinders thicker than shown in fig .",
    "1 we found that at any @xmath118 the ground state can be represented by configurations with the central vortex . the transitions between multivortex states of the same vorticity with and without central vortex are discontinuous .    with increasing of the cylinder radius the number of vortices , which it is able to accomodate , increases , and",
    "finally vortex array transforms to the classical triangular abrikosov flux - line lattice far from the surface .",
    "the first step on this way is the appearance of the clusters with central vortex .",
    "however , we do not analyze here the transition from the mesoscopic to the macroscopic behavior and restrict ourselves on few - fluxoid cylinders , which can accomodate only few vortices before the thansition to the normal state and whose magnetic properties can be described in terms of mixture of only two harmonics in eq .",
    "now we find the magnetization of the cylinder using eq .",
    "the results of our calculations at @xmath119 are presented in fig .",
    "3(a ) for @xmath84 , @xmath120 and in fig .",
    "4(a ) for @xmath12 , @xmath121 . in these cases the cylinders",
    "accommodates the giant vortices with maximum angular quantum moments equal to @xmath122 and @xmath123 , respectively , before the transition to the normal state .",
    "jumps in the magnetization correspond to the transitions between the states with different vorticity .",
    "it is interesting that in the state with suppressed surface superconductivity ( fig .",
    "3(a ) ) the discontinuity of the field dependence of the magnetization is less pronounced , especially at high fields . in the first case ( fig .",
    "4(a ) ) at @xmath124 ( @xmath125 in dimensional units ) the transition occurs from the multivortex state with @xmath126 vortices to the giant vortex state with angular quantum momentum @xmath126 ( @xmath127:@xmath128 . in the second case ( fig .",
    "4(b ) ) the transition @xmath129:@xmath130 occurs at @xmath131 and the transition @xmath132:@xmath133 occurs at @xmath134 .",
    "all these transitions are followed by weak jumps in the slope of the magnetization .",
    "the behavior of the magnetization near the transitions is shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) and 4(b ) .",
    "solid lines denote the equilibrium magnetization , dashed lines denote the metastable magnetization corresponding to the giant vortex phase . the similar behavior of the magnetization in the vicinity of the multivortex - giant vortex transitions was reported in ref .",
    "[ 34 ] for the case @xmath135 .",
    "next we discuss the accuracy of our variational procedure .",
    "first , we compare the variational results with known exact solutions for the surface critical field .",
    "the phases with axial symmetric distribution of the modulus of the order parameter are always energetically more favorable with respect to the multivortex state at applied field higher than the bulk upper critical field ( see phase diagrams on fig .",
    "1 ) . in the vicinity of the surface critical field the first ginzburg - landau equation ( 1 ) can be linearized .",
    "a resulting equation has the following analytical solution @xcite :    @xmath136    where @xmath137 is kummer function . function ( 19 ) must meet the boundary condition ( 7 ) .",
    "this yields the transcendental equation for the surface critical field allowing one to find @xmath88 exactly .",
    "the comparison of the variationally calculated @xmath138 with this exact dependence shows good agreement with an accuracy better than @xmath139 for all values of @xmath5 and @xmath17 under study .",
    "the lower critical field of the cylinder @xmath140 versus @xmath17 was calculated numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite at @xmath135 .",
    "the comparison of this result with our dependence @xmath141 reveals the same accuracy .",
    "thus , our results appear to be a good approximation to the exact ginzburg - landau solutions for the mesoscopic cylinders .    in summary , we analyzed the superconducting state in long mesoscopic cylinder with suppressed surface superconductivity .",
    "an asymptotic expansion was used to simplify the ginzburg - landau equations at high and moderate values of @xmath33 , and the simplified equations were solved by variational method .",
    "the equilibrium @xmath16-@xmath17 diagram of the cylinder were obtained , where @xmath16 is the external field and @xmath17 is the cylinder radius , at different values of  extrapolation length  .",
    "we showed that magnetic properties of the cylinder depend appreciably on the value of  extrapolation length  and studied the evolution of @xmath16-@xmath17 diagram with changing of  extrapolation length  .",
