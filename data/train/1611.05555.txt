    "the trivial quandle is referred to as a rack to emphasize that the second and not the first axiom of a quandle is playing a role here .",
    "there are several spindles which are associative . ] which satisfies the associativity axiom .",
    "this is bad news for lbo homology from a knot theoretic point of view .    in 2015",
    ", it was proven that shelves with an identity element ( unit ) are associative .",
    "the proof follows from the following two propositions .",
    "[ proposition 1 sam c. ] for a unital shelf @xmath0 , the following axioms hold :    1 .",

    "@xmath9 for all @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath10 for all @xmath4 .",
    "a shelf satisfying all the three axioms in the above proposition is called a * pre unital shelf * and a shelf satisfying the second and the third axioms of the above proposition is called a * proto unital shelf*. the converse of proposition [ proposition 1 sam c. ] does not hold but it is easy to observe that removing the unit element from a unital shelf gives a pre unital shelf and adding unit element to a pre unital shelf gives a unital shelf @xcite .",
    "[ proposition 2 sam c. ] proto unital shelves are associative .",
    "the relations between the various algebraic structures discussed above is summarized in figure [ firstfig ] .",
    "it is well known that to construct a homology theory it is enough to construct a pre - simplicial module ( also known as semi - simplicial module ) .",
    "the pre - simplicial module allows for a chain complex to be constructed by defining the boundary map as the alternating sum of the face maps of the pre - simplicial module @xcite .",
    "lbo homology is developed in the same way .",
    "a * pre - simplicial module * @xmath11 consists of a sequence of @xmath12-modules @xmath13 over a ring @xmath12 for @xmath14 , and face maps @xmath15 for all @xmath16 such that for @xmath17 , @xmath18    now let @xmath19 and for all @xmath20 , let @xmath21    it is not difficult to observe that @xmath22 , so that @xmath23 is a chain complex . following is the same construction in the context of lbo homology .",

    "let @xmath25 for @xmath16 be given by ,    @xmath26     face map of lbo homology . ]",
    "the next thing to prove is that @xmath27 is a pre - simplicial module .",
    "but before proving this , some examples are considered to illustrate how the face maps use the axioms of an associative shelf .",
    "a non - trivial case in the above definition would occur when @xmath28 .",
    "part ( 1 ) of example [ examples of computation of face maps ] explains that case .",
    "[ examples of computation of face maps ] let @xmath29 .    1 .   for @xmath28 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 . here",

    "3 .   let @xmath35 .",
    "then @xmath36 . @xmath37",
    "the example above implies that the axioms necessary for @xmath27 to be a pre - simplicial module are the associativity axiom and @xmath38 for @xmath1 .",
    "the second axiom holds for associative shelves as , @xmath39    [ existential proof of lbo homology ] @xmath27 is a pre - simplicial module .",
    "the proof of this proposition requires a careful organization of the various possibilities for the sole axiom of a pre - simplicial module and dividing them in to multiple cases .    1 .   for @xmath40 , checking each of the small number of possibilities suffices .",
    "2 .   let @xmath41 that is when @xmath42 and @xmath43 are adjacent to each other .",
    "an arbitrary element in the domain of @xmath44 looks like @xmath45 .",
    "then , @xmath46 + on the other hand , @xmath47 + under the axioms of associative shelves and using [ lengthaxiom equation ] it follows that both sides are equal .",

    "then , @xmath50 on the other hand , @xmath51 + in this case , associativity is the only axiom necessary to show the equality of the two expressions .",
    "4 .   let @xmath52 .",
    "this case is almost trivial as the @xmath44 face map and the @xmath53 face map do not interact with each other at all and therefore the axiom of a pre - simplicial module follows immediately without the need of any axioms of an associative shelf .",
    "the cases when @xmath54 , that is when @xmath43 is at the right end is similar except a shift in indexes and are left for the reader to verify .    in each of the above cases except the first , @xmath55 . as the face maps of the _ potential _ pre - simplicial module are cyclic in nature",
    ", this rules out the possibility of the @xmath53 face map affecting the @xmath44 map by coming around , or vice - versa . if otherwise , it is dealt with in a separate case and is not mentioned here to avoid increasing the length of this proof .    the above proposition and defining the boundary maps @xmath56 in the usual way as the alternate sum of the face maps of the pre - simplicial module leads on to the following theorem .",
    "@xmath23 is a chain complex .",
    "the homology groups obtained from the chain complex in the above theorem will be called the * lbo homology groups*. the boundary maps of this homology are cyclic in nature .",
    "it turns out that by using similar face maps but not in a cyclic manner , it is possible to form a different homology theory .",
    "this homology theory is described briefly in the following subsection .",
    "it is important to note here that while the associativity axiom is always necessary for lbo homology , it is possible to exchange the right self - distributivity axiom with idempotence .",
    "therefore , lbo homology also works if the algebraic structure of interest is an idempotent semi - group .",
    "although there is a non - trivial intersection between associative shelves and idempotent semi - groups in the form of associative spindles , there is no containment in either direction .",
    "see figure [ relations between associative shelves and idempotent semi - groups ] .",
    "further , one can also work with semi - groups satisfying the axiom @xmath57 for all @xmath58 semi - group .",
    "example [ examples of computation of face maps ] part ( 1 ) , illustrates the face maps @xmath59 and @xmath60 when @xmath28 .",
    "it follows that @xmath61 , for @xmath62 .",
    "this implies that lbo homology measures _ how far _ a proto unital shelf or idempotent semi - group is from being commutative .",
    "in particular , when the algebraic structure under consideration is finite and commutative , the zero homology group is @xmath63",
    ".    it would be useful to extend the pre - simplicial module leading on to lbo homology to a simplicial module for the useful implications .",
    "i do not know how to do it .",
    "the pre - simplicial module leading on to lbo homology , however , can be extended to a _ very weak simplicial module _ for special families of associative shelves and idempotent semi - groups .",
    "the notion of a very weak simplicial module was introduced in @xcite .    a * simplicial module * @xmath64 consists of a sequence of @xmath12-modules @xmath13 over a ring @xmath12 for @xmath14 , face maps @xmath15 , and degeneracy maps @xmath65 for all @xmath66 such that ,    1 .",

    "now consider the pre - simplicial module @xmath11 leading on to lbo homology . to convert it to a very weak simplicial module",
    "a degeneracy map is necessary which satisfies axioms 2 and 3 in the last definition .",
    "let @xmath0 be a magma .",
    "if there exists an element @xmath73 such that @xmath74 for all @xmath75 then @xmath76 is called a * zero*.    there are many associative shelves and idempotent semi - groups with zeros .",
    "table [ is and as ] shows one example of each . in particular , any associative shelf or idempotent semi - group",
    "can be extended to another associative shelf or idempotent semi - group by adding a zero element .",

    "the one term and rack homology groups of associative shelves were studied in @xcite . in particular , it was proven that for associative shelves with a right fixed element the rack homology groups are @xmath89 in all dimensions .",
    "moreover , it was observed that proto unital shelves always have right zero .",
    "table [ computational data for associative shelves ] indicates that lbo homology groups of proto unital shelves are not constant .",
    "unital shelves have trivial one term homology groups in all positive dimensions .",
    "in particular , one term homology groups of shelves with either a left zero or a right unit are trivial in all positive dimensions @xcite . again , from table [ computational data for associative shelves ] one may infer that lbo homology of such shelves is more interesting .      with the very limited computational data that is there",

    "one possible way to attack the above conjecture is by studying the homotopy type of the cw complex formed by the geometric realization arising from lbo homology .    there are not many geometric interpretations of the idempotence axiom .",
