    "semi - leptonic decays of @xmath19 mesons have been the focus of much activity in the last few years .",
    "experimentally , their rather large branching ratios have allowed thorough studies of their properties .",
    "theoretically , they have been a fertile ground for new ideas .",
    "moreover , the interplay between these experimental studies and new theoretical ideas has led to a greater understanding of the flavour sector of the standard model and , in particular , to measurements of the less well - known cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements @xmath12 and @xmath20@xcite .",
    "the main theoretical development in the study of hadrons containing a heavy quark , such as the @xmath21 or @xmath22 quarks , is undoubtedly the discovery of heavy - quark symmetry@xcite and the development of the heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet)@xcite , which describes the strong interactions of a heavy quark with gluons and light quarks at low energies .",
    "if one considers the masses of the @xmath21 and @xmath22 quarks to be much larger than the qcd scale , @xmath23 , one finds that the dynamics of the light quarks and gluons coupled to a @xmath21 or a @xmath22 quark become independent of this heavy quark s flavour and spin . in this limit",
    ", qcd exhibits a new @xmath24 symmetry , known as heavy - quark symmetry , which acts on the multiplet @xmath25 .",
    "this symmetry simplifies considerably the description of the decays of hadrons containing a heavy quark .",
    "for instance , the 20 form factors required to describe the semi - leptonic decays @xmath17 and @xmath18 as well as the elastic form factors of @xmath26 and @xmath27 mesons , is used to distinguish mesons in which the light , spectator antiquark is @xmath28 from those in which it is either @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "] can all be expressed in terms of two universal form factors , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , known as isgur - wise functions@xcite , which parametrize the non - perturbative dynamics of the light degrees of freedom .",
    "@xmath31 describes the decays of mesons containing a heavy quark and a @xmath29 or @xmath30 antiquark , and @xmath32 describes the decays of mesons containing a heavy quark and an @xmath28 antiquark .",
    "moreover , heavy - quark symmetry requires these isgur - wise functions to be 1 when @xmath33 , the square of the four momentum transfer , is maximum@xcite .    in an earlier work@xcite",
    ", we obtained the isgur - wise functions @xmath31 from a lattice study of elastic @xmath34 meson scattering . a similar approach , but with a different lattice action , was taken by bernard et al.@xcite and led to very similar results . in the present paper ,",
    "we extend our earlier work to include decays of the form @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a heavy - light pseudoscalar meson composed of a heavy quark , @xmath37 , with a mass around that of the charm quark , and a light antiquark , @xmath38 .",
    "these processes are described by matrix elements of the vector current @xmath39 .",
    "these matrix elements can , in turn , be decomposed in terms of two form factors , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , given by = ( v+v)^+(v - v)^[matelt ]  , where @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the mass of @xmath45 .    in the limit of exact ,",
    "the two form factors become independent of the masses of the initial and final heavy quarks and & & 0 + & & ( )  , [ hql ] where @xmath46 is an isgur - wise function of the type described above , whose exact functional form only depends on the quantum numbers of the light spectator antiquark .",
    "the only change we make to these quantum numbers in the present paper is to vary the light antiquark mass . for simplicity of notation , this dependence will be left implicit unless stated otherwise .    for heavy quarks of finite mass",
    ", there are two sources of corrections to the simple results of .",
    "the first is hard - gluon exchange between @xmath47 and @xmath48 across the vector current vertex .",
    "the second results from the modifications of the vector current and meson states by higher - dimension operators in hqet .",
    "these latter corrections are proportional to inverse powers of the heavy - quark masses .",
    "thus , we have h^i(;m_q , m_q)=(^i+^i(;m_q , m_q)+^i(;m_q , m_q))[corr ]  , for @xmath49 , where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 represents the radiative corrections and @xmath53 , the power corrections .",
    "it is important to note that these two corrections incorporate all of the mass dependence of the form factors @xmath54 . as defined in , the isgur - wise function , @xmath55 , is renormalization - group invariant@xcite and normalized to one at zero recoil as required by @xcite : [ iwnorm ] ( 1)=1  .",
    "the radiative corrections can be evaluated analytically in qcd since they are perturbative . to quantify them ,",
    "we use neubert s short - distance expansion of heavy - quark currents@xcite .",
    "he considers semi - leptonic @xmath0 and @xmath13 decays and computes radiative corrections to the corresponding heavy - quark matrix elements to order @xmath56 as a function of @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "his calculation improves the previous leading logarithmic evaluation of these corrections@xcite in two ways : firstly , he includes next - to - leading logarithms in running the @xmath59 heavy - quark operators from @xmath58 down to scales at which hqet can be safely used , and secondly , he obtains , to order @xmath56 , the full dependence of the heavy - quark current on the mass ratio @xmath60 .",
    "the sum of these new contributions is as large as the leading logarithmic term .",
    "corrections to neubert s computation contribution at one loop . ]",
    "are of order @xmath61 with @xmath62 and should be smaller than 1% .",
    "the fact that neubert s result accounts for the full order @xmath56 dependence of the heavy - quark current on the mass ratio @xmath63 is important for us , because our range of heavy - quark masses is quite small ( see ): @xmath63 ranges from 0.6 to 1 .",
    "the power corrections are proportional to powers of @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the energy carried by the light degrees of freedom in the mesons .",
    "@xmath65 will of course depend on what these light degrees of freedom are . in what follows",
    ", we will use @xmath66@xcite when working with light degrees of freedom with spin @xmath67 and isospin @xmath67 . because @xmath68 for the heavy quarks we are considering , we would naively expect power corrections in @xmath69 and @xmath70 to be of order 15 to 30% .",
    "these corrections are difficult to quantify because they involve the light degrees of freedom and are therefore non - perturbative .",
    "theorem@xcite , however , guarantees that there are no @xmath71 corrections to @xmath69 at zero recoil and one may expect that power corrections to @xmath5 remain small away from zero recoil .",
    "this is not expected to be true for @xmath6 which is not protected by luke s theorem .    for degenerate transitions where @xmath72 , conservation of the vector current @xmath73 provides further constraints on the radiative and power corrections : ^+(1;m_q , m_q ) & = & 0 + ^+(1;m_q , m_q ) & = & 0 + ^-(;m_q , m_q ) & & 0[degencond ] + ^-(;m_q , m_q ) & & 0  , where the last two equations hold for all @xmath74 .",
    "our results come from a quenched simulation on a @xmath2 lattice at @xmath3 on a sample of 60 gauge field configurations@xcite .",
    "the lattice has an inverse lattice spacing of around @xmath75  @xcite .",
    "we do not suffer much here from errors associated with uncertainties in the determination of the lattice spacing since our main results are dimensionless and depend at most logarithmically on the scale .",
    "our light quarks have masses which bracket the strange quark mass .",
    "because our heavy quarks have masses in the region of the charm - quark mass which are large in lattice units ( up to a half or more ) , we must contend with discretization errors proportional to powers of @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the mass of the heavy quark . in order to reduce these discretization errors",
    ", we use the @xmath78-improved fermion action originally proposed by sheikholeslami and wohlert@xcite with which discretization errors in operator matrix elements and hence in our form factors are reduced from @xmath79 to @xmath80@xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in we",
    "present the details of our simulation , as well as our strategy for obtaining the form factors @xmath5 and @xmath6 from the calculated three - point functions .",
    "in we discuss discretization errors and describe a procedure which enables us to subtract some of these errors non - perturbatively . in",
    "we present our results for the form factors @xmath5 and @xmath6 for three values of the light antiquark mass and all available initial and final heavy - quark combinations .",
    "we also extrapolate @xmath5 in the light - antiquark mass to the chiral limit , and interpolate it to the strange quark mass . in",
    "we study the dependence of @xmath5 and @xmath6 on heavy - quark mass and attempt to extract the leading power corrections .",
    "we find that @xmath5 displays no measurable dependence on heavy - quark mass which enables us to conclude that this form factor is an isgur - wise function once radiative corrections are subtracted . in , we study the dependence of @xmath5 on the light - quark mass and extract the isgur - wise functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we find that the slopes of these functions at @xmath81 are [ xiudp ] _ u , d(1)=-[0.9 ] and [ xisp ] _",
    "s(1)=-[1.2 ]  .we thus observe a slight decrease in the magnitude of the slope light - antiquark mass ; given the errors , however , the significance of this observation is limited .",
    "we compare our results for these  to other theoretical as well as experimental determinations .",
    "we find excellent agreement with experiment . in",
    "we use our isgur - wise function @xmath31 to extract the ckm matrix element @xmath12 from different experimental measurements of the differential decay rate for @xmath13 decays .",
    "our results for @xmath82 are summarized in and are compared to other determinations of this matrix element .",
    "our procedure for extracting @xmath82 differs from that proposed by neubert@xcite in that we fix the @xmath74 dependence of the differential decay rate with our calculation instead of obtaining it from experiment .",
    "this enables us not only to extract @xmath82 with no free parameters , but also to check the validity of non - perturbative qcd against experiment .",
    "we find that the @xmath74 dependence predicted by our calculation agrees very well with the results of the aleph@xcite and cleo@xcite collaborations . in",
    ", we use @xmath31 and @xmath32 to compute the branching ratios for @xmath17 and @xmath18 decays , and our results are summarized in .",
    "we also compute ratios of semi - leptonic widths and find = 3.2 ( lat . )",
    "1.0(hqs ) and = 3.3 ( lat . ) 1.0(hqs )  , where the first set of errors was obtained by adding our lattice statistical and systematic errors in quadrature and the second set of errors , denoted by `` hqs '' , quantifies the uncertainty due to neglected power and radiative corrections .",
    "we confront our predictions for these branching ratios and ratios of widths with experimental measurements where available and find that they compare quite favourably .",
    "finally , in we present our conclusions .",
    "since we are studying the decays of quarks whose masses are large in lattice units , we must control discretization errors . in order to reduce these errors ,",
    "we use an @xmath4-improved fermion action originally proposed by sheikholeslami and wohlert@xcite , given by s_f^sw = s_f^w - i_x,,|q(x ) f_(x)_q(x ) , [ sclover ] where @xmath83 is the wilson action : s_f^w = _ x \\{|q(x)q(x ) - _ } [ sfw ]  . the leading discretization errors in matrix elements for",
    "heavy - quark decays obtained from numerical simulations with the fermion action are reduced from @xmath79 to @xmath84 and @xmath85 , provided one also uses `` improved '' operators obtained by `` rotating '' the field of the heavy quark , q : q(x)(1-)q(x )  .",

    "we use gauge - invariant jacobi smearing on the heavy - quark field ( described in detail in ref .",

    "the computation of the matrix element @xmath95 proceeds along lines similar to earlier calculations of the electromagnetic form factor of the pion and to determinations of the form factors corresponding to semi - leptonic decays of the @xmath34 meson into light mesons .",

    "the results for @xmath176 with @xmath186 presented above differ from the value of @xmath143 given in by about 10 - 20% for the range of quark masses used in our simulations ( for @xmath187 , which corresponds approximately to the charm quark for both values of @xmath188 , the difference is about 12% ) .",
    "this difference is a good indication of the size of mass - dependent discretization errors in our calculation ; it is consistent with our expectation that they should be of @xmath189 and @xmath161 .    our results for",
    "@xmath162 also enable us to quantify the dependence of discretization errors on momentum as well as on the lorentz component of the current used to obtain them . as noted in the previous subsection ,",
    "the difference between the results obtained with @xmath179 and with @xmath158 is less than 1% .",
    "this is a clear indication that as long as we limit ourselves to momenta @xmath184 such that @xmath190 , discretization errors proportional to @xmath191 are small .",
    "as for the dependence of @xmath162 on the lorentz index of the current , the situation is less clear .",
    "the ratio @xmath192 for @xmath193 indicates that this dependence could be as large as 11% .",
    "however , given that the statistical errors on @xmath194 are quite large , much of this dependence could be a statistical fluctuation .",
    "having isolated and quantified the different sources of discretization errors , we now investigate the possibility of subtracting these errors .",
    "it is important to remember that these discretization errors are given by matrix elements of higher dimension operators : they are non - perturbative and will depend on the initial and final states between which the current @xmath87 is sandwiched .",
    "this means that in any attempt to subtract them , one must evaluate the relevant corrections with states as similar as possible to the ones which appear in the matrix element of interest .",
    "with this in mind , we have devised the following subtraction procedure .",
    "firstly , as mentioned in , we assume that the mass - dependent discretization errors can be absorbed into an overall effective normalization : p(p)||qq| p(p)_lat.=  , [ overallzv ] where @xmath195 is defined in .",
    "secondly we find a normalization condition , i.e.  a kinematical point at which we know the physical value of the matrix element .",
    "for the case of degenerate transitions , this normalization condition is simple ; electromagnetic charge conservation requires that @xmath196 . for the case of non - degenerate transitions , the normalization condition is slightly more complicated .",
    "hqet requires , as we saw earlier , that @xmath197 . the radiative corrections , @xmath198 , we know from perturbation theory .",
    "the power corrections , @xmath199 , are non - perturbative and are yet to be determined in a model - independent and reliable way .",
    "we are , however , helped here by luke s theorem which guarantees that @xmath200 is free of corrections proportional to a single power of the inverse heavy - quark masses .",
    "thus , @xmath201 and is small .",
    "in fact , as we shall see shortly , the exact size of @xmath199 is not important for determining the isgur - wise function .",
    "thus , we will take our normalization condition to be h^+(1;m_q , m_q)1+^+(1;m_q , m_q ) [ normcond ] for both degenerate and non - degenerate transitions .",
    "this condition determines @xmath162 . with @xmath162",
    "defined by we find z^eff_v= +  , [ zveffhq ] where @xmath202 is the zero - recoil form factor obtained from our lattice calculation and the @xmath152 stands for discretization errors which are not euclidean invariant . because , as we mentioned earlier , discretization errors made in the evaluation of a matrix element depend not only on the initial and final states considered , but also on the procedure used to obtain the matrix element",
    ", it is very important to obtain @xmath202 with a procedure as similar as possible to the one used to obtain @xmath40 for @xmath203 .",
    "thus , we get @xmath202 from the time - component of the ratio of with @xmath204 . for degenerate transitions ,",
    "there is another zero - recoil channel , which corresponds to the forward scattering of a meson with one unit of lattice momentum .",
    "we do not use the @xmath205 from this channel to determine @xmath162 because it is statistically much noisier than the one at zero momentum , and because it does not correspond to a zero - recoil transition in the non - degenerate case .",
    "now , to subtract the discretization errors that @xmath153 incorporates , we simply define the continuum form factors to be & & ( 1+^+(1;m_q , m_q ) ) + & & ( 1+^+(1;m_q , m_q ) )  . [ hphmdef ] this definition yields & & [ 1++-^+(1;m_q , m_q ) + & & + d^+(;m_q , m_q ) -d^+(1;m_q , m_q ) ]  , [ myhp ] up to higher - order discretization errors , radiative and power corrections .",
    "it is clear from that part of the discretization errors have been subtracted .",
    "the subtraction is only complete , however , if @xmath206 is a constant . for the form factor @xmath207 it is less clear that we are subtracting the relevant discretization errors . indeed , according to the definition of the discretization errors in @xmath6 are @xmath208 .",
    "however , the assumption behind this subtraction is the same as the one made by lepage , mackenzie and kronfeld @xcite in their attempt to remove discretization errors by modifying the normalization factors which match fermion fields to their continuum counterparts .",
    "we wish to emphasize here that our subtraction procedure removes non - perturbatively all discretization errors which do not break euclidean invariance and does so to all orders in @xmath151 .",
    "thus , amongst others , all discretization errors which are removed in mean - field theory by the procedure of kronfeld , lepage and mackenzie will be removed non - perturbatively by our procedure .",
    "as indicates , in subtracting discretization errors in @xmath5 , we also subtract the zero - recoil power corrections , @xmath209 , thereby losing the ability to determine them .",
    "this is not a serious concern in practice because these ought to be small  they are proportional to the square of the inverse heavy - quark mass  and therefore difficult to isolate reliably .",
    "it does mean , however , that even if we can reduce all of our errors to the percent level , we will be unable to obtain the zero - recoil power corrections to the form factor @xmath210 relevant for @xmath13 decays if we use an analogous subtraction procedure .",
    "this is unfortunate because these @xmath211-corrections are one of the dominant theoretical uncertainties in the extraction of the ckm matrix element @xmath12 from experimental studies of these decays ( see ) .    for obtaining the isgur - wise function ,",
    "however , the fact that our normalization procedure subtracts these zero - recoil power corrections , which are non - perturbative and difficult to quantify , is an advantage .",
    "our hope is that , once these corrections are subtracted , the resulting form factor will have smaller power corrections away from zero recoil .",
    "there is one additional issue surrounding normalization that we wish to address . as indicated in the previous subsection , the discretization errors on our  are typically larger for spatial than for temporal channels ( see ) .",
    "thus , we ought to normalize spatial and temporal channels differently . for degenerate transitions ,",
    "this is possible because there is a zero - recoil  which has a non - zero spatial component : @xmath212 .",
    "as mentioned above , however , this  does not correspond to a zero - recoil decay when @xmath213 .",
    "we have no zero - recoil  with a non - vanishing spatial component for non - degenerate transitions ( momenta are quantized on the lattice ) .",
    "so , in order to treat degenerate and non - degenerate transitions in the same way , we will normalize @xmath5 and @xmath6 as described in .",
    "it is important to note that because @xmath5 is obtained from the temporal component of alone ( see end of ) and is correctly normalized , it does not suffer from the possible discrepancy in normalization between temporal and spatial channels .",
    "it is @xmath6 , obtained from both temporal and spatial components , which in fact will absorb this discrepancy . for degenerate transitions , where @xmath6 is in principle zero , the values of @xmath6 that we obtain are therefore an indication of how large an error this discrepancy can induce in the form factors . for non - degenerate transitions , the values of @xmath6",
    "we obtain , though contaminated to some extent by discretization errors , can be used to put bounds on the physical @xmath6 .",
    "in  we present the measurements of @xmath69 , @xmath214 and @xmath70 which we obtain for all available combinations of the initial and final heavy - quark masses for light antiquarks with @xmath215 ( ) , 0.14226 ( ) and 0.14262 ( ) . in these tables , the first @xmath216-column corresponds to the fit which yields @xmath217 from the temporal component of the ratio @xmath110 assuming @xmath218 .",
    "the second @xmath216-column corresponds to the fit which gives @xmath219 from both temporal and spatial components when holding @xmath111 fixed to its temporal - component value .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom ( @xmath220 ) that we quote in this second column depends on the momentum channel because the number of non - vanishing equations for @xmath111 and @xmath112 varies with initial and final meson momenta .",
    "as evidenced by the low values in the first @xmath216 column of all three tables , the fits which give @xmath111 from the temporal component of @xmath110 are very good .",
    "the fact that the values in the second @xmath216 column of these tables are generally larger may be due to the fact that spatial and temporal components of our  may have different discretization errors , as mentioned in .",
    "when we fit these components simultaneously to the asymptotic form of while holding @xmath111 fixed , we are not fitting to a form which takes into account these discrepancies and consequently obtain a larger @xmath216 . as discussed in , however ,",
    "this fitting strategy is the only one that guarantees that @xmath5 does not suffer significantly from discretization errors .    given the number of different mass combinations and momentum channels we have , our results for @xmath214 are remarkably consistent . keeping the light - quark mass fixed",
    "we find that for recoils @xmath74 which are approximately the same , the values of @xmath214 are equal within errors even when they are obtained from different momentum and/or heavy - quark mass combinations .",
    "this supports the validity of our procedure and is also an indication that the radiative corrections obtained using neubert s results@xcite are accurate .",
    "the fact that @xmath214 does not appear to depend strongly on the mass of the heavy quarks is also an indication that the coefficients of the corrections proportional to inverse powers of the heavy - quark masses are not very large ( see ) .",
    "there are two momentum combinations on which we wish to comment .",
    "the first is @xmath221 to @xmath222 which , for degenerate transitions , has zero recoil . for such transitions",
    ", current conservation requires that @xmath223 equal 1 .",
    "we find values of @xmath223 which are just barely consistent with 1 at the level of 1 @xmath224 for @xmath215 .",
    "the situation deteriorates when the mass of the light quark decreases ( see and ) . since for given quark masses @xmath223",
    "is extracted from a single three - point function ( the one with @xmath222 and @xmath225 ) , it is much more susceptible to statistical fluctuations than most other values of @xmath5 which are obtained from averages of three - point functions over many equivalent momentum combinations . to show that this slight discrepancy is statistical , we consider two measures of @xmath223 which use the same and normalization .",
    "the first is h^+((/12a,0,0)(/12a,0,0))= with @xmath162 defined in .",
    "the second is the expression above multiplied by the ratio @xmath226 @xmath227 where @xmath227 is the average of the six @xmath228 , @xmath229 and @xmath230 . using the values of @xmath162 given in",
    ", the first procedure gives @xmath223 equal to 1 to within 1% , even when the mass of the light spectator antiquark is reduced , while the second procedure gives results very much in line with the rather low results of , and .",
    "the reason why the first procedure is more precise is explained in footnote  [ footseven ] . moreover , that the results given by the second procedure agree better with our standard procedure for obtaining @xmath5 should not be too surprising , as the latter also makes use of average two - point functions .",
    "the second small inconsistency we wish to comment on is the one arising from the comparison of @xmath231 with @xmath232 , for which @xmath74 is the same . to check the validity of our results",
    ", we have re - analysed our data by fitting our  directly to the asymptotic form given in , fixing the energies and wavefunction factors which appear in this asymptotic form to their  values , and normalizing the resulting @xmath116 according to",
    ". this procedure yields values for @xmath5 which are nearly identical to the ones given in tables [ hp.4144 ] , [ hp.4226 ] and [ hp.4262 ] .",
    "the only values that change significantly compared to the size of their error bars are those corresponding to @xmath231 . in this different way of analyzing the data , the values we find for @xmath231 are lower , making them nearer the values for @xmath232 .",
    "this partial bridging of the gap , however , comes at the expense of large @xmath216 s , ranging from 2 to 5 .",
    "one can fix both problems  bridging the gap completely and bringing the @xmath216 down  by fitting the time component of our  to [ thptlimde ] c^0_3(t;p,q)_qq_t , t_f - t  e^-(e_p - e_p+e)t - e_pt_fp(p)|v^0_i(0 ) |p(p )  , with an extra parameter @xmath233 , instead of to the form given in .",
    "the parameter @xmath233 is designed to absorb slight statistical differences in the time behavior of two- and .",
    "one would worry about the consistency of adding this extra parameter if it were to be large compared to the values of the various energies which enter the exponential factor in since it is inconsistent to allow for changes in the energies while holding wavefunction factors fixed  the two quantities are extremely correlated  and it is inconsistent to claim that @xmath234 is different for two- and  but that @xmath100 is the same .",
    "however , we find values of @xmath233 which are on the order of @xmath235 and consistent with zero .",
    "in addition to reconciling the values for @xmath231 and @xmath232 , this method increases the statistical errors on all values of @xmath69 because of the additional freedom introduced by the new parameter .",
    "we do not use this new fitting method as our main one because of the potential inconsistencies mentioned above and because the introduction of the extra parameter @xmath236 is difficult to generalize sensibly to situations where one simultaneously fits more than one four - vector component of a .",
    "the results given by all of these different methods of analyzing the data are consistent within statistical errors .",
    "this gives us faith that the results for @xmath5 in , and are valid representations of our data .",
    "the most likely reason , then , for the slight discrepancy between @xmath231 and @xmath232 is that it arises from the same statistical fluctuation that yields the low value for @xmath237 . like the three - point function which gives @xmath237",
    ", the one from which @xmath232 is obtained is not averaged with equivalent three - point functions .",
    "@xmath231 , on the other hand , is obtained from the average of the six  corresponding to the transitions @xmath238 , @xmath239 , @xmath240 .    as mentioned earlier",
    ", current conservation requires that @xmath241 for degenerate transitions . in order to determine whether our results are consistent with this requirement",
    ", we must know how large the discretization errors on @xmath70 might be . as suggested by the results for @xmath153",
    "( see ) , there may be discretization errors of the order of 10% which cause the spatial components of our  to be low compared to the temporal components .",
    "one can easily convince oneself , by considering the set of equations corresponding to different components of the vector current in , that such discretization errors would cause @xmath242 to take on values up to about @xmath243 .",
    "this is indeed what we find .",
    "thus , to the level of accuracy with which we can determine @xmath242 , we can conclude that @xmath70 is consistent with zero for degenerate transitions .    for non - degenerate transitions ,",
    "the results we obtain for @xmath70 resemble very much those found in degenerate transitions .",
    "they are consistent with zero at the level of 2@xmath224 is large with large errors when @xmath244 , because its coefficient in the equation which determines it is @xmath245 , a small number when @xmath246 . ] .",
    "thus , as far as we can resolve , @xmath70 is small for all @xmath74 , most probably less than about @xmath243 to @xmath247 .    using this information",

    "using the fact that the ratio of velocity factors , latexmath:[$r\\equiv    and that @xmath69 is always greater than @xmath249 , we find that the error we make on @xmath69 is at most @xmath250 to 2% . in most situations , if not all , it will be smaller than that .",
    "thus , neglecting the contribution of @xmath70 in obtaining @xmath69 is a very good approximation indeed .      in the previous section",

    "we established in the previous section that , for fixed light - antiquark mass , we can combine the results for @xmath214 corresponding to different values of the initial and final heavy - quark mass .",
    "we further established that the resulting function is an : @xmath309 when the mass of the light antiquark vanishes ; @xmath310 when the light antiquark is given the mass of the strange quark .",

    "we fit the corresponding data to the parametrizations @xmath311 , @xmath267 .",
    "the parameter @xmath270 is added to absorb possible uncertainties in the normalization of these form factors . because the parametrization @xmath267 is only one of many possible parametrizations , we also fit our results to @xmath312 , @xmath313 , @xmath314 and @xmath315 where [ lin ] _",

    "the fact that the values of @xmath216 are relatively high for all of these fits should not in itself be taken as an indication that the parametrizations of , ( [ lin ] ) and ( [ quad ] ) are poor representations of the isgur - wise functions .",
    "these large values of @xmath216 are due to the discrepancy that we mentioned in between our measurements of @xmath231 and of @xmath317 . because of this discrepancy , no parameterization can fit our data with a good value of @xmath216 .",
    "@xmath216 s nevertheless seem to favor the use of the extra parameter @xmath270 but does not seriously discriminate between @xmath311 , @xmath318 and @xmath319 .",
    "we have tried fitting our data to yet other parametrizations and of all the fitting functions , @xmath318 yields the lowest values for @xmath320 .",
    "the reason for this is that @xmath318 is the only parametrization which does not have positive curvature .",
    "since @xmath318 is in that sense an exception , we will not use it as our standard fitting function but because it is a valid parametrization for these isgur - wise functions we will make certain that our results have errors which encompass the values it gives for the slope . furthermore , since both @xmath311 and @xmath319 give nearly identical fits ( see ) , we will use @xmath311 as our standard in the following because it has one less parameter and yields better @xmath216 s .",
    "having already argued in that , with the normalization that we have adopted , the remaining mass - dependent discretization errors are small , we turn to momentum - dependent lattice artefacts . to quantify these momentum - dependent discretization errors we resort to the following procedure .",
    "we fit the data for @xmath309 and @xmath310 for fixed initial and final meson momentum and all heavy - quark combinations , to the parametrization @xmath311 .",
    "the variation in the results of fits to these different momentum sets should give us some indication of how large these momentum - dependent lattice artefacts are .",
    "some of this variation , of course , may be due to statistical fluctuations of the sort we mentioned in .",
    "we summarize the results of the fits to the different momentum sets in .",
    "it is reassuring that the value of @xmath270 for the case @xmath321 is very close to 1 , because the corresponding data are our best points .",
    "they are the points for which our normalization procedure is optimal because they are obtained from  which are much more correlated with the  which yields the normalization factor @xmath205   and @xmath322 are strongly correlated is because they are built up from the same exponentiated propagator . indeed ,",
    "the initial momentum in our notation is the momentum of the exponentiated propagator . ] .",
    "furthermore , these data have the smallest statistical errors and should have the smallest discretization errors , because the momenta of the incoming and outgoing mesons are less than or equal to the initial and final momenta of other momentum sets .",
    "to accommodate the spread in the values in the slope parameters @xmath323 and @xmath324 corresponding to @xmath309 and @xmath310 , we assign systematic errors to these parameters which encompass all the central values given in . the central value and statistical errors that we quote are given by fitting @xmath311 to all momentum sets put together ( see ) .",
    "thus , our final results for the slope at @xmath288 are [ rho2ud ] ^2_u , d=0.9 for @xmath309 and [ rho2s ] ^2_s=1.2 for @xmath310 . even though the exact values of these slope parameters are slightly different if different parametrizations for the  are used , these differences are well within our error bars .",
    "in we compare our predictions for the slope of the  @xmath31 and @xmath32 with those of other authors .",
    "we find that our predictions for @xmath320 lie safely above the lower bound of bjorken@xcite and below the upper bound of de rafael and taron@xcite .",
    "our results for @xmath324 also agree with the lattice result of bernard et al .",
    "@xcite obtained with wilson fermions for a light spectator antiquark with mass @xmath325 , although the details and systematics of the two calculations are different .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite do not quote a value of @xmath323 for vanishing light - quark mass .    also for comparison , we quote an average experimental value for the slope of the isgur - wise function compiled by neubert@xcite from very recent results of the aleph@xcite and cleo@xcite collaborations as well as older data from the argus collaboration@xcite : ^2_u , d(expt.)=0.87(12)(20 )  , [ rho2udexpt ] where the second error is theoretical and accounts for the uncertainty in the size of @xmath326 corrections@xcite .",
    "agree remarkably well .",
    "as can be inferred from and from our results are compatible with the statement that @xmath320 is constant with light - quark mass , possibly decreasing slightly as this mass decreases .",
    "such a decrease is consistent with one s intuition that it is more difficult to make the light degrees of freedom recoil , the heavier these degees of freedom are .",
    "furthermore , hgaasen and sadzikowski@xcite find a decrease in slope which is very similar to the trend we observe in the central value of @xmath320 when we include the extra parameter @xmath270 in our fits .",
    "in fact , our predictions for @xmath320 itself are in excellent agreement with theirs .",
    "their prediction is based on an improved bag model calculation and is an extension of earlier work by sadzikowski and zalewski@xcite . a similar decrease in slope with spectator quark mass",
    "is observed by close and wambach@xcite though the values they quote for @xmath323 and @xmath324 are slightly larger than the ones we find .    to test the robustness of our predictions for @xmath320",
    ", we have explored many different procedures for obtaining @xmath69 , two of which we have already described in . to obtain @xmath69 for degenerate transitions ,",
    "we have in addition tried normalizing our lattice results for @xmath116 by @xmath327 instead of by @xmath328 ( see ) .",
    "when fitted to the @xmath329 parametrizations , the results obtained using all of these methods give very similar values for the slope parameter @xmath320 .",
    "they only differ in the value of @xmath270 they predict , i.e.  in their overall normalization .",
    "thus , we are quite confident that our predictions for the slope are reliable but believe that it is important to allow for the extra normalization parameter @xmath270 .",
    "in we obtained @xmath69 for a variety of @xmath330 transitions where @xmath96 ( @xmath331 ) is a pseudoscalar meson composed of a heavy quark @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) and a light antiquark @xmath38 . in our study , both @xmath47 and @xmath48 are quarks with masses around that of the charm quark . in , however , we showed that our results for @xmath214 are independent of heavy - quark mass for masses around the charm quark mass or larger .",
    "this means , modulo the issue of power corrections at zero - recoil , that our results can be used to describe not only @xmath330 transitions with @xmath332 but @xmath333 decays as well , where the subscript @xmath334 labels the flavour of the light antiquark . in , we studied the dependence of @xmath214 on the mass of the light , spectator quark , @xmath335 , and obtained results for @xmath309 and @xmath310 .",
    "all of this means that our result for @xmath31 , once multiplied by @xmath336 , is in fact the form factor @xmath5 relevant for @xmath337 transitions , while @xmath338 is the form factor @xmath5 relevant for @xmath339 transitions .",
    "now , the differential decay width for @xmath0 is , in the limit of zero lepton mass,@xcite [ btodrate ] = & g_f^2|v_cb|^248 ^ 3 ( m_b_(s)+m_d_(s))^2  m_d_(s)^3(^2 - 1)^3/2 + & | - |^2  .",
    "so , in principle , we could obtain @xmath82 by comparing our theoretical prediction for @xmath340 to an experimental measurement of this rate . a major problem with this approach , however , is that the rate @xmath340 is helicity suppressed , as evidenced by the factor @xmath341 , so that it is very difficult to get accurate experimental measurements close to @xmath288 where the predictions of hqet are most reliable .",
    "another problem with obtaining @xmath82 from @xmath17 decays is that one must know @xmath70 to better accuracy than is given by our calculation : an error of 0.1 on @xmath6 leads to an uncertainty of about 10% in the rate .",
    "we should mention , however , that neubert@xcite has estimated @xmath6 using perturbation theory and sum rules in hqet and has found that its magnitude does not exceed 0.04 over the whole range of recoils @xmath74 .",
    "if this is true , its contribution to the rate of should not exceed 4% .    we have not exhausted the predictions of heavy - quark symmetry .",
    "we have yet to exploit the spin component of this symmetry . using a combination of the spin and flavour symmetry",

    "this means that @xmath352 is a collection of radiative and power corrections ( see ) , many of which are kinematically suppressed : deviations of @xmath352 from 1 ought to remain small .",
    "neubert estimates@xcite , using perturbation theory and sum rules in hqet , that @xmath352 may reduce the slope parameter , @xmath320 by 0.09 which corresponds to an enhancement of the rate by about 10% at maximum recoil and by a smaller amount for smaller @xmath74 .",
    "however , we can not estimate yet how the physical @xmath352 deviates from its value in the heavy - quark limit from our lattice calculation .",

    "we neglect the @xmath348 power corrections to @xmath5 since they appear to be small ( see ) but add a 10% error to account for possible higher order power corrections .",
    "we further neglect the contribution of @xmath6 in accordance with neubert s findings that this form factor is smaller than 0.04 over the whole range of @xmath74 ( see discussion after ) but add 20% to our errors since an @xmath372 is consistent with radiative corrections and order of magnitude estimates of power corrections .",

    "this is much smaller than the @xmath384 corrections one is entitled to expect for form factors not protected by luke s theorem .",
