    "the quantum nature of atomic motion alters thermal and mechanical properties of condensed matter at low temperatures .",
    "the most striking feature is the well - known quantum mechanical freezing of solids below the debye temperature : specific heat and thermal expansion vanish as the temperature approaches absolute zero  @xcite .",
    "this behavior is different from what we would expect from classical statistical mechanics .",
    "a `` classical solid '' typically has a positive expansion coefficient at low temperatures and a specific heat close to @xmath4 per atom",
    ".    path integral monte carlo ( pimc )  @xcite and path integral molecular dynamics ( pimd )  @xcite are convenient numerical methods to predict the proper low - temperature properties of condensed matter , provided that model potentials are available that describe the interatomic interactions sufficiently well . so far , most pimc and pimd studies have been restricted to the calculation of structural and thermal properties of quantum solids or to the calculation of equations of state of condensed rare gases .",
    "the computation of the tensor of the elastic constants , which is an important material property in many engineering applications , however , has not been put forward yet in the framework of path - integral simulations .",
    "the proper evaluation of the elastic constants is far more complicated than textbooks on solid state physics make us believe , because it is not sufficient to calculate second derivates of interaction potentials at equilibrium ( or thermal ) positions and construct from this the various @xmath1 .",
    "as shown by squire , holt , and hoover ,  @xcite thermal fluctuations of a generalized strain tensor can alter elastic constants significantly .",
    "of course , quantum fluctuations can be expected to result in a similar effect .",
    "these fluctuations vanish at small temperatures for classical systems , but they do not necessarily vanish for quantum mechanical systems .",
    "another difficulty is that quantum solids do not adopt a configuration at @xmath5  k where the potential energy surface is minimized . instead",
    ", the atoms also probe non - harmonic parts of the potentials due to quantum fluctuations , typically leading to lattice constants that are slightly increased with respect to the equivalent classical system .    in this paper",
    ", we want to propose two methods which enable us to determine accurately elastic constants of solids such that quantum effects of the atomic motion are fully included in the treatment .",
    "one possibility is to use the definition of the elastic constants as the second derivative of the free energy with respect to strain tensor elements and evaluate the final expression in the @xmath0 ensemble .",
    "this procedure is similar to the method proposed by squire , holt , and hoover ,  @xcite with the difference that our partition function is quantum mechanical .",
    "alternatively , one can perform simulations in the @xmath2 ensemble and relate the fluctuations of the strain tensor to the elastic constants as has been originally done by parrinello and rahman for classical systems .",
    "@xcite    both methods are prone to produce large statistical error bars . in classical simulations ,",
    "the computation of elastic constants using the @xmath2 ensembles is known to be much less efficient than in the @xmath0 ensemble  @xcite .",
    "however , the estimator derived for the quantum simulations in the @xmath0 ensemble can be expected to become unreliable when the trotter number @xmath6 in the path - integral simulation becomes large , just like the so - called primitive estimator for the kinetic energy  @xcite .",
    "it is thus necessary to discuss the prospective statistical errors in detail .",
    "it is important to note that presently only isothermal quantum mechanical elastic constants can be calculated .",
    "adiabatic elastic constants can only be obtained if simulations are carried out in the @xmath7 ensemble or the @xmath8 ensemble .",

    "it will be shown , how , simple corrections to primitive estimators can reduce their statistical incertainties considerably .",
    "we will also briefly review the method to determine @xmath11 in the @xmath2 ensemble as well as the simulation algorithm that is used for the applications . in sec .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "as pointed out correctly for classical systems  @xcite , isothermal elastic constants  @xcite @xmath1 are insufficiently described if they are evaluated solely on the basis of averageing the so - called born contribution @xmath12 @xmath13 which is the thermal average of the second derivative of the potential energy @xmath14 with respect to strain tensor elements @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the @xmath0 ensemble .",
    "the full elastic constants are obtained if @xmath17 is replaced with the free energy @xmath18 , e.g. , @xmath19 with @xmath20 the isothermal partition function .",
    "this proper definition results in corrections to @xmath12 .",
    "the leading correction terms @xmath21 are fluctuations of the ( generalized ) instantaneous strains .",
    "these terms have the form @xmath22 where again the expectation values are evaluated in the @xmath0 ensemble . as far as classical elastic constants are concerned , the only missing contributions @xmath23 to the correct @xmath1 stem from the ideal gas part of the partition function .",
    "these kinetic corrections are given by @xmath24 or in tensor notation for cubic symmetry @xmath25 note that one has to properly symmetrize when using the voigt notation , e.g. , @xmath26 .",
    "the originally suggested values  @xcite for @xmath27 , @xmath28 and their symmetry related @xmath29 are in error by a factor of two .",
    "the correct values are @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 . while this kinetic contribution can usually be neglected in classical simulations , knowing the correct form is crucial for quantum systems as can be seen further below .",
    "thus , in classical solids at non - zero temperaures , the elastic constants can be estimated as @xmath33 .",
    "the quantum statistical formulation of the partition function of @xmath34 identical particles with mass @xmath35 in terms of a path - integral formulation  @xcite is given by @xmath36 with @xmath37 the thermal de broglie wavelength at temperature @xmath38 and the effective potential @xmath39 @xmath40 here , the coordinate of particle @xmath41 at `` trotter time '' @xmath42 is denoted as @xmath43 and @xmath44 denotes the distance between particle @xmath41 and @xmath45 at `` trotter time '' @xmath42 .",

    "it is helpful to consider different contributions to the elastic constants . in order to do this ,",

    ", we want to suggest how one can easily improve on the statistical properties of so - called primitive estimators in pimd simulations . as a first step",
    "we define a function @xmath82 which measures how far the averaged tensor of the kinetic energy deviates from its expectation value @xmath83 where @xmath84 represents the ( kinetic ) mass of particle @xmath41 at trotter time @xmath42 ( note that kinetic masses can be chosen arbitrarily independent of the physical mass  @xcite ) and @xmath85 is the @xmath86 component of its velocity .",
    "@xmath87 symbolizes an expectation value obtained in a simulation .",

    "the external potential is locally only a small perturbation to the springs connecting neigbored beads on the ring . due to the conversion of kinetic energy to potential energy , similar deviations from the exact thermodynamic average",

    "this is due to the development of efficient sampling methods in the meantime  @xcite which suppress slowing down with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "the new estimator has a strongly reduced statistical noise as compared to the original one , yet , results in the correct expectation value .",
    "furhtermore , using larger time steps than in our production runs , we have noticed that systematic errors due to finite - time steps , are considerably reduced as well with the new estimator .",
    "we want to note that in later production runs for strongly quantum mechanical systems such as solid @xmath3he , statistical error bars obtained with the new estimators are as small as statistical error bars asscociated with the so - called virial estimator  @xcite .",

    "the classical representation is defined by eqs .",

    "argon is a convenient test case for the calculation of quantum - mechanical elastic constants , because it lies in between what is considered a quantum solid like solid helium under pressure , and what is considered a `` classical '' solid like solid xenon . for the argon test - case , we intend to determine the shift of the quantum mechanical elastic constants with respect to the classical elastic constants and the relative importance of the individual contributions to the net result .",

    "the relative effects in @xmath115 and @xmath116 are similar .",
    "note that this effect of a @xmath117 reduction in @xmath111 is considerably larger than the increase in the lattice constant of about 1% or the decrease of 10% of the heat of formation .",

    "as expected , differences between classical and quantum results become negligible as the temperature approaches ( or surpasses ) the debye temperature , which in the case of argon is @xmath119  k.      while argon shows significant differences between classical and quantum mechanical elastic constants , the corrections due to the kinetic energies are farily small .",
    "helium , in particular @xmath3he , is much more `` quantum '' than argon and therefore a more challenging test case than argon .",
    "the solid forms of @xmath3he are only stable under pressure .",

    "it is necessary to go to large temperatures and low pressures . yet , we want to avoid to be too close to a phase transition , e.g. , the fcc fluid phase transition .",
    "the combination of @xmath124  k and @xmath125  mpa seems to be an appropriate choice : the quantum limit is basically reached with trotter number @xmath126 and the transition to the fluid phase takes place at sufficiently higher temperature , namely at @xmath127  k. although the thermodynamic stability field of the hcp phase is located at temperatures @xmath128  k for the applied pressure , one may certainly expect metastability of the fcc phase in the time window accesible to our simulations .",

    "`` classical '' helium would have @xmath136  gpa at the same external temperature and pressure . from fig .",
    "[ fig : c11_he_fcc ] we can see that it is possible to approximate the elastic constants fairly reasonably if only the born contribution and the contribution due to the fluctuating real potential are included into the calculation .",

    "fcc and hcp phase can both be considered to be classically stable at low temperatures , because their free energy differences are small .",
    "an interesting phenomena in the ( quantum mechanical ) bcc phase is the radial distribution function @xmath137 : the peaks in @xmath137 can not easily be related to nearest neighbors , next neighbors , etc . , but the contributions of different neighboring shells `` group '' together .",

    "condensed helium is highly quantum mechanical and therefore provides an ideal test ground for the application of many - body quantum statistical theories .",
