    "inclusive meson production from transversely polarized @xmath3 collisions have an analyzing power , @xmath5 , which provides insight into the composite structure of the proton . the analyzing power , or transverse single spin asymmetry , is quantified by taking the ratio of the difference and sum of independent polarized processes :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the average beam polarization",
    ", @xmath8 is a geometric scale factor that corrects for the azimuthal acceptance of the detector , and @xmath9(@xmath10 ) is the meson production cross section from @xmath11(@xmath12 ) + @xmath13 beam crossings . in prior measurements , non - zero",
    "transverse single spin asymmetries have been measured for charged pion production at large feynman-@xmath14 ( @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the momentum of the meson along the beam direction ) at various energies @xcite .",
    "measurements of the @xmath1 meson transverse single spin asymmetry have also been made , and are shown in figure [ fig : etaan ] . the e704 experiment measured an @xmath1 meson transverse single spin asymmetry comparable with the @xmath17 transverse single spin asymmetry at @xmath4 = 19.4 gev @xcite , and more recently the star experiment measured a very large @xmath1 meson transverse single spin asymmetry at @xmath4 = 200 gev , much larger than the @xmath17 transverse single spin asymmetry @xcite .    two previous measurements of @xmath1 meson transverse single spin asymmetry .",
    "the left figure is from fnal - e704 at @xmath4 = 19.4 gev @xcite .",
    "the right figure is from the star experiment at @xmath4 = 200 gev @xcite . ]",
    "since collinear pqcd at leading twist predicts a small spin asymmetry due to the hard partonic scattering , initial and final states of the interacting partons and fragmenting hadrons have to be considered .",
    "two main explanations have been developed to explain these transverse single spin asymmetries , the sivers and collins effects .",
    "the sivers effect @xcite is a correlation between the spin of the proton and the intrinsic transverse momentum of the parton .",
    "the collins effect @xcite is a correlation between the final state hadron and the initial spin of the proton and parton .",
    "the goal of this analysis is the extraction of the inclusive @xmath1 meson transverse single spin asymmetry at forward rapidity at phenix @xcite for @xmath4 = 200 gev @xmath18 collisions .",
    "for the analysis of the forward @xmath1 meson transverse single spin asymmetry in phenix , the muon - piston calorimeter ( mpc ) is used .",
    "the mpc consists of two forward electromagnetic calorimeters , referred to as the south ( north ) mpc , placed @xmath19220 cm from the nominal interaction point , each with a pseudorapidity of 3.1 @xmath20 3.9 .",
    "each mpc compromises 196 ( 220 ) crystal towers , with dimensions of @xmath21@xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "the mpc is capable of identifying neutral pions and eta mesons by reconstruction of their decay photons .",
    "phenix operates within the rhic accelerator , which provides two counter - circulating proton beams at various energies up to @xmath4 = 500 gev .",
    "a feature of rhic is its capability to provide polarized proton beams independently in both directions , allowing for two independent transverse single spin asymmetry measurements by integrating over one beam polarization at a time .",
    "eta mesons are reconstructed and identified in the mpc via the correlation of their decay into two photons .",
    "all pairs of photon candidates are used to form an invariant mass .",
    "real photon pairs originating from @xmath1 ( or @xmath17 ) decays will form a pair - mass close to the mass of the @xmath1 ( or @xmath17 ) .",
    "random combinations ( e.g. using a photon from the wrong @xmath1 or @xmath17 decay or from a mis - identified charged hadron ) form a combinatorial background , uncorrelated to the @xmath1 mass .",
    "figure [ fig : minbias ] ( black curves ) illustrates this for two @xmath24 bins , where these two effects are indistinguishable on an event - by - event basis . to remove the combinatorial background ,",
    "photon candidates are analyzed from different events ( necessarily breaking all real combinations ) to form a mixed event background ( red curves in figure [ fig : minbias ] ) .",
    "subtracting real event and mixed event pairs results in a final @xmath1 mass peak which has little background ( blue curve in figure [ fig : minbias ] ) . an additional correlated background ( in the mass region of 0.2 to 0.4 gev/@xmath25 )",
    "is observed which is related to a jet background ( made up primarily from high energy @xmath26 ) .",
    "this is currently being studied in detail using pythia @xcite simulations .    in order to record the data ,",
    "two triggers are used : a minimum bias ( mb ) trigger which uses the beam - beam counters only , and a high energy cluster ( hec ) trigger in which a @xmath27 tower energy sum ( threshold of @xmath28 = 20 gev ) in the mpc is used to initiate readout of the detector .",
    "the mb trigger allows for an extraction of the @xmath1 meson yield in the region of 1 @xmath29 2 gev/@xmath30 ( see figure [ fig : minbias ] ) .",
    "the hec trigger , accepting only higher energy pairs , reconstruct @xmath1 mesons in the region 2 @xmath29 4 gev/@xmath30 ( see figure [ fig : trig ] ) .",
    "similar to the mb data , there is a @xmath17 dominated jet correlated background that shifts to higher invariant mass as @xmath24 increases .    the @xmath1 meson signal extraction from the mb data for two @xmath24 bins .",
    "the signal ( blue ) is extracted by taking the difference between the real event pairs ( black ) and mixed event pairs ( red ) , which represents the removal of uncorrelated background . ]",
    "the @xmath1 meson signal extracted from the hec data for four @xmath24 bins .",
    "the red bands represent areas where the background asymmetries , @xmath31 , must be calculated and subtracted from the eta peak region , @xmath32 , to get the @xmath1 meson @xmath33 . ]    since the background in both the mb and hec data is expected to be made primarily from @xmath34 , the @xmath1 meson @xmath33 must be corrected for this background .",
    "this is done by calculating the background asymmetry , @xmath31 , and subtracting it from the @xmath1 peak region asymmetry , @xmath32 .",
    "the formula used to obtain @xmath33 is :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the background fraction under the @xmath1 meson peak , and @xmath32 , @xmath31 are calculated from eq .",
    "[ eq : an_equ ] . in 2008 , phenix took 5.2 pb@xmath2 of @xmath18 data at @xmath4 = 200 gev , with an average beam polarization of 45% .",
    "the estimated statistical uncertainty on the @xmath1 meson transverse single spin asymmetry as measured using the mpc is shown in figure [ fig : anerr ] .",
    "estimated statistical uncertainty on @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) is calculable from mb(hec ) mpc data .",
    "@xmath39 will provide a consistency check between the mb and hec data . ]",
    "using the mpc detector in phenix , we have the capability to measure inclusive @xmath1 meson yields at forward rapidity for 1 @xmath29 4 gev/@xmath30 and 0.2 @xmath40 0.7 from @xmath4 = 200 gev @xmath18 collisions .",
    "the versatility of the rhic accelerator having both proton beams polarized , as well as having both a north and south mpc in the phenix detector , provides an excellent basis for consistency checks on the @xmath1 meson transverse single spin asymmetry measurement , which is expected to be finalized in the near future .",
