    "recent x - ray variability studies of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have given us unique insights into the energetics and geometry of the innermost regions of accreting black hole systems . by measuring the phase lags between light curves at different energy bands , we can probe distances as small as tens of lightseconds in agn that are billions of lightyears away .",
    "narrow - line seyfert i galaxy 1h0707 - 495 ( @xmath5 ) was the first agn shown to exhibit reverberation lags @xcite , and since then , this feature has been significantly detected in 15 other seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
    "further evidence for reverberation lags of milliseconds or less have been seen in stellar mass black hole x - ray binary gx  339 - 4 @xcite .",
    "reverberation lags can be explained by the standard reflection model .",
    "matter in a geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disc is accreted onto the black hole , causing the accretion disc to heat up and radiate , mostly in the ultraviolet @xcite .",
    "those thermal disc photons are compton upscattered to x - ray energies in the corona or base of the jet , producing the observed x - ray power - law continuum .",
    "some continuum photons are directed back towards the accretion disc , causing it to fluoresce with the characteristic reflection spectrum .",
    "soft lags or ` reverberation lags ' , where the power - law continuum leads the ` soft excess ' associated with the photoionized disc reflector , are thought to be due to the effect of the light travel time between the corona and the inner accretion disc .",
    "hard lags , where the power - law continuum follows variations at soft energies , have been explained as the propagation of mass accretion rate fluctuations , which modulate regions emitting soft photons before those emitting hard photons @xcite .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ observations of 1h0707 - 495 have been some of the most important resources in gaining an understanding of the x - ray emission from the innermost regions of active galaxies .",
    "the first _ xmm - newton _ observations of 1h0707 - 495 showed a sharp drop in the spectrum at @xmath6  kev @xcite .",
    "two interpretations were developed to explain this feature , namely an absorption edge from a partial covering absorber @xcite , and the edge to the blue wing of a broad iron k@xmath4 line , produced in the inner regions of the disc @xcite .",
    "further observations in 2008 showed more evidence for the inner disc interpretation , as the complementary broad iron l@xmath4 line was also clearly identified @xcite .",
    "in addition to this spectral evidence , timing studies showed a @xmath7 second light travel delay between the power law source and the reflection from the disc .",
    "@xcite interpreted this time delay as being due to scattering in a more distant reflector / absorber associated with a wind directed along the line of sight , though the subsequent x - ray reverberation detections in several different agn make this an unlikely scenario .",
    "see @xcite for further discussion regarding problems with this model .    in 2011 ,",
    "1h0707 - 495 went into a low flux state , which triggered an observation with _ xmm - newton_. the spectral drop associated with the blue wing of the fe k@xmath4 appeared at @xmath8  kev , suggesting emission very close to the central black hole , within 1 @xmath9 of the event horizon @xcite .",
    "lastly , recently public observations from 2010 confirm reflection from a highly ionized disc , and suggest that the reflection spectrum could be slightly modified by a highly ionized outflow @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we compile all the _ xmm - newton _ observations from 2000 to 2010 ( @xmath10  ms ) , to take the closest ever look at the reverberation lags in 1h0707 - 495 . with",
    "@xmath11  2.5 times the dataset , we are better able to define the lag spectrum and structures in the data that were suggested by the analysis of @xcite .",
    "the observations and data reduction are described in section  [ observations ] , and the results are presented in section  [ results ] .",
    "we continue with a study of the robustness of the lag measurement using monte carlo simulations in section [ simulations ] , and discuss our interpretation through a physical model for the lag spectrum in section [ lag_model ] .",
    "1h0707 - 495 has been observed several times over the past 12 years with the _ xmm - newton",
    "_ satellite @xcite .",
    "the 14 observations used in this analysis are shown in table  [ obs ] .",
    "we focus on the data from the epic - pn camera @xcite , which were all made in large window imaging mode , with the exception of the 2000 and 2001 data , which were taken in full window imaging mode .",
    "all the data were reduced in the same way using the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis system ( sas v.11.0.0 ) and the newest calibration files .",
    "the data were cleaned for high background flares , and were selected using the condition pattern @xmath12 .",
    "no significant pile - up was found in any of the observations .",
    ".the 14 _ xmm - newton _ observations used in this analysis , amounting to 1.3  ms of data . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]         the time lag is then calculated in the usual way , with respect to the reference signal from 0.3  0.8  kev .",
    "the top panel in fig .",
    "[ lag_sim ] shows the simulated lag spectrum in the frequency range @xmath13 \\times 10^{-4}$ ]  hz .",
    "notice how the step up from 0 seconds to @xmath11  200 seconds arises naturally due to the time delays between the thermal emission in the disc and the continuum emission in the corona .",
    "this can be easily explained by the fractional contribution of the blackbody and two power - law components in each band compared to the reference .",
    "for instance , at 3  kev , the signal is roughly composed of two parts soft power law ( with lag @xmath14  s ) and one part hard power law ( lag @xmath15  s ) , amounting to an average lag of @xmath16 seconds .",
    "this lag is compared to the reference band , which is roughly composed of 30% blackbody ( lag @xmath17 s ) , 10% hard power law and 50% soft power law , amounting to an average lag of @xmath18  s. the lag at 3  kev , is therefore calculated to be @xmath18  s.    , however , we now account for a faster response from the red wing of the fe k@xmath4 line . in our model",
    ", the red wing of the line responds 15 seconds after the continuum emission , while the bulk of the reflected emission responds 80 seconds after the continuum . ]    the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ lag_sim ] shows the lag in the frequency range @xmath19 \\times 10^{-3}$ ]  hz .",
    "the model follows the general shape of the data , and suggests that reflection is playing a major role in diluting the intrinsic lag of the power law .",
    "however , the model is particularly unsatisfactory in the 34  kev bin . at 34  kev",
    ", the red wing of the iron k@xmath4 line dominates the reflection spectrum .",
    "this is the reflected emission from the innermost regions of the disc , and therefore , it is the signal that responds first . to account for this , we input a time lag of -75  s for the reflection in this bin , which amounts to the reflection lagging behind the power law by just 15 seconds .",
    "therefore , the effect of dilution on the power law due to reflection is less in this band , making the lag appear to be lower .",
    "[ redwing ] shows the results of the simulations with the addition of a fast response from the red wing of the fe k@xmath4 line .",
    "the addition of the response from the red wing significantly improves the fit to the data .",
    "the large positive lag at low frequencies has been explained as the viscous propagation of accretion rate fluctuations in the disc @xcite .",
    "if the energy released from accretion is dissipated in the corona ( e.g. through magnetic field lines ) , fluctuations in the disc could cause correlated variability in the corona .",
    "our analysis of the hard lag spectrum is consistent with this model .",
    "we find zero lags with respect to the reference band ( 0.3  0.8  kev ) at energies below 1  kev ( where the blackbody is appreciable ) , and above 1  kev , where the power law begins to dominate , we compute a lag behind the reference of 200  s up to 600  s. considering the effect of dilution in our simulations , we find that the intrinsic time delays are likely to be greater ( @xmath20  s to @xmath21  s ) .    furthermore , our frequency - resolved analysis of the low frequency lag - energy spectrum ( top panel , fig .",
    "[ lag_spec ] ) , shows that for variations on longer timescales ( ` very - low ' frequencies , @xmath13 \\times 10^{-4}$ ]  hz ) , the blackbody component contributes less .",
    "these very - low frequency variations presumably originate from further regions from the centre , where the temperature of the disc is cooler , and may be out of the spectral sensitivity of _ xmm - newton_. at higher frequencies , ( @xmath22 \\times 10^{-4}$ ]  hz ) , the variations originate closer in , where the disc is hotter , and therefore , the contribution from the blackbody is greater .",
    "our simulations also confirm that if we increase the fractional contribution of the blackbody ( as we expect for smaller radii in a shakura ",
    "sunyaev disc ) , we describe the general shape of the lag - energy spectrum for the ` low ' frequencies in the top panel fig .",
    "[ lag_spec ] .",
    "the low frequency lag spectrum shows a steady increase above 1 kev .",
    "this upward trend has been observed in stellar mass black holes , such as cyg x-1 @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that these lags could be due to radial dependence of the spectral index , in which it is hardest in the innermost regions , and becomes softer at further distances .",
    "perturbations in the accretion flow that are introduced at different radii ( and therefore different timescales ) propagate inward on diffusion timescales , which cause the observed power law shape of the lag spectrum . this model for galactic black holes",
    "can also explain the upward trend seen in the lag spectrum of 1h0707 - 495 .",
    "the data are well described by our simulations , which follow the kotov model of the soft power law responding first followed by the hard power law from the innermost regions .",
    "finally , this interpretation of an extended corona is consistent with relativistic models by @xcite that show that a majority of the power law comes from a small region within 5 @xmath9 , while the rest comes from further out .",
    "the negative lags at high frequencies have been explained as the light travel time between continuum emission produced in the corona and reflected emission from the inner regions of the disc . the soft lag spectrum in bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ lag_spec]b is generally consistent with this model in that variations at energies dominated by the reflection spectrum are temporally coincident with those of the reference band , while the energies dominated by the power - law component lead those variations .",
    "this result is consistent with previous results , and now with the new long dataset , we are able to define the lag spectrum much more clearly , revealing structure at the fe k@xmath4 line .    an important result from the simulations in fig .",
    "[ lag_sim ] is to show that the actual time delays between the power law emission and the reflection are not necessarily the same as the lags we measure because of the effect of dilution .",
    "we find that for much of the reflection , the actual light travel lag is more on the order of 80 seconds , corresponding to a coronal height of @xmath23 @xmath9 ( assuming a black hole mass @xmath24 ) . at 3  4  kev , the red wing of the iron k@xmath4 line , we find that the light travel time is @xmath25 seconds , corresponding to emission from within 1 @xmath9 of the event horizon .",
    "future work using realistic transfer functions , which take into account the spatial extent of the source and the inclination of the disc , will improve our soft lag spectral models , and give us a better understanding of the geometry of the innermost regions closest to the black hole .",
    "we have presented the timing analysis of 1h0707 - 495 using 1.3  ms of data taken over 10 years with _ xmm - newton_. we have simulated the lag spectra using a model that accounts for dilution from different spectral components in calculating the lag . this simple model for the hard and soft lag",
    "spectra shows complicated features that can be explained by reflection .",
    "we have also shown through an analysis of the covariance spectrum and the time - integrated spectrum , that there is evidence for a more complicated continuum emitting region , which produces a harder power law closer to the centre , and a softer power law at larger radii .",
    "further work needs to be done to understand the complexities of the power law emitting region .",
    "this , and future work with more realistic transfer functions for the response of the accretion disc will be beneficial in uncovering the precise origin of the x - ray emission in the local environments of supermassive black holes .",
