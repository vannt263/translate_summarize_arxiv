    "in the present paper , we study the propagation of internal waves in a two - fluid system , which consists in two layers of immiscible fluids of different densities , under the only influence of gravity .",
    "the domain of the two layers is infinite in the horizontal space variable ( assumed to be of dimension @xmath0 ) and delimited above by a flat , rigid lid , a below by a flat bottom .",
    "moreover , we assume that the fluids are homogeneous , ideal , incompressible and irrotational .",
    "we let the reader refer to  @xcite , and references therein , for a good overview of the ins and outs concerning density - stratified fluids in oceanography , and the relevance of our setup as a model for such system .",
    "the governing equations describing the evolution of the flow under the aforementioned configuration may be reduced to a system of two evolution equations located at the interface between the two layers ( following a strategy initiated in the water - wave configuration in  @xcite , and achieved in the bi - fluidic case in  @xcite ) , named _",
    "full euler system_. however , the study of this system is extremely challenging .",
    "in particular , the well - posedness of the cauchy problem has been answered satisfactorily ( that is , with an existence of solutions on a time scale consistent with physical observations ) only recently ; see  @xcite .    under these circumstances ,",
    "a great deal of interests has been drawn to _ asymptotic models _ , in order to predict accurately the main behavior of the system , provided some parameters describing the domain and nature of the flow are small .",
    "parameters of interests include @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the maximal vertical deformation of the interface with respect to its rest position ; @xmath3 is a characteristic horizontal length ; @xmath4 ( resp .",
    "@xmath5 ) is the depth of the upper ( resp .",
    "lower ) layer ; and @xmath6 ( resp .",
    "@xmath7 ) is the density of the upper ( resp .",
    "lower ) layer , @xmath8 the gravitational acceleration and @xmath9 the interfacial tension coefficient .",
    "mathematically speaking , @xmath10 and @xmath11 measure respectively the amount of dispersion and nonlinearity which will contribute to the evolution of internal waves , and @xmath12 ( the bond number ) expresses the ratio of surface tension forces to gravitational forces",
    ". it would be quite tedious to make an attempt at acknowledging every work on this aspect , but let us introduce some earlier results directly related to the present paper .",
    "shallow water ( @xmath13 ) asymptotic models for uni - dimensional internal waves have been derived and studied in the pioneer works of  @xcite .",
    "more recently , choi and camassa developed models with weakly ( @xmath14 ) and strongly ( @xmath15 ) nonlinear terms , respectively in  @xcite with horizontal dimension @xmath16 .",
    "they obtain bi - fluidic extensions of the classical shallow water ( or saint - venant  @xcite ) , boussinesq  @xcite and green - naghdi  @xcite models .",
    "similar systems have been derived in  @xcite ( with the additional assumption of @xmath17 ) and in  @xcite ( using a different approach , _",
    "i.e. _ making use of the hamiltonian structure of the full euler equations ) .",
    "however , the aforementioned results are limited to the formal level .",
    "let us mention now the work of bona , lannes and saut  @xcite who , following a strategy initiated in  @xcite in the water - wave setting ( one layer of fluid , with free surface ) , derived a large class of models for different regimes , under the rigid - lid assumption , neglecting surface tension effects and with flat bottom ( see also  @xcite where a topography and surface tension is added to the system , and  @xcite where the rigid - lid assumption is removed ) .",
    "the models derived in these papers are systematically justified by a consistency result : roughly speaking , sufficiently smooth solutions of the full euler system satisfy the equations of the asymptotic model , up to a small remainder .    yet",
    "the consistency is only one of the properties that an asymptotic model shall satisfy , for its validity to be ascertained .",
    "indeed , it leaves two important questions unanswered : for a large class of initial data ( typically bounded in suitable sobolev spaces )    * _ ( well - posedness ) _ do the full euler system , as well as the asymptotic model , define a unique solution on a relevant time scale ? * _ ( convergence ) _ is the difference between these two solutions small over the relevant time scale ?    as mentioned earlier , lannes has recently proved  @xcite that the cauchy problem for bi - fluidic full euler system is well - posed in sobolev spaces , in the presence of a small amount of surface tension .",
    "thus the full justification of a consistent system of equation as an asymptotic model , in the sense described above , follows from its well - posedness and a stability result ; see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix  c ) for a detailed discussion and state of the art in the water - wave setting .",
    "a striking discrepancy between the water - wave and the bi - fluidic setting is that in the latter , large amplitude internal waves are known to generate kelvin - helmholtz instabilities , so that surface tension is necessary in order to regularize the flow . a crucial contribution of  @xcite consists in asserting that `` the kelvin - helmholtz instabilities appear above a frequency threshold for which surface tension is relevant , while the main ( observable ) part of the wave involves low frequencies located below this frequency threshold '' .",
    "it is therefore expected that the surface tension does not play an essential role in the dominant evolution of the flow , especially in the shallow water regime .",
    "this intuition is confirmed by the fact that well - posedness and stability results have been proved for the bi - fluidic shallow - water system  @xcite , and a class of boussinesq - type systems  @xcite , without surface tension and under reasonable assumptions on the flow ( typically , the shear velocity must be sufficiently small ) .",
    "however , the original bi - fluidic green - naghdi model is known to be unconditionally ill - posed  @xcite , which has led to various propositions in order to overcome this difficulty ; see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "let us recall here that green - naghdi models consist in higher order extensions of the shallow water equation , thus are consistent with precision @xmath18 instead of @xmath19 , and allow strong nonlinearities ( whereas boussinesq models are limited to the long wave regime : @xmath14 ) . finally , we mention the work of xu  @xcite , which studies and rigorously justifies the so - called intermediate long wave system , obtained in a regime similar to ours : @xmath20 , but @xmath21 .    _ in this work , we present a new green - naghdi type model in the camassa - holm ( or medium amplitude ) regime , @xmath22 , for the propagation of internal waves .",
    "_ more precisely , the regime of validity of our model is , with fixed @xmath23 : @xmath24 our model is fully justified : we prove that the full euler system is consistent with our model , and that our system is well - posed ( in the sense of hadamard ) in sobolev spaces , and stable with respect to perturbations of the equations .",
    "these results hold identically without or with ( small ) surface tension .",
    "let us emphasize that in addition to its relevance as an asymptotic model , our system offers an important tool for the justification of other models .",
    "indeed , it suffices to check that a given approximate solution solves our system up to a small remainder , to ensure that it is truly close to the solution of our new model , and therefore to the corresponding solution of the full euler system .",
    "such strategy has been used in particular in  @xcite in order to rigorously justify the historical korteweg - de vries equation as a model for the propagation of surface wave in the long wave regime ( with a boussinesq model as the intermediary system ) ; and this result has been extended to the bi - fluidic case in  @xcite .",
    "higher order models in the camassa - holm regime have been introduced and justified in the sense of consistency in  @xcite in the water - wave case , and in  @xcite in the bi - fluidic case .",
    "we are therefore able to fully justify the latter model , in the sense described above .",

    "altogether , the governing equations of our problem are given by the following @xmath100 where @xmath101 denotes the unit upward normal vector at the interface .",
