    "transition metal oxides show remarkable physical properties , such as colossal magnetoresistance in manganites@xcite , or superconductivity in cuprates@xcite , which after decades of researches , remain only partly understood .",
    "this reflects our understanding of the structural , electronic and magnetic phenomena , which is well established only in the limit where the systems show localized or itinerant electron behavior@xcite .",
    "doping with electrons or holes is the canonical method to explore the intermediate regime .",
    "for example , in r@xmath8d@xmath9mno@xmath0  manganese perovskites ( r : trivalent cation , d : divalent cation ) , the mn valence is formally intermediate 3+x , affecting the electrical conductivity and leading to a complex phase diagram",
    ".    however , even undoped compounds display an intriguing evolution of their magnetic properties as the geometry and coordination are changed .",
    "for example , in the rmno@xmath0 and dmno@xmath0 end members of the r@xmath8d@xmath9mno@xmath0  series , mn has undoubtedly well localized electrons , making these compounds prototype antiferromagnetic ( af ) mott insulators .",
    "their magnetic properties fit a heisenberg picture , in which superexchange ( se ) interactions couple high spin mn@xmath10@xmath11 and mn@xmath12@xmath13 ions at @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively@xcite .",
    "this can be contrasted to the very unusual magnetic properties of some hexagonal manganese halides containing single valent mn ions .",
    "csmnbr@xmath0@xcite and csmni@xmath0@xcite compounds containing s=5/2 high spin mn@xmath6 ions arranged in infinite strings of face - sharing mno@xmath5  octahedra parallel to the c axis , from which exchange frustration is expected between the direct and the super - exchange interactions of different sign within the chains .",
    "exchange frustration in the basal plane also bring about chirality of the magnetic state and a spin dynamic corresponding to new universality classes@xcite .",
    "one may be tempted to conclude that these unusual magnetic properties arise from the quasi one - dimensional nature of the exchange , combined with easy axis anisotropy .",
    "however , isostructural bamno@xmath0 ( s=3/2 ) does not show such effects , but it has instead a simple antiferromagnetic structure and rather classical magnetic behavior with the ordered moment value saturating at low temperatures@xcite .    in order to separate the influence upon the magnetic properties of the lattice geometry from more conventional chemical effects , the study of polymorphic compounds , which display different stable or metastable structures with the same chemical composition is particularly valuable . as discussed by nagas and roth@xcite ,",
    "the stability of the structures adopted by @xmath16 compounds depends on the tolerance factor @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the average ionic radius of the a - site cations , while @xmath19and @xmath20 are those of the b - site metal and of the anion ( oxygen , halogen or chalcogen ) .",
    "most manganites have @xmath21 , and crystallize in orthorhombic or rhombohedral perovskite structures showing cooperative tilting of the corner sharing mno@xmath5  array , with respect to the ideal cubic perovskite . for sufficiently large @xmath18 ,",
    "@xmath22 materials adopt a different hexagonal symmetry , as in the case of bamno@xmath0 and the aforementioned halides . for @xmath23 ,",
    "polytypes are obtained depending on the synthesis procedure@xcite .",
    "these polytypes are characterized by the stacking sequence of the ao@xmath0 layers , which controls how the mno@xmath5  octahedra arrange .",
    "octahedra are sharing corners across the central ao@xmath0 layer of _ .. abc .. _ sequences , while they share faces across _ .. aba .. _ type sequences .",
    "for example , synthesized at ambient pressure in air , srmno@xmath0(@xmath24 ) has a four layer ( 4l ) _ abac _ stacking sequence of sro@xmath0 layers as shown in fig.[magtopo ] , whereas modified synthesis routines are required to obtain the cubic perovskite@xcite .",
    "4l is a rather rare polytype among abx@xmath0 compounds , and represents an intermediate case between the hexagonal ( 2l ) polytype adopted by bamno@xmath0 , and the familiar perovskite structure of camno@xmath0 containing only corner sharing octahedra .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study the magnetism in srmno@xmath0 in comparison with that of the perovkite and 2l hexagonal materials .",
    "this could also help to shed light on the striking differences of magnetic behavior in isostructural csmnbr@xmath0 and bamno@xmath0 . in srmno@xmath0 ,",
    "a complex magnetic behavior is expected from the exchange topology , which results from the arrangement of pairs of face sharing mno@xmath5  linked connected by the octahedra corners . in this structure , direct mn - mn exchange interactions between mn@xmath12ions in face sharing octahedra ( @xmath25 ) compete with the @xmath26 af - se linkages through the face shared by mno@xmath5  octahedra ( @xmath27 ) as in bamno@xmath0 , and @xmath28 af - se linkages across the common oxygen of corner sharing mno@xmath5  octahedra ( @xmath29 ) , like in camno@xmath0 . as in several hexagonal transition metal oxides or sulfides ,",

    "af order sets in only at lower temperatures , where zero field cooled and field cooled @xmath31 curves deviate ( @xmath32@xmath33)@xcite . recently , raman spectroscopy was used to evidence a structural transformation in srmno@xmath0  below @xmath34@xcite . to explain the subtle difference observed by raman spectroscopy , the authors proposed a 4l to 6l transition , allowing the hexagonal symmetry to be retained .    in this article",
    ", we present a complete study of the magnetic and structural properties of srmno@xmath0 , using in combination electron microscopy , neutron powder diffraction ( npd ) and high - resolution synchtrotron x - ray powder diffraction ( hr - sxpd ) .",
    "polycristalline samples of srmno@xmath0  were synthesized by solid - state reaction in air of a stoichiometric mixture ( 1:0.5 ) of srco@xmath0 and mn@xmath35o@xmath0 .",
    "the powder was heated at 950@xmath36c during two weeks with intermediate grindings , then pelletized and sintered at 1000@xmath36c for 12 hrs .",
    "this low - temperature synthesis was determined from the phase diagrams @xcite as the best route to obtain pure hexagonal 4l - structure without oxygen deficiency .",
    "samples quality and stoichiometry were determined by preliminary neutron diffraction measurements .    at room temperature ,",
    "the reconstruction of the reciprocal space was carried out with a jeol 200 cx electron microscope and high resolution electron microscopy ( hrem ) images at room temperature were recorded using a topcon 002b microscope ( cs = 0.4mmm ) .",
    "the electron diffraction patterns versus temperature were collected with a jeol 2010 electron microscope operating at 200kv and equipped with a double - tilt liquid n2 sample holder ( tilt @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 ) .",
    "all the patterns were recorded under the same experimental conditions , i.e. the same exposure time , the same electron beam alignment and the same beam intensity and increasing the temperature from @xmath40 to @xmath41 , in steps of @xmath42 degrees , waiting for temperature stabilization before recording .",
    "the three microscopes are equipped with energy dispersive analysis spectrometers ( eds ) , which allow determining the sr / mn ratio .",
    "magnetic susceptibility was collected under a magnetic field of 1000 oe under zero - field cooled ( zfc ) and field cooled ( fc ) processes .",
    "data were collected on warming between 2k and 400k at a sweep rate of 1k / min , using a vibrating sample magnetometer ( quantum design , ppms ) .",
    "high resolution synchrotron and time - of - flight neutron powder diffraction data were collected at 100 and 350k , using the id31 beam line at the esrf , grenoble with a wavelength @xmath43 , and hrpd at the isis facility ( uk ) , respectively .",
    "subsequent medium - resolution neutron diffraction data were collected on the general materials ( gem ) diffractometer of the isis facility to study the temperature dependence of the crystal structure and the magnetic structure .",
    "data sets at temperature between @xmath44 and @xmath41 with @xmath45 steps were collected on warming using a standard he cryostat .",
    "the diffraction patterns were used to refine the srmno@xmath0  structure by the rietveld method@xcite using the fullprof suite ( ref . ) .",
    "symmetry analysis for the structural and magnetic phase transitions was performed using the basireps program , part of the fullprof suite as well as programs available on the bilbao crystallographic server @xcite .",
    "the dc magnetic susceptibility of srmno@xmath0  between 2 and 400k is reported in fig.2 .",
    "plot of the inverse suceptibility , not shown , indicates that a curie - weiss behavior is not obeyed in this temperature range , in agreement with earlier results @xcite .",
    "however , our results below 400k are qualitatively different to what was previously reported .",
    "below 380k , there is a clear upturn in the susceptibility followed by a relatively shallow decrease below 300k .",
    "the upturn could be associated with the structural phase transition reported herein , and discussed in the following sections , as evidenced by x - ray and neutron diffraction .",
    "however , it was impossible to track precisely the structural details as a function of temperature due to the extremely weak intensities of the superlattice reflections and therefore confirm unambiguously the correlation between structural and magnetic behaviors .",
    "also , this upturn could be associated to short - range magnetic correlations within the face - sharing mno@xmath5 octahedra , as suggested by battle et al.@xcite . + at lower temperatures ( t@xmath46300k ) where @xmath47 decreases , the behavior is clearly reminiscent of antiferromagnets .",
    "this is in agreement with previous work , in particular with the largely negative weiss temperature of -1210k derived by susceptibility measurements at high temperature@xcite .",
    "the determination of the nel temperature from susceptibility alone is not straightforward due to the broad maximum observed in the variation of @xmath47 .",
    "battle and co - workers identified a nel temperature of 278k from mossbauer spectroscopy on fe - doped samples@xcite .",
    "our measurements suggest the same nel transition temperature since the susceptibility curves in field cooled ( fc ) and zero - field cooled ( zfc ) conditions slightly deviates at around 280k . moreover , this accident coincides with the onset of a long - range ordered antiferromagnetic structure evidenced by our neutron diffraction experiment , as discussed below .      in this section ,",
    "we report a detailed crystallographic characterization of srmno@xmath0  from electron microscopy and high - resolution x - ray and neutron powder diffraction experiments .",
    "a large number of crystallites have been analyzed by eds and electron diffraction , confirming an homogeneous sr / mn ratio = 1 in the limit of the accuracy of the technique .",
    "the reconstruction of the reciprocal space was carried out by tilting the sample around the crystallographic axes .",
    "it evidences an hexagonal cell with @xmath48 ( @xmath49 is the parameter of the ideal cubic perovskite cell ) , @xmath50 and the extinction condition _",
    "hh2@xmath51l = 2n_.",
    "these results are consistent with the 4l polytype proposed for srmno@xmath0  as well as the space group @xmath1 previously reported@xcite .",
    "the @xmath52 $ ] ed pattern at room temperature is given in fig.[tem1]a .",
    "the quality of the crystallites was checked using hrem , in order to detect the presence of any intergrowth defects ( variations in the layer stacking along @xmath53 , i.e. the presence of different polytypes ) .",
    "the lattice images , not shown , confirm that the stacking of the 4l structure is quite perfect .",
    "the density of defects is very low ( of the order a few events for a nanometer - sized crystallite ) , which is rather rare in the hexagonal polytypes , allowing one to conclude that these defect do not significantly affect the symmetry .",
    "+ the reciprocal space was reconstructed at @xmath40 , tilting especially around the @xmath54 axis .",
    "one clearly observes two important points : first , the lattice parameters remains unchanged , especially @xmath55 , attesting that the 4l stacking mode is retained and second , the appearance of another system of weak reflections , _",
    "l = no condition _ , which clearly violate the mirror @xmath56 symmetry .",
    "this is illustrated comparing fig.[tem1]a and [ tem1]b with the evolution of the @xmath52 $ ] ed pattern between rt and @xmath57 . at this step",
    ", a careful rotation around @xmath54 , selecting the @xmath58 $ ] ed patterns with large @xmath59 and @xmath60 values , shows that , in our conditions of reflection , the bragg peaks _ 00l : l=2n+1 _ are scarcely visible but not null .",
    "increasing @xmath61 , step by step , up to room temperature shows that the intensity of the extra reflections remain unchanged between @xmath40 and @xmath34 , it decreases from @xmath34 to @xmath62 and ,",
    "lastly , disappears for @xmath63 when keeping our working conditions constant .",
    "this transition temperature is probably an underestimate , due to the heating of the sample under electron beam irradiation .      in agreement with the tem results , high resolution x - ray and neutron powder diffraction",
    "indicate that a number of ( hkl ) bragg reflections with odd l index appear at low temperature . in the synchrotron x - ray diffraction pattern at 100k ,",
    "the strongest of these additional peaks is ( 221 ) whereas in the neutron data , two reflections indexed ( 221 ) and ( 223 ) in the hexagonal setting are the most clearly visible .",
    "the fact that these additional reflections appear at high value of the scattering vector ( q ) and are present in the x - ray data , indicate their nuclear origin . at 350k ,",
    "the reflections are almost extinct but a close inspection of the diffraction pattern reveal a weak contribution even at this temperature .",
    "nevertheless , their intensities at 350k are too weak to determine the change of structure . in this respect , the model of battle et al . , with hexagonal symmetry",
    "p6@xmath0/mmc , remains a valid approximation at high temperature .",
    "the extracted parameters from the combined refinement of x - ray and neutron data at 350k , assuming p6@xmath0/mmc symmetry , are reported in table [ tablecombi ] .",
    "+ at low temperature , this model is obviously invalid due to the presence of new reflections .",
    "also , our preliminary study with medium resolution neutron diffraction as a function of temperature , indicates that the thermal parameter of some atoms , in particular , o(1 ) , increases when the temperature is lowered , suggesting that p6@xmath0/mmc is a pseudo - symmetry . in agreement with our tem results , npd and hr - sxpd data",
    "are consistent with the absence of the _ c _ glide - plane symmetry operation .",
    "none of the maximal isotropy subgroups of order 2 , as listed in the international tables of crystallography@xcite , is able to fit the data .",
    "the solution was found among isotropy subgroups of higher index , which are compatible with the landau and lifshitz conditions of the theory of second order phase transitions , as listed by hatch and stokes@xcite or equivalently , by the program isotropy@xcite .",
    "the only solution fitting the data corresponds to the orthorhombic space group @xmath2 with a super - cell related to the hexagonal cell in the following way : @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "this phase transition is a perfect example of pseudo - symmetry problems since there are no direct indication of the orthorhombic symmetry from splitting of equivalent reflections or anisotropic broadening .",
    "the system remains metrically hexagonal within the very high resolution of our x - ray and neutron experiments ; therefore in - plane lattice parameters were constrained accordingly in the refinements .",
    "this also indicate that the atomic displacements involved must be small enough to remain decoupled from the lattice strain .",
    "+ in the low - temperature structure , the atomic positions for all atoms , with the exception of the mn site , split into two orbits . in our model , all refinable atomic positions were allowed to vary , while thermal parameters of atoms belonging to the two related orbits were constrained to be equal .",
    "the combined x - ray and neutron rietveld refinement , presented in fig.[combi ] , is in excellent agreement with the data .",
    "reliability factors of the refinement and refined structural parameters are listed in table [ tablecombi ] .",
    "it is important to note that the combined refinement is of crucial importance here because the difference in contrast in the x - ray and neutron experiments ( o is a strong neutron scatterer , mn neutron scattering length is negative ) is extremely selective .",
    "+ the nature of the phase transition , involving all ions in the crystal , is difficult to comprehend without decomposing the respective atomic displacements .",
    "we have used group theory , to explain in details the symmetry descent across the phase transition .",
    "the atomic displacements , shown in fig . [ modes ] , are decomposed in symmetry - adapted modes of the irreducible representation @xmath69 corresponding to the observed symmetry descent . more details about the treatment with representation theory are given in appendix [ sa ] , and the basis vectors of these modes are reported in tables [ bsf ] . figs.[modes]a and [ modes]b represent individual modes while fig.[modes]c shows the resulting displacements consistent with the final refinement of atomic positions .",
    "the transition involves a slight tilting of the corner - sharing mn@xmath3o@xmath4 units composed of 2 face - sharing mno@xmath5 octahedra .",
    "this is coupled to a shear motion of sr@xmath6 cations in the _ ab_-plane .",
    "it is clear that the largest displacements are associated with the o(1 ) ions which explain our preliminary results of large thermal displacements on this site in the hexagonal setting .",
    "the sequential refinements of gem data ( @xmath70 ) do not show any obvious discontinuity for most of the geometrical parameters of the structure : excepted for volume contraction , the mn - o bond distances and angles within the mn@xmath3o@xmath4 units are temperature independent .",
    "the structural transition essentially manifests in the temperature dependance of some of the mn - o - mn angles across corner sharing octahedra , which very slightly reduce by @xmath71 in the low temperature phase .",
    "the raman data@xcite must therefore be reinterpreted in the light of the rather subtle transition we have established .    *",

    "these reflections are clearly magnetic in origin since their intensities decrease rapidly as a function of the scattering vector q , following the magnetic form factor .",
    "we note that magnetic scattering and nuclear scattering attributable to the structural phase transition give rise to different contributions in the diffraction pattern , allowing to treat both problems separately .",

    "these modes give the same arrangement of spins with components along the _ a_- and _ b_-directions respectively and are in fact equivalent due to the hexagonal pseudo - symmetry .",
    "in fact , these modes belong to a single irreducible representation when the analysis is performed in the hexagonal setting .",
    "for the same reason , it is impossible to determine the direction of the spins in the _ ab_-plane , and we have arbitrarily chosen to direct them along the _ a_-axis .",
    "the refinement , shown in fig.[gemmag ] , is of very good quality .",
    "the global user - weigthed @xmath89 , and the bragg r - factors for each pattern are @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 for the patterns collected on the @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 detectors banks , respectively . the magnetic structure is reported in fig.[mag ] .",
    "it can be described as a simple antiferromagnetic structure since the magnetic moments of all first neighbor mn ions are aligned antiparallel .",
    "the most surprising finding is the value of the manganese magnetic moment extracted from our rietveld refinements as a function of temperature , as shown in fig.[gemmag ] . for a quenched orbital contribution ,",
    "the expected ordered moment for high spin mn@xmath12  ions is 3 @xmath99 per mn ion but the observed value , saturating at 2.27(1 ) at low temperature , is significantly reduced .",
    "the nature of the structural phase transition and in particular its connection with the magnetic properties , are not immediately clear . the transition does not manifest as an abrupt decrease of the interatomic mn - mn distance , so that it can not be obviously related to some magnetic exchange - striction , which could strengthen direct antiferromagnetic interactions over the superexchange interactions . in the measured temperature range ,",
    "the mn - mn distance decreases smoothly ( @xmath100=2.485(2 ) at 100k and 2.497(3 ) at 350k ) following essentially the expected thermal expansion .",
    "data collected on a finer temperature scale would be needed to exclude completely the presence of exchange striction in this material .    even though it has not been precisely determined here , the structural phase transition temperature is certainly above 350k and it probably coincides with the changes observed in magnetization at @xmath101380k .",
    "therefore , it has clearly no connection with the onset of magnetic order at @xmath102286k .",
    "in fact , preliminary neutron measurements show that the structural transition temperature increases when ca is substituted for sr in the system , highlighting the critical role of ionic radius on the a - site . from this",
    ", we conclude that the transition is primarily due to a steric effect .",
    "this probably influences indirectly the magnetic properties as follows .",
    "the distortion induces a small bending of the mn - o - mn angle between some corner sharing octahedra , which could reduce the electron transfer of the 3d electron between mn pairs .",
    "this can accordingly enhance correlations associated to the direct exchange interactions inside each pair below @xmath103 , before the magnetic ordering is established below @xmath32=286k .",
    "let s come back first to the exchange topology of srmno@xmath0 , as introduced in fig.[magtopo ] .",
    "it is clear that for the superexchange path @xmath29 , the nearly 180@xmath36 mn - o - mn bond angle between corner - sharing mno@xmath5 octahedra favors antiferromagnetic arrangement according to the goodenough - kanamori - anderson ( gka ) rules@xcite .",
    "however , gka rules predict a ferromagnetic superexchange interaction for the path @xmath27 between mn spins of face - sharing octahedra , since here , the mn - o - mn angle is nearly 90@xmath36 .",
    "the observed antiferromagnetic arrangement between these mn ions indicates that the exchange @xmath25 through direct overlap of d orbitals , dominates over super - exchange interactions .",
    "the sign of the direct exchange interaction depends on the interatomic distance between mn ions , with shorter bonds favoring an antiferromagnetic arrangement .",
    "the effect of interatomic distances has been systematically studied in mn intermetallic compounds . in r(mn ,",
    "fe)@xmath5a ( r : rare earth , a : sn or ge ) , a crossover from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic interactions was clearly observed for distances below 2.61 @xcite , whereas in various solid solutions derived from mnsb , that crossover is found for average mn - mn distances below 2.83@xcite .",
    "a strong antiferromagnetic direct interaction arising from the small value of @xmath104 reported here for the mn - mn distance in srmno@xmath0  is perfectly consistent with the trend seen in intermetallic compounds .",
    "let us compare now the properties of the present pure , defect free and stoichiometric srmno@xmath0 , with that of bamno@xmath0 and camno@xmath0 keeping in mind that most camno@xmath0 compounds are oxygen deficient .",
    "bamno@xmath0@xcite and camno@xmath0@xcite have also simple magnetic structures with af arrangements of nearest neighbor mn .",
    "the ordered moment reported for bamno@xmath0 and that extrapolated for stoichiometric camno@xmath0 , fits the expected gs=3@xmath99 value for high spin mn@xmath12  ions .",
    "this is not surprising considering camno@xmath0 as a classical example of heisenberg magnet with se interactions . in the case of bamno@xmath0 ,",
    "the magnetic ordering shows a very classical behavior , which probably results from the fact that the mn - mn distance is shorter ( @xmath105 ) than in srmno@xmath0 .",
    "the enhancement of direct antiferromagnetic exchange interaction in such case can explain why the moment saturates in bamno@xmath0 and not in srmno@xmath0 , despite the quasi - one dimensional effects expected from the infinite strings of face sharing octahedra in bamno@xmath0 .    from the presented data and the comparison with other materials",
    ", we therefore suggest that the heisenberg / se picture does not fully hold in srmno@xmath0 , and that this results from an enhanced competition between se and direct exchange interactions between neighboring mn atoms in face sharing octahedra . instead of isolated high spin mn@xmath12  ions ,",
    "the proper magnetic unit should rather be considered as mn@xmath35o@xmath106 pairs .",
    "the loss of the mn@xmath12  ion identity is reminiscent to the loss of v@xmath10 ion identity which has been discussed in the case of the prototype v@xmath35o@xmath0 system@xcite . like srmno@xmath0",
    ", v@xmath35o@xmath0 shows pairs of face sharing vo@xmath5 octahedra interconnected by the edges in the corrundum structure . here",
    "also , it has been concluded that the localized - electron unit in the antiferromagnetic insulating ground state may be the nearest - neighbor pairs , with the electrons delocalized within a pair , which has been later thoroughly confirmed by theoretical investigation of effective spin / orbital hamiltonians@xcite .",
    "the reduced moment in srmno@xmath0  at low temperatures indicates that something similar happens within the mn - mn dimers of srmno@xmath0 .",
    "in summary , we have shown that a structural transition does take place in srmno@xmath0 , but that this occurs at much higher temperature than previously reported from raman scattering@xcite , and is probably correlated with the transition observed in magnetization at @xmath107 .",
    "the structural transformation does not correspond to a change of polytype , but to a subtle distortion within the 4l structure lowering the hexagonal @xmath1 symmetry to a @xmath2 orthorhombic pseudo - symmetry , which preserves the hexagonal metrics .",
    "this structural transition seems to be primarily due to steric effects , which only indirectly affects magnetic exchange .",
    "npd reveals that srmno@xmath0   has a reduced moment at low temperatures .",
    "we interpret this might be due to the presence of delocalized electrons within mn@xmath35o@xmath106 pairs , a finding that deserves confirmation from theoretical studies of the electronic structure .",

    "however , the program outputs 8 real one - dimensional representations , and 4 two - dimensional complex representations .",

    "representation analysis is more general , and also applies to other type of phase transitions where atoms acquire a new scalar , vectorial , or tensorial property in the low - symmetry phase . instead of dealing with atomic displacements ( polar vectors ) in the case of structural transitions",
    ", we can indeed deal with the appearance of a magnetic moment to treat the case of magnetic transitions : @xmath135 the only change in the orthogonalization procedure and the construction of the sbf summarizing this time the symmetry relation of the fourier components @xmath136 , is the action of the space group operation @xmath117 in eq.[proj ] , which is different for axial and polar vectors .",
