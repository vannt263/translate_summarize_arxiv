    "an accurate knowledge of @xmath0 and log @xmath1 allows us to deduce many aspects of a white dwarf s evolution .",
    "currently , the best way of determining both of these quantities is by fitting a calculated model atmosphere to either the hydrogen lyman or balmer line absorption series @xcite .",
    "this is not without it s drawbacks , however , as the shape of the lyman / balmer absorption features is also dependent upon the metal species present in the atmosphere .",
    "therefore , inaccurate atomic data used to calculate model atmospheres may also result in an inaccurate determination of the @xmath0 and log @xmath1 . current calculations of lyman / balmer line profiles also utilise pre - calculated stark broadening tables to reduce calculation time . as with the atomic data ,",
    "if the broadening tables are not accurate enough , then this will also propagate errors to the determined @xmath0 and log @xmath1 .",
    "in an analysis by @xcite , the authors measured @xmath0 and log @xmath1 for a sample of da white dwarfs that had data in the lyman / balmer line regions from orfeus , hut , and the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) in the uv , and ground based telescopes in the optical .",
    "it was shown that the @xmath0 determined from the lyman / balmer line series disgreed for several white dwarfs , however , this was regarded as being due to systematics present in the observational data .",
    "an improved study by @xcite considered a larger data set where all uv data originated from fuse . a uniform pipeline was developed and applied to the uv data in an attempt to reduce any systematics present .",
    "the determined lyman / balmer @xmath0 up to @xmath250,000k was found to be in agreement for both series , however , a statistically significant discrepancy became apparent for stars with @xmath0 greater than this .",
    "this discrepancy has affectionately been dubbed `` the lyman / balmer line problem '' .    in this proceeding , we present preliminary results from our study of the lyman / balmer line problem in hot da white dwarfs .",
    "we approach the problem from three perspectives .",
    "the first is the opacity used to calculate model atmospheres .",
    "this involves using atomic data from the @xcite ( ku92 hereafter ) and the @xcite ( ku11 hereafter ) data releases .",
    "the ku92 release contains @xmath3 and @xmath4 fe / ni iv - vi transitions respectively . the second is the broadening tables used to synthesise the lyman / balmer line profiles .",
    "two of these tables are investigated , one calculated by @xcite , and another from @xcite .",
    "the third is the composition of the atmosphere .",
    "we calculate model atmospheres with a pure hydrogen composition , and a metal polluted composition .",
    "seven white dwarfs are chosen that have been observed both in the uv and optical wavebands .",
    "all of these bar wd1254 + 233 ( gd153 ) are thought to be polluted with metals .",
    "two of these stars , namely wd0501 + 527 ( g191-b2b ) , and wd1254 + 233 , are calibration standards @xcite and have well measured @xmath0 .",
    "the remaining five , wd0229 - 481 , wd0556 - 375 , wd0621 - 376 , wd1738 + 669 , and wd2211 - 495 have been observed to have @xmath0 @xmath5k , and have exhibited the lyman / balmer problem .",
    "the uv data for each of these stars is taken from fuse observations . where possible , fuse datasets taken using the lwrs aperture are used as flux losses due to source drift are minimised .",
    "stars with multiple datasets are coadded to improve the signal to noise .",
    "the full list of datasets used in this analysis will be included in a future publication .",
    "optical observations are taken from several sources . in the case of wd0501 + 527 and wd1254 + 233 ,",
    "coadded g430l observations from the space telescope imaging spectrometer ( stis ) aboard the hubble space telescope are used . for the remaining five stars , objects with declinations @xmath6",
    "were observed by the steward observatory , while objects with declinations @xmath7 were observed by the south african astronomical observatory .",
    "full details on the optical observations are given in @xcite .",
    "model atmospheres used in this study are calculated using tlusty @xcite version 201 , and are synthesised with synspec version 49 @xcite .",
    "each grid is calculated with @xmath0 ranging from 35,000 to 100,000k in steps of 2,500k , and log @xmath1 from 6.5 to 9.5 in steps of 0.25 dex .",
    "it has been shown by @xcite that the inclusion of heavy metals in model atmospheres will affect the determined @xmath0 .",
    "this result is investigated in this study by including two atmospheric compositions .",
    "the first is a pure hydrogen composition , and the second is a metal polluted composition using the abundances from @xcite , with c / h=@xmath8 , n / h=@xmath9 , o / h=@xmath10 , al / h=@xmath11 , si / h=@xmath12 , p / h=@xmath13 , s / h=@xmath14 , fe / h=@xmath15 , and ni / h=@xmath16 as number fractions .",
    "@xcite calculated new stark broadening tables , including additional souces of opacity not accounted for in @xcite s tables .",
    "as the line shapes of the lyman / balmer series are affected by @xmath0 , log @xmath1 , and the broadening treatment , it is imperative to calculate the synthetic profiles as accurately as possible . to assess the effects of using either the @xcite and the @xcite calculations , all model grids are synthesised using either of these broadening tables in turn .",
    "the completeness of the atomic data supplied to model atmosphere can be inferred to have an effect upon the determined @xmath0 .",
    "radiative levitation calculations by @xcite were found to be dependent upon the number of transitions included in the calculation .",
    "we investigate this possibility by calculating the metal polluted model atmospheres using either the ku92 dataset , or the ku11 dataset .",
    "the difference between these datasets is the number of energy levels and transitions available for the ions fe / ni iv - vi .",
    "ku92 is supplemented with photoionization ( pi ) cross sections calculated by the opacity project for fe iv - vi , while ni iv - vi is supplemented with pi data calculated using an hydrogenic approximation .",
    "the ku11 data is not accompanied by pi cross section data .",
    "we therefore calculated this data using the atomic collision package autostructure @xcite .",
    "full details of this calculation will be provided in a future publication .",
    "as expected , the largest lyman / balmer line discrepancies occur when pure h grids are used to measure @xmath0 . curiously , however , in the case of wd1254 + 233 , which is known to be a pure h atmosphere star , the discrepancy between the lyman / balmer line @xmath0 is not affected by the metal content , but is resolved upon using the @xcite broadening tables . in the case of the metal rich stars ,",
    "the discrepancies between the lyman / balmer @xmath0 are greatly reduced when using a metal polluted model grid , and are improved further when these grids are synthesised using the @xcite tables . in figure",
    "[ fig : teffres ] , we have plotted the measured @xmath0 using the lyman / balmer lines for the different types of model grid used .",
    "we have also tabulated the @xmath0 determinations in table [ table : results ] .",
    "interestingly , the use of ku11 data in model atmosphere calculations does not appear to have any noticable effect upon the determined @xmath0 , regardless of the stark broadening table employed .",
    "it is for this reason we have omitted the ku11 results from figure [ fig : teffres ] .",
    "the next step to try and improve the agreement between the lyman / balmer is to allow variations in the metal abundances .",
    "this will be done by calculating a set of model grids for different multiples of the g191-b2b abundances used in this proceeding .",
    "we also plan to include more stars in our sample .",
