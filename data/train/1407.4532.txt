    "recent observations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies by various groups @xcite suggest that the universe began to expand at very high energies beyond the planck scale .",
    "there , spacetime would be totally fluctuating according to the laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "thus , quantum gravity is now becoming an indispensable theory to describe the dynamics of the early universe .    on the other hand , at first glance",
    ", it seems to be contradictory that we trace the origin of primordial fluctuations to quantum gravity , because the observations show that scalar fluctuations are more significant than tensor ones in the early universe .",
    "this implies that if we wish to explain such fluctuations using quantum gravity only without adding a phenomenological scalar field , we have to construct a model whose physical states become scalarlike in the uv limit .    in order to resolve this problem",
    ", we propose a model of quantum gravity with a certain gauge symmetry imposing that all spacetimes related to each other under conformal transformations are equivalent , called the becchi - rouet - stora - tyutin ( brst ) conformal invariance here , as a representation of the background - metric independence .",
    "it has been known that the riegert action plays a significant role to realize it @xcite .",
    "we then have shown that the riegert theory including the kinetic term of the weyl action has such a gauge symmetry as a part of diffeomorphism invariance , which is so strong that physical fields are restricted to  real composite scalars \" ( called primary scalars ) only @xcite .",
    "the model we consider here is the renormalizable quantum theory of gravity expanded just from this background - free system by a single dimensionless coupling constant that brings the dynamics of traceless tensor fields .",
    "the strategy we employ here to construct such a quantum gravity model is as follows . to begin with",
    ", we have to reduce the indefiniteness potentially existing in the fourth - order gravitational system . in order to settle this issue",
    ", we have considered massless qed in curved space as a gate for quantum gravity in view of the significance of conformal couplings .",
    "since the qed - gravity coupling is unambiguously fixed by gauge symmetry and tractable much better than gravitational self - couplings , we can derive the definite conclusion on the gravitational counterterm at all orders @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we can expect the similarity between the gauge field part and the traceless tensor part ruled by the weyl action .",
    "the quantum gravity model mentioned above can be constructed on the basis of this counterterm .",
    "the original form of this quantum gravity model has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to advance the study of this model based on the renormalization group ( rg ) equations and make sure that it is a consistent renormalizable quantum theory of gravity .",
    "from the analysis of the rg equations using dimensional regularization @xcite , it has been recently shown that the gravitational counterterms for massless qed in curved space can be determined at all orders of the perturbation @xcite , which are given by only two forms : the square of the weyl tensor @xmath0 in @xmath1 dimensions and the modified euler density defined by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the usual euler combination and @xmath4 is the rescaled scalar curvature .",
    "the coefficient @xmath5 is a finite function of @xmath1 only , which can be determined order by order in a series of @xmath6 as @xmath7 by solving the rg equations .",
    "the first three terms of @xmath5 are explicitly calculated as @xcite @xmath8    furthermore , we have shown that the conformal anomaly related to the counterterm ( [ expression of g_d ] ) is expressed in the form @xmath9 . here",
    ", it is significant that the familiar ambiguous term @xmath10 is fixed completely and this combination reduces to @xmath11 in the four - dimensional limit due to @xmath12 .",
    "it is just the combination proposed by riegert , which produces the kinetic term of the conformal factor @xcite .    as for conformal couplings",
    ", we expect that the coefficients of @xmath5 , especially @xmath13 , have universal values independent of the theory .",
    "really , the values ( [ values of chi ] ) are not changed even when any number of fermions is added below , and also partially confirmed for @xmath14-scalar theory @xcite and yang - mills theory @xcite in curved space .",
    "on the other hand , unfortunately , we have found that the original action conjectured in the early work @xcite as a renormalizable quantum theory of gravity becomes slightly different from the expression ( [ expression of g_d ] ) at higher orders ( see also footnote [ footnotee actually ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to reconsider our quantum gravity model based on the more proper action ( [ expression of g_d ] ) determined in a theoretically established manner using the rg equations and check again whether it indeed gives a consistent quantum gravity .",
    "the quantum gravity action we study here is thus defined by @xmath15 beyond the planck scale , where @xmath16 is a dynamical coupling constant , while @xmath17 is not so , as discussed below .",
    "the lower - derivative actions such as the einstein action are suppressed here .",
    "we consider the perturbation theory in @xmath16 expanding about a conformally flat space defined by @xmath18 , which is characterized by the expansion of the metric field : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the background metric .",
    "thus , the quantum gravity model can be described as a quantum field theory on the background @xmath21 . at this time , it is significant that the conformal factor @xmath22 is treated exactly without introducing its own coupling constant , because the conformally flat condition does not give any restrictions on it .",
    "as in the previous study @xcite , we consider the model coupled to massless qed : @xmath23 , where @xmath24 .",
    "the renormalization factors are defined by @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 for photon , @xmath28 fermions and traceless tensor fields , respectively , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 for coupling constants , where the ward - takahashi identity holds even when qed couples with quantized gravity . on the other hand , @xmath31 is not renormalized such that @xmath32 because there is no coupling constant for this field .",
    "the nonrenomalization theorem of @xmath31 is related to the geometrical property of @xmath33 ( [ expression of g_d ] ) @xcite . since its",
    "volume integral becomes topological at four dimensions , it is not dynamical at the classical level . therefore , @xmath17 is not the independent coupling that governs the dynamics of gravity .",
    "so we expand the bare parameter @xmath17 in a pure - pole series as @xcite @xmath34 since the field dependence of the volume integral of @xmath33 appears at @xmath35 , this expansion indicates that the dynamics is induced at the quantum level by canceling out the pole with the @xmath1 dependence of the action .",
    "the residues @xmath36 depend on the coupling constants , while the simple - pole residue has a coupling - independent part , which is divided as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is coupling dependent and @xmath39 is a constant part .    in order to carry out the rg analysis systematically , incorporating the dynamics induced quantum mechanically ,",
    "we propose the following procedure . for the moment",
    ", @xmath39 is regarded as a new coupling constant , instead of the finite term usually introduced in @xmath17 .",
    "the effective action is then finite up to the topological term as follows : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the renormalized quantity that depends on the coupling constants .",
    "the divergent term exists in a curved background only .",
    "the constant @xmath42 comes from the sum of direct one - loop calculations of qed @xcite and gravitational fields @xcite .",
    ", where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are the numbers of conformally coupled scalars , fermions , and gauge fields , and the last term is the sum of @xmath46 and @xmath47 coming from the gravitational fields , @xmath31 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "] after the renormalization procedure is carried out , we take @xmath49 . in this way",
    ", we can obtain the finite effective action @xmath50 whose dynamics is governed by a single gravitational coupling @xmath51 .",
    "the perturbative calculation can be performed by choosing the flat background as follows .",
    "expanding the volume integral of @xmath33 ( [ expression of g_d ] ) , we obtain @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the couplings with traceless tensor fields are not presented here ( see @xcite ) .",
    "as a convention in this paper , the same lower indices denote contraction by the flat background metric . substituting the explicit values of @xmath13 and @xmath55 in ( [ values of chi ] ) calculated using qed in curved space and neglecting @xmath56 , the coefficients reduce to @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    "therefore , the action is expanded as @xmath59                   + \\cdots \\biggr\\ } .",
    "\\label{expansion of g_d action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term of the rhs is just the riegert action @xcite in flat background induced in terms of dimensional regularization , which gives the propagator of @xmath31 .",
    "thus , quantum corrections from this field are expanded in @xmath60 , which corresponds to the large-@xmath28 expansion .",
    "the other terms are the induced vertices that become effective at loop level .",
    "the vertices from @xmath61 are disregarded here because they are not the leading terms of each order of @xmath6 yielding the most singular diagrams .",
    "the terms denoted by dots include the vertices and counterterms coming from the residues @xmath38 and @xmath62 .",
    "similarly , the weyl and qed actions are expanded in powers of @xmath31 .",
    "it has been checked in the original paper @xcite that the renormalization procedure mentioned above , especially the nonrenormalization theorem of @xmath31 , goes well at higher loops up to @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 through direct calculations using the qed - gravity couplings and the gravitational self - couplings fixed by @xmath66 in ( [ expansion of g_d action ] ) including the corresponding couplings with the traceless tensor field not denoted here . in @xcite",
    ", we have also discussed the rg equation for @xmath39 , but it is somewhat incomplete .",
    "this paper aims to justify the procedure through the rg analysis and test it directly , including the vertices of higher orders coming from @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , we proceed with the argument without specifying the value of @xmath67 here.actually , the values of @xmath66 agree with those conjectured in @xcite , but @xmath67 unfortunately disagrees . in @xcite , the @xmath33 action was determined by imposing the extra condition that the vertex @xmath68 in ( [ expansion of g_d action ] ) should vanish from analogy with the solvable two - dimensional quantum gravity action @xmath69 expanded near two dimensions . although we imposed this condition with intent to rederive the exact expression of the anomalous dimension , we will find in sect.4 that regardless of this vertex we can derive it . ]",
    "the beta functions for the coupling constants @xmath70 and @xmath71 are defined by @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively . using the renormalization factors , they are expressed as @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the pure - pole term @xmath76 is divided as @xmath77 . from the rg equation @xmath78",

    ", we obtain the rg equation @xmath85 for @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is taken into account for @xmath88 .",
    "this equation reduces to that in curved space @xcite when the dependence on @xmath89 and @xmath39 turns off .",
    "thus , the present renormalization procedure is consistent with the results in curved space .",
    "the finite expression is then given by @xmath90 the @xmath91-dependent terms of @xmath92 and @xmath93 have been calculated up to @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively @xcite .",

    "in the same way , expanding as @xmath109 , we obtain the similar rg equations for @xmath110 .",
    "the beta function has been calculated as @xcite @xmath111 thus , the coupling constant @xmath89 indicates the asymptotic freedom , which justifies the perturbation theory about conformally flat spacetime .",
    "the background - free nature of spacetime will be realized owing to the nonperturbative treatment of the conformal factor characterized by ( [ metric expansion ] ) . indeed ,",
    "the conformal change of the background metric @xmath112 is equivalent to the shift of the field @xmath113 , which is nothing but the rewriting of the integration variable @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , the background - metric independence can be expressed as the shift invariance of the path integral measure .",

    "<S> , we propose how to handle the euler term systematically , incorporating such dynamics on the basis of renormalization group analysis using dimensional regularization . as a nontrivial test of renormalization </S>",
    "<S> , we explicitly calculate the three - loop anomalous dimension of the cosmological constant operator and show that it agrees with the exact expression derived using the brst conformal symmetry . the physical significance to inflation and the cosmic microwave background </S>",
