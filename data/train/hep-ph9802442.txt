    "bremsstrahlung and pair creation are two of the most common high energy electromagnetic processes , and the interaction cross sections are well known ( bethe and heitler , 1934 ) .",
    "however , it is much less well known that these cross sections can change dramatically depending on the environment in which the interaction occurs .",
    "the slac e-146 collaboration observed photon intensities as low as 1/4 of that predicted by bethe and heitler , and much larger suppression is possible .",
    "the cross sections change because the kinematics of the processes dictates the interactions are spread over a significant distance , in contrast to the conventional picture where reactions occur at a single point .",
    "the momentum transfer between a highly relativistic interacting particle and the target nucleus can be small , especially along the direction of particle motion .",
    "when this longitudinal momentum transfer is small , the uncertainty principle dictates that the interaction is spread out over a distance , known as the formation length for particle production , or , more generally , as the coherence length .",
    "if the medium in the neighborhood of the interaction has enough influence on the interacting particle during its passage through the formation zone , then the pair production or bremsstrahlung can be suppressed . when the formation length is long",
    ", weak but cumulative factors can be important .",
    "some of the factors that may suppress electromagnetic radiation are multiple scattering , photon interactions with the medium ( coherent forward compton scattering ) , and magnetic fields . in crystals , where the atoms are arranged in ordered rows , a large variety of effects can suppress or enhance radiation .",
    "the formation length has a number of interesting physical interpretations .",
    "it is the wavelength of the exchanged virtual photon .",
    "it is also the distance required for the final state particles to separate enough ( by a compton wavelength ) that they act as separate particles .",
    "it is also the distance over which the amplitudes from several interactions can add coherently to the total cross section .",
    "all of these pictures can be helpful in understanding different aspects of suppression mechanisms .",
    "the formation length was first considered by ter - mikaelian in 1952 ( feinberg , 1994 ) .",
    "it occurs in both classical and quantum mechanical calculations .",

    "the formation length is the distance over which this phase factor maintains coherence ; the electron and photon have slightly different velocities , which causes them to gradually separate . coherence is maintained over a distance for which @xmath5 . around an isolated atom @xmath6 , so , neglecting the ( small ) angle between @xmath3 and @xmath7 , for a straight trajectory @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the electron energy , @xmath10 is the electron mass , and @xmath11 the speed of light .",
    "the @xmath12 subscript denotes the unsuppressed ( free space ) formation length .",
    "electromagnetic interactions are spread over this distance .",
    "if @xmath9 is large and @xmath1 small , @xmath13 can be very long .",
    "for example , for a 25 gev electron radiating a 10 mev bremsstrahlung photon , @xmath14 m .",

    "the formation length also occurs in quantum mechanical calculations .",
    "electron bremsstrahlung , where an electron interacts with a nucleus and emits a real photon is a good example .",
    "as the electron accelerates , part of its surrounding virtual photon field shakes loose . neglecting the photon emission angle and electron scattering ,",
    "the momentum transfer in the longitudinal ( @xmath15 ) direction is @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the electron momenta before and after the interaction respectively and the photon momentum @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the photon energy . for @xmath21",
    "this simplifies to @xmath22 here , we have used the small @xmath23 approximation @xmath24 . for high energy electrons emitting low energy photons , @xmath25 can become very small . for the above example , @xmath26ev / c . because @xmath25 is so small",

    "( [ lf0c ] ) ; the momentum transfer approach is needed only for @xmath29 .",
    "this formation length appears in most electromagnetic processes including pair production , transition radiation , erenkov radiation and synchrotron radiation .",
    "usually , @xmath25 acquires additional terms to account for specific interactions with the target medium .",
    "this review will discuss a number of these additions , and show how they affect bremsstrahlung and pair production .",
    "formation lengths also apply to processes involving other forces ; this review will consider a few non - electromagnetic interactions , showing how kinematics can dictate that diverse reactions share many fundamental traits .",
    "the formation length is the distance over which the interaction amplitudes can add coherently .",
    "so , if an external force doubles @xmath25 , thereby halving @xmath30 , then the radiation intensity is also halved , from @xmath31 to @xmath32 as the trajectory splits into two independent emitting regions .",
    "if an electron traversing a distance @xmath33 radiates , the trajectory acts as @xmath34 independent emitters , each with a strength proportional to @xmath35 , so the total radiation is proportional to @xmath30 . as external factors increase @xmath25 and reduce @xmath30 , the radiation drops proportionally .    a similar coherence distance @xmath36 limits the perpendicular distance over which coherent addition is possible .",
    "however , because @xmath37 , this distance is much smaller , and of lesser interest here .",
    "this article begins by considering separate classical and quantum mechanical ( semi - classical ) calculations of suppression due to multiple scattering .",
    "suppression due to photon interactions with the medium , pair creation and external magnetic fields will then be similarly considered .",

    "however , if the formalism is extended to include hard radiation , and some additional graphs are added , then bdms becomes equivalent to the zakharov formalism ( r. baier , 1998b ) .    for blankenbecler and drell , the only obvious point of comparison",
    "is the potential ; zakharov ( 1996b ) states that the blankenbecler and drell potential does not match the coulomb potential , and will not show the logarithmic dependence given by the slow variation of @xmath479 or @xmath329 .",
    "the results can also be compared numerically .",
    "unfortunately , these calculations are very complex and the descriptions frequently lack adequate information for independent computation .",
    "so , it is necessary to rely on the results given by the authors .",
    "one point of comparison is defined by slac e-146 data on a thin target : 25 gev electrons passing through a 0.7  %  @xmath93 thick gold target .",
    "the e-146 data agreed well with migdal as long as @xmath522 ; at lower @xmath42 , ternovskii s eq .",
    "( [ esigmashulga ] ) matched the data .",
    "blankenbecler and drell , zakharov , and baier and katkov all showed good agreement with this data .",
    "zakharov initially added in a 7% normalization factor to match the data .",
    "some correction is required , because , even for a 0.7% @xmath93 target , the multiphoton pileup ` correction ' is still several percent . with",
    "a correction for multiphoton emission zakharov ( 1998b ) found normalization coefficients average 1 , except for the uranium targets .",
    "zakharov also changed his approach to coulomb corrections between the two works .",
    "the other authors do not discuss normalization .",
    "overall , in this energy range , the different approaches agree with each other to within about 5% .    because of the different logarithmic treatment , migdal , blankenbecler and drell , and zakharov",
    "will scale slightly differently with energy .",
    "changes depending on target thickness are more complicated ; the surprising agreement found by baier and katkov for the 2%  @xmath93 tungsten data , where multiple interactions are a 20% correction , shows that there there are significant uncertainties in scaling the results with target thickness .",
    "it would also be interesting to compare the calculations for a low @xmath43 target , where the e-146 data showed some disagreement with migdal .",
    "one weakness of all of these calculations is that they only consider the lowest order diagrams . for fixed @xmath23",
    ", @xmath30 rises with @xmath9 , even with lpm suppression . at high enough energies , the formation zones from different emissions will overlap , and any lowest order calculation will fail .",
    "dielectric suppression is strong enough that @xmath30 decreases and localization improves with increasing suppression , so it is less subject to this problem .",
    "however , for multiple scattering , a method of dealing with higher order terms is needed .",
    "while the radiative corrections to bremsstrahlung are known ( fomin , 1958 ) , they were not computed with suppression mechanisms in mind .    even neglecting the overlapping formation zones , when suppression is large , higher order terms are important , because higher order processes involve larger @xmath25 , and hence are less subject to suppression ; sec .",
    "ii.h illustrated this for direct pair production .",
    "so , when suppression is strong ( @xmath523 ) , current calculations are suspect . for qcd calculations , discussed in sec .",
    "[ sqcd ] the problem is much worse because of the large coupling constant , @xmath524 .",
    "it is worth noting that suppression can affect other processes , via radiative corrections .",
    "the total cross section for coulomb scattering , for example , is the sum of the elastic cross section plus the cross section for bremsstrahlung where the photon is not observable .",
    "since suppression can affect the latter process , it can indirectly change the elastic scattering cross section ( ter - mikaelian , 1972 , pg . 135 ) .",
    "inelastic processes , which leave the target atom in an excited state can also contribute significantly to the cross section when suppression of the lowest order diagrams is large .",
    "there has been some controversy as to how well classical electrodynamics can predict lpm suppression .",
    "the original landau and pomeranchuk ( 1953a , b ) calculations were completely classical ; they failed at the same point that classical bremsstrahlung calculation fail : when @xmath29 .",
    "the path integral approach ( laskin , mazmanishvili and shulga , 1984 ) goes further , and reproduces migdal s result in the same limit .",
    "of course , at least semi - classical calculations are necessary for pair production .",
    "the main advantage of quantum mechanical calculations is that it covers the complete range of @xmath23 .",
    "the newest calculations include features not found in the classical approaches .",
    "however , some of the advances , such as separate elastic and inelastic potentials could certainly be included in a classical calculation .    in the future , quantum approaches",
    "appear necessary to calculate the higher order terms that become important at extremely high energies , when formation lengths from different emissions begin overlapping .",
    "unfortunately , these calculations seem extremely difficult , and are probably a long way off .    however , the classical approach to lpm suppression was not universally accepted . bell ( 1958 )",
    "stated that migdal s predictions conflicted with classical electrodynamics , and concluded that `` any real effect of this kind is of essentially quantal origin . ''",
    "he pointed out that the classical radiation , eq .",
    "( [ classicalb ] ) , is positive definite , and hence monotonically increasing for increasing pathlength .",
    "however , bell neglected to account for the fact that , in a dense solid , the electron trajectory @xmath4 changes , and one can not simply sum the radiation due to interactions with separate nuclei . even classically , emission from the different pieces of electron pathlength can interfere , in a manner similar to other classical interference effects .",
    "bremsstrahlung or pair creation suppression can be studied with high energy electron or photon beams . because pair creation suppression requires photons with @xmath525 , beyond the reach of current accelerators ,",
    "pair creation has been studied only with cosmic rays , with consequently very limited statistics .",
    "the best suppression studies have used electron beams at accelerators . besides the lpm effect , these beams have been used to study dielectric suppression .",
    "the first tests of lpm suppression came shortly after migdal s paper appeared .",
    "these experiments used high energy ( @xmath526 tev ) photons in cosmic rays , and studied the depth of pair conversion in a dense target .",
    "the earliest experiments looked for a deficiency of low energy electrons in electromagnetic cascades ( miesowicz , stanisz and wolther , 1957 ) .",
    "this analysis is difficult because of uncertainties in the incoming photon spectrum and electron energy measurement .",
    "fowler , perkins and pinkau ( 1959 ) studied isolated pair production in an emulsion stack .",
    "they measured the shower energy and the distance between the initial conversion and the first daughter pair resulting from the primary .",
    "they observed 47 showers with @xmath526 tev . as @xmath42 increased , the distance between the conversions rose , as predicted by migdal , contrasting with with decrease predicted by bethe- heitler .",
    "varfolomeev and collaborators ( 1960 ) used a similar approach , albeit on a smaller data set , with similar results .",
    "they selected events where the energy of the daughter pair was very small ( @xmath367 ) , and found qualitative evidence for suppression ; they did not differentiate between lpm and dielectric suppression .",
    "lohrmann ( 1961 ) , studied emulsion exposed on high altitude balloon flights . compared to earlier results , lohrmann studied lower energies , where the lpm and bethe - heitler cross sections are much closer . however , the increased photon flux allowed for much better statistics , making up for the smaller cross section difference .",
    "lohrmann used a variety of analysis techniques , all of which supported migdal s results .",
    "more recently , long duration balloon experiments have gathered somewhat larger data samples , up to 120 events , with similar results ( strausz , 1991 ) .",
    "kasahara ( 1985 ) studied the development of @xmath527100 tev showers in lead / emulsion chambers exposed to cosmic rays on mt .",
    "his analysis was based on the fact that electromagnetic lpm showers with @xmath528 penetrate considerably more material than bethe - heitler showers .",
    "kasahara found that the shower development profiles matched simulations based on migdal , but differed from his bethe - heitler simulations .",
    "the study suffered from a background from hadronic and/or multiple photon showers , both also subject to large fluctuations .",
    "kasahara removed 5 obvious background events from his initial 19 event sample , but warned that some of the remainder could also be hadronic .",
    "this study is of special interest as it is the only study yet in the region @xmath252 , where suppression affects shower development .",
    "all of the air shower experiments suffered from some common problems , by far the largest being the poor statistics ; high enough energy photons are not common .",
    "in addition , because of the limited emulsion thickness , they did not consider surface effects .",
    "finally , uncertainties in the photon spectrum complicated the analysis .",
    "for these reasons ,",
    "these experiments are at best qualitative verifications of lpm suppression .      by the 1970 s ,",
    "40 gev electron beams were available at serpukhov , and the first accelerator based test of lpm suppression was done there ( varfolomeev , 1975 ) .",
    "bremsstrahlung photons from 40 gev electron beams striking dense targets were detected in an sodium iodide calorimeter .",
    "the electrons were magnetically bent away from the calorimeter .",
    "photons with 20 mev @xmath529 70 mev emitted from carbon , aluminum , lead and tungsten targets were studied . below 20 mev ,",
    "synchrotron radiation from the bending magnets dominated the measurement , while above 70 mev , the experiment was insensitive to the spectral change predicted by migdal .    the experiment suffered from several limitations . because the electron beamline was in air , and included several scintillation counters used as triggers , there was a significant light element bremsstrahlung background .",
    "the experimenters also mention a significant background due to muon contamination in their beam .",
    "the collaboration presented their data in terms of ratios of photon spectra : lead / aluminum and tungsten / carbon .",
    "this may have been done to account for events containing several bremsstrahlung photons from a single electron .",
    "the data showed suppression in the region that migdal predicted .",
    "however , the degree of suppression was larger than migdal predicted , although within the large errors .",
    "cern na-43 was an experiment dedicated to studying channeling radiation from electrons and positrons in crystals ( bak , 1988 ) . in channeling , electrons or positrons travel along the crystal rows , and",
    "hence are strongly affected by the coherently adding fields from the atom rows . at large angles to the axes ,",
    "the coherence disappears , and normal bremsstrahlung occurs . in this large angle regime , they saw suppression which they attributed to lpm suppression .",
    "they also observed suppression consistent with multiple scattering for electrons incident along one of the crystal rows .",
    "this is slightly different from suppression in an amorphous material ; here the suppression is really the loss of coherent enhancement .",
    "the first experimental studies of dielectric suppression were part of a larger study of transition radiation ( arutyunyan , nazaryan and frangyan , 1971 ) .",
    "although the experiment focused on studies of emission from stacks of thin radiators , the experimenters also measured the radiation from 0.25 and 2.8 gev electrons traversing relatively thick glass and aluminum targets .",
    "although few details were given , they appeared to observe suppression in the expected energy range .      in 1992 ,",
    "the e-146 collaboration at stanford linear accelerator center ( slac ) proposed an experiment to perform a precision measurement of lpm suppression , and to study dielectric suppression ( cavalli - sforza , 1992 ) .",
    "the experiment was conceptually similar to the serpukhov experiment , but heavily optimized to minimize background . to minimize the statistical errors",
    ", the experimenters collected a very large data set .",
    "the experiment was approved in december , 1992 , and took data in march - april , 1993 .",
    "figure  [ e146layout ] shows a diagram of the experiment .",
    "an 8 or 25 gev electron beam entered slac end station a and passed through a thin target .",
    "the targets used are listed in table iii .",
    "the beam was then bent downward by a 3.25 t - m dipole magnet , through six wire chamber planes which measured electron momenta and into an array of lead glass blocks which accurately counted electrons . produced photons continued downstream 50 meters into a bgo calorimeter array . to minimize backgrounds , the electron path visible to the calorimeter and",
    "the photon flight path were kept in vacuum .",
    "the calorimeter comprised 45 bgo crystals in a 7 by 7 array with missing corners ; each crystal was 2 cm square by 20 cm ( 18  x@xmath530 ) deep .",
    "this segmentation provided excellent spatial resolution for separating synchrotron radiation from bremsstrahlung photons .",
    "scintillation light from each crystal was measured separately by a photomultipler tube ( pmt ) .",
    "the light yield was about 1 detected photoelectron per 30 kev , providing good statistics down to 200 kev .",
    "the calorimeter resolution was about 8% ( fwhm ) at 100 mev , with a nonlinearity of about 3% .",
    "the calorimeter temperature was monitored throughout the experiment , and the data corrected using the measured drifts .",
    "the collaboration used several methods to calibrate the calorimeter , to obtain both an absolute energy calibration and a crystal to crystal intercalibration .",
    "the primary tools for measuring the relative gain were nearly vertical cosmic - ray muons , selected by a plastic scintillator paddle trigger ; the gain in each crystal channel was adjusted to produce equal signals .",
    "the absolute energy scale of the calorimeter was primarily determined using a 500 mev electron beam .",
    "this calibration was checked with data by comparing the electron energy loss , measured by the wire chamber , with the calorimeter energy measurement .",
    "because of the steeply falling photon spectrum and the non - gaussian errors in the momentum measurement , this was useful only as a cross - check .",
    "because of the large bremsstrahlung cross section , the experiment required a beam intensity of about 1 electron per pulse . because it would have been very uneconomical to use the slac linac to produce a single electron per pulse ,",
    "the collaboration developed a method to run parasitically during slac linear collider ( slc ) operations , by using the off - axis electrons and positrons that are removed from the beam by scrapers in the beam switchyard ( cavalli - sforza , 1994 ) .",
    "normally , about 10% of the slc beam is scraped away by collimators in the last 200 meters of the linac .",
    "the collimators are only 2.2 x@xmath530 thick , so a usable flux of high energy photons emerged from their back and sides .",
    "some of these photons travel down the beampipe , past the magnets that bend the electrons and positrons into the slc arcs , and into the beam switchyard , where a 0.7 @xmath93 target converted them into @xmath298 pairs .",
    "some of the produced electrons were captured by the transport line optics , collimated , selected for energy , and transported into the end station .",
    "the beam worked well , with the size , divergence and yield matching simulations . at 8 and 25",
    "gev , the beam intensity was adjustable up to about 100 electrons / pulse . at 1 electron / pulse ,",
    "the beam emittance was limited by the optics , with a typical momentum bite of @xmath531.the beam optics were adjusted to minimize the photon spot size at the calorimeter ; spot sizes there were typically a few mm in diameter .",
    "the beam spot was stable enough and small enough that beam motion was not a major source of error .",
    "data was collected and written to tape on every beam pulse ( 120 hz ) . with the beam intensity averaging 1 electron / pulse , over 500,000 single electron events",
    "could be collected per eight hour shift .",
    "the experiment ran for a month , and good statistics were obtained with a variety of targets .",
    "the e-146 analysis selected events containing a single electron , as counted by the lead glass blocks .",
    "the photon energy was found by summing the energies of hit bgo crystals using a cluster - finding algorithm .",
    "the cluster finding reduced the noise level by eliminating random noise hits .",
    "the experiment studied the photon energy range from 200 kev to 500 mev , a 2500:1 dynamic range .",
    "this exceeded the linear dynamic range of the pmts and electronics , so data was taken with two different pmt gains , varied by changing the pmt high voltage .",
    "the high-@xmath42 running corresponded to 1 adc count per 100 kev and the low-@xmath42 running was 1 adc count per 13 kev , with the relative gains calibrated with the cosmic ray data .",
    "the high-@xmath42 data was used for 5 mev @xmath529 500 mev while the low-@xmath42 data covered 200 kev @xmath532 20 mev , with a weighted average used in the overlap region .",
    "these two sets of data differed in several significant ways .",
    "there were large differences in calorimeter behavior and background levels , as well as the physics topics .",
    "for @xmath533  mev , photons largely interacted by pair conversion , producing an electromagnetic shower .",
    "showers typically deposited energy in 3 - 20 crystals in the calorimeter . for @xmath534 mev , the photons interacted by single or multiple compton scattering . usually , compton scattering deposited energy in a single calorimeter crystal . sometimes , the photon compton scattered once and then escaped from the calorimeter , taking some energy with it .",
    "this added a low energy tail to the energy deposition curve .",
    "while the high-@xmath42 data had very low backgrounds , the low-@xmath42 data had significant backgrounds due to synchrotron radiation , at least for the 25 gev beams .",
    "finally , the two data sets emphasize different physics , with the high-@xmath42 data most relevant for lpm suppression , with the low-@xmath42 data more useful for studying dielectric suppression .",
    "for these reasons , the two sets of data were analyzed quite independently , and combined in the final histograms .",
    "one advance introduced by e-146 was the use of a detailed , high statistics monte carlo .",
    "the main purpose of the monte carlo was to understand multi - photon pileup .",
    "this occurred when a single electron passing through the target interacted twice , radiating two photons .",
    "the monte carlo also simulated photon absorption in the target ( anthony , 1997 ) and modelled the detector .",
    "transition radiation was treated as an integral part of the physics , rather than a background .",
    "in addition to conventional transition radiation , the predictions of ternovskii and pafomov were included as options .",
    "the monte carlo tracked electrons through the material in small steps , allowing for the possibility of bremsstrahlung in the material and transition radiation at each edge .",
    "lpm suppression was implemented using simple formulae ( stanev , 1982 ) with dielectric suppression incorporated using eq .",
    "( [ esigmamigdiel ] ) . for consistency ,",
    "the bethe - heitler cross sections were included by turning lpm suppression off from migdal s formulae , rather than using a more modern formula .",
    "the expected and measured backgrounds were both small .",
    "the major background was synchrotron radiation from the spectrometer magnet .",
    "synchrotron radiation was significant for @xmath535 mev in the 25 gev data . because the magnet bent the beam downward , the synchrotron radiation painted a stripe in the calorimeter , extending downward from the center . because of the large lever arm , and because the bending started in the fringe field of the magnet , where the field was low , the synchrotron radiation was small near the center of the calorimeter . because of the good spatial resolution of the calorimeter , most of the synchrotron radiation was removed with a cut on the photon position in the calorimeter ; photons within @xmath536 of a line downward from the calorimeter midpoint were removed ; this cut removed most of the synchrotron radiation , along with 25% of the signal .",
    "non - target related backgrounds were measured with target empty runs .",
    "the backgrounds were typically 0.001 photons with @xmath537 kev per electron , much less than the @xmath538 bremsstrahlung photons with @xmath537 kev per electron .",
    "target related backgrounds were expected to be small ; photonuclear interaction rates are small , and the events are unlikely to appear in the e-146 analysis .      because of the high statistics and low background , the e-146 data allowed for detailed tests of the theory ; photon spectra could be easily compared with different predictions .",
    "figures [ carbon]-[gold ] show a sampling of e-146 results .",
    "photon energies were histogrammed logarithmically , using 25 bins per decade of energy , so that each bin had a fractional width @xmath539 . the logarithmic scale is needed to cover the 2500:1 energy range .",
    "the logarithmic binning @xmath540 was chosen so that a @xmath457 bethe - heitler ( bh ) spectrum will have an equal number of events in each bin , simplifying the presentation and statistical analysis .",
    "figure  [ carbon ] shows the photon spectrum ( points with error bars ) from 8 and 25 gev electrons passing through 2% and 6% @xmath93 carbon targets .",
    "also shown are 3 monte carlo ( mc ) histograms .",
    "the top histogram ( dashed line ) is a simulation of bh bremsstrahlung plus conventional transition radiation ; the transition radiation is substantial below @xmath541 , 1.4 ( 0.4 ) mev at 25 ( 8) gev . above @xmath541 ,",
    "the spectrum is sloped because there is a finite probability of a single electron interacting twice while passing through the target .",
    "because the calorimeter can not separate single photons from multiple hits , but instead measures total energy deposition , this depletes the low energy end of the spectrum ( shown here ) , while increasing the number of calorimeter overflows . in the absence of multiple interactions ,",
    "the bethe - heitler spectrum would be flat at @xmath542 for bins with logarithmic widths @xmath543 .",
    "the bin heights directly scale with the bin fractional width @xmath544 .",
    ".1 in    the dotted histogram is a simulation that includes lpm suppression , but not dielectric suppression , plus conventional transition radiation .",
    "the solid line includes lpm and dielectric suppression , along with conventional transition radiation .",
    "this was the standard e-146 choice for simulation .",
    "both suppression mechanisms are required to approach the data .",
    "however , there are still significant discrepancies between the lpm plus dielectric mc and the data . below 800 kev ( 350 kev ) for 25 ( 8) gev beams , the upturn in the data may be residual background , especially synchrotron radiation .",
    "the difference at higher photon energies is more complex , and will be discussed in the following subsection .",
    "figure  [ aluminum ] shows the spectrum from 8 and 25 gev electrons passing through 3% and 6% @xmath93 aluminum targets .",
    "the same three simulations are shown . because aluminum has twice the @xmath43 of carbon , lpm suppression is considerably enhanced , with @xmath216 8 mev and 800 kev at 25 and 8 gev respectively . because the density is similar to carbon , dielectric suppression is similar . because dielectric suppression dominates for @xmath414 ,",
    "the curve for both suppressions is similar to that of carbon .",

    "the pafomov curve jumps at @xmath545 , around 800 kev ( 400 kev ) at 25 ( 8) gev , corresponding from the switch from eq .",

    "this discrepancy would likely disappear with an input cross section where the onset of suppression was more gradual around @xmath560 .",
    "the errors shown on the plots are statistical only .",
    "the e-146 collaboration has carefully studied the systematic errors on these measurements .",
    "the point - to - point systematic errors vary slowly with @xmath42 and correspond to a 4.6% uncertainty for @xmath483 mev .",

    "the @xmath561 systematic error on the normalization was determined separately .",
    "although the data clearly demonstrates lpm and dielectric suppression , the thinnest targets show excess radiation over the bulk lpm predictions .",
    "this can easily be ascribed to surface radiation .",
    "as long as interference between the two target edges is negligible , the surface and bulk effects can be separated in a model independent way by subtracting spectra from targets made of the same material , but different thicknesses .",
    "figure [ subtract ] shows the results of this subtraction for uranium .",
    "because the subtraction exacerbates the effects of multiple interactions in the target , it is necessary to compare the subtracted spectra with similarly treated simulations .",
    "for all of the e-146 materials , the subtracted spectra and simulations agree more closely than the unsubtracted spectra , and , for most targets , the agreement is within the statistical and systematic errors .",
    "the notable exceptions are the 25 gev iron and carbon data .",
    "the improved agreement indicates that the discrepancies in the unsubtracted spectra are due to surface effects . for the denser targets ,",
    "this fits the expectations for transition radiation .",
    "however , for the lighter carbon and iron targets , the unsubtracted data indicates more suppression than expected .",
    "this implies that there is negative emission from the surfaces , an extremely unlikely result .",
    "the collaboration ( anthony , 1997 ) considered a few explanations for the discrepancies . for carbon , the increased suppression could be due to the crystalline structure of the pyrolitic graphite target .",
    "if the target density profile varied , then the higher density regions would show more suppression , and the aggregate would show somewhat higher lpm and dielectric suppression . for iron , magnetization of individual domains could produce some magnetic suppression .",
    "unfortunately , the details depend on the ( unknown ) domain structure .    the density profile could also vary if the target surfaces were oxidized . for the @xmath562 tungsten target ,",
    "the collaboration saw some evidence for this ; thickness measurements based on weighing ( giving results in @xmath563 ) were lower than those obtained with calipers ; an oxide layer could explain this .",
    "the anomalous normalization on the 2% tungsten target could also be explained by an oxide layer . for the lighter targets",
    ", a surface layer could explain the shapes of the curves , but the required thickness seems very unrealistic , and , in any case , the presence of such a layer is not supported by the normalization and thickness measurements .",
    "it is also possible that migdal s theory may be inadequate for lighter targets .",
    "however , zakharov ( 1998b ) also found a very poor fit for the e-146 carbon data , despite a careful treatment of inelastic electron - electron interactions . in comparison ,",
    "his fits to the other data were quite good .",
    "it is possible , although probably unlikely , that a different treatment , would find a better fit .",
    "it is also possible that a calculation taking into account the chemical structure of the pyrolitic graphite and using screening based on the actual electron density might better fit the data .",
    "the subtraction procedure could be modified to measure the transition radiation spectrum from a single surface . however , the errors are slightly too large for the result to be interesting .",
    "overall , the e-146 heavy target data is in good agreement with most of the recent treatments of lpm suppression .",
    "however , the shape of the spectra from the lightest targets remain a bit of a mystery .",
    "so far , we have considered particles moving through a medium . however , in a plasma , there is no separate incident particle , and each particle must be treated on an even footing .",
    "if the medium is sufficiently dense , there can be suppression even for non - relativistic particles .",
    "then , the formation time @xmath564 is easier to use than the formation length . if @xmath564 is longer than the mean time between collisions @xmath565 , @xmath566 being the collision rate , then emission can be suppressed .",
    "one hadronic example of a plasma is a supernova ; with the high temperature and density , @xmath567 is very short . for reactions with @xmath568 , suppression",
    "may be present .",
    "one interesting reaction is the production of right handed neutrinos or axions through @xmath569 , @xmath570 and @xmath571 .",
    "if these hypothetical particles exist and are produced , they will carry energy away from the explosion , increasing the cooling rate .",
    "the measured cooling rate has been used to put limits on these particles ( raffelt and seckel , 1991 ) .    for axions or neutrinos , @xmath572 , where @xmath573 is the sum of the neutrino energies or the axion energy . when @xmath574 , then free collisions are rare",
    ". instead , the interacting nucleons are excited , this can be modelled by giving the nucleon an effective mass , as may be done with photons in dielectric suppression .",
    "two complications come from the possibility of back reactions , and from the degeneracy of the incoming particles .",
    "the suppression is the ratio of the emission @xmath575 to @xmath576 : @xmath577 here , @xmath84 accounts for the multiplicity of the emitted particles , with @xmath578 for axions and @xmath579 for neutrino pairs ; for axions this equation matches eq .",
    "( [ sdiel ] ) . because @xmath566 depends on the local density ; finding the overall suppression factor for an entire supernova requires detailed modelling",
    ". however , raffelt and seckel estimate that @xmath139 could be as small as 0.1 .",
    "so , far fewer axions and neutrinos are emitted than if suppression were absent , and earlier limits that neglect this reduction are invalid ( raffelt and seckel , 1991 ) .",
    "the general solution for an non - equilibrium electromagnetic plasma has been elegantly formulated using non - equilibrium quantum field theory ( knoll and voskresensky , 1995 , 1996 ) . by careful classification of diagrams , and",
    "appropriate resumnation , knoll and voskresensky avoided infrared divergences , and reproduced both the classical ( non - suppressed ) and quasi - particle ( low density ) limits by appropriate choice of subsets of graphs . in a dense plasma , the quasi - free scattering approximation breaks down , and the reaction rate is reduced by @xmath580 this equation also matches eq .",
    "( [ sdiel ] ) , with @xmath581 of the medium replaced by @xmath566 , the relaxation rate of the source .",
    "a plasma like this might surround a quantum black hole . before a quantum black hole explodes",
    ", it emits a huge flux of charged particles .",
    "this radiation forms a nearly thermal photosphere , consisting of electrons , positrons and photons ( heckler , 1995 ) .",
    "the charged particle emission rate and consequent density is high enough that bremsstrahlung and pair production should be suppressed in this plasma .",
    "since most of the emitted particles are hadrons , the black hole may also generate a dense color plasma , akin to a quark gluon plasma , with interactions suppressed as discussed in the following section .",
    "similar plasma effects probably occurred during the big bang .",
    "unfortunately , we do not know of any calculations involving it .",
    "although the lpm effect is best studied using single interactions in thin targets , most real world situations involve electromagnetic showers in thick targets .",
    "this includes natural processes like cosmic ray air showers and neutrino induced electromagnetic showers , and showers in man - made detectors .",
    "although modelling showers with suppression effects requires complex analytic calculations or monte carlo simulations , this section will present some simple calculations that show when suppression effects can be important .",
    "suppression affects showers in several ways . besides the obvious elongation when @xmath145 and the radiation length increases , the shower changes form , with the low energy fuzz disappearing , and shower to shower fluctuations become much more important , because the number of interactions drops greatly .",
    "many calculations have concerned high energy shower development in water or ice , an area relevant to high energy neutrino astronomy , or in air , an application motivated by extremely high energy ( ehe ) cosmic ray air showers .",
    "the latter case is complicated because the air density varies exponentially with altitude .",
    "water and ice showers are of interest for detecting very high energy astrophysical @xmath582 through resonant @xmath319 production , @xmath583 and similar reactions .",
    "this cross section rises rapidly at the w pole , corresponding to a @xmath582 initial energy of 6.4 pev , an average of 2.1 pev of which goes to the outgoing electron . since 2.1 pev@xmath584",
    ", lpm suppression is significant . as fig .",
    "[ suppressionvse ] shows , the electron radiation length is increased by about 35% . since @xmath585",
    ", pair creation will also cause suppression for a range of @xmath42 .    at similar energies ,",
    "the search for @xmath586 events ( learned and pakvasa , 1995 ) in ice requires distinguishing the @xmath587 track from the beginning of an electron shower ; when suppression mechanisms reduce the number of low energy bremsstrahlung photons , this separation becomes more difficult .",
    "because both applications involve very high energy showers , direct simulations have been limited by the available computer power ; until recently at least partially analytic calculations were needed .",
    "these analytic methods owe much of their history to earlier analytic calculations of bethe - heitler shower development .",
    "one of the first analytic calculations ( pomanskii , 1970 ) showed that the penetrating power of electromagnetic showers rises as the lpm effect becomes important . at @xmath588-@xmath589 ev in earth , electrons and photons become as penetrating as muons .",
    "misaki ( 1990 ) used the matrix method to show that em showers above @xmath590 ev in water are elongated by the lpm effect . in the tails of the shower , at a given sampling depth , the lpm effect roughly triples the density .    unfortunately , while analytic calculations can determine the average shower shape , they have limited value for understanding shower to shower variations ; for this , simulations are needed . to reduce the computing load , hybrid monte",
    "carlos are often used .",
    "a hybrid mc simulates the initial shower development ; shower tails are added on based on a library of simulated complete showers .",
    "this reduces the computational requirements significantly .",
    "stanev and collaborators ( 1982 ) measured shower elongation in water and lead due to the lpm effect using a hybrid mc .",
    "konishi  ( 1991 ) used a hybrid mc to study fluctuations in a regime where suppression is very strong : @xmath270 ev showers in lead .",
    "in contrast to bh showers , lpm showers showed large shower to shower variations . by eliminating soft bremsstrahlung",
    ", the lpm effect greatly reduces the number of interactions per radiation length , so the shower development depends on far fewer interactions , greatly increasing the shower to shower variation .",
    "the variation complicates energy measurement , especially for detectors with limited sampling .",
    "misaki ( 1993 ) , quantified the degree of fluctuation , measuring the distribution of the depth of shower maximum , the depth at which the number of shower particles is a maximum . for @xmath270 ev showers in rock ( @xmath591 tev )",
    ", he found that shower maximum occurs at @xmath592 ( fwhm ) @xmath93 for bh showers , compared with @xmath593 @xmath93 for lpm showers .",
    "not only is the maximum deeper , but its position varies much more .    not considered here is the increased angular spreading caused by suppression .",
    "although it may be not affect the general shower shape , it is probably important in understanding radio waves produced by showers in ice ( zas , 1997 ) , where the spectrum depends on the transverse separation between particles .",
    "cosmic ray air showers occur when ehe cosmic rays hit the earths atmosphere and interacts to produce a cascade of particles ( sokolsky , sommers and dawson , 1992 ) .",
    "showers up to @xmath594 ev have been seen ( bird , 1994 ) .",
    "two techniques are used to study the highest energy air showers .",
    "large aperture telescopes , like the flys eye ( bird , 1994 ) observe the shower induced fluorescence of the @xmath595 in air , measuring the shower development in the atmosphere .",
    "ground based arrays of hundreds or thousands of small detectors , spaced up to a kilometer apart , observe the remnants of the shower that reach the ground ( takeda , 1998 ) ( auger , 1996 ) .",
    "ground based detectors act as calorimeters with a single sampling layer , located behind a 28 @xmath93 , or 15 hadronic interaction lengths , @xmath596 thick atmospheric absorber . for a vertical @xmath589 ev shower ,",
    "sea level is near shower maximum , so measurements are not too sensitive to the position of the first interaction . for obliquely incident showers ,",
    "the detector is considerably behind shower maximum , and as a result , ground observations are subject to significant fluctuations depending on the position of the first interaction . because of their limited ground coverage , most of their samples are many moliere radii from the shower core , in the tails of the angular distribution .",
    "this heightens the sensitivity of the detector to the details of the initial interactions .    on the other hand ,",
    "air fluorescence detectors measure the whole shower profile , with the atmosphere acting as a fully active sampling medium .",
    "they are thus less sensitive to the details of the shower development .",
    "there has been considerable disagreement about whether the lpm effect is important in ultra - high energy showers .",
    "capdevielle and attallah ( 1992 ) found that lpm suppression had a significant effect on @xmath588 to @xmath589 ev proton induced air showers .",
    "however , kalmykov , ostapchenko and pavlov ( 1995 ) found a much smaller change ; for a @xmath589 ev shower , they found a 5% decrease in the number of electrons at shower maximum , and a @xmath597 g/@xmath598 downward shift in the position of shower maximum .",
    "although this shift is smaller than the measurement resolution , it is systematic , and important in studies of cosmic ray composition .",
    "kasahara ( 1996 ) found that the lpm effect reduces the number of particles reaching the ground by about 10% for a @xmath599 ev proton shower .",
    "none of these authors considered the effect of other suppression mechanisms .",
    "although a complete monte carlo simulation is required to quantify the effect of suppression , simple calculations can illustrate some qualitative features of shower development ( klein , 1997 ) .",
    "the calculations depend strongly on the identity of the incoming particles , with protons ( or neutrons ) the most popular , although photons or heavier nuclei can not be excluded . for heavy ions ,",
    "suppression is greatly reduced because of the lower per - nucleon energy . because this model is very simple",
    ", the possibility of photons pair converting in the earth s magnetic field will be neglected ( kasahara , 1996)(stanev and vankov , 1997 ) .",
    "the probability depends on the photon energy and the angle between the photon and the earths magnetic field . for primary photons with @xmath600",
    "ev , the probability is large , partly because the magnetic field extends to much higher altitudes than the atmosphere .    because the atmospheric pressure , @xmath601 and @xmath602 decrease exponentially with height , it is convenient to use an exponential depth variable such as column density",
    ". column density is measured in g/@xmath598 , with ground level , @xmath603 at 1030 g/@xmath598 .",
    "then , @xmath604 234 pev , where @xmath605 is the depth in column density . similarly , @xmath606 and @xmath607 pev .",
    "because the atmosphere is much cooler at high altitudes , these numbers underestimate suppression by about 25% .",
    "they also neglect the fact that air is composed of diatomic @xmath595 and @xmath608 molecules ; when an electromagnetic interaction involves one atom of the molecule , the other atom will introduce additional multiple scattering over that expected from a monoatomic gas .",
    "this could be a significant effect , but it has yet to be studied .",
    "incoming photons react by pair production , while protons interact hadronically .",
    "a central hadronic collision will produce a shower of several hundred pions ; the neutral pions will decay to photons .",
    "the highest energy @xmath609 will have a rapidity near to the incoming proton , and their decay photons will have energies up to @xmath610 ev .",
    "many diffractive processes , such as @xmath611 production can also produce photons with similar energies .",
    "overall , photons from central interactions will have an average energy of about @xmath612 ev .",
    "above @xmath613 ev , the finite @xmath609 lifetime becomes important ( kasahara , 1996 ) ; a @xmath610 ev @xmath609 travels about 5 km before decaying and is likely to interact hadronically instead of decaying .",
    "this will reduce the number of high energy photons , reducing the significance of lpm suppression in the earliest part of the shower development .",
    "because both @xmath129 and the average particle energy , @xmath614 , decrease with depth , suppression mechanisms can actually become stronger as a shower moves deeper in the atmosphere .",
    "[ airdepth ] compares @xmath129 with @xmath614 for an idealized bethe - heitler shower from a @xmath594 ev photon . in each successive radiation length , there are twice as many particles with half the energy .",
    "the dashed line shows a similar cascade , from a @xmath610 ev photon starting at @xmath615 .",
    "the electromagnetic interactions at a given depth are determined by the ratio @xmath616 . for the photon shower , suppression is largest around 75 g/@xmath598 , where @xmath617 .",
    "electron @xmath146 is reduced about 80% , and pair production cross section is reduced by 60% ; @xmath93 has more than doubled . for hadronic showers ,",
    "the effect is smaller , and , of course , these high energy photons are only a small portion of the total shower . on the other hand ,",
    "since hadronic interactions are only partially inelastic , the proton may carry a significant fraction of its momentum deeper in the atmosphere , where suppression is larger .",
    "in general , at least part of the shower will be suppressed . because of the large shower to shower variations , it is difficult to give more quantitative estimates .",
    ".1 in    this simple model underestimates the importance of suppression .",
    "when suppression slows shower development , @xmath618 of the remainder of the shower will increase , increasing the suppression in the next radiation length .",
    "however , the model shows that suppression is very important in photon showers , and in at least parts of proton initiated showers . however , suppression is clearly less significant for proton showers than predicted by capdevielle and attallah ( 1992 ) .",
    "these estimates appear consistent with kalmykov , ostapchenko and pavlov ( 1995 ) and kasahara ( 1996 ) .",
    "fluctuations are also very important in air showers . because the cosmic ray energy spectrum falls as @xmath619 , it is important to understand the tails of the energy resolution distribution ; without accurate simulations , showers whose energy is overestimated can skew the measured spectrum .",
    "suppression mechanisms exacerbate the fluctuations , by greatly decreasing the number of interactions in the initial stage of the shower .",
    "for example , at sea level , a @xmath620 ev electron emits an average of 14 bremsstrahlung photons per @xmath93 , while a @xmath270 ev electron emits only 3 photons .",
    "pair creation is similarly affected ; pairs become more and more asymmetric .",
    "the result is that shower to shower fluctuations are much larger",
    ".    suppression also greatly reduces the number of particles in the early stages of a shower , eliminating most of the low energy fuzz. the lpm effect , dielectric suppression and pair conversion suppression all contribute to this reduction . although the lpm effect covers the widest range of energies , the other effects are stronger in the limited range in which they operate . for @xmath621 ,",
    "dielectric suppression reduces the number of bremsstrahlung photons with @xmath622 mev by two orders of magnitude .",
    "none of the current simulation efforts include these other mechanisms .",
    "even relatively late in the shower , there will be a reduction in the number of low energy particles .",
    "for example , where @xmath623 ev , the lpm effect suppresses photons below @xmath527500 mev .",
    "although a low energy cutoff does not affect the overall shower development , it can significantly reduce the number of particles early in the shower .",
    "this reduction may affect the shower profile observed by future air fluorescence detectors .    because @xmath129 drops as altitude decreases , suppression greatly increases the chance of photons penetrating deep in the atmosphere , even if the average interaction depth is nt too different . for trajectories where the probability of pair conversion in the magnetic field is small ,",
    "bethe - heitler and lpm predict similar average conversion depths for a @xmath594 ev shower , 114 and 122 g/@xmath598 respectively . however , migdal predicts that the photon has a 7% chance of surviving to a depth of 6@xmath93 , while bethe and heitler predict only a 0.25% survival probability at the same depth .",
    "these occasional deep interactions produce showers quite different from photons that convert higher in the atmosphere , and much more energy will reach the ground .",
    "although the magnitude is smaller , similar effects may be seen for the most energetic photons from proton interactions .",
    "there have also been searches for neutrino interactions with air deep in the atmosphere , producing nearly horizontal air showers . because the neutrino interaction cross section rises with energy ,",
    "this becomes especially attractive for very high energy neutrinos , @xmath624 ev ( capelle , 1998 ) .",
    "since these neutrino interactions occur at low altitudes , where @xmath129 is a few hundred pev , suppression is extremely important , especially at the higher energies .",
    "for example , a @xmath589 ev electron at sea level has a @xmath146 a factor of 10 lower than the bethe - heitler prediction .",
    "although suppression mechanisms may be of little importance to current cosmic ray studies , the next generation of experiments will reach both higher energies and higher statistics ( auger , 1996 , krizmanic , ormes and streitmatter , 1998 ) .",
    "although careful , detailed simulations are needed to reach definite conclusions , it appears that suppression mechanisms will affect the data collected .",
    "changes in shower energy deposition may also be important in the next generation of high energy and astrophysics detectors .",
    "this review will consider two examples , with a few representative numbers .",
    "direct cosmic ray composition measurements depend on measuring the cosmic ray charge and energy ; the latter in a calorimeter . because these experiments must be done above much of the atmosphere , either in balloon flights or space based experiments , calorimeter thickness is limited by the allowable weight .",
    "for example , the jacee collaboration has flown @xmath625 thick lead + emulsion / x - ray film calorimeters on long duration balloon flights ( parnell , 1989 ) . protons with energies up to 500 tev were observed .",
    "since a proton can be diffractively excited to a @xmath611 particle , which can decay @xmath626 , photons with energies up to about 7% of the proton energy , 35 tev , can be produced .",
    "figure [ suppressionvse ] shows that the location of the photon conversion point is not affected since 35 tev @xmath627 .",
    "however , the produced electrons and positrons will exhibit reduced energy loss , and overall energy leakage out of the back of the calorimeter may increase .",
    "the next generation of space based experiments will detect protons with energies well beyond 1 pev , with a consequently increased effect ( parnell , 1989 ) .    at the large hadron collider , now under construction at cern , electrons with energies up to about 1 tev will be produced .",
    "electron identification will be aided by a pre - shower radiator , which will separate electrons from hadrons by measuring the energy radiated in the first 2 or 3 @xmath93 of a lead calorimeter ( aspell , 1996 ) . because suppression reduces the number of photons emitted by the electron",
    ", electrons will behave more like heavier particles such as muons and pions . without suppression ,",
    "the number of photons emitted by a 1 tev electron in lead is infrared divergent : @xmath628 . for a detection cutoff @xmath629 mev ,",
    "this is 14 photons per radiation length .",
    "suppression reduces this to an average of 3 photons per radiation length .",
    "the small average number of photons increases the probability that the early stages of an electron shower will be indistinguishable from a muon or pion interaction .",
    "qcd analogs of the lpm effect involve quarks and gluons moving through a strongly coupling nuclear medium .",
    "because the nuclear medium is so dense , a quark or gluon moving through the medium typically undergoes many soft color exchange interactions , analogous to multiple scattering .",
    "because a nucleus is small , the formation length is often larger than the nucleus , so the nucleus acts as a single radiator .",
    "the literature on this subject is voluminous and this is not the place for a detailed review .",
    "instead , we will discuss a few examples , to illustrate the basic features of the interactions , and also to emphasize the both the similarities and the differences between the qed and qcd cases . because qcd couples strongly and is non - abelian , the theoretical calculations are much less robust , and the experimental data is much harder to interpret .      in hadronic interactions ,",
    "particle masses play a larger role than they do in electromagnetic interactions .",
    "suppression effects in hadronic interactions can be seen easily by considering the photoproduction of vector mesons , for example @xmath630 .",
    "this reaction is similar to @xmath235 , with a quark pair produced instead of a lepton pair .",
    "one difference is that the interaction between the quark pair and the nucleus is hadronic , rather than electromagnetic .",
    "the formation length for vector meson production is the same as for pair production , @xmath631 . for a 100 gev photon producing a @xmath377 , @xmath632 fm , far larger than the nuclear diameter .",
    "so , the photon / vector meson interacts with the nucleus as if it is a single particle , with the interactions determined by eq .",
    "( [ esigmashulga ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , qcd does not specify @xmath633 , but , in principle , this equation could be used to explore how the cross section depends on the nuclear thickness .",
    "another example where suppression effects can be important is low mass drell - yan dilepton production , @xmath634 . in the rest frame of the target nucleus",
    ", the incoming quark or antiquark can be thought of as pair producing the leptons .",
    "the momentum transfer from the target quark or antiquark can be small , so the formation zone can extend far outside the nucleus .",
    "more fundamental calculations involve quarks and gluons moving through a possibly very hot nucleus .",
    "one focus of recent calculations is the search for the quark gluon plasma ; a fast quark in a hadron gas ( normal nucleus ) may interact differently than one in a quark gluon plasma in which protons and neutrons are replaced by a sea of quarks and gluons .",
    "the sea of quarks and gluons , will have a longer screening length and a larger cross section , so quarks and gluons should lose energy considerably faster than in medium consisting of confined quarks and gluons .",
    "measurements of high energy jets ( or hadrons ) energy loss has been proposed as a tool for detecting the quark gluon plasma ( wang , huang and sarcevic , 1996 ) .",
    "it is instructive to consider bremsstrahlung energy loss ( @xmath146 ) by a quark with energy @xmath9 emitting gluons of energy @xmath42 in a nuclear medium .",
    "including the quark and gluon masses @xmath635 and @xmath636 ( srensen , 1992 ) @xmath637 unfortunately , the quark and gluon masses critically affect @xmath13 . besides bremsstrahlung",
    ", gluons can pair create quark anti - quark pairs , a close analog of pair production .",
    "because of the possibility of experimentally measuring jet or hadron energy loss discussed above , most calculations have focused on bremsstrahlung .",
    "srsensen ( 1992 ) repeated the landau and pomeranchuk semi - classical derivation , and also adapted migdal s formulae to quarks and gluons .",
    "although the results depend on @xmath635 and @xmath636 , and hence have large systematic errors , he did show that , for reasonable mass choices , suppression was important .",
    "this mass problem can be avoided because , for qcd , the gluon emission angle ( equivalent to @xmath52 is large , and eq .",
    "( [ lfwithms ] ) can be written as @xmath638 where @xmath639 is the perpendicular energy of the emitted gluon .",

    "they decomposed the incident hadron into a spectrum of fock states of varying masses , thereby avoiding the parton mass uncertainty .",
    "the resulting energy loss is limited by @xmath640 where @xmath641 gev@xmath642 , @xmath643 is the fractional energy of the produced parton and @xmath644 is the center of mass energy . here",

    "the target thickness is given by the nuclear radius , @xmath646 .",
    "however , surface effects are not included in the calculation .",
    "numerically , this energy loss should be negligible for reasonably high energy hadrons .",
    "wang , gyulassy and plmer ( 1995 ) did a detailed calculation of energy loss in a quark gluon plasma .",
    "they found that the radiation , while obeying the bound listed above , was very sensitive to the color screening distance in the plasma .",
    "the strength of the suppression depends on the ratio of the mean free path @xmath596 to the formation time @xmath564 , as with the qed plasma . when @xmath647 , @xmath648 where @xmath524 is the strong force coupling constant , @xmath649 is the square of the average momentum transfer from a single scattering , which should be proportional to @xmath650 , with @xmath263 the color screening mass . for quarks , the color factors @xmath651 and @xmath652 ,",

    "this probably explains the disagreement with brodsky and hoyer , who neglected surface effects .",
    "for high energy quarks ( @xmath658 ) created inside the nucleus , @xmath659 ; this dependence comes about because the quark takes some time to develop its gluon field ; this is analogous to the lower @xmath146 observed for newly created @xmath298 pairs . for quarks created at lower energies , where @xmath660 , the energy loss is proportional to the distance travelled , @xmath657 fm .",
    "r. baier and collaborators ( 1995 ) considered a fast quark or gluon propagating through nuclear matter . in an infinite medium ,",
    "the soft gluon spectrum matches their soft photon qed result ( r. baier  1996 ) , with @xmath661 .",
    "this differs from the logarithmic energy dependence found by wang , gyulassy and plmer .",
    "the difference is that this work included additional diagrams , such as the non - abelian 3-gluon vertices ; they note that these are the dominant source of emission . a later , expanded collaboration ( r. baier , 1997 ) considered a finite size quark gluon plasma and found the same energy dependencies as earlier , along with the same @xmath662 dependence found by zakharov . however , for lower energy emission , they find @xmath663 fm , much higher than brodsky and hoyer or zakharov .",
    "this is because zakharov includes additional diagrams in his calculation , and also treats hard gluons differently ( r. baier , 1998b ) .",
    "the collaboration has recently studied energy loss in a longitudinally expanding quark gluon plasma ( r. baier , 1998a ) .",
    "this is the first attempt to model a realistic , time varying temperature and density distribution that could occur when two heavy nuclei collide .    while the different calculations agree in many ways , there is still some significant disagreement .",
    "they generally agree about the appropriate energy scaling in the bethe - heitler ( no suppression ) and strong suppression regimes , and also show a good correspondence with the qed calculations .",
    "the disagreement is over where these two regimes apply .",
    "some of this stems from differing treatment of surface terms .",
    "some of it may stem from the details of the initial state used .",
    "whatever the cause , the numerical results vary greatly . unfortunately , because of the difficulty of clear experimental tests , it may be some time before data can choose the best result .",
    "future high energy electron - positron colliders will collide extremely dense beams of electrons and positrons . besides the desired hadronic interactions , large numbers of photons will be created .",
    "photon emission before the hadronic interaction lowers the average collision energy . also , some of the photons will pair convert , introducing a charged particle background into the detector .",
    "photons can be produced by coherent beamstrahlung , where a single particle interacts with the other beam as a whole , or by incoherent bremsstrahlung .",
    "because of the density of the plasma , multiple scattering , compton scattering and magnetic suppression can suppress some of these interactions .",
    "although suppression occurs for similar reasons as in bulk matter , many of the details are different because of the very different environment .",
    "both bremsstrahlung and pair creation are modified because bare charges are involved ; @xmath182 is governed by the size of the beams . for both , the magnetic fields produced by the opposing beam can have strong effects , and both bremsstrahlung and pair creation are significantly suppressed .",
    "( baier and katkov , 1973)(katkov and strakhovenko , 1977 ) , as is beamstrahlung .",
    "in contrast , because of the low density , lpm suppression is small in currently envisioned machines .",
    "dielectric suppression transfers over rather directly , after adjusting for the differing electron densities .",
    "it is in principle strong enough to cause significant suppression .",
    "however , because the beams are much shorter than @xmath13 , dielectric suppression is reduced , and of only marginal significance ( chen and klein , 1993 ) .",
    "theoretically , there has been much progress in the past few years , and several new approaches to lpm suppression have appeared .",
    "the problem of radiation from slabs , sets of foils and the like have all been considered for a wide range of kinematic factors . despite this , these calculations have some limitations .",
    "most only consider multiple scattering , and none cover the full range of suppression mechanisms .",
    "none cover pair production ; this may no longer be a trivial extension .",
    "finally , the high energy regime when bremsstrahlung and pair creation suppress each other needs to be explored .",
    "even if qed tests are not practical , this regime may be important for understanding the qcd case .",
    "more generally , none of the calculations consider higher order diagrams .    even in the absence of a unified approach ,",
    "a better treatment of dielectric suppression is of interest . to treat multi - gev bremsstrahlung with classical electromagnetism concepts like",
    "the dielectric constant of a medium is rather anachronistic .",
    "the dielectric constant comes from photons forward compton scattering off the electrons in the medium ; it would be very nice to see a calculation of dielectric suppression that uses compton scattering as a starting point ; such a calculation might yield some interesting surprises .",
    "all of these recent results need to be made generally accessible .",
    "a public program library would let experimenters compare the different approaches under a variety of conditions .",
    "many implications of the lpm effect are poorly appreciated , and there is a need to learn more about them .",
    "one ` lesson ' from slac - e-146 is that there is very little data on small @xmath23 bremsstrahlung , and consequently little theoretical attention to this area .",
    "of particular concern are radiative corrections to electromagnetic effects . besides the effect that suppressed bremsstrahlung will have on elastic scattering , little is know about when higher order terms become important .",
    "experimentally , there is a need to accurately measure suppression at higher energies , and to look at new phenomena .",
    "cosmic ray based experiments have poor statistics , and current accelerators only reach the semi - classical ( @xmath28 ) regime .",
    "ideally , a study of quantum bremsstrahlung would use electrons with @xmath666 tev for gold .",
    "an experiment at fermilab ( jones , 1993 ) with 250 gev electrons would be a significant step forward , but would not reach this goal .",
    "unfortunately , a tev electron beamline seems a long way off .",
    "however , because a relatively low flux is sufficient , it might be possible to use electrons and or photons produced in 14 tev @xmath667 collisions at lhc to study bremsstrahlung or pair production .",
    "suppression effects are large enough that they may also be observable in the lhc general purpose detectors .",
    "this is particularly likely in apparatus such as pre - shower radiators that look at early shower development .",
    "any future test of lpm or dielectric suppression must at least match e-146 in statistics , backgrounds and control of systematics .",
    "the statistics should be simple , but the backgrounds and systematics will require some effort .",
    "it will be necessary to minimize the magnetic fields in the bending magnets , photon angular acceptance , and backgrounds due to the beam transport system . with a higher energy beam ,",
    "it should also be possible to reduce the systematic errors , by avoiding the calorimetric transition region between energy deposition by compton scattering and by showering .",
    "it would also be very useful to collect data with a wider range of target thicknesses , and also more low @xmath43 targets . with an experiment accurate to 1 - 2%",
    ", it should be possible to compare the data with the recent theoretical predictions , assuming that the problems of multiple emission by a single electron can be handled properly , either theoretically or experimentally . while experiments with higher accuracy than e-146 are very desirable , improving the systematic errors by a large factor over e-146 would require extreme attention to detail .",
    "any new experiment should also investigate other phenomena , such as magnetic suppression . with @xmath668 , @xmath669 and magnetic suppression",
    "should be directly observable .",
    "studies in a constant magnetic field are probably the most interesting , but the effect of randomly ordered domains might also be observable . synchrotron radiation could be separated from bremsstrahlung by measuring targets of different density in a fixed magnetic field .",
    "a similar apparatus could measure emission from targets consisting of stacks of foils , to investigate transition radiation due to multiple scattering .",
    "it is desirable to try to push bremsstrahlung measurements to the smallest @xmath23 possible . as eq .",
    "( [ bkmag ] ) demonstrates , this is a new regime , and some surprises may await us .",
    "one tangible goal would be to reach the point where higher order corrections cause current theories to fail .",
    "there is currently considerable theoretical effort studying lpm - like phenomena in qcd . with the coming data on high energy heavy ion collisions from rhic ,",
    "this work will probably continue , with an increasing emphasis on ways to differentiate between suppression in a hadron gas and that of a quark gluon plasma .",
    "also , the current calculations are limited by their neglect of higher order terms , which are likely to be very important .",
    "experimentally , there is a clear need is for a convincing demonstration of suppression involving qcd .",
    "one place where more theoretical work is needed is to investigate suppression in astrophysical phenomena .",
    "one down - to - earth need is a detailed study of suppression in ehe cosmic ray air showers .",
    "other topics , less tied to specific experimental techniques , include the study of suppression in astrophysical regions of extreme density , temperature , and/or magnetic field .",
    "this review has discussed a few such areas , but there are many more .    between the new theoretical approaches and the expanding range of applications in qcd ,",
    "plasmas and astrophysics , suppression mechanisms seem destined to be a growing area of study over the coming years ,",
    "this review would not have been possible without much help .",
