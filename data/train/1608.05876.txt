    "deterministic chaos , discovered in the beginning of the 20th century , has been one of the basic subjects of interdisciplinary experimental , computational and theoretical research activity of the end of the 20th century .",
    "other similar topics include fractals , finite automata , cellular automata , solitons , linguistic dynamics , complex systems , ecosystems , anticipatory systems , general systems and computer assisted music [ bai - lin , 1994 ; nicolis , 1991 ; nicolis , 1995 ; schrder , 1991 ; schuster , 1984 ] .",
    "+ the theory of chaos is often highlighted as a theory of unpredictability , dynamical randomness , irregular and erratic behavior .",
    "symbolic dynamics has played an important role to chaos theory through kolmogorov - sinai entropy and kolmogorov - chaitin complexity .",
    "a decisive step in symbolic dynamics has been done in [ metropolis et al . , 1973 ] where a new algorithm coming from the world of combinatorics , the metropolis , stein and stein algorithm , has been used to generate and classify ( through an abstract ordering ) the symbolic dynamics of the superstable orbits of unimodal maps .",
    "this led mss to the universal sequence ( `` u - sequence '' ) , also referred to as `` structural universality '' in [ schuster , 1984].in a later step , one of the present authors ( k.k . ) and g. nicolis have shown that the symbolic dynamics at the accumulation points of the @xmath0 superstable orbits present self - similarity related to block - entropies .",
    "precise theorems have been established and the relations to fractals , turing machines ( finite automata ) , and transcendental number theory have been elucidated [ karamanos , 2001a ] . a careful popular review to the subject of symbolic dynamics and related topics has been given in a lecture note [ karamanos , 2000 ] .",
    "+ after important contributions by feigenbaum [ feigenbaum , 1978 ; feigenbaum , 1979 ] , and a wealth of related works the period - doubling root to chaos is by now well - understood .",
    "many authors have pointed out similar trends between the transition to the non - chaotic multifractal attractor ( also called feigenbaum attractor ) and the theory of second order phase transitions ( critical phenomena ) .",
    "a related question in this context is about the analytic form of the correlation function of the map .",
    "motivated by the call of [ ruelle , 1986 ] , j. nicolis and ebeling - nicolis important publications paved the road towards this direction [ nicolis & gaspard , 1994 ; ebeling & nicolis , 1991 ; ebeling & nicolis , 1992 ; freund et al . , 1996 ; nicolis et al . , 1983 ; rateitschak et al . ,",
    "however , this task had not yet been accomplished .",
    "after work by one of the present authors ( k.k . ) and g. nicolis [ karamanos & nicolis , 1999 ] it has been shown that in the basis of the metropolis , stein and stein ( mss ) algorithm , the symbolic dynamics at the feigenbaum point is universal , irrespectively of the detailed form of every unimodal map . from this viewpoint",
    "it is interesting to study another type of correlation function ( observable ) , namely the symbol - to - symbol correlation function for the logistic map . in this paper , we formulate in a systematic basis and calculate analytically all values of the symbol - to - symbol correlation function for the logistic map . + the self - similarity found by these authors , implies that the invariant measure lives on a fractal set , which further connects these results with work by grassberger and mandelbrot [ grassberger , 1986 ; karamanos & nicolis , 1999 ] in order to detect self - similarity of symbolic dynamics , had used a modified block - entropy , called `` block entropy by lumping '' .",
    "+ later on , [ karamanos , 2001b ; karamanos & kotsireas , 2002 ] has explored the limits of these methods , showing that block - entropy analysis by lumping could be used for the detection of finite automata in general .",
    "an entropy diagnostic for automaticity has been announced in the international conference casys 2000 in liege .",
    "generalizations of these results have circulated in a series of papers .",
    "a completely mechanized environment for large scale block entropy computations for arbitrary symbolic sequences has developed thanks to i. kotsireas , in maple .",
    "+ coming back now to the digital approach , from symbolic dynamics we form some new constants and the algebraic nature of these constants can be directly related to the lyapunov exponent of the chaotic map . in a first stage ,",
    "the proof uses a relatively recent theorem by [ allouche & zamboni , 1998 ] .",
    "however a general proof that automatic numbers are never algebraic irrational has seen the light of the day thanks to [ adamczewski & bugeaud , 2007 ] .",
    "these theorems opened the road to the constructions of `` super - universal '' constants for any unimodal maps .",
    "+ the study of correlation functions is the main subject of the present paper .",
    "the paper is articulated as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we present the part of the metropolis , stein and stein ( mss ) algorithm which gives the universal symbolic dynamics at the feigenbaum point of unimodal maps . in sec .",
    "3 the self - similarity properties of this symbolic dynamics under lumping are explored . in sec .",
    "4 we present the connection with gliding . in sec .",
    "5 we introduce the notion of the correlation functions . in sec . 6",
    "we accomplish our numerical experimentation . in sec .",
    "7 we propose the extraction of the values for the symbol - to - symbol correlation function at the accumulation point of the @xmath1 superstable cycles . in sec . 8",
    "we draw the main conclusions . in the next sec",
    "we introduce symbolic dynamics with particular emphasis to the symbolic dynamics at the feigenbaum point of unimodal maps .",
    "to produce symbolic dynamics out of the evolution of a given dynamical system we set up a coarse - grained description incorporating from the very beginning the idea that a physically accessible state corresponds to a finite region rather than to a single point of phase space .",
    "let v be the set of cells in phase space constituted by these regions assumed to be connected and non - overlapping .",
    "as time goes on the phase space trajectory performs transitions between cells thereby generating sequences of v symbols which may be regarded as the letters of an alphabet . + for unimodal maps , the coarse - graining can be done in a non - ambiguous ( `` canonical '' ) manner , so that it is useful to summarize some key properties of unimodal maps , defined as follows :    \\i .",
    "they are functions @xmath2 \\to [ 0,1]$ ] depending on a real parameter , @xmath3 , ( control parameter ) , + ii .",
    "@xmath4 is continuous and at least piecewise differentiable in [ 0,1 ] , + iii .",
    "@xmath4 is convex and has a unique maximum but is otherwise arbitrary .",
    "+ let c be the position of the maximum , that is , if @xmath5 if @xmath6 and @xmath7 if @xmath8 . a particular iterate ,",
    "@xmath9 will be said to be of 0or of l type and of 1or of r type , according to whether @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "given an initial condition,@xmath11 the minimum distinguishing information about the sequence of iterates @xmath9 will consist of a pattern of 0 s ( l s ) and 1 s ( r s ) .",
    "note that there are many possible ways to partition the phase space and many candidates as initial points .",
    "+ however , according to the julia theorem [ julia , 1918 ] , the partition @xmath12 \\cup ( c,1]$ ] and the initial point @xmath13 both turn out to be the most fruitful , from the point of view of the extraction of information available by the system .",
    "more specifically , the resulting coarse - grained path ( symbolic dynamics ) is in a one- to - one correspondence with the actual trajectory and , hence , there is no loss of information in the topological sense .",
    "we are thus in position to completely characterize the dynamical system as an information generator by examining its symbolic dynamics only.this is why this partition is called a generating one . for polynomial maps ,",
    "a stronger result called the fatou and julia theorem holds : for appropriate @xmath14 one can further localize the stable periodic orbits starting from the critical point c ( where @xmath15 ) and iterating it .",
    "+ based on this theoretical framework , one can develop a whole machinery for the construction of the patterns of the ( super)stable periodic orbits of any period .",
    "this task has been accomplished first in [ metropolis et al . , 1973 ] for finite limit sets and",
    "later completed in [ derrida et al . , 1978 ] , in order to include infinite limit sets . in view of the particular importance of the period - doubling route to chaos",
    ", several authors tried to examine the symbolic dynamics of the corresponding attractors and this task has been achieved in [ karamanos & nicolis , 1999 ] on a systematic basis .",
    "+ let p be the pattern ( an abreviation of the symbolic trajectory ) associated with the superstable orbit of period - m ( briefly called here m - period ) . by definition ,",
    "the ( first)harmonic of p is the pattern , @xmath16 where @xmath17=l if p contains an odd number of r s and @xmath17=r otherwise .",
    "the procedure can be iterated , so that one may speak of the second , third , @xmath18 , j - th harmonic , etc .",
    ", hereafter denoted as @xmath19 .",
    "mss also introduce the @xmath20-extension of a pattern p as the pattern p generated by iterating the harmonic construction applied j times to p , when j increases indefinitely . in the sequel",
    ", we shall rather adopt the notation @xmath21 for this asymptotic pattern .",
    "+ mss prove that , if p is allowed , @xmath22 allowed too ( their theorem 1 ) .",
    "furthermore , in their universal ordering , we have @xmath23 and the harmonics are adjacent , that is , no allowed sequence exists between p and @xmath22 . upon iterating the process :    @xmath24    for later use , we list hereafter the first few harmonics associated with the @xmath1 superstable cycles .    the @xmath25 cycle , is given by : +   + @xmath26 + the logistic map is the archetype of a complex system .",
    "let us elaborate .",
    "we introduce the logistic map in its familiar form :    @xmath27    for the logistic map in this form the generating partition is easily computed , following the above - mentioned argument dating back to the french mathematician gaston julia .",
    "to be more specific , for @xmath28 the equation @xmath15 gives c=0.5 so that the partition of the phase space ( which in this case is the unit interval i=[0,1 ] ) l=[0,0.5 ] and r=(0.5,1 ] is a generating partition .",
    "as it has been already pointed out the information content of the symbolic trajectory is the `` minimum distinguishing information '' in the words of metropolis et al .",
    "needless to say , in this representation the logistic map is viewed as an abstract information generator .",
    "for both reasons of completeness and for later use we compile here some results first presented in [ karamanos & nicolis , 1999 ] .",
    "in particular we establish certain invariance and self - similarity properties of the symbolic sequences associated to the @xmath25 attractors . taking advantage of these properties ,",
    "we then introduce a scheme mapping the original sequence into a new sequence of hypersymbols with well - defined statistical properties obtained by the lumping of groups of original symbols .",
    "+ we define an operator , @xmath29 , in the space of @xmath1 sequences ( that is for the `` patterns '' having the form @xmath30 ) through the following action which , in a sense , is inverse to that of the harmonic operator ( we first fix a pattern @xmath31 ) :    \\i ) cut the last r of the pattern p ( which necessarily ends by r and has an odd number of symbols ) ,    \\ii ) in the remaining part of the pattern , perform the lumpings : @xmath32 starting from the first r of the pattern from the left . choosing @xmath33 one",
    "can then show that    @xmath34    taking the limit , @xmath35 in this relation , we have : @xmath36 showing that the action of @xmath37 leaves the @xmath25 sequence invariant.the passage to this limit is essentially equivalent to the existence of accumulation points and its validity is established , for instance in [ feigenbaum , 1978 ; feigenbaum , 1979 ] and in another context , in [ daems & nicolis , 1994 ] .",
    "actually this self - similarity property can be extended straightforwardly to guarantee invariance under a repetitive use of the operator @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 as long as n is finite . as an example , consider the subsequence rlrrrlrl , which is part of the symbolic trajectory . applying the rule twice",
    ", one obtains , successively , rlrr and rl , as stipulated , precisely , in step ( ii ) .",
    "notice that this reduction would be inapplicable , had the sequence been read by gliding one symbol each time .",
    "+ in this way , we have explored the symmetries of the harmonic operator .",
    "we shall now show that one can take profit of these symmetries to generate the whole sequence .",
    "indeed , we now express the period - doubling symbolic sequence as a sequence generated by substitutions instead of being fixed point of the harmonic operator . to this end",
    ", we introduce the morphism ( substitution rule ) @xmath39 , defined as : @xmath40 and we observe that : @xmath41 by repetitive use of the above equation we find @xmath42[{({{\\mathop{\\rm re}\\nolimits } ^ { - 1}})^{n - 1}}(r)] ... [{{\\mathop{\\rm re}\\nolimits } ^ { - 1}}(r)]r}\\ ] ] taking now the limit of this relation when @xmath43 we find asymptotically : @xmath44 which is the desired relation , as it expresses the @xmath25 feigenbaum sequence as the fixed point of the morphism @xmath39 ( eq . ( 6 ) ) which is of constant length 2 .",
    "operationally this guarantees that the successive replacements :    @xmath45    generate indeed in each step the first part of the @xmath25 sequence .",
    "due now to a theorem by a. cobham , a sequence generated by a set of substitution rules of length m , one for each letter ( morphism ) can be in an equivalent manner generated by a deterministic finite automaton ( the lowest order turing machine ) with m - states .",
    "( this is why the term `` automatic '' ) .",
    "+ we next proceed to reproduce the explicit evaluation of the probability mass of the symbols r and l. according to the mss algorithm , the number of letters of a permissible word increase from construction steps @xmath46 to @xmath47 as @xmath48 ( with @xmath49 ) .",
    "the solution of this recurrence is @xmath50 . on the other hand for the number of r s , one has ( @xmath51 )    @xmath52",
    "whose solution is :    @xmath53,}\\ ] ]    it follows that the fraction of r s is :    @xmath54}}{{{2^\\nu } - 1 } } } \\right ) = \\frac{2}{3}}\\ ] ]    in other words , the _ a priori _ probabilities of r and l in a long sequence are :    @xmath55    in the next section we shall establish the connection with gliding .",
    "in [ karamanos & nicolis , 1999 ] , it has been shown that one can reduce , the study of the occurrence of words of an even length to the study of words of an odd length , when reading starts from the beginning of the sequence . the main idea for",
    "this computation is to explicitly write down effective transition probabilities from first principles .",
    "we shall reproduce briefly the idea exposed in [ karamanos & nicolis , 1999 ] and give some examples .",
    "+ the above analysis also provides information on the transition probability matrix of the ( coarse - grained ) state vector .",
    "for instance , in the case of the @xmath25 sequence , there is no @xmath56 transition , and the @xmath57 or @xmath58 transitions are equally frequent .",
    "the 1-step transition matrix is thus    @xmath59    suppose we begin with a symbol r , randomly chosen on the @xmath60 sequence .",
    "this has a probability 2/3 to happen .",
    "the next symbol has 1/2 probability to be an r and equal probability to an l , in view of the 1-step transition matrix eq.(14 ) .",
    "for the next step , we have the following , keeping in mind the replacement rules of eq.(6 ) :    \\i ) the configuration , rr has a probability 1/2 to continue as rrr and a probability 1/2 to continue as rrl .",
    "+ ii ) the configuration , rl , continues certainly ( with probability 1 ) with r , to form rlr , as we already know from eq .",
    "( 14 ) .",
    "if the subsequence begins now with an l , the situation is slightly more complicated .",
    "we first observe that the operator @xmath61 introduced as a kind of inverse of the harmonic operator previously , is not uniquely defined .",
    "one could , for instance , define an operator @xmath62 which cuts the first r of the pattern , @xmath63 and performs the replacements , @xmath64 to the rest of the sequence .",
    "then it is easy to show that @xmath62 is also a ( partial ) inverse of @xmath20 entailing that , in the case of subsequences which start with an l , self - similarity is manifested with ( new ) hypersymbols formulated under the replacements @xmath65.if we begin so with an l , this has a probability 1/3 to happen .",
    "for the next symbol , we are certain that it will be r ( from eq .",
    "( 14 ) ) , to form lr .",
    "the latter configuration has a probability of 1/2 to continue as lrr and an equal probability , 1/2 , to continue as lrl .",
    "locally , one can also use the conclusions of the previous section as , for instance , the recurrence time distribution : a configuration @xmath18lrr will continue , with certainty , with an r. + to conclude , we thus have five words of length three : three words starting with an r , namely rrr , rrl and rlr , with corresponding frequencies of occurrence , 1/6 , 1/6 , and 1/3 , respectively , and two words starting with an l , namely lrr and lrl , with corresponding frequencies of occurrence , 1/6 and 1/6 , respectively .",
    "+ excluding configurations which do not obey the basic requirement of self - similarity , we proceed like this _ ad infinitum_. fig .",
    "2 also illustrates this point .",
    "this procedure allows to write down all the words of an odd length encountered when gliding on the @xmath25 sequence , as well as their frequencies . using the effective n - step ( gliding ) transition probabilities just introduced , we are in the position to write down explicitly the entropies for words of an odd length in a constructive manner ( that is , step - by - step ) . in the next section",
    "we introduce the main concern of this paper , different types of correlation functions .",
    "first of all we define the correlation function of the trajectory as :    @xmath66    in direct analogy with the un - normalized correlation function we also introduce here the normalized correlation function : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the mean standard deviation",
    ".    from these definitions follows that @xmath69 yields another measure for the irregularity of the sequence of iterates @xmath11 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 @xmath18.it tells us how much the deviations of the iterates from their average value , @xmath72 that are m steps apart ( i. e. , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) `` know '' about each other , on the average .",
    "if @xmath75 as @xmath35 then the system does not have the mixing property .",
    "the problem of determining the correlation function of an arbitrary dynamical system is intractable in the general case .",
    "this is the reason to resort to other computable observables such as the symbol - to - symbol correlation function [ daems & nicolis , 1994 ] .",
    "+ so , in analogy with the correlation function of the trajectory we can introduce the symbol - to - symbol correlation function as :    @xmath76    where @xmath77=0,1 when @xmath78 or @xmath79 respectively and    @xmath80    in the same way we can define the normalized symbol - to - symbol correlation function    @xmath81",
    "motivated by previous work on correlation functions [ daems & nicolis , 1994 ; ruelle , 1986 ] , we explore here numerically the properties of the symbol - to - symbol correlation function . + in order to cope with the problem of the analytic form of correlation functions we stalled certain number of numerical experiments . for the logistic map at the feigenbaum point",
    "r=3.56994567@xmath18 we have calculated the un - normalized symbol - to - symbol correlation function for @xmath82 iterations ( we eliminated the first @xmath83 iterations to avoid transients ) , starting from the initial point @xmath84 as also stated in [ karamanos & nicolis , 1999 ] , exactly at the feigenbaum point the lyapunov exponent strictly vanishes @xmath85= 0 .",
    "+ we now turn back to the structure of the un - normalized symbol - to - symbol correlation function as it is found numerically for @xmath82 iterations ( this scheme is depicted in fig.2 ) :",
    "@xmath86    in a more compact form we can announce the following empirical rule for the symbol - to - symbol correlation function ( observable ) :    @xmath87    where for a given ( fixed ) r , @xmath88 , @xmath89 is a constant depending only on r , and k takes all the values from the set of natural numbers @xmath90 . as we will show in section 7",
    "one can determine the constants @xmath89 from first principles .",
    "+ as a final comment we observe that according to our computations that for @xmath91 the correlation function ( @xmath92 ) approaches the value 2/9 .",
    "the first @xmath83 iterations have been eliminated in order to exclude transients , and the subsequent @xmath82 iterations have been taken into account for the calculations .",
