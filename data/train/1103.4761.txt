    "<S> these results are surprising and challenge our understanding of the magnetic interaction in perovskites . in particular they pose three fundamental questions : i ) is the origin of such a large magnetic ordering temperature related to the strong tc 4@xmath3-o @xmath12 hybridization ? , ii ) what is the role played by the structural degrees of freedom ? and </S>",

    "<S> these unexpectedly large magnetic ordering temperatures can be understood in the framework of anderson s theory of se interactions  @xcite , which links the strength of the se coupling constant with the actual hybridization between the metal and the mediating atom , and van vleck s theory of antiferromagnetism  @xcite , which connects the strength of the se interaction with the magnetic ordering temperature . </S>",

    "<S> the calculated density of states ( dos ) displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] shows that these huge @xmath38 value arises from the strong covalency between the tc @xmath26 and o @xmath12 orbitals evolving along the wide 4@xmath3 @xmath26 manifold , in particular for the topmost valence states spreading from -1.5/2  ev to the fermi level ( @xmath55 ) . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we recall , that the most significant effects on the crystal structure caused by increasing @xmath40 are ( i ) the volume enhancement , ( ii ) the quenching of the jt distortions q@xmath34 and q@xmath2 and ( iii ) the decrease of the cooperative rotation of the tco@xmath6 octahedra represented by the @xmath41 bond angles . </S>",
    "<S> the angles @xmath60 and @xmath61 are crucial quantities to explain the evolution of the se interactions and of the magnetic ordering temperature . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the monotonic increase of the @xmath41 bond angles ( in brief the average between @xmath60 and @xmath61 , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3 ] ) leads to the progressive rectification of the nn superexchange paths . </S>",
    "<S> this generates , in a tight - binding framework , an enhanced tc-@xmath26/o-@xmath12 hybridization , as confirmed by the dos ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : fig2 ] ) . as displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3 ] , @xmath11 steeply increases from catco@xmath2 ( 750  k ) to srtco@xmath2 ( 1135  k ) as a consequence of the observed larger change in @xmath41 , which goes from 151@xmath62 to 167@xmath62 . when moving from srtco@xmath2 to batco@xmath2 ( 1218  k ) </S>",
    "<S> the rise of @xmath11 is weaker due to a smaller change of @xmath41 ( from 167@xmath62 to 179@xmath62 ) and to a further reduction and sign change in @xmath39 . in analogy with the rmno3 perovskites , </S>",
    "<S> the increase of @xmath11 for larger tc - o - tc angles correlates with a progressive reduction of the jt dis- tortions ( i.e. a decrease of the associated structural ordering tempera- ture).@xcite    in conclusion we remark that our findings for the 4@xmath3 @xmath1tco@xmath2 series are consistent with the goodenough - kanamori rules  @xcite and follow the general trend observed in 3@xmath3 @xmath1mno@xmath2 , namely that @xmath11 increases by increasing the @xmath41 angles . </S>",
    "<S> the remarkably different @xmath11 s in manganites ( @xmath63  150  k ) and technetiates ( @xmath64  750  k ) can be explained with the reduced spatial extension of 3@xmath3 shell , which suppresses the @xmath3-@xmath12 hybridization in manganites and thereby inhibits strong se interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we also emphasize , that the correct description of this complex class of materials can be only achieved within a beyond - local functional method such as hse . </S>",
    "<S> hse is capable of capturing the delicate balance between the se mechanism and both , the hund s coupling ( unlike local functionals , hse provides well defined magnetic solutions for different spin configurations ) and the intra - atomic coulomb repulsion ( though substantially reduced with respect to 3@xmath3 perovskites , on site coulomb interaction survives in 4@xmath3 technetiates and contributes to the formation of a rather large gap which local functionals seriously underestimates ) . </S>"
