    "raman laser coupling schemes have already led to the experimental realization of one - dimensional spin - orbit coupling ( equal mixture of rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling )  @xcite and two - dimensional spin - orbit coupling  @xcite .",
    "this paper considers isotropic three - dimensional spin - orbit coupling .",
    "while this type of spin - orbit coupling has not yet been realized experimentally in cold atom systems , several proposals exist toward its experimental realization  @xcite .",
    "the two - particle scattering framework developed in our work for systems with short - range interactions is related to scattering works for electronic systems with spin - orbit coupling . in the context of electronic systems ,",
    "the negative energy regime , which is the focus of our work , has not received as much attention as the positive energy regime  @xcite .",
    "thus , we expect our developments to not only be of interest to the cold atom community but also to the condensed matter community .",
    "spin - orbit coupled cold atom systems are currently of great interest to experimentalists and theorists . to date a variety of exciting single - particle based phenomena such as landau - zener transitions  @xcite , zitterbewegung oscillations  @xcite , and spin wave dynamics  @xcite",

    "coupled systems , unlike in the alkalis , the singlet and triplet channels are strongly coupled , giving rise to changes of the two - body binding energy and the crossover physics in fermi gases  @xcite . while the experimental study of these effects is still in its infancy , first radio - frequency studies of weakly - bound feshbach molecules reveal that the spin - orbit coupling terms have an appreciable effect  @xcite . in a different experiment ,",

    "the interplay between the two - body interactions and the single - particle spin - orbit coupling terms also leads to interesting few - body effects .",

    "the effect can be traced back to an effective reduction of the dimensionality due to the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "while this effective dimensionality reduction is well known and appreciated  @xcite , its impact on threshold laws has , to the best of our knowledge , not been discussed in detail in the literature .",

    "since the derivative of the single particle energies with respect to @xmath56 for systems with isotropic spin - orbit coupling shows a discontinuity at vanishing energy [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] , the extension of the framework developed in refs .  @xcite to negative energies is not entirely straightforward .",
    "one approach would be to obtain solutions for the various energy regions separately and to then match the solutions .",
    "alternatively , and this is the route pursued in this paper , one might seek solutions that apply to all energy regions . to this end",
    ", we replaced @xmath56 by @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and defined single - particle energies whose derivative with respect to @xmath64 is continuous for all energies [ see figs .",

    "our formulation allows us to treat the various scattering thresholds and energy variations across these thresholds using standard coupled - channel formulations .",
    "specifically , this opens the door for calculating energy - dependent or thermally averaged scattering cross sections by making modifications to existing propagation based scattering codes .",
    "we applied our framework to the @xmath5 and @xmath6 channels for two particles , with equal or unequal masses , interacting through the zero - range @xmath0-wave pseudo - potential . assuming @xmath0-wave contact interactions , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels are the only channels affected by the two - body interactions , i.e.",
    ", the behavior of the @xmath254 channels is independent of @xmath4 . if we , e.g. , take the state @xmath255 as our initial state",
    ", the population of the @xmath256 partial wave channels is three times higher than that of the @xmath1 partial wave channel .",
    "if we take an equal mixture of @xmath255 and @xmath257 as our initial state , then the population of the @xmath256 partial wave channels is six times higher than that of the @xmath1 partial wave channel .",
    "while this paper did not report total cross sections , the above statements give a feeling for how to convert the partial wave cross sections presented in this paper to total cross sections .",
    "we obtained closed analytical expressions applicable to all energies for the partial wave cross sections .",
    "the behavior of the partial cross sections was analyzed in detail near the scattering thresholds .",
    "particular attention was paid to the scattering thresholds located at negative energies and simple analytical results were reported for the limiting behaviors .",
    "while our results were obtained for a specific functional form of the spin - orbit coupling and specific scattering channels , we believe that our study points toward more general characteristics of two - body scattering in the presence of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "first , the partial cross sections for scattering between states corresponding to a branch that becomes closed at a particular negative energy scattering threshold are  at the scattering threshold ",
    "independent of the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath4 and fully determined by the spin - orbit coupling strength @xmath3 .",
    "this universal behavior can be interpreted as being a consequence of an effective dimensionality reduction near the scattering thresholds . at the lowest scattering threshold , all partial wave",
    "cross sections , and hence also the total cross section , are independent of @xmath4 .",
    "second , the mass ratio dependence of the results in the @xmath6 channels points toward an interesting tunability of few- and many - body properties of mass imbalanced systems . it is easily recognized that the scattering threshold where branch b becomes closed depends on the mass ratio . since a subset of the partial cross sections vanishes at this threshold",
    ", different mass ratios should result in different energy dependent cross sections .",
    "moreover , the two - body binding energy was found to depend on the mass ratio .",
    "the present paper suggests a variety of follow - up studies .",
    "most immediately , it would be interesting to extend our theoretical framework to systems with finite total momentum or with other types of spin - orbit coupling",
    ". moreover , it would be interesting to incorporate the formulation presented in this paper into a two - body scattering code and to investigate the influence of two - body van der waals physics on scattering observables in the presence of spin - orbit coupling .",
