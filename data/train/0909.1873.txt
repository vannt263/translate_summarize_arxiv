    "the emerging field of quantum optics has established a demand for an accessible solid state system which can generate a stream of single photons on demand @xcite .",
    "although single photon emission has been demonstrated from quantum dots ( qd ) @xcite , single molecules @xcite and nanowires@xcite , the operation of those systems is often limited by the temperature .",
    "diamond crystals , on the other hand , offer the most promising platform for generation of robust , photo stable , single photons at room temperature @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , out of more than 500 existing optical centers in diamond @xcite , only three known centers demonstrate single photon emission , namely , the nitrogen - vacancy complex @xcite , the silicon - vacancy complex @xcite and the nickel - nitrogen complex @xcite .",
    "recent progress in materials science and fabrication techniques of diamond color centers @xcite unveiled novel quantum emitters operating in the mhz regime @xcite .",
    "these new centers , are comparable to qd in terms of brightness @xcite , but have the tremendous advantage of stable operation at room temperature .",
    "these break throughts have opened a new avenue to investigate essentially an unknown group of single photon emitters in diamond .",
    "the simple two - level nature of a select few single photon emitters allows a direct estimate of the collection efficiency associated with the optical setup , the precise knowledge of the collection efficiency can lead to more accurate estimations of the quantum efficiency of the more common three level single photon emitting systems .",
    "this type of source can thus eventually be used as a reference for an absolute characterization of the quantum efficiency along with more precise estimations of the collection efficiency of the system , provided the photo - physics is well understood .",
    "one can envisage that single photon sources could be implemented as a `` single photon standard '' , able to link classical radiometric measurements to the fundamental quantum optical entities .",
    "in particular in the long term such a single photon standard could contribute to a re - definition of the standard units for optical radiation in terms of the `` quantum candela '' @xcite .",
    "the controlled fabrication of the mhz class of diamond single photon emitters , together with a recent emission enhancement by coupling the light to plasmonic structures @xcite or cavities @xcite , is expected to progress the technology beyond the point in which they can become practical quantum information and metrology devices .    in this paper ,",
    "a detailed study of the photophysical properties of the novel family of single photon emitters reported in @xcite has been undertaken .",
    "to gain insight into the electronic level structure of the emitters , their fundamental optical properties such as lifetime , photo - luminescence ( pl ) spectrum , sub - poissionian statistics and saturation count rate have been studied and compared .",
    "we concentrate on the typical pl lines in the range of 740 - 770 nm , which exhibit single photon emission with count rates ranging from 1.3 - 3.2 @xmath0 counts / s at saturation .",
    "the physics of the photoluminescence emitted from a single diamond color center can be described within the framework of a two level system comprising a ground and excited state , and in many instances as a three - level system @xcite , whereby the single center is excited from its ground state to the excited state , with a third longer lived state providing an additional decay path from the excited state , as seen in fig .",

    "an analytical expression describing the second order correlation function can be obtained .",

    "there is a clear distinction in the shape and nature of the exponential component . in the two level case",
    "the function exhibits a simple exponential rise at a rate equivalent to the fluorescence decay rate of the excited state in the limit of zero optical excitation i.e. @xmath25 , with the exponential asymptotic to a g@xmath26(@xmath27 ) value of 1 .",
    "the three level expression , on the other hand , contains two exponential components each with a characteristic time constant . depending on the transition rates from the excited state to the shelving state and shelving state back to the ground state ,",
    "g@xmath26(@xmath27 ) can increase beyond 1 for times @xmath28 , before decaying back to 1 at times @xmath29 .",
    "the phenomenon of g@xmath26(@xmath27)>1 is commonly termed  photon bunching \" and this behavior enables a clear distinction to be made between two and three level systems .",
    "the second order correlation function describes the probability of detecting a photon with a delay time @xmath27 after one photon has been detected at @xmath27=0 .",
    "hence , the bunching effect describes the enhanced probability to detect a photon at short times then at longer times .",
    "indeed after the system undergoes a transition to its shelving state , which has longer lifetime , there is a longer interval between the photons .",
    "once the system relaxed to the ground state and undergo a full emission cycle again , the normal photon rate is achieved again .",
    "the waiting interval while the system in the metastable state thus creates the bunching effect of the g@xmath26(@xmath27 ) .",
    "the measurement g@xmath26(@xmath27 ) is done typically using a hanbury - brown and twiss ( hbt ) interferometer whereby the coincidence events of two detectors are measured . in practice ,",
    "the temporal jitter of the detectors and of the electronics can be ignored provided that the lifetime is much longer than the temporal jitter ; with the identification of emitting centers with increasing short fluorescence lifetimes @xcite , the effect of the temporal jitter on the measured auto - correlation function @xmath30 must be taken into account .",
    "therefore the measured auto - correlation function is given by the convolution of eqs ( [ g2 eq1],[g2 eq2 ] ) with the instrumental time response function @xmath31 : @xmath32 + the majority of single photon emitters identified in diamond ( such as : si - v @xcite , nv @xcite and the ne8@xcite ) have been attributed to three level systems which suffer from quenching due to the presence of a shelving state .",
    "however , the recent identification of highly efficient two level systems in diamond @xcite has attracted considerable interest , particularly due to its central role in determining more accurately the collection efficiency of the setup and the quantum efficiency of three level systems .",
    "the quantum efficiency , @xmath33 , of an emitter is defined as the probability of an absorbed pump photon resulting in emitted photon .",
    "for a two level emitter , the quantum efficiency is equal to 1 when @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 , indicating that for each absorbed pump photon a photon is emitted from the excited state .",

    ", an average value of @xmath41=1.3% is obtained .",
    "the discrepancy in the value of collection efficiency for various two level emitters may be attributed to a variation in @xmath77 due to the unknown dipole orientation of the emitter within the crystal and/or residual polarisation dependent background , that can influence the total saturation count rate @xmath64 .",
    "the accuracy of @xmath77 can be improved by engineering centers with a known dipole orientation and lower fluorescent background .",
    "a detailed analysis of the various parameters of the collection efficiency , which is beyond the scope of the paper , is however important to exploit fully the two - level system properties for improving measurement accuracy . after identifying the collection efficiency @xmath41=1.3% ,",
    "the quantum efficiency @xmath33=0.24 of the 749 nm emitter is derived from the fit to the saturation curve with eq.(9 ) .",
