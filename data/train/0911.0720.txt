    "if s0 galaxies did not exist it is possible that they would not have been missed .",
    "late type , star - forming galaxies including spirals are expected in early galactic evolution and elliptical galaxies are thought to form by mergers among these ancient late type galaxies or , at a later stage , from dry mergers with each other .",
    "s0 or lenticular galaxies are differentiated from these more predictable and recognizable galaxies by being generally structureless with stellar bulges and rotating disks having light distributions that are somewhat less concentrated than in ellipticals .",
    "the distinction between e and s0 morphologies is not always easy , particularly when s0s are viewed face - on .",
    "this classification difficulty has resulted in the notion of e - s0 galaxies where the uncertain type may either be an intrinsic reality or a consequence of the limitations of the astronomical classifier .",
    "s0s are often a nuisance in large surveys since the s0-e distinction decreases with redshift and the two types of galaxies are often combined",
    ".    however , many local s0 galaxies are quite distinct from ellipticals , particularly as a result of their significant gas content , star formation rates , and optical colors . at infrared wavelengths many s0 galaxies",
    "exhibit a range of unusual properties not often found in ellipticals .",
    "recently we discussed the infrared properties of 34 s0 and e galaxies in the sauron sample that have also been observed in the infrared with the spitzer telescope ( temi , brighenti & mathews 2009 ; hereafter tbm09 ) .",
    "this relatively small spitzer - sauron sample is useful since sauron galaxies have been intensively observed at many other wavelengths . while the infrared emission from some s0 galaxies in the spitzer - sauron sample closely resembles gas - free elliptical galaxies , many s0 galaxies contain rotationally supported kpc - sized disks of star - forming cold gas ( e.g. combes , young & bureau 2007 ; young .",
    "bendo & lucero 2009 ) and dust that emit more strongly in spitzer bandpasses than ellipticals .",
    "the star formation rates in s0s in the spitzer - sauron sample , derived from their 24@xmath1 m emission , are small , @xmath3 @xmath4 yr@xmath5 , but correlate with the magnitude of the h@xmath6 spectral index produced by relatively young a - f stars ( tbm09 ) . however , in sauron s0 galaxies we found that star formation rates estimated from balmer emission line luminosities are often much less than star formation rates found from 24@xmath1 m emission .",
    "the insufficient emission line evidence for ob stars is curious since slightly less massive young stars are often visible . in any case ,",
    "hydrogen line emission is easily absorbed by dust , so estimates of star formation rates in s0 galaxies are probably more reliably determined from 24@xmath1 m dust emission or by a combination of @xmath7 and infrared luminosities ( kennicutt et al .",
    "2009 )    in this paper we discuss infrared spitzer observations of a much larger , more comprehensive sample of e and s0 galaxies taken from the spitzer archive .",
    "this extended sample reveals some remarkable attributes of s0 galaxies .",
    "most important of these is a very narrow correlation between colors formed by ratios of mid and far - infrared spitzer luminosities with @xmath2-band luminosities in which the dust properties differentiate many but not all s0s from gas - free e galaxies .",
    "furthermore , it is remarkable that the color - color correlation for s0s is nearly identical to that of normal galaxies spanning all morphological types .",
    "although ancillary data is less abundant for this extended sample of early - type galaxies than for the sauron - spitzer sample , the mass of neutral and molecular hydrogen is known for many of them and this provides several interesting comparisons with star formation rates based on their spitzer 24@xmath1 m luminosities .",
    "table 1 contains relevant information about our extended sample of elliptical and lenticular galaxies found from the spitzer archives .",
    "we searched the archives to select early - type galaxies within a distance of 30 mpc that have been observed with spitzer at far infrared wavelengths .",
    "about 60 more distant galaxies have been added from known spitzer observing programs and by querying large lists of early - type galaxies known from other surveys .",
    "of the 225 galaxies in table 1 , 121 are ellipticals , 26 are e - s0 and 76 are s0 .",
    "two galaxies have uncertain classification ( ngc 3656 and ngc 5666 ) .",
    "ngc 5666 was classified as an elliptical in early studies by nilson ( 1973 ) and lake et al .",
    "recently donzelli & davoust ( 2003 ) found evidence of spiral structures from deep ccd images , suggesting a late type sc galaxy .",
    "however photometric analysis indicates a number of contradictory morphological properties that point toward a classification of an early type disk galaxy which has accreted a gas rich dwarf galaxy during a minor merger event .",
    "ngc 3656 is classified as ( r)i0 : pec by ned .",
    "its morphological classification is not reported in the hyperleda catalog , and is listed as non - magellanic irregular in rc2 catalog . from near infrared photometry , wiklind , combes & henkel ( 1995 ) classify ngc3656 as a disturbed elliptical with an envelope of faint shells and a dust lane .",
    "they point out that it could be also considered a face - on s0 .",
    "none of our results changes if these two galaxy are removed from the sample .",
    "this table also includes all early - type galaxies in our proprietary spitzer observations ( temi , brighenti & mathews 2007 , hereafter tbm07 ) as well as early - type sauron galaxies observed with spitzer and discussed in tbm09 .",
    "all but four galaxies in table 1 are massive or relatively massive , i.e. @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "table 1 contains flux densities and specific luminosities @xmath10 at 24 , 70 and 160@xmath1 m .",
    "the fir data presented here were obtained with the multiband imaging photometer ( mips ; rieke et al .",
    "2004 ) on board the spitzer space telescope ( sst ; werner et al .",
    "2004 ) in three wavebands centered at 24 , 70 , and 160@xmath1 m . these data , collected from the spitzer public archive ,",
    "do not form a homogeneous and uniform data set in terms of image depth and observing mode .",
    "column 2 of table 1 lists the program identification ( i d ) and principal investigator ( pi ) for the various original spitzer observing programs from which our sample galaxies are selected .",
    "the reader is referred to these programs to obtain details on the observing modes and imaging strategy , as well as the on - source integration time for each target in the sample . as an example ,",
    "virgo cluster galaxies recorded under the guaranteed time program ( pid 69 , pi g. fazio ) reach a relatively low sensitivity of 0.5 mjy sr@xmath5 and 1.1 mjy sr@xmath11 ( 1@xmath12 ) at 70 and 160@xmath1 m , respectively , while other galaxies ( i.e. , pid 20171 , pi p. temi ) have deeper maps at a sensitivity level of only 0.12 mjy sr@xmath13 and 0.3 mjy sr@xmath14 for the same two wavebands . the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings ) data are recorded in mips scan mode , covering a very large sky area ( @xmath15 ) , incorporating two separated passes at each source location .",
    "sings images correspond to maps with intermediate sensitivity .",
    "apart from the sings observations , data have been acquired in mips photometry mode , allowing appropriate coverage of the sources and their extended emission .",
    "reduction of data from the spitzer archives follows the same procedure used in temi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . here",
    ", we briefly summarize the basic processes involved .",
    "we started with the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) products from the spitzer science pipeline ( version 16.1 ) to construct mosaic images for all objects .",
    "final calibrated images have been produced using the mosaicking and point - source extraction ( mopex ) package developed at the spitzer science center ( makovoz et al .",
    "mopex includes all the functions and steps necessary to process bcd data into corrected images and co - add them into a mosaic .",
    "the major mopex pipeline used was the mosaic pipeline which consists of a number of individual modules to be run in sequence to properly perform the reduction .",
    "we refer the reader to the mopex web page for a detailed description of each module . since the data sets presented here have been acquired in different observing modes , the modules chosen to buildup the reduction flow and their parameter setup",
    "have been carefully selected to properly remove mode - dependent artifacts in the final mosaic ( outlier detection and median filtering ) .",
    "data reduction presented here make use of the most updated mips flux calibration factors based on a large sample of stars and asteroids ( engelbracht et al . 2007 ; gordon et al .",
    "2007 ; stansberry et al 2007 ) .",
    "foreground stars and background galaxies present in the original mosaiced images were deleted before flux extraction was performed .",
    "these were identified by eye and cross - checked using surveys at other wavelengths ( digital sky survey and 2mass ) .",
    "flux densities were extracted from apertures that cover the entire optical disk ( r25 ) .",
    "sky subtraction was performed by averaging values from multiple apertures placed around the target , avoiding any overlap with the faint extended emission from the galaxy .",
    "statistical uncertainties related to sky subtraction are usually less than 1% but can be appreciable ( tens of percent ) for faint sources .",
    "observed infrared flux densities for each galaxy are listed in table 1 .",
    "columns 10 - 12 contain the specific flux @xmath16 ( mjy ) identified by each mips wavelength 24 , 70 , and 160@xmath1 m .",
    "systematics in the mips calibration result in fluxes uncertain at the 5% level at 24@xmath1 m and 10% at 70 and 15% at 160@xmath1 m .",
    "the uncertainties listed in table 1 include the systematic uncertainties .",
    "aperture corrections for extended sources were applied to the fluxes as described in the spitzer observer s manual .",
    "the corresponding mips luminosities are @xmath17 , where distances @xmath18 are from table 1 .",
    "figure 1 shows the luminosities in three spitzer bandpasses plotted against the @xmath0-band luminosity @xmath19 . the tight correlation among the elliptical galaxies ( filled red circles ) in the upper panel",
    "is expected from an old stellar population in which most of the warmer dust emitting at 24@xmath1 m is in circumstellar outflows from old red giant stars .",
    "the correlation visible in this panel is approximately @xmath20 ( tbm09 ) .",
    "( here and in the following @xmath21 and other mips luminosities are in erg s@xmath5 and @xmath19 are in solar units @xmath22 . )",
    "a circumstellar origin for @xmath21 in the old stellar populations in elliptical galaxies is based on the @xmath23 surface brightness profiles observed in both 24@xmath1 m and @xmath0-band emission ( temi , brighenti & mathews 2008 , hereafter tbm08 ) .",
    "whenever possible , the optical colors of early type galaxies in figure 1 are designated with red or blue colors if @xmath24 exceeds 1.1 or not .",
    "blue e and s0 galaxies are found only for @xmath25 , consistent with the much larger sample of kannappan et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "relatively weak emission at 70 and 160@xmath1 m from elliptical galaxies can be interpreted as emission from cold interstellar dust heated by diffuse starlight and thermal electrons in the hot interstellar gas ( tmb07 ) .",
    "somewhat stronger emission at 70 and 160@xmath1 m ( as well as 24@xmath1 m ) indicates either emission from dust that is buoyantly transported out from galactic cores by agn feedback or , for the most infrared - luminous ellipticals , emission from large masses of dusty , star - forming gas apparently acquired in mergers with gas - rich galaxies . while a few s0 galaxies ( open circles ) occupy the same regions as the elliptical galaxies in figure 1 , the infrared luminosities of many s0 galaxies exceed those of e galaxies in all three spitzer passbands .",
    "while most representations of the spitzer data result in broad scatter plots such as figure 1 , much tighter correlations emerge when the infrared luminosities are normalized by @xmath19 as in figure 2 .",
    "figure 2 significantly extends figure 5 in tbm09which does not continue above @xmath26 .",
    "in figure 2 and subsequent figures we plot only spitzer detections , not upper limits .",
    "the banana - shaped correlation in figure 2 is driven by variations in the luminosity @xmath19 of old stars and varying amounts of star - forming dusty gas .",
    "most of the e galaxies and a few s0 galaxies with @xmath27 and @xmath28 less than @xmath29 have 24-ks colors @xmath30 characteristic of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of an old stellar population including circumstellar emission at 24@xmath1 m ( tbm09 ) .",
    "we expect @xmath31 to asymptotically approach @xmath3230.1 as @xmath33 decreases in figure 2 .",
    "it is unclear why the approach toward this final sed value is more complete in the horizontal distribution of red galaxies in the upper panel of figure 2 than in the lower panel which may have a small residual positive slope when @xmath34 .",
    "provided the infrared colors @xmath35 and @xmath36 are reasonably constant , galaxies with smaller @xmath19 lie toward the upper right in both panels of figure 2 .",
    "figure 3 is a second version of the data in figure 2 that shows in detail how @xmath19 varies along the correlations .",
    "while @xmath19 decreases systematically toward the upper right in both panels of figure 3 , this trend is far from monotonic .",
    "in figure 2 we label the morphological type of early galaxies as either e or s0 while in practice morphological designations along the hubble sequence are not rigorously discrete . in the introduction",
    "we mentioned the uncertain morphological transition between e and s0 galaxies and the intermediate e - s0 type .",
    "as can be seen in column 3 of table 1 , the transition from s0 to later type sa galaxies is also gradual with s0-a ( s0a or s0/a ) galaxies bridging the transition . to explore the importance of these intermediate galaxy types",
    ", we examined plots similar to figure 2 with early type galaxies binned by their specific hyperleda morphology : e , e - s0 , s0 and s0-a . for the relatively small numbers of galaxies in each subtype , we were unable to detect any difference between the distributions of s0 and s0-a galaxies in figure 2 , both types appear to be spread evenly along the entire color - color plot . the small number ( @xmath37 ) of e - s0 galaxies in table 1 appear to be distributed as expected , sharing properties of both red and blue ( e and s0 ) points in figure 2 .",
    "consequently , in our plots we simply use the de vaucouleurs t = -3.0 to separate e from s0 and regard all hyperleda s0-a galaxies in table 1 as s0 galaxies .",
    "such distinctions are likely to be difficult or impossible for early type galaxies at high redshift .    to investigate further the origin of the tight correlations in figures 2 and 3 , we show in figures 4a and 4b the independent variations of @xmath19 and @xmath21 with @xmath38 , plotted along the horizontal axis exactly as in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "figure 4a clearly reveals that the correlations in figure 2 are largely a consequence of a pronounced decline in @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath19 can be considered a proxy for the mass of the old stellar population . but",
    "figure 4b shows that the correlation in figure 2 is also influenced by an increase in @xmath21 .",
    "it is most interesting that the considerable scatter in figures 4a and 4b is greatly reduced in figure 2 .",
    "evidently values of both @xmath21 and @xmath19 for each galaxy conspire to ensure the much smaller scatter in figure 2 .    when @xmath39 sufficiently exceeds the old stellar population sed value 30.1 in figure 2 , @xmath39 becomes a measure of the specific star formation rate per unit @xmath19 .",
    "in tbm09 we modified the expression for the star formation rate ( sfr ) based on 24@xmath1 m emission from calzetti et al .",
    "( 2007 ) so that it is forced to become zero for old elliptical galaxies where circumstellar dust produces the 24@xmath1 m emission , not star formation : @xmath40 @xmath41^{0.885}.\\ ] ] this equation only applies when @xmath39 exceeds the range of values observed in old e galaxies , i.e. @xmath42 or @xmath43 for those ( mostly s0 ) galaxies in figure 2 with @xmath44 , the specific sfr per unit @xmath19 increases with increasing @xmath39 .",
    "this is consistent with the bluer colors of s0 galaxies in the upper part of the correlation in figure 2 and with the `` downsizing '' notion that most current star formation is occurring in low-@xmath19 galaxies ( cowie et al .",
    "1996 ) . using equation ( 2 ) ,",
    "the star formation rates for the s0 galaxies having the largest @xmath21 ( top panel of figure 1 ) is remarkably large : @xmath45 @xmath4 yr@xmath5 for @xmath46 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "we now compare the results of our archival spitzer sample of e and s0 galaxies with similar spitzer observations of nearby normal galaxies spanning all morphological types . for this",
    "we use the sirtf nearby galaxy survey or sings sample ( kennicutt et al .",
    "2003 ) which has been extensively observed with spitzer and other telescopes . using data from kennicutt et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and the sings website , we plot in figure 5 the sings spitzer data in the same format as shown in the upper panels of figures 2 and 4 . in figure 5",
    "the sings galaxies are binned by morphological type designated by the hyperleda designation of the de vaucouleurs t parameter ( upper panel ) and by @xmath19 ( lower panel ) .",
    "figure 5 reveals that the morphological type of sings galaxies becomes progressively later ( larger @xmath47 ) and the stellar luminosity @xmath19 becomes smaller with increasing log@xmath48 , a measure of the star formation rate per @xmath19 .",
    "some of the morphological bins scatter along the correlation more than others and , as expected from figure 2 , this scatter is particularly large for sings s0 galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , at least for some morphological types , it is remarkable that an approximate value of the type @xmath47 can be inferred from @xmath19 plus a single infrared observation of either 24 , 70 or 160@xmath1 m .",
    "this single - color morphological identification is particularly effective for e ( @xmath49 ) and sb - sd ( @xmath50 ) galaxies where the variation of @xmath48 is more concentrated in figure 5 .",
    "dale et al . ( 2007 ) describe the detailed spectral energy distributions of the sings galaxies from uv to sub - millimeter wavelengths .",
    "we note that our figure 5 is a somewhat simplified version of their figure 10 where they plot a photometric measure of the specific star formation rate",
    " a combination of uv emission from young stars with reprocessed infrared emission normalized by @xmath19  against the ratio of ir to uv light , also identifying each galaxy by its morphological type .",
    "their figure lacks the banana simplicity of our figure 5 in part because old population stars in early type galaxies can emit uv ( and 24@xmath1 m ) emission that is unrelated to the specific star formation rate .    in figure 6",
    "we combine the color - color plot of our sample of early type galaxies ( as in figure 2 ) with the sings galaxies now represented simply with black @xmath51 symbols .",
    "it is seen that galaxies of all morphological types and stellar masses lie along the same well defined banana - shaped correlation .",
    "in particular the s0 galaxies in our sample obey exactly the same correlation in the infrared color - color plot as the entire morphological sequence of normal galaxies , from ellipticals to irregulars .",
    "the coincidence of s0 infrared colors in figure 6 with those of late - type sings galaxies , from spirals to irregulars , seems particularly surprising since cold gas in s0 galaxies is typically confined to small kpc - sized disks ( e.g. young , bendo & lucero 2009 ) .",
    "furthermore , s0 galaxies of varying @xmath19 have star formation rates similar to spiral or irregular galaxies that are nearby in the infrared color - color plot ( fig .",
    "however , the specific sfr that we refer to is based on observations of @xmath39 ( eqn .",
    "2 ) , not balmer emission line luminosities ( kennicutt et al . 2003 ) which , as least for the sauron galaxies ( tbm09 ) , may not be as reliable in estimating the sfrs in s0 galaxies as in normal late type galaxies ( kennicutt et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in the upper panel of figure 7",
    "we compare galaxies from our early - type and the sings samples in a different way by over - plotting both samples as in the upper panel of figure 1 but with @xmath21 normalized with @xmath19 . using the symbol notation of figure 1 ,",
    "the sample of early - type galaxies is shown as filled ( e and e - s0 ) or open ( s0 and later types ) circles which are red or blue depending on the @xmath24 color .",
    "early - type galaxies with unknown @xmath24 are shown with green symbols .",
    "the infrared color - magnitude diagram in the upper panel shows that galaxies are separated in an infrared red sequence ( the horizontal strip at the bottom , locus of most ellipticals ) and an infrared blue cloud , where almost all the sings galaxies and many s0s reside .",
    "the two sequences merge at the high luminosity end of our sample .",
    "about 24% of our early - type galaxies inhabit the infrared blue cloud .",
    "this result is consistent with the fraction of _ not passive _ early - type galaxies in the coma cluster estimated by clemens et al .",
    "( 2009 ) through the analysis of the ( @xmath52 $ ] ) color - magnitude diagram .    the sings galaxies ( black @xmath51 symbols in fig .",
    "7 ) , occupy most of the same region as the early - type sample but extend to lower values of @xmath19 , possibly reflecting a relative absence of low mass s0 galaxies .",
    "while this plot undoubtedly suffers from incompleteness and the multifarious nature of archived data , we see a gap or absence of galaxies with @xmath53 in the range @xmath54",
    ". however , the star formation rate would be very small for any galaxy that might exist in this gap .",
    "for example , at the upper boundary of this region devoid of galaxies @xmath55 and by equation ( 2 ) this corresponds to @xmath56 @xmath4 yr@xmath5 which is very small indeed .",
    "figure 8 shows an optical color - magnitude diagram for our sample ( and the sings sample ) based on photometry from the website maintained by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "e , s0 and s0-a galaxies are shown respectively with red , green and blue symbols ( no sample e / s0 galaxies have sdss colors ) .",
    "the zero - redshift `` red sequence '' region is shown in figure 8 as a solid line bracketed by an approximate @xmath57 dashed lines as found by schawinski et al .",
    "notice that s0 and s0-a galaxies appear to occupy approximately the same region in figure 8 extending from the red sequence to the blue cloud region below , schematically shown as a shaded area ( see baldry et al . , 2004 , 2006 ) .",
    "about 15% of early - type galaxies in our sample are in the blue cloud ( see also schawinski et al .",
    "2009 , kannappan , guie & baker 2009 ) .",
    "the lower panel of figure 7 shows the corresponding infrared color - magnitude plot for galaxies in our sample and the sings sample ( @xmath51 symbols ) having sdss colors plotted in figure 8 .",
    "the red ( blue ) symbols in the lower panel of figure 7 represent galaxies that lie above ( below ) the lower dashed line in figure 8 .",
    "symbols for e galaxies in this panel are filled and those for s0 or s0-a are open .",
    "what is striking about this panel is the relatively high specific star formation rates ( larger log@xmath58 ) for many galaxies that occupy the red - sequence region of figure 8 .",
    "conversely , several galaxies that lie below the red sequence region in figure 8 are seen to have red and dead infrared colors in the lower panel of figure 7 , i.e. with log@xmath58 typical of an old stellar population .    in figure 9",
    "we plot both samples in the @xmath59 color - color plot .",
    "most sings galaxies in this plot have @xmath60 , resembling the @xmath35 of early - type galaxies having low @xmath35 .",
    "this plot suggests that the relative lack of scatter along the sings - sample correlation in figure 5 is due in part to the general similarity of the @xmath35 and @xmath61 colors in dust emission temperatures among all galaxies .",
    "how closely do the galactic sfr and fir luminosities depend on the mass of cold hi or h@xmath62 gas ? to answer this question we begin by plotting in figure 10 the observed mass of hi and h@xmath62 per unit @xmath19 as a function of @xmath27 , duplicating ( the upper panel of ) figure 2 and figure 5 but replacing @xmath21 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 . while correlations are clearly visible in figure 10  approximately with @xmath65  the scatter with @xmath66 ( fig .",
    "10 upper panel ) is significantly larger than those in figures 2 and 5 .",
    "the much lower scatter in the bottom panel of figure 5 supports the widely accepted notion that stars form from molecular not atomic gas .",
    "nevertheless , galaxies with similar @xmath21 can have masses of molecular gas that vary over an order of magnitude . at fixed values of @xmath67",
    "the vertical scatter in figure 2 is slightly less than that in the lower panel of figure 10 , suggesting that @xmath48 is a better indicator of the specific sfr than @xmath68 .",
    "notice also that the sings galaxies occupy most of the same region in figure 10 as the e and s0 galaxies in our sample , except near the upper and lower limits of the correlation .    in figure 11",
    "we explore this further by plotting @xmath21 against the total mass of known cold gas @xmath69 .",
    "it is seen that @xmath21 can remain unchanged when @xmath70 varies by more than an order of magnitude and conversely , @xmath21 can vary by 10 - 100 among galaxies with the same @xmath70 .",
    "the relationship between cold gas content and the sfr has a large scatter .",
    "star - formation , as indicated by the 24@xmath1 m emission , may be more sensitive to the local column density of molecular gas rather than its mean column density or total mass .    in principle",
    "the mass of cold gas and the star formation rate sfr@xmath71 can be used to estimate the time required to entirely consume the cold gas .",
    "an estimate of the gas consumption time is best done if we consider a subsample of s0 galaxies having similar morphologies and stellar mass .",
    "consider , for example , an s0 galaxy with @xmath72 @xmath22 and initial @xmath73 with @xmath74 near the top of figure 1 and suppose this galaxy initially contains cold gas of mass @xmath75 .",
    "assume also that the galaxy forms stars at a rate sfr(@xmath21 ) given by equation ( 2 ) based on calzetti et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . setting aside the complication of mass return back to the interstellar medium from both young and old stars ,",
    "the time required for all the gas to be consumed into stars is @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the maximum circumstellar emission expected from a gas - free s0 galaxy with @xmath72 @xmath22 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . to estimate ( @xmath78 ) in equation ( 3 ) we plot in figure 12 the observed @xmath79 relation for galaxies having @xmath80 @xmath81 . unfortunately",
    ", it is clear from figure 12 that the variation of @xmath78 with @xmath21 is too uncertain to estimate the time required for the s0 galaxy to become `` red and dead '' .",
    "evidently either ( i ) uncertainties in @xmath70 observations create too much scatter in figure 12 , ( ii ) rotationally supported cold gas in s0 galaxies having similar @xmath70 can be radially distributed in many different ( post - merger ? ) ways , causing strong variations in local column density , the sfr and therefore @xmath21 , or ( iii ) star formation may occur in a very intermittent fashion , causing @xmath21 to have large variations for a given @xmath70 .",
    "moreover , for some well - studied s0 galaxies with low sfrs the rate of stellar mass loss could in principle replenish cold gas at approximately the same rate that it is consumed by star formation ( tbm09 ) .",
    "nevertheless , since the uncertain slopes @xmath78 in figures 10 and 11 appear to be quite large , it is possible that the star - formation rates in the cold gas are generally low and the gas - depletion times in s0 galaxies are long .",
    "the dusty star - forming regions in s0 galaxies are typically located in rotationally supported kpc - sized disks ( e.g. combes , young & bureau 2007 ; young , bureau & cappellari 2008 and young , bendo & lucero 2009 ) .",
    "there is general agreement that at least some cold gas disks with masses @xmath82 @xmath4 in s0 galaxies arise as a result of mergers , as confirmed in a few cases by counter - rotation ( e.g. bertola et al .",
    "1992 ; kannappan & fabricant 2001 ; kannappan , guie & baker 2009 : silchenko , moiseev & afanasiev 2009 ) .",
    "the statistical frequency of counter - rotating gas in early - type galaxies suggests that about half of them have acquired cold gas in a merger or related event ( kannappan & fabricant 2001 ) . to our knowledge",
    "no stars are observed to be counter - rotating with the cold gaseous s0 disks , but such observations might be possible by measuring the velocity of the absorption responsible for the h@xmath6 index .",
    "evidently either the mergers are very recent or ( more likely ? ) the mergers are quite old but the star formation rates are quite low . although our data are sparse , the range of optical colors among the s0 galaxies in our sample is substantial , @xmath83 .",

    "however , many s0 galaxies appear to contain substantial masses of cold gas and dust which is heated by star formation and radiates at all spitzer mips wavelengths . using estimates of the star formation rate from the 24@xmath1 m luminosity ( calzetti et al .",

    "2 ) , the most infrared - luminous s0 galaxies are currently forming stars at 1 - 10 @xmath4 yr@xmath5 .",
    "many s0s have blue @xmath24 colors consistent with recent star formation",
    ".    .1 in ( 2 ) for our large sample of early - type e and s0 galaxies we find that infrared color - color diagrams with @xmath84 plotted against @xmath85 or @xmath86 result in unusually tight correlations . at low values of @xmath85 or @xmath86 these plots",
    "saturate at @xmath87 , corresponding to the typical sed for gas - free galaxies where there is no evidence for star formation and all the 24@xmath1 m emission is circumstellar dust emission from old population giants .",
    "as the mass of cold dusty gas increases in s0 galaxies relative to that in the stars , @xmath85 and @xmath86 increase and the color - color correlations are elongated in the direction of decreasing @xmath19 .",

    "the specific star formation rates per unit @xmath89 ( or stellar mass ) for some s0 galaxies is comparable to those of spiral or irregular galaxies that lie near them in the infrared color - color plot ( fig .",
    "2 ) . the significant gas content in many s0 galaxies is likely to be relevant toward understanding the nature and origin of these galaxies .",
    ".1 in ( 4 ) far - infrared luminosities correlate only weakly with the mass of neutral and molecular hydrogen for sings galaxies and s0 galaxies from our sample .",
    "this suggests that star formation may be intermittent or that disks with nearly equal masses of cold gas are distributed differently with galactic radius in similar s0 galaxies so that the variation of local cold gas ( volume and column ) densities alters the local and global star formation rates .",
    ".1 in ( 5 ) early type galaxies do not have infrared properties that strictly adhere to the red sequence and blue cloud regions of the sdss color magnitude plot .",
    "for example , in an ir color - magnitude plot quite a few galaxies in the sdss red sequence occupy an infrared blue cloud region with larger log@xmath58 than passively evolving ellipticals , indicating relatively high specific star formation rates .",
    "conversely , a few galaxies occupying the green valley or blue cloud region of the sdss color magnitude plot have infrared star formation rates that are indistinguishable from pure gas - free , passively - evolving old stellar populations that define the infrared red sequence .",

    "<S> we describe the infrared properties of a large sample of early type galaxies , comparing data from the spitzer archive with @xmath0-band emission from 2mass . while most representations of this data result in correlations with large scatter , we find a remarkably tight relation among colors formed by ratios of luminosities in spitzer - mips bands ( 24 , 70 and 160@xmath1 m ) and the @xmath0-band . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , this correlation among e and s0 galaxies follows that of nearby normal galaxies of all morphological types . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the tight infrared color - color correlation for s0 galaxies alone follows that of the entire hubble sequence of normal galaxies , roughly in order of galaxy type from ellipticals to spirals to irregulars . the specific star formation rate of s0 galaxies estimated from the 24@xmath1 m luminosity increases with decreasing @xmath2-band luminosity ( or stellar mass ) from essentially zero , as with most massive ellipticals , to rates typical of irregular galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the luminosities of the many infrared - luminous s0 galaxies can significantly exceed those of the most luminous ( presumably post - merger ) e galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> star formation rates in the most infrared - luminous s0 galaxies approach 110 solar masses per year . consistently with this picture we find that while most early - type galaxies populate an infrared red sequence , about 24% of the objects ( mostly s0s ) are in an infrared blue cloud together with late type galaxies . for </S>",
    "<S> those early - type galaxies also observed at radio frequencies we find that the far - infrared luminosities correlate with the mass of neutral and molecular hydrogen , but the scatter is large . </S>",
    "<S> this scatter suggests that the star formation may be intermittent or that similar s0 galaxies with cold gaseous disks of nearly equal mass can have varying radial column density distributions that alter the local and global star formation rates .    </S>",
