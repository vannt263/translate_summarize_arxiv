    "recent discoveries of extra - solar giant planets stars have raised questions about their formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , their characteristics have been a surprise : they orbit much closer to the stars than the planets in our own solar system and their masses range from that of saturn up to 10 times the mass of jupiter ( @xmath20 m@xmath21 ) .",
    "these planets are expected to contain a solid core surrounded by a shell of metallic hydrogen and helium and an outer low pressure atmosphere where hydrogen is in the form of h@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "to build such gaseous giant planets , a large reservoir of h@xmath16 gas is needed at the time of their formation , most likely in the form of a circumstellar disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most studies of circumstellar material associated with young stars and debris - disk objects rely on continuum observations of the infrared to millimeter emission produced by heated dust ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "dust particles represent only a trace component of disks , however , which have 99% of their mass initially in the form of h@xmath16 gas .",
    "line imaging of trace molecules such as co with millimeter interferometers reveals the presence of gas in circumstellar disks with sizes of @xmath22100 - 400  au , but the inferred masses are up to two orders of magnitude lower than those deduced from the dust continuum assuming a standard gas / dust ratio and co / h@xmath16 conversion factor as in molecular clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the millimeter observations have nevertheless provided compelling evidence for gas in keplerian rotation around the central star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we report here the result of the first spectral survey of the pure - rotational h@xmath23 emission lines from circumstellar disks , the only molecule hich can directly constrain the reservoir of warm molecular gas .",
    "a related question is the temperature structure of the circumstellar disks .",
    "the radial temperature structure is usually constrained by modeling of the spectral energy distribution assuming either a thin , flat disk geometry ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or a flaring disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dust in these models is heated by radiation from the central star and by the release of energy through accretion .",
    "recent calculations by different groups show substantial differences , however ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . specifically , flared disks may have surface layers with temperatures in excess of 100  k out to @xmath24100  au @xcite .",
    "the fitting of spectral energy distributions is known to give ambiguous answers and many disk parameters are still debated because of the non - uniqueness of the fits ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "h@xmath13 emission line data can provide direct measurements of the temperature of the warm gas .    according to standard models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , giant planet formation by core accretion of gas occurs in the first few millions years .",
    "thus , the timescale for the disappearance of the gas compared with that of the dust is of interest .",
    "based on continuum data , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite suggested that dust disks around t  tauri stars disappear at an age of a few million years .",
    "@xcite searched for evolutionary trends in the outer disk dust mass around herbig  ae stars .",
    "they found no evidence for changes between 10@xmath25 and 10@xmath18 years , but an abrupt transition seems to occur at 10@xmath18 years from massive dust disks to tenuous debris disks .",
    "@xcite conducted a survey of co emission from a - type stars with ages between 10@xmath1710@xmath18 years and concluded that the gaseous disks disappear within 10@xmath18 years .",
    "determination of the gaseous mass from co data is hampered , however , by several difficulties compared to that from h@xmath26 .",
    "provided that h@xmath16 traces the bulk of molecular gas , it can constrain the time scale for gas dissipation from the disk directly .",
    "observations of the pure - rotational lines such as the h@xmath16 @xmath9=20 s(0 ) 28.218 @xmath27 m and @xmath9=31 s(1 ) 17.035 @xmath27 m lines are difficult from the ground because of the low terrestrial atmospheric transmission in the mid - infrared . the short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) on board the _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) has allowed the first opportunity to observe a sample of t  tauri and herbig  ae stars , as well as a few young debris - disk objects . the small mass of h@xmath16 implies that the two lowest rotational lines have upper states which lie at rather high energies , 510  k and 1015  k above ground , respectively .",
    "the @xmath9=20 and @xmath9=31 transitions are thus excellent tracers of the ` warm ' ( @xmath8 80200  k ) component of disks .",
    "the mid - infrared h@xmath28 data provide complementary information to ultraviolet h@xmath28 emission @xcite or absorption @xcite data toward circumstellar disks , which either probe only a small fraction of the h@xmath28 or depend on the line of sight through the disk and foreground material .",
    "h@xmath28 has also been detected at near infrared wavelengths @xcite , but since these lines are excited by ultraviolet radiation , x - rays or shocks , they also can not be used as a tracer of mass .",
    "spectroscopic observations of h@xmath16 have several advantages over other indirect methods .",
    "first , since it is the most abundant gaseous species , no conversion factor is needed .",
    "also , contrary to co , which has a condensation temperature of @xmath2920  k @xcite , it does not freeze effectively onto grain surfaces unless the temperatures fall below @xmath292  k @xcite  lower than the minimum temperature that a disk reaches .",
    "its photophysics and high abundance allow h@xmath16 to self - shield efficiently against photodissociation by far - ultraviolet photons , such as those produced by a - type stars @xcite .",
    "moreover , because the molecule is homonuclear , its rotational transitions are electric quadrupole in nature , and thus possess small einstein a - coefficients . on the one hand",
    ", this presents an observational problem since high spectral resolution is required to see the weak line on top of the usually strong mid - infrared continuum . on the other hand ,",
    "the benefit is that the lines remain optically thin to very high column densities , making the radiative transfer simple .",
    "another disadvantage is that the lines are only sensitive to warm gas and can not probe the bulk of the ( usually ) cold circumstellar material probed by co @xmath30 and @xmath31 interferometric observations .",
    "also , the high continuum optical depths at 28 @xmath32 m prevent observations into the inner warm mid - plane of the disk . as a complement",
    ", the same stellar sample has therefore been observed in the @xmath6co and @xmath7co @xmath33 lines with the _ james clerk maxwell telescope _ and the @xmath6co @xmath34 line with the _ caltech submillimeter observatory_. these transitions probe lower temperatures than h@xmath0 , about 2080  k in the regime where the dust is optically thin .",
    "the combination of h@xmath16 and co observations is sensitive to the full temperature range encountered in disks . along with millimeter continuum observations taken from the literature",
    ", such data can provide a global picture of the structure and evolution of both the gas and dust components of circumstellar disks .",
    "the paper is organized as followed .",
    "we first justify the choice of the objects in our sample (  2 ) . in  3 , a description of the observations is provided with emphasis on the special data reduction method used for the h@xmath16 lines . in  4 and 5 ,",
    "the data are presented and physical parameters such as mass and temperature are derived from our observations of h@xmath16 and co lines , as well as from 1.3 millimeter continuum fluxes taken from the literature . the accuracy of each method is assessed . in  6 , the different results are compared and possible trends with effective temperature of the star or age are investigated and the possible origin of the warm gas is mentioned briefly .",
    "finally , a discussion of the gas content in debris - disk objects is given .",
    "the results for one object , the double binary gg  tau , have been presented by @xcite .",
    "earlier accounts of this work may be found in @xcite and @xcite , whereas the debris - disk sources are discussed in @xcite .",
    "@xcite present searches for h@xmath16 emission in a complementary set of weak - line t  tauri objects .",
    "our study focuses on two classes of pre - main - sequence stars with transitional ages spanning 10@xmath1710@xmath18 years .",
    "t  tauri stars in the sample have spectral types of me and ke , corresponding to stellar masses in the range from 0.25 to 2 m@xmath21 and are probably younger analogs to the sun .",
    "the higher - mass herbig ae stars ( 23 m@xmath21 ) share the spectral type of debris - disk sources and may be considered as younger counterparts to the debris - disk objects . in addition , three young debris - disk objects , namely 49  ceti , hd  135344 and @xmath35  pictoris are included in our sample .",
    "the choice of objects is based on several criteria in order to maximize the chance to detect the faint h@xmath16 lines on top of the mid - infrared continuum and to avoid confusion with emission from remnant molecular cloud material .",
    "first , the observed stars exhibit the strongest 1.3 millimeter fluxes in the survey of t  tauri stars by @xcite and herbig ae stars by @xcite , i.e. , they possess the highest dust disk masses among the t  tauri and herbig ae stars in the taurus - auriga cloud .",
    "second , they have all been imaged with millimeter interferometers in co and dust continuum and show evidence for keplerian disks .",
    "the only exceptions are ux ori and ww vul , where no co is detected .",
    "third , the sample is biased toward sources with a weak mid - infrared continuum at 1030 @xmath32 m to improve the line - to - continuum contrast .",
    "this also prevents instrumental fringing problems .",
    "a faint mid - infrared excess suggests that a ` dust hole ' exists in the disk close to the star , which may be caused by settling and coagulation of dust particles in the mid - plane @xcite , to clearing of the inner part of the disk by small stellar companion(s ) or proto - planet(s ) ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or to shadowing of part of the disk @xcite .",
    "finally , most of these stars are located in parts of the taurus cloud where the co emission is very faint or absent .",
    "our original sample also included objects in ophiuchus @xcite , but these have been discarded from this sample because of confusion by cloud material .",
    "hd  135344 , 49  ceti and @xmath19  pictoris have been identified as debris - disk objects based on their far - infrared excess above the expected photospheric flux level ( e.g. backman & paresce 1993 ) .",
    "keck 20 @xmath27 m images reveal the presence of dust disks around the first two sources ( koerner 2000 , silverstone et al .",
    ", private communication ) whereas @xmath19  pictoris has been imaged at many wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hd  135344 , however , shows strong single - peaked h@xmath36 emission @xcite , suggesting that it also has herbig ae - type characteristics .",
    "the three debris - disk sources are objects located far from any molecular cloud .",
    "this work does not constitute a statistical study since the sample is limited in number and biased toward the highest disk masses and low mid - infrared continuum . in table  [ sources ] the stellar properties of objects of our sample are tabulated , including coordinates , effective temperature , luminosity , and distance , together with references to relevant literature .",
    "the h@xmath16 @xmath37 s(0 ) line at 28.218 @xmath27 m and the @xmath38 s(1 ) line at 17.035 @xmath27 m were observed with the iso - sws grating mode aot02 @xcite .",
    "typical integration times were 6001000  s per line , in which the 12 detectors were scanned several times over the 28.0528.40 and 16.9617.11 @xmath27 m ranges around the lines .",
    "the h@xmath16 @xmath39 s(3 ) 9.66 @xmath27 m and @xmath40 s(5 ) 6.91 @xmath27 m lines were measured in parallel with the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines , respectively , at virtually no extra time .",
    "the spectral resolving power @xmath41 for point sources is @xmath222000 at 28 @xmath27 m and @xmath222400 at 17 @xmath27 m .",
    "the sws aperture is @xmath42 at s(0 ) , @xmath43 at s(1 ) , and @xmath44 at s(3 ) and s(5 ) .",
    "for a few sources , observations of the s(1 ) line at a @xmath45 off position have been obtained as well .",
    "the s(2 ) j=42 12 @xmath27 m line was also searched for toward 49  ceti and hd  135344 .",
    "the continuum provides narrow band photometry . since the observing procedure does not perform spatial chopping , no zodiacal or background emission",
    "is subtracted .",
    "the zodiacal background component has a continuous spectrum corresponding to a dust temperature of about 260  k @xcite with an estimated flux density in the sws aperture of about 0.3  jy , so that it can contaminate the continuum emission in some of our faintest objects .",
    "continuum fluxes above 3 jy are considered as coming essentially from the sources ( star+disk ) alone .",
    "the expected peak flux levels of the h@xmath16 lines are close to the sensitivity limit of the instrument . in order to extract the h@xmath16 lines , special software designed to handle weak signals on a weak continuum was used for the data reduction in combination with the standard interactive analysis package . the details and justification of the methods used in the software are described elsewhere @xcite and summarized below ( see also the iso - sws manual at http://www.iso.vilspa.esa.es$/$users$/$expl_lib$/$sws_top.html ) .",
    "the raw data consist of 12 non - destructive measurements per elementary integration ( reset ) corresponding to the 12 single - pixel detectors , hence 24 observed points for a 2 second reset .",
    "a single scan lasts 200 seconds and typically 35 scans per line have been obtained , corresponding to 720012000 data points .",
    "since the readout system acts as a capacitor , the signal has the form of an exponential decay , and this curvature is first corrected using the ac time constant obtained during the pre - flight calibration phase",
    ". then a correction of the instantaneous response function , or ` pulse - shape ' , is applied with the level of the correction determined from the data themselves because the shape varies in time , a procedure called ` self - calibration ' .",
    "finally , a cross - talk correction is performed .",
    "this chain of calibration results in removing the curvature and improving the straightness of the observed slope which is in fact the measure of the flux .",
    "it also increases appreciably the photometric accuracy and allows a better subsequent determination of the noise .",
    "other factors , such as dark current drifts , influence the sensitivity limit of the instrument as well and have to be corrected .",
    "the majority of noisy data points are actually caused by impacts of cosmic rays , called glitches , either on the detectors or on the readout electronics .",
    "the level of cosmic ray hits fluctuates markedly , depending on the position of the satellite and the activity of the sun .",
    "the rate of glitches may vary from scan to scan . at the level we are interested in , up to",
    "50% of the data points can be rendered unusable by cosmic rays or other instrumental artifacts .",
    "cosmic rays not only affect the sensitivity of the detectors instantaneously , but also for some longer recovery time , a phenomenon called the post - glitch effect .",
    "most of the time , the glitches are secondary electron - hole pairs created by the interaction of the energetic particles with the detector elements ; while the lifetime of these pairs is short , other consequences of the impact can last longer .",
    "the decay of this effect is observed to have an exponential form . the observing procedure used by the sws allows investigators to track events emerging simultaneously in more than one detector .",
    "these so - called ` correlated - noise events ' appear as a spurious feature in emission or sometimes in absorption with a gaussian profile whose width is close to the resolution of the instrument .",
    "the gaussian - like profile comes from the fact that the glitch affects several detectors simultaneously , which results in a shift in wavelength in the final spectrum .    in order to detect and circumvent the glitches , four types of statistical filters",
    "have been defined .",
    "the first two are standard filters also employed in the sws pipeline software ; the last two are additions by us . the software is written in _ idl _",
    "( interactive data language ) .",
    "each of these filters generates an array of non - valid points detected by the adopted statistical method characterized by a unique parameter .",
    "thus , careful choices of filter parameters are crucial in determining the quality of the resulting spectrum .",
    "the arrays are then cross - correlated .",
    "most of the time , the glitches are detected by more than one filter and those points are immediately discarded .",
    "the first filter consists in removing points which have a flux outside a specified range defined by the user .",
    "this procedure may seem artificial , but is justified by the fact that both line and continuum fluxes are faint . in our data , this method removes points 5 sigma above the continuum standard deviation calculated using all points . the second filter searches for data points with a standard deviation of the slope - fitting higher than the standard value adopted in the sws pipeline .",
    "this filter is efficient when used after the self - calibration procedure described above .",
    "the third filter has been set up specifically in this work to detect correlated noise .",
    "this filter detects the glitches which are discrete stochastic events in the time domain .",
    "the data from the 12 detectors observed at a single time are summed , and the mean and standard deviations are computed .",
    "if the standard deviation is higher than a specified parameter @xmath46 , the data points are considered as glitches and are discarded in all 12 detectors .",
    "the value of @xmath46 , which is a multiple of the standard deviation @xmath47 , @xmath48 , is difficult to determine _ a priori _ and can vary from scan to scan .",
    "indeed , the computed @xmath47 is affected by the number of cosmic ray hits  a high rate of glitches results in a high standard deviation so that @xmath46 has to be small .",
    "we have therefore used an automated procedure to find the optimum values of @xmath49 , in which each spectrum is examined with a range of values of @xmath49 from @xmath50=16 times the standard deviation for each individual scan @xmath51 with a step of 0.5 .",
    "thus , for a typical case of 3 scans , 10@xmath52 versions of the reduced spectrum are generated .",
    "the fourth step removes additional points one or two resets after a glitch is detected by the previous technique .    the data reduction procedure results in a `` dot cloud '' of observed fluxes as functions of wavelength .",
    "as a final step , convolution with a gaussian whose fwhm is set by the theoretical resolution of iso - sws at the relevant wavelength is done .",
    "we have chosen to use a flux - conserving interpolation which can modify the resolution but does not change the total integrated flux .",
    "since the lines are not spectrally resolved , the line profile is not relevant .",
    "small velocity shifts of the line of order @xmath53 km s@xmath54 compared with the rest wavelengths are frequent .",
    "many parameters can cause such a shift , including the low signal - to - noise of the data or pointing offsets .",
    "the latter problem not only affects the peak position but also the flux since the beam profile is highly dependent on the position in the entrance slit of the spectrometer . because the h@xmath16 emission can arise from a region 12@xmath55 offset compared to the position of the star , additional shifts of the order of a few tens of km s@xmath56 are possible",
    "the 1000 spectra are then sorted by number of remaining data points .",
    "generally , the noise level due to glitches tends to decrease significantly as the number of points decreases until a minimum is reached when the statistical noise takes over because of the small number of data points left . with this non - standard data reduction procedure ,",
    "it is difficult to devise an objective detection criterion .",
    "therefore , we adopt the following definition of the level of confidence in our detections , depending on the final @xmath57 of the spectrum as well as the fraction of reduced spectra in which the line is clearly seen .",
    "a line is considered to be detected when the @xmath57 is 3 or higher and if its profile lies within a gaussian mimicking the line profile of an extended source filling the entire beam .",
    "observations which are only slightly affected by cosmic ray hits show detections in a large number of the reduced spectra ( @xmath58 75% of the 1000 spectra ) .",
    "the level of confidence of the detection is considered  high \" in those cases .",
    "the level becomes  medium \" when the detection is present in about 5075% of the spectra . in cases of non - detection",
    ", the line is seen in less than 50% of the reductions .",
    "ultimately , we can not rule out possible instrumental artifacts which are not detected by our filters .",
    "of all the possible reductions , the spectrum with the lowest continuum fluctuation ( fringing ) and noise and the highest @xmath57 of the line is kept as our best reduced spectrum and plotted in this paper .",
    "the criterion of high peak flux and @xmath57 comes from the fact that the filters described above eliminate not only noisy data points but also some valid points to a certain level . to keep this level as low as possible , a compromise between quality ( i.e. , @xmath57 ) and flux level is adopted .",
    "the non - gaussian nature of the noise makes the overall error difficult to estimate , and we assume a fiducial 30% photometric uncertainty in the rest of the paper .",
    "this error is propagated into all the resulting temperatures and masses .",
    "the actual uncertainty may be larger due to the low @xmath59 of the data , but can not be quantified in a consistent way for different sources .",
    "note that the above procedure only throws away data points and therefore can not create artificial lines .",
    "this is confirmed by the absence of lines at blank sky , or off - source , positions reduced with the same procedure .",
    "the above method was adopted for all sources with a weak continuum level ( @xmath603 jy ) . for sources with a strong mid - infrared continuum (",
    "ab aur , hd 163296 , ry tau , cq tau , mwc 863 ) , the fringing effect on the continuum becomes the limiting factor for detection .",
    "errors in the dark current subtraction are a possible cause of this fringing . for these sources ,",
    "the fringes have been minimized by varying the dark current level .      as a complement to the iso - sws data",
    ", we have observed the same sample of t  tauri and herbig ae stars in various moderate- to high-@xmath9 co transitions between 1998 and 2000 with submillimeter single - dish telescopes .",
    "previous studies have observed the lowest @xmath9=10 and/or @xmath61 transitions , either with interferometers @xcite or with single dishes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but no homogeneous data set using the same line , isotope and telescope exists for our sources .",
    "we focus here on the higher-@xmath9 32 and 65 transitions to probe gas with @xmath62=2080  k.    observations of the @xmath6co and @xmath7co @xmath33 lines were carried out at the _ james clerk maxwell telescope _ ( jcmt ) using the dual polarization receiver b3 as the frontend and the digital autocorrelator spectrometer ( das ) as the backend .",
    "data were acquired with a beam switch of 180@xmath55 and , in cases of extended emission , also a position switch up to @xmath63 . to check for extended emission ,",
    "several positions offset by @xmath64 were observed as well .",
    "since the fwhm beam size of the jcmt at 345 ghz is 14@xmath55 and the extent of the disks at the distance of taurus is at most 5@xmath55 , the observations suffer from large beam dilution , as do the h@xmath16 data .",
    "the receiver was tuned single sideband , with typical system temperatures above the atmosphere ranging from 400600  k. the spectral resolution was typically 0.13 km s@xmath56 , sufficient to resolve the line profiles , but the data are hanning - smoothed once to improve the signal - to - noise . the final spectral resolution is 0.26 km s@xmath65 .",
    "integration times were typically 1020 minutes for @xmath6co and up to 2 hrs for @xmath66co reaching a typical rms noise of @xmath29 15 mk .",
    "the antenna temperatures have been converted to main beam temperatures using a main beam efficiency at 330 ghz of @xmath67=0.62 obtained from observations of planets by the jcmt staff ( see http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/jacpublic/jcmt/rx/b3/cal.html ) .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the specx and class software .",

    "the h@xmath16 line positions and basic molecular data are listed in table  [ h2data ] , whereas the h@xmath16 s(0 ) and s(1 ) integrated fluxes are reported in table  [ h2iso ] .",
    "the s(3 ) and s(5 ) lines are not detected in any of the objects with an upper limit of @xmath704@xmath7110@xmath72 erg s@xmath56 @xmath73 ( 3@xmath74 ) .",
    "the level of confidence of a detection is indicated in the right - hand column of table  [ h2iso ] .",
    "similarly , the s(2 ) line is not detected toward 49  ceti or hd  135344 with an upper limit of @xmath299@xmath7510@xmath72 erg s@xmath54 @xmath73 .",
    "both the s(2 ) and s(3 ) lines are located in a wavelength region where silicate features in emission or absorption are strong .",
    "lines are detected in several disks around t  tauri and herbig ae stars , with no apparent trend with age or spectral type ( see  6.2 ) .",
    "there are also likely detections of lines toward the debris - disk objects , especially from hd  135344 and @xmath76 pictoris .",
    "the s(1 ) line shows a wider spread in observed fluxes and is more readily detected for several reasons .",
    "first , the einstein-@xmath77 coefficient for the @xmath9=@xmath78 line is a factor of 16.5 larger than that of the @xmath79 line .",
    "also , the spectral resolution is somewhat higher at 17 @xmath32 m than at 28 @xmath32 m and the continuum lower , so that the line - to - continuum ratio is larger . finally , the sensitivity of the 17 @xmath32 m detectors is better .",
    "all of these factors explain why the s(1 ) line is more easily seen than the s(0 ) line , in spite of the fact that the @xmath9=3 level has a factor of 40 lower population than the @xmath9=2 level in gas with an estimated temperature of around 100  k.      except for the case of @xmath35  pictoris , the iso - sws beam is much larger than the typical sizes of the circumstellar disks of @xmath605@xmath81 .",
    "thus , care has to be taken that the h@xmath16 emission is not affected by any remnant cloud or envelope material in the beam .",
    "observations of the s(1 ) line have been obtained at several off source positions @xmath45 south . toward 49  ceti and hd  135344 , which are far away from any molecular cloud ,",
    "no emission is detected off source at the level of 8@xmath8210@xmath72 erg s@xmath56 @xmath73 rms , consistent with the expectation that diffuse atomic gas does not emit in h@xmath16 lines .",
    "a weak s(1 ) line of @xmath29 10@xmath83 erg s@xmath56 @xmath73 is seen @xmath45 south of lkca  15 .",

    "recently , @xcite argue that @xmath76  pictoris is only ( 20@xmath12910 ) @xmath152 years old with the error bar reflecting the uncertainties in the isochrones used to derive the age . the young age of @xmath76  pictoris is consistent with the view that it is part of a cluster of recent nearby star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . whatever its actual age , @xmath76  pictoris is the oldest member in our sample .",
    "figure  [ mass_age ] shows the total disk masses deduced from the three methods plotted against the ages of the stars .",
    "no strong evolutionary trend appears but the behavior seems to be similar for the three methods .",
    "figure  [ gas_to_dust ] presents the total warm + cold gas masses derived from the h@xmath13 + co data relative to the total dust mass derived from the 1.3 millimeter continuum versus age . as discussed in  6.4 ,",
    "only the debris - disk objects show a gas / dust ratio close to 100:1 , but this may be coincidental ; for the younger objects , a significant amount of cold h@xmath13 is likely present , but is not traced by co.    care has to be taken in the interpretation of these data , however . as mentioned before , the choice of objects in our sample is biased toward the higher disk masses and some of the detections are marginal .",
    "in fact , so - called weak - line t  tauri stars are surrounded by disks with lower masses @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the non - detection of h@xmath13 in these objects by @xcite .",
    "our data are not sensitive to masses as small as @xmath153 m@xmath154 for objects at a distance of 140 pc .",
    "similarly , @xmath76  pictoris may be unusual since it is one of the dustiest members of the debris - disk family . finally , it is difficult to compare different absolute masses since the mass of the disk at a given time of its evolution likely depends on the initial mass available .",
    "the derived amount of warm gas is significant and raises the question of the source of heating .",
    "@xcite discussed several possibilities , including photon heating by stellar and interstellar radiation and shock - heating caused by the interaction between a stellar wind and the surface of disks . here",
    "we investigate whether the observed trends provide further clues to the dominant mechanisms .",
    "quantitative discussions and detailed modeling are left for future work .",
    "since the disks in our sample have negligible accretion onto the star ( typically @xmath155 10@xmath156 m@xmath157 yr@xmath65 ) , the irradiation of the central object should control , at least partially , the temperature profile of the disks .",
    "to study this scenario , we plot in figure  [ corr4 ] the excitation temperatures derived from the h@xmath13 s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines as functions of the effective temperature of the star .",
    "obviously , no significant correlation is found in this figure .",
    "we can , however , distinguish three groups : t  tauri , herbig  ae and debris - disk stars . the t  tauri stars have gas at @xmath24100  k , whereas their higher mass counterparts are surrounded by gas at 150  k or more .",
    "the higher @xmath158 observed in disks around herbig ae stars suggests that the harder stellar ultraviolet radiation can be transformed more efficiently into heat for these objects .",
    "however , if the number of photons with wavelengths @xmath1551100   capable of ionizing atomic carbon is also increased , this results in a larger c@xmath159 abundance , increasing the cooling as well .",
    "detailed modeling of the surface heating as a function of radiation field is needed .",
    "note that classical models of photon - dominated - regions ( pdrs ) do not show any increase of the h@xmath13 excitation temperature versus strength of the incident radiation field for the normal interstellar field typical of a b0 star , even though the surface temperatures increase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the variation of @xmath158 with effective temperature of the star has not yet been modeled .",
    "a link seems to exist between the excitation temperature and the continuum flux at 28 @xmath122 m normalized at 100  au ( figure  [ corr4]@xmath160 ) . above a certain threshold , the excitation temperature increases as the continuum flux becomes higher . as a consequence ,",
    "the warm gas mass drops with continuum flux or @xmath161 because of the steep dependence of the mass on temperature ( eq .",
    "( 3 ) and figure  [ masstemp ] ) ( see figure  [ corr4]@xmath162 and [ corr4]@xmath163 ) . moreover , the fraction of warm gas to the total gas mass around typical a stars like hd  163296 or ab  aur is small compared to that around t  tauri stars .",
    "the role of ultraviolet radiation in heating the surfaces of flared disks is taken into account in recent models by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . as shown by @xcite , these models fall short of explaining the observed masses of warm h@xmath16 gas by factors of at least a few .",
    "it is not yet clear whether this discrepancy is significant , since the same models also fail for normal molecular clouds unless the grain formation rate of h@xmath16 is significantly enhanced ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of a thin envelope can enhance the scattered stellar radiation and thus also the warming @xcite . at the edges of pdrs ,",
    "the main heating agent is the photoelectric effect on grains , with small grains and pahs being particularly effective @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the influence of the effective temperature of the central illuminating star on the gas heating efficiency by very small grains ( grain radius between 4 and 180  ) and pahs .",
    "they showed that the efficiency drops only by a factor of 4 from a star at 10000  k to one at 4000  k. adding the fact that most t  tauri stars exhibit ultraviolet excess and a strong lyman alpha emission line , the effective heating by low mass stars compared to intermediate mass stars should be similar .",
    "the detections of pahs around ab  aur @xcite and hd  135344 @xcite suggest that these large molecules can play a role in the heating of the disks , but quantitative models have not yet been performed .",
    "the gas can attain higher temperatures than the dust in these layers , consistent with our observations , and its emission can emerge from the surfaces even if the mid - plane is optically thick in the mid - infrared continuum .",
    "the efficiency of photoelectric heating decreases significantly , however , if the size of the grains is increased , so the dust size distribution also plays an important factor in this analysis @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the line emission can escape through ` holes ' or ` gaps ' in the disk created by low - mass companion(s ) , e.g. planets or brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "such gaps could also result in a larger surface area intercepted by the radiation . in any case",
    ", the detection of ultraviolet emission from fluorescent h@xmath13 toward other pre - main - sequence stars indicates that ultraviolet radiation plays some role in these systems @xcite . note that this fluorescent h@xmath28 seen in the ultraviolet",
    "must arise from much hotter gas , of order 2000 k , probably located in an inner boundary layer close to the star .",
    "possible heating of h@xmath13 by shocks created by the interaction of a stellar wind with the surface of disks was discussed by @xcite .",
    "a significant constraint is however provided by the non - detection of the h@xmath13 s(3 ) lines in our sources , since shocks tend to populate the high-@xmath164 h@xmath13 levels as well .",
    "shock models by @xcite give much higher h@xmath13 excitation temperatures than observed , making them less plausible .",
    "the most interesting cases are formed by the debris disk objects hd 135344 , @xmath76  pictoris and 49 ceti .",
    "the disks around these objects are considered gas poor based on co observations assuming a h@xmath13/co conversion factor of 10@xmath140 @xcite . for hd 135344 and @xmath165  pictoris , two lines are possibly detected ( in more than 50% of the spectra obtained by our data reduction procedure ) , giving a measure of the temperature and the mass with 10% and 55% uncertainty , respectively , if only the standard 30% calibration errors are considered . for 49  ceti , only the s(0 )",
    "line is seen , leading to an h@xmath13 mass of ( 3.5@xmath1661.9)@xmath8210@xmath167 m@xmath154 if @xmath168  k is assumed .",
    "the derived mass of gas around @xmath76  pictoris is @xmath169 m@xmath154 or @xmath170 0.17@xmath1710.09 m@xmath172 , and it is @xmath24 6.4 @xmath173 m@xmath154 around hd  135344 .",
    "the amount of gas in the @xmath76 pictoris disk is significantly smaller than that for other disks .",
    "the disks are not resolved within the iso - sws beam for hd 135344 and 49 ceti and barely resolved for @xmath76  pictoris .",
    "therefore , the location of the emitting gas is unknown .",
    "the detection of h@xmath28 gas in the @xmath76  pictoris disk may seem surprising since this disk has a very low co / dust mass ratio ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of some neutral gas was , however , invoked by @xcite in order to slow down ions like or leaving the disk since these ions suffer strong radiation pressure from the star .",
    "they considered only as a major species of the stable ring .",
    "the detection of lines together with the measured @xmath174 ratio implies densities of 10@xmath17510@xmath150 @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the density at 40 au in the disk model of @xcite which has m@xmath176 @xmath24 10@xmath177 m@xmath21 , similar to that found here . in their model of debris disks ,",
    "@xcite consider the balance of the formation and destruction of co and h@xmath28 .",
    "their main conclusion is that the co molecule can exist only in the dense part of disks protected from photodissociation whereas h@xmath13 is widely spread .",
    "moreover , co freezes out onto dust in the coldest parts near the midplane , making it a poor tracer of the gas .",
    "if the h@xmath16 detections are valid , nearly all of the gas is at high temperatures ( @xmath178 k ) in the debris disks . since the disk of @xmath35  pictoris has an optical depth less than unity at optical wavelengths , the ultraviolet photons can warm the gas in the entire disk through the photoelectric effect and other processes @xcite .",
    "these gas temperatures are only slightly higher than those derived for the dust components : the spectral energy distributions of @xmath76  pictoris and hd 135344 are well fitted by a single dust temperature of 8090  k @xcite , indicating that these disks are globally warmer than those around t  tauri or herbig ae stars .",
    "the estimated total dust mass around @xmath76  pictoris ranges from 0.3@xmath17910@xmath180 m@xmath154 @xcite to 10@xmath180 m@xmath154 @xcite .",
    "the gas - to - dust mass ratio lies therefore between 45 and 380 , and is much higher than the value of 0.02 derived from co ultraviolet observations .",
    "note that if these co molecules are the evaporation products of infalling comets onto @xmath76  pictoris @xcite , it is not possible to derive the primordial h@xmath28 content of the disk from co.    a pertinent consequence of the presence of gas in debris disks is that it affects the dynamics of the dust in those disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for sufficiently large gas masses , dust generation by collisions of planetesimals will not be possible . for @xmath76 pictoris",
    ", however , the gas mass of @xmath24 0.1 m@xmath172 is small enough that it does not prevent a collisional cascade .",
    "@xcite modeled the evolution of dust grains in disks with gas masses up to a few tens of earth masses , comparable to that found for @xmath76  pictoris .",
    "they show that although grains migrate radially due to radiative pressure and gravity , equilibrium orbits exist for a specific range of grain sizes .",
    "most interestingly , their models can reproduce ring - like disk morphologies with an inner disk clear of small grains .",
    "the similarity of our derived gas / dust ratio for @xmath76 pictoris with the interstellar value of @xmath24100:1 is therefore likely coincidental : some of the dust and gas may have accumulated into ( gaseous ) planets and planetesimals , been expelled from the disk due to radiation pressure , or fallen onto the star by poynting - robertson drag .",
    "we have conducted the first survey of h@xmath13 rotational line emission from disks around a sample of t  tauri and herbig  ae stars and from young stars with debris disk using the iso - sws .",
    "the observed spectra reveal the presence of an unexpectedly large amount ( 0.110 @xmath179 10@xmath118 m@xmath154 ) of molecular gas at @xmath24100  k. no correlations between the warm gas masses with disk masses derived from @xmath7co and 1.3 millimeter emission were found . whereas the bulk of the gas around t  tauri and herbig ae stars is cold , the warm gas may constitute the major gaseous component of debris - disk objects like hd  135344 and @xmath76  pictoris .",
    "there is no apparent difference between the low and the intermediate mass pre - main - sequence stars .",
    "the possible heating mechanisms responsible for the warm gas are discussed .",
    "no process can adequately explain the large amount of warm gas , but the ubiquitous presence of warm h@xmath16 , the higher gas than dust temperatures , and the detection of pahs in few of the objects suggest that a common mechanism like photoelectric heating by ultraviolet radiation could be the main heating agent .",
    "further modeling is needed .",
    "complementary observations of @xmath139co 32 , 65 and @xmath12co 32 have been performed .",
    "the line profiles are resolved and exhibit double - peaked features consistent with gas emitted from a disk in keplerian rotation around a central object . ratios of integrated fluxes of the two isotopomers @xmath139co and @xmath12co show that the @xmath12co 32 line is not highly optically thick and potentially a tracer of the cold component of disks .",
    "the presence of warm gas is supported by the detection of @xmath139co 65 toward a few sources where h@xmath28 has also been found .",
    "the gaseous masses inferred from the @xmath12co intensities are much smaller than those found from the dust continuum emission .",
    "co is likely strongly affected by photodissociation via the stellar and interstellar ultraviolet radiation in the surface layers and freeze - out onto grain surfaces in the midplane .",
    "the h@xmath13 , co and millimeter continuum data together with rough age estimates of our stars allow evolutionary trends to be investigated .",
    "no strong evolution in the masses derived from co , h@xmath13 or dust is found .",
    "there is a large diversity among the stars studied in the ( 110)@xmath181 years range .",
    "the limited number of objects , the limited quality of the iso data and uncertainties in the derived masses prevent definitive conclusions on the gas survival time scale .",
    "the analysis of the h@xmath13 data presented here suffers greatly from limited spatial and spectral resolution as well as sensitivity .",
    "ground - based spectrometers soon to be operational on 810 m class telescopes will be able to study the s(1 ) line at vastly higher spectral and spatial resolution , but will not have access to the ground state para - h@xmath13 transition at 28 @xmath122 m .",
    "moreover , the surface brightness sensitivities of these warm large telescopes is only marginally improved compared with small cryogenic space observatories such as iso .",
    "more complete studies with future air- and space - borne mid - infrared spectrometers on sirtf , sofia , and eventually ngst will greatly improve on our ability to examine the h@xmath13 emission lines from young stars , and properly address the many interesting questions associated with the structure of circumstellar disks and the formation of giant gaseous planets raised in this paper .",

    "<S> we present iso short - wavelength - spectrometer observations of h@xmath0 pure - rotational line emission from the disks around low and intermediate mass pre - main - sequence stars as well as from young stars thought to be surrounded by debris disks . </S>",
    "<S> the pre - main - sequence sources have been selected to be isolated from molecular clouds and to have circumstellar disks revealed by millimeter interferometry . </S>",
    "<S> we detect ` warm ' ( @xmath1  k ) h@xmath0 gas around many sources , including tentatively the debris - disk objects . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of this warm gas ranges from @xmath2 m@xmath3 up to @xmath410@xmath5 m@xmath3 , and can constitute a non - negligible fraction of the total disk mass . </S>",
    "<S> complementary single - dish @xmath6co 32 , @xmath7co 32 and @xmath6co 65 observations have been obtained as well . </S>",
    "<S> these transitions probe cooler gas at @xmath8  2080  k. most objects show a double - peaked co emission profile characteristic of a disk in keplerian rotation , consistent with interferometer data on the lower-@xmath9 lines . the ratios of the @xmath10co 32/@xmath11co 32 integrated fluxes indicate that @xmath10co 32 is optically thick but that @xmath12co 32 is optically thin or at most moderately thick . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath11co 32 lines have been used to estimate the cold gas mass . if a h@xmath13/co conversion factor of 1@xmath1410@xmath15 is adopted , the derived cold gas masses are factors of 10200 lower than those deduced from 1.3 millimeter dust emission assuming a gas / dust ratio of 100 , in accordance with previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> these findings confirm that co is not a good tracer of the total gas content in disks since it can be photodissociated in the outer layers and frozen onto grains in the cold dense part of disks , but that it is a robust tracer of the disk velocity field . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , h@xmath16 can shield itself from photodissociation even in low - mass ` optically thin ' debris disks and can therefore survive longer . </S>",
    "<S> the warm gas is typically 110 % of the total mass deduced from millimeter continuum emission , but can increase up to 100% or more for the debris - disk objects . </S>",
    "<S> thus , residual molecular gas may persist into the debris - disk phase . </S>",
    "<S> no significant evolution in the h@xmath16 , co or dust masses is found for stars with ages in the range of 10@xmath1710@xmath18 years , although a decrease is found for the older debris - disk star @xmath19  pictoris . </S>",
    "<S> the large amount of warm gas derived from h@xmath16 raises the question of the heating mechanism(s ) . </S>",
    "<S> radiation from the central star as well as the general interstellar radiation field heat an extended surface layer of the disk , but existing models fail to explain the amount of warm gas quantitatively . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a gap in the disk can increase the area of material influenced by radiation . </S>",
    "<S> prospects for future observations with ground- and space - borne observations are discussed . </S>"
