    "electron - electron ( e - e ) interaction is known to produce the most pronounced effects in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems , where a strongly correlated state appears even if the interaction is weak .",
    "@xcite a number of attempts were made to treat electron correlations in 1d using the approaches , devised for 2d and 3d .",
    "they are based on the random phase approximation ( rpa ) with various versions of the local field corrections , both static and dynamic .",
    "@xcite these methods give no qualitatively new results as compared to higher dimensions , with the picture of charge excitations being exhausted by common long - wave plasmons .",
    "@xcite however , this way to consider electron correlations has obvious shortcomings , especially in what concerns the dynamic short - range correlations , inherent in 1d .",
    "the flaws of the rpa - like approaches become worse as the dimensionality is reduced .",
    "@xcite in 1d there appear such unphysical results as the negative dynamic form - factor ,  @xcite the violation of the compressibility sum rule and negative pair correlation function , the latter two being also present in 2d and 3d .",
    "@xcite    presently , the most advanced way to treat dynamic electron correlations in 1d is based on the luttinger liquid ( ll ) theory .",
    "@xcite the short - range correlations  @xcite appear here in a natural way , because this model takes properly into account the nesting of the fermi surface for the wave number equal to @xmath1 , with @xmath2 being the fermi wave number .",
    "owing to the short - range correlations , the ll density response contains the @xmath1 component , in addition to the usual long - wave one . in",
    "what follows the @xmath1 term is also referred to as the charge - density wave ( cdw ) .",
    "the @xmath1 susceptibility @xmath3 was considered by luther and peschel  @xcite for the ll with short - ranged e - e interaction .",
    "they have found that @xmath3 diverges as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the velocity of the ll bosonic excitations .",
    "we stress that the divergency of the susceptibility is very important because it corresponds to the presence of a collective mode in the system .    in real 1d structures",
    "e - e interaction is , generally speaking , long - ranged , unless it is screened by a metallic gate .",
    "it is well known that coulomb interaction can highly modify the ground state and transport properties of 1d systems .",
    "thus , in a luttinger liquid with coulomb interaction ( cll ) the static correlations become much stronger than in the short - ranged ll , with the short - range @xmath1 ( @xmath6 in a spinful case ) component being the dominating one .",
    "@xcite    how the dynamic ll correlations are affected by coulomb interaction is the highly intriguing question .",
    "however , considering only the long - wave density component does not lead to the qualitatively new behaviour of the dynamic form - factor and collective modes .",
    "@xcite the results are very close to those obtained in rpa .",
    "the present paper concentrates on the cdw contribution to the dynamic response functions and spectral characteristics of the coulomb luttinger liquid .",
    "we show analytically that coulomb interaction strengthens the divergency of the dynamic density susceptibility in comparison with that of the short - ranged ll .",
    "the singularity of the cdw susceptibility leads to the new behaviour of the collective charge mode that is immanent only in 1d .",
    "the strong spatial dispersion arises in the vicinity of @xmath7 , the mode frequency going to zero as @xmath8 .",
    "this means that the soft mode appears .",
    "such soft mode is absent in 2d and 3d systems , because the short - range dynamic electron correlations are much weaker there .",
    "note that the @xmath1 mode can not be obtained within the rpa approach , even with local field corrections .",
    "our results concerning the cll spectral function diverge from those of ref .  , where it was argued that the non - linear dispersion of bosons , which appears in the presence of coulomb interaction , kills the spectral function singularities . instead , a flattened maximum was found in a spectral function , the position of the maximum being shifted from the resonant frequency .",
    "we show that the coulomb interaction , on the contrary , only strengthens the divergency , which is a rather general result for the cll correlation functions .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we investigate the dynamic density response function , form - factor , spectral function , dissipative conductance , and dielectric function of a cll , comparing them with the short - ranged ll results . in appendices",
    "a and  b the methods to calculate the dynamic form - factor of a short - ranged ll and cll are presented .",
    "we start with a bosonized spinless ll hamiltonian@xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 are boson creation ( annihilation ) operators .",
    "the boson frequency is given by @xmath11 , where the velocity of excitations is @xmath12 , with the interaction parameter @xmath13 , the fermi velocity @xmath14 .",
    "for the short - range interaction @xmath15 is constant ( @xmath16 for e - e repulsion ) , whereas for coulomb interaction in the long - wave limit @xmath17 the interaction parameter is @xmath18^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the electron - density - fluctuation operator in the luttinger model is written as  @xcite @xmath19 @xmath20 being the bosonic phase .",
    "the first component of the density operator , @xmath21 , describes long - wave excitations and represents the sum of the densities of the right- and left - moving electrons .",
    "the corresponding excitations come about separately within each branch of electron spectrum and have momentum @xmath22 . the second component , @xmath23 , which rapidly oscillates in space , is due to the interference of the right- and left - moving electrons .",
    "this corresponds to excitations with momentum @xmath24 .",
    "it is this term that describes the short - range electron correlations .",
    "note that the presented form of @xmath23 differs from the conventional one  @xcite in that the former is the exact differential .",
    "the exact differential form of the density fluctuation operator guarantees the particle number conservation in an isolated 1d system .",

    "neighboring electrons move almost in the same phase , so that the corresponding correlations are almost static .",
    "secondly , electrons suffer the backward scattering from the nearest particles and interfere , which gives rise to @xmath1 density oscillations .",
    "electron correlations that are related to the @xmath1-mechanism of electron density response are essentially dynamic . therefore ,",
    "taking into account the short - range electron correlations , the two - particle wigner function @xmath52 in no way can be represented as a product of two single - particle wigner functions and the _ static _",
    "pair correlation function @xmath53 , that is @xmath54 in 1d .",
    "thus the basic assumption of the singwi - tosi - land - sjlander theory  @xcite is violated in 1d , which explains why the @xmath1 collective mode is overlooked in the excitation spectrum within this approach .",
    "now we turn to the ll dynamic form - factor @xmath55 , which is the fourier transform of the density - density correlator @xmath56 . at zero temperature",
    "the form - factor coincides with the imaginary part of the susceptibility : @xmath57 although the form of the coulomb drf @xmath58 differs dramatically from the short - ranged one , the long - wave part of the form - factor , @xmath59 , has the simple universal expression  @xcite for any dispersion law @xmath60 : @xmath61 thus , only the position of the peak is shifted in a cll .",

    "the cdw form factor can not be calculated exactly , but its general properties are easily understood , using the formula @xmath70 which can be obtained directly from the expression  ( [ r ] ) for the cdw density correlator .",
    "this formula differs from the conventional one  @xcite in that the wave number argument of the @xmath0-function is additionally shifted by @xmath1 .",

    "the state consists of a number of bosons , excited above the vacuum .",
    "the specific form of the matrix element is not of interest now , but what is important is that @xmath74 , in contrast to @xmath75 , is non - zero for excited states , containing more than one boson .",
    "thus all possible boson systems of the total energy @xmath62 and momentum @xmath76 contribute to @xmath63 .",
    "the boson dispersion curve @xmath77 is convex , i.e. @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , if the boson system has the total momentum @xmath79 , then its energy can not be less than @xmath80 .",
    "whence , the form - factor @xmath63 is zero when @xmath81 . when @xmath82 , only one boson can be excited .",
    "as one increases @xmath83 from the threshold value @xmath84 , the number of different boson systems of the given total energy @xmath85 and momentum @xmath76 increases rapidly , and their contribution to the form - factor is increasing too .",
    "the formation of boson systems occurs when @xmath83 is being shifted from the threshold on the scale @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the length of the system .",

    "the last result contradicts to the one obtained in ref .  , where it was claimed that the nonlinear boson dispersion flattens the singularity of @xmath97 at @xmath98 , producing a maximum instead , with @xmath97 going to zero at the resonant frequency .",

    "the static form - factor was calculated via direct integration of the static density - density correlator to give @xmath101    the dynamic form - factor determines the power @xmath102 that is dissipated in a ll , disturbed by external electric potential  @xmath103 : @xmath104    the contribution of the long - wave density response to the dissipated power was investigated in detail in ref .  .",

    "indeed , the boson excitations are non - interacting in the frame of the luttinger model .",
    "they can not decay into landau quasi - particles either .",
    "hence , there is no possibility for a collective mode in a cll to transfer its energy to some other excitations and thus to damp .",
    "this is clear with the bosonization approach , which explains also why the usual long - wave plasmons are not damping in 1d .",
    "an important conclusion is that the mode frequency goes to zero at @xmath118 , in other words , the mode is soft .",
