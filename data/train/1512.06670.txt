    "recently both the atlas and the cms collaborations have reported an excess of @xmath5 events at the lhc run-@xmath6 with a center - of - mass energy @xmath7  tev @xcite .",
    "this excess emerges with a bump in the di - photon invariant mass spectrum around @xmath8  gev over the predicted continuous falling background .",
    "the atlas collaboration used @xmath9 fb@xmath10 of data and the local ( global ) significance is @xmath11 .",
    "the cms collaboration observed a local ( global ) significance as @xmath12 with @xmath13 fb@xmath10 of data .",
    "the observed events have quite similar kinematic properties with the background events in this spectrum region .",
    "even though a clearer picture requires more data , it is still worth studying the possible hint from this excess . considering the current volume of data sample ,",
    "a rough estimation of the cross - section @xmath14 is of a few fb .",
    "landau - yang theorem excludes the di - photon resonance from being vector boson and only spin-@xmath15 or spin-@xmath6 resonance can be viable candidate .",
    "@xmath16-graviton predicts similar order of di - lepton decay which may suffer from direct constrain @xcite . if the excess arises from a spin-@xmath15 resonance , candidate can be realized among fundamental scalar , a pion - like @xmath17 or an @xmath0-like resonance .",
    "direct searches via @xmath18 or @xmath19 put stringent bound over the heavy higgs - like scalar @xcite and a cp - odd higgs @xmath20 is then more plausible . minimal model with cp - odd higgs suffers from huge suppression of decay branching fraction because of decrease in @xmath5 partial width due to lack of @xmath21-loop contribution and enhancement of total width from on - shell @xmath3 decay .",
    "many papers have been published to discuss the implications of the di - photon resonance @xcite which cover proposals as cp - odd higgs with exotic quark , sneutrino with @xmath22-parity violation , pseduo - scalar from chiral symmetry breaking of new strong dynamics .",
    "a proton - proton collider like lhc is typically a quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) machine where new physics in the strong interaction sector will appear in the early stages of operation even with limited luminosity .",
    "the recent di - photon anomaly can well be a signal as onia formed by massive meta - stable colored and charged ( mmcc ) states . for a mmcc state @xmath23 ,",
    "if the total width @xmath24 , the particle @xmath23 could form a hadronic bound state long before it decays . since @xmath23 is colored , it can be produced in pair as @xmath25 at the lhc and they will form hadronic states as for instance @xmath26 with light quarks from vacuum .",
    "in addition , near the threshold , they can form hadronic bound state @xmath27 as scalar onium .",
    "the onium @xmath28 is produced through gluon fusion and decay into photon pair , pp _",
    "q  . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath23 is fermionic , the hadronic bound states include both scalar and vector states in analogy to @xmath29 and @xmath30 case @xcite",
    ". the vector state will not only decay into di - photon but also decay into di - lepton which suffers from severe constraint of direct searches at lhc .",
    "however the @xmath0-like state can be produced via gluon fusion @xmath31 while the @xmath30-like state can only be produced through @xmath32 annihilation , therefore the production of the vector state is significantly lower than that of the scalar state at the lhc .",
    "taking this into account , it requires more study on the lhc constraints on vector bound state of @xmath25 for fermionic @xmath23 . in the following we discuss only scalar mmcc cases .",
    "we investigate three categories of such scalar mmcc to illustrate the feature .",
    "the next section , we focus on stoponium resonance from light stop of compressed supersymmetry .",
    "then we discuss the other two color exotics , color sextet scalar as diquark and the color octet scalars and their constraints .",
    "we then discuss the di - photon prediction of diquarkonium formed by long - lived diquark / anti - diquark pair and the octectonium formed by color - octet scalars .",
    "we then conclude in the final section .",
    "a first well - known example of such scalar mmcc state is a stop in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "when meta - stable stops are produced in pair at colliders , stoponium can be formed near threshold @xcite and stoponium can decay into @xmath33 , @xmath19 @xmath5 _ etc . _ through annihilation . here",
    "we briefly summarize the di - photon signal from stoponium at the lhc which was studied in @xcite .    as a consequence of large top yukawa , third generation squarks",
    "are typically the lightest among the sfermion spectrum and can even be the next lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) .",
    "in compressed susy model , the mass difference between stop and lightest neutralino , @xmath34 , can be of a few gev .",
    "therefore , stop can only decay through loop or four - body _ 1c^0_1 ,  _",
    "1b ^0_1  .",
    "the total width of stop is only of @xmath2(kev ) which is less than @xmath35 .",
    "when being produced , such stop will form hadronic state as @xmath22-hadron , which is the composite colorless state of colored metastable superparticles with light quarks . however",
    ", if stop decay within the tracking system , most of the @xmath22-hadron searches do not apply .",
    "in addition , the stop decay is largely into neutralino with extremely soft objects like @xmath36-meson .",
    "the pair production signal is mostly large missing transverse energy @xmath37 .",
    "the only bound then comes from @xmath38 and the signal is mono - jet plus @xmath37 . without any kinematic handle , bound on such final state is rather weak .",
    "dark matter annihilation is mainly through @xmath39 but may also have @xmath40 co - annihilation and it s not difficult to obtain the viable parameter region with correct relic density @xcite .    on the other hand , pair production of stop",
    "does not necessarily lead to large @xmath37 which is common signature for all @xmath22-parity conserving mssm .",
    "stop production near threshold can also form hadronic bound state as stoponium @xmath41 as a typical example of squarkonium @xcite .",
    "the stoponium can decay into @xmath33 , @xmath5 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath42 , @xmath3 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 by annihilation .",
    "the stoponium production rate can be estimated from higgs production from gluon fusion by scaling from ratio of partial width @xmath45 .",
    "a comprehensive phenomenology study has been performed by @xcite . however , at 14  tev lhc , the predicted @xmath46 is about 0.05  fb for @xmath47  gev which is much less than the required rate to account for the current di - photon excess .",
    "detailed calculations for stoponium production and decays to @xmath5 or @xmath19 are also presented in @xcite .",
    "a recent lattice study on the origin of the stoponium wave function @xcite indicates that the stoponium production rate may be about @xmath48 times larger than the potential model calculation @xcite adopted in @xcite , which is still far too small to accommodate the lhc di - photon excess .",
    "since the stoponium prediction is much lower to account for the excess , one would need large enhancement in production or di - photon decay . in this session",
    ", we discuss the scalar color exotics . in minimal extension ,",
    "scalar exotics decay into fermionic quark pairs . under @xmath49 , & = & 6 + 3|3 & = & 8  .",
    "therefore , the scalar color exotics can only be sextet , anti - triplet and octet under @xmath50 .",
    "the above color structure corresponds to the following lorentz structure respectively as    the global fermion number @xmath51 while the second term corresponds to fermion number conservation .",
    "the @xmath52 field can be identified as sextet or anti - triplet scalar while the @xmath53 field can be identified as singlet or octet .",
    "sextet and anti - triplet scalar both couple to quark quark pairs and hence are called diquark . taking @xmath54",
    ", it is straightforward to conclude that diquark @xmath52 couples to the same chiral field while the field @xmath53 couples to spinor with different chirality . under @xmath55",
    ", diquark @xmath52 can be either triplet or singlet while @xmath53 can only be doublet .",
    "the anti - triplet diquark sometimes can be identified as scalar quark in supersymmetric theory .",
    "if @xmath22-parity is violated , squark can decay into quark pair through superpotential @xmath56 coupling . on the other hand , stoponium in the previous session",
    "already gives the maximal prediction among squarkonia states .",

    "all the diquark states are charged under electromagnetic interaction and hence , non - zero vacuum expectation value is strictly forbidden for diquarks .",
    "diquark carries non - zero @xmath70 baryon number while the @xmath71 triplet state in eq .",
    "( [ triplet ] ) carries non - zero @xmath72 lepton number .",
    "when @xmath71 triplet acquire vacuum expectation value during symmetry breaking , majorana neutrino mass naturally arises and lepton number is violated by two units . due to @xmath73 gauge symmetry , the lepton number violation can also be converted into baryon number violation l=2",
    "however , such @xmath74 violation does not lead to proton decay which is @xmath75 and @xmath76 effect , @xmath77 violation only leads to neutron - anti - neutron ( @xmath78 ) oscillation and the electroweak scale diquark is fully compatible with present limits @xcite .",
    "in addition , such diquark also helps in post - sphaleron baryogenesis @xcite .    the diquark decay through yukawa coupling f_u^t_r c^-1 u_r ^_6   with the width as @xcite _ ij = 38(1+_ij ) |f_ij|^2 m__6 ^1/2(1,r^2_i , r^2_j)(1-r^2_i - r^2_j ) where @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the yukawa couplings are typically constrained by flavor physics .",
    "for instance , for the @xmath55 singlet with only coupling to the up - type quarks as @xmath81 , the most stringent bounds on the couplings @xmath82 come from @xmath83 mixing , to which @xmath84 would make a tree level contribution proportional to @xmath85 .",
    "the off - diagonal coupling @xmath82 will contribute to flavor violation processes , for instance @xmath86 which is proportional to @xmath87 .",
    "the current bounds require that f_11 f_22 10 ^ -6 ; f_11 f_12 10 ^ -2 , for @xmath88 of a few hundred gev to tev mass range @xcite .",
    "less stringent constraint comes from one loop process as @xmath89 . to escape from the bound",
    ", the charm - related couplings should be negligible . in the region of @xmath90 ,",
    "@xmath91 decay width is less than @xmath92 @xcite and @xmath91 becomes meta - stable .",
    "we first use the @xmath93 to illustrate the feature then scale down to other sextet diquarkonia . near threshold , @xmath94 can form diquarkonium @xmath95 which would decay dominantly into the @xmath33 channel . since @xmath93 is a @xmath55 singlet",
    ", @xmath95 decays also into @xmath5 , @xmath96 and @xmath19 , with the latter two channels suppressed by @xmath97 and @xmath98 in comparison to the di - photon channel .",
    "therefore @xmath99 .    since the gluon fusion production of such diquarkonium is proportional to the partial width @xmath100 , at leading order , the production rate is = ( _ gg)(hgg )  .",
    "we find the partial decay width of @xmath101 at leading order as ( _ gg)=50 _ s^2 3 r(0)^2 m^2 _ _  , in which the numerical factor is @xmath102 times larger than that of @xmath103 . here",
    "@xmath104 is the radial wave function at the origin .",
    "the large color - factor enhancement in the above digluon decay comes from the relation @xmath105 in the fundamental representation while @xmath106 in the sextet representation of @xmath49 .",
    "the factor @xmath107 arises from the normalization of the wave function at color space , which is @xmath108 for diquarkonium and @xmath109 for stoponium .",
    "similarly , the di - photon decay width at leading order is ( _ ) = 1024 ^2 27 r(0)^2 m^2 _ _  , in which the numerical factor is @xmath110 times larger than that of @xmath111 . here",
    "part of the enhancement ( factor of @xmath112 ) comes from the diquark electric charge which is twice larger than that of stop , another factor of 2 enhancement is due to the fact that there are six colors for diquarks instead of three colors for stops .",
    "it is expected that @xmath104 of diquarkonium should be larger than that of stoponium , because of the stronger perturbative color interactions between diquarks .",
    "intuitively , for such a heavy onium , the potentials of both stoponium and diquarkonium should be essentially coulombic and therefore calculable in a model - independent way .",
    "however both the potential model estimation @xcite and the recent lattice study @xcite on the stoponium wave function exhibit substantial departure from coulombic limit . for the case of diquarkonium",
    ", only potential model estimation is available @xcite : it was estimated as @xmath113 gev for a @xmath8 gev diquarkonium .",
    "using the potential model estimation of the wave function at the origin , we then find @xmath114 to be about @xmath115 fb for @xmath116 gev at 13  tev lhc , which may be slightly larger to account for the lhc di - photon excess .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath117 is predicted to be about @xmath118 pb and is within the experimental bounds @xcite .    scaling by fourth power of electric charge , one can also obtain ( pp _ ^-2/3 ) & = & 116 ( pp _ ^+4/3 ) + ( pp _ ^+1/3 ) & = & 1256 ( pp _ ^+4/3 )  . the prediction of @xmath119 is then too small to account for the lhc di - photon excess   to be @xmath120 times larger than the potential model estimation , just like the case of stoponium reported in @xcite , the diquarkonium formed by another color - sextet @xmath63 singlet higgs @xmath121 could be a candidate to interpret the lhc di - photon excess with @xmath122 predicted to be around @xmath120 fb . ] .",
    "another example of exotic onium is color - singlet octetonium formed by a pair of color - octet scalars @xmath123 with the quantum numbers @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "such octectonium state has been carefully studied in @xcite .",
    "the di - photon and digluon decay widths of this octetonium at the leading order can be found as ( _ 8 ) & = 16 ^2 r(0)^2 m^2__8  , + ( _ 8 gg)&=18 _ s^2r(0)^2 m^2__8  , with @xmath125 gev @xcite for a @xmath8 gev octetonium . in addition , total decay width of octectonium also depends on the yukawa coupling @xmath126 due to new decay channel @xcite such as top quark pairs and @xmath127 can well be of the right magnitude to explain the lhc di - photon excess as in @xcite for some choice of @xmath126 .",
    "as a qcd machine , the large production rates of color exotics enable the possibility of early discovery or put stringent bounds on such color exotics based on existing data from lhc or tevatron .    in the case of supersymmetric theory ,",
    "if @xmath22-parity is not broken , the final state of the cascade decay is always a stable particle with odd @xmath22-parity .",
    "constrained by astrophysics and cosmology , such stable particle must be electric neutral and the color singlet thus can be identified as the dark matter candidate .",
    "such final state then appears as missing transverse energy @xmath37 .",
    "as we discussed , the pair production of stop in compressed supersymmetry leads to monojet plus @xmath37 which does not have much kinematic handle .    on the other hand , without such parity , color exotics as diquark or color octet scalars",
    "will then decay into quark pairs .",
    "if the exotics decay into light jets , pair production of such exotics then leads to four jets final states with two di - jet resonance and the production rate with 375  gev resonance is about 36  pb @xcite for color sextet diquark and slightly high for octet states .",
    "since the four jets arise from heavy resonance decay , the four jets are all of high @xmath128 which can significantly reduce the sm four jets background .",
    "lhc run - i has excluded coloron octet up to 800  gev and anti - triplet diquark up to 350  gev @xcite . the sextet diquark production rate is slightly lower than the octet and the 375  gev diquark decaying into dijet must be excluded already .",

    "the diquark with electric charge @xmath130 can also decay into same - sign top quark pair as @xmath131 .",
    "the pair production of diquark then leads to four top final state , in particular , with same - sign di - lepton plus jets and @xmath37 which fall into the regular supersymmetric majorana gluino search or sgluon search and such light diquark states suffer from severe constraint of gluino bound  @xcite .",
    "the sgluon pair with decay into four - top final state has completely excluded such possibility  @xcite .    on the other hand , if the decay final state consists of one top quark , the pair production will then fall into @xmath3 plus jets .",
    "for instance , @xmath132 dominates the @xmath93 or @xmath133 dominates the @xmath134 couplings or charged color octet scalars @xmath135 with large top coupling",

    "even for 14  tev lhc , the production is less than 5% of the sm prediction of @xmath3 with invariant mass peak at the sm @xmath3 threshold .",
    "therefore , we argue the color exotics with decay into one top quark plus a light jet may completely be buried in the sm @xmath3 samples .",
    "such resonance with @xmath140 decay requires @xmath4 reconstruction which has been carried in @xcite .",
    "the resonant @xmath4 reconstruction was designed to search for @xmath141 with @xmath142 production and @xmath143 . for @xmath4 invariant mass @xmath144  gev ,",
    "the exclusion limit is over 10  pb for 7  tev lhc by atlas . due to phase - space suppression ,",

    "the production rate for the spin-1/2 exotic quark is about 3 pb for @xmath147  gev at 7  tev and very close to the production rate of sextet diquark .",
    "we then argue the exclusion can be directly applied here and the light diquark decay into top plus jet can evade the cms search in @xcite .",
    "however , color octet scalars @xmath148 form a @xmath71 doublet with two physical states .",

    "the neutral state @xmath150 has been excluded by the four - top sgluon search  @xcite and @xmath151 has been excluded by the four light jets search  @xcite .    on the other hand , the above constraints are all due to the case with prompt decay .",
    "long - lived particle(llp ) searches on the lhc are very dependent on the estimated proper decay length , electric charge and llp masses . both the atlas and cms collaborations",
    "have published constrains on llps with various strategies , including specific energy loss@xcite , time of flight@xcite , displaced vertex@xcite , hcal detection@xcite and stopped decay@xcite .",
    "the very features of llps are large ionisation energy loss rate @xmath152 and long time of flight .",
    "heavy exotics @xmath91 and @xmath145 are produced with small velocities , some even reaching a non - relativistic region .",
    "they hadronize immediately into colorless bound states with different electric charges .",
    "the small @xmath153 values of charged states lead to an anomalously large energy loss rate measured in the tracker . in the meantime ,",
    "if they have lifetime greater than @xmath2(ns ) , they could traverse the whole detector and leave a signal with large time of flight measured in the muon detector .",
    "these events are generally selected out with either a muon trigger or a calorimeter - based @xmath154 trigger . in the muon trigger case",
    ", the charged colorless bound states would fake heavy muon - like signals in the muon system .",
    "further analysis could incorporate their distinctive energy loss rate for the particle identification .",
    "even if they decay before hitting on the outmost layer , the decay products should not include top quarks as the muon leptons from top decays may still trigger the event selection algorithm .",
    "so @xmath145 which decays to @xmath3 or @xmath149 can hardly escape the full - detector search strategy .",
    "however , the charged bound states could interact with the detector material and eventually arrive as a neutral state .",
    "then @xmath154 trigger works as a compensation in this case .",
    "for example , in the atlas @xmath22-hadron search , gluino mass is excluded to 1270  gev with the full - detector information and 1260  gev with the muon - agnostic information @xcite .",
    "we assume the @xmath93 is metastable and focus on its searches in the following .",
    "metastable sextet diquarks form neutral , singly and doubly charged hadrons like @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 soon after their production and decay as , for instance , x^++(_6u)p^++^+  .",
    "displaced decay searches are sensitive to multi - jet signals in the tracker volume .",

    "the production cross - section limit depends on the mean proper decay length of x , but always below that of @xmath91 pair production . as the upper exclusion mass limit is very close to 375  gev , we assume technically it can be extended to probe such mass region . in the scenario where the llps could traverse the tracker and",
    "then decay into light jet pairs in the calorimeters , more calorimeter - based strategies are effective . though the previous jet pair resonance search does nt apply here because of the strict reconstructed primary vertex requirement for a four jets event@xcite , such high @xmath159 jet events are recorded and it s easy to check whether a resonance could be reconstructed .",
    "moreover , the atlas calorimeter signal searches covers a radius from the outer ecal to the hcal and looks for metastable neutral particles that decay in this region@xcite .",
    "the production cross section limit covers a mass region up to 150  gev for a pair of such neutral states decaying from a heavy hidden scalar .",
    "the cms displaced decay and atlas hcal decay searches are designed for neutral llps , but we expect the charged hadronic states that would inevitably leave significant charged tracks are detectable within these methods which has never been reported . at last , there s a scenario where bound states with small @xmath160 values may stop in the detectable region due to the energy loss when interacting with detector material .",
    "then there should be an upper lifetime limit set by the out - of - time decay searches where none active event is expected in the detector@xcite .",
    "in general , one expects much more severe bound over the charged llp in comparison with neutral llp which is already excluded up to 1.2 tev for octet @xcite .",
    "in summary , we discuss the interpretation of the recent di - photon excess as onia of massive meta - stable colored and charged particles .",
    "to escape from the stringent bound on di - lepton final states from vector onia decays , the onia should be formed by scalar particles .",
    "one example is stoponium which has been discussed in details in @xcite , however the predicted di - photon signal is significantly smaller than the required rate to explain the lhc di - photon excess .",
    "we then consider various color exotics as sextet diquark or color octet scalar .",
    "diphoton from octetonium can well be of the right magnitude to explain the lhc di - photon excess as in @xcite for some parameter choice .",
    "diquarkonium formed by color sextet diquark with electric charge to be @xmath161 also predicts the di - photon signal as 12 fb at 13 tev lhc with the enhancement from color factor and electric charge . on the other hand ,",

    "<S> motivated by the recent di - photon excess by both atlas and cms collaborations at the lhc , we systematically investigate the production and di - photon decay of onia formed by pair of all possible color exotic scalars in minimal extension . </S>",
    "<S> when such scalar massive meta - stable colored and charged ( mmcc ) particles are produced in pair near threshold , @xmath0 onium can be formed and decay into di - photon through annihilation as @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> squarkonium is formed by meta - stable squarks in supersymmetric models such as stoponium . </S>",
    "<S> diquarkonium is formed by meta - stable color sextet diquarks which may be realized in the pati - salam model . </S>",
    "<S> octetonium is formed by color octet scalars bosons as in the manohar - wise model . </S>",
    "<S> stoponium prediction is much smaller than the required signal to account for the di - photon excess . </S>",
    "<S> due to the enhancement factor from color and electric charge , predictions of diquarkonium and octetonium are of @xmath2(10  fb ) which are significantly greater than the stoponium prediction . </S>",
    "<S> since the color enhancement also results in large production at the colliders , such light color exotic states of @xmath2(375  gev ) suffer from severe direct search constraints . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if their dominant decay mode involve top quark , they may be buried in the @xmath3 plus jets samples and can potentially be searched via @xmath4 resonance . </S>"
