    "<S> + elasticity of complex fluids and their viscoelastic behaviour has been tackled mostly by rheological measurements so far @xcite . in general </S>",
    "<S> , these methods allow the study of frequency dependent storage @xmath7 and loss @xmath8 modulus . </S>",
    "<S> the former describes the elastic contribution , while the latter covers dissipative processes upon shear . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a non - vanishing @xmath9 in the limit @xmath10 indicates a solid . </S>",
    "<S> these quantities have been investigated extensively by experiment as well as theory @xcite , and from the data , a clear distinction between solid and fluid state might be drawn . </S>",
    "<S> this is also true for flow curves , which might be not only acquired by conventional rheometers but also by microfluidic rheology @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we address solely the elasticity by internal fluctuations without external driving . + </S>",
    "<S> while it has been shown recently that the zero - frequency shear modulus @xmath11 is a good quantity to observe the glass transition @xcite , there has been an ongoing debate on the behaviour of @xmath6 when an amorphous solid forms . </S>",
    "<S> replica theory approaches @xcite predict a continuous growth from zero upon cooling . </S>",
    "<S> this agrees with the view from granular systems , where theory predicts critical fluctuations close to the jamming transition of these athermal systems which also lead to an algebraic growth of @xmath6 from zero @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> another recent replica theory calculation reveals a discontinuous jump at the glass transition @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this complies with mode coupling theory predictions @xcite where @xmath6 is connected to a non - ergodicity parameter appearing in a stress auto - correlation function . a discussion about the discontinuous elasticity in the context of random first - order transition is given in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , simulations of hard discs also showed a discontinuous onset of the shear modulus @xcite by accessing the system with the equipartition theorem . </S>",
    "<S> similar results from novel four - point correlation calculations back this up further @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + here , we evaluate microscopy data from a two dimensional colloidal model system with soft interactions in equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> this gives us access to information on the single particle scale as opposed to atomic or molecular systems , where only ensemble data may be studied . by determining the displacement field and subsequent analysis in fourier space , </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion relations of acoustic - like excitations are obtained and provide insight into the macroscopic elastic properties of the system . as the system is cooled , we are able to confirm the discontinuous nature of the shear modulus at the glass transition . </S>"
