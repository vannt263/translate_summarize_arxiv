    "the large @xmath0 asymptotics of the hankel functions @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and the bessel functions @xmath3 , @xmath4 , beside theoretical and practical importance , have historical significance . in 1909 , debye @xcite developed the method of steepest descents to deduce asymptotic expansions for these functions with fixed @xmath5 as @xmath6 .",
    "since then , these expansions become standard textbook examples to illustrate various techniques , such as the method of steepest descents itself or the method of stationary phase ( see , for example , copson ( * ? ? ? * and pp .",

    "nevertheless , the derivation of his results is based on interpretive , rather than rigorous , methods .",
    "the drawback of debye s expansions is their non - uniformity in @xmath9 .",

    "two years later , he published new asymptotic expansions for the hankel and bessel functions that are uniformly valid for all @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "it might be supposed therefore that there is no need for the non - uniform expansions of debye and that little could be added to their well - established theory .",
    "the uniformity of the expansion is an important property , however , in general , uniform asymptotic expansions have much more complicated forms than non - uniform expansions .",

    "resurgence has to be understood in the sense of berry and howls , meaning that the function reappears in the remainder of its own asymptotic series . using these representations , we obtain several new properties of debye s classical expansions , including explicit and numerically computable error bounds , asymptotics for the late coefficients , exponentially improved asymptotic expansions , and the smooth transition of the stokes discontinuities .",
