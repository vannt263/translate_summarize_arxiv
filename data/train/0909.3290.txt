    "despite convincing evidence for confinement in yang - mills theories from lattice gauge calculations and despite a host of analytical studies and conjectures , the intricacies of non - abelian gauge fields have prevented an unambiguous identification of the mechanism of confinement .",
    "in particular , the gauge dependence of many of the mechanisms proposed constitutes a severe obstacle in reaching this goal .",
    "i will choose a different path towards understanding confinement .",
    "i will describe construction and analysis of ensembles of gauge fields which exhibit confinement and account for other facets of the dynamics of su(2 ) yang mills theory .",
    "the studies to be presented are based on the ideas that instantons @xcite or merons @xcite , solutions of the classical yang - mills equations , play a prominent role also in the quantum theory @xcite .",
    "they are related to investigations which led to the instanton gas and liquid models @xcite which successfully describe a variety of phenomena of strong interaction physics @xcite .",
    "these models however miss confinement , the trademark of the dynamics of yang - mills fields .",
    "i will discuss an alternative construction of ensembles of gauge - fields obtained by superposition of `` regular gauge '' instantons or of merons @xcite . although irrelevant for single instanton properties , the choice of either the regular or the singular gauge in the superposition of instantons leads to two different phases , the gas or liquid phase of singular gauge instantons with a well defined low density limit and the strongly correlated confining phase of regular gauge instantons ( or merons ) .",
    "after appropriate choice of the coordinate system in color space and after regularization of the singularity , the su(2 ) gauge field for a meron or an ( regular gauge ) instanton in lorenz gauge with the center at the origin , is given by @xmath0 with the pauli matrices @xmath1 , the t hooft tensor @xmath2 @xcite , and with @xmath3 denoting merons and @xmath4 instantons .",
    "the size parameter @xmath5 controls the short distance behavior of instanton and meron fields . for instantons , and for merons with vanishing @xmath5",
    ", @xmath6 is a solution of the euclidean classical field equations @xcite .",
    "important for the following are the infrared properties of the constituents .",
    "the gauge fields of a single meron and of a single regular gauge instanton behave asymptotically as @xmath7 while the asymptotics of the field strengths , @xmath8 = \\partial_{\\mu } a^a_{\\nu}-\\partial_{\\nu } a^a_{\\mu}+ \\epsilon^{abc}a^b_{\\mu}a^c_{\\nu}\\,,\\ ] ] is different for merons and instantons @xmath9 due to the cancellation of the abelian and non - abelian contributions to leading order for instantons",
    ". therefore the action density @xmath10 behaves asymptotically as @xmath11 and @xmath12 for merons and instantons respectively and gives rise to an infinite action for merons .",
    "the topological charge density is defined by @xmath13 and yields a finite value for the topological charge @xmath14 the fast asymptotic decrease of the field strength of an instanton is the basis for the alternate representation of instantons in `` singular gauge '' @xmath15 where the gauge field decays asymptotically as @xmath16 and @xmath17 denotes the anti - self - dual thooft tensor .",
    "the su(2 ) gauge fields to be considered are superpositions of instanton or meron fields @xmath18 the dynamical variables of these fields are the positions of the centers @xmath19 of the instantons or merons and their color orientations @xmath20 in general , the action of gauge fields generated by superposition of either merons or instantons is logarithmically divergent in the infrared . by a judicious choice of the color orientation , finite values of the total action can be obtained .",
    "this is achieved , e.g. , by the following superposition of 4 instanton or merons @xmath21 with the color rotations @xmath22 by @xmath23 around the three color directions @xmath24 . with this choice @xmath25 \\sim \\frac{1}{x^3}\\,,\\quad s(x)\\sim \\frac{1}{x^6 }    \\ , , \\label{asy}\\ ] ] the system is `` neutral '' and the action is finite .",
    "the constituents , instantons or merons , are `` confined '' .",
    "removal of a single constituent gives rise to an infinite action .",
    "thus ensembles of instantons and merons exhibit similar infrared properties and in both cases strong correlations between the constituents are required to guarantee a finite action .    the ensembles of gauge fields ( cf.eq.([supo ] ) ) to be constructed in the following",

    "background and single meron contributions to the total action are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "unlike in the superposition of singular instantons , the appearance of single meron or instanton structures is not automatic , it rather reflects the dynamics defined by the partition function ( [ pathintegral ] ) .",
    "this becomes evident in the comparison ( fig.[meracd ] ) with the action density of a meron field of the corresponding stochastic ensemble ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the values of the action density of the two ensembles @xmath36 differ by almost two orders of magnitude . as a result of of the huge background generated by the stochastic superposition of the constituents no single meron contribution ( @xmath37 )",
    "can be identified .",
    "the maximum close to the center of fig.[meracd ] is a result of the stochastic superposition as can be verified in an analytical calculation .",
    "the reduction of the action from the strong coupling value is a first quantitative signature of the importance of correlations in the ( @xmath38 ) ensembles .",
    "another measure of the strength of the correlations between constituents is the response of the action to changes of the color orientation or of the position of a single meron or instanton @xcite . as shown in fig.[chac ] , under variations of the color orientation of a single constituent the total action is increased by up to @xmath39 and by up to @xmath40 under variations of the position . in a weakly interacting system of 50 instantons ( instanton gas )",

    "the large difference in the dimensionless ratios formed by action density and string tension , @xmath56 reflects the different dynamics of the ensembles . as in lattice gauge theories , confinement in the strong coupling limit",
    "is a result of disorder of the system generated by the unconstrained fluctuations of the gauge fields .",
    "suppression of the fluctuations if @xmath38 affects more strongly the local action density than the non local - wilson loop and in turn leads to the strong decrease in the ratio @xmath57",
    ". only minor changes of wilson loops are obtained if , in addition to the color orientations , also the meron positions are treated as dynamical variables .",
    "this result is in accordance with the above findings concerning the response to changes in the color orientation and position ( fig.[chac ] ) of single constituents .",
    "it suggests that the confining phase is a close relative of the nematic phase of liquid crystals with strong correlations in internal and comparatively weak correlations in position space @xcite .",

    "it is remarkable that superposition of the gauge equivalent regular and singular instantons gives rise to two distinctively different phases , the gas or liquid phase generated by singular and the confining phase by regular gauge instantons respectively .",

    "the infrared behavior of the constituents is not only the source of confinement it s scale independence also induces the scaling properties of observables under changes in the number of constituents . besides various properties of wilson loops , such as the area law ,",
    "casimir scaling or flux tube formation , also the action density ( gluon condensate ) and the topological susceptibility are reasonably well reproduced .",
    "these latter quantities are determined by the relative strength of the gauge fields close to the center of the constituents and of the background gauge field generated by the superposition of the constituents . if observables such as the topological susceptibility are dominated by single instanton properties similar results in the liquid and in the confining phase can be expected .",
    "limits in the applicability of meron and instanton ensembles are encountered if short distance properties are important as is the case for the glueball spectrum and for small size wilson loops .",
