    "the latter is a @xmath3-algebra while the former is far from one ; we will exploit this difference in what follows .    in this paper , we will primarily be concerned with one prominent non - commutative norm inequality : the _ haagerup inequality_. it first arose in @xcite , where it was the main estimate used to foster an example of a non - nuclear @xmath4-algebra with the metric approximation property . in the context of that paper ,",
    "haagerup s inequality takes the following form :    [ classical haagerup inequality ] let @xmath5 be the free group on @xmath6 generators , and let @xmath7 be a function supported on the subspace generated by words in @xmath5 of length @xmath8 .",
    "then @xmath9 acts as a convolutor on @xmath10 , and its convolution norm @xmath11 satisfies @xmath12    note that the convolution product is just the usual product in the von neumann algebra generated by the left - regular representation of @xmath5 ( known as the _ free group factor @xmath13 _ ) , and so in the language of operator algebras , the statement is that the ( non - commutative ) @xmath14-norm controls the operator norm on subspaces of uniform finite word - length , where the bound grows _",
    "linearly _ with word - length .",
    "the haagerup inequality , and its decendents , have played important roles in several different fields . in the context of geometric group theory ,",
    "the haagerup inequality ( and other constructions presented in @xcite ) have evolved into _ a - t - menability _ or _ property t _",
    "@xcite ; in the context of lie theory , haagerup s inequality is related to _ property rd _ @xcite .",
    "it has proved useful for other operator algebraic applications : in @xcite , lafforgue uses the haagerup inequality as a crucial tool in his proof of the baum - connes conjecture for cocompact lattices in @xmath15 ; in this context , the precise order of growth of the haagerup constant is immaterial ( so long as it is polynomial ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the haagerup inequality has proved useful in studying return probabilities and other statistics of random walks on groups ( see @xcite ) , where the exact form of the haagerup constant is important .",
    "our main theorem , theorem [ main theorem ] below , is a strong haagerup inequality in a general `` holomorphic '' setting ",
    "i.e.  a non - self - adjoint algebra . in the special case of the free group factor",
    ", this amounts to considering convolution operators which involve only generators of the group , not their inverses ; the resulting haagerup inequality ( corollary [ corollary free semigroup haagerup inequality ] below ) then has growth of order @xmath16 , where @xmath8 is the word - length .",
    "there are two main approaches to norm estimates in such a setting .",
    "a direct one ( as used in the original approach of haagerup ) is to work directly in the concrete representation of the considered element as operator on a hilbert space and try to estimate the operator norm by considering the action of the operator on vectors .",
    "a more indirect approach is by recovering the operator norm as the limit of the @xmath1-norms as @xmath17 , and therefore trying to get a combinatorial understanding of @xmath1-norms for @xmath18 even .",
    "it is the latter approach which we take .",
    "thus , we need a good ( at least asymptotic ) understanding of the moments of the involved operators with respect to the underlying state . to our benefit ,",
    "the moments of the generators of free groups possess a lot of structure : namely the generators are free in the sense of voiculescu s free probability theory .",
    "our strong haagerup inequality is actually derived in a much more general setting : algebras generated by free @xmath0-diagonal elements .",
    "we therefore handle not only the original framework of haagerup ( in the form of free haar unitaries ) , but also free circular elements , and a wealth of other non - normal operators .",
    "there have been some predecessor of our strong haagerup inequality for the general @xmath0-diagonal case .",
    "namely , the one - dimensional case was mainly addressed in @xcite and , in particular , in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite contains a very specialized multi - dimensional case , where the considered operator is a product of identically - distributed free @xmath0-diagonal elements .",
    "all these results relied on analytic techniques , using the theory of @xmath0- and @xmath19-transforms for probability measures on @xmath20 .",
    "however , in the genuine non - commutative case of polynomials in several non - commuting @xmath0-diagonal elements , as we treat it here , such analytical tools are unavailable to us , and so our analysis will rely on the combinatorial machinery of free cumulants , as powered by free probability theory .",
    "our main tool is the moment - cumulant formula ( equation [ moments from cumulants ] , below ) , which expresses the moments of the considered elements in a very precise combinatorial way in terms of free cumulants .",
    "this allows us to reduce the multi - dimensional case essentially to the one - dimensional case .",
    "( note that this reduction is usually the hardest part in such inequalities . )",
    "whereas in some cases ( as for circular elements ) this reduction yields directly the desired result , in other cases  namely when the cumulants of the @xmath0-diagonal element may be negative ( as it happens for haar unitaries , i.e. , in the free group situation )  we need an additional step .",
    "our strategy is to replace the original @xmath0-diagonal element @xmath21 with a different @xmath0-diagonal element @xmath22 whose cumulants are positive and dominate the absolute values of the cumulants of @xmath21 ; this has to be done in such a way that we have control over both the @xmath14-norm and the operator norm of @xmath22 in terms of the corresponding norms of @xmath21 .",
    "the technique we develop will , we hope , have more general applicability .",
    "let us now give a precise definition of the arena for our haagerup inequality .",

    "this result was proved using a version of the haagerup inequality presented in @xcite .",
    "we should note that , although this result is for the free group factor , the @xmath8-particle spaces used in the proof are _ not _ the same as in theorem [ classical haagerup inequality ] , but are rather defined in terms of a generating family of _ semicircular elements _ defined in section [ section primer ] ; nevertheless , the relevant haagerup inequality _ can _ be proved from theorem [ classical haagerup inequality ] using a central limit approach similar to the one in @xcite .",
    "it is biane s free ultracontractivity theorem , along with our intuition that norm - inequalities improve in holomorphic categories , that motivated us to consider the same type of haagerup inequality for @xmath0-diagonal elements . in the special case of circular elements , the first author showed in @xcite that , as in the gaussian case , in the holomorphic category  in this case the spaces @xmath56  biane s hypercontractivity result is trumped by janson s strong hypercontractivity .",

    "there is a family of such spaces @xmath667 for @xmath668 ( with @xmath669 corresponding to the classical theory of gaussian random variables , and @xmath670 the hyperfinite @xmath671-factor ) , and biane introduced number operators @xmath672 affiliated to each of them .",
    "we should also note that , in @xcite , biane introduced a space isomorphic to @xmath57 , but did not consider the action of a number operator on it .",
    "the main theorem of @xcite shows as a special case ( the case @xmath673 ) that the semigroup @xmath46 affiliated with @xmath57 is not only a contraction semigroup on @xmath39 ( for tracial @xmath25 ) , but is in fact _ strongly hypercontractive _ :      this _ strong hypercontractivity _",

    "the main theorem of @xcite is the generalization of nelson s hypercontractivity theorem to the @xmath553-gaussian factors .      in the classical holomorphic case studied by janson ,",
    "while the semigroup @xmath46 is a contractive map from @xmath684 to @xmath685 for any @xmath674 , once @xmath50 is large enough it is also unbounded for @xmath686 . as a result ,",
    "the semigroup @xmath46 does not map @xmath684 into the algebra of bounded functions for any time .",
    "of course , in the classical context , the algebra of bounded functions contains no holomorphic functions save constants ; even in the full real spaces , the same effect holds .",
    "this is essentially due to the fact that the kernel of the semigroup @xmath46 in these cases , the _ mehler kernel _ , is not a bounded function .",
    "a semigroup is called _ ultracontractive _ if it maps @xmath14 into @xmath52 for all @xmath53 .",

    ", we may essentially follow biane s argument and prove a stronger form of proposition [ prop biane ultracontractivity ] not only for the algebra @xmath695 , but in fact for all @xmath26 with @xmath21 @xmath0-diagonal .",

    "this is similar in spirit to the stronger form of hypercontractivity @xcite which holds in the holomorphic version of nelson s setup in @xcite .",
    "we emphasize , again , that ultracontractivity is a _",
    "strictly _ non - commutative effect in this case , since the semigroup is unbounded from @xmath699 in the classical ( real and holomorphic ) contexts .",
    "theorem [ theorem strong ultracontractivity ] is thus an essentially non - commutative result which highlights the interesting phenomenon that many functional inequalities improve in the holomorphic category .",

    "the second factor is just @xmath705 .",
    "the first factor is the derivative of @xmath706 .",
    "the reader may readily verify that we thus have @xmath707 for all @xmath53 .",
    "this shows that @xmath697 .",
    "moreover , the function @xmath708 is decreasing on @xmath709 and has limit @xmath710 at @xmath711 .",
    "this proves equation [ strong ultracontractivity bound ] .",
    "it is typical to prove , from a bound like equation [ strong ultracontractivity bound ] , a sobolev inequality of the form @xmath712 for an appropriate @xmath713 ; indeed , if @xmath46 in theorem [ theorem strong ultracontractivity ] were a classical sub - markovian semigroup defined on @xmath14 of a radon measure , we could use the standard techniques in , for example , @xcite , to prove a strong sobolev imbedding theorem ( for _ any _ @xmath714 ) in this case .",
    "however , the techniques necessary to implement such a proof use the marcinkewicz interpolation theorem in a fundamental way . as pointed out in @xcite , holomorphic spaces like @xmath26 ( in particular in the case @xmath219 ) tend not to be complex interpolation scale ( at least in the @xmath715 case ) .",
    "thus , we are unable to prove a sobolev inequality for @xmath26 using known - techniques .",
