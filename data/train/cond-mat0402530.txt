    "it was recently shown @xcite that a general kato - bloch matrix expansion can be applied to weakly - coupled quantum chains .",
    "this algorithm was used to study weakly - coupled heisenberg chains @xcite .",
    "the dmrg was used as the method of solution for an isolated chain and then again for the solution of an effective 1d model which is obtained by projecting the problem to the basis of the tensor product of independent chain states . a good agreement with the stochastic series expansion ( sse )",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) was found for transverse couplings @xmath0 not too large .",
    "then interchain diagonal exchange @xmath1 which frustrates the system was introduced .",
    "it is found , by analyzing ground state energies and spin - spin correlation functions , that there is a transition between two ordered magnetic states . when @xmath2 , the ground state displays a nel order .",
    "when @xmath3 , a collinear magnetic ground state in which interchain spin correlations are ferromagnetic becomes stable . in the vicinity of the transition point , @xmath4 , the ground state is disordered .",
    "the prediction of a disordered ground state is of central importance for two reasons .",
    "first , because a recent neutron scattering experiment @xcite on the frustrated afm cs@xmath5cucl@xmath6 has predicted a spin liquid ground state in this material .",
    "second , a disordered doped spin liquid has been conjectured to be relevant for the physics of high temperature cuprate superconductors .",
    "the search of this disordered two - dimensional state by numerical methods has been challenging .",
    "cluster qmc methods @xcite , that have been extremely useful in nonfrustrated spin systems , are hampered by sign problems for hamiltonians with finite @xmath7 , making very difficult their study by this technique .",
    "new algorithms have been specifically designed to deal with frustration and intense numerical research has been devoted to these systems @xcite .",
    "it is thus of central importance to show that the dmrg prediction is correct .",
    "we address in this paper several questions that increase the understanding and show new potential of the method , giving additional support for the physical findings of ref . .",
    "some of these questions are technical in nature and they demand exhaustive comparison with exact results .",
    "the class of models that we study here have transverse terms involving competing interactions .",
    "these transverse terms are projected in a optimal reduced basis of eigenstates of the independent chain .",
    "if , for instance , the chains are coupled with perpendicular and diagonal exchange constants ( see the left ladder in fig . [ ed - latt ] ) , the projection of the perpendicular ( @xmath8 ) and the diagonal ( @xmath7 ) parts of the interchain coupling is qualitatively different one to the other .",
    "more precisely , to represent coupling terms along the diagonal requires matrix elements of operators defined in different sites ( those usually associated with the computation of short range correlation functions in 1d dmrg calculations ) .",
    "it is this competing behavior what generates negative local boltzmann weights ( sign problems ) that can not be eliminated by canonical transformations when qmc is used .",
    "therefore , it is important to check if all competing terms are represented and treated with similar accuracy by studying models that mix these terms in different ways .",
    "we will also show that the accuracy is directly correlated to the binding energy of the chains and not to the nominal values of the transverse couplings , concluding that the method is specially good for the study of frustrated systems . in addition , based on the results of this study we have designed internal tests that signal good performance of the method when dealing with larger lattices where comparison with exact data is not possible .    finally , we are also interested in showing the controlability of the approximation involved in the method , specifically for frustrated systems .",
    "we emphasize that its variational nature implies that the accuracy can be systematically improved by enlarging the number of states kept in the density matrix defined perpendicular to the chains(@xmath9 ) .",
    "this point is not a trivial one ; it demands an accurate projection of the transverse hamiltonian in an accurate representation of the hilbert space of the chains .",
    "the systematic comparison with exact diagonalization ( ed ) results in two- and three - legged ladders presented here shows that in q1d systems excellent results can be obtained with modest values for @xmath9 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the different models studied in this paper are presented in section [ models ] .",
    "then we summarize the main steps of the algorithm implementation in section [ method ] . in section [ ms1ms2 ]",
    "we show how to improve systematically the numerical results for several magnitudes exploiting the variational property of the method . in section [ frust ]",
    "we study the accuracy as we increase different exchange couplings in the transverse hamiltonians . in section [ conclusions ]",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "to discuss the issues that we presented in the introductory section we need to compare the results obtained with two - step dmrg with exact data , that can be achieved by ed in small lattices @xcite .",
    "in addition , we want to evaluate the performance of the method for a very general class of transverse hamiltonians including those that involve frustrating couplings between the chains ( i.e. , an exchange constant @xmath7 along the diagonal of the square lattice ) . it is also important to study systems with different numbers of legs because they behave in a very different way as they approach the thermodynamic limit @xcite .     and diagonal coupling @xmath7 . on the left the chains",
    "are arranged on a triangular lattice .",
    "[ ed - latt],width=226 ]    the natural choice as test models are then the heisenberg two- or three - legged ladders in the strong coupling limit : @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 represents the spin operator in the site @xmath13 of chain @xmath14 with the indices running @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we impose open boundary conditions in the two directions .",
    "the coupling @xmath7 connects spin operators along the diagonal and introduces frustration in the model .",
    "another frustrated model of great interest is the system of weakly coupled chains arranged in a anisotropic triangular lattice which can be written in the form @xmath17 where the new term @xmath18 is : @xmath19    note that the model in the square lattice with diagonal couplings ( [ square ] ) reduces to the model defined in the triangular lattice [ hmatl ] when one of the two diagonal couplings is set to zero .",
    "a detailed description of the two - step dmrg method , which we will refer for short 2s - dmrg , has been given in refs . and .",
    "the exact spectrum of a single af chain is known from the bethe ansatz , but eigenfunctions are not easily accessible .",
    "thus , the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method @xcite will be used to compute an approximate spectrum @xmath20 of a single chain . a preliminary account of this approach @xcite as well as an extensive comparison with the quantum monte carlo method was presented elsewhere @xcite . by expressing the hamiltonian on the basis generated by the tensor product of the states of different chains one obtains , up to the second order , the effective one - dimensional hamiltonian ,    @xmath21 } e_{\\parallel [ n ] }      j_{\\perp } \\sum_{l } { \\bf \\tilde{s}}_{l } { \\bf \\tilde{s}}_{l+1}+\\\\ j_{d } \\sum_{l } { \\bf \\tilde{s}}_{l}{\\bf \\tilde{s}}_{l+1 } + ... \\label{efhamil}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the composite chain - spin operators on the chain @xmath14 are @xmath22",

    "rotational invariant hamiltonian , is a very astringent probe of the reliability of the method .",
    "the interchain spin flip coupling terms ( e.g. @xmath31+h.c . ) connects different sectors with different total chain magnetization @xmath32 that have to be accurately and consistently described by the @xmath9 states outcoming from the block renormalization step that culminates the one - dimensional part of the algorithm .",
    "this is achieved by a careful targeting of states in sectors with increasing chain magnetization @xmath33 .",
    "we also computed the binding energy of the chains @xmath34 which is primarily a transverse magnitude .",

    "we have studied frustrated spin ladders using a recently proposed numerical renormalization group method for quasi - one - dimensional systems . we have presented exhaustive comparison with exact diagonalization data , a test that any other numerical method in strongly correlated systems have had to pass .",
    "the two - step dmrg method has shown good performance in a large class of frustrated systems reaching in some cases a precision comparable with the 1d case .",
    "we find a close correlation between the binding energy of the chains and the accuracy in the computation of ground state energy and the gap .",
