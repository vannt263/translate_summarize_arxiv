    ", it may be necessary to replace @xmath0 with @xmath19 in ( [ predii33 ] ) to avoid the non - existence of @xmath20 for certain values of @xmath0 .",
    "the form @xmath19 depends on the particular function @xmath21 and is defined for specific cases later .",
    "the definition of garma model allows to consider the adjust of exogenous variables @xmath22 however in this work the term @xmath23 will be considered as a constant @xmath24 . for count data time",
    "series we will consider the following distributions .",

    "the canonical link function for this model is the logarithmic function , so that the linear predictor is given by , @xmath33 where @xmath34 . the poisson garma model is defined by equations ( [ eqi ] ) and ( [ mediagarma1 ] ) .",
