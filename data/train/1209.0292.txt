    "since they constitute one of the broad classes of proposed physical realizations of quantum computing devices @xcite , coherently interacting light - matter systems have received lately a considerable level of attention .",
    "the interest has been further enhanced by relatively recent progress in a variety of systems ranging from polaritons in quantum wells @xcite to semiconductor quantum dots @xcite which nowadays make it possible to realize solid - state based quantum systems which couple to a single photon eigenmode of optical microcavities . at the same time",
    "the many - body effects in these systems are becoming increasingly important in the context of engineering of semiconductor lasers@xcite motivated by potentially a great enhancement in performance of designs in which quantum dots serve as an active medium @xcite .    while an ideal system of identical two - level ( spin 1/2 ) emitters coupled uniformly to a single light - mode is describable in terms of the dicke hamiltonian @xcite",
    ", a more realistic setup would need to include possible inhomogeneities in both the energy splitting of the individual spins and in their respective coupling strengths to the bosonic light mode . in previous studies",

    "j=1^n v_j ( b^ s_j^- + s_j^+b ) , [ dickehamvj ]    was performed by solving the schrdinger equation in the limit of small excitation numbers . since the total number of excitations @xmath1 is conserved , the dimension of the hilbert space involved in the unitary evolution of the system is drastically reduced .",
    "thus it became possible to solve the explicit time dependence of every quantum amplitude involved .    in this work",
    ", we revisit this problem by exploiting the quantum integrability of a certain generalized dicke model . using the algebraic bethe ansatz ( aba )",
    ", one can numerically compute exact eigenstates of the system and study its dynamics rendered trivial by the use of the proper eigenbasis .",
    "additionally , this approach allows , in the strong coupling regime , a drastic truncation of the hilbert space granting access to relatively large system sizes . on the other hand",
    ", integrability imposes the constraint that every spin - like subsystem be uniformly coupled to the bosonic mode and consequently , we study the specific hamiltonian h = b^b + _ j=1^n _ j s_j^z + v _ j=1^n ( b^ s_j^- + s_j^+b ) . [ dickeham ]",

    "as in ref .",
    "[ ] , this work focuses on the decay of a number of bosonic excitations due to the coupling of the mode to an initially unexcited set of two - level emitters .",
    "such a state could , in principle , be obtained by first preparing the spin system in its ground - state then exciting the bosonic mode via an external radiation pulse . for small number of excitations ,",
    "a crossover between two distinct regimes was found . at weak coupling",
    ", the bosonic occupation number @xmath4 undergoes an exponential decay and at strong enough coupling , the occupation undergoes non - decaying periodic oscillation with frequency which is enhanced by the dicke supperradiance effect .",
    "this is a dynamical counterpart of the hepp and lieb superradiance quantum phase transition.@xcite    starting from a large number of excitations , for weak coupling strength , the dimension of the necessary hilbert space severely limits the system sizes treatable using the aba .",
    "still , for very small systems , we do find rapidly decaying short - time dynamics as in the mean - field treatment . however , our capacity to make quantitative comparisons with the mean - field approach is hindered since its validity is necessarily limited to large systems .",
    "consequently , the bulk of our results focuses on the strong coupling regime , where heavy truncation of the hilbert space allows a nearly exact treatment of larger systems . in this case , for a small number of initial excitations , the spectrum obtained in the full quantum treatment is characterized by set of equally spaced frequencies , leading to nearly periodic real - time dynamics .",
    "the mean - field approach , which also leads to periodical oscillating bosonic populations , then reproduces the quantum dynamics up to some relatively long ehrenfest time at which both solutions start to differ significantly .",
    "when the number of initial excitations becomes of the order of the system size , the spectrum shows strong deviations from a harmonic progression no longer reproducing the periodic oscillations obtained in mean - field .",
    "nonetheless , we find that the mean - field approach remains valid for the very short - time dynamics of the system leading to a finite , but considerably shortened , ehrenfest time .",
    "the crossover to the regime of periodic oscillations occurs when the superradiantly enhanced coupling with the boson mode becomes larger than the bandwidth of the spin energy splittings .",
    "for example , this effect can manifest itself as a suppression of the inhomogeneous broadening in a system of self - assembled quantum dots in a zero dimensional cavity .",
    "a realistic high in - plane density of ingaas dots@xcite @xmath5 will enhance coupling of a single dot to a photonic crystal cavity,@xcite a micropillar,@xcite or a concave microcavity,@xcite which is ( @xmath6 @xmath7ev ) , by two to three orders of magnitude in the optical domain@xcite that is well inside or even above the range of natural bandwidths of ensembles of such dots@xcite ( @xmath8 mev ) .",
    "thus for sufficiently high densities a spectrally broadened ensemble of the self - assembled dots will exchange all of its excitations with a boson mode without a decay , at least on a finite time scale , in the same way as an ideal atomic system without any broadening , making it suitable to engineer a high power semiconductor laser .",
    "when such a system is in the strong coupling regime , the effect of quantum fluctuations could be observed in a direct time - resolved measurement at different excitation powers . at low to intermediate number of excitations",
    "the many rabi oscillations would be visible without any significant decay .",
    "however , when the number of excitations reaches @xmath9% of the number of spins , a strong decay on a time scale of a single period would appear due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "the dependence of this effect on the number of spins can be used to discriminate it from other sources of relaxation that occur at large probing powers such as charge or phonon fluctuations .",

    "section [ bethe ] describes the exact solution ( aba ) and the numerical techniques used to exploit it in order to compute the non - equilibrium dynamics we are interested in .",

    "are then compared and analyzed in section [ results ] where both the spectrums and the real - time dynamics are studied .",

    "therefore , while one can expect the periodicity of the semi - classical results to be adequately reproduced for small @xmath3 , the opposite regime will be characterized by a set of incommensurate frequencies ultimately leading to some decay .",

    "first , the quantum oscillation frequency is systematically shifted to higher frequencies and , at the same time , the amplitude is shown to decay . when the number of excitations is small enough the frequency shift is small and",

    "however , when @xmath18 and @xmath25 become comparable , the quantum dynamics exhibits a rapid amplitude decay which , not being captured by the mean - field analysis , leads to a drastic difference between both descriptions of the bosonic occupation . as evidenced by fig .",
    "[ fig : time_evolution ] , a larger difference in the oscillation frequency also occurs , making the distinction between both approaches even more important . nonetheless , even for @xmath123 the mean - field approach is shown to capture perfectly the initial instability and provides an accurate description up to some finite time .    in order to characterize the regime of validity of the mean - field approximation",

    "however , since this growth is extremely slow and therefore in stark contrast to the @xmath178 case , mesoscopic systems remain too small for the classical mean - field treatment to describe correctly the behavior past the initial stage of decay .",

    "for strong enough couplings , this method based on the algebraic bethe ansatz provides a simple truncation scheme , which allowed us to treat relatively large systems even for a strongly excited initial state .",
