    "the far - infrared ( far - ir ) luminosities of luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ; @xmath20 ) and ultra - lirgs ( ulirgs ; @xmath21 ) are dominated by reprocessed thermal dust emission , due to a combination of star - formation and agn activity , with star - formation typically being the more dominant component ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
