    "in a recent experiment , dinsmore and collaborators  @xcite measured the probability distribution of a single colloidal bead enclosed in a rigid , pear - shaped vesicle .",
    "they find that upon addition of much smaller spheres , density gradients give rise to an effective force field that pushes the particle towards the wall .",
    "these depletion forces have been discussed for almost fifty years  @xcite , especially since they can be used to organize self - assembled structures  @xcite .",
    "the remarkable feature observed in  @xcite is that entropic interactions drastically affect the distribution in a way that depends on the _ local shape _ of the membrane .",
    "indeed , it has been shown  @xcite that inhomogeneities in the curvature distribution induce additional forces that bring the particle to _ inwardly _ curved regions .",
    "the authors then suggested that if curvature induces forces on particles , the latter may in turn lead to shape transitions provided that the membrane is flexible enough  @xcite .    if this last statement is valid , it would be conceivable to take advantage of depletion forces to mimic biological processes such as protein integration , membrane fusion , or encapsulation .",
    "for instance , polyethylene glycol is a ( polymeric ) depleting agent known for its low toxicity : by changing its mass or concentration , one can selectively tune the range and the depth of the depletion potential without affecting any physiological parameter , i.e. , ph , temperature and ionic strengths . this remarkable versatility",
    "further justifies the growing interest in depletion interactions and makes them particularly suitable for applications such as gene transfection  @xcite .    in this article , we present a systematic study of entropic forces near a fluctuating interface .",
    "the additional degree of freedom associated with surface softness induces numerous antagonistic features that have to be carefully accounted for . besides the eventuality of shape transformation , a fluid membrane experiences thermal undulations whose amplitude is inversely proportional to its bending rigidity  @xcite .",
    "the steric forces between adjacent bilayers , originating from shape excitations , are invoked to explain the phase behavior of lamellar stacks of membranes  @xcite .",
    "similarly , a colloidal particle has first to overcome a repulsive barrier prior to adhering to a fluctuating membrane .",
    "this point is usually ignored in discussions concerning colloidal adsorption , even though it may deeply affect the kinetics of the binding process .",
    "a more refined consequence is the effect of membrane fluctuations on the concentration profile of small particles , which in turn affects the depletion potential .",
    "it is the aim of this work to theoretically address these different issues .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] , we give a brief outlook of some general results regarding effective , entropic interactions .",
    "the balance between depletion and bending forces is studied in section  [ sec3 ] , where we derive a tentative phase diagram of the system .",
    "we present in section  [ sec4 ] our findings concerning the corrections to the depletion potential .",
    "we conclude this report with a discussion and summary of our results in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "we consider a binary mixture of small and large spherical beads with radius @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively . in a single - component description , the large particles",

    "note that in eq .",
    "( [ depletion ] ) , the thermodynamic quantities have to be evaluated _ before _ insertion of the large particle .",
    "this assertion happens to be essential since the symmetries of the relevant functions are solely determined by the geometry of the system .",
    "for instance in the presence of a planar wall at @xmath9 , the density profiles depend on the @xmath10-coordinate only , whereas translational symmetry in the @xmath11-plane is broken after particle insertion .",
    "( [ depletion ] ) provides a low - density expansion for the depletion potential even if the interactions between the species are soft and possibly contains attractive contributions .",
    "it also encompasses the hard - sphere limit considered in the original theory of asakura and oosawa  @xcite , for which the mayer function reduces to @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is the usual heaviside step function that equals @xmath14 for @xmath15 and @xmath16 otherwise . in the presence of a planar wall ,",
    "the volume fraction of depleting particles @xmath17 is also expressed in terms of the step function , namely @xmath18 . the convolution eq .",
    "( [ depletion ] ) is then a measure of the overlap volume  see fig .  1 .",
    "for a separation @xmath19 between the surface of the large sphere and the wall , the depletion potential reads  @xcite @xmath20 for @xmath21 , and @xmath22 otherwise .",
    "the value at contact is @xmath23 , where we introduce the aspect ratio @xmath24 . for typical volume fraction @xmath25 and aspect ratio @xmath26",
    ", the depth of the potential well is @xmath27 .",
    "thus , these entropic effects can not be ignored as they may eventually overcome the direct interactions . actually , they appear to be essential in describing phase separation and aggregation phenomena in polydisperse mixtures  @xcite .",
    "while much of the theoretical and numerical effort assumes that the small particles are structureless spheres , experimental studies mainly use polymers as depleting agents . actually , the formal mapping of a polymer solution onto a fluid of `` soft '' particles is a challenging problem because of intricate many - body interactions  @xcite . for most of practical purposes however",

    "note that this assertion is still valid above the overlap concentration , provided that one substitutes @xmath28 with the correlation length of the solution  @xcite .",
    "in the recent years , a variety of experimental techniques have been developed to probe soft materials at the sub - micrometer scale : optical tweezers , surface force apparatus ( sfa ) , atomic force microscopy ( afm ) , or total internal reflection microscopy ( tirm ) .",
    "these progress have enabled direct comparison with theoretical predictions , and numerous experimental works have confirmed the validity of eq .",

    "the kinetics is also ignored throughout the treatment  @xcite .     around the large spheres and along the surface ( delimited by the doted lines ) .",
    "when these depletion volumes overlap ( grey regions ) , the osmotic pressure of the gas of small particles becomes anisotropic and the large particle is pushed toward the surface . the effective volume available for the small particles",
    "is further increased if the surface can deform and envelop the large particle . ]",
    "the adsorption of colloidal particles on a soft surface is an essential step in many biological processes .",
    "the underlying physics of this mechanism has been extensively studied for simple model systems  @xcite . here",

    "we specify the interface profile through the displacement field @xmath31 , where @xmath32 spans the horizontal reference plane at @xmath9 , and define the fourier representation @xmath33 .",
    "the statistical behavior of the surface can be studied within a continuum model based on the following hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath34 with @xmath35 the bending rigidity and @xmath36 the surface tension .",
    "the elastic coefficient @xmath37 is related to the curvature of an eventual external potential ( gravitational field , effective `` mean - field '' intermembrane interactions ) .",
    "this model allows us to describe a wide class of surfaces , ranging from liquid - liquid or liquid - gas interfaces , with high surface tension and vanishing bending modulus , to pure fluid membranes with finite bending modulus and zero surface tension . the intermediate combination where both @xmath36 and @xmath35 are finite would for instance correspond to a surfactant monolayer at the oil / water interface  @xcite .    a flexible surface as described by the hamiltonian @xmath38 is not a simple planar surface , but i ) can be deformed under an external constraint , and ii ) presents an intrinsic roughness due to thermal fluctuations",
    ". in this section ,",
    "we derive the phase diagram for the different wrapping states of the colloid . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the bending regime @xmath39 . the critical behavior of the system results from a balance between the driving depletion force and the membrane bending energy .",
    "the former separates into an entropic and an enthalpic contribution , that we study separately .",
    "a colloidal particle feels in the vicinity of the membrane a steric repulsion resulting from the thermal undulations  @xcite .",
    "an analytical expression for this repulsion is known only for a membrane close to an infinite , flat wall : the free energy at given mean separation @xmath19 scales as @xmath40 , with @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "one way to make contact with the curved geometry is to use the derjaguin approximation  @xcite , which relates the force between a sphere and a plane to the potential between two planes . in the limit @xmath42 ,",
    "the force exerted by the fluctuating surface on the spherical particle is @xmath43 . here",
    ", @xmath19 is the distance between the surface of the particle and the average position of the membrane .",
    "it follows that the effective potential between a sphere and a membrane equals @xmath44 . for @xmath45 ,",
    "the total potential @xmath46 is @xmath47 with @xmath48 , whereas only the repulsive part survives at separations @xmath49 .",
    "minimizing @xmath50 gives the position of the minimum @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , the requirement that @xmath52 corresponds to a _ global _ minimum defines a critical bending modulus @xmath53 below this critical value , there is no bound state and the particle can never reach the surface . in the adhesive regime @xmath54 ,",
    "the particle localizes at the minimum @xmath52 of the potential that equals @xmath55 for @xmath56 and @xmath25 .",
    "one could argue that the superposition of the helfrich repulsion and the direct potential in an attempt to produce an effective potential is in general not correct  @xcite .",
    "rather , a virial expansion of the direct part is needed to describe the thermodynamics of the system  @xcite . here however , both the attractive and repulsive parts of the potential are entropic in nature , thus possibly justifying such a superposition .",
    "we now assume that once the repulsive barrier is overcome , the colloidal particle is adsorbed on a purely elastic sheet . as shown on fig .  1 , the depletion contribution to the free energy",
    "is further decreased if the membrane envelops the particle .",
    "note that we assume here that the solvent on both sides of the surface is incompressible : the only volume contribution comes from the variation of the overlap volume .",
    "the natural parameter that describes the wrapping transition is the degree of penetration @xmath57 defined as the ratio between the covered area and the total area of the colloid .",
    "the equilibrium value of @xmath57 is set by the balance between osmotic and bending forces . neglecting the fluctuations ,",
    "the free energy contributions divides into three parts .",
    "the first term is the bending energy of the covered area that simply equals @xmath58 . in the limit of a small aspect ratio ,",
    "the overlap volume is @xmath59 , so that the depletion - induced adsorption can be described in terms of a constant adhesion energy per unit area @xmath60  @xcite .",
    "this approximation is certainly not valid in the early stages of the wrapping process where @xmath61 , but remember that we are interested by the limit @xmath62 .",
    "the last contribution arises from the free part of the membrane and is more difficult to evaluate , since it generally requires one to solve the full non - linear shape equations  @xcite .",
    "fortunately the problem greatly simplifies for a membrane with no surface tension , providing that there is no pressure difference between both sides of the surface . in this particular case ,",
    "no forces are applied to the free part of the membrane .",
    "the deformation profile becomes a catenoid , a surface with zero curvature and consequently a _ vanishing bending energy_. the free energy of the system is then a linear function of @xmath57 @xmath63 eq .",
    "( [ energybend ] ) then defines a second critical bending rigidity @xmath64 the colloidal bead is in the unwrapped state above @xmath65 , whereas the membrane completely encapsulates the particle below this critical value  @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the minimum of the free energy is not an extremum , but corresponds to either boundaries of the domain @xmath66 or 1 .",
    "therefore , the equilibrium profile does not have to satisfy the usual stationarity requirement @xmath67 , with @xmath68 the mean curvature at the detachment point  @xcite .",
    "the conditions eq .  ( [ critbend1 ] ) and ( [ critbend2 ] ) enable us to draw the phase diagram of the system presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . for low bending rigidity or volume fraction ,",
    "the colloid is always in the unbound state because of the helfrich repulsion .",
    "also , the membrane can not wrap the particle if the bending modulus is too high .",
    "conversely , the membrane envelops the colloid when the bending modulus lies within the range @xmath69 . for typical values @xmath26 and @xmath25 the boundaries correspond to @xmath70 and @xmath71 . depending on the volume fraction and the aspect ratio of the small colloids",
    ", this interval can actually vanish : the condition of existence of a wrapped state is given by the inequality @xmath72    arguably , the heuristic derivation presented here is not accurate enough to predict the nature of the transitions and the exact values of the numerical constants .",
    "the influence of finite - size effects on the unbinding transition would in particular deserve a further analysis in the future .",
    "however , this phenomenological description provides some important insights for the understanding of the wrapping transition .",
    "we derived in the preceding section the phase diagram for the wrapping of a colloidal particle .",
    "in particular , we found that encapsulation can indeed be driven by depletion forces .",
    "however , we have not yet addressed another relevant question arising from the surface softness , namely the effect of thermal undulations on the depletion potential itself . as explained in section ii",
    ", the derivation of this potential only involves the density profile of the small components .",
    "here we adopt a procedure in a sense opposite to the original route pursued by asakura and oosawa , and construct the equilibrium concentration profile for a _",
    "solution , instead of spherical beads , near a fluctuating surface .",
    "we then apply this result to evaluate the effective depletion potential .",

    "we make three major hypothesis : i ) the particles are ideal polymer chains , ii ) we treat only the very dilute case where the polymers act independently , and iii ) we assume that surface undulations are only a perturbation to the planar configuration . even within this restrictive set of assumptions , we find the following remarkable results . in the first regime @xmath154 , the polymers are closely bound to the surface by an effective , attractive potential .",
    "this primarily results from the tendency of the chains to fill the holes or valleys on a rough surface , and can be understood as follows : close to a wall , the colloidal solution is affected over a characteristic length fixed by the size @xmath0 of the particles .",

    "this is not the case in the regime where @xmath165 . here , the statistical weight of the undulations with curvature at their minima smaller than @xmath166 grows rapidly , followed by an increase of @xmath167 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    in the range @xmath168 , the chains are on the contrary repelled more from the fluctuating surface than from a flat wall .",
    "this unusual behavior reflects a broadening of the interface : as the polymer coils move away from the average elevation @xmath9 , they `` feel '' an effective layer of thickness @xmath74 from which they are excluded .",
