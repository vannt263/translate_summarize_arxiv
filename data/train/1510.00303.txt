    "let @xmath352 and @xmath353 denote the numbers of mature and immature population of a single species at time @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "we will study the system @xmath354 where @xmath355 and the nonnegative kernel @xmath5 can be asymmetric . note that by scaling the variables , we can suppose that @xmath328 .",
    "now , observe that in the system ( [ sy3 ] ) the first equation can be solved independently of the second . in this way , if the system ( [ sy3 ] ) admits a semi - wavefront solution @xmath356 with speed @xmath27 , then @xmath331 must satisfy the immature equation @xmath357 where the operator @xmath358 is defined by @xmath359 if @xmath51 is bounded , we get that @xmath315 can be represented by @xmath360 where @xmath361 and @xmath362 are the roots of @xmath363 . in addition , @xmath364 and @xmath365 .",
    "now , if @xmath28 , then we have @xmath366 , and in consequence , the lebesgue s theorem of dominated convergence implies that @xmath316 .",
    "thus we obtain the following lemma .",
    "the second equation of the system ( [ sy3 ] ) has a semi - wavefront @xmath367 with @xmath316 when @xmath330 is a semi - wavefront of the first equation of the system ( [ sy3 ] ) .    finally , consider the characteristic functions @xmath75 and @xmath368 associated with the mature equation of system ( [ sy3 ] ) and @xmath369 defined in section [ into ] .",
    "then the following theorem is a direct consequence of theorem [ 2 ] .    [ un ]",
    "let assumptions * @xmath272 * -*@xmath31 * hold . if @xmath33 and @xmath349 , then the system ( [ sy3 ] ) admits at least one semi - wavefront solution @xmath356 for each admissible wave speed @xmath0 . if @xmath351 , then the existence holds for each @xmath145 .",
    "furthermore , the system ( [ sy3 ] ) has no semi - wavefront solution propagating with speed @xmath320 .",
    "we note that theorem [ un ] completes or improves some results of @xcite , where the non - existence or the uniqueness was established under assumptions that @xmath5 is gaussian or symmetric kernel , and @xmath16 monotone . in @xcite only the particular cases @xmath370 and @xmath371 , were studied , and in @xcite , the assumptions were either @xmath372 or @xmath373 .",
