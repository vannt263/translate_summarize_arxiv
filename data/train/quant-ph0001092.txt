    "models described by one - dimensional schrdinger equations with quasi - periodic potentials display interesting spectra : this kind of potential is intermediate between periodic ones , leading to energy bands and extended states , and truly random potentials , which cause localisation @xcite .",
    "a super - lattice e.g. may be made of two species of doped semiconductors producing a one - dimensional chain of quantum wells . a qualitative model to describe the corresponding wave - functions is given by the tight - binding model , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 represents the effect of quantum well  @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is a positive parameter playing the role of a coupling constant @xcite .",
    "an interesting description results when this super - lattice is constructed by means of a deterministic rule .",
    "the simplest rule obtains when the two species alternate in a periodic way .",
    "but in general the rule will be aperiodic .",
    "one widely studied example is the fibonacci sequence , which is quasi - periodic @xcite : given two ` letters ' @xmath5 and @xmath6 , one substitutes @xmath7 and @xmath8 . iterating this rule on @xmath5 one thus generates the sequence @xmath9 , in which the frequency of @xmath5 s is given by the golden mean @xmath10 .",
    "other examples of such substitution rules are the thue - morse sequence ( non quasi - periodic ) , which is obtained through the substitution @xmath11 giving @xmath12 , and the period - doubling sequence ( non quasi - periodic ) , @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "accordingly , a piece - wise constant potential @xmath14 based on such such a rule , e.g. @xmath15 , is called a ` substitution potential ' .",
    "the potential of the fibonacci sequence has one - dimensional quasi - crystalline properties .    in recent years problems of quantum computing  ( qc ) and information processing",
    "have received increasing attention . to solve certain classes of problems in a potentially very powerful way ,",
    "one tries to utilize in  qc the quantum - mechanical superposition principle and the ( non - classical ) entanglement . in the models of qc based on quantum turing machines  ( qtm ) @xcite ,",
    "the computation is characterized by sequences of unitary transformations ( i.e. by the corresponding hamiltonians  @xmath16 acting during finite time interval steps ) .",
    "benioff has studied the tight - binding model in a generalized qtm @xcite , where qc is associated with different potentials at different steps as an ` environmental effect ' .",
    "these kinds of influences may introduce _ deterministic disorder _ which would degrade performance by causing reflections at various steps and decay of the transmitted component @xcite .    here",
    "we investigate an iterative map on qubits which can be interpreted as a qtm architecture @xcite : local transformations of the turing head controlled by a sequence of rotation angles @xmath17 ( parameter inputs ) alternate with a quantum - controlled not - operation  ( qcnot ) with a second spin on the turing tape .",
    "those angles at steps @xmath18 are reminiscent of the potentials @xmath19 introduced before . in the present paper",
    "we will investigate the fibonacci rule and the thue - morse case mainly with respect to the local dynamics of the turing head , which will be shown to reflect the degree of ` randomness ' of the substitution sequences .",
    "the various types of aperiodic structures have been characterized up to now by the nature of their fourier spectra only @xcite .",
    "the quantum network @xcite to be considered here is composed of two pseudo - spins @xmath20 ( turing - head @xmath21 , turing - tape spin @xmath22 , see figure  [ qtm_chaos ] ) so that its network state @xmath23 lives in the four - dimensional hilbert space spanned by the product wave - functions @xmath24 . correspondingly , any ( unitary ) network operator can be expanded as a sum of product operators .",
    "the latter may be based on the @xmath25-generators , the pauli matrices @xmath26 , together with the unit operator @xmath27 .",
    "the initial state @xmath28 will be taken to be a product of the turing - head and tape wave - functions .",
    "for the discretized dynamical description of the qtm we identify the unitary operators @xmath29 ( step number ) with the local unitary transformation on the turing head @xmath21 , @xmath30 , and the qcnot on ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 , respectively , as follows : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a ( local ) projection operator , and the turing head is externally driven by substitution sequences @xmath35 specified by @xmath36 . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the quasi - periodic fibonacci - ( qf ) and thue - morse sequence ( tm ) , respectively : & & _",
    "1^ = _ 1 , _ 2^ = _ 2 , _ 3^ = _ 1 , _ 4^ = _ 1 , _ 5^ = _ 2 , [ fibo ] + & & _ 1^ = _ 1 , _ 2^ = _ 2 , _ 3^ = _ 2 , _ 4^ = _ 1 , _ 5^ = _ 2 , .[tm ]    first , we consider the reduced state - space dynamics of the head  @xmath21 and tape - spin  @xmath22 , respectively , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the total network state at step @xmath3 , and @xmath39 are the respective bloch - vectors . due to the entanglement between the head and tape , both will , in general , appear to be in a ` mixed - state ' , which means that the length of the bloch - vectors in ( [ bloch ] ) is less than @xmath22 .",
    "however , for specific initial states @xmath40 the state of head and tape will remain pure : as @xmath41 are the eigenstates of @xmath42 with latexmath:[$\\hat{\\sigma}_{1}^{(1 ) }     @xmath32 of equation  ( [ ub ] ) can not create any entanglement , irrespective of the head state @xmath44 , i.e. latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{entangle } \\hat{u}^{(s,1)}\\,|\\varphi\\rangle\\!^{(s ) } \\otimes\\,|+\\rangle\\!^{(1)}\\,&=&\\ ,    \\hat{u}^{(s,1)}\\,|\\varphi\\rangle\\!^{(s ) } \\otimes\\,|-\\rangle\\!^{(1)}\\,&=&\\ , \\hat{\\sigma}_{3}^{(s ) }     a consequence , the state  @xmath38 remains a product state for any step  @xmath3 and initial product state @xmath46 & |_n^= |_n^^(s ) |^(1 ) , ( _ 2^(s)(n|))^2 + ( _ 3^(s)(n|))^2 = 1 .",
    "&    here @xmath47 denotes the bloch - vector of the turing head @xmath21 conditioned by the initial state @xmath48 . from the fibonacci sequence ( [ fibo ] ) and the property ( [ entangle ] ) it is found for @xmath49 , and @xmath50 that @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where the cumulative rotation angle is & _",
    "2m(+ ) = = _ 1 m + ( _ 2 - _ 1 ) m,&with @xmath53 being the total number of angles @xmath54 up to step @xmath55 .",
    "for the cumulative rotation angle @xmath56 up to step @xmath3 we utilize the following recursion relations & _ 2m(- ) = -_2m-1(-),_2m-1(- ) = _",
    "m^ + _ 2m-2(-).&then it is easy to verify that for @xmath57 and @xmath50 [ cumulative ] | _ n(- ) | 2 ( |_1| , |_2| ) = : m , yielding @xmath58 .    from any initial state ,",
    "@xmath59 , @xmath60 this trajectory of the turing - head  @xmath21 represents a non - orthogonal pure - state decomposition . by using ( [ plus_fibo ] ) , ( [ cumulative ] ) , ( [ super ] ) @xmath61 we finally get for @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 or @xmath66 .",
    "thus the expression  ( [ chaotic_driving ] ) indicates that for the local dynamics of the turing head in the ` non - classical ' regime the cumulative control loss due to any small perturbation @xmath67 of the given @xmath68 grows at most linearly with @xmath3 , so that all periodic orbits on the plane @xmath69 are stable ( see figure  [ stability]@xmath5 - @xmath70 ) , as in the case of the ` regular ' control @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "this may be contrasted with the chaotic fibonacci - rule ( cf ) , @xmath72 ( lyapunov exponent : @xmath73 ) , which can be interpreted as a temporal random ( chaotic ) analogue to one - dimensional chaotic potentials @xcite : each step @xmath74 is controlled by the cumulative information of the two previous steps .",
    "for a small perturbation of the initial phase angle @xmath75 the cumulative angles @xmath76 , respectively , grow exponentially with @xmath77 , and so do the deviation terms @xmath78 from the periodic orbits ( po ) .",
    "thus the total cumulative control loss induced by the perturbation can show chaotic quantum behaviour on the turing head @xcite .    for the thue - morse control ( [ tm ] )",
    "we easily find that for @xmath62 and @xmath79 & _ n(+ ) = 2 ( _ 1 + _ 2 ) m,_n(- ) = 0,&respectively , which is very similar to the result of the ` regular ' machine with @xmath80 , implying @xmath81 and @xmath82 . in all cases",
    "considered we thus find characteristic local invariants with respect to the turing head ( figure  [ stability]@xmath83 ) .",
    "the distance between density operators , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , defined by the so - called bures metric @xcite & d_^2 : = \\ { ( - )^2}.&lies , independent of the dimension of the liouville space , between 0 and 2 . for pure states we can rewrite & & d^2 = 2(1 - |||^2 ) = 2 ( 1 - o ) + & & o : = |_0()| ^ ( ) ( 0 ) |_0(0 ) |^2,where the perturbed unitary evolution , @xmath86 , connects the initial state , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .",
    "this metric can be applied likewise to the total - network - state space or any subspace . in any case",
    "it is a convenient additional means to characterize various qtms : for the regular case , @xmath89 ( lyapunov exponent @xmath90 ) , and any initial perturbation @xmath67 for @xmath85 the distance remains almost constant @xcite ; for the chaotic fibonacci rule ( cf ) , on the other hand , @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the cumulative perturbation of the angle @xmath93 at step @xmath94 we obtain an initial exponential sensitivity @xcite . in the case of the present substitution sequences we observe for a small perturbation of the given @xmath36 no initial exponential sensitivity in the evolution of @xmath95 , which confirms that any periodic orbit is stable ( figure  [ evolve]@xmath5 ) .",
    "finally we display the evolution of @xmath95 for the total network state @xmath38 , which also shows no exponential sensitivity ( figure  [ evolve]@xmath6 , cf . figure  3@xmath70 in @xcite ) .",
    "the respective distances for tape - spin @xmath22 are similar to those shown .",
    "the corresponding behaviour under the thue - morse control is qualitatively the same .",
    "this parameter - sensitivity @xcite has been proposed as a measure to distinguish quantum chaos from regular quantum dynamics . from the results of the present analysis and those in @xcite satisfying this criterion",
    "we conclude that , indeed , only classical chaotic input makes the quantum dynamics in qtm architectures chaotic , too ( figure  [ qtm_chaos ] ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the quantum dynamics of a small qtm driven by substitution sequences based on a decoherence - free hamiltonian . as quantum features we utilized the superposition principle and the physics of entanglement .",
    "quantum dynamics manifests itself in the superposition and entanglement of a pair of ` classical ' ( i.e. disentangled ) state - sequences .",
    "the generalized qtm under this kind of control connects two fields of much recent interest , quantum computation and motion in one - dimensional structures with ` deterministically aperiodic ' potential distributions .",
    "no chaotic quantum dynamics results in this case , as shown by the lack of exponential parameter - sensitivity .",
    "local invariants leading to one - dimensional point manifolds ( patterns ) exist for @xmath96 only . for @xmath97 a continuous destruction of these patterns sets in ( figure  [ stability]@xmath6 ; hardly visible yet in figure  [ stability]@xmath5 ) .",
    "this reminds us of the disappearing of kam tori in the classical phase space resulting from a small perturbation ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "patterns in reduced bloch - planes @xmath98 ( a quantum version of a poincar - cut ) should thus be similarly useful to characterize quantum dynamics in a broad class of quantum networks . due to the entanglement , we can see regular , chaotic , and intermediate quantum dynamics , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the parameter sensitivity gives a sensitive criterion for testing induced quantum chaos in a pure quantum regime .",
    "this might be contrasted with the usual quantum chaology , which is concerned essentially only with semiclassical spectrum analysis of classically chaotic systems ( e.g. level spacing , spectral rigidity ) @xcite .",
    "it is expected that a qtm architecture with a larger number of pseudo - spins on the turing tape would still exhibit the same type of dynamical behaviour under the corresponding driving conditions .",
