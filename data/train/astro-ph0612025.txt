    "abrupt variation in the stratification of a star ( relative to the scale of the inverse radial wavenumber of a seismic mode of oscillation ) , such as that resulting from the ( smooth , albeit acoustically relatively abrupt ) depression in the first adiabatic exponent @xmath0 caused by the ionization of helium , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are pressure , density and specific entropy , or from the sharp transition from radiative to convective heat transport at the base of the convection zone , induces small - amplitude oscillatory components ( with respect to frequency ) in the spacing of the cyclic eigenfrequencies @xmath4 of seismic oscillation .",
    "one might hope that the variation of the sound speed induced by helium ionization might enable one to determine from the low - degree eigenfrequencies a measure that is directly related to , perhaps even almost proportional to , the helium abundance , with little contamination from other properties of the structure of the star .",
    "a convenient and easily evaluated measure of the oscillatory component is the second multiplet - frequency difference with respect to order @xmath5 amongst modes of like degree @xmath6 :    @xmath7    ( gough , 1990 ) .",
    "any localized region of rapid variation of either the sound speed or the density scale height , or a spatial derivative of them , which here we call an acoustic glitch , induces an oscillatory component in @xmath8 with a ` cyclic frequency ' approximately equal to twice the acoustic depth    @xmath9    of the glitch , and with an amplitude which depends on the amplitude of the glitch and which decays with @xmath10 once the inverse radial wavenumber of the mode becomes comparable with or greater than the radial extent of the glitch .",
    "we report here on a model formula for the oscillatory contribution to the second frequency difference that is directly related to the gross properties of the glitch , and compare how well it fits actual eigenfrequency differences with corresponding fits of previously published formulae .",
    "for a nonrotating star with vanishing pressure gradient at the surface , the angular eigenfrequencies @xmath11 of adiabatic oscillation obey a variational principle ( e.g. chandrasekhar 1963 ) which can be used to estimate the contribution @xmath12 to @xmath11 from the acoustic glitch . in estimating the contribution from helium ionization we retain only the dominant glitch term ( @xmath13 at fixed pressure and temperature ) ,",
    "and we represent @xmath13 by a pair of ( negative ) gaussian functions of @xmath14 with widths @xmath15 and @xmath16 , whose integrals are @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and which are centred about the acoustic depths @xmath19 and @xmath20 of the first and second ionization zones of helium beneath the seismic surface @xmath21 of the star . after converting to cyclic frequency @xmath22 , the oscillatory component is given asymptotically by    @xmath23\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\bigl(\\mu\\beta\\kappa_{\\rm i}^{-1 }   { \\rm e}^{-8\\pi^2\\mu^2\\kappa^2_{\\rm i}\\delta_{\\rm ii}^2\\nu^2}\\cos2\\psi_{\\rm i}\\nonumber\\\\ & & { } \\;\\;\\;+\\kappa_{\\rm ii}^{-1}{\\rm e}^{-8\\pi^2\\kappa^2_{\\rm ii}\\delta_{\\rm ii}^2\\nu^2}\\cos2\\psi_{\\rm ii}\\bigr)\\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    ( houdek & gough , 2007 ) .",
    "we evaluate the phases @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , by representing the envelope by a plane - parallel polytrope of index @xmath273.5 and adding a phase constant @xmath28 to @xmath29 to account for the deviation of the actual envelope from the polytrope : @xmath30 in equation  ( 3 ) , @xmath31 etc , with @xmath32^{1/2}$ ] ; also @xmath33 is a characteristic value of the first frequency difference @xmath34 whose value is half the inverse total acoustic radius @xmath35 of the star : @xmath36 .",
    "we have found that the ratios @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 hardly vary amongst stellar models whose masses and radii vary by factors of at least five .",
    "we have accordingly adopted constant values , namely @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 for solar - like stars .    to obtain a complete description of @xmath8",
    "we must add an oscillatory contribution from the near discontinuity in the density scale height at the base @xmath43 of the convection zone :    @xmath44 \\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath45 ^{r_{\\rm c}{+}}_{r_{\\rm c}{-}}\\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath46 is the polytropic phase at the base of the convection zone , the phase constant @xmath47 being allowed to differ from @xmath28 to account for the fact that the region of the convection zone beneath the helium ionization zones is not an exact polytrope ; the quantity @xmath48 is a characteristic scale over which the sound speed in the radiative interior relaxes to a smooth extrapolation from the convection zone ( and which we also take to be constant , 80s , for all the stars we consider ) .    from these expressions it is straightforward to evaluate the second difference @xmath8 , to which must be added a smooth term which we represent by a third - degree polynomial in @xmath49 :    @xmath50    the eleven parameters @xmath51 are adjusted to fit by least squares the theoretical curve to the second frequency differences of the actual eigenfrequencies of the modes .",
    "we compare the current seismic diagnostic  ( 3)(7 ) with diagnostics published previously by monteiro & thompson ( 1998 , 2005 ) and by basu etal .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "this diagnostic is based on a single - triangular approximation to @xmath13 due to he ionization .",
    "the resulting formula for the frequency perturbation is @xmath52^{1/2 } \\;\\cos(4\\pi\\nu\\tau_{\\rm c}+2\\epsilon_{c})\\ , , \\ ] ] in which @xmath53 is the half - width and @xmath54 is proportional to the height of the triangle , from which second differences can be computed .",
    "we set to zero the fitting parameter @xmath55 , a nonzero value of which , in the original formulation , would account for an putative adiabatic extension to the convection zone produced by overshooting ( which is not present in our solar models ) . by so doing , the seismic diagnostic ( 8) has the same number , 11 , of fitting parameters as the seismic diagnostic  ( 3)(7 ) when adopting the third - degree polynomial ( 7 ) to represent the smooth contribution .      in this formulation the seismic diagnostic",
    "is that used by basu ( 1997 ) , which was invented by basu , antia and narasimha ( 1994 ) for studying the base of the convection zone .",
    "ballot et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and piau et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have adopted essentially the same formula .",
    "it is not directly linked to the form of the ionization - induced acoustic glitch , but instead was motivated by the oscillatory signature of a discontinuity in sound speed , whose amplitude was modified to make it decay with frequency approximately in the manner of the second differences of the eigenfrequencies .",
    "the functional form is given by @xmath56 here we set @xmath57 , to remove the effect of the erroneous sound - speed discontinuity at the base of the convection zone and to render the functional form of the contribution at @xmath58 ( nearly ) consistent with those in the other two signatures ( 5 ) and ( 8) ; and we adopt the third - degree polynomial ( 7 ) to represent the smooth contribution , thereby using the same number ( 11 ) of fitting parameters as the seismic diagnostics  ( 3)(7 ) and ( 8) , ( 7 ) .",
    "two sets of calibrated evolutionary models of the sun , computed by gough and novotny ( 1990 ) , were used .",
    "one set of models has a constant value for the heavy - element abundance @xmath59 but with age varying in uniform steps of approximately 0.051 in @xmath60 , and the other set has constant age but varying heavy - element abundance in uniform steps of approximately 0.016 in @xmath61 ( see fig .  1 ) .     but varying age ; the second set of the models , ( 5)(8 ) , have constant age but varying @xmath59 .",
    "all three diagnostics were fitted by the same numerical algorithm .",
    "the lower panels of figs  24 show the results for the three seismic diagnostics  ( 3)(7 ) , ( 8) and ( 7 ) , and ( 9 ) and ( 7 ) , fitted by least - squares to the adiabatically computed eigenfrequencies of the nine test models . plotted are the frequency - averaged amplitudes , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , of the two oscillatory seismic contributions associated with  ionization and with the base of the convection zone , obtained by averaging the appropriate calibrated formula uniformly over the frequency range of the data plotted in the upper panels . also plotted are the values for the acoustic depths @xmath20 and @xmath43 .",
    "depending on the seismic diagnostic , the values of either @xmath16 , @xmath53 or the phase constant @xmath28 are shown , and also the standard measure @xmath64 of the goodness of the fit between @xmath8 of the modelled frequencies and the calibrated seismic diagnostic . in all three cases the frequency - averaged amplitude @xmath62 increases with the helium abundance @xmath65 of the test models",
    "; moreover , the amplitudes @xmath66 and @xmath54 inferred from diagnostics  ( 3)(7 ) and ( 8) , ( 7 ) respectively also increase with @xmath65 ( @xmath66 varying almost linearly in the @xmath59-varying sequence , @xmath54 varying almost linearly in the @xmath67-varying sequence ) , the latter result being apparently at variance with the findings of monteiro and thompson ( 2005 ) . the seismic diagnostic  ( 3)(7 ) fits @xmath8 of the model eigenfrequencies the best , as is evinced by its smallest values of @xmath64 .",
    "the quality of the fits is also illustrated in the upper panels of figs  24 , which show the second frequency differences over the whole frequency range considered for the central model 0 .",
    "it is also clear from comparing these figures that the seismic diagnostic  ( 3)(7 ) reproduces @xmath8 of the model frequencies the most faithfully .",
    "it is interesting to note that in determining the parameters in the formulae the fitting procedure gives greater weight to the low - frequency end of the ionization - induced component @xmath68 , where the amplitude is the greatest , and greater weight to the high - frequency end of the contribution @xmath69 from the base of the convection zone , where misfits can not be offset by adjustments to @xmath68 ; therefore , the diagnostics ( 8) , ( 7 ) and ( 9 ) , ( 7 ) fail principally in the mid - range .",
    "some large - scale discrepancy can be seen also at high frequency for formula ( 9 ) , ( 7 ) because @xmath68 decays with frequency too slowly .",
    "we acknowledge that these discrepancies might be either smaller or hardly greater than the random errors in imminent asteroseismic data ; nevertheless , fitting an erroneous formula can lead to the inferences from that fitting being biased , and should therefore be avoided .",
