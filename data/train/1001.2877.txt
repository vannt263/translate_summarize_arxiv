    "we remedy this complication by showing that the original proposals  @xcite can be recovered simply by applying a potential field bias .",
    "we proceed first by establishing the second - quantized hamiltonian description for the array of quantum dots and then showing how the hamiltonian can be simplified to a first - quantized hamiltonian over ddot charge qubits . in the slow tunneling - rate regime , we show that the first - quantized hamiltonian is well approximated by the ubiquitous ising - like hamiltonian .",
    "this hamiltonian considerably simplifies the dynamical description and shows that the necessary bias of the ddot charge qubits to generate cluster states is determined by the number of ddot neighbors .",
    "thus a global bias of a large structure will lead to periodic evolution of excellent approximations to cluster states .",
    "furthermore , by applying different biases only to the ddots on the boundary ( and not to the ddots within ) , the hamiltonian induces evolution to the ideal cluster state .",
    "our aim here is to remedy the deficiency of anisotropies in the evolution of ddot charge - qubits .",
    "we show that this problem can be nearly remedied by a global field bias and completely remedied by a global field bias with corrective biases applied to the ddots at the boundary .",
