    "observations of young stellar populations in the galaxy have revealed that the majority of stars form in clusters @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite performed an extensive near - infrared imaging survey of the central regions of l1630 in orion b and found that about 60 @xmath10 90 % of all the young stellar populations associated with the molecular cloud form only in three rich embedded clusters . using the 2mass point source catalog , @xcite estimated the fraction of young stellar populations contained in clusters to be 50 @xmath10 100 % for nearby cluster forming molecular clouds such as perseus , orion a , orion b , and monr2 .",
    "recent near - infrared surveys of young stellar populations using the spitzer space telescope have confirmed that clustered star formation is the dominant mode of star formation in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "however , previous studies of star formation have focused on star formation in relative isolation , for which the environmental effects that play a crucial role in clustered star formation are thought to be minor or at least secondary .",
    "thus , how stars form in the cluster environment remains only poorly understood .",
    "an important clue to understanding star formation in clusters has come from recent millimeter and submillimeter observations of the nearby cluster - forming region , the @xmath4 ophiuchi molecular cloud ( l1688 ) , which uncovered dense cores with a mass spectrum that resembles the salpeter imf @xcite .",
    "similar studies in other star forming regions have confirmed that such a resemblance between the core mass spectrum and the stellar imf seems to be common in nearby star forming regions @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that the stellar imf may be determined to a large extent by the core mass distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although mass accretion from ambient gas onto forming stars may sometimes plays an important role in determining the final masses of stars @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to investigate the formation and evolution of dense cores in the cluster environment .",
    "recent theoretical studies on core formation in the cluster environment have emphasized the role of supersonic turbulence @xcite .",
    "these studies have demonstrated that dense cores are formed in regions compressed by converging turbulent flows .",
    "however , the origin of this supersonic turbulence and its role in core formation are still a matter of debate .",
    "two main scenarios have been proposed . in the first scenario ,",
    "formation of dense cores ( and thus star formation ) is considered to be completed only in one turbulent crossing time , i.e. , one dynamical time , so that the cluster forming regions are destroyed within one dynamical time @xcite . in this case , the mass spectrum of dense cores is shaped by the cascade of primordial interstellar turbulence that has a power law form @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the second scenario , star formation is considered to continue at least over several dynamical times . in this case , additional turbulent motions must be replenished to keep supersonic turbulence in molecular clouds because supersonic turbulence dissipates quickly in one dynamical time @xcite . in such circumstances ,",
    "dense cores are continuously created ( and destroyed ) in molecular gas disturbed strongly by the additional turbulent motions . in the cluster environment ,",
    "stellar feedback such as stellar winds , hii regions , and protostellar outflows has been discussed as the dominant source of additional supersonic turbulence @xcite .",
    "other sources of turbulence such as supernova blastwaves , external cloud shearing , or converging flows of cloud formation may also play a role ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as for the protostellar outflow - driven turbulence , @xcite identified the characteristic energy injection scale at @xmath11 0.05 pc for the l1551 star forming region where a group of stars are forming , indicating that the protostellar outflows are the primary source of regenerating turbulence in this region .",
    "recently , @xcite performed three - dimensional ( 3d ) hydrodynamic simulations of turbulent molecular clouds and suggested that the physical properties of dense cores may be affected directly by the presence or absence of turbulent feedback , although further justification may be needed .",
    "therefore , to shed light on the issue of core formation in the cluster environment , it is essential to investigate the kinematics of dense cores . in this paper",
    ", we thus analyze the physical properties of dense cores in the nearest cluster forming region , the @xmath4 ophiuchi molecular cloud .",
    "the @xmath4 ophiuchi molecular cloud is the nearest cluster forming regions at a distance of @xmath12 pc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dense part of the @xmath4 ophiuchi molecular cloud ( hereafter the @xmath4 ophiuchi main cloud ) is known to harbor a rich cluster of young stellar objects ( ysos ) in different evolutionary stages @xcite .",
    "recent millimeter and submillimeter dust continuum observations of the @xmath4 ophiuchi main cloud have revealed that a large number of dense cores are concentrated in the central dense part of the cloud and their mass spectra are similar in shape to the stellar imf @xcite . by comparing with isothermal , pressure - confined , self - gravitating bonnor - ebert spheres",
    ", @xcite argued that the dense cores detected by the dust continuum emission are likely to be self - gravitating and expected to form stars ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , to accurately assess the dynamical states of the dense cores , it is necessary to perform molecular line observations using high density tracers such as h@xmath0co@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) and n@xmath5h@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , both of which have the critical densities for excitation as high as @xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "recently , the nobeyama observatory has released the archive data of the h@xmath0co@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) line emission toward the @xmath4 ophiuchi main cloud taken with the 45 m radio telescope . at a distance of 125 pc , the spatial resolution of the data of 21  , corresponding to @xmath3 pc , is comparable to those of the dust continuum observations , e.g. , the scuba at the jcmt with a beam size 14at 850 @xmath15 m .",
    "thus , the nobeyama archive data is suitable for analyzing the dynamics of small scale structures comparable to the ones detected by the dust continuum observations .",
    "our analysis is complementary to that of @xcite who observed several subclumps ( oph a , b1 , b2 , c , e , and f ) with the iram 30 m radio telescope using n@xmath5h@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) line to measure the line widths of the dust cores detected by @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath0co@xmath1 data of the nobeyama 45 m telescope was taken in a larger area covering the whole dense region of the @xmath4 ophiuchi main cloud , including all the subclumps observed by @xcite .",
    "since the dense gas detected by molecular line emissions such as h@xmath0co@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) and n@xmath5h@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) may not be always well associated with the dust cores and therefore the line widths of the dust cores estimated by @xcite may not be accurate , we identified the dense cores directly from the molecular line data cube and estimated their physical quantities such as the core radius , mass , and line width .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , the description of the archive data is presented in ",
    "[ sec : data ] . in ",
    "[ sec : global ] we show the spatial distribution of the dense gas detected by the h@xmath0co@xmath1 emission , which indicates very clumpy structures .",
    "then , in  [ sec : core ] we identify the clumpy structures as dense cores applying a clump - finding algorithm , the so - called clumpfind @xcite , and derive the physical properties of the identified cores . to accurately evaluate the core masses , the fractional abundances of h@xmath0co@xmath1 relative to h@xmath5 are derived directly by comparing the h@xmath0co@xmath1 column densities with the h@xmath5 column densities obtained from the 850 @xmath15 m dust continuum emission . in  [ sec : discussion ] we discuss the mass spectrum of the identified cores and their dynamical states .",
    "we also compare the physical properties of the identified cores with those in orion a , taking into account the effect of different distances ( or different spatial resolutions ) . finally , we summarize our main conclusion in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we used the archive data of the @xmath4 ophiuchi main cloud taken in h@xmath0co@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) molecular line ( 86.75433 ghz ) with the nobeyama 45 m radio telescope .",
    "the fits data is available from the web page of the nobeyama radio observatory at the national astronomical observatory of japan ( ` http://www.nro.nao.ac.jp/ ` ) .",
    "the observations were carried out in the period from 2002 march to 2003 may .",
    "all spectra were obtained in the position - switching mode .",
    "the data has @xmath16 grid points in the @xmath17-@xmath18-@xmath19 space , covering the whole dense region of the @xmath4 ophiuchi main cloud with size of about @xmath20 pc @xmath21 pc .",
    "the grid size of the data was 21  , corresponding to 0.013 pc at a distance of 125 pc .",
    "the main beam efficiency of the telescope was 0.51 .",
    "we note that the fwhm beam size of the telescope was 18  at 87 ghz , and therefore the data were almost full - beam sampled , considering the typical pointing error of a few arcsecond ( see the web page of the nobeyama radio observatory ) .",
    "the velocity resolution is 0.13 km s@xmath8 and the average root mean square ( rms ) noise determined from signal - free channels is @xmath22 0.11 k in @xmath23 .",
    "here , we present the overall distribution of dense gas observed by the h@xmath0co@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) emission .",
    "figure [ fig : global]a shows a total integrated intensity map of the h@xmath0co@xmath1 emission toward the @xmath4 ophiuchi main cloud . for comparison , the 850 @xmath15 m image obtained with the scuba at the jcmt is shown in figure [ fig : global]b .",
    "while the distribution of the h@xmath0co@xmath1 emission appears to cover a larger area than that of the 850 @xmath15 m emission , the overall spatial distribution of the h@xmath0co@xmath1 emission is similar to that of the 850 @xmath15 m emission .",
    "we note that it is very difficult to observe extended structures with bolometers mounted on ground - based telescope due to the atmospheric emission .",
    "the extended structures larger than @xmath24 1.5 ( @xmath25 pc ) are therefore suppressed in removing the atmospheric emission during the data reduction process , making the 850 @xmath15 m map mostly devoid of extended emission @xcite .",
    "our h@xmath0co@xmath1 map shows that the well - known dense subclumps ( oph a , b1 , b2 , c , e , and f. note that the oph d region is out of our area . ) , previously identified by dco@xmath1 and other observations , are very clumpy as recent submillimeter observations have revealed @xcite . in the next section ,",
    "we identify the clumpy structures as dense cores applying a clump - finding algorithm , clumpfind @xcite , and derive physical properties of the identified cores .",
    "blow - up total integrated intensity maps toward the oph a and oph b1 , b2 and c regions are shown in figures [ fig : ophabd]a and [ fig : ophabd]b , respectively .",
    "iso antenna temperature surfaces of the same areas in the 3d data space ( @xmath17-@xmath18-@xmath19 ) are also shown in figure [ fig : ophabd3d ] .",
    "our intensity maps can be compared with figure 2 of @xcite , the n@xmath5h@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) intensity maps obtained with the iram 30 m telescope .",
    "the beam sizes for both the telescopes are comparable : the hpbw of the iram 30 m , 26.4  , is about 1.5 times as large as that of the nobeyama 45 m telescope , 18  . both the molecules are also expected to trace dense molecular gas in nearly the same density range because the critical densities for excitation of h@xmath0co@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) and n@xmath5h@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) lines are comparable ( @xmath26 @xmath14 and @xmath27 @xmath14 ) .",
    "in fact , the distribution of the h@xmath0co@xmath1 emission is remarkably similar to that of the n@xmath5h@xmath1 emission .",
    "the most intense line emission of h@xmath0co@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) comes from the oph a region .",
    "the maximum antenna temperature reaches @xmath28 k at the position that coincides with that of a starless object , sm1 , identified by @xcite within our spatial resolution .",
    "a prominent feature of this region is a dense ridge running from north to south , which is also seen in the 850 @xmath15 m map .",
    "the starless objects sm1 , sm1n , and sm2 identified by @xcite are located just at the densest part of the ridge .",
    "although relatively strong h@xmath0co@xmath1 emission is detected toward vla1623 , the prototypical class 0 object , it is difficult to distinguish the h@xmath0co@xmath1 emission associated with vla 1623 from the ambient component because of our resolution as large as 21  .    in the 850 @xmath15 m map ,",
    "@xcite found two filaments in the oph a region [ see figure 1 of @xcite ] .",
    "similar structures can be recognized in our h@xmath0co@xmath1 map . in the 850 @xmath15 m map , the two filaments ( the dashed lines in figure [ fig : ophabd]a ) intersect at the position ( ra , dec ) = @xmath29 . in the h@xmath0co@xmath1 map , the north - east filament",
    "is not seen , whereas the north - west filament , a part of the oph a ridge , has strong h@xmath0co@xmath1 emission .",
    "such a feature is consistent with that of the n@xmath5h@xmath1 map by @xcite , indicating that the north - east filament presumably consist of diffuse warm gas .",
    "the filament is reminiscent of the orion bar where the dust continuum emission enhanced by heating from pdrs and young stars is prominent but the h@xmath0co@xmath1 line emission is not seen @xcite . in fact , the location of the north - east filament agrees well with the edge of the pdr seen in iso images @xcite .    in the western side of the oph a ridge ,",
    "@xcite found another interesting structure : two arcs that are labeled with no . 1 and 2 in figures [ fig : ophabd]a and [ fig : ophabd3d]a .",
    "in addition to these two , we identified 3 new arcs in the oph a region ( labeled with no . 3 through 5 ) .",
    "although the no .",
    "1 arc is not clearly recognized as an arc in the total intensity map of figure [ fig : ophabd]a owing to the presence of the extended diffuse component , the no .",
    "1 arc as well as the no . 2 and 3 can be clearly seen in the iso - temperature surfaces in figure [ fig : ophabd3d]a .",
    "these arcs may be created by the stellar wind from the young b3 star s1 .",
    "another possibility is the effect of three outflows detected in this region whose outflow axes are almost parallel in the @xmath17-@xmath18 space and inclination angles are around 60 @xmath10 80 degrees @xcite .",
    "one of the three outflows is the most spectacular outflow from the class 0 object vla 1623 .",
    "both sides of the no . 1 arc extended from vla 1623 , where no h@xmath0co@xmath1 emission is detected ,",
    "appear to be parts of a cavity created by the vla 1623 outflow .",
    "on the other hand , in the eastern side of the oph a ridge , we can recognize two new arcs .",
    "these arcs ( labeled with no . 4 and 5 )",
    "appear to be related to a giant protostellar outflow that has been recently discovered by nakamura et al .",
    "( 2009 , in preparation ) on the basis of the @xmath30co ( @xmath31 ) observations .",
    "a couple of features that are likely to be created by protostellar outflows are also seen in the oph b2 region , the densest region after the oph a. the h@xmath0co@xmath1 map shows a very clumpy structure with @xmath24 10 local peaks in the region .",
    "many dust cores identified by @xcite are distributed mainly in the bright area of the h@xmath0co@xmath1 map , where some cores identified by the clumpfind in the data cube ( see  [ sec : core ] ) are overlapped on the plane of the sky .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish such an overlapped core from the other in the h@xmath0co@xmath1 total integrated intensity map or the dust continuum map that does not have velocity information . in the southern part of the oph b2 region ( labeled with no .",
    "1 ) , a hole is seen in both the h@xmath0co@xmath1 and 850 @xmath15 m maps .",
    "the hole is particularly clear in the data cube in figure [ fig : ophabd3d]b .",
    "two other holes are also seen near the northern ( no . 2 ) and southern ( no . 3 ) edges of the b2 region .",
    "these holes are likely to be created by the giant protostellar outflow recently found by nakamura et al .",
    "the blue lobe of this outflow is extended beyond the b2 region , reaching the no . 4 and 5 arcs .",
    "the apparent luminosity and the total mass of this outflow are largest in @xmath4 oph .",
    "the driving source is likely to be a class i yso elias 32 or 33 .",
    "1 and 2 holes are likely to be created by the red and blue lobes , respectively .",
    "the interaction between the protostellar outflows and the dense gas will be discussed elsewhere ( nakamura et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) .",
    "cavities that could be created by protostellar outflows are also found in ngc1333 , a nearby cluster forming clump in the perseus molecular cloud @xcite , suggesting that density structures in cluster forming regions are strongly affected by protostellar outflows .",
    "nakamura et al . ( 2009 ) also found other examples of the dynamical interaction between the dense gas and the outflows in @xmath4 oph , which will be shown elsewhere .",
    "we identified 68 h@xmath0co@xmath1 cores in the @xmath4 ophiuchi main cloud , using the clumpfind method described in ",
    "[ subsec : identification ] . here",
    ", we describe physical properties of the identified cores .",
    "the definitions of the physical quantities of the cores are presented in  [ subsec : derivation ] .",
    "the fractional abundance of h@xmath0co@xmath1 relative to h@xmath5 , which is important to the determination of core mass , is estimated in  [ subsec : abundance ] . in  [ subsec : distribution ] , we describe the statistical properties of the physical quantities of the identified cores , and compare their positions with those of ysos identified by the spitzer space telescope mid - infrared data @xcite .",
    "we also compare our cores with 850 @xmath15 m cores listed in table 7 of @xcite .",
    "finally , we show in  [ subsec : correlation ] the correlation among physical quantities such as the line width - radius and virial ratio - mass relations .",
    "to identify dense cores from the h@xmath0co@xmath32 data cube , we applied the clumpfind method described in  3.2 of @xcite . in brief , we adopted the threshold ( @xmath33 ) and stepsize ( @xmath34 ) of the 2 @xmath35 noise level for core identification , following @xcite who recommended using this set of the parameters based on the results of their test simulations . to identify the cores with reasonable accuracy , we imposed the following 3 criteria : ( 1 ) a core must contain two or more continuous velocity channels , each of which has at least 3 pixels whose intensities are above the 3@xmath35 noise level , and ( 2 ) the pixels must be connected to one another in both the space and velocity domains . ( 3 ) furthermore , we rejected core candidates located at the edge of the observed region .",
    "the total intensity of the minimum mass core identified by this method has about 60 @xmath35 levels . using our definition of core mass ( eq.[[eq : mlte ] ] )",
    ", a minimum core mass is estimated to be 0.28 m@xmath36 and 0.38 m@xmath36 for @xmath37 k and 18 k , respectively .",
    "the total mass of the identified 68 cores is estimated to be 228 @xmath9 , 60 % of the total mass detected above the @xmath38 level .    in general , the physical properties of the identified cores",
    "depend on the core identification scheme and its parameters . in our case",
    ", we expect that our clumpfind can detect the real 3d density structures in the cloud from the h@xmath0co@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) spectral line position - position - velocity data cube because of the following reasons . according to @xcite ,",
    "the physical properties of the cores identified by clumpfind are affected siginificantly by the adopted threshold and stepsize unless they are carefully chosen .",
    "they recommend using the 2 @xmath35 noise level for both the threshold and stepsize , for which the clumpfind could detect and accurately measure the individual core properties in their test simulations .",
    "we adopt this set of the parameters in our clumpfind . recently , several authors revisted this problem @xcite .",
    "@xcite reexamined the effect of varying the values of the threshold ( @xmath393 , 5 , and 7 @xmath35 ) and stepsize ( @xmath40 ) for the core identification , and confirmed that the physical quantities of the identified cores depend on these parameters especially when the distribution of the emission is not localized in the data cube and the larger values of the parameters are used [ see also @xcite for the case of the low - spatial resolution ( @xmath411 pc ) , optically thick @xmath30co ( @xmath2 ) data with @xmath42 3 @xmath35 ] .",
    "@xcite explored more reasonable parameter ranges of @xmath44 and @xmath45 suitable for their core study in the omc-1 region , and demonstrated that the power - law index of a core mass spectrum does not depend on the threshold and stepsize .",
    "@xcite also discussed the `` overlap '' effect for which multiple cores that almost overlap along the line - of - sight are not separately identified by the clumpfind when they have nearly the same line - of - sight velocities .",
    "this overlap effect is likely to be significant when the gas is highly turbulent and the emission tends to be distributed in the large volume of the 3d data cube @xcite . for example , @xcite performed 3d mhd turblent simulations and claimed that the emission lines are often singly peaked even in the presence of multiple condensations along the line of sight .",
    "we note that their model clouds are highly turbulent , gravitationally unbound and the condensations have extremely large virial ratios , ranging from 10 to @xmath46 .",
    "this suggests that the overlap effect may be crucial for less dense gravitationally unbound molecular gas components observed by @xmath30co and @xmath0co ( see * ? ? ? * for the case of the polaris molecular cloud , a nearby diffuse , gravitationally unbound molecular cloud . ) .",
    "in contrast , for our h@xmath0co@xmath1 data , the overlap effect is expected to be minor because the h@xmath0co@xmath1 emission can trace only dense gas with densities greater than @xmath47 @xmath14 and appears to be reasonably localized in the 3d data cube , indicating that the dense gas is likely to have a small volume filling factor in the cloud and moderately quiescent ( the mach number @xmath48 ) .",
    "note that the low density gas has the mach number of about 5 @xmath10 6 @xcite .",
    "in fact , our cores have virial ratios of about 2 , as shown in ",
    "[ subsub : yso ] .",
    "thus , we expect that the clumpfind can identify the 3d density structures reasonably well from our h@xmath0co@xmath1 data .",
    "a caveat of our analysis is that the cores identified by the above procedure ( and any other core identification schemes ) are resolution dependent in the sense that the substructures smaller than the telescope beam size can not be resolved .",
    "it remains unclear whether an identified core is a unit that is separated dynamically from the background media .",
    "however , we expect that the structures identified from high density tracers such as h@xmath0co@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , n@xmath5h@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , and dust continuum data correspond to the real dense structures in the cloud as long as the spatial resolution is less than @xmath24 0.01 pc , because recent numerical simulations of pc - scale cluster forming clumps demonstrated that the dense structures like filaments often created in the clump have sizes of order 0.1 pc or less along the minor axes and densities of order @xmath13 @xmath14 @xcite",
    ". therefore , in the following , we discuss the statistical properties of the cores identified by the above procedure , assuming that the identified cores can be regarded as units that are reasonably separated dynamically from the background media . further investigation of this problem should be done when higher spatial resolution observations are available .",
    "we derive physical properties of the cores using the definitions described in  3.3 of @xcite . in brief , the position and local standard of rest ( lsr ) velocity of each core are determined at the pixel with the largest antenna temperature , @xmath49 , within the core . the core radius , @xmath50 ,",
    "is determined by taking the projected area enclosed by the 2 @xmath35 level contour and computing the radius of the circle required to reproduce the area , taking into account the correction for the telescope beam ( 18  ) .",

    ", @xmath166 is the average density and @xmath167 is the average velocity dispersion including both the thermal and turbulent components as @xmath168 , where @xmath169 and @xmath170 are the velocity dispersion of the nonthermal component and the isothermal sound speed , respectively .",
    "the average density and velocity dispersion were evaluated as @xmath171 @xmath14 and @xmath172 km s@xmath8 , respectively . the average surface pressure is then given by @xmath173 k @xmath14 .",
    "this value is about a few times as large as the thermal pressure [ @xmath174 @xmath175 k @xmath176 k @xmath14 ] . in the following ,",
    "we adopt the above @xmath178 as a representative value for our cores .",
    "this surface pressure is about a half the average internal pressure inside the cores ( @xmath179 k @xmath14 ) and close to the lower limit of the critical ambient pressure for the dust cores obtained by @xcite .    on the other hand , there is only one reliable measurement of the magnetic field strength toward the @xmath4 ophiuchi main cloud .",
    "@xcite performed oh zeeman effect measurements toward two positions in @xmath4 oph with a beam size 18. for one of the two positions that well covers the entire observed area of our data , they derived the line - of - sight magnetic field strength of about 10 @xmath15 g at the low density cloud envelope of @xmath180 @xmath14 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "based on this measurement , @xcite estimated the magnetic flux normalized to the critical value to be @xmath181 .",
    "if we adopt this value as a representative value of @xmath182 for our cores , the magnetic effect is likely to be minor : it reduces the gravitational energy term only by 16% .",
    "however , recent turbulent simulations have demonstrated that cores formed out of turbulent clouds can have much larger values of @xmath182 than the cloud initial values ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and thus it is very difficult to assess the values of @xmath182 for the individual cores without direct measurements of the magnetic fields associated with the cores . in the following ,",
    "we simply assume @xmath183 .",
    "the equilibrium line , @xmath184 , is shown by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : virial ] , where the surface term ( @xmath159 ) is plotted against the gravitational energy term ( @xmath158 ) , both normalized to the internal energy term ( @xmath157 ) . for the cores that lie below the solid line ,",
    "the value of @xmath185 is negative and thus expected to be bound .",
    "all the others are unbound and expected to disperse away , if they do not gain more mass through accretion and/or merging with other cores , or reduce internal support through turbulence dissipation .",
    "more than a half the cores lie below the equilibrium line , and are thus bound : they are expected to collapse and form stars .",
    "this is also true even in the presence of magnetic field as long as the magnetic flux does not exceed about a half the critical value .",
    "furthermore , the majority of the cores lie below the line of @xmath186 ( dashed line ) , indicating that the surface term is more important than the gravitational energy term . even for the cores lying above the line @xmath186",
    ", the surface pressure appears to be dynamically important for almost all such cores because the deviation from the line is small .",
    "we note that this plot should be valid statistically , but for any individual points the true surface pressures could be higher or lower than the representative surface pressure .",
    "our virial analysis indicates that the formation and evolution of dense cores in the cluster environment are likely to be strongly influenced by the external compression due to local turbulent motions ( see also dobashi et al .",
    "2001 for importance of external pressures at cloud scales ) .",
    "such local compression may be responsible for the formation of binary and multiple stars or formation of substellar objects ( brown dwarfs or planetary mass objects ) in each core under the cluster environment @xcite .",
    "the orion a molecular cloud is the nearest giant molecular cloud located at a distance of 480 pc @xcite , about 4 times as distant as the @xmath4 ophiuchi main cloud .",
    "recently , @xcite carried out the h@xmath0co@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) core survey in the whole region of orion a using the nobeyama 45 m telescope and identified 236 cores by the same method as adopted in the present paper .",
    "their core sample is ideal for comparison with our cores because the same molecular emission line , the same telescope , and the same core identification procedure are used . in this subsection",
    ", we compare the physical properties of our cores in @xmath4 oph with those in orion a.    figures [ fig : orion1 ] and [ fig : orion3 ] compare the physical properties of the @xmath4 oph cores with those of the orion a cores .",
    "the open squares and crosses indicate the @xmath4 oph cores and the orion a cores , respectively .",
    "the mean radius of the @xmath4 oph cores , 0.045 pc , is about three times smaller than that of the orion a cores , 0.14 pc .",
    "this probably reflects the different spatial resolutions ( or different distances ) for both the observations .",
    "in fact , the area where the @xmath4 oph cores are distributed is well separated from that of the orion a cores on the plots of the line width - radius and mass - radius relations ( see figure [ fig : orion1 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the mean mass of the @xmath4 oph cores , 3.35 @xmath9 , is only about 3.6 times smaller than that of the orion a cores , 12 @xmath9 .",
    "this is because the mean density of the orion a cores , @xmath187 @xmath14 , is much smaller than that of the @xmath4 oph cores , @xmath115 @xmath14 . in particular ,",
    "the mean density of the orion a cores is smaller than the critical density of the h@xmath0co@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , @xmath188 @xmath14 , and therefore the orion a cores are likely to contain substructures that could not be spatially resolved .",
    "the mean line width of the @xmath4 oph cores , 0.488 km s@xmath8 , is almost the same as that of the orion a cores , 0.52 km s@xmath8 , in spite of the different core radii .",
    "the ranges of the line widths are also similar to each other ( see figure [ fig : orion1 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the virial ratio of the orion a cores seems three times larger than that of the @xmath4 oph cores for a given lte mass , as shown in figure [ fig : orion3 ] .",
    "this difference may be explained also by the different spatial resolutions as follows .",
    "the virial ratio is proportional to both the radius and the square of the line width for a given lte mass .",
    "since the line widths of both the cores are comparable to each other and the radii of the orion a cores are roughly three times larger than those of the @xmath4 oph cores , the virial ratio of orion a becomes three times larger than that of @xmath4 oph for a given lte mass .    to elucidate whether or not the different spatial resolutions dominate the different core properties in the two clouds , we try to eliminate the effect of the different spatial resolutions as follows .",
    "we smoothed the original @xmath4 oph data on a coarser grid with a grid spacing of 80 `` by convolving with a 2d gaussian kernel with a fwhm of 80 '' in the @xmath17-@xmath18 space .",
    "the smoothed data correspond to the data that would be observed by the nobeyama 45 m telescope if the @xmath4 ophiuchi main cloud were located at the same distance as the orion a molecular cloud .",
    "then , applying the clumpfind to the smoothed data , we reidentified 16 dense cores , which are plotted by the filled circles in figures [ fig : orion1 ] and [ fig : orion3 ] . in figures [ fig : orion1]a and [ fig : orion1]b , the @xmath4 oph cores identified from the smoothed data are located just in the areas where the orion a cores are distributed .",
    "in contrast , the virial ratios of the reidentified @xmath4 oph cores are somewhat smaller than those of orion a for a given lte mass ( see figure [ fig : orion3]a ) . the larger virial ratios for the orion a cores may reflect the larger @xmath54 adopted by @xcite , @xmath189 , which is derived using the @xmath0co abundance measured in the cloud envelope of taurus , which has much lower column densities than orion a. if we use the @xmath0co abundance obtained by @xcite for @xmath4 oph , which has column densities comparable to the region observed by @xcite , the h@xmath0co@xmath1 abundance is reduced by a factor of 2 , close to our value .",
    "note that our value is in agreement with that of @xcite within uncertainty mentioned by them . using our value of @xmath54 ,",
    "the distribution of the orion a cores in the virial ratio - lte mass plot becomes consistent with that of the @xmath4 oph cores identified from the smoothed data , as presented in figure [ fig : orion3]b .",
    "although in that case , the lte masses of the orion a cores shift upward in figure [ fig : orion1]b , the distributions of the @xmath4 oph and orion a cores in the lte mass - radius relation plot are still well overlapped with each other . therefore , we conclude that there are no clear differences in the core properties between the @xmath4 oph and orion a clouds .",
    "the apparent differences in the core properties between the two clouds are likely to be caused mainly by the different spatial resolutions .",
    "figure [ fig : orion1 ] shows that there are no highly turbulent cores having @xmath120 km s@xmath8 in @xmath4 oph . according to @xcite ,",
    "all the highly turbulent cores in orion a are located within 1 pc from the m42 hii region and are probably influenced greatly by the nearby ob stars .",
    "the turbulent cores are expected to be responsible for massive star formation ( see the discussion of  4.3 of * ? ? ?",
    "the absence of such highly turbulent cores in @xmath4 oph may imply that massive o stars will not form in @xmath4 oph under the current environment .",
    "it is also interesting that the range of the line widths of the @xmath4 oph cores identified from the smoothed data almost coincide with that of the original @xmath4 oph cores .",
    "if we fit a single power - law to both the @xmath4 oph cores identified from the original and smoothed data , the best - fit result becomes @xmath190 with a very small correlation coefficient of 0.137 , which is shown by the solid line in figure [ fig : orion1 ] .",
    "in other words , the line width appears to be almost independent of the core radius .",
    "since the cores identified from the smoothed data contain adjacent several cores identified from the original data , the nearly independent relationship between the line width and core radius , or the nearly flat line width - radius relation , suggests that the inter - core motions among the neighboring cores are almost comparable to the internal motions in the individual cores .",
    "such a feature is pointed out by @xcite who measured the velocity difference among the neighboring cores from the centroid velocities of the cores observed by n@xmath5h@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) . if the line width - radius relation is flat ( @xmath191 const . ) and the core mass is proportional to @xmath192 , then the virial ratio is scaled as @xmath193 , a similar power - law to that derived by @xcite .",
    "this again suggests the importance of ambient turbulent pressure in dynamics of the cores as discussed in ",
    "[ subsec : virial analysis ] .",
    "the line width - radius relation of the @xmath4 oph cores appears to be inconsistent with one of the most reliable measurements of the line width - size relation , recently obtained by @xcite , who found a strong correlation between the line width and size based on the @xmath30co observations toward 27 nearby giant molecular clouds , despite the large differences in cloud environments and local star formation activity .",
    "their relation , plotted by the dashed line in figure [ fig : orion1 ] [ @xmath194 , leads to the interpretation that most of the turbulent energy comes from the largest scale that is comparable to the cloud size ( see the appendix ) .",
    "@xcite claimed that the driving mechanisms of turbulence at small scales such as protostellar outflows and stellar winds may not play an important role in dynamics of molecular clouds .",
    "the fwhm line width ( @xmath195 km s@xmath8 ) and radius ( @xmath196 pc ) measured from the @xmath0co ( @xmath2 ) line toward the whole @xmath4 ophiuchi main cloud are in good agreement with the heyer & brunt relation .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath4 oph cores identified from the original data tend to deviate upwards from the heyer & brunt relation",
    ". the nearly flat line width - radius relation of the @xmath4 oph cores may also suggest that turbulent energy has been injected at the scales smaller than @xmath197 pc , at which our best - fit power - law intersects with the heyer & brunt relation .",
    "this scale is in reasonable agreement with the characteristic length scale of the outflow - driven turbulence estimated from the theoretical consideration @xcite .",
    "based on @xmath0co and c@xmath100o observations , @xcite derived a similar characteristic scale of the outflow - driven turbulence of @xmath198 pc toward l1551 .",
    "however , the universality of the heyer & brunt relation implies that the outflow - driven turbulence may be limited to the localized dense regions where active star formation occurs .",
    "a caveat is that it is unclear whether the heyer & brunt relation , based on the @xmath30co observations , is still applicable to dense gas where stars are forming .",
    "therefore , the deviation of the line widths for @xmath4 oph from the heyer - brunt relation may be apparent .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the nearly flat line width - radius relation is consistent with the virial ratio - mass relation of the pressure - confined , self - gravitating cores ( @xmath199 )",
    ". this may suggest that the characteristic length scale of 0.35 pc is related to the formation of dense self - gravitating structures . in any case , if such a small scale driving of turbulence is common in the cluster environment , star formation in clusters is likely to continue over several dynamical times .",
    "on the other hand , the line widths of our cores deviate downward from the larson relation which may correspond to the upper bound of the observed line width - radius relations . until now",
    ", many authors have derived the line width - radius relations for various molecular clouds and cores .",
    "those studies show a scatter in the index and coefficient of the power - law line width - radius relations .",
    "the line widths of the larson relation , @xmath200 , tend to be somewhat larger over the range of 0.01 @xmath10 0.1 pc compared to the other relations and thus may correspond to the upper bound of the relations .",
    "for example , on the basis of the massachusetts - stony brook galactic plane survey data , @xcite derived the relation of @xmath201 , not far from the heyer & brunt relation .",
    "in nearby low - mass star forming regions @xcite compiled the data of dense cores and derived the power - law relation of @xmath202 for starless cores .",
    "if the line width - radius relation of the low - density gas in @xmath4 oph follows the larson relation , instead of the heyer & brunt relation , the smaller line widths of the h@xmath0co@xmath1 cores may suggest that the cores have formed preferentially in regions where supersonic turbulence dissipated and thus the cores so formed have smaller line widths compared to the larson relation .",
    "if this is the case , the nearly independent relationship between the line width and core radius implies that the turbulent field at the small scales has not been relaxed yet , and therefore the timescale of core formation may be of the order of a dynamical time . in that case , it is unclear how protostellar outflows contribute to maintain supersonic turbulence in the cluster environment .",
    "using the archive data of the h@xmath0co@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) molecular line emission taken with the nobeyama 45 m radio telescope , we analyzed the molecular gas distribution in the central dense region of the @xmath4 ophiuchi main cloud .",
    "we summarize the primary results of the paper as follows :    \\1 .",
    "we compared the global distribution of the h@xmath0co@xmath1 emission with that of the 850 @xmath15 m dust continuum emission and found that the overall spatial distributions are similar to each other , while the h@xmath0co@xmath1 emission appears to cover a larger area than the dust continuum emission . by comparing between the h@xmath0co@xmath1 and 850 @xmath15 m maps",
    ", we revealed that the fractional abundance of h@xmath0co@xmath1 relative to h@xmath5 decreases with increasing the h@xmath5 column density as @xmath203 .",
    "this tendency is consistent with the theoretical prediction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the mean fractional abundance in the region is estimated to be @xmath6 .",
    "\\2 . from the 3d data cube of the h@xmath0co@xmath1 emission we identified 68 dense cores using the clumpfind method . from comparison with the positions of ysos recently identified by the spitzer space telescope , the cores are classified into the following two groups : 34 protostellar and 34 starless cores .",
    "the radii , masses , and line widths of the protostellar cores tend to be larger than those of the starless cores .",
    "the virial ratio tends to increase with decreasing the lte mass , although we found no significant difference in the virial ratio between the protostellar and starless cores .",
    "furthermore , the virial ratios of the cores can be well described by the model of a self - gravitating core confined by ambient pressure derived by @xcite , suggesting that both self - gravity and ambient pressure play an important role in dynamics of the cores .",
    "the mass spectrum of the h@xmath0co@xmath1 cores can be fitted by a two - component power - law that resembles the stellar imf in @xmath4 oph .",
    "the core mass spectrum has a break at around @xmath204 , close to the mean lte mass of the cores .",
    "it implies that the stellar imf may be at least partly determined by the core mass distribution .",
    "\\4 . applying the virial analysis",
    ", we conclude that most of the cores are bound and are expected to collapse .",
    "furthermore , for the majority of the cores , the surface pressure term is more important than the gravitational energy term .",
    "this result suggests that in the cluster environment the formation and evolution of the cores may be regulated largely by the surface pressures .",
    "we compared the physical properties of the h@xmath0co@xmath1 cores in @xmath4 oph with those in orion a. to eliminate the effect of the different distances , we smoothed the original @xmath4 oph data into a coarser grid so that the spatial resolutions coincide with each other .",

    "the physical properties of the @xmath4 oph cores identified from the smoothed data appear to resemble those of orion a. the fact that the mean density of the orion a cores ( @xmath187 @xmath14 ) is somewhat smaller than the critical density of h@xmath0co@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) transition of @xmath188 @xmath14 suggests that the orion a cores contain clumpy substructures that could not be spatially resolved .    \\6 .",
    "the range of the line widths of the @xmath4 oph cores identified from the smoothed data almost coincides with that of the original @xmath4 oph cores .",
    "this suggests that the line width - radius relation is more or less flat over the range of 0.01 @xmath10 0.1 pc for the dense gas detected by h@xmath0co@xmath1 .",
    "such a flat relation is inconsistent with that derived from the @xmath30co observations by @xcite who found that the line width correlates strongly with the size for the low - density molecular gas . at the scales below 0.3 pc , the line widths of the @xmath4 oph cores deviate upwards from the heyer & brunt relation .",
    "this may be due to turbulence driven by protostellar outflows . however , if the actual line widths of the low - density gas in @xmath4 oph agree with the values of the larson relation , then the nearly independent relationship between the line width and core radius may be interpreted as evidence that the cores have formed preferentially in regions where supersonic turbulence dissipated .",
    "in the present paper , the fwhm line width and core radius defined by our clumpfind method are used for showing the line width - radius relation of the identified cores . since the different authors use the different definitions of the line width and core radius @xcite , we here convert the other line width - radius relations using our definitions .",
    "@xcite applied the pca analysis to derive the relationship between the line wdith and the size inside the molecular clouds .",
    "their line width @xmath205 and size @xmath206 correspond to the autocorrelation widths on both the spatial and the velocity axes . in the following , we transfer them into our fwhm line width and radius to do a direct comparison with our result .",
    "if both a line and intensity profiles of a core can be approximated by gaussian profiles , then the line width and size defined by @xcite are given by @xmath207 and @xmath208 , where @xmath209 and @xmath210 are the dispersions of the line and intensity profiles , respectively ( see * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the fwhm line width is defined as @xmath211 .",

    "<S> the majority of the identified cores have subsonic internal motions . </S>",
    "<S> the virial ratio , the ratio of the virial mass to the lte mass , tends to decrease with increasing the lte mass and about 60 percent of the cores have virial ratios smaller than 2 , indicating that these cores are not transient structures but self - gravitating . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed virial analysis suggests that the surface pressure often dominates over the self - gravity and thus plays a crucial role in regulating core formation and evolution . by comparing the @xmath4 oph cores with those in the orion a molecular cloud observed with the same telescope </S>",
    "<S> , we found that the statistical properties of the core physical quantities are similar between the two clouds if the effect of the different spatial resolutions is corrected . </S>",
    "<S> the line widths of the @xmath4 oph cores appear to be nearly independent of the core radii over the range of 0.01 @xmath10 0.1 pc and deviate upwards from the heyer & brunt relation . </S>",
    "<S> this may be evidence that turbulent motions are driven by protostellar outflows in the cluster environment . </S>"
