    "particle packing problems are ancient , dating back to the dawn of civilization .",
    "bernal has remarked that `` heaps '' ( particle packings ) were the first things that were ever measured in the form of basketfuls of grain for the purpose of trading or of collection of taxes @xcite .",
    "dense packings of hard particles have served as useful models to understand the structure of liquid , glassy and crystal states of matter @xcite , granular media @xcite , and heterogeneous materials @xcite .",
    "understanding the symmetries and other mathematical properties of the densest packings in arbitrary dimensions is a problem of long - standing interest in discrete geometry and number theory @xcite .    a large collection of nonoverlapping solid objects ( particles ) in @xmath6-dimensional euclidean space @xmath7",
    "is called a packing . the packing density @xmath8",
    "is defined as the fraction of space @xmath7 covered by the particles .",
    "a problem that has been a source of fascination to mathematicians and scientists for centuries is the determination of the densest arrangement(s ) of particles that do not tile space and the associated maximal density @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "finding the maximal - density packing arrangements is directly relevant to understanding the structure and properties of crystalline equilibrium phases of particle systems as well as their ( zero - temperature ) ground - state structures in low dimensions in which the interactions are characterized by steep repulsions and short - ranged attractions .",
    "the preponderance of previous investigations have focused on dense packings of spheres in various dimensions @xcite . for congruent particles in three dimensions ,",
    "the sphere is the only non - tiling particle for which the densest packing arrangements can be proved @xcite .",
    "it is only very recently that attention has turned to finding the maximal - density packing arrangements of nonspherical particles in @xmath0 , including ellipsoids @xcite , tetrahedra @xcite , and superballs @xcite .",
    "very little is known about the densest packings of polyhedral particles @xcite .",
    "+    the platonic solids ( mentioned in plato s timaeus ) are convex polyhedra with faces composed of congruent convex regular polygons .",
    "there are exactly five such solids : the tetrahedron ( p1 ) , icosahedron ( p2 ) , dodecahedron ( p3 ) , octahedron ( p4 ) , and cube ( p5 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ platonic ] ) @xcite .",
    "one major concern in this paper is the determination of the densest packings of each of the platonic solids in three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath0 , except for the cube , which is the only platonic solid that tiles space .",
    "it is useful to highlight some basic geometrical properties of the platonic solids that we will employ in subsequent sections of the paper .",
    "the dihedral angle @xmath10 is the interior angle between any two face planes and is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the number of sides of each face and @xmath13 is the number of faces meeting at each vertex .",
    "thus , @xmath10 is @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , for the tetrahedron , icosahedron , dodecahedron , octahedron , and cube , respectively , where @xmath19 is the golden ratio .",
    "thus , since the dihedral angle for the cube is the only one that is a submultiple of @xmath20 , the cube is the only platonic solid that tiles space .",
    "we note in passing that in addition to the regular tessellation of space by cubes in the simple cubic lattice arrangement , there are an infinite number of other irregular tessellations of space by cubes @xcite . figure [ random - squares ] shows a portion of a realization of a two - dimensional analog of such an irregular tessellation .",
    "every polyhedron has a dual polyhedron with faces and vertices interchanged .",
    "the dual of each platonic solid is another platonic solid , and therefore they can be arranged into dual pairs : the tetrahedron is self - dual ( i.e. , its dual is another tetrahedron ) , the icosahedron and dodecahedron form a dual pair , and the octahedron and cube form a dual pair .",
    "+    an archimedean solid is a highly symmetric , semi - regular convex polyhedron composed of two or more types of regular polygons meeting in identical vertices .",
    "there are thirteen archimedean solids : truncated tetrahedron ( a1 ) , truncated icosahedron ( a2 ) , snub cube ( a3 ) , snub dodecahedron ( a4 ) , rhombicosidodecahdron ( a5 ) , truncated icosidodecahdron ( a6 ) , truncated cuboctahedron ( a7 ) , icosidodecahedron ( a8 ) , rhombicuboctahedron ( a9 ) , truncated dodecahedron ( a10 ) , cuboctahedron ( a11 ) , truncated cube ( a12 ) and truncated octahedron ( a13 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ archimedean ] ) .",
    "note that the truncated octahedron is the only archimedean solid that tiles space .",
    "another important observation is that the tetrahedron ( p1 ) and the truncated tetrahedron ( a1 ) are the only platonic and archimedean solids , respectively , that are not _ centrally symmetric_. a particle is centrally symmetric if it has a center @xmath21 that bisects every chord through @xmath21 connecting any two boundary points of the particle , i.e. , the center is a point of inversion symmetry .",
    "we will see that the central symmetry of the majority of the platonic and archimedean solids ( p2  p5 , a2 ",
    "a13 ) distinguish their dense packing arrangements from those of the non - centrally symmetric ones ( p1 and a1 ) in a fundamental way .",
    "some basic definitions concerning packings are given here .",
    "saturated _ packing is one in which there is no space available to add another particle to the packing .",
    "a _ lattice _",
    "@xmath22 in @xmath7 is a subgroup consisting of the integer linear combinations of vectors that constitute a basis for @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "a _ lattice packing _",
    "@xmath23 is one in which the centroids of the nonoverlapping particles are located at the points of @xmath22 , each oriented in the same direction .",
    "the set of lattice packings is a subset of all possible packings in @xmath7 . in a lattice packing",
    ", the space @xmath7 can be geometrically divided into identical regions @xmath24 called _ fundamental cells _",
    ", each of which contains just the centroid of one particle .",
    "thus , the density of a lattice packing is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the volume of a @xmath6-dimensional particle and @xmath27 is the volume of a fundamental cell .    a more general notion than a lattice packing is a periodic packing .",
    "a _ periodic _ packing of congruent particles is obtained by placing a fixed nonoverlapping configuration of @xmath28 particles ( where @xmath29 ) with _ arbitrary orientations _ in each fundamental cell of a lattice @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the packing is still periodic under translations by @xmath22 , but the @xmath28 particles can occur anywhere in the chosen fundamental cell subject to the nonoverlap condition .",
    "the packing density of a periodic packing is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number density , i.e. , the number of particles per unit volume .",
    "the determination of the maximal - density arrangements of non - tiling polyhedral particles is a notoriously difficult problem , especially since such extremal structures will generally be non - bravais - lattice packings .",
    "computer simulations that seek the maximal - density packings can be an indispensable tool , especially if they can incorporate collective motions of the particles in order to obtain , in principle , the highest possible densities",
    ". however , the challenge presented by polyhedral particles in @xmath0 is the non - smooth ( i.e. , nonanalytic ) nature of the particle shape . in the case of smoothly - shaped particles , such as spheres , ellipsoids and superballs , one can construct analytic  overlap potential functions \" for the particles @xcite and hence one can employ efficient collision - driven molecular dynamics ( md ) growth packing algorithms that inherently involve collective particle motions @xcite .",
    "the fact that analytic overlap potential functions can not be constructed for polyhedral particles prevents us from using event - driven md growth methods to study such systems .    in this paper",
    ", we devise a novel optimization scheme , called the adaptive shrinking cell ( asc ) , that can be applied to generate dense packings of polyhedra in @xmath0 .",
    "we employ it specifically to obtain the densest known packings of tetrahedra , icosahedra , dodecahedra , and octahedra with densities @xmath32 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the result for tetrahedra improves upon the density reported in our recent investigation @xcite . unlike the densest tetrahedral packing , which must not be a bravais lattice packing @xcite , the densest packings of the other non - tiling platonic solids that we obtain are their corresponding densest lattice packings @xcite .",
    "we also derive a simple upper bound on the maximal density of packings of congruent nonspherical particles , and apply it to platonic solids , archimedean solids , superballs and ellipsoids .",
    "we introduce the  asphericity \" parameter @xmath33 ( ratio of the circumradius to inradius ) to show that when @xmath33 is sufficiently small , the upper bounds are relatively tight and thus close to the corresponding densities of the optimal lattice packings of octahedra , dodecahedra and icosahedra as well as of the majority of the archimedean solids with central symmetry .",
    "our simulation results as well as theoretical arguments lead us to conjecture that the densest packings of platonic and archimedean solids with central symmetry are given by their corresponding densest lattice packings .",
    "this can be regarded to be the analog of kepler s sphere conjecture for these solids .",
    "the truncated tetrahedron is the only non - centrally symmetric archimedean solid , the densest known packing of which is a non - lattice packing with density as high as @xmath5 .",
    "our work also suggests that the optimal packings of superballs are their corresponding densest lattice packings .    in a recent letter @xcite",
    ", we briefly reported the densest known packings of the non - tiling platonic solids obtained using the asc algorithm and proposed the aforementioned conjecture concerning the optimal packings of the platonic and archimedean solids . in this paper , we expand on theoretical and computational details and report additional new results .",
    "in particular , we provide comprehensive details about the asc scheme and the simulation results ( sec .",
    "ii ) , including a discussion about the various initial configurations we used for the asc algorithm ( sec .",
    "moreover , we have improved on the highest tetrahedral packing density reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ( i.e. , from @xmath34 to @xmath1 ) , by exploring a broad range of dynamical parameters for the algorithm and initial configurations .",
    "certain pair statistics of the densest known packing of tetrahedra ( e.g. , the contact number , the centroidal correlation function and the face - normal correlation function ) are given ( sec .",
    "it is noteworthy that the densest tetrahedral packing is a non - bravais structure with a complex periodic cell and possesses _ no long - range order_.    the initial configurations for the icosahedral , dodecahedral and octahedral packings are described and the numerical challenges in producing dense packings of such polyhedral particles are discussed ( sec .",
    "in addition , a detailed derivation of the upper bound and tables containing the geometrical characteristics of the platonic and archimedean solids as well as their upper bound values are given ( sec .",
    "the upper bound is also applied to superballs and ellipsoids ( which was not done in ref .",
    "moreover , we provide the major elements of a possible proof of our conjecture ( sec .",
    "we also discuss how our conjecture could be generalized to other centrally symmetric polyhedral particles such as prisms and anti - prisms as well as high - dimensional analogs of the platonic solids .",
    "our work also naturally leads to another conjecture reported here for the first time , namely , the optimal packing of any convex , congruent polyhedron without central symmetry is generally not a ( bravais ) lattice packing ( sec .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the possible applications and generalizations of the asc scheme to predict the crystal structures of polyhedral nanoparticles and to the study of random packings of hard polyhedra .",
    "finally , we collect in appendices basic packing characteristics of various optimal lattice and non - lattice packings of polyhedra ( including lattice vectors ) that have been scattered throughout the literature and provide lattice vectors and other characteristics of the densest known packings of tetrahedra ( obtained here ) and truncated tetrahedra .",
    "we formulate the problem of generating dense packings of nonoverlapping , non - tiling polyhedra within a fundamental cell in @xmath0 subject to periodic boundary conditions as an optimization problem .",
    "in particular , the objective function is taken to be the negative of the packing density @xmath8 . starting from an initial unsaturated packing configuration of particles of fixed size in the fundamental cell , the positions and orientations of the polyhedra are design variables for the optimization .",
    "importantly , we also allow the boundary of the fundamental cell to deform macroscopically as well as compress or expand ( while keeping the particles fixed in size ) such that there is a net compression ( increase of the density of the packing ) in the final state @xcite .",
    "thus , the deformation and compression / expansion of the cell boundary , which we call the _ adaptive fundamental cell _ , are also design variables .",
    "we are not aware of any packing algorithm that employs both a _ sequential _ search of the configurational space of the particles and the space of lattices via an adaptive fundamental cell that shrinks on average to obtain dense packings . we will call this optimization scheme the adaptive shrinking cell ( asc ) .",
    "we will see that the asc optimization scheme allows for some desired collective motions of the particles to find the optimal lattice for the periodic cell .",
    "this is to be contrasted with previous treatments that use a fixed shape for the fundamental cell , which may or may not be the optimal shape .",
    "figure [ fig_cell ] illustrates a simple sequence of configuration changes for a four - particle system ( which is explained in more detail in sec .",
    "ii.a ) . by efficiently exploring the design - variable space ( dvs ) , which consists of the particle configurational space as well as the space of lattices via an adaptive fundamental cell ,",
    "the asc scheme enables one to find a point in the dvs in the neighborhood of the starting point that has a higher packing density than the initial density .",
    "the process is continued until the deepest minimum of the objective function ( a maximum of packing density ) is obtained , which could be either a local or global optimum , depending on the particle shapes .",
    "@xmath35{deform_cell_a2.eps } & \\includegraphics[width=5.0cm , keepaspectratio]{deform_cell_b2.eps } & \\includegraphics[width=5.0cm , keepaspectratio]{deform_cell_c2.eps } \\\\ \\mbox{\\bf ( a ) } & \\mbox{\\bf ( b ) } & \\mbox{\\bf ( c ) } \\end{array}$ ]    the asc optimization problem could be solved using various techniques , depending on the shapes of the particles .",
    "for example , for spheres , one can linearize the objective function and the constraints , and we have found that linear programming techniques can efficiently produce optimal solutions for such asc problems @xcite . however , for hard polyhedra the non - overlapping conditions given by the separation axis theorem ( discussed in detail below ) involve at least quartic inequalities , which makes it inefficient to solve even using nonlinear programming methods .    here , for polyhedral particles , we solve the asc optimization problem using a stochastic procedure , i.e. , monte carlo ( mc ) method with a metropolis acceptance rule for trial moves to search the dvs efficiently .",
    "however , it is important to distinguish our procedure that incorporates deformation and compression / expansion of the fundamental cell ( i.e. , the space of lattices ) as design variables from previous mc hard - particle packing algorithms @xcite . in standard mc simulations ,",
    "arbitrarily selected individual particle is given random displacement or rotation .",
    "this sequential movement method is not able to account for any collective motions of the particles , which is crucial to increasing the packing density , as pointed out in sec .",
    "i. in our procedure , the deformation / compression / expansion of the boundary at least in part allows for collective particle motions in a direction leading to higher packing density .",
    "moreover , it is the overall compression of the fundamental cell that causes the packing density to increase , not the growth of the particles as in most md and mc hard - particle packing algorithms @xcite .    at first glance",
    ", one might surmise that an algorithm that employs particle growth with an adaptive non - shrinking fundamental cell is equivalent to our choice of fixing the particle size while allowing the cell to shrink on average .",
    "the former is computationally less efficient than the latter for polyhedral particles .",
    "specifically , growth of polyhedral particles requires manipulating the coordinates of the vertices of each particle , and thus involves at least @xmath36 numerical operations , where @xmath6 is the spatial dimension , @xmath28 is the total number of particles in the system and @xmath37 is the number of vertices per particle .",
    "it is much more computationally expensive to use growing / shrinking particles as trial moves for the optimization scheme , especially when the number of particles is large , compared to our adaptive fundamental cell approach , which only requires manipulating @xmath38 strain components .    in the asc scheme ,",
    "the macroscopic deformation and compression / expansion of the fundamental cell of the lattice is completely specified by a strain tensor .",
    "since we only consider small deformations , linear strain analysis can be applied here .",
    "starting from an initial configuration , a trial configuration can be generated by moving ( translating and rotating ) a randomly chosen particle or by a random macroscopic deformation and compression / expansion of the fundamental cell .",
    "if any two particles overlap , the trial configuration is rejected ; otherwise , if the fundamental cell shrinks in size ( which makes the density @xmath8 higher ) , the trial configuration is accepted . on the other hand ,",
    "if the cell expands in size , the trial configuration is accepted with a specified probability @xmath39 , which decreases as @xmath8 increases and approaches zero when the jamming limit @xcite ( i.e. , locally maximal dense packing ) is reached . in particular",
    ", we find @xmath39 , with an initial value @xmath40 , decreasing as a power law with exponent equal to -1 works well for most systems that we studied .",
    "the particle motion is equally likely to be a translation or a rotation .",
    "the ratio of the number of particle motions to the number of boundary trial moves should be greater than unity ( especially towards the end of the simulation ) , since compressing a dense packing could result in many overlaps between the particles .",
    "depending on the initial density , the magnitudes of the particle motions and strain components ( e.g. , the dynamical parameters ) need to be chosen carefully to avoid the system getting stuck in some shallow local minimum .",
    "the parameters should also be adjusted accordingly as the packing density increases , especially towards the jamming point .",
    "the number of total monte - carlo moves per particle is of the order of @xmath41 .    in the ensuing subsections ,",
    "we describe in detail how we implement particle motions as well as the deformation and compression / expansion of the fundamental cell , and precise check for interparticle overlaps using the separation axis theorem @xcite .",
    "we also discuss the cell method and nearest - neighbor lists that are employed to speed up the simulations .",
    "the fact that a polyhedron is the convex hull of its vertices makes the set of vertices a useful geometrical representation of a such particle .",
    "it is convenient to choose the origin of the local coordinate system for the vertices to be the centroid of the polyhedron .",
    "other important geometrical properties of the polyhedron , such as its faces and edges , can be represented as certain subsets of the vertices .",
    "let the euclidean position of the centroid of the @xmath42th particle be @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "a translational motion of the particle centroid can be obtained by generating a randomly oriented displacement @xmath45 with small magnitude ( @xmath46 of the characteristic length of the particle ) , i.e. , @xmath47 a rotational motion can be generated by rotating the particle ( all of its vertices ) along a randomly chosen axis ( passing through its centroid ) by a random small angle @xmath10 .",
    "let the vector @xmath48 originating at the centroid denote the vertex @xmath49 .",
    "we have @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the components of @xmath48 perpendicular and parallel to the rotation axis , respectively , and @xmath53 is the rotation matrix , i.e. , @xmath54.\\ ] ] if this motion does not result in the overlap with another particle , the trial move is accepted ; otherwise it is rejected .",
    "for a lattice - based periodic packing , the fundamental cell is specified by the lattice vectors @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "recall that the euclidean coordinates of the particle centroids are @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the relative coordinates of the centroids with respect to the lattice vectors are given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "the adaptive fundamental cell allows for a small strain of the fundamental cell , including both volume and shape changes , which is represented by a symmetric strain tensor @xmath59 , i.e. , @xmath60 where @xmath61,\\ ] ] and the new fundamental cell ( lattice vectors ) are given by @xmath62 substituting the above equation into eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , we have @xmath63    thus , the strain of the fundamental cell corresponds to non - trivial _ collective _ motions of the particle centroids ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_cell ] ) . in general , the translational motions of the particles contain the contributions from a random independent part ( given by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) ) and the collective motion imposed by the adaptive fundamental cell .",
    "it is this collective motion that enables the algorithm to explore the configuration space more efficiently and to produce highly dense packings .",
    "hard polyhedron particles , unlike spheres , ellipsoids and superballs , do not possess simple overlap potential functions .",
    "thus , the check of overlapping for such particles requires other techniques .",
    "two convex objects are separated in space if and only if there exist an axis , on which the line segments defined by projections of the two objects do not overlap ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_axis ] ) .",
    "this statement is usually referred to as the _ separation axis theorem _",
    "( sat ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath64{sep_axi.eps } \\\\ \\end{array}$ ]    for convex polyhedra , the above theorem has a simpler version .",
    "since a polyhedron is completely defined by its vertices , the line segment on the axis is defined by the most separated two projections of the vertices . moreover ,",
    "the axis is either perpendicular to one of the faces or perpendicular to a pair of edges , one from each polyhedron .",
    "this reduces the number of axes that need to be checked from infinity to @xmath65 $ ] , where @xmath66 and @xmath24 is the number of edges and faces of the polyhedron , respectively . here",
    "we employ the sat to check for interparticle overlaps numerically up to the highest machine precision .    for polyhedra",
    "whose circumscribed and inscribed spheres are well defined , two particles are guaranteed to overlap if the centroidal separation is smaller than the inscribed diameter and guaranteed not to overlap if the centroidal separation is larger than the circumscribed diameter .",
    "this pre - check dramatically speeds up the simulations starting from configurations with low densities .",
    "@xmath64{periodic.eps } \\\\ \\end{array}$ ]    the well - developed cell method @xcite for particle - system simulation is used here to speed up the process .",
    "however , the simulation box ( fundamental cell ) will not remain a cube during the simulation and several conventional techniques developed for cubic box need modifications .",
    "in particular , to obtain the minimum image distances , all surrounding boxes need to be checked explicitly ( see fig .  [ fig_periodic ] ) . with the help of the relative - coordinate representation of the particle centroids ,",
    "the separation vector of a pair of particles is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a vector with the values of components to be 1 , 0 or -1 .",
    "note @xmath68 can also be considered as the index of the box that the image particle is in .",
    "the cells are taken to be the same shapes as the simulation box .",
    "partitions of the particle centroids into the cells are also convenient for relative coordinate representations , i.e. , the index of the cell ( represented by a vector ) @xmath69 for particle @xmath49 is given by @xmath70,\\ ] ] where @xmath71 $ ] gives the smallest integer part of @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the number of cells .",
    "note that the boundary deformations and rotations of particles do not affect the cells in which the particles are situated ; only translations may cause transitions between the different cells .    for dense packings , we make use of a near - neighbor list ( nnl ) to further improve the efficiency of the algorithm @xcite . in particular ,",
    "when the packing density is high , each particle is  trapped \" in a `` cage '' formed by its near neighbors .",
    "these near - neighbor configurations are practically stationary , i.e. , the particles undergo very small  jiggling \" motions .",
    "thus , to check for overlapping between the particles , one only needs to consider a particles nearest neighbors .",
    "if a large magnitude translation is made , the nnl needs to be set up again .",
    "here we apply the asc scheme to obtain the densest known packings of the non - tiling platonic solids . due to its lack of central symmetry ,",
    "the tetrahedron presents the greatest challenge for the numerical solution procedure of the asc scheme because of its tendency to get stuck in local ( density ) minima , which is a consequence of the associated  rugged \" energy or , more precisely ,  density \" landscape ( e.g. , the packing density as function of the centroidal positions and orientations of all of the particles in the fundamental cell ) .",
    "hence , the choice of initial configurations becomes crucial in getting dense tetrahedral packings .",
    "by contrast , the central symmetry of the octahedron , dodecahedron and icosahedron results in density landscapes for the numerical procedure that are appreciably less rugged than that for tetrahedral packings .",
    "the determination of the densest packings of regular tetrahedra is part of the 18th problem of hilbert s famous set of problems .",
    "it is of interest to note that the densest ( bravais ) lattice packing of tetrahedra ( which requires all of the tetrahedra to have the same orientations ) has the relatively low density @xmath74 and each tetrahedron touches 14 others @xcite .",
    "recently , conway and torquato showed that the densest packings of regular tetrahedra must not be a bravais lattice packings , and found packings with density as large as @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "one such packing is based upon the filling of  imaginary \" icosahedra with the densest arrangement of 20 tetrahedra and then employing the densest lattice packing of icosahedra .",
    "a slightly higher density was achieved by a perturbation of the so - called  welsh \" packings with density @xmath76 @xcite . using ",
    "tetrahedral \" dice , chaikin et al .",
    "@xcite experimentally generated jammed disordered packings of such dice with @xmath77 .",
    "even though the dice are not perfect tetrahedra ( because the vertices and edges are slightly rounded ) , these experimental results suggested that the densest packings of tetrahedra could exceed the highest densities reported by conway and torquato .",
    "indeed , chen @xcite has recently discovered a periodic packing of tetrahedra with @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "we will call this the  wagon - wheels \" packing because the basic subunits consist of two orthogonally intersecting  wagon \" wheels .",

    ", event - driven molecular dynamics growth algorithms as well as theoretical arguments led to the conjecture that the densest packings of superballs for all convex shapes ( @xmath89 ) are certain lattice packings , depending on the value of the deformation parameter @xmath12 .    for convex superballs in the octahedral regime ( @xmath90 ) , the upper bound ( [ bound ] )",
    "is explicitly given by @xmath91 similarly , for superballs in the cubic regime ( @xmath92 ) , the upper bound ( [ bound ] ) is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 is the euler gamma function .",
    "here and in the subsequent paragraphs concerning ellipsoids , we only state the nontrivial part of the upper bound ( [ bound ] ) . for @xmath12 near the sphere point ( @xmath84 ) , the densest lattice packings @xcite have densities that lie relatively close to the corresponding upper - bound values .",

    "this is due to the fact that the three principle directions ( axes ) are not equivalent for an ellipsoid , i.e. , it generally possesses different semiaxes .",
    "note that the three equivalent principle ( orthogonal ) axes ( directions ) of a centrally symmetric particle are those directions that are two - fold rotational symmetry axes such that the distances from the particle centroids to the particle surfaces are equal .",
    "in addition , the asphericity of an ellipsoid increases linearly as the largest aspect ratio @xmath115 increases without limit .",
    "by contrast , the three principle directions are equivalent for the centrally - symmetric platonic and archimedean solids as well as for superballs , for which the asphericity is always bounded and close to unity ( see tables [ plat ] and [ arch ] ) .",
    "thus , we see that an asphericity value close to unity is a necessary condition to have a centrally symmetric particle in which the three principle directions are equivalent .",
    "we have formulated the problem of generating dense packings of nonoverlapping polyhedra within an adaptive fundamental cell subject to periodic boundary conditions as an optimization problem , which we call the adaptive shrinking cell ( asc ) scheme .",
    "the procedure allows both a sequential search of the configurational space of the particles and the space of lattices via an adaptive fundamental cell that shrinks on average to obtain dense packings . we have applied the asc to generate the densest known packings of the platonic solids .    for tetrahedra",
    ", we find a packing with density @xmath116 , which is a periodic ( non - bravais lattice ) packing with a complex basis . unlike the other platonic solids , finding dense packings of tetrahedra with our algorithm requires having good initial configurations .",
    "the densest packing was found using 314 particles in a rhombical fundamental cell that is similar to that of the hexagonal close packing . as we stressed in our earlier work @xcite and",
    "continue to confirm in this paper , it is possible that denser packings of tetrahedra will involve increasingly larger numbers of particles in the fundamental cell .",
    "in fact , the higher density found here is realized by a larger periodic packing ( 314 particles per cell ) than the one reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ( 72 particles per cell ) with density @xmath117 .",
    "it is apparent the obtained densest known tetrahedral packing is disordered in the sense that it possesses no long - range order , at least on the scale of the simulation box .",
    "this packing can be considered to be a disordered `` mixture '' of distorted wagon wheels and individual tetrahedra and it is distinct from the one reported in ref .",
    "@xcite in both the arrangement of the wagon wheels and the extent of the distortion of the wagon wheels .",
    "although we can not rule out the possibility of the existence of denser packings involving a more ordered arrangement of the wagon wheels and individual tetrahedra , it is reasonable to expect that wagon wheels will be key building blocks in denser packings and should at least be slightly distorted to fill the interparticle gaps in wagon - wheel clusters more efficiently , which necessarily introduces a certain degree of disorder to the packing . if denser packings of tetrahedra must involve larger number of particles without long - range order , than it raises the amazing prospect that the densest packings of tetrahedra might be truly disordered , due to the geometrical frustration associated with the lack of central symmetry of a tetrahedron and that tetrahedra can not tile space .",
    "this would be the first example of a maximally dense packing of congruent convex three - dimensional particles without long - range order .",
    "however , we can not offer definitive conclusions about this possibility at this stage .",
    "it is clear that in future work in the search for denser packings , increasingly larger number of tetrahedra must be considered , which can only be studied using greater computational resources .",
    "our simulation results and rigorous upper bounds strongly suggest that the optimal lattice packings of the centrally symmetric platonic solids ( octahedra , dodecahedra and icosahedra ) are indeed the densest packings of these particles , especially since these arise from a variety of initial `` dilute '' multi - particle configurations within the fundamental cell @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that a different simulation procedure ( an event - driven molecular dynamics growth algorithm with an adaptive fundamental cell ) has recently been used to demonstrate that the densest packings of octahedral - like superballs ( which contains the perfect octahedron ) are likely to be the optimal lattice packings @xcite .",
    "moreover , the fact that the optimal lattice packing densities of certain centrally symmetric nonspherical particles , such as the archimedean solids with central symmetry and convex superballs , are relatively close to their upper bounds as well as other theoretical arguments given below suggest that the densest packings of these particles may also be given by their optimal lattice packings .",
    "it is crucial to stress that the nonspherical particles in this family do not deviate appreciably from a sphere , i.e. , their corresponding asphericity @xmath33 is always bounded and relatively close to unity , and , moreover , their three principle axes ( directions ) are equivalent .",
    "this is in contrast to the ellipsoid , which , although centrally symmetric , generally possesses three principle axes ( directions ) that are inequivalent and its asphericity can increase without limit as the largest aspect ratio grows .",
    "these characteristics suggest that the densest ellipsoid arrangements are non - lattice packings , which indeed has been verified @xcite .",
    "our simulation results and the ensuing theoretical arguments lead to the following conjecture :    conjecture 1 : _ the densest packings of the centrally symmetric platonic solids are given by their corresponding optimal lattice packings . _",
    "we now sketch what could be the major elements of a proof of this conjecture . in the case of each of the platonic solids , face - to - face contacts",
    "are favored over vertex - to - face contacts to achieve higher packing densities , since the former allows the particle centroids to get closer to one another .",
    "such contacting neighbor configurations around each particle reduce the volume of the corresponding convex hull joining the centroids of the contacting particles , and the fraction of space covered by the particles within this convex hull should be increased ; see fig .  [ octagon_pack ] for a two - dimensional illustration .",
    "@xmath118{octagon_a.eps } & \\includegraphics[height=3.0cm , keepaspectratio]{octagon_b.eps } & \\includegraphics[height=3.0cm , keepaspectratio]{octagon_c.eps } & \\includegraphics[height=3.0cm , keepaspectratio]{octagon_d.eps } \\\\ \\mbox{\\bf ( a ) } & \\mbox{\\bf ( b ) } & \\mbox{\\bf ( c ) } & \\mbox{\\bf ( d ) } \\end{array}$ ]    to achieve the densest packing , the fraction of space covered by the particles within the convex hull should ideally be maximized and so should the number of face - to - face contacts per particle . of course , this is only a local criterion that may not be consistent with the densest global packing .",
    "however , it will be seen that the equivalence of the three principle directions of a centrally symmetric platonic solid is crucial for this local optimization criterion to be consistent with the globally densest packing .",
    "it is noteworthy that orienting each of the particles in the packings of centrally symmetric platonic solids enable a larger number of face - to - face contacts and thus allows the maximal fraction of space covered by the particles within the convex hull .",
    "for example , a particle with @xmath24 faces , possesses @xmath119 families of axes that go through the centroid of the particle and intersect the centrally - symmetric face pairs such that the particles ( in the same orientation ) with their centroids arranged on these axes form face - to - face contacts .",
    "the requirement that the particles have the same orientation is globally consistent with a lattice packing .",
    "indeed , in the optimal lattice packings of the centrally symmetric platonic solids , each particle has the maximum number of face - to - face contacts that could be obtained without violating the impenetrability condition .",
    "it is highly unlikely that such particles possessing three equivalent principle directions and aligned in the same direction could form a more complicated non - lattice periodic packings with densities that are larger than the optimal lattice packings .",
    "such non - lattice packings would arise to take advantage of the rotational degrees of freedom . by requiring particle alignments ,",
    "only translational degrees of freedom remain and hence optimization over these degrees of freedom would lead to the globally optimal packings , which should be lattice packings . constraining rotational degrees of freedom in this way in a non - lattice packing would at best lead to a local optimum in density .",
    "this conclusion is clearly supported by our simulations , which use multiple - particle configurations in the fundamental cell and only produce the optimal lattice packings .    in the aforementioned arguments ,",
    "a key step that is difficult to prove is the observation that alignment of each of the particles maximizes the number of face - to - face contacts and thus the fraction of space covered by the particles within the convex hull joining the centroids of the contacting neighbors around a central polyhedron .",
    "a rigorous verification of this step would lead to the consistency of the aforementioned local and global optimization criteria .",
    "it is noteworthy that in two dimensions , our local criterion to achieve the optimal packings of centrally symmetric regular polygons ( the two - dimensional counterparts of the centrally symmetric platonic solids ) amounts to the identification of optimal neighbor configurations with the maximal edge - to - edge contacts per particle such that the convex hull joining the centroids of the contacting neighbors is minimal .",
    "this statement is rigorously true in two dimensions because it is tantamount to a theorem due to fejes tth @xcite , which states that the densest packing of a centrally symmetric particle in two dimensions can be obtained by circumscribing the particle with the minimal centrally symmetric hexagon , which of course tiles @xmath120 . finding the minimal circumscribing centrally symmetric hexagon is equivalent to finding the minimal area convex hull joining the centroids of the six contacting particles ( the maximal number can be obtained in two dimensions for centrally symmetric particles ) .",
    "the fact that local optimality is consistent with the global optimality in two dimensions ( e.g. , a centrally symmetric hexagon can always tessellate the space ) does not hold in three dimensions .",
    "although we have presented a three - dimensional generalization of the fejes tth theorem , by replacing the minimal hexagon with the minimal convex - hull volume , as pointed out before , it is extremely difficult to provide a rigorous proof for it .",
    "although conjecture 1 applies to the centrally symmetric platonic solids , all of our arguments apply as well to each of the centrally symmetric archimedean solids .",
    "it can not be true for the truncated tetrahedron , which is the only non - centrally symmetric archimedean solid .",
    "specifically , it immediately follows from the results of ref . that a non - lattice packing of truncated tetrahedra can be constructed based on the `` primitive welsh '' tessellation ( i.e. , by removing the small regular tetrahedra ) that possesses the density @xmath121 , which is appreciably larger than the optimal - lattice - packing density of @xmath122 , and contains two particle centroids per fundamental cell .",
    "in fact , given that the truncated tetrahedra can not tile space , the density of the `` primitive welsh '' packing of truncated tetrahedra is so large that it may be the optimal packing of such particles .",
    "the lattice vectors of this periodic packing are given in appendix c.    since the arguments used to justify conjecture 1 apply equally well to the 12 centrally symmetric archimedean solids , we are led to the following more general conjecture :    conjecture 2 : _ the densest packings of the centrally symmetric platonic and archimedean solids are given by their corresponding optimal lattice packings .",
    "_    the aforementioned arguments can also be extended to the case of superballs , but here the local principle curvatures at the contacting points should be sufficiently small so as to maximize the fraction of space covered by the particles within the convex hull joining the centroids of the neighbors .",
    "the central symmetry and equivalence of the three principle directions of superballs means that dense packings of such objects are favored when the particles are aligned , which again leads to consistency between local and global optimality .",
    "the fact that the optimal lattice packing densities of superballs is relatively close to the upper - bound values , at least around the sphere point , as well as results from previous molecular dynamics simulations @xcite also strongly suggest that the densest packings of these particles are given by their corresponding optimal lattice packings .",
    "it is noteworthy that under the assumption that conjecture 2 is valid , one has upper bounds that are the complete analog of ( [ lemma ] ) , i.e. , @xmath123 , \\label{lemma2}\\ ] ] where @xmath124 is the volume of an appropriately chosen centrally symmetric platonic or archimedean solid and @xmath125 is the corresponding optimal density for such a solid , which according to conjecture 2 is the optimal lattice packing .",
    "this bound will generally be sharper than bound ( [ lemma ] ) because the reference optimal packing is less symmetric than the sphere .",
    "for example , the conjectured bound ( [ lemma2 ] ) will be sharp for slightly deformed platonic and archimedean solids or nonspherical particles derived by smoothing the vertices , edges and faces of polyhedra .",
    "@xmath126{cut_square_a.eps } & \\includegraphics[height=4.35cm , keepaspectratio]{cut_square_b.eps } \\\\ \\mbox{\\bf ( a ) } & \\mbox{\\bf ( b ) }   \\end{array}$ ]    our work also naturally leads to another conjecture :    conjecture 3 : _ the optimal packing of any convex , congruent polyhedron without central symmetry generally is not a ( bravais ) lattice packing . _    in other words , the set of such polyhedra whose optimal packing is not a lattice is overwhelmingly larger than the set whose optimal packing is a lattice .",
    "we have seen that because the regular tetrahedron and truncated tetrahedron lack central symmetry , dense packings of such objects favor face - to - face contacts .",
    "such orientations immediately eliminate the possibility that lattice packings ( in which particles must have the same orientations ) are optimal .",
    "similarly , it is very plausible that dense packings of most convex , congruent polyhedra without central symmetry are facilitated by face - to - face contacts and hence the optimal packings can not be lattices .",
    "for example , consider a square with one missing corner , i.e. , an isosceles triangle with a right angle ( see fig .",
    "[ cut_square ] ) . at first glance",
    ", one might surmise that if the missing piece is sufficiently small , the original lattice packing should still be optimal or nearly optimal ( see fig .",
    "[ cut_square]a ) , since lattice packings are optimal for squares .",
    "however , no matter how small the missing piece may be , a periodic packing in which the fundamental cell contains two pentagons can be constructed that tile the plane ( see fig .",
    "[ cut_square]b ) .",
    "this is done by taking advantage of the asymmetry of the particle .",
    "thus , we see from this counterintuitive example that if the particle does not possess central symmetry , it is possible to exploit its rotational degrees of freedom to yield a periodic packing with a complex basis that are generally denser than the optimal lattice packing . on the other hand , there are special cases where the lattice will be optimal , such as for the rhombic dodecahedron that has one corner clipped @xcite .",
    "however , these special cases are overwhelmed in number by those whose optimal packings are not lattices .",
    "if conjecture 3 is valid , it also applies to nonspherical particles derived by smoothing the vertices , edges and faces of polyhedra provided that the particle curvature at face - to - face contacts is sufficiently small .",
    "it should not go unnoticed that the densest packings of all of the platonic and archimedean solids reported here as well as the densest known packings of superballs @xcite and ellipsoids @xcite have densities that exceed the optimal sphere packing density @xmath127 .",
    "these results are consistent with a conjecture of ulam who proposed , without any justification , that the optimal density for packing congruent spheres is smaller than that for any other convex body @xcite .",
    "the sphere is perfectly isotropic with an asphericity @xmath33 of unity , and therefore , as noted earlier , its rotational degrees of freedom are irrelevant in affecting its packing characteristics .",
    "on the other hand , each of the aforementioned convex non - spherical particles break the continuous rotational symmetry of the sphere and thus its broken symmetry can be exploited to yield the densest possible packings .",
    "however , broken rotational symmetry in and of itself may not be sufficient to satisfy ulam s conjecture if the convex particle has a little or no symmetry .",
    "it will also be interesting to determine whether our conjecture can be extended to other polyhedral packings .",
    "the infinite families of prisms and antiprisms @xcite provide such a class of packings .",
    "prism _ is a polyhedron having bases that are parallel , congruent polygons and sides that are parallelograms .",
    "an _ antiprism _ is a polyhedron having bases that are parallel , congruent polygons and sides that are alternating bands of triangles .",
    "prisms with an even number of sides and antiprisms are centrally symmetric .",
    "although prisms and antiprisms are naturally grouped with the archimedean solids ( i.e. , they are polyhedra in which the same regular polygons appear at each vertex ) , they are generally much less symmetric than either the platonic or archimedean solids .",
    "moreover , even the centrally symmetric prisms and antiprisms generally do not possess three equivalent directions .",
    "thus , it is less obvious whether bravais lattices would still provide the optimal packings for these solids , except for prisms that tile space ( e.g. , hexagonal prism or rhombical prisms ) . in future work",
    ", it would be desirable to test whether our conjecture extends to prisms and antiprisms that possess central symmetry and three equivalent directions using the asc scheme .",
    "it is worth noting that in four dimensions , the analogs of the tetrahedron , cube , octahedron , dodecahedron and icosahedron are the four - dimensional regular simplex , hypercube , cross polytope , 120-cell and 600-cell , respectively .",
    "all of these four - dimensional polytopes possess central symmetry , except for the simplex @xcite . while the hypercube and cross polytope tile @xmath128 , the optimal packings of simplices are still likely to be non - lattices . since our conjecture for",
    "the three - dimensional platonic solids should still apply in four dimensions , the densest packings of the 120-cell and 600-cell could be their corresponding optimal lattice packings .",
    "the cross polytopes for @xmath129 no longer tile space , and their optimal packings may still be their densest lattice packings provided that @xmath6 is sufficiently small .",
    "however , in sufficiently high dimensions , the densest lattice packings of the centrally symmetric polytopes are probably no longer optimal , since lattice packings in high dimensions are known to possess huge  holes \" into which additional particles can be inserted , yielding higher packing densities with possibly non - lattice arrangements .",
    "indeed , it has recently been argued that disordered sphere packings in very high dimensions could be denser than any ordered packing @xcite .",
    "recent progress in particle synthesis methods have enabled the production of a wide spectrum of nanoparticle shapes such as tetrahedra @xcite , cubes @xcite , icosahedra @xcite and prisms @xcite . in such applications , it would be of great interest to predict the corresponding crystal structures , which might possess unusual symmetries and properties .",
    "the idea of incorporating collective particle motions due to the adaptive fundamental cell should still make it efficient to search the desired crystal structures formed by those polyhedral nano - building blocks .",

    ", the authors suggested ( not conjectured ) that the regular tetrahedron  may not be able to pack as densely as the sphere , which would contradict a conjecture of ulam . \"",
    "indeed , the results of ref . verifies that the tetrahedron does not violate ulam s conjecture .        the fundamental cells of the initial configurations for the optimization algorithm involve periodic copies of the packings listed in table  i. specifically , if the lattice vectors of the packings listed in table  i are denoted by @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 , then the lattice vectors associated with the initial configurations are given by @xmath206 , @xmath207 and @xmath208 , where @xmath209 are integers .",
    "thus , the number of tetrahedra in the fundamental cells of the initial configurations is an integral multiple , i.e. , @xmath210 , of that for the corresponding packings given in table  i. for the optimal lattice packing , @xmath211 ; for the uniform packing , @xmath211 ; for the welsh packing , @xmath212 ; for the icosahedral packing , @xmath213 ; and for the wagon - wheels packing , @xmath214 .",
    "this bound was motivated by a question posed by robert connelly in may , 2005 at a banff international research station workshop entitled ",
    "densest packings of spheres , \" organized by k. bezdek , h. cohn and c. radin . specifically , he asked whether an upper bound on the maximal density of congruent ellipsoid packings in @xmath0 that is less than unity for any aspect ratios of the ellipsoid could be formulated .",
    "one of us in attendance ( s. t. ) provided the version of upper bound ( [ lemma ] ) for the special case of ellipsoids .",
    "of course , for ellipsoids , the bound ( [ lemma ] ) is less than unity provided that the eccentricity of the ellipsoid is sufficiently small .",
    "however , here we recognize that the same type of upper bound can yield a reasonably tight upper bound for other nonspherical shapes provided that the particle has a small asphericity @xmath33 .",
    "although we can not exclude the possibility that there exist other optimal packing particle arrangements that possess the same density as the optimal lattice packings , it is highly unlikely that those arrangements could be constructed in the same way way as the stacking variants of the optimal fcc lattice packings for spheres ( the so - called barlow packings ) .",
    "the polyhedral shape of the particles does not allow them to fit snugly into the `` holes '' formed in the particle layers above and below a particular layer , as in the case of spheres , and hence stackings of the layers can not result in packings with densities that are higher than that of the optimal lattice packing .",
    "if degenerate optimal packings exist , they can not be of the  barlow \" type ."

    "<S> this novel optimization problem is solved here ( using a variety of multi - particle initial configurations ) to find the dense packings of each of the platonic solids in three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath0 , except for the cube , which is the only platonic solid that tiles space . </S>",
    "<S> we find the densest known packings of tetrahedra , icosahedra , dodecahedra , and octahedra with densities @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that the densest tetrahedral packing possesses _ no long - range order_. unlike the densest tetrahedral packing , which must not be a bravais lattice packing , the densest packings of the other non - tiling platonic solids that we obtain are their previously known optimal ( bravais ) lattice packings . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive a simple upper bound on the maximal density of packings of congruent nonspherical particles , and apply it to platonic solids , archimedean solids , superballs and ellipsoids . </S>",
    "<S> provided that what we term the  asphericity \" ( ratio of the circumradius to inradius ) is sufficiently small , the upper bounds are relatively tight and thus close to the corresponding densities of the optimal lattice packings of the centrally symmetric platonic and archimedean solids . </S>",
    "<S> our simulation results , rigorous upper bounds , and other theoretical arguments lead us to the conjecture that the densest packings of platonic and archimedean solids with central symmetry are given by their corresponding densest lattice packings . </S>",
    "<S> this can be regarded to be the analog of kepler s sphere conjecture for these solids . </S>",
    "<S> the truncated tetrahedron is the only non - centrally symmetric archimedean solid , the densest known packing of which is a non - lattice packing with density at least as high as @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the validity of our conjecture to packings of superballs , prisms and anti - prisms as well as to high - dimensional analogs of the platonic solids . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we conjecture that the optimal packing of any convex , congruent polyhedron without central symmetry generally is not a lattice packing . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the possible applications and generalizations of the asc scheme in the predicting the crystal structures of polyhedral nanoparticles and the study of random packings of hard polyhedra . </S>"
