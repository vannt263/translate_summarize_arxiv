    "the earth is embedded in the extended solar atmosphere we call the solar wind .",
    "such winds are known to emanate from other low - mass and sun - like stars , including young solar analogues .",
    "very little is currently known about how these winds influence the atmospheres of young habitable planets , largely because such winds are well constrained by neither observations nor theory .",
    "the first physical model for the solar wind was developed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* parker ( 1958 ) ) , who modelled the solar wind as a simple 1d isothermal pressure driven wind .",
    "later models of the solar wind produced used a polytropic equation of state , where the thermal pressure is given by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the polytropic index ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* totten et al . 1995 ) ) . when @xmath2 , these models implicitly heat the winds as they expand , but do not contain any description of the physics responsible for this heating .",
    "despite a huge amount of progress observationally and theoretically , the fundamental mechanisms that drive the solar wind have not yet been determined .",
    "although there have not been any direct detections of winds from low - mass or sun - like stars , there are indirect methods of measuring these winds , most notably using measurements of ly@xmath3 absorption ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* wood 2004 ) ) . attempts to directly detect thermal bremsstrahlung radiation in radio from these winds have so far led to non - detections ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gaidos 2000 ) ) , putting important upper limits on the wind strengths . as part of the project pathways to habitability , we attempt to detect the radio emission from these winds using vlt and alma observations .",
    "we attempt to constrain the properties of stellar winds using magnetohydrodynamical modelling ( e.g. see fig .",
    "1 ) . we implicitly heat the winds by assuming a polytropic equation of state , as described above .",
    "similar models have been used successfully in previous studies ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* keppens & goedbloed 1999 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* matt & pudritz 2008 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* vidotto et al . 2009 ) ) .",
    "such models contain several free parameters , including the temperature and density at the base of the wind , and the polytropic index , @xmath1 .",
    "unfortunately , the free parameters are not well constrained and the results of these models ( e.g. wind speeds and mass loss rates ) are highly sensitive to these free parameters .",
    "based on the zeeman doppler imaging ( zdi ) technique and the inversion of high - quality stokes polarization data , we study the origin , strength , and distribution of magnetic fields on young active stars , including t tauri stars , as a function of age , mass and spectral type . for modelling , we use a state - of - the - art zdi code from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* piskunov & kochukhov ( 2002 ) ) , which has been extended for self - consistent temperature and magnetic mapping of cool active stars ( ( * ? ? ? * kochukhov & piskunov 2009 ) ) including treatment of molecular opacities . to obtain complete sets of circular and , for stars bright enough , linear stokes parameter observations ,",
    "we have applied and will apply for first - class spectropolarimetric data obtained with frontier instrumentation such as harpspol on the eso 3.6 m telescope , espadons@cfht ( hawaii ) , and narval@tbl ( france ) ."
