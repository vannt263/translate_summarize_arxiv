    "our hybrid dft calculations including soc were performed using the vienna @xmath12 @xmath13 simulation package ( vasp ) with the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method  @xcite . for the exchange - correlation energy , we employed the hse functional  @xcite , which is given by @xmath18 here , the mixing factor @xmath19 controls the amount of exact fock exchange energy and the screening parameter @xmath20 (= 0.20 @xmath21 ) defines the separation of short range ( sr ) and long range ( lr ) for the exchange energy . note",
    "that the hse functional with @xmath19 = 0 becomes identical to the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe )  @xcite functional .",
    "we used the experimental lattice constants @xmath22 = 5.427 , @xmath23 = 9.395 , and @xmath24 = 5.614  with the @xmath25 monoclinic crystal structure , obtained by an xrd study  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath26-space integration was done with the 6@xmath273@xmath276 uniform meshes in the brillouin zone .",
    "all atoms were allowed to relax along the calculated forces until all the residual force components were less than 0.02 ev /  .",
    "we begin to study the experimentally observed  @xcite zigzag afm ground state of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 using the pbe calculation .",
    "the optimized structural parameters such as the ir - ir bond lengths [ @xmath28 and @xmath29 in fig .",
    "1(b ) ] and the ir - o - ir bond angles [ @xmath30 and @xmath31 in fig .",
    "1(b ) ] are given in table i. the calculated values of @xmath30 = 99.84@xmath32 and @xmath31 = 98.51@xmath32 ( greater than the ideal 90@xmath32 ir - o - ir bond angle ) show a sizable trigonal distortion of the iro@xmath33 octahedra , consistent with an xrd analysis  @xcite .",
    "figure 2(a ) shows the calculated band structure and density of states ( dos ) of the zigzag afm structure , which exhibit the presence of partially occupied ir @xmath10 states at the fermi level ( @xmath34 ) , indicating a metallic feature .",
    "note that there are twelve @xmath10 bands which originate from four different ir atoms within the unit cell of the zigzag afm structure .",
    "it is noticeable that , for the @xmath10 states locating near @xmath35 , the partial dos projected onto the o 2@xmath3 orbitals amounts to @xmath1450% of that projected onto the ir 5@xmath2 orbitals [ see fig .",
    "2(a ) ] , indicating a considerable hybridization between the two orbitals . indeed , the spin characters of the @xmath10 state at @xmath35 , as shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) , reveal the electron delocalization over iro@xmath33 octahedra on each zigzag chain side .",
    "these aspects of the @xmath10 states lead not only to a smaller magnetic moment of @xmath140.53 @xmath17 for an ir atom compared to the effective spin @xmath15 = 1/2 moment assumed in the kitaev - heisenberg model  @xcite but also a slightly induced magnetic moment of @xmath140.10 @xmath17 for the o@xmath36 atom [ see fig . 2(b ) and table ii ] .",
    "it is noteworthy that the pbe calculation may involve the over - delocalization of the @xmath10 states due to the sie , therefore incorrectly predicting the zigzag afm structure to be metallic rather than insulating .    in order to correct the sie",
    ", we use the hse functional to optimize the zigzag afm structure .",
    "we find that the structural parameters slightly depend on the magnitude of @xmath19 in the hse functional ( see table i ) : i.e. , @xmath28 and @xmath29 change little by less than 0.01  in the range of 0 @xmath37 @xmath19 @xmath38 0.08 , but , as @xmath19 increases to 0.1 , @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) decreases ( increases ) by @xmath140.02 ( 0.04 )  . we also find a drastic variation of the band structure and dos as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "especially , the dos at @xmath35 is found to decrease as @xmath19 increases up to 0.08 , giving rise to the creation of a pseudogap . for @xmath19 @xmath39 0.08 ,",
    "the pseudogap is turned into an insulating gap whose magnitude increases with increasing @xmath19 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . figure 4(a ) shows the band structure and dos of the zigzag afm structure , obtained using the hse calculation with @xmath19 = 0.05 .",
    "it is seen that , compared with the pbe result [ fig .",
    "2(a ) ] , ( i ) the dos for the occupied @xmath10 states is shifted to a lower energy and ( ii ) the dos at @xmath35 is much reduced .",
    "we note that , as @xmath19 increases , the ir magnetic moment increases compared to that obtained using the pbe calculation ( see table ii ) , reflecting that the hse functional corrects the over - delocalization of ir 5@xmath2 electrons due to the sie of the pbe functional .    according to the @xmath11 scenario ,",
    "the soc splits the @xmath10 states into the @xmath11 = 1/2 and @xmath11 = 3/2 states  @xcite , and the experimental 0.34 ev - gap was opened by taking into account an on - site interaction @xmath4 of 1@xmath403 ev , leading to a conclusion that the insulating phase of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 can be represented as a spin - orbit mott insulator  @xcite . in this study",
    ", we examine the effect of soc on the electronic structure of the zigzag afm structure using the hse+soc calculation . here , we employ the optimized hse structure because the effect of soc changes little the ir - ir bond lengths and the ir - o - ir bond angles by less that 0.01  and 1@xmath32 , respectively . as shown in fig .",
    "3 , the inclusion of soc opens the band gap @xmath41 , which monotonically increases with increasing @xmath19 . for @xmath19 = 0 ( equivalent to the pbe+soc calculation ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath41 = 0.05 ev , in good agreement with a previous pbe+soc calculation  @xcite . on the other hand , as @xmath19 increases to 0.05 ,",
    "@xmath41 becomes 0.33 ev , close to the experimental value of @xmath140.34 ev  @xcite .",
    "the hse+soc band structure and dos computed with @xmath19 = 0.05 are displayed in fig .",
    "it is seen that ( i ) the @xmath10 bands just below and above @xmath35 become almost dispersionless , thereby possibly correcting the over - delocalization of the @xmath10 states , and ( ii ) there are six separated energy regions for the @xmath10 bands , consistent with the experimental observation of the five @xmath2-@xmath2 interband transitions in optical conductivity  @xcite . since the hse+soc calculation with @xmath19 = 0.05 adequately predicts the insulating electronic structure of the zigzag afm ground state , we can say that the insulating phase of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 can be represented as a spin - orbit slater insulator through itinerant magnetism .",
    "we note that the optimal hse+soc value of @xmath19 = 0.05 reproducing the experimental 0.34 ev - gap  @xcite is smaller than that ( @xmath19 @xmath42 0.15 ) obtained from the hse calculation ( see fig .",
    "this indicates that the hse calculation needs larger @xmath19 to cure over - delocalization of the @xmath10 states due to relatively larger sie .",
    "figure 4(c ) shows the magnetic moment ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) for each atom of the zigzag afm structure , obtained using the hse+soc calculation with @xmath19 = 0.05 .",
    "we find that ir , o@xmath36 , and o@xmath0 atoms have the three components of magnetic moment ( @xmath460.12 , 0.00 , @xmath460.36 ) , ( @xmath460.02 , @xmath460.02 , @xmath460.06 ) or ( @xmath460.02 , @xmath470.02 , @xmath460.06 ) , and ( 0.00 , @xmath460.05 , 0.00 ) in units of @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "it is notable that , when compared with the hse calculation with the same @xmath19 = 0.05 , the inclusion of soc reduces the magnitude @xmath16 = @xmath48 for ir ( o@xmath36 ) atom by @xmath1434(46 ) @xmath49 but creates @xmath44 = @xmath460.05 @xmath17 for o@xmath0 atom [ see table ii and fig .",
    "4(c ) ] . thus , the hse+soc value of @xmath16 = 0.37 @xmath17 for ir atom is closer to that ( @xmath140.22 @xmath17 ) measured by a combined neutron and xrd experiment  @xcite .",
    "these theoretical and experimental evidences for a strong suppression of the ir magnetic moment support a slater - type insulator via itinerant magnetism rather than localized magnetism proposed by the kitaev - heisenberg model with effective @xmath15 = 1/2 pseudospins  @xcite .",
    "we note that the hse calculations for half - filled systems  @xcite have highly debated about the distinction between a mott - type insulator and a slater - type insulator .",
    "for instance , the hse calculation for the cs@xmath1c@xmath50 crystal predicted  @xcite not only a highly localized half - filled state but also a magnetic moment of @xmath141 @xmath17 corresponding to a @xmath15 = 1/2 state , thereby being characterized as a mott - type insulator . on the other hand , the hse calculation for the sn / ge(111 ) surface predicted  @xcite a rather delocalized half - filled state with a much reduced magnetic moment of @xmath140.2 @xmath17 , suggesting a slater - type insulator .",
    "it was experimentally observed that the paramagnetic insulating phase  @xcite of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 exists between @xmath7 @xmath8 15 k and room temperature  @xcite .",
    "however , the precise nature of the paramagnetic insulating phase above @xmath7 is still open to question . the experimental evidence that @xmath7 is much smaller than the weiss temperature  @xcite ( @xmath42 @xmath40120 k ) may indicate a frustration of the underlying afm interactions .",
    "we note that the stripy and n@xmath6el afm structures [ see fig .",
    "1(c ) ] can be feasible to model the paramagnetic phase because these afm structures and the paramagnetic phase have the common features such as similar ir magnetic moments and zero net magnetic moments in their unit cells . for the stripy and n@xmath6el afm structures , we perform the hse+soc calculations with @xmath19 = 0.05 .",
    "the stripy ( n@xmath6el ) afm structure is found to be not only less stable than the zigzag afm structure by 4.0 ( 12.5 ) mev per ir atom , but also insulating with @xmath51 = 0.18 ( 0.30 ) ev .",
    "however , we were not able to obtain the nonmagnetic structure which was always converged to the n@xmath6el afm structure . since the energy differences among the zigzag , stripy , and n@xmath6el afm structures are very small , not only is @xmath7 much lower compared to the cases of other iridates but quantum fluctuations of such afm structures are also likely present above @xmath7 , leading to an effectively paramagnetic phase .",
    "further experimental and theoretical studies for the paramagnetic insulating phase are demanded to resolve its nature .",
    "we performed the hse+soc calculation to investigate the zigzag afm ground state of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 .",
    "we found that the observed insulating gap of @xmath140.34 ev  @xcite is well predicted by not only taking into account the soc but also correcting the sie inherent in the lda or the gga .",
    "thus , our results indicate a significant slater - type character of gap formation through itinerant magnetism . as a matter of fact",
    ", we predicted a small itinerant magnetic moment of 0.37 @xmath17 per ir atom , contrasting with a fully localized magnetic moment of 1 @xmath17 per ir atom presumed within the kitaev - heisenberg model  @xcite .",
    "similar to the present case of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 , we anticipate that the correction of sie would be of importance to describe the insulating phases of other ir oxides .",
    "we note that other 5@xmath2 tmo such as sr@xmath0iro@xmath52  @xcite and naoso@xmath1  @xcite were recently reported to display a magnetically driven gap formation , supporting a slater - type insulator .",

    "<S> this separation between the insulating behavior and the onset of afm ordering may imply that na@xmath0iro@xmath1 can be regarded as a mott insulator driven by electron correlations  @xcite . to address the nature of the insulating phase in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , it was suggested that the ir@xmath9 @xmath10 states locating around the fermi energy would be treated in terms of relativistic atomic orbitals with the effective angular momentum @xmath11 = 1/2 and @xmath11 = 3/2  @xcite . here , the upper @xmath11 = 1/2 band decoupled from the lower @xmath11 = 3/2 bands was presumed to be half - filled , and therefore ir atoms can have localized magnetic moments corresponding to an effective spin one - half ir@xmath9 ion  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this @xmath11 scenario caused by strong soc leads not only to a novel magnetic structure suggested from the kitaev - heisenberg model  @xcite but also a spin - orbit mott insulator where the half - filled @xmath11 = 1/2 band splits into two hubbard bands by taking into account on - site hubbard @xmath4  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , contrasting with such highly localized @xmath11 = 1/2 orbitals at ir atoms , a recent @xmath12 @xmath13 density functional theory ( dft ) calculation together with the tight - binding model analysis  @xcite showed that the @xmath10 bands can be described by quasimolecular orbitals ( qmos ) which are fully delocalized over six ir atoms forming a honeycomb lattice . despite this rather itinerant character of qmos </S>",
    "<S> , the explicit treatment of @xmath4 was required to obtain the observed insulating gap of @xmath140.34 ev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus likely that the effect of electron correlations plays an indispensable role in describing the insulating phase of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 , thereby being represented as a mott insulator  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> this magnetically driven insulating phase through an itinerant single - particle approach can be represented as a slater insulator  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is noticeable that a rather delocalized character of the ir @xmath10 states , as described by qmos  @xcite , may be associated with the self - interaction error ( sie ) inherent to the conventional dft calculations with the local density approximation ( lda )  @xcite or the generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the sie causes the electron density to artificially spread out because delocalization reduces the spurious self - repulsion of electron  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this so - called delocalization error tends to give an inaccurate estimation of the ionization energy and the electron affinity , resulting in the underestimation of band gap  @xcite . in this </S>",
    "<S> regard , previous lda and gga calculations  @xcite may not adequately describe the insulating phase of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is very challenging to examine how the electronic properties of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 can be changed by the correction of sie with an exchange - correlation functional beyond the lda or gga .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we present a new theoretical study of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 based on the hybrid dft scheme including soc . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the effect of soc and the correction of sie with the screened hybrid exchange - correlation functional of heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof ( hse )  @xcite opens the observed  @xcite insulating gap of @xmath140.34 ev for the zigzag afm ground state . compared with the effective spin @xmath15 = 1/2 moments ( </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 = 1 @xmath17 ) within the kitaev - heisenberg model  @xcite , the calculated magnetic moment per ir atom is much reduced to be 0.37 @xmath17 , close to that ( @xmath140.22 @xmath17 ) measured by a combined neutron and x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) experiment  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such an itinerant character of magnetism is revealed to be due to a considerable hybridization of the ir 5@xmath2 orbitals with the o 2@xmath3 orbitals . </S>"
