    "observational determinations of the history of star formation in early - type galaxies ( hereafter etgs ) are of great importance because hierarchical models of galaxy formation make firm predictions for the relation between age , metallicity and @xmath0-enhancement as a function of mass .",
    "these scaling relations , plotted against the observational proxy for mass , the velocity dispersion ( hereafter @xmath4 ) , have been the focus of many recent studies of etgs ( annibali et al .",

    "these studies clearly show that the simple picture of early formation of low mass galaxies , which then merge to form more massive systems is incorrect .",
    "the oldest stellar populations are found in the most massive galaxies ",
    "one aspect of so - called `` downsizing '' .",
    "however , the observational constraint is sensitive to the epoch at which star formation ceased , not when it started , so that low mass etgs can still be `` old '' , as dynamically bound objects , but have a _",
    "mean _ stellar age that is much younger .",
    "however , this is not sufficient to save the simple hierarchical picture because the @xmath0-enhancement is also seen to increase with mass - implying more rapid formation for massive objects .",
    "this is a prediction of monolithic collapse models .",
    "it is important to remember that both the star formation history and mass assembly history of etgs determine their evolution .",
    "the most common method of determining the age , metallicity and @xmath0-enhancement of etgs is by comparison of the narrow band absorption line indices with simple stellar population ( ssp ) models .",
    "it is well - known that stellar population parameters based on these indices are also sensitive to minor episodes of recent star formation .",
    "luminosity - weighted , ssp equivalent stellar population parameters , such as those discussed here , do not therefore , distinguish between a genuinely young galaxy and an old galaxy that has experienced a `` rejuvenation '' event",
    ".    some recent studies , based on the colour - magnitude relation of etgs using colours that are extremely sensitive to recent star formation , in fact paint a surprising picture of etg evolution .",
    "schawinski et al . (",
    "2007 ) have used galex ultraviolet imaging to show that 30% of massive etgs show _ ongoing _ star formation and that this fraction is higher in low - density environments .",
    "a similar picture is given by mid - infrared spitzer data .",
    "both clemens et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and bressan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) find that @xmath5 of etgs in the coma and virgo clusters have experienced some star formation in the recent past .",
    "a recent study by rogers et al . ( 2007 ) has combined sdss spectra and galex data to conclude that `` weak episodes of recent star formation '' are a phenomenon more commonly associated with etgs in the _ cluster _",
    "environment , a result seemingly , but not necessarily , inconsistent with several studies that find older ssp - equivalent ages in denser environments .",
    "here we repeat the analysis carried out in clemens et al .",
    "( 2006 , hereafter paper  i ) , which used 3614 objects selected from data release 3 ( dr3 ) of the sdss . applying the same selection criteria to dr6 we define a sample of 14353 etgs , four times as many objects .",
    "sample selection is identical to that described in paper  i. the local environmental density is defined as the inverse of the distance to the fifth nearest neighbour , @xmath6 , corrected for the redshift dependent effect of survey boundaries .",
    "we measure the 21 line - strength indices of the original lick - ids system plus the additional indices h@xmath7f , h@xmath8f , b4000 and hk .",
    "however , before measuring the narrow - band indices from each of the sdss , spectra we smooth the spectra to the wavelength dependent resolution of the lick - ids spectra .",
    "this step is essential as the models that we use to derive the age , metallicity and @xmath0enhancement are based on the lick system .",
    "the index values are then corrected for the smoothing effects of the galaxy s velocity dispersion and aperture corrected to a standard normalized radius ( a fraction of the half - light radius ) .",
    "see paper  i for a more detailed description .    besides being based on dr6 , the present work differs from that of paper  i only in 2 respects .",
    "firstly , in paper  i we chose to correct for the fixed angular diameter of @xmath9 sampled by the sdss fibre using the radial index measurements of 50 nearby e and s0 galaxies ( rampazzo et al . 2005 ) . here , we make use of the r - band effective radii provided in the sdss catalogue to derive the aperture correction directly . statistically , a more reliable correction should be obtained in this way . however",
    ", this also means that we must choose a larger standard radius to which to correct ( @xmath10/10 was used in paper  i ) .",
    "typically , the @xmath9 diameter sdss fibre samples @xmath11 , with very few objects being so large that the fibre samples @xmath12 . to avoid",
    "extrapolating beyond measured radii we therefore aperture correct to a standard radius of either @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "a plot of index value versus the fraction of @xmath10 sampled by the fibre will show a gradient .",
    "however , the gradient is due not only to the radial gradients within each galaxy but also to the correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath4 .",
    "because index values are correlated with @xmath4 this effect increases the magnitude of the gradient . to determine the aperture effect we therefore consider the variation of index value as a function of the fraction of @xmath10 sampled by the fibre in restricted bins of @xmath4 . in this way",
    "we minimize the effect of the index-@xmath4 relations and determine the radial index gradients as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "we plot index values as a function of @xmath15 in 5 bins , for 8 separate bins of @xmath4 .",
    "the bins are chosen to maintain a large number of objects in each bin and gradients are then derived by weighting each point by @xmath16 where n is the number in the bin .",
    "the values of the radial index gradients and their variation with @xmath4 are shown in table  [ tab : radgrad ] .",
    "we use the radial index gradients to correct our index values for aperture effects .",
    "firstly , we use the measured value of @xmath4 for a given galaxy to determine the value of the radial index gradient @xmath17 :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the velocity dispersion in units of @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the value of the index gradient for @xmath22 .",
    "values for @xmath23 and @xmath21 are given in table  [ tab : radgrad ] .",
    "this value of the radial index gradient is then used with the measured value of @xmath10 of the galaxy to correct the index value to the equivalent radius , @xmath24 or @xmath25 :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the corrected index , @xmath28 is the measured index value , @xmath10 is the effective radius of the galaxy in arcsec and @xmath29 is the standard radius expressed as a fraction of @xmath10 ( 0.5 or 0.25 here ) .",
    "the use the the effective radii provided in sdss ( the petrosian half - light radius ) to effect the aperture correction has one caveat .",
    "that is , that these radii are not seeing corrected .",
    "therefore for galaxies with a small angular diameter @xmath10 is over - estimated .",
    "median r - band seeing for sdss imaging is @xmath30 ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2007 , fig .  4 ) and the median effective diameter for our sample is @xmath31 .",
    "we believe , however , that this is not a serious problem because the seeing also alters the light entering the spectroscopic fibre .",
    "the considerable agreement we find in values for the indices as a function of @xmath4 with other studies ( see below ) reinforces this view .",
    "the second difference from paper  1 is the removal of one index , g4300 , from the fitting procedure used to derive the age , metallicity and @xmath0enhancement as a function of @xmath4 and environment .",
    "this was done because the index seems less well modeled than previously thought .",
    "here we will use the index values to derive various evolutionary parameters as a function of @xmath4 , environment and galaxy radius . before that , however , we briefly evaluate various trends seen in the fully @xmath4 and aperture corrected index values .      in table  [ tab : grad ] we show the corrected index values as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "because the values refer to indices aperture corrected to @xmath13 , they are not directly comparable to those of paper  i , where corrections were made to @xmath12 . nonetheless , most indices show similar behaviour to those of paper  i. we briefly note here some of the larger differences seen in important indices ( we refer to gradients expressed as @xmath32 as @xmath33 and those as @xmath34 as @xmath35 ) .    * c4668 * : the gradient of @xmath36 much larger than that of paper  i ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "this value is closer to the value of @xmath38 found by nelan et al .",
    "( 2005 , hereafter n05 ) . * h@xmath39 * : the gradient of @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) is shallower ( @xmath42 in paper  i ) .",
    "this value is in excellent agreement with bernardi et al .",
    "( 2003 , hereafter b03 ) ( @xmath41 ) and n05 ( @xmath43 ) . * fe5015 * : the gradient of @xmath44 in paper  i contrasts to the present value of @xmath45 .",
    "this is much more consistent with n05 who find @xmath46 . *",
    "mg2 * : the value of @xmath47 is similar to that of paper  i , but is now more consistent with both b03 and kuntschner et al .",
    "* mgb * : the gradient of @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) compares with 3.7 in paper  i. this is closer to that of b03 ( @xmath50 ) and n05 ( @xmath51 ) . * fe5270 * : in paper  i a null gradient was found . the present value of @xmath52 is consistent with n05 who find an identical value .",
    "we note , that globally , the new index gradients are much closer to those derived by n05 despite the fact that these authors aperture corrected index values to a fixed physical radius , rather than to a fixed fraction of @xmath10 as done here .",
    "the spatial gradients we measure here describe the _",
    "mean index value in apertures of varying radii _",
    ", at fixed @xmath4 .",
    "this is in contrast with ` true ' spatial index gradients , which are measured in increasing annuli projected on the galaxy . as a result , the values we measure are smaller in magnitude than the true gradients .",
    "our values , which we give in table  [ tab : radgrad ] , are , however , directly applicable to aperture correction .",
    "all the narrow line indices , with the exception of hk , show a radial gradient .",
    "the gradients are negative except for the hydrogen line indices and the @xmath53 break , b4000 .",
    "additionally , some indices show a well defined trend of index gradient with @xmath4 ( these can be quickly identified in the last column of table  [ tab : radgrad ] ) . in all cases",
    "( except cn1 and cn2 ) the sense of this variation is that the index gradient becomes less steep with increasing @xmath4 . in some cases , including @xmath54 , a significant index gradient at low values of @xmath4 disappears completely for @xmath55 .",
    "we find no dependence on the radial index gradients with density of environment at fixed @xmath4 .",
    "the fact that some indices show gradients which decrease with increasing @xmath4 does not necessarily imply that some process has acted to mix the stellar populations in more massive systems .",
    "we return to this below .",
    ".radial index gradients as a function of velocity dispersion , @xmath4 .",
    "the radial index gradients are expressed as , @xmath56 , where @xmath28 is the value of the index .",
    "the third column gives values for the dependence of the radial index gradients on @xmath4 in units of @xmath20 , @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath21 is the value of the index gradient at @xmath57 .",
    "these parameters have been used in the aperture correction of all indices .",
    "most indices show a well - defined radial gradient , but rather few show a convincing trend of this gradient on @xmath4 .",
    "the last column shows the ratio of the gradient in the third column and its error and so is an estimate of the statistical significance of the gradient as a function of @xmath4 . for those indices",
    "whose radial gradients show little trend with @xmath4 , the value of @xmath21 is a good measure of the radial gradient for galaxies of any @xmath4 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,>,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we now make use of the index values to derive the age , metallicity and @xmath0- enhancement of the galaxy population in our sample .",
    "we repeat the multiple linear regression procedure described in paper  i ( to which the reader is referred for a detailed description ) .",
    "we briefly summarize the procedure here .",
    "firstly , because our index values are not calibrated to the lick system ( due to the lack of lick standard star spectra in sdss ) we consider index variations relative to the mean value at a @xmath4 of @xmath57 . by working with these differential index values",
    "we avoid both the problem of absolute calibration to the lick system and potential problems in the absolute calibration of the ssp models .",
    "we therefore perform a multiple linear regression according to equation 5 of paper  i. the linear regression is performed on the whole sample and on 2 subsets of environmental density , @xmath58 ( typical of the field ) and @xmath59 ( more typical of a cluster ) .",
    "we also perform the analysis on indices aperture corrected to 2 different radii , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , to investigate radial trends within the individual galaxies .",
    "the results of this regression analysis showed that the carbon abundance did not depend on @xmath4 , having a constant offset as a function of environment , in contrast to paper   i. this difference is probably due to the better aperture correction used here and/or the exclusion of the g4300 index .",
    "we therefore remove the explicit carbon abundance from the regression analysis , allowing the carbon abundance to be included in the metallicity term .",
    "the _ simultaneous a posteriori fit _ of the model to three example indices is compared with the median of the data in the different bins of @xmath4 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : model_fits ] .    in the left panel of figure  [ fig : results ]",
    "we show the results for the entire sample for two different radii .",
    "for @xmath14 the trend of age with @xmath4 is very similar to that seen in paper  i with a steady rise in age from the lowest mass systems and an approximately constant age for galaxies with @xmath60 . for the larger aperture , however , the trend is slightly different , with a less pronounced flattening towards high values of @xmath4 .",
    "for @xmath61 the mean age is @xmath62  dex older for @xmath13 compared to @xmath14 .",
    "this corresponds to an age difference of @xmath63 for a galaxy of age @xmath64 .",

    "we derive an age gradient in massive galaxies _ despite the absence of a gradient of the h@xmath39 index_.    the increase of metallicity with @xmath4 is less strong than that found in paper  i. the gradient for the indices , corrected to @xmath14 , for @xmath66 is @xmath67 .",

    "we find a marginally significant trend towards higher metallicities in low density environments but the environment has no effect on the @xmath0-enhancement .",
    "apart from the marginal metallicity difference between field and cluster the results are very similar to those of paper  i. there we concluded that an anti - hierarchical scenario , in which star formation lasts longer but with lower efficiency in lower mass objects ( see granato et al .",
    "2004 ) was consistent with the data . here",
    "the additional determination of ssp parameters as a function of galactic radius places additional constraints on the evolutionary scenario .",
    "massive etgs ( @xmath65 ) have positive radial age gradients , negative metallicity gradients and marginally significant negative @xmath0-enhancement gradients . when a massive halo becomes non - linear it accretes smaller halos which started to collapse at earlier times .",
    "the radial trends suggest that these halos do not contain only gas , but also pristine stars .",
    "the gaseous component falls dissipatively into the potential well of the massive ( proto-)spheroid , fueling rapid star formation .",
    "the increase in mass increases the rate and efficiency of star formation , driving the main correlations with galaxy mass .",
    "the pristine stellar component of each sub - halo , however , being dissipationless , is deposited at a radius consistent with the angular momentum of the encounter .",
    "these stars , which are slightly older , more metal poor and have moderate @xmath0-enhancement will therefore be spread over larger radii . at early times , rapid gas - rich mergers lead to an almost monolithic formation , at later times mergers become increasingly `` dry '' .",
    "very similar scenarios have been proposed to explain both the bi- modal metallicity distribution of globular clusters and the greater radial scale length of metal - poor relative to metal - rich globular clusters in elliptical galaxies ( ct , marzke & west , 1998 , bekki et al .",
    "our results imply that the metal - poor globular cluster population in etgs should be older , less metal - rich and slightly less @xmath0-enhanced than the metal - rich clusters .",
    "because the age difference at larger radii is actually the luminosity weighted ssp equivalent age in a larger aperture ( not an annulus ) , the value of 0.05 dex , @xmath63 , is a lower limit to the real age difference at larger radii .",
    "this time difference limits the assembly redshift of massive etgs simply due to the lack of time to accommodate the formation of stars in the lower mass halos .",
    "our limit translates into an upper limit to the assembly redshift of massive etgs of @xmath3 ; in which case the stars in low mass halos formed at @xmath77 , for a standard cosmology ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) .",
    "this also provides an estimate of the star formation rate in the assembled spheroid .",
    "if the final stellar mass were @xmath81 then stars must have formed at a rate @xmath82 .",
    "we conclude by stressing the statistical nature of our results .",
    "because a galaxy s velocity dispersion is a function of both the halo mass and virialization redshift , variations in these parameters may render small samples insensitive to the trends we find .",

    "<S> we define a volume limited sample of over 14,000 early - type galaxies ( etgs ) selected from data release six of the sloan digital sky survey . </S>",
    "<S> the density of environment of each galaxy is robustly measured . by comparing narrow band spectral line indices with recent models of simple stellar populations ( ssps ) we investigate trends in the star formation history as a function of galaxy mass ( velocity dispersion ) , density of environment and galactic radius . </S>",
    "<S> we find that age , metallicity and @xmath0-enhancement all increase with galaxy mass and that field etgs are younger than their cluster counterparts by @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find negative radial metallicity gradients for all masses and environments , and positive radial age gradients for etgs with velocity dispersion over @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> our results are qualitatively consistent with a relatively simple picture for etg evolution in which the low - mass halos accreted by a proto - etg contained not only gas but also a stellar population . </S>",
    "<S> this fossil population is preferentially found at large radii in massive etgs because the stellar accretions were dissipationless . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that the typical , massive etg should have been assembled at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the process is similar in the cluster and the field but occurred earlier in dense environments .    </S>",
