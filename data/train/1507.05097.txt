    "the _ kepler _  mission is a nasa discovery program mission designed to characterise the population of planetary systems using high precision photometric observations .",
    "the primary goal of the _ kepler _  mission is to measure @xmath3 , the frequency of earth - size planets in the habitable zone of sun - like stars .",
    "the spacecraft was launched in 2009 , and for four years monitored the brightness of @xmath0192,000 stars nearly continuously , looking for the periodic dimmings indicative of transiting planets .",
    "the _ kepler _  project has produced several planet candidate catalogues ( borucki et al .",

    "2014 ; rowe et al 2015 ; mullally et al .",
    "2015 ) from these data .    in order to determine the real , underlying population of planets from a sample of planet candidates ,",
    "an essential step is to quantify the false negative rate : the fraction of the real planets that should have been detected that are not included in the sample ( also called the survey completeness or survey detection efficiency ) .",
    "initial analyses of the published _",
    "kepler _  planet candidate catalogues , e.g. borucki et al .",
    "( 2011b ; referred to as b11 for the remainder of this paper ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite used various estimates of detection efficiency to constrain the occurrence rate of planets , but as yet there is no definitive empirical measure of this value for the _ kepler _  pipeline .",
    "petigura , howard & marcy ( 2013 ; referred to as phm13 for the remainder of this paper ) used a custom - built pipeline to produce their own planet candidate sample from the _ kepler _  data , which allowed them to directly quantify their detection efficiency and remove the uncertainties caused by estimating this quantity .",
    "we have initiated a large , robust study to empirically measure the false negative rate in the _ kepler _  planet candidate sample , first introduced in @xcite , hereafter referred to as paper i. in that study , we investigated the ability of the pipeline to preserve individual transit events , finding an extremely high fidelity of 99.7% recovery of the expected signal strength across most of the investigated parameter space .",
    "this is extremely valuable for people performing their own transit searches using the _ kepler _  light curves , as they can be assured that there has been little to no corruption of the signals at that point ( barring the transits of very short period planets with periods below three days , or transits falling within two days of a gap in the _ kepler _  data , as demonstrated in paper i ) .",
    "the next step is to investigate the ability of the pipeline to recover periodic transit signals , as compared to individual transit signals .",
    "here we present the results of our measurement of the detection efficiency of the _ kepler _  pipeline across one year of long - cadence ( 30-minute integration ) observations , comprising q9q12 ( for a detailed review of the _ kepler _  mission design , performance and data products , see koch et al .",

    "2010a ) . to measure the detection efficiency , we injected the signatures of simulated transiting planets into the calibrated pixels of @xmath026,000 target stars across the focal plane , processed the pixels through the data reduction and planet search pipeline as normal , and examined the resulting detections . in section",
    "[ sec : design ] , we describe in detail the configuration of the tested pipeline and the generation and injection of the simulated planet signals . in section [ sec : results ] we examine the characteristics of the detections and generate the pipeline s sensitivity curve . in section",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we explore the impact of the sensitivity curve on the derived underlying planet population , in order to understand the systematic biases in the derived occurrence rates caused by assumptions about the pipeline sensitivity . finally in section",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we summarise the results and outline the further work required .",
    "the data reduction pipeline has been described in detail in a series of papers ; for an overview see @xcite and figure 1 therein .",
    "the performance of the ` front end ' of the pipeline , comprising the modules calibration ( cal : calibration of raw pixels ; quintana et al .",
    "2010 ) , photometric analysis ( pa : construction of the initial flux time series from the optimal aperture for each target ; twicken et al .",
    "2010 ) , and pre - search data conditioning ( pdc : removal of common systematic signals from the flux time series ; smith et al .",
    "2012 , stumpe et al .",
    "2012 , stumpe et al .",
    "2014 ) , in preserving transit signals was examined in paper i. the performance of the full pipeline , including the ` back end ' , comprising the modules transiting planet search ( tps : searching the light curves for periodic transit signals ; jenkins et al .",
    "2010b , seader et al . 2013 ) and data validation ( dv : examination and validation of the resulting candidate signals against a suite of diagnostic tests ; wu et al . 2010 ) , is examined here . in particular , the data products and software versions match those used to produce the q1q16 threshold crossing event ( tce ) catalogue presented in @xcite and the associated q1q16 kepler object of interest ( koi ) catalogue ( mullally et  al .",
    "explicitly , the cal and pa products were from data releases 12 ( 8.0 ) , 13 ( 8.0 ) , 15 ( 8.0 ) and 17 ( 8.1 ) for quarters 9 , 10 , 11 and 12 respectively , where the soc pipeline version is given in brackets after the release number ; the pdc products were from data release 21 ( 8.3 ) ; and the tps and dv products were produced using version 9.1 of the soc pipeline . using the more updated pdc and tps / dv products in both",
    "the generation of the q1q16 catalogue and this transit injection experiment allowed us to take advantage of the intervening updates ( including bayesian analysis to remove common systematic signals across target light curves in pdc and vetoing of non - astrophysical signals and iterative searching in tps ) , without waiting for the long term re - processing of the cal and pa products .",
    "subsequently , updates to cal and pa which have improved the detection efficiency in the meantime are not tested here ; they will however be included in the q1q17 catalogue and corresponding transit injection experiment .",
    "some of the potential areas for signal loss in the pipeline are described in paper i. one of these is signal distortion , by such processes as aperture errors and losses , and sudden pixel sensitivity drop - outs ( spsds ) occurring during transits .",
    "additional causes of signal distortion include pipeline processes , such as the systematic error removal in pdc or the harmonic removal in tps .",
    "another source of signal loss is caused by signal masking : the pipeline now iteratively searches each flux time series down to the 7.1@xmath4 signal detection threshold , removing the observations that contributed to the detected signals before searching again .",
    "this effectively reduces the number of cadences when transits can be observed , and as a consequence , the detectability of additional signals in that time series .    in order to investigate the impacts of signal distortion and signal masking , we performed the following experiment .",
    "we selected 15 sky groups across the _ kepler _  focal plane  a sky group refers to the set of target stars that fall together on the same ccd channel .",
    "as the _ kepler _  spacecraft rotates around its boresight every three months , to keep the solar panels pointed at the sun , the set of stars rotates together onto a different ccd channel , and so on until after four rotations ( one year of observations ) , the set of stars returns to the original ccd channel .",
    "the sky groups were selected to sample a range of the focal plane architecture and ccd channel characteristics in q9 ( in q10q12 , these sky groups will fall on other ccds , typically with ` average ' behaviour ) ; they are listed in table [ tab : ccds ] . for computational reasons",
    "we limit this first multi - quarter transit injection experiment to one year of data comprising q9q12 .",
    "this is the first full year of spacecraft operations without a long data gap due to a spacecraft anomaly , and was chosen to isolate the impact of the data reduction pipeline on the detection efficiency ; the impact of the window function due to long data gaps in the full data set will be investigated more thoroughly in the full baseline ( q1q17 ) transit injection experiment .    across these sky groups ,",
    "we inject simulated transits into every target star .",
    "we generate our injected transits using the @xcite model . for each target star ,",
    "the parameters of an initial estimated transit model are constructed from four observable parameters : ( 1 ) the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of a single transit is randomly drawn from a uniform distribution between 2@xmath4 and 20@xmath4 ; ( 2 ) the transit duration is randomly drawn from a uniform distribution between 1 and 16 hours ( in the pipeline , we search for transit pulses with durations from 1.515 hours ) ; ( 3 ) the impact parameter , @xmath5 , is randomly drawn from a uniform distribution between 01 ; and ( 4 ) the phase of the first injected transit is randomly drawn from a uniform distribution between 01 .",
    "the epoch of the first transit is also required to fall in quarter 9 , to ensure at least one injected transit per star .",
    "we then , using the calculations described in appendix a of paper i , generate a physical transit model which approximately reproduces those initial observed parameters , and from which the actual observed parameters are measured .",
    "we assume circular orbits and no limb darkening when generating the transit signal .",
    "we have included as electronic data both the physical and the measured observable parameters of the final injected planet models .",
    "table [ tab : partablesample ] shows an excerpt from the table to illustrate the contents .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab : intrates ]",
    "we present here the first empirical measurement of the detection efficiency of the _ kepler _  pipeline when detecting periodic transit signals , based on the injection and recovery of simulated transit signals injected into the calibrated pixel data . with a baseline of one year , we find that the measured detection efficiency for fgk dwarfs ( 4000k @xmath6 7000k , log@xmath7 ) is well described by a @xmath8 function with the coefficients @xmath9 , @xmath2",
    ". however , we know from examination of the _ kepler _  pipeline detections for longer baselines ( see , for example , tenenbaum et al . 2013 ) that unexpected behaviour occurs at longer periods than those examined in this study , especially periods 300400 days , due to the annual rotation of the targets around the _ kepler _  field of view . since one of the primary goals for the _ kepler _",
    "mission is the measurement of the occurrence rate of planets in the habitable zone of stars like the sun , and these longer periods encompass that parameter space , it is imperative that we extend the analysis described here to longer baselines .",
    "we plan to run a comparable transit injection experiment for the full _ kepler _  observing baseline ( q1q17 ) and derive the equivalent detection efficiency curve .",
    "one particular area of study will be the detectability of multi - planet systems  the extent to which the presence of multiple periodic signals in the data and the order in which they are detected and removed by the pipeline before subsequent searches impacts the final detection efficiency    another process that needs to be quantified is the examination of the pipeline candidates and subsequent classification as either planet candidates or false positives .",
    "for the early catalogues ( up to the q1q12 catalogue , rowe et al .",
    "2015 ) , this classification was done entirely by a team of humans , evaluating each candidate one by one .",
    "the project is moving towards more automated methods of classification by creating algorithms to automate the decision making process ( mccauliff et al .",
    "2015 , jenkins et al . in prep ) .",
    "the first steps toward a completely automated process were taken in the q16 catalogue ( mullally et  al . 2015 ) .",
    "the final vetting process , whether human- or machine - based , introduces an additional ` detection efficiency ' , whereby some real planet candidates may not be promoted to planet candidate status and be incorrectly classified as false positives . our plan is to use the longer baseline run described above to also quantify the detection efficiency of the post - pipeline analysis , by reproducing the decision - making process as closely as possible , and examining the rate at which our ` real ' planets are discarded .",
    "finally , we also have the capacity to inject the simulated transit signal at a location offset from the target star , allowing us to simulate false positive signals ( i.e. due to eclipsing binaries along the line of sight ) . by allocating some number of targets in the longer baseline experiment to study this",
    ", we will be able to examine the ability of the pipeline centroid analysis to identify and discard these false positives , and to identify the parameter space in which this identification is reliable .",
    "funding for the _ kepler _  discovery mission is provided by nasa s science mission directorate .",
    "the authors acknowledge the efforts of the kepler mission team for obtaining the calibrated pixels , light curves and data validation diagnostics data used in this publication .",
