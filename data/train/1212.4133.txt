    "one of the central problems in material science is to evaluate the effective electric , magnetic , elastic and thermal properties governing the physical behavior of heterogeneous materials.@xcite in recent years , with the progressive miniaturization of structures and devices , possible size effects have attracted an ever increasing interest .",
    "one crucial property that usually drives the scale effects in structured materials is the complexity of interfaces between different phases .",
    "typically , in the macroscopic modeling , the interfaces are assumed to be perfect . in the context of the electrical conduction it means that the potential @xmath0 and the normal component of the current density @xmath1 are continuous across any interface:@xcite @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where the symbol @xmath4 represents the jump of the function @xmath5 across the interface .",
    "this approximation turns out to be valid in the case of small surface / volume ratio .",
    "however , in many real cases of technological interest , e.g. nanocomposites , it is important to take into consideration the specific properties of the contacts among the constituents .",
    "to this aim , two effective interface models have been so far introduced for describing two extreme situations in a zero thickness formulation . moreover ,",
    "other models are based of an explicit interphase of finite thickness and , therefore , they typically consider a three - phase heterogeneous material composed of the inclusions , the interphase medium and the matrix.@xcite         the first zero thickness model is called _ low conducting interface _ and it is based on the kapitza resistance , introduced in the context of the thermal conduction.@xcite according to this approach @xmath3 , while the potential suffers a jump proportional to the local flux , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the kapitza - like resistance . the second model , called _ high conducting interface _ , concerns the case of an interphase of very high conductivity with vanishing thickness .",
    "in this situation @xmath2 , while the normal component of the current density is proportional to the surface laplacian of the potential , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 represents the interphase conductance .",
    "several investigations on heterogeneous materials with low @xcite or high @xcite conducting interfaces can be found in literature .    in many cases ,",
    "the behavior of complex interfaces can not be simply described through the low or high conducting model .",
    "in fact , these schemes account for a single interlayer with an extreme ( high or low ) value of the conductivity , while real interface typically exhibit a complex or multilayered structure . to overcome this difficulty we introduce a generalized anisotropic interface formalism , which consider both the normal resistance ( similarly to the kapitza case ) and the tangential conductance ( as in the high conducting interface model ) .",
    "the term anisotropic refers to the fact that the normal resistance and the tangential conductance are completely independent , describing a different behavior in the two directions . as discussed below , in order to integrate both the normal and tangential features , two dual schemes are possible , as shown in fig.[figure1 ] .",
    "they exploit the classical t and @xmath10 electric lattice structures . by means of this approach",
    "we take into account all situations comprised between the low and high conducting interface models , which can be seen as limiting cases of the present theory . in our schemes",
    "both the potential and the normal component of the current density are discontinuous at the interface .",
    "the richness of the proposed models allows us to effectively describe the behavior of real imperfect / multilayered / structured interfaces , which can be found in several heterogeneous materials of technological interest and , in particular , for those displaying a complex nanoscale structure .    at first",
    ", we have applied the generalized interfaces to model a single particle embedded in a different matrix ( inhomogeneity ) .",
    "one of the most important technique used to study this system is based on the eshelby formalism .",
    "it has been introduced in the context of the isotropic elasticity theory,@xcite generalized to the anisotropic elasticity@xcite and applied to the electric , magnetic or thermal case.@xcite a relevant universal property states that the field induced in cylindrical or spherical particles with zero - thickness low or high conducting interfaces is uniform if the externally applied field is so .",
    "it is true for both isotropic constituents and anisotropic ones , as recently proved.@xcite in the present work , we show that the uniformity property of the internal field for spheres and cylinders is preserved also for our generalized interface models .",
    "moreover , to extend the validity of the eshelby approach , we propose a method which is able to determine the field within and around a single particle even if the externally applied field is not uniform .",
    "the previous results have been applied to determine the overall conductivity ( through an effective medium theory@xcite ) of a dispersion of particles with imperfect interfaces .",
    "we have verified that , in contrast to perfectly bonded inclusions , the effective properties depend upon the size of the inhomogeneities .",
    "interestingly enough , while in the case of low or high conducting interfaces the scale effects are described by monotone scaling laws , the present generalized models show non - monotone scale effects with a sizeable peak of the transport properties .",
    "this point can be considered as a specific signature of the complex resistive / conductive behavior of the interface .",
    "a description of this intriguing behavior has been made through different intrinsic length scales governing the universal scaling laws .",
    "typical material science problems where these interface models can be profitably applied are the following : tailoring of composites with semiconductor whiskers;@xcite thermal optimization of metal / dielectric interfaces@xcite and change materials through nanoclusters of stable oxides;@xcite analysis of thermal and electric conductivity of carbon - based nanostructures;@xcite size effects understanding in sic / epoxy ( or similar ) nanocomposites.@xcite    throughout all the paper we develop the formalism with the terminology of the electrical transport , but all results can be applied to the analogous situations of thermal conduction , antiplane elasticity , magnetic permeability and electric permittivity as well .",
    "to begin , we introduce a simple lattice network taking into account the normal resistors @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the tangential conductance @xmath13 ( see fig.[figure1 ] , t - model ) .",
    "this structure is able to consider both the anisotropy ( along the normal and tangential directions ) and the different behavior of the normal conductivity on the two sides of the interface . for the moment we consider a curvilinear interface between two different materials of a planar structure ( 2d geometry ) .",
    "the generalization to the arbitrary three - dimensional case will be made straightforwardly . by a direct application of the kirchhoff circuit laws we obtain two equalities describing the voltage jump and current jump across the interface ( the definition of the relevant quantities is shown in fig.[figure1 ] ) @xmath14 in the limit of a continuous zero - thickness interface we easily obtain from eqs.([uno ] ) and ( [ due ] ) the relations for the interface in the form",
    "@xmath15 the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath9 are the suitably rescaled counterparts of @xmath12 , @xmath11 and @xmath13 ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 are measured in @xmath19m@xmath20 and @xmath9 in @xmath21).@xcite in previous expressions , the partial derivatives are performed with respect to the variable @xmath22 , which represents the curvilinear abscissa along the arbitrarily curved interface on the plane . as usual , in the three - dimensional case the operator @xmath23 must be substituted with the surface laplacian @xmath24 , which is introduced and discussed in appendix a. we can observe that the present approach reproduces the _ low conducting interface _ model if @xmath25 ( with a kapitza resistance @xmath26 ) and the _ high conducting interface _ model if @xmath27 .",
    "the low conducting model is characterized by a sequence of normal resistances @xmath28 ( t - model with @xmath29 ) .",
    "if we consider @xmath30 as the step along the curvilinear abscissa @xmath22 and @xmath31 as the step along the direction perpendicular to the plane represented in fig.[figure1 ] we have @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the normal conductivity of the interphase of thickness @xmath34 .",
    "the kapitza resistance is therefore given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the area element associated to @xmath37 ; we finally obtain @xmath38.@xcite similarly , the high conducting model is characterized by a series of tangential conductances @xmath13 ( t - model with @xmath39 ) .",
    "it is simple to observe that @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the tangential conductivity of the interphase .",
    "the specific conductivity is therefore given by @xmath42 ( where @xmath36 ) and we obtain the result @xmath43.@xcite so , we have a direct link between the interphase properties ( @xmath34 , @xmath33 , @xmath41 ) and the models parameters ( @xmath7 , @xmath9 ) for the high and low conducting interfaces .",
    "interestingly enough , we observe that when we consider an anisotropic single layer interphase ( which is uniaxial or transversely isotropic with normal conductivity @xmath33 and tangential conductivity @xmath41 ) , the only component @xmath33 is relevant for the low conducting model and the only component @xmath41 is relevant for the high conducting interface .    of course",
    ", if both relations @xmath25 and @xmath27 are satisfied in the t - model , then the ideal interface is simply obtained .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that this model is completely equivalent to a series of three different ideal sheets ( multi - layered interface ) a , b and c : an external low conducting phase with kapitza resistance @xmath44 , a halfway high conducting phase with specific conductance @xmath45 and , finally , an internal low conducting phase with kapitza resistance @xmath46 .",
    "the three layers are characterized by thickness @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 ( with @xmath50 ) and conductivities @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "so , we have built an example of interpretation of the model parameters with a concrete physical multilayered structure .",
    "a dual model can be introduced by considering the second structure depicted in fig.[figure1 ] ( @xmath10-model ) . a procedure similar to the previous one leads to the following interface equations @xmath54 where the parameters @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the suitably rescaled counterparts of @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , appearing in fig.[figure1 ] , right .",
    "as before , the operator @xmath23 must be substituted with the surface laplacian @xmath24 for the 3d case .",
    "we can prove that also the @xmath10-model is exactly equivalent to a series of three different ideal sheets : an external high conducting phase with conductance @xmath61 , a halfway low conducting phase with kapitza resistance @xmath62 and , finally , an internal high conducting phase with conductivity @xmath63 .",
    "as before , the layers are characterized by thickness @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and conductivities @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "it is important to remark that the interpretation of the model through three adjacent layers ( for both the t and @xmath10 structures ) it is not restrictive ; in fact , the proposed schemes can be also used to effectively represent different imperfect interfaces with all parameters fitted in order to mimic their correct behavior .",
    "we also underline that some more complete models have been proposed in literature ( see , e.g. , the recent gu and he interface,@xcite which also degenerates to the high or low conducting models and it is able to take into account all the coupling among the electric , magnetic and elastic fields ) ; here , we have proposed our schemes with the idea to find a compromise between the complexity and the possibility to analytically solve the problem for paradigmatic composite structures .",
    "the proposed models are dual from both the geometrical point of view , as shown by the t and @xmath10 lattice structures , and the physical point of view , as discussed below through the results for the composite materials .",
    "we consider now a single circular ( in 2d ) or spherical ( in 3d ) particle with conductivity @xmath67 embedded into a matrix with conductivity @xmath68 ( see fig.[figure2 ] ) : we suppose that the interface between the constituents is described by eqs.([saltov1 ] ) and ( [ saltoj1 ] ) ( t - model ) and we determine the effect of an arbitrary externally applied field .",
    "since we are dealing with two isotropic phases , in order to solve the problem we can directly apply the original idea of maxwell,@xcite which is based on the following steps .",
    "firstly , we observe that the electrical potential must be an harmonic function both inside and outside the particle : therefore , it can be straightforwardly expanded in trigonometric series ( in 2d ) and in series of spherical harmonics ( in 3d).@xcite secondly , we can substitute such expansions in the interface conditions , by obtaining a set of equations for the unknown coefficients , completely describing the potential both inside and outside the inhomogeneity .",
    "( color online ) scheme of a single circular ( a ) or spherical ( b ) particle with conductivity @xmath67 embedded into a matrix with conductivity @xmath68 .",
    "the interface between the two phases is described by either eqs.([saltov1 ] ) and ( [ saltoj1 ] ) or eqs.([saltov2 ] ) and ( [ saltoj2]).,width=309 ]    to accomplish this last step we must determine the surface laplacian of the series expansions : to do this we remember that the trigonometric functions and the spherical harmonics are eigenfunctions of the @xmath69 operator with certain eigenvalues described in appendix a. the complete procedure , which is valid for any externally applied field , is described in appendix b for the 2d case and in appendix c for the 3d case . here , we are interested in the particular case with an uniform applied electric field @xmath70 , corresponding to a potential @xmath71 ( see fig.[figure2 ] ) .",
    "the perturbation induced by the inhomogeneity with imperfect contact has been eventually found as @xmath72 where @xmath73 for the circle , @xmath74 for the sphere and the parameters @xmath75 and @xmath76 are defined as follows @xmath77 \\left [ 1 + r^-\\frac{\\sigma_{2}}{r}\\right ] , \\\\",

    "so , the previous result can be used for analysing the scale effects induced by the imperfect contact . from eq.([dentro ] ) it is easy to identify the induced internal field as @xmath78 .",
    "a first scaling law for @xmath79 can be obtained by introducing the classical lorentz field for a particle with a perfect interface @xmath80 ; we can easily prove that @xmath81 where we have introduced the following intrinsic length scales @xmath82 which automatically emerge from the analysis and completely control all the scaling laws .",
    "eq.([scalefield ] ) means that the internal field approaches the lorentz field for large radius of the particle ( @xmath83 ) , i.e. the effects of the contact imperfection are vanishingly small for @xmath79 .",

    "therefore , the proposed models perfectly implement the multiscale paradigm by introducing the effective properties of a given interface behavior .",
    "we remark that in this section we have used the generalization of the maxwell approach@xcite or the mori - tanaka scheme@xcite in order to obtain simple results and to directly analyse the scale effects induced by the imperfect interfaces .",
    "nevertheless , the closed form results discussed in section iii for the single particle response can be easily exploited to implement other homogenization techniques such as the differential method@xcite , the self consistent scheme@xcite , the generalized - self - consistent model@xcite and the strong - property - fluctuation theory.@xcite we also remark that the analysis of the imperfect interfaces is an important topic also in the field of micromechanics ( elasticity of composites ) where several theoretical models have been proposed@xcite and intriguing scale effects have been observed.@xcite",
    "in this paper we have taken into consideration the possible scale effects induced by imperfect interfaces between the constituents of an heterogeneous system . to this aim we introduced two generalised schemes , namely the t and @xmath10 structures , which can be seen as natural combinations of the so - called low and high conducting interface models .",
    "one important property discussed concerns the uniformity of the physical fields in circular or spherical particles with t or @xmath10 imperfect interfaces .",
    "this point extends well known theorems proving the uniformity in different conditions and opens the possibility to study the behavior of new interfaces in anisotropic , elliptic and ellipsoidal particles , which are standard problems in the theory of inhomogeneities .",
    "the results for a single inclusion were applied to the analysis of the effective properties of dispersions . in particular",
    "we studied the scale effects and we found interesting behaviors , which generalize those observed with low and high conductivity interfaces .",
    "we indeed observed a specific peak of the effective conductivity in correspondence to a critical radius of the dispersed particles : it corresponds to the competition between the tendency to attain the maxwell conductivity limit for a large radius and the conduction properties of the interface , which tend to increase or decrease the overall conductivity , depending on the specific parameters .",
    "this is exactly the trend observed in recent analysis of imperfect interfaces in nanocomposites ( hard particles in polymeric matrix or similar mixtures ) . to conclude",
    ", we have analysed the neutrality properties of the t and @xmath10 models : contrarily to the low and high conducting interface , we have proved that it is possible to satisfy the neutrality condition for any contrast @xmath165 between the conductivities of the involved phases .",
    "so , eqs.([neutt ] ) and ( [ neupi ] ) are the updated versions of the neutrality criteria , representing the generalizations of some findings , published in recent literature .",
    "we remark that all the achievements of the present paper can be also used in dynamic regime if we consider a wavelength @xmath166 of the propagating waves that is much larger than the radius @xmath58 of the particles . in this case",
    "we are working in the so - called quasi - static regime and any inhomogeneity feels a nearly static applied field .",
