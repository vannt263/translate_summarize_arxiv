    "using considerable mathematical ingenuity perjes ( 1971 ) and later israel & wilson ( 1972 ) showed that metrics of the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a complex solution of laplace s equation @xmath8 satisfy the einstein - maxwell equations for the electromagnetic fields , @xmath9 @xmath10 whenever @xmath11 is a solution of @xmath12 in the above @xmath13 stands for @xmath14 and to obtain metrics that become flat at infinity we need @xmath15 there .",
    "+ hereafter we write @xmath16 however , except for extreme kerr - newman metrics ( see below ) , such solutions are not known to be the external solutions of any real matter distributions .",
    "when @xmath17 the metrics are conformastatic and then we know that they are external metrics of static charged dust with the electric and gravitational forces in exact balance [ see synge 1960 ] and for the continuous case , e.g. , lynden - bell et al .",
    "most workers guessed that the conformastationary metrics would be the metrics of moving charged dust with those forces balancing because cylindrical conformastatic systems would make conformastationary balanced systems when set in uniform motion along the cylinder .",
    "however we show here that axially symmetrical conformastationary solutions with disk sources always need hoop tension to balance the centrifugal forces so that moving charged dust sources are insufficient to maintain equilibrium when the dust is accelerated with respect to the static frame . in such cases the electromagnetic and gravitational forces balance but the centrifugal forces would be unbalanced for charged dust without the introduction of these hoop tensions .",
    "the theory of disk sources has a long history .",
    "morgan & morgan ( 1969 ) introduced pressureless counter - rotating disks while lynden - bell & pineault ( 1978 ) gave a self - similar disk in real rotation .",
    "lemos ( 1989 ) discussed the peculiarly interesting case of the counter - rotating photon disk which has accelerating minkowski space on each side and generalised the self - similar disks to include surface pressures .",
    "more general solutions have been obtained by chamorro et al ( 1987 ) and quite a number of exact solutions with and without any radial pressure are now known ( bik et al 1993 a+b , bik and ledvinka 1993 , pichon & lynden - bell 1996 , gonzles & letelier 1999 ) .",
    "discs can now be constructed with the full freedom in the pressure distribution and surface density but truly rotating disks can only be constructed for those special external metrics which are already known solutions of einstein s equations . essentially all others need to be computed although neugebauer and meinel ( 1995 ) made their calculations of the finite uniformly rotating dust disk as analytic as possible .",
    "a similar procedure to that of constructing the physical disk sources of the vacuum kerr metrics has recently been used to find disks with rotating matter and electric currents which are sources of kerr - newman fields ( ledvinka et al .",
    "the extreme kerr - newman solutions are special cases of conformastationary fields .",
    "the wonderful simplicity of the conformastatic metrics in which electrostatic forces balance gravity , see e.g. , ( lynden - bell et al . 1999 ) , encouraged us to discover whether the conformastationary metrics had sources of similar simplicity .",
    "we were somewhat dismayed to find that hoop tensions were a necessity although we had gained the insight that they are only required to balance the centrifugal accelerations . with that exception the electromagnetic and gravitational forces balance with the latter including gravomagnetic forces .",
    "the new aspect of electromagnetic disks is that while components of * e * within the surface must be continuous across the disk the surface components of * h * have a discontinuity equal to the surface currents in it",
    ". the normal component of * b * has to be continuous to preserve the magnetic flux through the surface .",
    "these conditions are readily satisfied if one chooses a complex solution of laplace s equation @xmath18 defined only in the region @xmath19 and then continues it into @xmath20 by the definition @xmath21 with this definition the real part of @xmath7 is continuous across @xmath22 although the imaginary part is not , and the imaginary part of @xmath23 is continuous although the real part is not .",
    "furthermore , @xmath24 is continuous .",
    "it follows that @xmath7 obeys laplace s equation ( 1.2 ) everywhere excepting @xmath22 where the charges and currents lie , and from ( 1.3 ) the continuity conditions on @xmath25 and @xmath26 are automatically accounted for by the above continuation of @xmath7 to negative @xmath27 values .",
    "the discontinuities in external curvatures give both the surface mass density and the matter currents as considered by bik & ledvinka ( 1993 ) and by pichon & lynden - bell ( 1996 ) ; see also ledvinka et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "we detail these equations below .",
    "the symmetry of the solutions above and below the disk already ensures that the intrinsic curvatures in the disk metric calculated from the metrics above and below exactly fit .",
    "we consider the metric ( 1.1 ) for axially symmetric spacetimes in @xmath28 following ( 1.1 ) , @xmath29 has then only one non - vanishing component in these coordinates @xmath30 the metric can be written @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are functions of ( @xmath35 , @xmath27 ) .",
    "the components of the metric thus are : @xmath36 with their inverse being @xmath37 and @xmath38 the local tetrad @xmath39 used below is the one appearing in ( 2.2 ) , i.e. , @xmath40 @xmath41 the dual tetrad reads ( the tetrad indices being shifted by minkowski metric ) @xmath42 @xmath43 this is the orthonormal frame used by static observers who are at rest with respect to infinity .",
    "the zero - angular - momentum observers whose worldlines are orthogonal to @xmath44 = const .",
    "hypersurfaces will use `` locally non - rotating frames '' ( e.g. , misner et al 1973 ) given by @xmath45\\ , \\ ] ] @xmath46 @xmath47\\ , \\eqno ( 2.8)\\ ] ] and @xmath48\\ , \\\\ ] ] @xmath49 @xmath50\\ .",

    "the metric of the @xmath22 hypersurface is @xmath52 where indices  @xmath53 the components  @xmath54 are given in ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.4 ) while @xmath55 the unit normal vector to the hypersurface @xmath56 is @xmath57 @xmath58 if @xmath59  points in the positive ( negative ) @xmath27 direction .",
    "we shall now consider two spacetimes @xmath60 and @xmath61 with the metric ( 2.2 ) in which ( see 1.5 ) @xmath62 and the complex @xmath7 is a solution of e.g. , ( 1.2 ) or , in @xmath63 coordinates , @xmath64 in @xmath60 sources of @xmath7 are on the @xmath20 side , in @xmath65 is exchanged with @xmath66 and the `` conjugate '' sources are on the positive side @xmath19  see figure 1 .",
    "so @xmath61 is the complexified mirror symmetric image of @xmath60 in @xmath22 .",
    "the spacetime we are interested in is the third spacetime @xmath67 which is composed of @xmath60 for @xmath19 and @xmath61 for @xmath20 .",

    "thus , by integrating einstein s equations , @xmath73 across the disk we can calculate @xmath70 in terms of the metric components .",
    "the non - zero components of @xmath74 are particularly simple if written in terms of two new quantities @xmath75 we find that , @xmath76 the projected components in the local tetrad ( 2.6 ) are respectively @xmath77    the vanishing of @xmath78 and , hence , also of the stress @xmath79 as measured by static observers , is the specific feature of conformastationary metrics ( 2.2 ) . with more general metrics of the form @xmath80\\ , \\eqno ( 3.9)\\ ] ] in which @xmath81 , as is the case e.g. , with the kerr - newman metrics , one obtains ( see ledvinka et al .",

    "on both sides of the disk , spacetime is free of charges and currents .",
    "maxwell s equations thus are @xmath110 a `` @xmath111 '' means multiplication by @xmath112 ( see 2.5 ) , and @xmath113 according to perjes ( 1971 ) and israel and wilson ( 1972 ) , and following ( 1.1 ) and ( 5.1 ) , @xmath114 is of the form @xmath115 with @xmath116 @xmath117 is the alternating symbol , and @xmath118 is some function of @xmath119 . both @xmath120 and @xmath118 , which",

    "the discontinuities in the @xmath27 direction defines the components @xmath127 of the surface current density @xmath128 and the symmetry @xmath129 implies that the discontinuity in the @xmath130 components are just equal to twice @xmath131 on the positive side of the disk @xmath132 .",

    "the surface current @xmath147 is given by ( 5.10 ) , and the charge per unit surface , @xmath148 , is defined by ( 5.9 ) .",
    "a simple example is given later .",

    "has a familiar look @xmath161 consider now the @xmath162 term in ( 7.2 ) : @xmath163with @xmath164 and @xmath165 given by ( 3.8 ) and @xmath166 in ( 2.3 ) , ( 7.9 ) may be rewritten as @xmath167 this is the radial component of the gravitational force ,    @xmath168 expressed in terms of the gravoelectric and gravomagnetic field components defined by    @xmath169 and the matter current in the disk ,    @xmath170    with ( 7.8 ) and ( 7.11 ) - ( 7.13 ) , ( 7.2 ) appears clearly as the balance of electromagnetic and gravitational forces ; in vector notation ,    @xmath171 it is worth noting that electric and magnetic forces are not separately in equilibrium , i.e. @xmath172 unless @xmath173 .",
    "another notable point of equation ( 7.13 ) is the absence of centrifugal and pressure forces .",
    "these are in equilibrium by themselves ; it is best seen by considering explicitly @xmath84 which vanishes . with ( 4.3 ) we find that    @xmath174    in a weak gravitational field ( @xmath175 and with a slowly rotating disk ( @xmath176 ) , equation ( 7.15 ) becomes the classical condition    @xmath177 for the equilibrium in a rotating narrow circular band between the centrifugal force and the tensions that keep it from flying apart . of course , under this weak - field assumption , @xmath178@xmath179@xmath180 ( see 4.11 ) implies ( 7.16 ) as well .",
    "a simple example is the following complex solution of ( 3.4 ) : @xmath181 @xmath182are constants .",

    "thus , @xmath189 and @xmath190 or @xmath25  ,  @xmath26 are readily deduced from ( 8.5 ) .",
    "the disk is associated with two functions of r defined in ( 3.6 ) ; @xmath191 and @xmath192 notice that @xmath193 since @xmath194 and @xmath195 , the energy condition @xmath196 is satisfied for every @xmath197  .",

    "in particular , for @xmath201 in the disk @xmath202 @xmath203 @xmath204 from this follows that @xmath205  and @xmath206  defined in ( 4.4 ) become @xmath207 and @xmath208 electric charges and currents behave as follows : @xmath209 while @xmath210 thus , @xmath211 i.e. ,  mass and charge density become equal \" at great distances while @xmath212    let us finally evaluate the `` constants of motions '' with all the g s and c s .",
