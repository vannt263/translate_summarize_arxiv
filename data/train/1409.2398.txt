    "in the generalized function matching problem one is given a text @xmath0 and a pattern @xmath1 and the goal is to decide whether there is a match between @xmath1 and @xmath0 , where a single letter of the pattern is allowed to match multiple letters of the text ( we say that @xmath1 gf - matches @xmath0 ) .",
    "for example , if the text is @xmath2 and the pattern is @xmath3 , then a generalized function match ( on short , gf - match ) is @xmath4 , but if @xmath5 and @xmath6 , then there is no gf - match . if , moreover , the matching is required to be injective , then we term the problem generalized parameterzied matching ( gpm ) . in  @xcite , amir and nor describe applications of gfm in various areas such as software engineering , image searching , dna analysis , poetry and music analysis , or author validation .",
    "gfm is also related to areas such as ( un-)avoidable patterns  @xcite , word equations  @xcite and the ambiguity of morphisms  @xcite .",
    "gfm has a long history starting from 1979 .",

    "angluin s paper received a lot of attention , especially in the learning theory community  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a survey ) but also in many other areas .",
    "recently , a systematic study of the classical complexity of a number of variants of gfm and gpm under various restrictions has been carried out  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that gfm and gpm remain complete for many natural restrictions . moreover ,",
    "the study of gfm and its variants within the framework of parameterized complexity has recently been initiated  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the parameterized complexity of the optimization variant of gfm ( called max - gfm ) and its variants , where one is allowed to replace some of the pattern letters with some special symbols `` ? '' , termed wildcards or do nt cares , which can be mapped to an arbitrary substring of the text .",
    "the goal is to minimize the number of wildcards used .",
    "the problem was first introduced to the pattern matching community by amir and nor  @xcite .",
    "they show that if the pattern alphabet has constant size , then a polynomial algorithm can be found , but that the problem is complete otherwise .",
    "then , in  @xcite , it is shown the hardness of the gfm ( without wildcards ) and the hardness of the gfm when the function @xmath7 is required to be an injection ( named gpm ) . more specifically , gfm is hard even if the text alphabet is binary and each letter of the pattern is allowed to map to at most two letters of the text  @xcite . in the same paper",
    "it is given a @xmath8 approximation algorithm for the optimization variant of gfm where the goal is to search for a pattern @xmath9 that gf - matches @xmath0 and has the smallest hamming distance to @xmath1 .",

    "the max - gfm can be seen as the optimization variant of gfm in which we want to replace some of the pattern letters with special wildcard symbols , i.e. , the symbols @xmath19 , which can be mapped to any non - empty substring of the text .",
    "we also study the max - gpm problem .",
    "the only difference between max - gpm and max - gfm is that for max - gpm the function @xmath7 is required to be injective .",
    "the notions of gp - matching and @xmath17-gp - matching are defined in the natural way , e.g. , we say a pattern @xmath1 _ gp - matches _ a text @xmath0 if @xmath1 _ gf - matches _ @xmath0 using an injective function .    in this paper",
    "we study the parameterized complexity of the two problems using a wide range of parameters : maximum number of occurrences of a letter in the text @xmath20 , maximum number of occurrences of a letter in the pattern @xmath21 , size of the text alphabet @xmath22 , size of the pattern alphabet @xmath23 , the maximum length of a substring of the text that a letter of the pattern alphabet can be mapped to ( i.e. , @xmath24 ) , the number of wildcard letters @xmath25 , and the maximum length of a substring of the text that a wildcard can be mapped to , denoted by @xmath26 .",
