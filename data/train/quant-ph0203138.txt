    "the reliability of quantum information rests on the stability of quantum superposed state .",
    "since the quantum superposition is vulnerable to the effect of the environment , the degradation of the superposed state would affect the accuracy of the quantum information , especially in quantum computation .    in order to reduce errors caused by the environmental effects ,",
    "many methods have been proposed .",
    "these are roughly divided into two categories whether the methods requires ancillary bits or not .",
    "since the first proposal by shor@xcite , considerable works on the methods with additional qubits have been done to overcome the error by distributing the information of a qubit over several qubits @xcite including experimental studies of nmr@xcite and trapped ions @xcite . however , in these methods , it has been a main problem to keep the coherence of all the qubits including ancillary bits , which may be an obstacle for scale up of quantum computer .",
    "two distinctive approaches have been taken to attain strategies for control of decoherence without additional bits .",
    "firstly , closed - loop control ( quantum feedback ) method has been proposed@xcite .",
    "since they require the measurement on the system to control the error , the quantum detection efficiency gives a limitation to execution of the control .",
    "the other method to suppress the error by decoherence without ancillary bit has been called the open - loop control@xcite . in the pioneering works of viola and lloyd@xcite , and",
    "ban@xcite , they have proposed that a pulse train can be used to eliminate pure dephasing of a spin caused by interaction with a quantum reservoir .",
    "they assume that the spin linearly interacts with boson reservoir .",
    "the pure dephasing of superposed state is successfully suppressed by applying many successive short @xmath0 pulses .",
    "an actual evaluation has been done by using the coupling function for the macroscopic tunneling phenomena as proposed by caldeira and leggett@xcite . although the pulse methods have been well known in the field of nmr to decouple unnecessary spin - spin interaction@xcite , their formulation can also be applied to suppress decoherence in various systems other than the nuclear spin system .",
    "the applicability has been generally discussed in @xcite .",
    "application of a @xmath1 pulse train to a two - level system , which interacts with a boson reservoir by continuous coupling function , has been studied to discuss the controllability of unwanted spontaneous emission@xcite .",
    "the magnetic state decoherence by collisions in a vapor has been analyzed to be suppressed by ultra fast pulses@xcite .",
    "moreover , the method is applied to the damped vibrational mode of a chain of trapped ions@xcite .",
    "it is however noted that , in the analysis @xcite , the interaction between the spin and bosons are assumed to be linear in the boson field amplitude . we should recall that in many systems the dephasing phenomena can not be described with the linearly interacting spin - boson model , except for the ohmic case of the caldeira - leggett model .",
    "this is because the dephasing rate is given by the zero - frequency component of the power spectrum of interaction amplitude @xcite .",
    "a typical example is a localized - electron phonon system in which the phonon with zero frequency ( i.e. , translation of a whole crystal ) does not interact with the @xmath2 spin ( the two - level electron ) .",
    "the nonlinear interaction between the spin and phonons , where simultaneous multiple absorption and emission of phonons occurs , should be taken into account for the correct description of the dephasing phenomenon . in order to discuss the effectiveness and generality of the multipulse control of qubits ,",
    "a spin - boson model that includes nonlinear interaction is necessary .    in this paper , we present a general formulation free from a specific form of interaction , and apply this to the two cases ( 1)a phenomenological two - level model where the correlation function of the interaction decays exponentially and ( 2)a quadratically interacting localized - electron phonon system .",
    "this paper is composed as follows : in section [ sec:2 ] , a general formula which describes spin dynamics under multipulse control is obtained for an arbitrary interaction with the cumulant expansion method .",
    "the expression is written with the correlation function of interaction amplitude . in section [ sec:3 ] , we first apply the formula to a simple case of the exponentially decaying correlation function in order to generally discuss the memory effect of the reservoir causing the spin dephasing .",
    "we next apply the formula to a quadratically interacting localized - electron phonon system , and the dynamical behavior of spin is analyzed .",
    "discussion and concluding remarks for the usefulness of the multipulse control of spin dephasing are given in section [ sec:4 ] .",

    "hence force , we use the term `` spin '' as an arbitrary two - level quantum system with energy difference @xmath3 .",

    "<S> we present a general formulation to suppress pure dephasing by multipulse control . </S>",
    "<S> the formula is free from a specific form of interaction and is expressed in terms of the correlation function of arbitrary system - reservoir interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we first apply the formula to a phenomenological two - level model where the correlation function of the interaction decays exponentially . in this case , we analytically show that the pure dephasing time is effectively lengthened by the multipulse control . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we apply the formula to the spin - boson model where a spin nonlinearly interacts with a boson reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> we find the multipulse control works well when the pulse interval is sufficiently shorter than the correlation time of system - reservoir interaction . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in this case , the pure dephasing can also be suppressed by adjusting the pulse interval to the period of dynamical motion of reservoir . </S>"
