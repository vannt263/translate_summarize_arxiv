    "<S> rev .  </S>",
    "<S> b * 78 * , 075435 ( 2008 ) ] have found opening of band gaps at the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> this finding is in conflict with the tight - binding description of graphene which is closed gap for small strains . in this comment , </S>",
    "<S> we present first - principles calculations which refute the claim that strain opens band gaps in graphene .    </S>",
    "<S> gui _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite have used first - principles calculations to investigate the effect of planar strain on the electronic band structure of graphene , and have found opening of band gaps at the fermi level resulting from arbitrarily small uniaxial strains , applied parallel or perpendicular to the c - c bonds . however </S>",
    "<S> , tight - binding ( tb ) model on the honeycomb lattice with different nearest - neighbor hoppings in the three directions has been rigorously shown to be closed gap as long as the hoppings satisfy the triangle inequality . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the closed - gap tb model , which contains zero modes , has been further developed recently to include the effects of magnetic fields @xcite and corrugations in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the discrepancy between the first - principles calculations of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 and tb model has already been discussed @xcite but the reason has not been identified . </S>",
    "<S> one suggested explanation @xcite is that this band gap opening is an artifact of density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations . </S>",
    "<S> however , the possibility that the nearest - neighbor tb model is an incomplete description has not been ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    we remind that the dft methods essentially solve single - particle schrdinger equations ( kohn - sham equations ) for effective potentials based on the underlying lattice , and the tb model solves the same problem in a simplified approximation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it seems unlikely that qualitative differences exist between dft and tb band structures . </S>",
    "<S> we also see indications of possible error in ref .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> first , figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(c ) and 5(c ) of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 show a peculiar peak whose underlying cause is not explained . </S>",
    "<S> second , an energy gap is incorrectly ascribed to the tb band structure which is then plotted in fig .  4 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 with large symbols that hide the important band crossing .    in this comment , </S>",
    "<S> we check directly the first - principles calculations of ref .  1 by one of the available dft codes . </S>",
    "<S> we used the quantum - espresso @xcite package based on the pseudopotential plane - wave method . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained the pseudopotential c.pw91-van_ak.upf also from ref .  9 and used a kinetic - energy cutoff of 40  ry , a monkhorst - pack @xmath0-point mesh of @xmath1 , and a vacuum separation of @xmath2    along the @xmath3 axis . </S>",
    "<S> we chose these parameters as close as possible to those of ref .  1 for a more meaningful comparison . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite     ( a ) ( color online ) graphene honeycomb lattice . </S>",
    "<S> it is formed from a triangular bravais lattice with a two - atom basis consisting of @xmath4 and @xmath5 . under uniaxial </S>",
    "<S> strain the bravais lattice becomes centered rectangular . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) first brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 and @xmath7 enclose the irreducible wedges corresponding to the triangular and centered rectangular lattices , respectively.,width=226 ]    first , we determined the equilibrium lattice constant of graphene in the absence of strain . </S>",
    "<S> we found a value of @xmath8   , defined in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) , which is not significantly different from the 2.4669    found in ref .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> we then made calculations on graphene under uniaxial strain for two special cases , for which ref .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 has found maximum values for band - gap openings . </S>",
    "<S> these two cases are ( i ) 12.2% strain applied parallel to the c - c bond , i.e , along @xmath9 direction in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) , and ( ii ) </S>",
    "<S> 7.3% strain applied perpendicular to the c - c bond . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> recent experimental studies of strain in graphene have applied strains of up to 1.3% by stretching or bending a flexible substrate , on which graphene was deposited , and have measured them by raman spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite relatively large strains used in our calculations are more convenient to demonstrate the effects but the conclusions apply equally to smaller strains . </S>",
    "<S> the uniaxial strain deforms the triangular lattice of graphene into centered rectangular lattice , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> thus for case ( i ) , @xmath9 is fixed at 12.2% larger value than its unstrained value of @xmath10 , and the value of @xmath11 is varied until the stress in the @xmath11 direction becomes vanishingly small . </S>",
    "<S> of course , for each choice of @xmath11 , the positions of the atoms must be relaxed until interatomic forces become sufficiently small . </S>",
    "<S> we found poisson s ratio to be @xmath12 for case ( i ) . </S>",
    "<S> a similar procedure is used for case ( ii ) , with fixing @xmath11 at a value of 7.3% larger than the original value , and then optimizing @xmath9 . here </S>",
    "<S> poisson s ratio was found @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> the band structure we obtained for case ( i ) along the @xmath0-point path of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) is shown in the top panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , with its important portion magnified in the bottom panel . in the band plots </S>",
    "<S> , we used a regular @xmath0-point mesh of 60 points for the entire path and refined it by the addition of 20 extra points as shown in the magnified part . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a contact is clearly seen between the conduction and valence bands near @xmath14 on the @xmath15 line of the brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> the displacement of the dirac cone along @xmath15 toward @xmath16 is in agreement with the tb description of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> our fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 is to be compared with fig .  3 of ref .  1 , where they give a value of 0.486  ev for the band gap . in our calculation </S>",
    "<S> , we find a value of 0.498  ev for the energy splittings at @xmath14 and @xmath17 in the top panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , which is probably what is taken , in this case , as the band gap by ref .  1 , </S>",
    "<S> having missed the nearby band crossing .     </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) band structure of graphene under 12.2% strain applied parallel to c - c bond ( top ) . </S>",
    "<S> magnified portion of band structure near the contact point ( bottom).,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]   ( color online ) band structure of graphene under 12.2% strain applied parallel to c - c bond ( top ) . </S>",
    "<S> magnified portion of band structure near the contact point ( bottom).,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    the band structure corresponding to case ( ii ) is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , and must be compared with fig .  5 of ref .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference with case ( i ) is that here the band crossing occurs near the @xmath17 point on the @xmath18 line . </S>",
    "<S> this is equivalent to a shift of the dirac point along the @xmath15 line away from @xmath16 , i.e. , in the opposite direction to that of case ( i ) . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 a value of 0.170  ev is given for the band gap for this case . </S>",
    "<S> we found a value of 0.178  ev for the energy splittings at @xmath17 and @xmath14 , which is , as in the other case , close to the band gap given in ref .  1 .     </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) band structure of graphene under 7.3% strain applied perpendicular to c - c bond ( top ) . </S>",
    "<S> magnified portion of band structure near the contact point ( bottom).,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]   ( color online ) band structure of graphene under 7.3% strain applied perpendicular to c - c bond ( top ) . </S>",
    "<S> magnified portion of band structure near the contact point ( bottom).,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    in conclusion , our first - principles calculations establish that graphene under uniaxial strain is gapless in agreement with the tight - binding model . our numerical values and the general shape of band structures are quite similar to those found in ref .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> however , accidental degeneracies in the band structure have been disregarded in ref .  1 , and this has resulted in the appearance of spurious maxima in band gaps as a function of strain . </S>"
