    "single electrons confined in penning traps may represent a valid , experimentally viable system for the implementation of a quantum processor @xcite .",
    "our proposals have been encouraged by the astonishing results obtained in high precision experiments with a single electron @xcite and by the advances in trapping technology , from micro - traps @xcite to scalable open planar penning traps @xcite . in this spirit , it has also been put forward how to realize a quantum information channel , based on interacting spin chains , by means of trapped electrons @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on a linear array of electrons , each one confined in a micro - penning trap .",
    "our aim is to prove that , from the same physical system , we can derive a variety of interacting spin models .",
    "in particular , we show how to design and control the relevant terms in the effective spin hamiltonian . as a result",
    "a system of trapped electrons can be exploited to study the dynamics of a wide range of quantum spin models .",
    "we recall that these models are very important for the understanding of the rich phenomenology observed in several quantum many - body systems , such as quantum magnets and high temperature superconductors",
    ". moreover quantum spin systems are able to exhibit quantum phase transitions @xcite . to this end , it is critical to control and vary system parameters like the applied magnetic field and the spin - spin coupling strength . our method to shape",
    "the effective spin - spin interaction employs sequences of electromagnetic pulses alternated to periods of free evolution .",
    "this technique is similar to the refocusing schemes used in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments and relies , from the theoretical point of view , on the average hamiltonian theory @xcite .",
    "we point out that a system of trapped electrons presents several advantages over nmr implementations .",
    "the most important ones are scalability and the possibility to independently adjust the values of relevant quantities , like the spin precession frequencies and the spin - spin coupling .",
    "indeed their values depend on external parameters such as the magnetic field gradient , the inter - particle distance and the voltage applied to the trap electrodes @xcite .",
    "also other systems , like linear or planar arrays of trapped ions , enjoy some of these properties and , therefore , it has been proposed to use them as a quantum simulator for interacting spin chains @xcite . however working with trapped electrons we naturally have a system of spin one - half particles , without the need for artificially creating an effective two - level system .",
    "another difference between trapped ions and electrons relies in the typical resonance frequencies .",
    "ions are controlled by means of a sophisticated laser setup , while trapped electrons are manipulated by microwave or radio - frequency fields . in this respect",
    "trapped electrons can benefit from the same technology already developed for nmr spectroscopy .",
    "in this paper we consider both the case of electrons with the same spin precession frequency @xcite and the case of electrons with different spin precession frequencies @xcite .",
    "the frequency addressability , which is necessary to manipulate specific particles in the array , is obtained with the insertion of a magnetic field gradient .",
    "however this condition is required only to modify the interaction range and topology . in the case of electrons with the same spin precession frequency , we prove that , by flipping the spin state twice , we can effectively reduce or even cancel the spin dynamics due to the external uniform magnetic field . this way the effective spin system is subjected to a weaker magnetic field",
    ", whose intensity can go down to zero , without affecting the overall trap stability .",
    "the same resonant electromagnetic field , used to flip the spin , is able to produce coherent superpositions of the two spin states by adjusting its phase and duration .",
    "these operations are the building blocks of specific pulse sequences that allow to engineer the effective spin hamiltonian . by iterating such pulse sequences ,",
    "we obtain various interesting spin hamiltonians such as the ising model or the @xmath0 model .",
    "in addition , if we want to customize the interaction range and coordination number , we should apply similar sequences of pulses to selected subsets of spins in the array .",
    "the resulting spin system can exhibit a nearest neighbor ( nn ) as well as a long range interaction .",
    "the number of pulses in each sequence is relatively small and , most notably , does not depend on the number of spins in the array , thus making our procedure scalable .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ chain ] we briefly present the system of trapped electrons and review the derivation of the effective spin - spin interaction . in sec .",

    "the more technical details , concerning the design of the pulse sequences and the estimate of fidelity , are reported , respectively , in appendices [ seqs ] and [ err ] .",
    "let us consider a system of @xmath1 electrons confined in an array of micro - penning traps in the presence of linear magnetic gradients .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system can be written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 represents the single electron dynamics inside a trap and @xmath4 describes the coulomb interaction between electrons @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in eqs .",

    "following the approach described in @xcite the hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ h_nc ] ) , of a single electron can be written as @xmath20 where the annihilation operators @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 refer , respectively , to the magnetron , cyclotron and axial oscillators of the @xmath5-th electron and @xmath24 .",
    "the frequencies of the different electron motions are @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h_nc_rwa ] ) has been obtained under the assumptions @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we also assume that the cyclotron motion is in the ground state and the amplitude of the magnetron motion is sufficiently small ( axialization ) @xcite .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath31 represents the coupling , due to the magnetic gradient , between internal and external degrees of freedom of the particle .",
    "similarly , if the oscillation amplitude of the electrons is much smaller than the inter - trap distance , the part of the hamiltonian describing the coulomb interaction can be written as @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 with @xmath34 being the distance between the @xmath5-th and @xmath6-th particle .",
    "now we apply to the system hamiltonian the unitary transformation @xcite @xmath35 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath36 .",
    "this transformation formally removes , to the first order in @xmath37 , the interaction between the internal and the external degrees of freedom in hamiltonian ( [ h_nc_rwa ] ) and , at the same time , introduces a coupling between the spin motions of different electrons .",
    "consequently the spin part of the system hamiltonian can be recast as @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 the effective spin hamiltonian ( [ hchain ] ) exhibits a long range interaction between all the particles in the chain .",
    "the coupling strength decreases with the third power of the distance between particles , i.e. with a dipole - like behavior .",
    "moreover , @xmath40 and @xmath41 depend , respectively , on the axial frequency and the cyclotron and anomaly frequencies .",
    "since the trapping frequencies form a well defined hierarchy , the coupling in the longitudinal and transverse direction can be utterly different .",
    "for example , for typical experimental values of the cyclotron and axial frequencies , such as @xmath42 ghz and @xmath43 mhz , the ratio @xmath44 is less than @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , for practical purposes @xmath41 is often negligible with respect to @xmath40 . in particular , this is true when the difference between the spin frequencies of different particles is much larger than their @xmath46 spin - spin coupling strength . in this case",
    "the spin hamiltonian reduces to @xmath47 in hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ hnmr ] ) we have used the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) to neglect the interactions between spins along the @xmath11 and @xmath48 directions , since they give rapidly rotating terms .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hnmr ] ) is , therefore , similar to the nuclear spin hamiltonian of the molecules used to perform nmr experiments @xcite .",
    "however in nmr systems the spin frequency differentiation and the spin - spin couplings are determined by the chemical nature of the molecules , whereas in our system they depend on the value of the applied fields , that are under control of the experimenter .",
    "in this section we describe how to prepare and manipulate the spin state with an external oscillatory field .",
    "let us consider a magnetic field @xmath49 oscillating in the @xmath46 plane with frequency @xmath50 and phase @xmath51 such that @xmath52.\\ ] ] if we add this field to the system , the spin hamiltonian , eq .",

    "therefore when all the spins have the same precession frequency @xmath61 , a single resonant pulse suffices to produce the evolution of eqs .",
    "( [ puev1 ] ) and ( [ puev2 ] ) for each particle in the array . from eqs .",

    "consequently , the spin flip operation , eqs .",
    "( [ flip1 ] ) and ( [ flip2 ] ) , turns into @xmath71 . in a similar way",
    "a pulse applied for the time @xmath67 with @xmath72 produces a transformation corresponding to the application of @xmath73 .",
    "furthermore , always working in ip , if the pulse is applied for a time @xmath74 , we can obtain the pseudo - hadamard operations @xmath75 the coherent superposition of the spin states @xmath76 , @xmath77 for each particle can be achieved with a single multi - frequency pulse .",
    "hence , an appropriate choice of the frequency , duration and phase of the pulses allows for performing , apart from irrelevant phase factors , single qubit operations on each spin of the array .",
    "in this section we show that , by using the additional magnetic field ( [ bp ] ) , we can also adjust and control the form of the effective spin hamiltonian , starting from the models given by eqs .",

    "this is achieved by applying to the system specific sequences of pulses alternated to periods of free evolution .",
    "our approach is inspired to the refocusing schemes used in nmr experiments @xcite .",
    "similarly to this technique a key point is the choice of the different time scales .",
    "spin operations , operated by means of pulses , should be virtually instantaneous with respect to the free evolution of the system .",
    "therefore , the pulse duration should be much shorter than the free evolution time .",

    "hence , the application of the oscillating field ( [ bs ] ) gives rise to an effective static transverse magnetic field , whose strength can be controlled and modified , since it depends on the field amplitude @xmath101 .",
    "this tool may turn out useful in reproducing quantum models like ising system of spins . in this case",
    "the parameter @xmath102 should be comparable to the coupling strength @xmath40 between the spins .    moreover , we can engineer the spin - spin coupling , that is introduce an effective spin - spin interaction along the @xmath11 and @xmath48 axes .",
    "this is achieved by means of sequences of pulses , of the kind given in eqs .",
    "( [ p_x ] ) , ( [ pxdag ] ) , ( [ p_y ] ) , and ( [ pydag ] ) , affecting all the spins in the array .",
    "indeed , it can be easily proved that @xmath103 hence a sequence of two specific pulses , alternated to a period of free evolution under the hamiltonian @xmath104 , effectively modifies the direction of the spin - spin coupling .",
    "now , if we combine the three operations ( [ h_bs ] ) , ( [ px ] ) , and ( [ py ] ) we have that for @xmath105 @xmath106 with @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "in deriving relation ( [ shxyz ] ) we used the approximate identity @xcite @xmath109 with @xmath110 and @xmath111 , which is valid , to first order in @xmath58 , for @xmath112 much shorter than the typical time scale of the dynamics due to the hamiltonian @xmath113 .",
    "however , more elaborate sequences of pulses ( see appendix [ err ] ) give approximations to higher orders in @xmath58 @xcite . a recursive application of the sequence ( [ shxyz ] ) determines an effective evolution under the hamiltonian @xmath94 .",
    "we point out that , in this hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ hxyz ] ) , we can independently control and change the values of the parameters @xmath114 s and @xmath102 , since they depend , respectively , on the free evolution times @xmath112 s and on the pulse amplitude @xmath101 .",
    "consequently we obtain an hamiltonian @xmath94 with a variable relative strength of the spin - spin coupling in the @xmath11 , @xmath48 , and @xmath115 directions and a tunable transverse magnetic field .",
    "notice that we can also set @xmath116 for any desired @xmath5 or @xmath117 .",
    "this is achieved by simply choosing @xmath118 or switching off the external field @xmath119 . in this way",
    "various interesting quantum spin models can be derived from hamiltonian ( [ shxyz ] ) .",
    "for example for @xmath120 we obtain the ising model , whereas for @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) we obtain the @xmath0 model in its usual ( rotated ) basis .",
    "the spin hamiltonian ( [ hzeta ] ) can be written as @xmath123 where @xmath124 represents the coupling between the @xmath125-th nearest neighbor spins . in our system",
    "the interaction between spins has a dipole - like nature , i.e. it decreases with the third power of the inter - particle distance .",
    "consequently only the first few terms @xmath126 at the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ hpn ] ) play a significant role . in the following we are going to outline a procedure to independently control and modify , in a relatively simple way , the strength and the sign of the relevant @xmath126 terms . in other words",
    "we can design the interaction topology by enhancing or suppressing the coupling between the @xmath125-th nearest neighbors .",
    "this is achieved by iteratively applying to the system appropriate sequences consisting of pulses alternated to periods of free evolution . in our scheme each pulse affects simultaneously a specific subset of spins in the array .",
    "notice that if a particular pulse sequence @xmath127 modifies the spin hamiltonian @xmath104 , we can extend the same kind of coupling to the other directions by simply performing , according to eqs .",
    "( [ px ] ) and ( [ py ] ) , the sequences @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "therefore , we restrict ourselves to the transformations affecting the spin - spin coupling along the @xmath115 direction . furthermore , we are going to prove that the number of pulses in each sequence does not depend on the number of spins in the array , thus making our technique scalable with the system size .    as an example",
    ", we describe how to suppress the second nearest neighbor interaction by making use of three different transformations , defined as @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "each of them can be performed by a single multi - frequency pulse .",
    "the transformation @xmath133 consists in the simultaneous application of @xmath134 to all the spins in the odd sites of the array .",
    "the transformations @xmath135 and @xmath136 flip , instead , alternated couples of neighboring spins . in particular , @xmath137 affects the spin couples @xmath138 , whereas @xmath139 affects the couples @xmath140 .",
    "we prove in appendix [ seqs ] that the sequence @xmath141 corresponds to the system evolution for a time @xmath58 under the effective hamiltonian @xmath142 , where the coupling of each spin with its second nearest neighbors has been removed .",
    "indeed , since the term @xmath143 is small , the above sequence well approximates an effective nn hamiltonian .",
    "the transformations @xmath144 , @xmath131 and @xmath139 are the building blocks to construct other sequences which realize different kinds of spin hamiltonians .",
    "for example , as described in appendix [ seqs ] , we can easily invert the sign of @xmath104 , thus switching from an anti - ferromagnetic to a ferromagnetic interaction , or make the coupling strength between first and second nearest neighbors equal .",
    "this last case corresponds to an effective change in the array topology , since the number of nearest neighbors passes from two ( linear chain ) to four ( see fig .",
    "[ 2darray ] ) .",
    "in order to affect the coupling between neighboring spins of order higher than three , we should apply simultaneously the transformation @xmath134 to selected subsets of three or more spins along the chain .",
    "for example , as we show in appendix [ seqs ] , with a seven pulse sequence we can suppress the interaction between a spin and all its neighbors from the second up to the sixth nearest neighbors .",
    "in such a way we improve our approximation of a nn interacting spin chain .",
    "schematic drawing of a linear chain of @xmath1 spins ( upper part ) .",
    "when the first and second nearest neighbor coupling strengths are made equal , the linear chain becomes equivalent to a planar array ( lower part ) . ]",
    "in this section we discuss the performances of the scheme , based on the detailed analysis reported in appendix [ err ] . we emphasize that our treatment focuses on the limitations due to the mapping of the system of trapped electrons into the desired target system of interacting spins .",
    "hence , most experimental imperfections are not considered here .    as described in the previous section , to derive the effective spin hamiltonian we make use of the approximate identity ( [ tro ] ) or of more sophisticated approximations @xcite . as a consequence",
    "we introduce an error @xcite @xmath145 which measures the distance between the desired evolution @xmath146 and the approximated evolution @xmath147 .",
    "for instance , in our case the target unitary operator @xmath148 , with the effective spin hamiltonian @xmath94 of the kind of eq .",
    "( [ hxyz ] ) , is approximated to the fourth order in @xmath58 by the sequence @xmath127 , eq .",
    "( [ tro4 ] ) @xcite . by using some algebra",
    "( see appendix  [ err ] ) , we can bound the error associated to the application of a single sequence @xmath127 with @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the nn coupling strength and @xmath151 is , in good approximation , an increasing linear function of the number @xmath1 of electrons in the array .",
    "the exact form of @xmath151 depends on the specific target spin hamiltonian . from this result",

    "we prove in appendix  [ err ] that , if we iterate @xmath153 times the sequence @xmath127 the total error is @xmath154 .",

    "[ err ] we provide the explicit expression of @xmath151 for the @xmath0 and nn ising models .",
    "consequently we are able to estimate the upper bound of @xmath159 in both cases . in our analysis , we also take into account the error introduced by the derivation of the effective spin - spin coupling @xcite . in particular",
    ", the error @xmath160 due to the canonical transformation ( [ s ] ) satisfies the relation @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the mean axial oscillator excitation number .",

    "we obtain , according to eq .",
    "( [ jz ] ) , a nn coupling constant @xmath168 hz .",
    "we also assume that the spin frequencies of neighboring electrons differ of about 2 mhz , each pulse has a duration of the order of @xmath164s and the axial motion is cooled to the ground state . in order to simulate the @xmath0 model ( nn ising model ) for a time @xmath169 s with fidelity of @xmath170",

    "in particular the simulation of the @xmath0 model requires about 3000 pulses , whereas the ising model with nn coupling requires about 2000 pulses .",
    "notice that the ising model with dipole - like coupling requires no pulse sequence , since it is obtained , directly , by applying the field ( [ bs ] ) .",
    "therefore , in this case we only take into account , as a source of error , the thermal excitation of the axial oscillator which , according to eq .",

    "these spin operations , applied to all the particles or subsets of them , are alternated to periods of free evolution in a fashion similar to nmr refocusing schemes . to selectively address the electrons in the array , it is necessary to introduce a detuning between the characteristic spin frequencies by means of a magnetic gradient . in particular , we have shown that , in the case of a system without spin frequency differentiation , a two pulse sequence permits to reduce or even cancel the effect on the spin dynamics of the uniform magnetic field , without affecting the overall trap stability .",
