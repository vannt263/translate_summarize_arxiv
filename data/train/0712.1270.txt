    "we have already arguedezawadisk that spins make a ferromagnetic order and that the relaxation time is quite large even if the size @xmath0 is very small .",
    "in this paper we make an investigation of electron - electron interaction effects in the zero - energy sector of the graphene nanodisk consisting of @xmath0 states .",
    "we derive explicitly the direct and exchange interactions , where there is no su(@xmath0 ) symmetry .",

    "it is found to be as large as a few hundred mev , which means that a nonodisk is indeed a rigid ferromagnet .",

    "the emergence of zero - energy states is surprisingly rare . among typical nanodisks ,",
    "only trigonal zigzag nanodisks have degenerate zero - energy states and show metallic ferromagnetism , where the degeneracy can be controlled arbitrarily by designing the size .    it is convenient to introduce the size parameter @xmath0 for trigonal zigzag nanodisks as in fig.[fignanodisk](a ) .",
    "the size-@xmath0 nanodisk has @xmath0-fold degenerated zero - energy states@xcite , where the gap energy is as large as a few ev .",

    "for the case of @xmath50,@xmath51which gives @xmath52 , @xmath49 .",
    "we make some remarkable observations .",
    "first , the exchange energy is as large as the direct energy , which is the order of a few hundred mev .",
    "thus the spin stiffness @xmath40 is quite large , implying that nanodisks are rigid ferromagnets .",
    "furthermore , as we have seen numerically , all @xmath53 are the same order of magnitude for any pair of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , implying that the su(@xmath0 ) symmetry is broken but not so strongly in the hamiltonian ( [ hamilferro ] ) . hence , the zero - energy sector is described by the su(n ) heisenberg model as a rough approximation .",
    "these facts confirm our previous result@xcite that the relaxation time of the ferromagnetic - like spin polarization is quite large even if the size of trigonal zigzag nanodisks is very small .",
    "we investigate the coulomb blockade of nanodisks in a similar way to the case of conventional quantum dots .",
    "we consider the system comprised of nanodisks with right and left connected leads [ fig.[fignanodisk](b ) ] .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is written as @xmath56where @xmath57 is given by ( [ hamilferro ] ) , and@xmath58the hamiltonian @xmath59 describes a noninteracting electron gas in the leads with @xmath60 , while @xmath61 the tunneling interaction between the leads and the nanodisk with @xmath62 the tunneling coupling constant : we have assumed that the spin does not flip in the tunneling process .",
    "it is convenient to make the transformation@xmath63with@xmath64so that the right and left leads are combined into the `` even '' and `` odd '' leads .",
    "the lead hamiltonian @xmath59 is invariant under above transformation,@xmath65but the transfer hamiltonian is considerably simplified,@xmath66it looks as if the tunneling occurs only between the `` even '' lead and the nanodisk .    in the case of @xmath67 ,",
    "the system is reduced to the simple anderson model of quantum dot@xmath68and hence the physics is well known@xcite . however , for a general case , it is hard to study the electronic properties of the system because the interaction strengths @xmath39 take complicated values .",
    "another simple example is given by the system at the half - filling with @xmath69 .",
    "as we have argued , the ground state is ferromagnet and the relaxation time is very large even though @xmath0 is small .",
    "based on this fact we simplify the hamiltonian ( [ hamilferro ] ) by assuming that the nanodisk is a rigid ferromagnet with the spin direction @xmath70",

    "and then to the right lead .",

    "@xmath50,@xmath80    this hamiltonian looks similar to that of the @xmath0-dot system .",
    "however , there exists a crucial difference . on one hand , in the ordinary @xmath0-dot system",
    ", an electron hops from one dot to another dot [ fig.[figferrodisk](a ) ] .",
    "on the other hand , in our nanodisk system , the index @xmath54 of the hamiltonian runs over the @xmath0-fold degenerated states and not over the sites . according to the hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) , an electron does not hop from one state to another state [ fig.[figferrodisk](b ) ] .",
    "hence , it is more appropriate to regard our nanodisk as a one - dot system with an internal degree of freedom .",
    "this fact simplifies the analysis considerably .",
    "we investigate the coulomb blockade in the nanodisk - lead system . it has been argued that the conductance is given by the formula@xcite,@xmath81where @xmath82 is the spectral function of the nanodisk system",
