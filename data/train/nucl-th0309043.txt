    "weak processes , such as beta ( @xmath1 ) and double - beta ( @xmath2 ) decay , have deep consequences for nucleosynthesis @xcite and physics beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "weak processes are also sensitive to details of nuclear structure : allowed gamow - teller ( gt ) transitions depend in particular upon pauli blocking @xcite .",
    "thus , predictions for astrophysics as well as interpretation of @xmath2-decay experiments must be modeled with care .",
    "because of this sensitivity to pauli blocking and thus upon configuration mixing , the large - basis interacting shell model ( sm ) @xcite provides one of the best microscopic approaches to gamow - teller transitions .    the interacting shell model , however , is computationally expensive , and only recently has the full @xmath3-shell become tractable .",
    "a simpler approach is the random phase approximation ( rpa ) and its generalizations , which have been widely and successfully applied to giant resonances such as the electric dipole ( giant dipole resonance or gdr ) @xcite , and has also been applied to many important problems in weak transitions @xcite .",
    "it is not immediately obvious , however , that the rpa is an appropriate approximation for _ all _ transitions .",
    "because the rpa is the small - amplitude limit of time - dependent mean - field theory @xcite , it seems appropriate for the gdr , which can be described semiclassically in the goldhaber - teller model @xcite as protons oscillating in bulk against neutrons .",
    "the application of the rpa and its extensions to gamow - teller transitions , although with a long history @xcite , is more problematic .",
    "two implicit assumptions in the rpa are , first , ground - state correlations on top of a mean - field state are small , and , second , particle - hole phonons have boson commutation rules , which means that pauli blocking is not fully treated . therefore , as gt transitions are sensitive to pauli blocking , they may not be well matched to rpa calculations .",
    "reading the literature only furthers these doubts .",
    "a number of authors have previously tested the efficacy of calculating gt transitions within the proton - neutron quasiparticle rpa ( pnqrpa ) , through comparison with exact calculations either with full shell - model diagonalization @xcite or group - theoretical schematic models @xcite .",
    "the efficacy of these pnqrpa calculations , which we will discuss in more detail below , can be broadly summarized as poor , typically overestimating the total transition strength and underestimating the first moment of the transition strength . in order to compare with the calculations described below ,",
    "is important to understand that these calculations used spherical @xmath4 , @xmath5-even @xmath6-even parent states and treated pairing carefully , starting with either the hartree - fock - bogoliubov or the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer equations .    with the exception of those tests of gamow - teller transitions ,",
    "however , most other tests of the rpa and its generalizations have been against toy models .",
    "recently we began to systematically test the rpa against full shell - model diagonalization @xcite . in this paper",
    "we describe the generalization to proton - neutron rpa ( pnrpa ) and compare gamow - teller transitions against the full shell - model results .",
    "in contrast to previous approaches , we do not treat pairing carefully , but do allow arbitrary deformation , even though we do not project to good angular momentum .",
    "furthermore we are not limited to even - even nuclides .",
    "we obtain good transition strengths , and where we can compare to published spherical pnqrpa strengths , our calculations are generally superior .",
    "we therefore conclude that proper treatment of deformation , even without projection , is at least as important as proper treatment of pairing , and arguably more so .",
    "this agrees with shell model studies that show a correlation between e2 transition strengths ( a measure of deformation ) and gt transition strengths @xcite .",
    "we also briefly argue that the pnrpa frequencies should be real , and not complex ; such an argument is missing from the literature . included in",
    "this discussion is a lemma helpful to understanding the solution of the pnrpa eigenvalue equations .",
    "in this paper we consider only change - changing gamow - teller transitions ; the transition operators are thus : @xmath7 where @xmath8 changes a neutron into a proton . because here we consider only strength",
    "_ distributions _ and not absolute transition strengths , we drop the axial vector coupling @xmath9 . the transition strength from the parent state @xmath10 ( here always a ground state ) to a final state @xmath11 at excitation energy @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 the transition strength to a given level is also often called the b(gt ) value .    a convenient way to characterize the distribution of transition strength is through moments .",
    "the zeroth moment is the total transition strength , @xmath14 , @xmath15 while the _ centroid _ of the distribution @xmath16 is the first moment @xmath17 ( note that this centroid is relative to the parent energy @xmath18 ) and the _ width _ of the distribution , @xmath19 , is the square root of the second moment , calculated relative to the centroid : @xmath20    an important check of any calculation is the well - known ikeda sum rule , which holds true for any parent state , both in the sm and in the rpa : @xmath21    we now briefly review the random phase approximation and its variant , the proton - neutron rpa ( pnrpa ) @xcite . unlike the standard or like - particle rpa , pnrpa provides means to calculate excited states of neighboring isobars .",
    "the starting point , however , is similar to the regular rpa : a mean - field solution of the parent nucleus , which in turn defines a particle - hole basis . in our case",
    "we began with a hartree - fock state @xmath22 , allowing unrestricted deformation .",
    "the rpa can be derived a number of ways , but it essentially approximates the energy surface about the mean - field state as a harmonic oscillator .",
    "this leads to an rpa ground state @xmath23 , which implicitly includes zero - point fluctuations about the mean - field state @xmath22 , and excited states are one - phonon excitations on the ground state : @xmath24 for rpa one usually assumes the creation operators are simple one - particle , one - hole operators .",
    "in order to properly discuss the pnrpa , it is useful to further , if briefly , recapitulate the like - particle rpa @xcite . in the matrix formalism ,",
    "one solves @xmath25 here the matrix @xmath26 , a hermitian matrix , is in fact the submatrix of @xmath27 between one - particle , one - hole states ( also the matrix for the tamm - dancoff approximation ) , while the elements of @xmath28 , a symmetric matrix , are the matrix elements of @xmath27 between the hf state and two - particle , two - hole states .",
    "( for simplicity we assume real hf wavefunctions so that all subsequent quantities are real . )",
    "one can show that the excitation frequencies @xmath29 are real if the stability matrix , @xmath30 has no negative eigenvalues ; this is equivalent to the hartree - fock state being at a ( local ) minimum .",
    "part of the proof of this requires that both @xmath31 have no negative eigenvalues @xcite , which in turn requires that @xmath26 have no negative eigenvalues .",
    "we emphasize this point because the situation will be different for pnrpa .",
    "one can show that the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ rpaeq ] ) come in pairs : if @xmath32 is a solution with frequency @xmath29 , then @xmath33 is also a solution with frequency @xmath34 .",
    "the solution with @xmath35 is associated with the vector @xmath32 such that @xmath36 , and one chooses a normalization @xmath37 ; that one can do this also derives from the nonnegative eigenvalues of the stability matrix .",
    "the special case @xmath38 corresponds to invariance of the hamiltonian under a symmetry , for example , rotation or translation ; here the vector @xmath32 can not be normalized , as @xmath39 , and one must resort to a different formalism @xcite .",
    "the proton - neutron rpa is similar to the like - particle rpa but with important differences . for like - particle rpa ,",
    "the phonon creation operator @xmath40 uses one - particle , one - hole operators of the form @xmath41 , @xmath42 ( thus the name like - particle ) .",
    "the pnrpa phonon creation operator is also one - body but changes the third component of isospin @xmath43 : @xmath44 the first and the fourth terms in this equation describe the excited states of the @xmath45 isobar , while the second and third the @xmath46 isobar .",
    "we follow the standard convention and use indices @xmath47 for ` particle ' states , that is , unfilled single - particle states in the hartree - fock wavefunction , and @xmath48 for ` hole ' states , or filled single - particle states ; thus @xmath49 destroys a filled neutron state ( or creates a neutron hole in the hf wavefunction , in the usual view ) and creates a proton in an excited particle state .",
    "the equation of motion @xmath50| \\mathrm{rpa } \\rangle = \\omega \\langle \\mathrm{rpa } |[\\delta\\beta,\\beta^\\dagger]|\\mathrm{rpa } \\rangle,\\ ] ] transforms as usual to a non - hermitian eigenvalue problem @xcite @xmath51 where the definitions for @xmath52 and @xmath53 matrices are similar to the regular proton - neutron conserving formalism , where one approximates @xmath54| { \\rm hf }",

    "let @xmath58 , @xmath59 be number of proton particle and hole states , respectively , and @xmath60 , @xmath61 the number of neutron particle and hole states .",
    "thus the vectors @xmath62 and @xmath63 are of length @xmath64 while vectors @xmath65 , @xmath66 are of length @xmath67 ; the two lengths are unequal unless @xmath57 .",
    "similarly , @xmath68 is a square matrix of dimension @xmath64 while @xmath69 is a square matrix of dimension @xmath67 , while @xmath70 is a rectangular matrix of dimension @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "the zeroes in eq .",
    "( [ pnrpaeq ] ) occur because the original hamiltonian conserves charge ( and thus @xmath43 ) .",
    "the overall form of eq .",
    "( [ pnrpaeq ] ) is identical to that of eq .",
    "( [ rpaeq ] ) ; we have merely introduced a block structure to @xmath26 , @xmath28 . because of the zeroes in eq .",
    "( [ pnrpaeq ] ) , the equations decouple : @xmath73 and @xmath74    it is important to note two things here .",
    "first , the decoupled equations ( [ pnrpad ] ) and ( [ pnrpae ] ) are _ not _ of the same form as eq .",
    "( [ rpaeq ] ) , because @xmath75 unless @xmath57 .",
    "because of this , some of the usual theorems do not immediately apply to ( [ pnrpad ] ) and ( [ pnrpae ] ) , especially regarding the positivity of @xmath29 ( more about this , however , in a moment ) and the sign of @xmath76 .",
    "second , any solution @xmath77 to eq .",
    "( [ pnrpad ] ) with frequency @xmath29 is related to a solution @xmath78 of eq .",
    "( [ pnrpae ] ) with frequency @xmath34 , by @xmath79 , up to some overall phase factor .",
    "this simplifies finding solutions .",
    "let @xmath80 be a solution of eq .",
    "( [ pnrpad ] ) with frequency @xmath81 , which can be positive or negative .",
    "if @xmath82 , and so normalizable to @xmath83 , then let @xmath84 with frequency @xmath85 .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath86 , then let @xmath87 with frequency @xmath88 be the solution to eq .",
    "( [ pnrpae ] ) . in both cases one can normalize to 1 .",
    "what about @xmath38 ?",
    "in like - particle rpa , if exact symmetries are broken by the mean - field , one obtains zero eigenvalues ; the corresponding eigenvectors , which identify the generators of the broken symmetries @xcite , are not normalizable and must be treated with care . for pnrpa , although zero eigenvalues are not excluded , the corresponding eigenvectors do not play a special role and are in fact normalizable , as argued below .",
    "in like - particle rpa , one can show that stability of the mean - field state implies that @xmath89 .",
    "but now in pnrpa one can have @xmath90 , even for @xmath91 . at first glance",
    "this is troubling ; however , we provide two arguments which resolve this apparent paradox .    first , because pnrpa allows charge - changing phonons of the form ( [ crpapn ] ) , one should , at least implicitly , also perform the hartree - fock minimization allowing mixing of proton and neutron states , with @xmath5-@xmath6 fixed by a lagrange multiplier @xmath92 .",
    "( we have in fact done such a calculation , but the results are indistinguishable from fixing @xmath5-@xmath6 by hand , that is , as one varies @xmath92 , @xmath5-@xmath6 makes integral jumps .",
    "nonetheless , the image is useful . )",
    "now the constrained hartree - fock is at a true minimum , and if one considers the eigenfrequencies of ( [ pnrpaeq ] ) all the resultant pnrpa frequencies are proven positive - definite ( although in practice one solves ( [ pnrpad ] ) or ( [ pnrpae ] ) instead ) . to interpret the results as physical transition energies , however , one has to subtract off @xmath93 which leads to negative frequencies .",
    "one can see this directly . by adding the langrange multiplier , one shifts the diagonals of the @xmath26 matrices , @xmath94 and @xmath95 by substituting into eq .",
    "( [ pnrpad ] ) , it is clear one is adding a constant along the entire diagonal , which only shifts @xmath29 to @xmath96 , while the frequencies in eq .",
    "( [ pnrpae ] ) are shifted in the opposite direction .",
    "in fact , for _ any _ value of @xmath92 one only shifts the frequencies and the solutions @xmath97 are manifestly unchanged .",
    "we call this result the shift lemma : by adding the lagrange multiplier one shifts the relative position of the proton and neutron fermi surfaces , but the only result is shifting the absolute value of the pnrpa frequencies .",
    "the relative frequencies and the eigenvectors are unchanged .",
    "there is a useful consequence : if one obtains a zero mode , from the shift lemma one can find a case where the frequency corresponding to the same eigenvector is positive , and one expects the pnrpa vector to be normalizable ; and as the eigenvector is independent of the shift , it is _ always _ always normalizable .",
    "the reader should note that the shift lemma only arises because of the unique isospin dependence of the block decomposition ( [ pnrpaeq ] ) ; no such shift is possible for like - particle rpa because one can not add a constant to the diagonal .",
    "we test the reliability of pnrpa s predictions for gt strengths against exact diagonalization in full @xmath0 sm spaces .",
    "that is , we calculate the gt strength distributions for several nuclei in the @xmath98 ( @xmath99-@xmath100-@xmath101 ) shell on top of an inert @xmath102o core , and two ti isotopes in the @xmath103 ( @xmath104-@xmath105-@xmath106-@xmath107 ) shell above a @xmath108ca core .",
    "while we do not compare directly with experiment , we use in our calculations phenomenological interactions which are very successful in reproducing the experimental data : wildenthal ` usd ' in the @xmath98 shell @xcite , and richter - brown in the @xmath103 shell @xcite .",
    "the shell model diagonalization were performed using a descendent of the glasgow code @xcite , and the shell - model strength distributions using an efficient lanczos moment method @xcite .",
    "having defined the pn - phonon creation operator @xmath109 in ( [ crpapn ] ) , one can calculate the transition matrix element required by eq .",
    "( [ trstr ] ) as @xmath110|\\mathrm{rpa}\\rangle = \\sum_{mi}\\left(x_{mi}^\\lambda(pn / np ) { \\cal o}_{mi}+y_{mi}^\\lambda(pn / np){\\cal o}_{im}\\right).\\ ] ] in our case , @xmath111 is the gt transition operator defined in ( [ defop ] ) , which induces transitions between the correlated ground state of the parent nucleus and the @xmath45 or @xmath46 isobars .",
    "table [ gt ] summarizes results for total transition strengths , centroids and distribution widths , where indeed we find that the pnrpa moments are reasonably close to sm . as a check ,",
    "note that the ikeda sum rule ( [ ikedasr ] ) is fulfilled in both sm and pnrpa , as expected .",
    "we find same features typical of like - particle rpa , that is the pnrpa centroids are usually lower in energy , while the sm distribution widths are larger @xcite .",
    "the latter can be understood as particle - hole correlation beyond rpa which further fragment the distributions .",
    "note that we have results not only for even - z , even - n nuclides but also odd - odd and odd - a , all with comparable success .",
    "( a technical note : in our mean - field calculations , we allow only real wave functions .",
    "this does not have any effect for the even - even nuclei .",
    "for even - odd or odd-@xmath112 nuclei however , the exact mean - field solution could be complex , and we see small symptoms of this restriction : because the rotations with respect to @xmath113 and @xmath114 axes are complex , the proton and neutron number conserving rpa formalism identifies some generators of the broken symmetries as lying at small , but _ not _ zero , excitation energies . while these approximations can be relevant for other transitions @xcite",
    ", they do not have an impact here . )",
    ".total strength @xmath14 , centroid @xmath115 , and width @xmath19 for gt transition operator .",

    "[ ne24][s32 ] illustrate selected results in detail .",
    "these are typical results , neither better nor worse on the average .",
    "these figures follow a useful convention used by many many authors and plot the accumulated sum of the strength , @xmath116 , which allows one to compare by eye the first few moments .",
    "again we see by eye generally good results , for even - even , odd - odd , and odd - a alike .",
    "the major systematic error of rpa appears to be lower centroids for @xmath117 transitions ; why there is no similar lowering of the @xmath118 centroid is unknown .    in figs .",
    "[ ne24 ] and [ mg26 ] we compare @xmath117 calculation against the spherical pnqrpa calculations of lauritzen @xcite , which are similar to those of @xcite .",
    "( all of these papers computed only @xmath117 decay , and only for even - even nuclides . ) in general the qrpa strengths @xmath14 are about twice as much as the exact calculation , and the centroids @xmath16 are significantly lower . the calculations of @xcite found that pnqrpa gives results very similar to shell - model calculations restricted to 2 particle , 2 hole excitation out of the @xmath101 orbit .",
    "this is believeable , as rpa correlations are approximately 2 particle , 2 hole in nature .",
    "by contrast , our pnrpa calculations on top of a deformed hf state do much better . in particular , our deformed pnrpa calculations better approximate the correct total strength than does the spherical pnqrpa .",
    "that deformation can `` quench ''",
    "gamow - teller strength is already known from shell model calculations @xcite .",
    "( see , however , pnqrpa calculations of @xcite , who find the total strength to be insensitive to deformation , although the _ details _ of the distribution they find to be sensitive .",
    "they speculate that the difference is that they include up to 10 harmonic oscillator shells in their calculations , while our calculations and those of @xcite and @xcite are within a single harmonic oscillator shell .",
    "why a multi - shell calculation should be insensitive to deformation is not clear . )",
    "there is a curious exception : the spherical pnqrpa calculation of @xcite on @xmath119 mg yields @xmath14 and @xmath16 with approximately the same accuracy relative to sm results as us .",
    "they only compute the one @xmath117 decay , however , and it is difficult to understand the difference between their methodology and that of @xcite ; furthermore , although in principle all three calculations are using the same shell - model interaction @xcite , which we properly scaled to @xmath120 , we can reproduce lauritzen s shell model results @xcite but not those of @xcite .    in order to further illustrate how important it is to treat correctly deformation , we show in fig .",
    "[ s32 ] three different pnrpa calculations for @xmath121s : with dashed line we represent the distribution strength for a spherical hf state , with dotted line , a distribution obtained by starting with an oblate hf state and with dash - dotted line a distribution obtained starting with a triaxial hf state .",
    "the two deformed states are almost degenerate in energy , the triaxial state being slightly lower . from fig .",
    "[ s32 ] one sees that the strength distribution off the triaxial hf state best approximates the sm result ( as one might expect ) .",
    "qrpa strength distributions which use a starting spherical mean field solution @xcite are slightly more fragmented than in our spherical calculation ( we obtain just one state with @xmath122 ) , but the total strength is about the same in both pnrpa and qrpa , overestimating seriously the sm total strength .",
    "we conclude that using a deformed mean - field solution is at least as important , and arguably more so , than treating pairing with rigor .    in the above discussion",
    "we have focussed on the gross properties of the gamow - teller `` resonance , '' which is the main application of rpa .",
    "but for cold systems , one is often most interested exclusively in low - lying transitions .",
    "as is observable in the figures , our pnrpa calculations are rather mediocre when it comes to the lowest - lying gt transitions : arguably better than pnqrpa , but not very good compared to the exact shell model results .",
    "this is an important caveat for any applications .",

    "we also include the qrpa calculation @xcite ( dotted curve ) ]     transitions in @xmath121s .",
    "the pnrpa was performed on top of a spherical ( dotted curve ) , oblate ( dash - dotted ) , and triaxial ( dashed ) hf state respectively , emphasizing the importance of a correct treatment of deformation for a correct description of the strength distribution . ]",
    "the main purpose of this paper was to investigate the pnrpa s reliability for predicting @xmath125 gt transition strengths ; the motivation is astrophysical applications , where , aside from binding energies and electomagnetic transitions , a good knowledge of week transitions is essential .",
    "our tool in this investigation was the interacting sm which can provide the exact numerical solution in a restricted space .",
    "although we made our tests for nuclides near the bottom of the valley of stability , presumably our results apply out to the driplines ; in fact the major uncertainty will be the shell - model interaction , not the pnrpa .",
    "we show a very good agreement between sm and pnrpa @xmath125 transition distributions in a large number of nuclides in the @xmath98 and @xmath103 shells , similar to high - lying collective electromagnetic transitions investigated in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we obtain better results than spherical pnqrpa , obtaining better suppression of the total strength .",
    "this may seem surprising , as we do not treat rigorously the pairing interaction ; on the other hand , we model correctly the deformation and this proves suitable for describing gt transition strengths .",
    "( because of this , we view tests of pnrpa in schematic models without symmetry breaking @xcite as being inadequate . )",
    "it is possible that a deformed pnqrpa approach , with better treatment of pairing , will lead to further improvement .",
    "we hope however to extend our program to the deformed pnqrpa in the not - so - distant future .",
    "furthermore , it will be important to consider multi - shell spaces , where at least one set of deformed pnqrpa calculations ( not validated by direct shell model calculations , however , due to the enormous size of the model space ) suggest a weaker dependence on deformation @xcite .",
