    "laor et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1997 ) explained the correlation with h@xmath11 fwhm as due to the larger size of a virialized broad emission line region for an agn in a high @xmath12 state .",
    "ebisawa ( 1991 ) found that while the soft component of 6 bhc observed by ginga is roughly stable on time scales of 1 day or less , the hard component exhibits large variations down to msec time scales .",
    "these timescales translates to @xmath13 years and 0.1 day for quasars , if they scale with the mass of the compact object .",
    "the soft component of bhc extends up to @xmath14 kev in bhc in ` soft - high ' states , and it is often associated with optically thick emission from an accretion disk .",
    "if this is the case , the temperature should scale with the mass of the compact object as @xmath15 , and the above energy translates to 0.1 - 0.4 kev for quasars . the rapid large amplitude variability shown by a few narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nlsy1 ) at about 1 kev on timescales of hours to days ( otani 1995 , brandt et al .",
    "1995 , boller et al .",
    "1997 ) can then be analogous to the above bhc hard component flickering .",
    "a steep x - ray spectrum quasar with 10 - 100 times the luminosity of nlsy1s , should be larger and so should vary no more rapidly than several days .",
    "instead fiore et al . ( 1998a ) find that steep x - ray spectrum pg quasars commonly vary by a factor 2 in 1  day .",
    "variability seems therefore correlated with x - ray spectral slope and balmer line width ( and therefore possibly with the accretion rate ) rather than with the luminosity .",
    "evidence for spectral features in the ` 1 kev ' region in many steep soft x - ray quasars is building up ( turner et al .",
    ", 1991 , brandt et al . , 1994 , otani et al . , 1995 , comastri et al . , 1995 , leighly et al . , 1997 , 1998a , b ) . instead ,",
    "` normal ' seyfert 1 galaxies ( having broad balmer lines and flatter soft x - ray spectra ) usually have their strongest absorption features at lower energies ( in the 0.6 - 0.9 kev ` oxygen ' band ) .",
    "an intriguing possibility is that the appearance of these features at different energies also depend on @xmath16 .",
    "detailed high energy x - ray spectra of luminous quasars with steep soft x - ray spectra are essential to understand the ` narrow - broad line ' phenomenon in agn , in particular whether the peculiar x - ray properties depend on optical luminosity , optical - to - x - ray ratio ( @xmath17 ) , or on their eddington ratio . to this end",
    "we selected two bright quasars with @xmath182.0 ( fiore et al . , 1994 ) at the extreme values of optical luminosity , both with low galactic @xmath19 ( table 1 ) of @xmath20 @xmath21 for pg  1244 + 026 , and of @xmath22 @xmath21 for nab0205 + 024 , elvis et al . , 1989 ) and observed them with asca .",
    "we report the results in this paper .",

    "however , the presence of a cold absorber of thickness @xmath28 @xmath21 is inconsistent with the pspc spectrum ( probability @xmath29 ) , while the presence of an edge at 0.62 kev with @xmath30 is only marginally consistent with the pspc result .",
    "the asca observations of pg1244 + 026 and nab0205 + 024 have shown that the x - ray continuum of these two quasars flattens by 0.5 - 1 passing from the 0.1 - 2 kev ( pspc ) to the 2 - 10 kev band .",
    "similar results were obtained by brandt , mathur & elvis ( 1997 ) ; and by comastri et al .",

    "( 1998b ) on akn564 .",
    "it appears that the x - ray spectrum of a sizeable number of steep pspc and narrow balmer line quasars has significant curvature , being flatter at higher energies .",
    "this could be due to different components influencing the spectrum at different energies , as might happen in ` normal ' broad lines seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars , where a soft component is often present .",
    "the relative intensity of the two components would be quite different from ` normal ' quasars .",
    "laor et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggested a fainter hard component relative to the optical in the majority of low redshift pg quasars ( assuming a two component model ) .",
    "however , grupe ( 1996 ) found evidence for a stronger soft excess in a sample of soft x - ray selected seyferts dominated by narrow - line objects .",
    "a large relative intensity of the soft component has important consequences on various competing models for the soft component .",
    "disc reprocessing models ( matt et al . 1993 , fiore et al . 1997 ) would require highly anisotropic emission to account for the discrepancy between the observed soft and hard fluxes",
    ". optically thin free - free emission ( e.g. barvainis 1993 ) is ruled out by these observations because the best fit power law slope is still too steep to fit the spectrum above 4 kev , because variability rules out optically thin plasma ( elvis et al .",
    "1991 ) and because of the implausibly low metal abundances ( @xmath31 solar , see table 3 ) required in nab0205 + 024 ( see sect .",
    "the most likely origin for the steep component is comptonized disc emission ( e.g. czerny & elvis 1987 , fiore et al .",
    "1995 , pounds et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the high energy spectral index of the two quasars @xmath32 ( see table 3 ) is consistent with that of ` normal ' seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. nandra & pounds 1994 , nandra et al .",
    "the error on @xmath33 is however large and so no strong conclusion can be drawn on the origin of the hard emission .",
    "an answer to this question must await the large area and high energy sensitivity of axaf , xmm and spectrum x - gamma .",
    "the @xmath34 kev feature in pg1244 + 026 could be explained in terms of either a broad ( @xmath35 kev ) emission line at 0.91 kev ( 0.95 kev quasar frame ) of about 60 ev equivalent width or a @xmath36 absorption edge at 1.17 kev ( or an absorption notch at 1.22 kev ) .",
    "these possibilities can not be discriminated between on statistical grounds .",
    "an absorption interpretation requires additional low energy absorption , either cold ( with a column density higher than galactic by @xmath37 @xmath21 ( see tables 4 and 5 ) , in contrast with the pspc results , or a warm absorber with a peculiar ion abundance distribution .",
    "the observed spectrum can be interpreted in terms of either an inflowing ( v / c=0.25 ) or an outflowing ( v / c=0.33 ) absorber . in the first case the ion contributing most to the absorption is fexviii , in the second case it is oviii .",
    "the two cases can not be discriminated on statistical grounds . while an outflowing absorber has been suggested in several other cases ( see e.g. mathur et al .",
    "1994 ) , this would be the first case for an inflowing highly ionized absorber .",
    "a similar situation is found in iras 13224 - 3809 by otani et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , in akn564 by brandt et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and by leighly et al .",
    "( 1998a ) .",
    "otani et al ( 1995 ) and leighly et al . ( 1997 ) interpret the features in the 12 kev band in terms of blueshifted absorption from relativistically ( v=0.2 - 0.6 c ) outflowing material .",
    "if the 1.17 kev feature in pg1244 + 026 is due to a blueshifted oviii photoelectric absorption , then the absorption seen below 0.64 kev may be due to cvi photoelectric absorption from the same gas .",
    "this distribution is far from an equilibrium distribution ( see eg .",
    "nicastro et al .",
    "1998 ) , not an impossible situation considering the large variability observed in this source .",
    "the absorption features seen between 1 and 2 kev may also be interpreted in terms of resonant lines ( e.g. leighly et al . 1997 ) . if the ion producing the absorption is oxygen oviii ( resonant line at 0.65 kev ) , the best fit notch energy of 1.22 kev ( quasar frame ) implies a very high gas velocity : 0.56c .",
    "fe xviii ( e=0.87 kev ) or fe xvii ( e=0.81 kev ) can also contribute to the absorption , because of their high oscillator strengths , 1.7 , 0.6 respectively ( kato et al .",
    "1976 ) , and abundances .",
    "if the 1.22 kev absorption notch is due to these ions then the velocity of the outflowing gas will be smaller , 0.33c .",
    "in any case , in the blueshifted absorption scenario the gas is outflowing at velocities which are a sizeable fraction of c , reminiscent of blobs of gas in jets .",
    "it is interesting to note that similar absorption features have been observed in blazars ( e.g. pks2155 - 304 , canizares & kruper , 1884 , other bllacs , madejski et al .",
    "1991 , 3c273 , grandi et al . 1997 ) , but usually below 1 kev .",
    "somewhat surprisingly this implies less extreme conditions in these radio - loud objects than in our radio - quiet quasars .",
    "high redshift radio loud quasars may have similar jet - related absorption too ( elvis et al .",
    ", 1997 ) .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the 1 kev feature is in terms of an emission line due to highly ionized oxygen , neon ( neix ) and/or to iron l. there are two possible origin for this line : recombination in an optically thin thermal plasma , or  reflection \" in photoionized matter .",
    "a thermal plasma is highly implausible on physical grounds ( elvis et al .",
    "1991 , fiore et al .",
    "emission measure is @xmath3810@xmath39 @xmath40 , for a spherical source ( with radius @xmath41 ) and constant electron density @xmath42 , @xmath43 @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath44 cm from the observed x - ray variability , @xmath4510@xmath46 @xmath40 , this implies an electron scattering optical depth @xmath47 . with such values",
    "a thermal plasma is no longer optically thin .",
    "the situation is even worse if the matter is clumpy , as the density of each cloud must be greater .",
    "the second possibility is that the ` 1 kev ' emitting matter is photoionized by the central nucleus .",
    "we can assume that the gas is not covering the source because there is not significant ovii and/or oviii absorption .",
    "we therefore assume that we are not observing a  warm absorber \" , but rather a `` warm reflector '' .",
    "this could either be a warm absorber viewed from its side , in which case the matter would be optically thin to thomson scattering ; or the accretion disc , and the matter would be thick .",
    "since both the `` reflector '' and the primary emission ( which provides most of the continuum ) are observed , the optically thick case gives the highest values of the equivalent width .",
    "however , even in the optically thick case the expected ews can barely account for the observed values ( see below ) ; hence we neglect the optically thin case altogether .    the observed line ( which is significantly broad ) may be a blend of several lines ( see for instance ycki et al .",
    "1994 , netzer 1997 ) .",
    "the observed energy suggests the 0.92 kev ne ix and 1.02 kev ne x recombination lines , the 0.87 kev oxygen viii recombination ( to ground state ) line and the iron l ( around 0.8 kev ) lines being the most important .",
    "none of these lines alone can account for the observed ew : for instance , the maximum value ( i.e. for a face  on disk with a intervening ion fraction @xmath48 ) for the ne ix line is about 10 ev , while that of the oxygen recombination line is about 15 ev ( note that a o viii k@xmath49 recombination line at 0.65 kev with a similar ew should also be present ; the 90% upper limit on such a line is 30 ev ) .",
    "these values have been calculated using the formulae of basko ( 1978 ) , and assuming a reasonable ionization structure .",
    "( in the disc hypothesis an iron k@xmath49 line at 6.5 - 6.9 kev is also expected , but the upper limit of 300 - 400 ev does not exclude the presence of such a line . ) allowing for a possible factor of 2 neon and/or iron overabundance ( an oxygen overabundance would decrease the ne line while not increasing the o line ) and/or anisotropy of the illuminating radiation , the observed equivalent width could be explained ( note that in many seyfert 1 galaxies the iron k@xmath49 line is also stronger than expected , suggesting iron overabundance or anisotropic illumination ) .    in this scenario",
    "the ` 1 kev ' feature may arise from an highly ionized accretion disk . in the matt et al .",
    "( 1993 ) models high ionization is mainly due to a high accretion rates ( the ionization parameter depends on @xmath50 ) . the detection of these emission lines in steep soft x - ray quasars would then be further evidence of high @xmath16 . we note that since recombination can occur only in highly ionized atoms , we would not expect features of this kind in ` normal ' quasars , as their disc should be much less ionized , as in fact observed .",
    "the strong dependence of the ionization parameter on @xmath51 allows for large differences in the ionization structure against small differences in @xmath51 and therefore that the ` 1 kev ' feature may not be ubiquitous in nlsy1s .",
    "indeed , a similar feature is not present in nab0205 + 024 . a line with the same equivalent width as in pg1244 + 026 ( 60 ev ) would have been detected in the nab0205 + 024 sis spectrum ( the 90 % upper limit is only 20 ev ) . in the accretion disc scenario",
    "this would imply a different ionization state ( higher or lower ) of the matter or a significant metal underabundance in nab0205 + 024 .",
    "the mean 0.5 - 10 kev luminosity measured by asca in pg1244 + 026 and nab0205 + 024 differs by an order of magnitude : @xmath1 and @xmath3 erg s@xmath2 respectively ( assuming isotropic emission , @xmath4 = 50.0 and @xmath5 = 0.0 ) .",
    "the optical ( 3000  ) monochromatic luminosities differs even more : @xmath52 and @xmath53 erg s@xmath2 respectively .",
    "the variations seen in the nab0205 + 024 light curve imply an efficiency in the conversion of matter into radiation greater than 1.6 % ( e.g. fabian 1984 ) .",
    "taken at face value , this excludes thermonuclear reactions as the origin of the observed x - ray luminosity for which the upper limit on the efficiency is in this case about 0.7 % .",
    "the similar variability observed in the two quasars agrees with the fiore et al .",
