    "the study of @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians  @xcite-@xcite has largely concentrated on eigenvalue problems in which the wave function is required to vanish at infinity in various stokes wedges .",
    "however , some work has also been done on sturm - liouville problems defined on a finite interval  @xcite , where the wave - function is required to vanish at the end points .",
    "such problems , especially with the potential @xmath6 , are relevant to a number of physical situations  @xcite-@xcite . in a previous paper  @xcite",
    "we showed that for the imaginary linear potential and for potentials of the form @xmath7 , the wkb approximation with the wkb path passing through a single turning point gives a spectacularly good picture of the spectrum , even for low energies .",
    "in particular , it correctly locates the critical points , where pairs of real eigenvalues merge and become complex conjugates of one other .",
    "however , for the potential @xmath8 the method failed to produce critical points , and the question of whether a different wkb path could do so was not addressed . for the @xmath9 potential",
    "there are three turning points , and an alternative path passes through a pair of @xmath0-symmetric turning points .    in the present paper",
    "we develop the formalism for such a path and show in sec .",
    "ii that the two - turning - point wkb approximation gives a surprisingly simple secular equation . in sec .",
    "iii we demonstrate that this approximation accurately reproduces the full structure of the spectrum for @xmath8 .",
    "the method is also shown to give good results for higher - power potentials of the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is integral . when the method is applied to potentials with half - integral powers of @xmath5 , the double - valued nature of the potential",
    "must be taken into account .",
    "we reproduce the spectrum when there exists a simple path that passes through the turning points and remains on the first riemann sheet . in sec .",
    "iv we give some brief concluding remarks .",
    "we consider the eigenvalue equation @xmath12 defined on the interval @xmath13 $ ] , with dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath14 . in",
    "what follows we take @xmath15 without loss of generality because @xmath15 can be obtained by rescaling for the monomial potentials @xmath16 that we consider .",
    "the equation and the boundary conditions are @xmath0 symmetric , so we expect real eigenvalues when the @xmath0 symmetry is unbroken ; that is , when the wave functions are themselves @xmath0 symmetric .",
    "when the @xmath0 symmetry is broken , the eigenvalues occur in complex - conjugate pairs .    with @xmath17",
    "the equation becomes @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is considered as a fixed parameter . for large",
    "@xmath21 the wkb approximation to @xmath22 has the form @xmath23.\\ ] ] however , the path connecting @xmath24 to @xmath25 is not specified .",
    "if it goes directly from @xmath24 to @xmath25 without passing through a turning point , @xmath22 has the same form along the path .",
    "then , by imposing the boundary conditions @xmath26 , one obtains the standard no - turning - point approximation @xmath27 where @xmath28",
    ". the eigenvalues are then obtained from this secular equation , which always gives real eigenvalues and predicts no degeneracies ( critical points ) in the spectrum .",
    "when , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the path goes through a single turning point on the imaginary axis at @xmath29 , the wave function has different coefficients to the left and to the right of the turning point .",
    "these coefficients are determined by matching asymptotically the separate wkb approximations to the airy functions that approximate the solution to the schrdinger equation in the vicinity of the turning point . in that case",
    "the resulting secular equation is found to be @xmath30 where @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "because of @xmath0 symmetry , the total integral @xmath33 can be written as @xmath34 .",
    "it is the presence of the second term in this new secular equation that gives the interesting structure and critical points of the spectrum .",
    "when @xmath35 is real , @xmath36 is real and intrinsically large in magnitude .",
    "when @xmath36 is negative , the second term is generically very small , so that the equation essentially reduces to ( [ 0tp ] ) ; when @xmath36 is positive , the second term is generically large and can not be balanced by the first term unless @xmath35 becomes complex .",
    "the critical points where this change of behaviour occurs are given by @xmath37 .",
    "in the case of the potential @xmath8 there are three turning points at @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 . numerical calculations  @xcite show a series of critical points , which the one - turning - point wkb approximation fails to reproduce .",
    "we are therefore motivated to develop the formalism for a two - turning - point approximation , where the path of integration passes through the turning points @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in this case",
    "we need three different wkb approximations to the wave function : @xmath43 for @xmath5 between @xmath24 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 for @xmath5 between @xmath44 and @xmath46 , and @xmath47 for @xmath5 between @xmath46 and 1 .",
    "these approximations take the form _",
    "l(x)&~ & , & & _",
    "m(x ) & ~ & , & & _ r(x)&~ & .",
    "we will not need @xmath47 explicitly , as our tactic will be to work with @xmath43 and @xmath45 in the left half - plane and to enforce @xmath0 symmetry of the wave function on the imaginary axis .",
    "the first constraint on the coefficients is that @xmath43 should vanish at @xmath48 , which gives the equation @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "the second constraint comes from requiring that the wave function be @xmath0 symmetric , namely , that @xmath51 be pure imaginary at an arbitrary point @xmath52 on the imaginary axis .",
    "after some algebra this leads to the equation @xmath53 where @xmath54 .    finally , we match the two wkb approximations to the superposition of airy functions @xmath55 with @xmath56 , that approximates the solution to the schrdinger equation in the vicinity of @xmath44 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath57 is given by @xmath58 , where @xmath59^{1/3}$ ] and @xmath60 . because @xmath21 is large , @xmath57 is small .",
    "hence , @xmath61 is large , and the airy functions have two distinct asymptotic behaviours depending on the argument of @xmath61 , namely [ airy ] ai(y)&~ & e^-y^3/2(|arg  y|<),(y)&~ & ( e^-y^3/2+ie^y^3/2)(|arg  y|= ) . in the neighbourhood of @xmath44",
    "the two wkb approximations can be further approximated as _",
    "l(x ) & & ( l_1 e^- y^3/2+l_2 e^y^3/2),&&_m(x ) & & ( m_1 e^y^3/2+m_2 e^-y^3/2 ) .    in the complex-@xmath61 plane the matches must be made along the stokes lines where the wave function is purely oscillatory .",
    "these stokes lines are indicated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ matching ] .",
    "the rotation angle between @xmath5 and @xmath61 is @xmath62 , which is approximately @xmath63 , and the paths have to be adjusted so that @xmath61 and @xmath64 lie on stokes lines .",
    "the required directions in the complex-@xmath5 plane are indicated in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ matching ] .",
    "-plane ( left panel ) and @xmath5-plane ( right panel ) . , title=\"fig : \" ] -plane ( left panel ) and @xmath5-plane ( right panel ) .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    for the matching to @xmath45 , both @xmath61 and @xmath64 lie away from the negative-@xmath61 axis .",
    "thus , in this case we can use the first asymptotic approximation of ( [ airy ] ) .",
    "this results in the matching @xmath65 and leads to the condition @xmath66 for the matching to @xmath43 , @xmath64 again lies away from the negative-@xmath61 axis , but @xmath61 lies along that axis . in that case we use the second approximation of ( [ airy ] ) for ai(@xmath61 ) .",
    "the resulting match is @xmath67 which gives the condition @xmath68    combining ( [ c1 ] ) , ( [ c2 ] ) , ( [ c3 ] ) and ( [ c4 ] ) , we obtain @xmath69 which results in the surprisingly simple secular equation @xmath70 where @xmath71 .    the secular equation ( [ 2tp ] ) is our main result .",
    "it was derived explicitly for the case @xmath8 , but in fact it applies without change for potentials of the form @xmath72 when the two relevant turning points lie in the lower - half plane . if the relevant turning points lie in the upper - half plane , the sign of @xmath36 in ( [ 2tp ] ) should be reversed .",
    "when @xmath11 is an integer , the spectrum is the same for @xmath21 negative because changing the sign of @xmath21 is equivalent to changing the sign of @xmath73 .",
    "otherwise , the spectrum is asymmetric in @xmath21 .",
    "a few words about the role of @xmath36 are in order .",
    "as already mentioned , it is the change in sign of @xmath36 that produces the interesting structure in the spectrum and determines the location of the critical points .",
    "the significance of @xmath74 is that when @xmath36 vanishes , @xmath75 is purely real and there is a purely oscillatory path for the wkb wave function in going from @xmath48 to @xmath76 . there is a path connecting @xmath44 and @xmath46 along which the wave function is purely oscillatory , so the wave function is oscillatory along the entire path from -1 to 1 .",
    "if there is no oscillatory path starting from @xmath48 that passes through @xmath44 , the wkb approximation fails to produce critical points .",
    "these considerations guide us in the choice of the appropriate turning points .",
    "for @xmath3 the two relevant turning points are shown circled in fig .",
    "[ ix3tp ] for @xmath77 .",
    "we also show the stokes lines emanating from @xmath44 and @xmath46 along which the exponent in the wkb approximation is purely imaginary .",
    "there is a purely oscillatory path between @xmath44 and @xmath46 , and the continuations towards @xmath78 almost pass through those points .",
    "they do so when @xmath74 .     with @xmath77 .",
    "the two turning points used in the wkb approximation are circled and marked @xmath44 and @xmath46 . also shown ( dashed green lines ) are the stokes lines emanating from @xmath44 and @xmath46 . ]",
    "figure [ ix3 ] shows the result of ( [ 2tp ] ) for the real spectrum of the potential @xmath3 along with the numerical results obtained by a shooting method .",
    "as can be seen , the wkb approximation reproduces the numerical result very accurately .",
    "the blue dots extending a little way beyond a critical point represent the common real part of the complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues .",
    "the spectrum for @xmath21 negative is not shown because it is identical to that for @xmath21 positive .",
    "compared with the numerical results ( blue dots ) .",
    "the wkb approximation and the numerical results are virtually indistinguishable . ]    figures [ ix5tp ] and [ ix5 ] show the corresponding results for the potential @xmath79 .",
    "because the relevant turning points are above the real-@xmath5 axis , we must now use @xmath80 in ( [ 2tp ] ) .",
    "again , the wkb approximation reproduces the numerical result extremely accurately .",
    "a general feature of the spectrum is that as the power @xmath81 of @xmath5 increases , the interesting structure occurs for higher values of @xmath21 .",
    "this is readily understood because the problem is initially posed in the range @xmath82 .     with @xmath77 .",
    "the two turning points used in the wkb approximation are circled and marked @xmath44 and @xmath46 . also shown ( dashed green lines )",

    "as in fig .",
    "[ ix3 ] , the wkb approximation and the numerical results are virtually indistinguishable . ]",
    "it seems clear that this wkb approximation will work equally well for potentials of the form @xmath83 , where @xmath11 is integral .",
    "the turning points chosen are probably those closest to the @xmath5-axis , but in any case they must be a pair for which the stokes lines from @xmath44 and @xmath46 pass through @xmath84 for some value of @xmath20 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath74 and the onset of structure in the spectrum , resulting in critical points .",
    "we have also examined the effectiveness of the wkb approximation for half - integral @xmath0-symmetric potentials .",
    "specifically we have looked at the cases @xmath85 for @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "now we have to differentiate between the cases @xmath21 positive and @xmath21 negative .    starting with @xmath89 ,",
    "the potential is a two - sheeted function with a cut that we take to lie along the positive imaginary axis .",
    "there is a single turning point , which is located at @xmath90 , but it is on different riemann sheets depending on the sign of @xmath21 . for @xmath91",
    "the turning point is on the first sheet ; however , for @xmath92 it is on the second sheet .",
    "it is natural to take the end points @xmath84 to be on the first riemann sheet .",
    "then , for @xmath91 there is a straightforward wkb path through the turning point . on the other hand , for @xmath92 the path would have to pass through the cut twice in order to pass through the turning point .",
    "we do not know how to implement such a path , so for @xmath92 we simply use the straightforward no - turning - point formula of ( [ 0tp ] ) . by its nature",
