    "[ intro ] driven by applications in coating technology , micro and nano structuring of soft matter layers , and , in general , the development of ( multi-)functional surfaces the understanding of thin films of simple and complex fluids is of growing importance .",
    "recent years have seen on the one hand major advances in experimental techniques of preparation and analysis and on the other hand intense developments of the theoretical description of the statics and dynamics of homogeneous and structured films.@xcite the dynamics of the structuring often represents examples for micro- and nano - fluidic flows , a present focus of interest in its own right .",
    "@xcite    for thin one - layer free surface films of one - component simple or polymeric liquids experimental results @xcite and theoretical understanding @xcite are well developed .",
    "however , experiments increasingly focus on complex situations like the evolution of multilayer films of partially miscible @xcite or immiscible @xcite liquids , complex fluids like polymer blends that might undergo dewetting _ or / and _ decomposition @xcite or solutions of polymers , nanoparticles , colloids or polymer blends with interacting convective motion , phase separation , evaporation / condensation and evolving rheology . @xcite theoretical descriptions exist , however , only for a small part of the experimentally known complex scenario and phenomena involving free surface thin films .",
    "recent advances include a fully nonlinear thin film description in long wave approximation for two layers of immiscible liquids under air @xcite and between two plates , @xcite the analysis of the dewetting behaviour on chemically or topographically heterogeneous substrates,@xcite the study of the dynamics of depinning of a driven drop on a heterogeneous substrate,@xcite the description of films with surface active nanoparticles,@xcite the inclusion of evaporation / condensation in the thin film description.@xcite    thin films of polymer blends are one of the simplest complex systems listed above and extensive experimental results can be found in the literature .",
    "@xcite described effects include the dependency of the evolving structure ( stratified bi- or tri - layer structure that is laterally homogeneous ; purely lateral phase separation , checkerboard structure ) on substrate properties,@xcite surface roughening or film morphology changes during phase separation , @xcite surface directed spinodal decomposition , @xcite subsequent vertical phase separation and dewetting , @xcite and surface phase inversion.@xcite the influence of heterogeneous substrates was also studied.@xcite however , as detailed below to our knowledge there exists no theoretical description of the involved processes that takes into account the evolving composition of the mixture _ and _ the evolving surface profile of the film .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to present such a description based on the underlying transport equations . to cover the coupled time evolution of the film thickness and concentration profiles one has to supplement the coupled transport equations for momentum and concentration by appropriate boundary conditions at the free surface and at the solid substrate .",
    "two groups of studies are present in the literature that address part of the involved questions . on the one hand ,",
    "the classical cahn - hilliard model @xcite describing purely diffusive decomposition of a binary mixture was studied for films in a gap between two solid plates.@xcite at the plates boundary conditions prescribe zero diffusive flow through the plates , energetic preference of the plates for one component and an enforced ( or reduced ) demixing at the plates .",
    "however , such a model can in principle not account for an evolving surface deflection in decomposing films as observed in phase - separating polymer blends on homogeneous @xcite or patterned @xcite substrates .",
    "an evolving film profile is _ by definition _ related to a convective flow of the mixture .    on the other hand , the coupling of momentum and concentration transport for weakly miscible fluids ( i.e.  decomposing mixtures ) is well studied for bulk systems using the so - called model - h .",
    "@xcite it couples the convective cahn - hilliard equation and the navier - stokes equations ammended by a concentration dependent stress tensor , the so called korteweg stresses.@xcite for a survey of the history see ref .  .",
    "a variant of model - h is also used for the dynamics of momentum and density of a single component near a liquid - gas phase transition in isothermal @xcite or non - isothermal conditions .",
    "@xcite two - phase liquids and binary mixtures between two solid plates are also investigated.@xcite a similar model for miscible liquids was studied , for instance , in refs . and . there",
    "the convective cahn - hilliard equation is replaced by a normal convective diffusion equation .",
    "nowadays , model - h is also applied to multiphase flows in closed micro channels of different geometries ( straight quadratic channel , @xcite t - junction .",
    "@xcite )    to describe a film of a mixture under air , model - h is used to describe the dynamics within the film , i.e.  modelling the creation and evolution of internal diffuse interfaces within the film .",
    "the bulk model has to be completed by boundary conditions at the solid substrate ( discussed in refs .  ) _ and _ by boundary conditions at the free surface .",
    "the latter represents an external sharp interface .",
    "the interaction of the internal diffuse interfaces with the external sharp one via a solutal marangoni effect results in an additional driving force of the evolution .",
    "other related work involves an ad - hoc lubrication approximation model coupling evolution equations for the film thickness and the mean concentration in the film.@xcite we believe that such a model might be correct in the limit of weak vertical variation of concentration but is not able to describe vertically stratified films and their evolution .",
    "an alternative approach uses microscopic discrete models like lattice gas ( for results on a binary alloy see ref .  ) or molecular dynamics.@xcite this leads , however , often to a strong restriction in length- and time - scales that can be studied .",
    "we present our work as a sequence of papers .",
    "the present first part derives and discusses the basic transport equations and analyses steady base states .",
    "the accompanying second part performs a detailed stability analysis with respect to transversal instability modes for the various qualitatively different base states .",
    "thereby the consequences of convective transport are studied in detail and the sequence of patterning processes is predicted .",
    "a planned further sequel will focus on the nonlinear evolution .",
    "the present paper is structured as follows . in section  [ dermh ]",
    "we derive the coupled transport equations for momentum , density and temperature in the framework of phenomenological non - equilibrium thermodynamics . after discussing the physical interpretation of the individual contributions representing , for instance , an internal soret effect ( i.e.  soret effect for the internal diffuse interface ) and internal interface viscosity , the model is simplified assuming an isothermal setting , vanishing interface viscosity and internal energies resulting from a setting close to the critical point of demixing .",
    "the resulting model - h is compared to versions found in the literature discussing the issue of defining pressure and chemical potential .",
    "section  [ sec - bc ] introduces boundary conditions at the rigid solid substrate and the free interface .",
    "it is explained in detail why the incorporation of convective flow is a necessary precondition to describe evolving surface deflections .",
    "next , sections  [ sec - nondim ] and  [ sec - en ] introduce the non - dimensionalization and local energies , respectively .",
    "homogeneous and vertically stratified , transversally homogeneous steady state solutions are analysed in section  [ sec - base ] .",
    "the final section  [ sec - conc ] summarizes , compares to the literature and gives an outlook on the sequel .",
    "the appendix  [ deribc ] uses variational calculus to independently derive the boundary conditions in the static limiting case .",
    "[ dermh ] first we present a derivation of an extended model - h that accounts for all cross couplings of the transport equations for momentum , concentration and temperature .",
    "this includes soret- and dufour - effects with nonlinear coefficients and interface viscosity for the diffuse interface .",
    "it follows in spirit the derivations of the navier - stokes equations given in refs .. the online version shows new terms related to the concentration field in red .",

    "the model has been simplified for isothermal setting , vanishing interface viscosity and internal energies resulting from a setting close to the critical point of demixing .",
    "a comparison with literature results has clarified the issue of defining pressure and chemical potential .    to facilitate the description of a free surface profile we have introduced boundary conditions at the solid substrate and the free interface .",
    "it has been explained that the incorporation of hydrodynamic flow even in the case of extremely slow creeping flow is a necessary precondition for the description of evolving surface deflections .",
    "it has been shown that the dimensionless numbers entering the boundary conditions for the cahn - hilliard and the korteweg - navier - stokes are closely related .",
    "therefore they can not by any means be chosen independently of each other .",

    "it has been shown that a plethora of stratified solutions exist that can be mapped , ordered and understood using continuation techniques and symmetry arguments .",
    "the obtained systematics will form the basis for the analysis of the lateral stability of the base states undertaken in an accompanying paper .",

    "most of the results on vertical layering reviewed in @xcite can be explained at least qualitatively .",

    "the here observed change in the layering of lowest energy corresponds well to the experiments .    to conclude",
    ", the present work has presented a complete model to investigate a wide variety of systems involving the coupled evolution of surface and concentration profiles of free surface films of a decomposing mixture .",
    "it can be used to analyse vertically stratified but horizontally homogeneous films and their evolution in time .",
    "this includes layer inversions of two - layer systems with diffuse or sharp interfaces that can not be described by two - layer models for immiscible liquids .",
    "@xcite the dynamics of such an inversion is quite complex .",
    "for instance , for a substrate / liquid  1/liquid  2/air two - layer structure it involves the transient formation of drops of liquid  1 at the liquid  2/air interface .",
