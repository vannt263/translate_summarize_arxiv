    "it is well known that low - temperature transport in disordered one - dimensional ( 1d ) structures is distinguished by large mesoscopic fluctuations .",
    "such fluctuations have been measured  @xcite even in samples of considerable length .",
    "they arise from the interplay of localization and rigid geometrical constraints on possible current paths .",
    "the total resistance tends to be dominated by a few strong obstacles  `` breaks ''  which occur at random due to disorder in the sample .",
    "@xcite this unusual behavior can be contrasted with a more familiar case of dimensions @xmath0 . there",
    "the current can go around the breaks , so that the mesoscopic fluctuations of transport properties are usually small and self - averaging .",
    "in this paper we consider 1d systems that are not too short , so that the coherent tunneling of electrons through their entire length  @xcite is extremely improbable .",
    "instead , electrons traverse each sample via a sequence of many incoherent tunneling acts  the variable - range hopping  @xcite ( vrh ) . by studying the vrh transport",
    "@xcite one aims to extract information about the nature of electron localization and disorder in the system .",
    "however , this task is far from trivial .",
    "although the basic physics of the 1d vrh problem is quite well understood , experimental studies of vrh are typically done in a narrow parameter range where usual theoretical approximations are still rather crude .",
    "below we demonstrate that large corrections appear when the transport properties of a standard vrh model are calculated numerically , which means , with fewer approximations .    to deal with large mesoscopic fluctuations we follow prior work and compute both the probability distribution functions  @xcite ( pdf ) and suitable averages of the transport observables .",
    "for example , we study the ensemble - averaged conductance @xmath1 , which can be measured experimentally by having a large number of 1d wires connected in parallel .",
    "@xcite    our primary purpose is to investigate non - ohmic effects , e.g. , the dependence of function @xmath2 on the electric force @xmath3 .",
    "this regime has been studied much less compared to the ohmic one .",
    "however , recently an analytical theory of non - ohmic 1d vrh has been proposed in a work of one of us .",
    "@xcite here we approach the same problem numerically .",
    "we have developed an efficient computer algorithm , which is able to find the vrh conductance of a given sample at arbitrary electric field . by choosing a low @xmath4",

    "@xcite    in 1d , the mott and efros - shklovskii exponents coincide .",
    "this is because in 1d the @xmath12 coulomb potential is only marginally long - range to begin with , and then typically also screened by a nearby metallic gate .",
    "the importance of the remaining interactions is determined by the dimensionless parameter @xmath13 which has the physical meaning of the dielectric constant . here",
    "@xmath14 is the capacitance to the gate per unit length of the wire and @xmath15 is the average density of states .",
    "( note that @xmath16 is related to the luttinger - liquid parameter  @xcite of a disorder - free 1d system . ) in this paper we study the case of weak interactions , @xmath17 , where , naively , the mott law may seem to be a reasonable starting point .    actually , the 1d mott law is modified by the aforementioned mesoscopic fluctuations .",

    "such behavior has been confirmed by numerical simulations ,  @xcite so it is considered well established .    nevertheless , to establish a reference point for our study of non - ohmic vrh we examined the _",

    "while we do not know the origin of this discrepancy , it is possible that the different behavior seen in the two experiments is just another example of a dilemma , which has a long history in the vrh literature .",
    "previously , it was discussed mostly in the context of bulk materials where majority of experiments have been done so far . however , it is tempting to make a comparison with our 1d case because the vrh exponent of the efros - shklovskii law in any dimension nominally coincides with the 1d mott law exponent @xmath11 .",
    "the essence of the dilemma is as follows .",
    "there are a number of systems where non - ohmic behavior does follow eqs .   and that we have observed in our simulations . however , this is usually the case when parameter @xmath7 in eq .",
    "is large , say , tens or hundreds of k. very different and still poorly understood behavior occurs when @xmath26 is relatively small ( according to one study ,  @xcite when @xmath269 ) .",
