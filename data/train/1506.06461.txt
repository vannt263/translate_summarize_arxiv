    "the nuclear incompressibility parameter @xmath7 defined for symmetric nuclear matter ( snm ) at saturation density @xmath8 stands out as an irreducible element of physical reality .",
    "it has an umbilical association with the isoscalar giant monopole resonances ( isgmr ) in microscopic nuclei ; it also underlies in a proper understanding of supernova explosion in the cosmic domain @xcite . from careful microscopic analysis of isgmr energies with suitably constructed energy density functional ( edf ) @xmath9 in a non relativistic framework as applicable to finite and infinite nuclear systems",
    ", its value had initially been fixed at @xmath10mev @xcite . in microscopic relativistic approaches on the other hand ,",
    "a higher value of @xmath7 @xmath11 mev was obtained @xcite .",
    "after several revisions from different corners , however , its value settled to @xmath12 mev @xcite .",
    "it gives good agreement with the experimentally determined centroids of isgmr , in particular , for @xmath13pb , @xmath14zr and @xmath15sm nuclei , calculated both with non - relativistic @xcite and relativistic @xcite energy density functionals .",
    "the near - settled problem was , however , left open with the apparent incompatibility of the said value of @xmath7 with the recent isgmr data for sn and cd - isotopes @xcite .",
    "these nuclei showed remarkable softness towards compression , the isgmr data appeared explained best with @xmath16200 mev @xcite .",
    "a plausible explanation was recently put forward by khan @xmath17 @xcite for the apparent discrepancy .",
    "it is argued that there may not be an unique relation between the value of @xmath7 associated with an effective force and the monopole energy of a nucleus predicted by the force @xcite .",
    "the region between the center and the surface of the nucleus is the most sensitive towards displaying the compression as manifested in the isgmr .",
    "the isgmr centroid @xmath18 is related to the integral of incompressibility @xmath19 over the whole density range @xcite . as a result",
    ", a larger value of @xmath5 for a given edf can be compensated by lower values of @xmath20 at sub - saturation densities so as to predict a similar value of isgmr energy in nuclei .",
    "it is seen that the incompressibility @xmath21 calculated with a multitude of energy density functionals when plotted against density cross close to a single density point @xcite , this universality possibly arising from the constraints encoded in the edf from empirical nuclear observables .",
    "this crossing density @xmath22 $ ] @xcite seems more relevant as an indicator for the isgmr centroid . because of the incompressibility integral",
    ", the centroid seems more intimately correlated to the derivative of the compression modulus ( defined as @xmath23 ) at the crossing density rather than to @xmath7 .",
    "the value of @xmath24 is seen to be @xmath25 mev @xcite . from various functionals , the calculated values of @xmath26",
    "are found to be linearly correlated with the correspondingly calculated values of isgmr centroids for @xmath13pb and also for @xmath27sn . from the known experimental isgmr data for these nuclei , a value of @xmath281050 @xmath29100 mev @xcite is then obtained , revised from an earlier estimate of @xmath30 mev @xcite . using a further assumption of a linear correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath18 calculated from different edf ,",
    "a value for @xmath7 @xmath31230 mev with an uncertainty of @xmath3140 mev is reported , the uncertainty being inferred from the spread of @xmath7 values obtained with the different functionals used .    the universality of the crossing point @xmath2 and the values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be readily acknowledged ; @xmath33 is seen to be well correlated to @xmath18 .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient @xmath34 @xcite of @xmath33 with @xmath18 for @xmath27sn is 0.80 and is 0.94 for @xmath13pb .",
    "however , assumption of a linear correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath18 may not be justified , they seem to be very weakly correlated ( @xmath34=0.67 for @xmath27sn and 0.79 for @xmath13pb ) @xcite . the inferred value of incompressibility around saturation",
    "may then be called into question .",
    "one can see that a linear taylor expansion @xmath35 yields for @xmath36 mev , noting that @xmath37 .",
    "the absence of a strong linear correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath18 calculated from different effective forces prompts one to think that @xmath32 and @xmath33 alone are not sufficient to yield the correct value of @xmath7 .",
    "further empirical information is possibly needed to arrive at that . in this paper",
    ", we show that with given values of only @xmath32 and @xmath33 along with some time - tested values of empirical nuclear constants , it is possible to address to a proper assessment of the value of incompressibility @xmath0 and its density dependence .",
    "the empirical constants are the saturation density @xmath3 , taken as 0.155 @xmath29 0.008 @xmath38 for snm and the energy per nucleon at that density @xmath4 , taken as @xmath390.1 mev @xcite .",
