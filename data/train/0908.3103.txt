    "for numerous high precision experiments , knowing the beam momentum in an accelerator with the greatest accuracy is essential .",
    "obvious examples of this are investigations of production reactions very close to the thresholds as well as particle mass determinations on the basis of reaction kinematics . here",
    "we present a technique that allows one to determine the momentum of a deuteron beam which is suitable for use in a precise measurement of the mass of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "measurements of the mass of the @xmath0 meson performed at different experimental facilities over the last decade have resulted in very precise results which differ by up to 0.5  mev/@xmath5 , i.e. , by more than eight standard deviations .",
    "the experiments that are no longer considered in the pdg tables  @xcite generally involve the identification of the @xmath0 as a missing - mass peak produced in a hadronic reaction . in order to see whether this is an intrinsic problem , and to clarify the situation more generally ,",
    "a refined measurement of the @xmath6 reaction was proposed  @xcite at the cooler synchrotron cosy of the forschungszentrum jlich  @xcite .    after producing the @xmath0 mesons through the @xmath6 reaction using a hydrogen cluster - jet target  @xcite , the @xmath7he",
    "would be detected with the anke magnetic spectrometer  @xcite that is located at an internal - target position of the storage ring .",
    "provided that the reaction is cleanly isolated , the @xmath0 mass can be extracted from pure kinematics through the determination of the production threshold .",
    "this requires one both to identify the threshold and to measure accurately the associated beam momentum .",
    "we have previously proved that anke has essentially 100% acceptance for the @xmath6 reaction for excess energies @xmath8 below about 10  mev  @xcite , though in that experiment the deuteron beam was continuously ramped from below the threshold up to @xmath9  mev . however , although the threshold was well identified , the corresponding value of the beam momentum was only known in the experiment with a relative accuracy of about @xmath10 .    for the new @xmath0 mass proposal  @xcite , the decision was taken to measure at thirteen fixed energies in the range @xmath11  mev as well as @xmath12  mev for background studies . to determine the mass using this kinematic method with a precision that is competitive with other recent measurements , i.e. , @xmath13  kev/@xmath5  @xcite",
    ", the associated beam momenta have to be fixed with an accuracy of @xmath14 .",
    "this requires the thirteen beam momenta in the range of @xmath15  mev/@xmath4 to be measured to better than 300  kev/@xmath4 .    generally at synchrotron facilities like cosy",
    ", the velocity of the beam particles , and hence the beam momentum , is determined from the knowledge of the revolution frequency combined with the absolute orbit length .",
    "the accuracy that can be reached using this technique is limited by the measurement of the orbit length by , e.g. , beam position monitors .",
    "this is in the region of @xmath16 and so an order of magnitude improvement is needed for the @xmath0 mass experiment .",
    "because of the technical limitations of such a macroscopic device , it is not feasible to obtain the necessary increase in accuracy by simply scaling up the number of beam pick - up electrodes .",
    "the beam momentum must therefore be determined in some other way .",
    "the method proposed for electron colliders more than thirty years ago to overcome this problem  @xcite has been very successfully applied at the vepp accelerator of the binp at novosibirsk to measure the masses of a wide variety of mesons from the @xmath17 to the @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "the technique was further developed at doris in hamburg  @xcite and cesr in cornell  @xcite as well as lep at cern  @xcite .",
    "the spin of a polarized beam particle precesses around the normal to the plane of the machine , which is generally horizontal .",
    "the spin can be perturbed by the application of a horizontal _ rf _ magnetic field from , for example , a solenoid .",
    "the beam depolarizes when the frequency of the externally applied field coincides with that of the spin precession in the ring .",
    "the usefulness of the technique relies on the fact that a frequency @xmath19 can be routinely measured with a relative precision of @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , the position of the depolarizing resonance depends purely upon the revolution frequency of the machine and the kinematical factor @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the particle total energy and mass , respectively .",
    "the measurements of the revolution and depolarizing frequencies together allow the evaluation of @xmath24 and hence @xmath22 and the beam momentum @xmath2 .",
    "there is no in - principle reason why the induced - depolarization approach should not be equally applicable to other beam particles with an intrinsic spin , such as protons or deuterons .",
    "in fact , the effects have recently been confirmed at cosy in studies of the spin manipulation of both polarized proton  @xcite and deuteron beams  @xcite .",
    "this is the methodology that we are pursuing at cosy for the measurement of the @xmath0 mass .",
    "for the first time in 2007 it was possible in a test run to reach an accuracy in the beam momentum calibration of @xmath25 using the technique with a coasting beam but no internal target  @xcite . in the present paper we describe how the method can be used in a standard beam time under normal experimental conditions in the presence of a thick internal target .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] we describe the physical principles underlying the spin - resonance method . after discussing the behavior of a vector polarized deuteron beam in cosy , we show how to induce an artificial spin resonance to depolarize the beam . the experimental conditions that allow one to determine the two critical observables",

    "the revolution frequency @xmath26 is measured via the schottky noise of the beam and the spin - resonance frequency @xmath27 using the _ rf _ solenoid and the edda detector as a beam polarimeter  @xcite .",

    "[ sec : results ] , where the estimated uncertainties are discussed in some detail .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : end ] .",
    "in contrast to the case of a spin - half fermion such as an electron or proton , the deuteron is a spin - one boson that can be placed in three magnetic sub - states @xmath28 , and the resulting polarization phenomenology is more complex .",
    "eight independent parameters are necessary to characterize a spin - one beam , three for the vector polarization and five for the tensor  @xcite .",
    "however , only the vector polarization @xmath29 is used in the present experiment for the spin - resonance method since it can be measured with the beam polarimeter to a higher precision than the tensor . here",
    "@xmath30 is the number of particles in state-@xmath23 and @xmath31 is the total number of particles .",
    "the motion of the spin vector @xmath32 , defined in the rest frame of the particle , in a circular accelerator , synchrotron or storage ring , is given by the thomas - bmt equation  @xcite :    @xmath33   \\ ; , \\ ] ]    where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the transverse and longitudinal components of the magnetic fields of the accelerator in the laboratory frame and @xmath36 represents the electric field .",
    "the velocity of the particle is @xmath37 , in terms of which @xmath38 .    in a synchrotron without horizontal magnetic fields and where the electric field is always parallel to the particle motion ,",
    "the spin motion only depends on the first term , i.e. , is a function of the transverse magnetic fields  @xmath34 of the accelerator .",
    "the deuteron spin precesses around the stable spin direction , which is given by the vertical fields of the guiding dipole magnets of the synchrotron .",
    "the number of spin precessions during a single circuit of the machine , the spin tune @xmath39 , is proportional to the particle energy . in the coordinate basis of the moving particle ,",
    "the spin tune is given by @xmath40 whereas , taking into account the extra rotation associated with a single circuit of the machine , this becomes @xmath41 in the laboratory frame . here",
    "@xmath42 is the gyromagnetic anomaly of the particle , where @xmath43 is the gyromagnetic factor . for deuterons",
    "the gyromagnetic anomaly , @xmath44 , can be calculated from the ratios of the magnetic moments and masses of the proton and deuteron  -factor of the deuteron is written in units of the nuclear magneton .",
    "if it is required in terms of the deuteron magneton , this has to be calculated from the @xmath43-factor of the proton and the ratios of the magnetic moment and mass of proton and deuteron : @xmath45 .",
    "the constants required can be found in the nist compilation   but in the evaluation of the uncertainty one has taken into account the fact that the values @xmath46 and @xmath47 are correlated .",
    "having done this , we find @xmath48 . ] .",
    "the beam polarization can be perturbed by a horizontal magnetic field in the synchrotron and , if the frequency of the perturbation coincides with the spin - precession frequency , the beam depolarizes .",
    "one kind of first - order resonance is the imperfection resonance .",
    "if the spin tune is an integer , then the horizontal imperfection fields of the synchrotron can interact resonantly with the particle spin , building up effects coherently turn by turn .",
    "the positions in momentum of the depolarizing resonances depend on the gyromagnetic anomaly of the particle .",
    "in contrast to the case of protons , where the first imperfection resonance occurs at a momentum of @xmath49  mev/@xmath4 , the first for deuterons is at @xmath50  gev/@xmath4 , which is well outside the cosy momentum range .",
    "furthermore , in the present experiment the spin tune remains in the region of @xmath51 .",
    "because of the betatron oscillation frequency of the circulating beam , the particles can also encounter the fields of the focusing quadrupole magnets in resonance with the spin tune , which lead to a second kind of first - order spin resonance , the so - called intrinsic resonance .",
    "these resonances also occur only for energies that are far beyond the cosy deuteron momentum and working point range  @xcite .",
    "a horizontal _ rf _ field from a solenoid can lead to _",
    "rf_-induced depolarizing resonances .",
    "depending on the form of the field , these can be used to depolarize the beam , to measure the spin tune , or even to flip the spin direction of the beam particles . the spin - resonance frequency for a planar accelerator where there are no horizontal fields",
    "is given by  @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the revolution frequency of the beam , @xmath54 is the spin tune , and @xmath55 is an integer . if the _ rf _ frequency of the perturbation is close to @xmath56 then the polarization of the beam is maximally influenced .",
    "horizontal magnetic fields in the accelerator lead to modifications of eqs .   and  @xcite .",
    "to avoid this complication , all solenoidal and toroidal magnets in the cosy ring , those of the experiment as well as those of the electron cooler , were switched off .",
    "residual shifts in the resonance frequency arising from field errors and vertical orbit distortions were estimated and found to be negligibly small .",
    "these effects are discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ subsec : ressysshift ] .",
    "it is important to note that eq .",
    "is only valid if , as is the case for the present experiment , there is no full or partial siberian snake . the resonance with @xmath57 was used as this matches the frequency range of the _ rf _ solenoid installed at cosy .",
    "the kinematic @xmath24-factor , and thus the beam momentum , can be determined purely by measuring both the revolution and spin - resonance frequencies .",
    "the cosy accelerator facility is presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : cosy ] .",
    "after pre - acceleration in the cyclotron julic , cosy can provide unpolarized and polarized proton and deuteron beams in the momentum range of @xmath58  mev/@xmath4 .",
    "for the present experiment , two of the four internal facilities were used , viz .",
    "anke with a thick hydrogen cluster - jet target and edda  @xcite as beam polarimeter  @xcite .",
    "the beam was accelerated with the _ rf _ cavity and the barrier bucket ( _ bb _ ) cavity was used to compensate for the energy losses incurred through the beam - target interactions ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : cavity ] ) .",
    "the position of the _ rf _ solenoid is also shown .",
    "the integrated value of the solenoid s maximum longitudinal _",

    "its frequency range is 0.51.5  mhz .",
    "( color online ) the cosy accelerator facility .",
    "the cyclotron julic provides both unpolarized and polarized proton and deuteron beams for injection into the cosy ring , where they are accelerated and stored .",
    "cosy operates in the momentum range of @xmath58  mev/@xmath4 .",
    "the position of the anke spectrometer with the thick internal hydrogen cluster - jet target is shown , as are those of the _ rf _ solenoid to depolarize the deuteron beam , the barrier bucket cavity to compensate beam - target energy losses , and the edda detector that was used as a beam polarimeter . ]      for a high precision experiment it is crucial that the beam momentum remains stable throughout the whole accelerator cycle .",
    "in a typical cycle of a standard scattering experiment at anke , the beam is first injected into cosy and accelerated to the nominal momentum .",
    "cavity is then switched off to provide a coasting beam that fills the ring uniformly .",
    "this then gives constant count rates , which reduces the dead time of the data acquisition system ( daq ) .",
    "but , because of the energy losses of the charged beam particles through electromagnetic processes as the beam passes repeatedly through the target , the momentum changes and this leads to a shift in the revolution frequency  @xcite .",
    "for a deuteron beam and a hydrogen cluster - jet target with a density of @xmath60 , the revolution frequency would change by up to @xmath61 over a 180  s long cycle , corresponding to a shift in beam momentum of 2.2  mev/@xmath4 .    to compensate for this effect and to guarantee a constant beam momentum over the whole data - taking cycle , a second cavity , the barrier bucket ( _ bb _ ) cavity  @xcite ,",
    "was switched on after the _ rf _ cavity was switched off . in this way a beam with a constant momentum over the whole cycle could be produced that filled roughly 80 ",
    "90% of the ring homogenously and thus achieved the necessary reduction in the dead time of the daq .",
    "the thirteen closely spaced energies studied near the @xmath0 threshold were divided into two so - called supercycles that involved up to eight different cosy machine settings .",
    "the first and the second supercycle each consisted of seven different energies where , to allow comparison between the two sets , the first energies of the two supercycles were chosen to be identical .",
    "data at thirteen different energies were therefore recorded .",
    "the different machine settings in the supercycles were imposed sequentially , after which the supercycle was repeated .",
    "each supercycle was used for five days of continuous schottky data taking to study the long term stability of cosy and to take data in parallel for the @xmath0 meson mass determination .",
    "the reason for choosing supercycles instead of independent measurements at fixed energies was to guarantee the same experimental conditions for each of the beam energies in one supercycle . in this way",
    "the systematic uncertainties could be investigated in more detail , as will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    ".[tab : timingsrm ] cycle timings used to determine the spin - resonance frequency spectrum with the polarized beam . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     two further quantities , the beam momentum smearing @xmath62 and the smearing of the orbit length @xmath63 , can be extracted from the spin - resonance spectra . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : ressysshift ] , the measured spin - resonance widths of 80 to 100  hz are dominated by the momentum spread . assuming a gaussian distribution in the revolution frequency with a @xmath64  hz , and neglecting other effects , the width of the spin - resonance distribution requires a momentum spread of @xmath65 .",
    "this upper limit on the beam momentum width corresponds to a smearing of the orbit length of @xmath66 .",
    "the momentum spread could be checked from the frequency slip factor @xmath0 , which was measured at each energy .",
    "using @xmath67 , this leads for example at @xmath68  gev/@xmath4 to ( @xmath69 , which is consistent with the limit obtained from the resonance distribution .",
    "in this paper we have shown how to determine the momentum of a deuteron beam in a circular accelerator with high precision using the spin - resonance technique developed at the vepp accelerator for electron beams .",
    "we have studied the depolarization of a polarized deuteron beam at cosy through an induced spin resonance for thirteen different beam energies .",
    "this was done under standard experimental conditions , i.e. , with cavities , in particular the _ bb _ cavity , and a thick internal cluster - jet target .",
    "the momenta and other beam properties were found by measuring the position of the spin - resonance and revolution frequencies .",
    "it was possible to determine the beam momenta with an accuracy of @xmath70 , i.e. , the thirteen momenta in the range @xmath71  mev/@xmath4 were measured with precisions of @xmath72  kev/@xmath4 , a feat never before achieved at cosy .",
    "the actual precision was limited by the systematic variations of the orbit length and the characteristics of the schottky spectrum analyzer .",
    "the latter could be improved significantly through the comparison with a calibrated frequency standard .",
    "the orbit length could be extracted from the revolution and spin - resonance frequencies with an accuracy of @xmath73 .",
    "thus for cosy , with a circumference of 183.4  m , the orbit length could be measured with a precision below 0.3  mm .",
    "this may allow one to gain a better knowledge of the orbit behavior in cosy .      in summary ,",
    "the spin - resonance method is a powerful beam diagnostic tool for circular accelerators , synchrotrons or storage rings without siberian snakes to investigate and determine beam properties . in our particular case",
    "it should eventually allow the mass of the @xmath0 meson to be measured with a precision of @xmath74  kev/@xmath5 .",
