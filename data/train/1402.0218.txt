    "the complexity of a large variety of systems , from infrastructures to the cell , is rooted in a network of interactions between their constituents @xcite .",
    "quantifying the robustness of complex networks is one of the main challenges of network of networks with implications in fields as different as biology or policy making and risk assessment .    in the last fifteen years",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the structure of a single network is strictly related to its robustness .",
    "but only recently @xcite , attention has been drawn toward a previously neglected aspects of complex systems , namely the interactions between several complex networks .",
    "rarely single networks are isolated , while it is usually the case that several networks are interacting and interdependent on each other .",
    "for example , in infrastructures , the banking systems are interdependent with the internet and the electric power - grid , public transport , such as subway , is dependent on the power - grid , which relies on its turn on the water supply system to cool the power - plants , etc . in the cell",
    "the situation is much similar : all cellular networks , such as the metabolic networks , the protein - protein interaction networks , the signaling networks , and the gene transcription networks are all dependent on each other , and the cell is only alive if all these networks are functional",
    ". these are examples of network of networks , i.e. , networks formed by several interdependent networks .    a special class of network of networks",
    "are multiplex networks @xcite , which are multilayer structures in which each layer is formed by the same set of nodes @xmath3 interconnected by different kinds of links for different layers . in other words , these are graphs with all nodes of one kind and with links of different colors .",
    "multiplex networks are attracting great interest as they represent a large variety of systems such as social networks where people can be linked by different types of relationships ( friendship , family tie , collaboration , citations , etc . ) or , for example , in transportation networks , where different places can be linked by different types of transportation ( train , flight connections , flight connection of different airline companies , etc . ) .",
    "multiplex network datasets @xcite are starting to be analysed , several modelling framework for these networks have been proposed @xcite and the characterization of a large variety of dynamical processes is getting a momentum @xcite . at this point",
    "we emphasize the principal difference between the interdependent and so - called interconnected networks .",
    "this difference is not about structural organization of connections between these networks but rather about the function of these interlinks .",
    "interlinks connecting different interdependent networks ( interdependencies ) show the pairs of nodes that can not exist without each other . in the present paper we consider variations of this kind of complex networks . on the other hand , in the interconnected networks @xcite , the interlinks play the same role as links in single networks , enabling one to consider , e.g. , various percolation problems , disease spreading , etc .",
    "a major progress in understanding the robustness of multilayer interdependent networks has been made in a series of seminal papers @xcite , where it has been proposed that a natural measure for evaluating the robustness of these structures to random failure is the size of a mutually connected giant component .",
    "the mutually connected giant component is the component that remains after breakdowns propagate back and forth between different interdependent networks ( layers ) generating a cascade of failure events .",
    "a node is in the mutually connected component of a multilayer network if all the nodes on which it depends are also in the mutually connected network and if at least one neighbor node in its own network ( layer ) belongs to the mutually connected component @xcite .",
    "clearly , the giant mutually connected component naturally generalizes the giant connected component ( percolation cluster ) in a single network .",
    "the robustness properties of multiplex networks have been right now well understood @xcite , including effects of degree correlations , the overlap of the links or antagonistic effects in this novel type of percolation problem @xcite . as the fraction of @xmath4 of removed nodes``igniters''increases ,",
    "multiplex networks are affected by cascading failures , until they reach a point for @xmath5 where the network abruptly collapses , and the size of the mutually connected component shows a discontinuous transition @xcite . in this case if a small fraction @xmath6 of nodes in the multiplex are not interdependent , then the transition can change from discontinuous to continuous @xcite . although the issue of interest in the present article is the giant mutually connected component , other special giant components can be introduced for these networks . here",
    "we mention only the so - called giant viable cluster @xcite between each two nodes of which , there is a complete set of interconnecting paths running through every layer .",
    "it is easy to see that the viable cluster is a subgraph of the mutual component .    .",
    "interdependencies ( interlinks between nodes from different levels ) are shown by the black dashed lines .",
    "intralinks between nodes within layers are shown as solid red lines . in each individual layer ( label @xmath7 ) , all nodes ( @xmath8 ) have the same number of interlinks ( superdegree @xmath9 ) .",
    "interlinks connect only nodes with the same label @xmath10 in different layers , forming @xmath3 `` local supernetworks '' @xmath11 .",
    "each of these local supernetworks is an uncorrelated random graph with a given superdegree sequence @xmath12 , @xmath13 , defined as the standard configuration model ( uniformly random interconnections for a given sequence of superdegrees ) . ]",
    "several works have considered afterwards a more general ( than multiplex ) case of a network of networks in which the layers are formed by the same number of nodes , where each node has a replica node in each other network and might depend only on its replica nodes . despite the major interest on the topic @xcite , only recently the following key circumstance become clear @xcite . when the interdependencies between the nodes are such that if a network depends on another network , all its nodes depend on the replica nodes of the other network , it turns out that the mutually connected component coincides with that in the corresponding fully connected network of networks , which is actually a particular case of a multiplex network .    here",
    "we show , nevertheless , that the situation changes if the interdependence links are distributed between layers more randomly , i.e. , if we remove the above constraint that all nodes in each layer are dependent on their replicas in the same set of other layers .",
    "we consider the situation in which a superdegree @xmath1 is assigned to each layer @xmath0 , so that each node of the network depends only on other @xmath1 replica nodes , but now these replica nodes are chosen randomly and independently from different layers , see fig .",
    "we call this construction the configuration model of a network of networks .",
    "the reason for this term is that for each set of nodes with given @xmath10 , consisting of nodes @xmath14 in all the layers @xmath13 , our definition provides the standard configuration model of a random network with a given sequence of superdegrees @xmath9 , @xmath13 , ( `` local supernetwork '' @xmath10 ) .",
    "let us compare this construction to the model of ref .  @xcite .",
    "while in ref .",
    "@xcite , all @xmath3 `` local supernetworks '' coincided , in the configuration model of network of networks defined in the present work , the `` local supernetworks '' differ from each other ; only their superdegrees @xmath9 coincide in the particular case of @xmath15 .",
    "depending on the superdegree sequence , `` local supernetworks '' can contain a set of finite connected components and a giant one .",
    "we consider specifically the case in which all the layers have the same internal degree distribution @xmath16 and where the superdegree distribution is @xmath17 .",
    "we derive equations for the order parameter of this problem . solving them numerically and analytically we show for this network of networks that if @xmath15 , the layers with increasing superdegree @xmath18 have a percolation transition at different values of @xmath19 , where @xmath19 is the fraction of not damaged nodes in the network , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1a ] . in other words , as @xmath19 increases , in layers with higher and higher @xmath18 , giant clusters of the mutual component emerge progressively , or , one can also say , the mutual component expands to layers with higher @xmath18 , see fig .",
    "all these transition are abrupt but also they are characterized by a singularity of the order parameter . finally we show that for @xmath20 , i.e. when interlinks between layers are removed with probability @xmath6 , each of these transitions involving the layers with @xmath21 can become continuous for @xmath22 . in the case of @xmath20",
    ", nodes in the same layer have different number of interlinks to other layers , which essentially generalizes the problem .",
    "a network of networks is formed by @xmath23 networks ( layers ) , @xmath24 , each formed by @xmath3 nodes , @xmath25 , where @xmath3 is infinite .",
    "in fact , in this work we also set @xmath26 , which enables us to use an analytical technique developed for the standard configuration model .",
    "these calculations exploit the locally tree - like structure of infinite uncorrelated networks .",
    "a more realistic case of a finite @xmath23 is a challenging problem .",
    "every node @xmath14 is connected with a number of nodes @xmath27 in the same layer and with a number of its `` replica nodes '' @xmath28 in other layers . for two layers ,",
    "this framework was proposed in ref .",
    "it was generalized to an arbitrary number of layers in refs .",
    "we consider the situation in which each layer @xmath0 is interdependent on @xmath1 other networks , so that each node @xmath10 in layer @xmath0 has exactly @xmath9 interlinks , which connect node @xmath10 only to its replica nodes in @xmath9 of other layers .",
    "we call @xmath1 the superdegree of the nodes of layer @xmath0 .",
    "we stress that the superdegree is associated with the nodes of a layer , and each node @xmath14 in a layer has the same superdegree @xmath9 .",
    "interlinks connecting replica nodes within different sets , say , interlink @xmath29 and interlink @xmath30 are assumed to be independent ( uncorrelated ) .",
    "for example , if a node @xmath14 of layer @xmath0 is interdependent on node @xmath28 of layer @xmath31 , then although another node @xmath27 of layer @xmath0 may in principle occur interdependent on node @xmath32 , in general , it depends on @xmath1 replica nodes @xmath33 sitting in any @xmath1 layers . following refs .",
    "@xcite , we define the network of networks with a super - adjacency matrix of elements @xmath34 if there is a link between node @xmath14 and node @xmath32 and zero otherwise . in these networks",
    "we have always @xmath35 if both @xmath36 and @xmath37 . for each node @xmath10 and all its replicas ,",
    "we introduce a `` local supernetwork '' , whose nodes are the layers and the links are interdependencies within this set of replicas . this network was discussed in refs .",
    "this local supernetwork is determined by the adjacency matrix @xmath38 parametrized by the node @xmath10 .",
    "this network may consist of a number of connected components .",
    "connected components from different local supernetworks are connected with each other through links within individual layers . in this work",
    "we explore this complicated system of interconnected components , which is necessary to describe the emergence of the giant mutually connected component and its expansion ( percolation ) over different layers .",
    "we define the mutually connected component as the following .",
    "each node @xmath14 is in the mutually connected component if it has at least one neighbor @xmath27 which belongs to the mutually connected component and if all the linked nodes @xmath28 in the interdependent networks are also in the mutually connected component . in these problems ,",
    "the giant ( i.e. , containing a finite fraction of nodes ) mutually connected component is single",
    ". it immediately follows from this definition that , remarkably , within each connected component of any local supernetwork , all its replica nodes either together belong to the mutually connected component or not . in our considerations",
    ", we will essentially exploit this strong consequence .",
    "given a network of networks it is easy to construct a message passing algorithm @xcite determining if node @xmath14 is in the mutually connected component .",
    "let us denote by @xmath39 the message within a layer , from node @xmath14 to node @xmath27 and indicating ( @xmath40 ) if node @xmath14 is in the mutually connected component when we remove the link @xmath41 in network @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , let us denote by @xmath42 the message between the `` replicas '' @xmath14 and @xmath28 of node @xmath10 in layers @xmath0 and @xmath31 .",
    "the message @xmath43 indicates if the node @xmath14 is in the mutually connected component when we remove the link between node @xmath14 and node @xmath28 .",
    "in addition to that we assume that the node @xmath14 can be damaged and permanently removed from the network .",

    "in this paper we have characterized the robustness properties of the configuration model of network of networks by evaluating the size of the mutually connected component when a fraction @xmath4 of nodes have been damaged and removed .",
    "the configuration model of network of networks is an ensemble of multilayer networks in which each layer is formed by a network of @xmath3 nodes , and where each node might depend only on its `` replica nodes '' on the other layers .",
    "we assign to each layer @xmath0 a superdegree @xmath1 indicating the number of interdependent nodes of each individual node @xmath14 of the layer @xmath0 and take these @xmath1 `` replica nodes '' in @xmath1 uniformly randomly chosen layers , independently for each node @xmath14 .",
    "we have shown that percolation in this ensemble of networks of networks demonstrate surprising features . specifically , for low values of @xmath19 , only the layers with low enough value of the superdegree are percolating , and as we raise the value of @xmath19 several discontinuous transition can occur in which layers of increasing value of superdegree @xmath18 begin percolate .    here",
    "we observe a sharp contrast to ordinary percolation in which nodes of high degree belong to the giant connected component ( percolation cluster ) with higher probability .",
    "this principal difference is explained by the definition of the mutual component according to which a node is in a mutual component only if all the nodes interdependent with this node belong to the mutual component .",
    "this condition makes more difficult the entrance into the mutual component for layers with a high superdegree .",
    "the non - trivial point here is that a layer of each given degree enters the mutual component not smoothly but through a discontinuous transition .",
    "the networks of networks which we considered in this paper differ from those we studied in our previous work  @xcite in one key aspect . in the present work ,",
    "interdependence links of different nodes of a layer are not lead to the same other layers as in ref .",
    "@xcite , but they are distributed over the other layers essentially more randomly , independently for different nodes of a layer . we have found that this additional randomness dramatically change results and leads to new effects . we obtained our results assuming that the number @xmath23 of layers in the network is infinite .",
    "a more realistic case of finite @xmath23 is a challenging problem .",
    "we would also like to stress that multiple discontinuous phase transitions in models for complex networks is a rear but not unique phenomenon .",
    "for example , multiple discontinuous transitions were recently reported in another network model @xcite .",
    "one should note that interlinking of only `` replica nodes '' is actually a great , very convenient simplification which has enabled us to solve the problem analytically .",
    "moreover , we have first assumed that all nodes in the same layer have equal superdegree ( number of interdependencies ) , which is a strong constraint . on the next step ,",
    "we however have removed this restriction by introducing the probability @xmath6 that an interdependence link is removed .",
    "we found that when a fraction @xmath164 of interdependent links are removed , each of these specific transitions can change from discontinuous to continuous .    in summary ,",
    "we have found novel percolation phenomena in a more general model of a network of networks than the network models which were considered previously .",
    "the multiple transitions , accompanying the expansion of mutual component over the layers of such a network of networks , are in dramatic contrast to ordinary percolation and to more simple interdependent and multiplex networks , e.g. , for a pair of interdependent networks . we suggest that our findings should be valid even for more general networks of networks .",
    "_ note added in proof _ we recently considered a network of networks in which interlinks between each two layers connect randomly selected nodes and not only `` replica nodes''.remarkably , it turned out that the results for this model are exactly the same as in the present article .",

    "in ref .  @xcite the percolation transition in a network of network in which all the local adjacency matrices are the same , i.e. , @xmath165 , was considered , implying that the local supernetwork is the same for every node @xmath10 . in this",
