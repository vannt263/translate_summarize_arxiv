    "that lowest member , denoted @xmath3 was known from the work of lorenz ( 1871 ) and hardy ( 1920 ) to be given by the product of the riemann zeta function @xmath2 , and the particular dirichlet @xmath0 or beta function , @xmath1 ( zucker and robertson , 1976 ) . in i",
    "it was also established that , if the complex variable @xmath4 is written as @xmath5 , and all zeros of @xmath3 lie on @xmath6 by a generalisation of the riemann hypothesis , then the whole class of sums has the same distribution function for zeros , as far as all terms tending to infinity with @xmath7 are concerned . in another paper (",
    "mcphedran & poulton , 2014 , hereafter referred to as ii ) it was established that an antisymmetric and a symmetric combination of two riemann zeta functions obeyed the riemann hypothesis , with the result for the antisymmetric combination being an alternative proof to one given by taylor ( 1945 ) .",
    "numerical evidence was given that the two combinations of zeta functions both have the same distribution functions of zeros on the critical line @xmath6 , and that this is also the same as that of @xmath3 and @xmath8 .    here",

    "we will also prove the corollary that , if the riemann hypothesis holds for @xmath11 in the range @xmath12 , then it also holds for @xmath1 at least in the range @xmath13 .",
    "the analytic function @xmath10 , defined by @xmath14 obeys the functional equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 [ thm5 - 1 ] it is monotonic decreasing along the real axis , apart from jumps at first - order poles . the poles are at @xmath17 , and are separated by first order zeros at @xmath18 .",
    "its phase on the critical line ( modulo @xmath19 ) is that of @xmath20 , which is for @xmath7 not small well approximated by @xmath21 , modulo @xmath19 .",
    "the functional equation for @xmath10 follows from that for @xmath3 ( see i ) and that for the riemann zeta function ( titchmarsh & heath - brown , 1987 ) : @xmath22    in @xmath23 , @xmath10 can be represented by its series obtained by direct summation , of which the first few terms are @xmath24 the pole at @xmath25 is that of the function @xmath11 in the numerator of @xmath10 , and the zero at @xmath26 is that of @xmath8 in the denominator .",
    "the positions of other poles and zeros on the real axis then follow from the functional equation ( [ del5 - 1 ] ) , together with the properties of the gamma functions in ( [ del5 - 2 ] ) .",
    "the residues of @xmath10 at its first few poles are ( 1 , 0.300645 ) , ( -3/4 , 0.312673 ) , ( -7/4 , 0.25505 ) , ( -11/4 , 0.237821 ) , ( -15/4 , 0.230136 ) and ( -19/4 , 0.22657 ) . the coefficients of the linear term round its first few zeros are ( 3/4 , -5.0378 ) , ( -1,-5.7055 ) , ( -2 , -4.9245 ) , ( -3 , -4.645 ) and ( -4 , -4.51975 ) .",

    "[ fig01]-[fig03 ] ) .",
    "we begin by taking the leading terms in equation ( [ del5 - 4 ] ) for @xmath48 : @xmath49 from ( [ del5 - 9 ] ) the leading terms in the expansions for the modulus and phase of @xmath10 are @xmath50\\simeq -\\frac{\\sin ( t\\ln 2)}{2^{\\sigma}},~~    \\label{del5 - 10}\\ ] ] thus , the lines of constant phase zero are those which can attain @xmath43 , and correspond to @xmath51 , for @xmath52 integral . in between these are lines of constant amplitude unity , which also can attain @xmath43 , and correspond to @xmath53 , for @xmath52 integral .    for large @xmath42 , the lines of phase zero mark the boundary between regions in which the phase of @xmath10 lies in the fourth quadrant ( on one side of the line ) and the first quadrant ( on the other side ) .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath10 in this region is given by @xmath54 , and thus decreases as @xmath42 decreases for @xmath52 odd , and increases for @xmath52 even .",
    "the amplitude is a monotonic function of @xmath42 , and must continue to behave monotonically even when @xmath42 is insufficiently large for ( [ del5 - 9 ] ) and ( [ del5 - 10 ] ) to be accurate . indeed ,",
    "if say the amplitude were decreasing , and then started to increase , the lines of constant amplitude forming around the central line of constant phase would have to form closed loops , not possible unless zeros and poles of @xmath10 lay within the loops .",
    "a similar argument of course applies to the case of increasing amplitude along the line of zero phase .",
    "lines of phase zero can not cut the critical line other than at a zero or pole of @xmath10 by virtue of its phase value ( [ del5 - 8 ] ) on the critical line .",
    "turning now to the lines of constant amplitude of unity , on one side the amplitude exceeds unity , and on the other it is less than unity .",
    "the phase of @xmath10 along these lines in the region of large @xmath42 is given by @xmath55 , and so lies in the fourth quadrant for @xmath52 even , and in the first for @xmath52 odd .",
    "it increases monotonically in its magnitude as @xmath42 decreases , and again this conclusion holds true even if @xmath42 is insufficiently large for ( [ del5 - 9 ] ) and ( [ del5 - 10 ] ) to be accurate .",
    "lines of constant unit amplitude must cut the critical line in between poles and zeros of @xmath10 .",
    "we next consider the properties of @xmath10 in @xmath56 .",
    "combining ( [ del5 - 6 ] ) and ( [ del5 - 9 ] ) the functional equation for @xmath10 gives @xmath57e^{-i\\pi/4 }   \\left ( 1-\\frac{\\sigma+i t}{16(\\sigma^2+t^2)}+\\ldots \\right ) , \\label{del5 - 11}\\ ] ] a good approximation in @xmath58 . comparing ( [ del5 - 11 ] ) and ( [ del5 - 9 ] ) , we see that the modulus is even under the transition from @xmath59 to @xmath60 . for the phase ,",
    "the imaginary @xmath7-dependent part has the opposite sign and there is a translation of @xmath61 , resulting in @xmath60 everywhere in @xmath34 and @xmath58 having a phase in the fourth quadrant .",
    "consider finally the possibility that the lines of constant amplitude and phase coming from @xmath43 ceased for some value of @xmath7 to reach the critical line .",
    "for this to occur , the lines of constant phase and amplitude would have to curve upwards and run towards @xmath62 , and they would have to do that everywhere above the starting value of @xmath7 .",
    "( otherwise , they would cut subsequent regions of lines of constant phase and amplitude heading towards the critical line , requiring the presence of accumulation points of zeros and poles in the finite part of the plane , not in keeping with the properties of @xmath3 and @xmath63 .",
    ") however , such lines coming from @xmath43 would require , from the functional equation corresponding lines to exist mirrored about @xmath6 .",
    "such lines on the right would have phases in the first and fourth quadrants , and on the left their phase values for @xmath64 would lie in the interval @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "the lines of constant amplitude are symmetric under @xmath66 if @xmath64 .",
    "this means sets of lines of constant amplitude are required to start in @xmath56 at high @xmath7 values and proceed as @xmath42 decreases towards smaller values of @xmath7 .",
    "however , from equation ( [ del5 - 11 ] ) , as @xmath42 increases , the algebraic terms in the parentheses dominate the values of @xmath67 , with the exponentially - decreasing terms having a much smaller effect .",
    "it is easy to show that the contours of constant amplitude @xmath68 of the term in parentheses in ( [ del5 - 11 ] ) are in fact circles given by : @xmath69 these circles lie in the required region @xmath42 significantly larger than one only for amplitudes @xmath68 close to but less than unity .",
    "this means that the contours of constant amplitude of @xmath60 which can proceed from @xmath70 towards strongly negative values are limited to amplitudes close to but less than unity .",
    "this gives a contradiction , since the lines of constant amplitude curving up towards the critical line correspond to amplitudes both larger and smaller than unity .",
    "in summary , lines of constant amplitude and phase curving up towards infinite @xmath7 near the critical line are ruled out by the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath60 for large @xmath42 .",
    "the only lines of constant phase of @xmath10 which can attain @xmath44 are equally spaced , and have interspersed lines of constant modulus .",
    "all such lines of constant phase reach the critical line at a pole or zero of @xmath10 .",
    "[ corol5 - 4 ]    the proof of this proposition is contained in the discussion of theorem [ thm5 - 2 ] , and specifically in the discussion of equation ( [ del5 - 11 ] ) , the functional equation ( [ del5 - 1 ] ) and equation ( [ del5 - 6 ] ) .",
    "the lines of constant phase referred to in fact correspond to the phase @xmath61 .",
    "there is no ambiguity ( modulo @xmath71 ) in this phase in @xmath72 , where the phase is controlled by the last two terms in ( [ del5 - 11 ] ) , and since the fourth quadrant region extends continuously from @xmath73 to @xmath74 , the phase of @xmath10 is similarly unique in @xmath75 .",
    "using theorem [ thm5 - 2 ] , we are in a position to follow the argument of i , to prove the equivalent of its theorem 4.3 .",

    "join these lines with two lines to the right of the critical line along which @xmath42 is constant .",
    "then the change of argument of @xmath10 around the closed contour @xmath79 so formed is zero , so by the argument principle the number of poles inside the contour equals the number of zeros .",
    "each non - trivial pole is formed by a zero of @xmath11 , so if there are no such zeros within @xmath79 there can be no zeros of @xmath3 and so of @xmath1 within @xmath79 .",
    "conversely , suppose there are no zeros of @xmath80 off the critical line .",
    "suppose the first zero of @xmath11 off the critical line occurs at @xmath81 .",
    "then there is a zero of @xmath82 off the critical line at @xmath83 , and so a pole of @xmath10 off the critical line there , with no possible zero off the critical line in that neighbourhood of @xmath7.this contradicts the argument principle .",
    "these arguments prove the theorem in the region to the right of the critical line lying between lines of zero phase of @xmath10 , with the result to the left of the critical line then guaranteed by the functional equation ( [ del5 - 1 ] ) .",
    "to complete the proof we need to show that any point in the region @xmath75 , @xmath78 is enclosed between lines of phase zero of @xmath10 coming from @xmath43 .",
    "we note that @xmath84 is one such line , and that for any @xmath75 the infinite number of such constant phase lines can not cluster into a finite interval of @xmath7 , since that would indicate an essential singularity of @xmath10 for that @xmath42 .",

    "[ corol5 - 1 ]    we know the first off - axis zero of @xmath11 has to occur for some @xmath87 .",
    "then @xmath10 has to have a pole off - axis at @xmath88 , and so it must have an off - axis zero between two enclosing contours of zero phase of @xmath10 coming from @xmath43 .",
    "this must correspond to a zero of @xmath1 , and there can be no previous off - axis zero between a lower pair of contours of zero phase .    combining theorem [ thm5 - 3 ] with theorem 4.3 of i",

    "assuming the riemann hypothesis holds for @xmath11 or @xmath1 , then given any two lines of phase zero of @xmath10 running from @xmath43 and intersecting the critical line , the number of zeros and poles of @xmath10 counted according to multiplicity and lying properly between the lines must be the same .",
    "[ thm5 - 4 ]    we follow the argument in theorem 4.5 of mcphedran et al ( 2013 ) .",
    "we consider a contour composed of two lines of phase zero , the segment between them on the critical line , and a segment between them on the interval @xmath48 .",

    "this phase change is made up of contributions from the changes of phase at the zero or pole @xmath93 , from the zero or pole @xmath94 , from the @xmath95 zeros and @xmath96 poles on the critical line between @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and from the phase change between the zeros and poles . in this list ,",
    "the first phase change is @xmath97 , the phase of @xmath98 on the critical line just below @xmath99 .",
    "the second change is @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the phase of @xmath10 just above @xmath102 . giving zero @xmath52 a multiplicity @xmath103 , and pole @xmath52 a multiplicity @xmath104 , the phase change at the former is @xmath105 and at the latter @xmath106 .",
    "the phase change between zeros and poles is @xmath107 .",
    "hence the phase change is @xmath108 leading to @xmath109 as asserted .    assuming the riemann hypothesis holds for @xmath11 or @xmath1 , if all zeros and poles on the critical line have multiplicity one , the numbers of zeros and poles on the critical line between any pair of lines of phase zero of @xmath10 coming from @xmath43 are the same .",
    "the distribution functions for zeros of @xmath3 and @xmath63 on the critical line must then agree in all terms which do not go to zero as @xmath110 .",
    "[ corol5 - 3 ]    the first assertion is a simple consequence of theorem [ thm5 - 4 ] .",
    "the second follows from theorems [ thm5 - 2 ] and [ thm5 - 4 ] : the number of zeros and poles between successive zero lines coming from @xmath43 match for all such pairs of lines .",
    "there are no zeros or poles on the critical line before the first line of phase zero off the real axis coming from @xmath43 , so the distribution functions of zeros of the numerator and denominator of @xmath10 must then agree exactly at the infinite set of values of @xmath7 corresponding to the intersection points above this first line , and in neighbourhoods including each member of the set .",
    "this precludes those distribution functions differing by terms which do not go to zero as @xmath110 .    from titchmarsh and heath - brown ( 1987 ) , given the riemann hypothesis holds for @xmath11 , the distribution function for its zeros on the critical line is @xmath111 where the functions @xmath112 and @xmath113 denote the sums of all terms which go to infinity as @xmath110 or which remain finite , respectively .",
