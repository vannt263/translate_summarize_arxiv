    "in her 2009 paper @xcite , a. henrich discussed three invariants of virtual knots , that were finite - type invariants ( ftis for short ) of order one .",
    "she proved that each of them was stronger than the previous one , and that the last invariant she defined ( the so - called `` glueing invariant '' ) was in fact the universal fti of order @xmath0 , in the sense that the value of any other fti @xmath1 of order @xmath0 on a virtual knot @xmath2 could be recovered from the glueing invariant , the first derivative of @xmath1 and the value of @xmath1 on a chosen representative of the homotopy class of @xmath2 . in order to do so she introduced singular virtual strings , extending the concept of virtual string ( or flat virtual knots ) , first studied by turaev in @xcite .",
    "this paper aims to extend the results of @xcite for framed virtual knots . to do so",
    ", we will need to give an appropriate definition of a framed virtual string ( i.e. flat framed virtual knot ) and check that the constructions in henrich s paper still hold in our case .",
    "we will see that all three of henrich s invariants generalize naturally , and that the glueing invariant is in fact the universal invariant for framed virtual knots ( in the same sense as in henrich s paper ) .    to prove this result",
    "we will need to refer to the theory of based matrices , developed in @xcite and @xcite , and extend that theory to the case of framed virtual strings .",
    "this extension is non - trivial , and working in the framed category can yield an indeterminacy in the based matrices due to the possible application of a whitney belt trick .",
    "this indeterminacy was absent from the unframed case , and it is also present when looking at singular based matrices .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : section [ section2 ] recalls the definitions of virtual knots , flat virtual knots and finite - type invariants ; section [ section3 ] recalls the invariants from @xcite and generalizes them to the framed case ; section [ section4 ] recalls and extends the construction of based matrices ; in particular , section [ section5 ] proves that the glueing invariant is strictly stronger than the smoothing invariant even in the framed case .",
    "i am thankful to my advisor , vladimir chernov , for many useful discussions .",
    "virtual knots were introduced by kauffman in @xcite",
    ". we can think about them in three different ways : we can interpret them as knots in thickened surfaces up to the addition / removal of handles ; as classes of gauss diagrams ; or as knot projections with three types of crossings ( classical positive , classical negative and virtual ) up to reidemeister moves ( both classical and virtual ) .",
    "this paper will focus on framed virtual knots , i.e. knots with a non - vanishing normal vector field ; diagrammatically this category uses all the reidemeister moves ( classical and virtual ) except for classical reidemeister one , which gets replaced by the move shown in figure [ framedr1 ] .",
    "note in particular that virtual reidemeister one is still allowed .",
    "we will sometimes call the usual virtual knot theory `` unframed '' ( in contrast with the `` framed '' version ) .",
    "if instead of looking at isotopy classes we look at homotopy classes of virtual knots we get the theory of flat virtual knots ( or virtual strings , in turaev s terminology ) .",
    "diagrammatically this is equivalent to forgetting whether a classical crossing is positive or negative , as we can deform one into the other ; or to adding the cc ( crossing change ) move , that lets us change a positive crossing into a negative one and vice versa , see figure [ ccmove ]        one big difference between classical and virtual knot theory is the number of homotopy classes : there is only one homotopy class of classical knots , corresponding to the unknot , as we can always transform any knot into the unknot by switching some crossings .",
    "this is no longer true for virtual knots , and there are infinitely many homotopy classes of virtual knots , so we get a non - tivial theory .",
    "diagrammatically we represent flat virtual knots as knot diagrams with two types of crossings ( classical and virtual ) with an appropriate set of reidemeister moves , which we get from the moves of virtual knot theory by forgetting the over / under crossing information .",
    "the only moves that change are the ones in figure [ flatreidemeistermoves ] .",
    "clearly we can define virtual links and flat virtual links in a similar way .",
    "there is however an important distinction that needs to be made : flat virtual links do not correspond anymore to homotopy classes of virtual links .",
    "this is because homotopy does not allow the cc move if the two strands belong to different components , so the notion of flat virtual link is slightly weaker than the notion of homotopy of virtual links .    to generalize the three invariants from @xcite to framed virtual knots we need to introduce the notion of a flat framed virtual knot .",
    "the notion is very natural : they correspond to framed virtual knots modulo the cc move , and to homotopy classes of framed virtual knots .",
    "diagrammatically they correspond to flat virtual knots , where the first classical reidemeister move has been replaced by the flat version of figure [ framedr1 ] , shown in figure [ flatframedr1 ] .",
    "[ flatframedr1 ]       in the classical case , a finite - type invariant ( or vassiliev invariant ) is the extension of a knot invariant @xmath3 to the class of knots with transverse double points , given by the following expression :    @xmath4 this expression is also sometimes referred to as a `` formal derivative '' of the invariant @xmath3 .",
    "we say the invariant is of finite type and has order @xmath5 if it vanishes identically on all knots with more than @xmath6 double points ( i.e. if its @xmath7st derivative vanishes ) .",
    "the order of the invariant determines a filtration on the space of ftis , so that we can define the space of invariants of order @xmath8 as the quotient of the invariants of order @xmath5 by those of order @xmath9 many famous knot invariants are ( or can be reduced to ) finite - type invariants , for example the jones and homfly - pt polynomials ( after a power series expansion ) .",
    "finite - type invariants for classical knots have been classified through the work of vassiliev and kontsevich , who showed that the space of vassiliev invariants of order @xmath8 is isomorphic to the dual space of the chord algebra on @xmath6 chords ( denoted by @xmath10 ) , modulo the following two relations :        . ]    as usual in such pictures we assume that the diagrams coincide outside of the parts we drew .",
    "we call figure [ onet ] the one - term relation and figure [ 4 t ] the four - term relation ( @xmath11 ) for chord diagrams .    for kauffman ( @xcite ) ,",
    "a finite type invariant of virtual knots is the extension of a virtual knot invariant to the category of singular virtual knots .",
    "these are virtual knots with an extra type of crossing ( transverse double points ) , modulo the reidemeister moves for virtual knots and some extra moves , which he calls rigid vertex isotopy and that are represented in figure [ rigidvertexisotopy ] .",
    "the extension uses the same exact formula as in the classical case :    @xmath4 we then say that @xmath3 is a finite type invariant of order @xmath5 if it vanishes on every knot with more than @xmath6 double points ( i.e. the @xmath7st derivative vanishes )",
    ". examples of finite - type invariants according to this definition are the coefficient of @xmath12 in the conway polynomial or the birman coefficients .",
    "a vassiliev invariant is said to be universal if any other invariant of the same order with values in some abelian group can be recovered from the universal invariant by some natural construction .",
    "for example , a vassiliev invariant of order one is the universal invariant of order one if we can recover the value of any other vassilev invariant @xmath1 of order @xmath0 on any knot @xmath2 using our universal invariant , the first derivative of @xmath1 and the value of @xmath1 on a representative for each of the homotopy classes of virtual knots with a double point .",
    "the universal invariant @xmath13 from @xcite that we will later generalize gives the formula    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is in the homotopy class of @xmath2 , @xmath13 is our universal invariant and @xmath16 is the first derivative of @xmath1 ( where we re using the fact that @xmath16 is constant on homotopy classes of singular virtual knots with one double point ) .",
    "pick a classical crossing @xmath17 of the knot @xmath2 and smooth it according to orientation .",
    "the result will be a two component virtual link ; consider the flat virtual link associated to it .",
    "choose an arbitrary ordering @xmath18 of the components , and give a sign to every crossing in @xmath19 according to the following rule :        [ def1 ] the _ intersection index _ of the crossing @xmath17 is given by    @xmath20    let @xmath21 be an ordered two - component flat framed virtual link , with @xmath19 the set of intersections of the two components .",
    "then @xmath22 is invariant under framed flat equivalence .",
    "it s an easy exercise to check that the intersection index is invariant under reidemeister moves ; in particular , flat framed reidemeister move one only adds self - crossings , which do nt influence the value of @xmath23 . moreover , changing the order of the components simply changes the sign of the intersection index .",
    "given a virtual knot @xmath2 , its polynomial invariant @xmath24 $ ] is given by the formula    @xmath25    where @xmath17 is taken over all classical crossings of @xmath2 .",
    "the polynomial @xmath26 is an invariant of framed virtual knots .",
    "the proof is basically the same as in the non - framed case .",
    "we only need to check that @xmath27 is invariant under the framed version of reidemeister one .",
    "applying framed reidemeister one introduces two new crossings of opposite sign .",
    "call those crossings `` @xmath28 '' and `` @xmath29 '' respectively ; then we introduce two new terms in @xmath27 , of the form    @xmath30    however , it s easy to see that , after smoothing either of the crossings , the two components of the flat virtual link we get do not intersect .        thus @xmath31 and the terms in equation [ eq1 ]",
    "cancel each other , showing that @xmath27 is indeed invariant under framed reidemeister one .",
    "the proof that @xmath27 is a vassiliev invariant of order one is unchanged from @xcite .",
    "let @xmath32 be the polynomial invariant ( for framed virtual knots ) with coefficients in @xmath33 instead of @xmath34 .",
    "then @xmath32 is a homotopy invariant of framed virtual knots .",
    "@xmath27 is already invariant under classical and virtual reidemeister moves ( including framed reidemeister one ) , so @xmath32 also is .",
    "moreover , applying the cc move changes the coefficient of the term associated to that crossing from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "thus @xmath32 is invariant under the cc move as well .",
    "we wo nt mention @xmath32 again , but it is used in the proof that the smoothing invariant is strictly stronger than the polynomial invariant , so we needed to check that it was still an invariant in the framed case .",
    "let @xmath2 be a virtual knot diagram .",
    "let @xmath37 be the unordered two - component virtual link obtained by smoothing @xmath2 at a classical crossing @xmath17 , and @xmath38 $ ] its flat equivalence class .",
    "then the smoothing invariant , which takes values in @xmath39 $ ] ( the free abelian group generated by homotopy classes of framed virtual links with two components ) , is given by the formula    @xmath40\\ ] ]    where once again the sum is over all classical crossings of @xmath2 .",
    "the smoothing invariant is an invariant of framed virtual knots .",
    "moreover , it s a vassiliev invariant of order one .",
    "the proof is similar to the one for the polynomial invariant . to see it s an invariant of framed virtual knots it s enough to check invariance under framed reidemeister one , as invariance under reidemeister two and three follows from the unframed case .",
    "as before , smoothing the two crossings `` @xmath28 '' and `` @xmath29 ''",
    "that we get from framed reidemeister one gives us the two pictures in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "then the two crossings we introduced change @xmath41 by the following amount :    @xmath42-[k^{-}_{sm } ] \\label{eq2}\\ ] ]    but the flat knots @xmath43 $ ] and @xmath44 $ ] are clearly homotopic , so equation [ eq2 ] vanishes .",
    "this shows that @xmath45 is a framed virtual knot invariant .",
    "the proof that it s a vassiliev invariant of order one is the same as in the unframed case ( again , see @xcite ) .",
    "the smoothing invariant is strictly stronger than the polynomial invariant    the statement means that if two knots have the same @xmath45 value they have the same @xmath27 value , and that there are two knots @xmath46 such that @xmath47 but @xmath48 .",
    "the proof is again the same as the unframed case , using the same pair of virtual knots , pictured in figure [ smoothingandpoly ] ; the only thing we need to check is that `` @xmath49 '' invariant defined in the proof is also an invariant in the framed category .",
    "but since @xmath49 is defined as a sum over crossings that involve both components of the link , it is clearly invariant under framed reidemeister one ( which only adds / removes self - crossings ) .",
    "the final invariant takes values in the set free abelian group generated by flat framed virtual knots with one double point ..",
    "let @xmath2 be a virtual knot diagram .",
    "let @xmath50 $ ] be the flat equivalence class of the singular knot obtained by glueing the crossing @xmath17 of @xmath2 into a double point .",
    "then @xmath51 is given by the following formula ( where , as above , the sum ranges over all classical crossings of @xmath2 ) :    @xmath52.\\ ] ]    the glueing invariant is the universal order one invariant of framed virtual knots .",
    "the proof that it s an invariant or that it s a vassiliev invariant of order one is similar to the previous ones .",
    "in particular , invariance under framed reidemeister one comes from the fact that the two crossings we introduce have opposite sign , and the corresponding two terms in @xmath51 are homotopic , since we can move a little kink with a double point around the knot using reidemeister moves and the rigid vertex isotopy moves .",
    "the proof that it s the universal order one vassiliev invariant is the same as the unframed case , see @xcite    [ thm1 ] the glueing invariant is strictly stronger than the smoothing invariant .",
    "universality of @xmath53 gives us that it s stronger than @xmath45 . to show it s strictly stronger than @xmath45 we need to exhibit a pair of framed virtual knots such that @xmath54 but @xmath55 .",
    "to do so we will need to extend the theory of based matrices for virtual strings and singular virtual strings to the framed case .",
    "for readers that do nt want to get bogged down in the details , here s the overall picture of this section and how it is used to prove theorem [ thm1 ] .",
    "we can associate to every flat virtual knot ( framed or unframed ) a skew - symmetric @xmath56 matrix , where @xmath57 is the number of crossings of the knot .",
    "the first row of the matrix corresponds to a special element , called `` core element '' , and is left unchanged throught . since we want the matrices to represent flat virtual knots , and not just their diagrams , we need to impose invariance under flat reidemeister moves . at the matrix level",
    "this translates in a set of so - called `` elementary operations '' ( see [ elemmovesframed ] for the framed case ) that add / remove / change rows from the matrix . when matrices are related by such elementary operations , we call them _",
    "homologous_. because of",
    "how we constructed homology classes , if two flat virtual knots are homotopic their based matrices will be homologous .",
    "the next step is to generalize this based matrix construction to the case of flat virtual knots with one double point .",
    "we construct in the same way , pretending the double point is just a normal flat crossing , and place the row / column corresponding to the double point as the last row / column of the matrix .",
    "we also add another elementary operation , that will guarantee invariance under the rigid vertex isotopy moves of figure [ rigidvertexisotopy ] .",
    "we then have once again that if the flat virtual knots with one double point are ( rigid vertex ) homotopic , their based matrices will be homologous .",
    "because the glueing invariant is given in terms of homotopy classes of knots with one double point , we can use based matrices to distinguish such classes . indeed ,",
    "if two based matrices are not homologous , the homotopy classes of the knots they represent can not be homotopic .",
    "theorem [ thm1 ] will be proven by looking at the terms of @xmath58 and showing that some terms do nt cancel , since their based matrices are not homologous .",
    "the details of the proof are in section [ section5 ]        for an integer @xmath59 , a virtual string @xmath60 of rank @xmath61 is an oriented circle @xmath45 , called the core circle of @xmath60 , and a distinguished set of @xmath62 distinct points on the circle partitioned in ordered pairs .",
    "we call these pairs the arrows of @xmath60 ; the collection of all arrows is denoted @xmath63 .",
    "the endpoints of an arrow @xmath64 are called respectively the tail ( @xmath65 ) and the head ( @xmath66 ) of the arrow .",
    "finally , two virtual strings are homeomorphic if there is an orientation - preserving homeomorphism of the core circles sending the arrows of the first string to the arrows of the second .",
    "we only consider virtual strings up to homeomorphism .",
    "drawing the flat virtual knot associated to the virtual string is the same as drawing the knot associated to a gauss diagram . an easy way of portraying the flat virtual knot is to assume the virtual strings is a gauss diagram whose arrows are all positive , draw the corresponding virtual knot and `` flatten '' all the crossings .",
    "more rigorously , every arrow on our string corresponds to a double point in the following way :              homeomorphism is however still too fine a classification , as it corresponds to ambient isotopy of knot diagrams ; in particular , knots that differ by a reidemeister move have different underlying virtual strings . we aim to fix that by introducing the concept of homotopy of virtual strings , basically translating reidemeister moves for flat virtual knots into the virtual string language . to picture them we can simply apply the procedure of figure [ figure2 ] to the gauss diagram version of reidemeister moves .",
    "the key in @xcite is that turaev associates to every homotopy class of virtual strings a `` homology '' class of a based matrix , and proves that if two virtual strings are homotopic the respective based matrices are homologous , so that based matrices are a tool we can use to distinguish homotopy classes of virtual strings .",
    "clearly the term `` based matrix '' comes from the matrix representation of @xmath66 .",
    "we always choose the core element @xmath76 to be the first element in the basis of the matrix representation ; the first row will then show the values @xmath77 .",
    "we can use the three element types to define elementary extensions of a based matrix :    * @xmath78 changes @xmath79 into @xmath80 such that @xmath81 extends @xmath66 and @xmath82 is annihilating ; * @xmath83 changes @xmath79 into @xmath84 such that @xmath85 extends @xmath66 and @xmath82 is a core element ; * @xmath86 changes @xmath79 into @xmath87 such that @xmath88 is any skew - symmetric map extending @xmath66 in which @xmath89 are complementary .",

    "two based matrices are homologous if they can be obtained from each other by a finite number of elementary extensions and their inverses .",
    "this lemma is useful because it lets us extend an isomorphism invariant of based matrices to a homology invariant .",
    "we do so by taking a primitive based matrix in the homology class and evaluating the invariant on it ; any other primitive based matrix in the same homology class is isomorphic to it , so the invariant is well - defined .",

    "since the two possibilities are independent from each other , a homology class of sbms can have one , two or four primitive elements in it .",

    "then , in a similar fashion to the proof of lemma [ lemma1 ] , we claim the following      assuming the claim holds , primitivity of @xmath238 means that there can be no @xmath245 at either end of the sequence .",
    "it is then enough to show that a sequence of @xmath246 moves can be reduced to having at most one @xmath134 and one of @xmath247 .",
    "we already know from lemma [ lemma1 ] that even powers @xmath157 can be removed , as we can express them in terms of @xmath145s and use primitivity .",
    "clearly @xmath157 commutes with @xmath230 , as one is applied to the distinguished element and the other is applied to something that is nt the distinguished element . @xmath157",
    "either commutes with @xmath124 ( if they act on distinct elements ) or the composition ( in either order ) is equivalent to one of the @xmath230 .",

    "finally , @xmath249 and @xmath256 is either acting on two distinct elements ( in which case the actions commute , and we might be able to use @xmath144 to reduce the cardinality of @xmath53 ) or it can only happen if the core element @xmath76 is annihilating - like , in which case the action of @xmath134 is trivial .",
    "overall the only things that can survive are at most a single instance of @xmath124 and up to two instances of @xmath257 , one acting on @xmath17 and the other not acting on @xmath17 .",
    "but if @xmath257 can act on @xmath17 then @xmath17 must be core - like or annihilating - like , in which case @xmath124 is in fact acting as @xmath134 as well ( since for @xmath124 @xmath123 ) .",
    "the proof roughly goes the same way as in @xcite .",
    "we need to show that can stack terms of the form @xmath258 to the middle of the sequence , eventually with some @xmath124 terms .",
    "we start by noticing that @xmath230 commutes with @xmath155 , @xmath259 .",
    "this is somewhat obvious , as the net result of @xmath230 is to only act on the distinguished element .",
    "moreover , the proof of lemma [ lemma1 ] already shows that we can push the @xmath144 terms to the right and stack the @xmath134 terms in the middle .",
    "thus we only need to check that any move of the form @xmath260 that is nt equivalent to @xmath230 or an isomorphism can be rewritten in the desired form , i.e. as a sequence of equal or shorter length in which inverses extensions happen before extensions .",
    "this is enough to bring the sequence in the desired form .",
    "* @xmath261 : @xmath124 exchanges the role of @xmath17 with a complementary element @xmath186 , @xmath129 introduces @xmath180 and @xmath196 removes @xmath206 , all annihilating elements . if @xmath262 or @xmath263 we can commute @xmath124 with the respective extension , at which point we have @xmath264 on either side of @xmath124 and we can apply lemma [ lemma1 ] to get the desired form .",
    "now suppose that the action of @xmath124 intertwines the actions of @xmath265 , say @xmath266 and @xmath267 , so we add two annihilating elements , swap one of them with @xmath17 and remove what was @xmath17 with another annihilating element .",

    "@xmath194 : this case is unchanged from @xcite .",
    "we can now look at the framed singular virtual string associated to a framed flat virtual knot with exactly one double point .",
    "the construction is exactly the same as the unframed case : the arrow corresponding to the double point is the preferred element , we do not allow framed reidemeister one moves that involve the double point , and we add the extra move ( s - ii ) as in @xcite ( it will correspond to the singularity switch ) . we get the sbm associated to the framed virtual string again using the intersection index and the formula @xmath108 .",
    "we pick the matrix representation of @xmath66 in which @xmath76 is the first row and @xmath17 is the last row .",
    "we need to see how the reidemeister moves and ( s - ii ) act on the virtual string .",
    "but since the analogous theorem holds in the non - singular case , and reidemeister moves do not involve the singular crossings , they satisfy the required condition .",
    "moreover , the move ( s - ii ) acts precisely as the singularity switch @xmath124 .",
    "thus the result holds .",
    "as we already mentioned , the glueing invariant is clearly stronger than the smoothing invariant , since the glueing invariant is the universal vassiliev invariant of order one . to show it s",
    "strictly stronger we need to exhibit two virtual knots @xmath277 such that @xmath54 but @xmath55 .",
    "these are modified versions of the ones used in @xcite .",
    "the reason why that pair does nt work anymore is that it relied on reidemeister move one to cancel out terms and show that @xmath278 . with the framed version of reidemeister one that cancellation does nt happen anymore , as every term has an extra kink in one of the components .",
    "we can solve this issue by adding a kink to both knots in a specific spot , as shown in figure [ k1andk2 ]          @xmath279 and @xmath280 only differ at the crossings @xmath281 and @xmath282 , so if we show that those two crossings contribute a same amount to @xmath283 the claim will be proven .",
    "moreover , the two knots have the same writhe , so we only need to check that @xmath284+[(k_1)^4_{sm}]=[(k_2)^3_{sm}]-[(k_2)^4_{sm}]\\ ] ] ( according to our notation in section [ section1 ] ) .",
    "but it s easy to see that @xmath285=[(k_i)^4_{sm}]$ ] , as for crossing number @xmath281 we can first undo a virtual crossing and then use reidemeister move two to remove two flat crossings , while for crossing @xmath282 we can ( using flatness ) move a kink around , then undo a virtual crossing and finally use reidemeister move two to remove two flat crossings .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "let us now construct the sbm associated with @xmath279 where we glued crossing @xmath281 .",
    "again , it is similar to the one in @xcite , except there is a small isolated arrow at the bottom of the picture , see figure [ figure4 ]          note that this is just the matrix of @xcite with an extra annihilating element added to it , which is what we expected ( since we simply added a kink to the original knot ) .",
    "similarly , the matrix of @xmath279 where crossing @xmath282 got glued is the following      both matrices are primitive : neither @xmath129 nor @xmath131 can be applied , and no two rows add up to @xmath76 , so @xmath133 and @xmath124 can not be applied either .",
    "we could at best apply @xmath134 to crossing @xmath282 , but we would still be unable to apply @xmath131 because it can not involve the @xmath76 row .",
    "@xmath17 is clearly neither annihilating - like nor core - like in either matrix , and neither isomorphisms nor the @xmath124 move can relate the two sbms .",
    "note that even if the two matrices only differ by the exchanged roles of the third and last row , we can not use the @xmath124 move to exchange them because they do nt add up to the values of the @xmath76 row .",
    "since the sbms are not homologous , the flat knots are not homotopic .",
    "so the terms in @xmath289 corresponding to crossings @xmath281 and @xmath282 do not cancel like they did in @xmath290 .",
    "the corresponding terms in @xmath291 have opposite signs , so in @xmath58 those terms add up , @xmath292 $ ] with coefficient @xmath293 and @xmath294 $ ] with coefficient @xmath295 .",
    "since these terms do not cancel , @xmath296 , hence @xmath55 .",
