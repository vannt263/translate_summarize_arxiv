    "the tensors in equations and indicate a stress that is primarily biaxial in the @xmath12 plane , with principal axes closely aligned to the @xmath58 $ ] and @xmath59 $ ] crystal axes .",
    "that there is very little tensile or compressive stress along the [ 001 ] axis is not surprising as this is the growth axis of the crystal and the nv defects measured here are @xmath60 m below the surface .",
    "the apparent absence of any nvs oriented parallel to @xmath50 $ ] may be a result of both the stressed lattice and the nv defects having been generated during the cvd grown process , whereupon there are likely to be preferred and inhibited directions for defect orientation @xcite .",
    "we now discuss issues related to the sensitivity of the technique . for simplicity",
    "we have presented only the theory applicable to a stress perturbation larger than 10 mpa , equivalent to the @xmath6110 ghz splitting of the unperturbed @xmath19 level , and have treated the spin levels as degenerate .",
    "smaller stresses can equally be determined by measuring in more detail the spectrum of the @xmath19 state and using the full theoretical description that includes the spin - orbit and spin - spin interactions @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity is also clearly limited by the spectral resolution of the measurements , which is ultimately determined by the transition line widths .",
    "these are a strong function of temperature , so that the sensitivity increases as the sample is cooled .",
    "line widths approaching 10 mhz have been observed using photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy at 2.8 k @xcite , corresponding to stress magnitudes of order kpa , or strains of order 10@xmath1 .",
    "although at such extreme sensitivity local variations in the built - in lattice stress would certainly dominate , _",
    "changes _ in strain of this magnitude may ultimately be detectable . at higher temperatures",
    "the line widths broaden rapidly due to the dynamic jahn teller effect @xcite , and at 77 k they are limited to about 10 ghz corresponding to stresses of order 10 mpa . at 300 k the zero phonon line is generally not clearly visible , and so stress mapping under ambient conditions would require utilisation of the stress perturbation to the electron spin state of the centre , measured using optically detected magnetic resonance ( odmr ) . the spin - orbit interaction introduces a stress component to the spin splittings in both the orbital doublet excited state @xcite and , through inter level mixing , the orbital singlet ground state @xcite . although the stress dependence of the spin transitions is much stronger in the excited state , the odmr line width is limited by the optical relaxation time ( @xmath6212 ns ) thereby limiting the sensitivity of excited state techniques .",
    "ground state odmr probing the spin transition at 2.88 ghz is therefore likely to be the more sensitive method . in this way ,",
    "dolde et al have demonstrated the use of single nv centres as electric field sensors with a dc sensitivity of 891 @xmath63 v @xmath64 hz@xmath65 , equivalent to a stress of about 90 kpa hz@xmath65 . by combining data from three differently oriented nv centes the full stress tensor",
    "can similarly be extracted ( see supplementary info for details ) .",
    "volumetric imaging of the stress tensor is possible by recording a 3-d distribution of defects . with a standard scanning confocal optical microscope",
    "this can provide sub - micrometre spatial resolution per defect , therefore up to @xmath66 @xmath67 m resolution for the full tensor .",
    "however nv centres in diamond are also ideally suited to super - resolution optical techniques such as stimulated emission depletion microscopy @xcite that utilise an intense depopulating beam and require highly robust photon emitters .",
    "such techniques are entirely compatible with the methodology described here and could yield spatial resolution on a length scale of a few nanometres for systematic investigations of local stress fields .",
    "we note that such spatial resolution would be fundamentally incompatible with the various existing approaches to stress / strain measurement .",
    "ebsd , raman , and band gap luminescence all interrogate quantities that depend on the periodicity of the crystal lattice and can therefore only measure strain averaged over a volume , or length , that is large compared with the lattice spacing .",
    "the use of point defects as sensors therefore opens up new possibilities for stress / strain measurement such as measuring lattice scale fluctuations in stress caused by nearby defects or surfaces , or for use in nanoscale sensors , for example in nano - electromechanical systems ( nems ) .",
    "the sample studied was a high purity , [ 001 ] oriented type iia diamond grown by microwave plasma - assisted chemical vapour deposition ( cvd ) @xcite .",
    "homoepitaxial cvd diamond growth was performed using a selected high pressure high temperature grown substrate , which had been carefully processed prior to growth in order to minimize the dislocation density in the grown cvd diamond . the resultant diamond had a nitrogen concentration of @xmath68 5 ppb as measured by ensemble electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) and a boron concentration of @xmath68 0.5 ppb as measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry ( sims ) .",
    "after growth the sample was mechanically polished to have a surface rms roughness @xmath68 1 nm over a 1 @xmath69 1 @xmath67 m area .",
    "low temperature photoluminescence microscopy and spectroscopy was recorded using a custom - made fiber - coupled scanning confocal microscope @xcite .",
    "photon counting for image generation utilised a perkin elmer spcm .",
    "spectra were recorded using an acton sp 500 monochromator and princeton spec 10:100b ccd camera .",
    "polarization dependence of emission was measured by placing a linear optical polarizer in front of the collection aperture of the microscope .",
    "a slight wedge in the plate leads to partial misalignment of the microscope as the polarizer is rotated , resulting in asymmetry in some of the data in figure [ polarplots ] .",
    "the expressions for @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 depend on the orientation of the nv centre .",
    "since the nv axis can take one of the four @xmath70 directions ( the order of the nitrogen and vacancy sites is not important ) we require four sets of equations . to calculate these we start with the equations for the @xmath16 $ ] oriented defect with the stress tensor components referred to the crystal axes @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath52 ( see equation ) and apply successive rotations of @xmath73 around the @xmath15 axis to the coefficients matrix @xmath74 .",
    "since the stress component @xmath40 transforms under symmetry operations as the product @xmath75 , the result of these rotations can be seen by the successive mappings @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the full set of equations is presented below .",
    "the use of a @xmath82 $ ] oriented sample in this study derives from the standard growth conditions of high purity cvd diamond and the ready availability of a suitable sample for study .",
    "however as mentioned earlier this viewing axis results in an unavoidable ambiguity in the orientation of any given nv centre , effectively a mirror in @xmath52 , so that for a given nv centre we can not distinguish between @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath49 $ ] , or between @xmath50 $ ] and @xmath51 $ ] orientations . as discussed in the text , we can in some cases make good estimates of which nvs share the same orientation based on their common behaviour in a uniform stress field , but it is not possible to identify unambiguously what that orientation is .",
    "there are two ways of avoiding this problem and thereby providing unambiguous identification of the nv orientations and thus the full stress tensor , subject only to the uniformity of the stress field .",
    "the first is to choose a viewing axis that provides straightforward identification of the nv orientation .",
    "for example , a @xmath16 $ ] viewing axis results in the projections of the orbital planes onto the focal plane as shown in figure [ subfigure1 ] , with four different ` ellipses ' for the four different nv orientations .",
    "the result is that the dependence of pl intensity on excitation polarisation allows simple determination of the orientation of each nv centre .",
    "conversely , other viewing axes are less conducive to the stress tensor evaluation .",
    "as shown in figure [ subfigure2 ] , a @xmath83 $ ] orientation results in a twofold ambiguity in orientation as does @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "but , more seriously , it does not allow for measurement of the angle of rotation of the @xmath84 eigenstates away from the @xmath31 axes for two of the orientations since the orbital plane is viewed edge - on .",
    "a @xmath83 $ ] viewing axis can not therefore be used to determine the full stress tensor by this method .",
    "the second approach is to resolve the ambiguity with a @xmath82 $ ] viewing axis , by applying a field which breaks the mirror symmetry in @xmath52 ( or in both @xmath83 $ ] and @xmath85 $ ] ) .",
    "this could be achieved by the temporary application of an electric field , under which the different orientations would be expected to respond differently .",
    "for instance an electric field aligned along a @xmath2 axis would allow identification of nv centres aligned parallel with that axis , as they would display a global shift of the optical transition energies but no change in splitting or polarization .",
    "the @xmath37 electronic ground state of the nv centre has a non - zero permanent dipole as a result of a small amount of mixing with the @xmath27 symmetry excited states , which gives rise to a stress and electric field dependence of the spin transitions .",
    "the components of this dipole aligned parallel and perpendicular to the nv axis have been measured as @xmath86 and @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for the ground state in the presence of local stress , plus electric and magnetic fields @xcite is given by      where as defined in figure [ figure1 ] , @xmath15 is along the nv axis and @xmath10 is in one of the three mirror planes .",
    "@xmath89 is the spin - spin interaction strength , @xmath90 is the bohr magneton , @xmath91 is the electron g - factor .",
    "@xmath92 , and @xmath93 are the components of a vector that sums the electric field and the effect of stress on a single nv centre , and @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the triplet spin operators , shown below in the @xmath5 basis      which result in spin eigenstates @xmath98 while @xmath99 .",
    "matrix elements can thus be calculated using equations , , and to write the hamiltonian in the @xmath5 basis @xmath100{ccc }      hd_{gs}+d_{gs}^{\\parallel}\\pi_z+d_{gs}^{\\perp}\\pi_x & -d_{gs}^{\\perp}\\pi_y & 0\\\\      -d_{gs}^{\\perp}\\pi_y & hd_{gs}+d_{gs}^{\\parallel}\\pi_z - d_{gs}^{\\perp}\\pi_x & 0\\\\      0 & 0 & -2(hd_{gs}+d_{gs}^{\\parallel}\\pi_z ) \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ] where we have taken the case of zero magnetic field for simplicity ( we note that , as pointed out by dolde et al in @xcite , care must be taken to minimise the magnetic field , especially its @xmath15 component , to achieve high sensitivity in these measurements ) . the effect of the combined stress and electric field on the transitions between the @xmath15 spin state and the other two eigenstates is therefore described by the secular matrix in the spin",
    "@xmath20 basis @xmath101 where @xmath102    equation above can be viewed in direct analogy with the secular matrix for the excited state as described in equation . in the absence of an electric field the same symmetry arguments that lead to equations and , expressing @xmath103 and @xmath26 for the electric dipole transitions in terms of the stress tensor components and coefficients @xmath104 , also apply here . @xmath105 and @xmath106 are therefore related in the same way to the six independent tensor components via four equivalent constants @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 . this allows us to separate the stress contribution from the electric field contribution and write      for the @xmath16 $ ] oriented centre , with stress and electric field now referred to the crystal axes , we have a set of three equations analogous to those of equation ( 2 ) , @xmath112 with the permutations for the other nv orientations as in equation . for a single nv centre , @xmath105 and @xmath106",
    "can be measured from optically detected magnetic resonance data by the shift and splitting in the spin transitions plus the orientation of the transition - inducing microwave field .",
    "the same pseudoinverse method can thus be applied to determine the full stress tensor from room temperature spin resonance data , once the constants @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 have been established .",

    "<S> the ambiguity ( effectively a mirror in @xmath52 ) in identifying the orientation of a given nv centre is not possible to resolve with this sample geometry , but as we shall see presents only a minor limitation to the results .    </S>",
    "<S> the two @xmath4 electronic transitions emit linearly polarized photons aligned with the dipole axes . </S>",

    "<S> the parameter @xmath24 is taken as the energy shift between the mid point of the two lines and 1.945 ev ( 637.5 nm ) .    as the z - projections of individual nvs are not known we performed measurements on several proximal centres and looked for groupings of parameters to identify different defect orientations . </S>",
