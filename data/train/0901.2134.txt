    "in the 15004000  k photospheres of late - type stars and early - mid l - type brown dwarfs carbon is predominantly locked up in carbon monoxide ( co ) , due to the much higher binding energy of co than that of any other carbon - bearing molecule . at temperatures of @xmath71500",
    "k , however , methane ( ch@xmath8 ) begins to be stable against collisional dissociation . as a brown dwarf cools below this temperature",
    ", the overwhelming abundance of hydrogen slowly drives the carbon that was in co into ch@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this chemical change leads to a striking transformation of the infrared spectrum of the brown dwarf and marks the division between the l and t classifications @xcite .",
    "absorption bands of ch@xmath8 together with those of h@xmath9o dominate the 1 - 2.5  @xmath10 m spectra of t dwarfs , making the @xmath11 = 2.32.5  @xmath10 m first overtone band of co , which is easily observed in k to l dwarfs , virtually undetectable by spectral type t4 @xcite , even if a significant amount of co is still present .",
    "in contrast , the fundamental vibration - rotation band of co is centered near 4.7@xmath10 m , where methane is not an important absorber . over a decade",
    "ago @xcite discovered evidence of co at 4.7  @xmath10 m at an abundance roughly three orders of magnitude larger than expected from chemical equilibrium , in the bright t7p brown dwarf gliese  229b .",
    "the discovery was promptly confirmed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the co abundance in gl  229b matched that expected at a temperature of 1250  k , roughly 400  k higher than the photospheric temperature .",
    "they interpreted the detection as evidence for vertical transport of co from hotter internal atmospheric layers to the surface , which was later supported by more detailed analysis @xcite .",
    "this finding was not unexpected , as mixing is predicted to occur in the outer , radiative zones of brown dwarf atmospheres , and the reaction(s ) moving carbon from co to ch@xmath8 are slow @xcite .",
    "recently , the @xmath0 band fluxes of numerous late t dwarfs have been measured to be up to one magnitude fainter than predictions based on their brightnesses in other wavebands and the assumption of equilibrium chemistry @xcite .",
    "this strongly indicates that the co phenomenon seen in gl 229b is common to most or all late t dwarfs .",
    "here we describe spectroscopic observations of two late - type t dwarfs , 2mass  09373487 + 2931409 ( hereafter , 2mass  0937 ) and gliese  570d , whose physical properties differ significantly from gl  229b , in order to test this hypothesis spectroscopically .    2mass  0937 and gl  229b have nearly the same spectral classifications , t6p and t7.5 , respectively @xcite . however , the @xmath12 band flux of 2mass  0937 is significantly depressed relative to gl  229b and other t6-t7 dwarfs ; e.g. , its @xmath13 color is 0.8  mag bluer @xcite .",
    "this is believed to be due to the effect of greatly enhanced collision - induced absorption by h@xmath9 ( implying that 2mass  0937 is considerably more massive than other t6-t7 dwarfs ) and/or that it has unusually low metallicity @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14 color of 2mass  0937 @xcite is close to that of gl  229b , suggesting that its photosphere does contain an enhanced abundance of co , but a spectroscopic observation is needed to verify that the this is indeed the cause .",
    "gl  570d @xcite is part of a quadruple system whose other members are low mass main sequence stars .",
    "@xcite determined an age for it of 35  gyr and a mass of 38 - 47  m@xmath15 by comparing evolutionary models of brown dwarfs and 1 - 2.5  @xmath10 m synthetic spectra of gl  570d to the known luminosity and the observed spectrum .",
    "comparison of _ spitzer _",
    "3.57.9  @xmath10 m photometry and models strongly suggests that the abundance of co is enhanced by vertical mixing @xcite .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "515@xmath16 m spectrum of gl  570d provides strong evidence for mixing also being responsible for the depletion of nh@xmath17 @xcite . in late t",
    "dwarfs the nitrogen chemistry is insensitive to the time scale of mixing in the radiative zone , because it is quenched in the convection zone deep in the atmosphere . on the other hand",
    "the carbon chemistry , and thus the abundance of co , is very sensitive to the mixing time scale . since gl  570d is significantly cooler than gl  229b and 2mass  0937 , observations of the 4.7@xmath16 m band of co",
    "provide an opportunity to determine the mixing time scale for a different set of atmospheric parameters .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "section 2 discusses the properties of the fundamental co band ,  3 presents the @xmath0 band spectroscopic observations and data reduction , and  4 covers the modeling and analysis of gl 570d and 2mass 0937 , respectively .",
    "the last section summarizes and compares the results for the two objects .",
    "in the photospheres of cool stars and `` warm '' brown dwarfs the fundamental ( @xmath18@xmath19  =  1 ) vibration - rotation band of co , as viewed at low or medium resolution , is a broad and more or less structureless absorption stretching across the entire @xmath0 band .",
    "this is the consequence of ( 1 ) several vibational levels @xmath19 being populated , ( 2 ) each @xmath18@xmath19  =  1 ( i.e. , 10 , 21 , 32 , ... ) band being successively shifted by @xmath70.06  @xmath10 m",
    "( @xmath725  @xmath20 ) to longer wavelength , and ( 3 ) the spacing of vibration - rotation lines in each @xmath18@xmath19  =  1 band being slightly different . if the rotational levels of only the ground vibrational state are populated , however , the absorption spectrum of co observed at low or medium spectral resolution will exhibit a bump ( due to minimum absorption ) around the center of the @xmath21 band at 4.665  @xmath10 m that separates the p and r branches of the band .",
    "as excited vibrational levels become more populated at higher temperatures , this absorption gap gradually disappears .",
    "the absorption gap is predicted to become noticeable at photospheric temperatures below 1500  k ; that is , at about the same temperature at which equilibrium co abundances are dropping rapidly in the photosphere of a cooling brown dwarf .",
    "thus , for a mid - late type ( t  @xmath22  1000  k ) t dwarf photosphere in chemical equilibrium , co absorption lines will be very weak and no gap will be evident . if , however , the abundance of co is considerably enhanced , then a broad absorption with a gap at the band center should be relatively prominent and detectable at moderate spectral resolution .",
    "the effect is illustrated in early non - equilibrium model spectra of cool dwarfs of @xcite .",
    "h@xmath9o also is an important absorber in the @xmath0 band , but its lines , which are irregularly spaced , tend to be spread across the @xmath0 band ( although generally increasing in strength toward longer wavelengths ) .",
    "the h@xmath9o lines may partially mask the co absorption gap at band center , but if the gap is prominent they should not entirely conceal it .",
    "@xmath0 band spectra of 2mass  0937 and gliese  570d were accumulated over several nights during 2004 - 2005 , at the frederick c. gillett gemini north telescope , using the facility near infrared imager / spectrograph , ( niri @xcite ) , which contains grisms for low resolution spectroscopy .",
    "the instrument was configured with a @xmath23 slit and a grism , which together provided a resolving power of 460 ( corresponding to @xmath18@xmath11=0.010  @xmath10 m ) in the @xmath0 band .",
    "an observing log is given in table  1 .",
    "the total exposure times were 6.1  hr for 2mass  0937 and 6.5  hr for gl  570d .",
    "observations were made in the standard stare - nod mode so that spectra were obtained alternately at two locations along the array , separated by @xmath24 .",
    "coaddition of subtracted pairs of frames then result in a final sky - subtracted image containing both a positive and a negative spectrum of the brown dwarf .",
    "positioning of the target in the slit was checked using @xmath25-band imaging and was adjusted if necessary every 45 - 60 minutes .",
    "typical adjustments were @xmath26 ; thus each brown dwarf probably was centered well within the slit at all times during most integrations . a telluric standard ( a mid f dwarf )",
    "was observed just before or just after the brown dwarf , and at an airmass that closely matched that of the brown dwarf .",
    "the seeing , as judged from the intensity profiles along the slit of bright calibration stars , ranged from @xmath27 to @xmath28 .    to our knowledge , at @xmath2912.3 ( as determined here ) gl  570d is the faintest astronomical object to have its @xmath0-band spectrum successfully observed from the ground .",
    "data reduction of @xmath0 band spectra of faint sources such as gl  570d and 2mass  0937 is difficult , because not only is the residual background in the sky - subtracted coadded spectral image considerably brighter than the brown dwarf , but also the gradient in the residual background along the slit is steep compared to the signal produced by the spectrum of the faint source , even after @xmath71  hr of integration . for these data it was necessary to extract sky rows adjacent on either side of each of the positive and negative spectra , in order to remove this gradient , prior to combining the positive and negative spectra .",
    "wavelength calibrations of the spectra were obtained from the host of strong telluric lines evident in the spectra of telluric standards obtained just before and/or after the spectra of the brown dwarfs .",
    "the accuracies of the calibrations were better than 0.001  @xmath10 m ( 3@xmath30 ) .",
    "flux calibrations utilized the 2mass @xmath31 magnitudes of the telluric standards and the very small color corrections to derive their @xmath0 magnitudes .",
    "it was assumed that the spectra of the standards and the brown dwarfs suffered identical slit losses due to seeing and guiding .",
    "that assumption might be suspect , both because the brighter stars can be more accurately centered in the slit of the spectrograph and because during the longer integration times on the brown dwarfs it is more likely that guiding `` drifts '' occur and result in higher signal losses .",
    "nevertheless , the average flux density in the 4.554.80  @xmath10 m spectrum of 2mass  0937 in fig .  1 , 5.0  @xmath320.1  @xmath33  10@xmath34  w  m@xmath35  @xmath10m@xmath36 , agrees to within several percent with the @xmath37 ( 4.55 - 4.79  @xmath10 m ) magnitude of 11.74  @xmath32  0.10 ) reported by @xcite .",
    "no @xmath37 photometry is available for gl  570d . from fig .  1 we estimate @xmath37  =  12.3@xmath320.3  mag , where the uncertainty is largely that of calibration .",
    "this value is consistent with the @xcite irac [ 4.5 ] photometry and values of [ 4.5]-@xmath37 for late t dwarfs as given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their fig .",
    "2 ) ; the uncertainty in the color is several tenths of a magnitude .    in figure  1",
    "the coadded , ratioed , and flux - calibrated spectra are binned into 0.01  @xmath10 m intervals .",
    "the spectra are qualitatively similar to the published spectra of gl  229b @xcite , but have higher signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "both have maximum flux density in the 4.64 - 4.70  @xmath10 m region , as expected if photospheric co depresses the spectrum everywhere except near the 1 - 0 band center .",
    "the wavelengths of the 1 - 0 co lines and their relative strengths , assuming optically thin lines and lte conditions for t=750 k , are shown in the upper panel of fig .  1 to illustrate the effect of the band center",
    ". lines of h@xmath38o also are expected to contribute spectral features .",
    "the model spectra ( see below ) show that the strongest h@xmath38o absorption feature in this region is at 4.68  @xmath10 m , not far from the co band center , and indeed the spectrum of each brown dwarf shows a pronounced dip at that wavelength .",
    "thus the overall shapes of the spectra constitute unambiguous detections of co in both 2mass  0937 and gl  570d .",
    "the effect of the band center is considerably more pronounced in the spectrum of gl  570d than in 2mass  0937 . in the former the flux density at the center",
    "is @xmath750% above the surrounding , whereas in the latter the contrast is roughly half of that .",
    "we analyze the @xmath0 band spectra with the goals of establishing the presence of co on a quantitative basis and determining the time scale of vertical mixing in the atmosphere .",
    "the parallaxes of both objects are known and red , near - infrared , and mid - infrared _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "spectra are available , together sampling about 70% of the total flux emitted .",
    "the distance and spectra effectively constrain the luminosity , @xmath39 , effective temperature , @xmath40 , gravity , @xmath41 , and metallicity .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "infrared spectrograph ( irs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) spectra of t dwarfs later than @xmath7t1 show nh@xmath17 features @xcite whose strengths are influenced by non - equilibrium nitrogen chemistry and thus by vertical mixing .",
    "those features are not sensitive to the time scale of atmospheric mixing , however .",
    "once other parameters have been constrained , the strength of the co 4.7@xmath16 m band can be used to find the mixing time scale . as in our previous work @xcite , we parametrize the vertical mixing time scale @xmath42 by the eddy diffusion coefficient @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the mixing scale height , assumed to be equal to the local pressure scale height @xcite .",
    "our analysis is based on the atmospheric models and mixing scheme described in @xcite and the evolution sequences of @xcite .",
    "since both gl  570d and 2mass  0937 are late t dwarfs , we assume that their atmospheres are cloudless , which is amply supported by their @xmath45 photometry and the detailed analysis of the t7p dwarf gl  229b @xcite , gl  570d @xcite , and the t8 dwarf 2mass  j0415195@xmath46093506 @xcite .",
    "the evolutionary sequences were computed with consistent surface boundary conditions provided by a grid of cloudless atmospheric models with the appropriate metallicities .      because it is a companion to a well - studied main sequence star , gl  570d has the most precisely determined physical parameters of any t dwarf to date .",
    "the k4 v primary provides an accurate distance and metallicity and a tight age constraint on the system .",
    "we obtain the basic parameters from the bolometric luminosity @xmath39 derived using the method developed by @xcite .",
    "briefly , we use the well - sampled spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and a combination of synthetic spectra and evolutionary sequences to obtain @xmath39 . given @xmath39 , the evolutionary sequences give the range of possible models @xmath47 that are consistent with the age . a detailed comparison with the observed spectrum",
    "can further limit the possible range of solutions .",
    "this is a robust method to determine @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 for t dwarfs , as the results depend only weakly on the metallicity assumed for the models , the details of the synthetic spectra , and the degree of sampling of the sed .",

    "@xcite used solar metallicity models to obtain the above parameters and we do likewise in our analysis of the @xmath0 band spectrum .",

    "spectrum shows strong ammonia features that can be accurately modeled using an nh@xmath17 abundance reduced by a factor of @xmath710 compared to that in chemical equilibrium , as expected for non - equilibrium chemistry driven by vertical mixing in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect that the @xmath0 band spectrum will show a non - equilibrium abundance of co. we have performed the analysis using a baseline model computed with the most likely values determined by @xcite , which correspond to their model c : @xmath55k , @xmath56 , and an age of 5@xmath5gyr ( solar metallicity ) .",
    "the only free parameter left to fit the @xmath0 band spectrum is the eddy diffusion coefficient @xmath57 , which determines the surface abundance of co.      there are two approaches to fitting the spectrum shown in fig .  1 with a set of synthetic spectra .",
    "the first method fits only the shape of the spectrum , i.e. the synthetic spectra are scaled by a constant multiplicative factor that is adjusted to minimize @xmath58 with the data . in this approach ,",
    "the uncertainty in the fitting parameter ( @xmath57 ) is determined by the random noise in each data point of the observed spectrum .",
    "this is estimated at @xmath59w@xmath5m@xmath60m@xmath36 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the second approach uses evolutionary sequences to obtain the radius of the brown dwarf and computes absolute model fluxes that are directly compared to the observed fluxes .",
    "this method simultaneously fits the shape of the spectrum and its overall flux level and is subject to the systematic uncertainty in the flux calibration of the data , which is estimated at @xmath61% .",
    "we compute @xmath57 and its uncertainty using both methods .",
    "with perfectly calibrated data and perfect models , both methods would give the same value of @xmath57 .",
    "we find that the flux calibration uncertainty dominates the noise when fitting the absolute fluxes .",
    "the final source of uncertainty in the determination of @xmath57 arises from the possible range of model parameters for the brown dwarf . for gl  570d , where @xmath40",
    "is narrowly constrained , this last contribution is negligible .    to account for the influence of noise on the interpretation of the spectrum",
    ", we generated 1000 simulated observed spectra by adding random gaussian noise with the above dispersion to the observed flux in each data point .",
    "each of the simulated observed spectra was fitted with a synthetic spectrum computed with the baseline model parameters and @xmath62(@xmath63/s ) ranging between 2 and 8.5 . the high resolution ( @xmath64 ) synthetic flux densities",
    "were converted to the resolution of the spectrum in fig .  1 by integration over 0.01  @xmath10 m wide bins .",

    "the flux calibration uncertainty of @xmath61% enters as @xmath71 ( @xmath72,1 , 1.3 ) and @xmath73 is the model flux renormalization . for the absolute flux fitting procedure @xmath73 was set to unity .",
    "when fitting the shape of the spectrum only , @xmath73 was adjusted to minimize @xmath58 for each value of @xmath57 .",
    "the resulting distribution of 1000 values of @xmath57 gives an average value and its dispersion .",
    "the procedure was repeated for all three values of @xmath71 ( with @xmath74 ) to quantify the effect of the uncertainty of the flux calibration .    the general behavior of the @xmath58 for these different assumptions is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "for a given value of @xmath57 , the best fit , indicated by the lowest @xmath58 value , occurs when the model fluxes are scaled to the data , i.e. when only the shape of the observed spectrum is fitted ( dotted curve ) .",
    "this curve has a broad minimum and our statistical sampling finds the minimum at @xmath75 .",
    "equilibrium chemistry ( @xmath76 ) , which @xcite found is strongly excluded on the basis of the nh@xmath17 depletion revealed by the _ spitzer _",
    "spectrum , is also strongly excluded by the shape of the @xmath0 band spectrum .",
    "this is readily seen in fig .  3 which compares the equilibrium model spectrum , which shows no detectable co , with the best - fitting non - equilibrium model spectrum .",
    "furthermore , by increasing the statistical sampling by one order of magnitude to 10,000 simulated observed spectra , we found only three simulated spectra giving @xmath77 and none below 3.8 .",
    "this illustrates the negligible likelihood that the model using chemical equilibrium is consistent with the data .",
    "if we fit the data by considering the absolute flux calibration , we find narrower distributions of @xmath58 ( solid curves on fig .  2 that depend sensitively on the flux calibration of the data .",
    "for the nominal calibration , we get @xmath78 . decreasing the absolute flux level by the estimated uncertainty of 30% we find @xmath79 .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in @xmath65 due to flux calibration is @xmath78 times larger than that due to random noise in the spectrum .",
    "consistent solutions between the two fitting methods can be obtained if the calibrated flux density is reduced by a factor of 0.65 to 0.5 , corresponding to a -1.1@xmath30 to -1.7@xmath30 correction , which is just plausible .",
    "photometric measurements of gl 570d in the mko @xmath80 @xcite and the _ spitzer _ irac [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] bands @xcite provide additional relevant information .",
    "we generated synthetic fluxes by integrating the model spectra over the bandpasses , and multiplying by @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the radius obtained from our cloudless [ m / h]=0 evolution sequences and @xmath83 is the distance @xcite .",
    "the observed magnitudes were converted to fluxes by computing zero magnitude fluxes in each bandpass with a spectrum of vega or from the flux calibration of the irac instrument .",
    "a least squares fit of the three photometric points gives @xmath84 for our nominal model ( @xmath55k , @xmath56 and [ m / h]=0 ) . this best - fitting synthetic spectrum ,",
    "its corresponding equilibrium spectrum and the photometry are shown in fig .  4 along with the @xmath0 band spectrum .",
    "the @xmath0 band spectrum in the figure is scaled by a factor of 0.83 relative to the flux - calibrated spectrum in order to minimize the residuals with the model spectrum .",
    "this is a shift of about half of the calibration uncertainty of the spectrum .",
    "the figure clearly shows the strong and broad co band , centered at 4.7@xmath16 m and complete with the bump at band center , that appears when vertical transport drives the carbon chemistry far out of equilibrium .",
    "the spectrum outside of the 4.45.0  @xmath10 m region is barely affected , however .",
    "figure  4 shows that a cloudless model with @xmath55k , @xmath56 , [ m / h]=0 and @xmath85 agrees with ( 1 ) the optical , near infrared and the 515@xmath16 m _ spitzer _ irs spectrum @xcite , ( 2 ) the mko @xmath80 and _ spitzer _ irac [ 4.5 ] photometry , and ( 3 ) the flux level of the @xmath0 band spectrum within its uncertainties .",
    "the irac [ 3.6 ] flux is too low , however .",
    "in addition @xmath86 provides a better fit to the shape of the spectrum .",
    "this latter value also fits all of the data except for the photometry . within the various sources of uncertainty , these two results for @xmath65 are barely compatible .",
    "for instance , the ( non - gaussian ) statistical distribution that led to the determination @xmath87 has only 1.6% of the sample falling within the range @xmath88 .",
    "we believe that fitting the shape of the @xmath0 band spectrum only is the more reliable way to determine the value of @xmath57 .",
    "this method depends primarily on the co / h@xmath9o abundance ratio in the photosphere and much less on modeling details while the flux level in the _ spitzer _ 4.5  @xmath10 m band is indicative of co absorption , it does not specifically point to co as the absorber and the filter is not well matched to the co band .",
    "in addition , there is no photometric data point outside of and just to longer wavelength of the co band , where absorption by h@xmath38o , which also occurs within the co band , should dominate .",
    "the photometric measurements are much more precise than the @xmath0 band spectrum calibration , however .",
    "they measure the spectral energy distribution in the vicinity of the 45@xmath16 m peak , which is strongly affected by the @xmath89 band of ch@xmath8 centered at 3.3@xmath16 m extending to @xmath90 m , and by the @xmath91 band of h@xmath9o on the long wavelength side of the peak .",
    "the ch@xmath8 line list is known to be incomplete at the temperatures of brown dwarf atmospheres .",
    "the modest success in fitting the 34@xmath16 m spectra of t dwarfs @xcite suggests that the inconsistency between the two solutions could be resolved in favor of the higher value of @xmath57 by invoking a higher ch@xmath8 opacity .",
    "indeed the incompleteness of the ch@xmath8 line list implies that the ch@xmath8 opacity in our model is a lower limit to the actual opacity .",
    "increasing the opacity in the red wing of the @xmath89 band of ch@xmath8 would nudge all three broad band fluxes in a direction that would increase the value of the best fitting @xmath57 .",
    "the flux removed from the increased ch@xmath8 absorption in the near infrared will reemerge primarily in low opacity windows .",
    "it is very likely that the shape of the 45@xmath16 m peak will be altered by flux redistribution caused by a change in the ch@xmath8 opacity , which could significantly change the value of @xmath57 that best fits the photometry .",
    "thus , we adopt @xmath92 as the most likely value for gl  570d , based on the favored nominal model parameters ( model c of @xcite ) . repeating the above analysis with the less",
    "favored but still possible values of model b of @xcite ( @xmath52k , @xmath53 ) , gives @xmath93 which is essentially identical within the uncertainty .",

    "this occurs at @xmath97 . in the upper atmosphere ,",
    "the nh@xmath17 abundance is nearly a factor of ten lower than the equilibrium value .",
    "because the eddy diffusion coefficient @xmath57 determines the mixing time scale in the _ radiative _ zone , the quenching level of the nitrogen chemistry is unaffected by the choice of @xmath57 ; rather it is determined by the convective mixing time scale . on the other hand ,",

    "the co mole fraction is @xmath99 . finally , the 4.7@xmath16 m band of co and the 1011@xmath16 m feature of nh@xmath17 probe the same level of the atmosphere , because the lines in both spectral regions are formed at @xmath1002.9 .        due to its very blue @xmath13 color ,",

    "the observed spectrum covers the intervals 0.631.01@xmath16 m , 1.031.345@xmath16 m , 1.402.53@xmath16 m and 5.1315.35@xmath16 m .",

    "the resulting uncertainty in the bolometric luminosity is @xmath113% , or 0.027 dex , where we have combined the various flux calibration uncertainties rather than treating them as statistically independent variations .",
    "we first applied our suite of solar metallicity models and found , as expected , that the model overestimate the @xmath12 band flux by about 60% , even at the highest possible gravity of @xmath114 .",
    "a better match of the near - infrared spectrum , and the @xmath12 band flux in particular , thus requires a sub - solar metallicity . applying our grid of model atmospheres , spectra , and evolution for [ m / h]=@xmath115 to the method described in @xcite and @xcite",

    "the model spectra were computed from parameters determined with the integrated spectral flux and the distance to 2mass  0937 as the only input .",

    "these small variations , which are close to the uncertainties in the present determinations , demonstrate that a more accurate determination of the metallicity of 2mass 0937 will not significantly affect the parameters given in table  2 .    the range of parameters between models a and d can not be further constrained on the basis of the near infrared spectrum . generally , the @xmath12 band flux ( e.g. , @xmath13 ) is a gravity indicator _ for a fixed _ @xmath40 .",
    "the models in table  2 are nearly constant in @xmath39 .",
    "higher gravities also imply higher @xmath40 , with compensating effects on the near infrared spectra ( fig .",

    "we have compared each of the four models in table 2 with the mid - infrared data , taking into account the spectrum of random pixel noise and the systematic @xmath122% calibration uncertainty @xcite . because there is a strong suspicion that the chemistry in the atmosphere of 2mass  0937 is driven out of equilibrium by vertical mixing",
    ", we also consider out - of - equilibrium synthetic spectra computed with the parameters of models a through d. the mid - infrared spectrum is insensitive to the choice of the vertical mixing parameter @xmath57 @xcite and we arbitrarily choose a value of @xmath123@xmath124/s . to constrain the set of @xmath47 solutions , we thus consider eight model spectra ( the four models of table  2 , with both @xmath76 and @xmath123@xmath124/s ) and the observed 5 - 15@xmath16 m spectrum with its nominal calibration , the calibration modified by @xmath111% , and finally by fitting only the shape of the spectrum , i.e. without regard of the absolute flux level .",
    "the goodness of fit of a particular model is measured by the @xmath58 , which includes the random uncertainty in the flux of each pixel .",
    "the ensemble of @xmath58 for these models reveals a clear picture . in every case ,",
    "the best of the equilibrium models ( a - d ) is a much worse fit than the best non - equilibrium model , at more than an 8@xmath30 level of significance .",
    "the irs spectrum thus rules out equilibrium chemistry for nitrogen in 2mass  0937 . for the non - equilibrium case , models a through d",
    "fit the shape of the spectrum equally well .",
    "if absolute fluxes are considered , for all choices of calibration ( within @xmath122% ) the lowest gravity model ( a ) is ruled out at @xmath125 .",
    "models b through d can provide equally good fits depending on the choice of absolute calibration . for the nominal calibration ,",
    "the best fit is obtained with model c. we conclude that the parameters of 2mass  0937 fall within the range between models b and d in table 2 and that vertical transport occurs in its atmosphere , resulting in a depletion of nh@xmath17 . the synthetic spectrum for non - equilibrium model c is shown in fig .",
    "8 as well as the best equilibrium model ( model b ) .",
    "the non - equilibrium model agrees very well with the data , although the fit is not perfect .    to summarize , combining the information in the red , near infrared , and mid - infrared spectra with the distance to 2mass  0937 we find that @xmath126 to @xmath127k , @xmath128 to 5.47 , @xmath129 , the metallicity is close to [ m / h]@xmath117 , and the age is between @xmath73 and 10  gyr .",
    "these values confirm that 2mass  0937 is a metal - poor brown dwarf with a fairly high gravity .",
    "the metallicity and gravity agree with the determinations of @xcite and @xcite but @xmath40 is substantially higher than previous determinations , except for that of @xcite .",
    "we fit the @xmath0 band spectrum of 2mass  0937 to determine the value of the eddy diffusion coefficient @xmath57 using the procedure described in  4.1.1 . in this case , the random noise in each pixel of the observed spectrum is estimated at @xmath130w@xmath5m@xmath60m@xmath36 and the systematic uncertainty in the flux calibration is estimated at @xmath61%  although the agreement with previous @xmath37 photometry is much better than this .",
    "we consider the three models b though d in this analysis . by fitting the shape of the @xmath0 band spectrum only , we find that @xmath131 for model c. the value increases slowly with @xmath119 among the suite of models but the differences with the above result remain well within the uncertainty .",
    "all three models give equally good fits to the shape of the @xmath0 band spectrum .",
    "an example of such a fit is shown in fig .",
    "9 where the non - equilibrium spectrum corresponding to model c with @xmath132 is in much better agreement with the shape of the @xmath0 band spectrum than the same model in equilibrium .",
    "the latter fails to produce the 4.665@xmath16 m bump seen in the data that indicates the presence of co. this corroborates our conclusion based on the fit of the 5 - 15@xmath16 m spectrum that vertical mixing in the atmosphere of 2mass  0937 causes the chemistry to depart from equilibrium .    by fitting absolute model fluxes to the data we obtain lower values of @xmath65 ( table 2 ) .",
    "if we rescale the observed fluxes by factors of 0.80.75 ( less than the nominal calibration uncertainty ) , then models b through d can all be made to give @xmath133 , and a consistent solution is found between fitting the shape of the @xmath0 band spectrum and its flux level .",
    "this value of the eddy diffusion coefficient corresponds to a mixing time scale of @xmath134 to 25 hours and a co mole fraction of @xmath135 .",
    "we attempted to fit the mko @xmath80 and @xmath136 magnitudes @xcite and the _ spitzer _ irac [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] fluxes @xcite as in  4.1.2 . in this case",
    "however , it was not possible to closely match the shape of the 3.55@xmath16 m peak with any of our models , not even with discarded model a ( table  2 ) , for any value of @xmath57 . in all cases , the modelled 3.3@xmath16 m band of ch@xmath8 is too deep , and the resultant @xmath80 and [ 3.6 ] fluxes are too low ( fig .",
    "values of @xmath57 that fit the [ 4.5 ] or the @xmath136 fluxes can be found but are different from each other . using the model c parameters , we find @xmath137 , but both the fit and @xmath58 are very poor , with the [ 3.6 ] flux falling several standard deviations below the irac measurement .",
    "the 3.3@xmath16 m band of ch@xmath8 can be weakened by further decreasing the metallicity , or increasing @xmath57 , but the latter to a value that is incompatible with the shape of the @xmath0 band spectrum .",
    "both of these possibilities appear unlikely , given the good agreement that we find with the spectroscopic data . a more complete line list for the ch@xmath8 band would increase the opacity and",
    "thus go in the wrong direction .",
    "the discrepancy between our best fitting model and the [ 3.6 ] and @xmath80 photometry might be attributable to the secondary effect of increasing the ch@xmath8 opacity and redistributing flux in the low opacity windows at wavelengths less than @xmath138 m into the 45@xmath16 m .      in view of the difficulty in fitting the 35@xmath16 m photometry and the likelihood that the model spectra are impacted by an incomplete ch@xmath8 linelist , we again rely on the shape of the @xmath0 band spectrum to determine the most likely value of @xmath57 , and thus conclude that @xmath139 . with the data in hand , we are unable to distinguish between models b , c , and d , as they give essentially equally good  or in the case of the photometry , equally poor  fits to the ensemble of data .",
    "model c ( @xmath140k , @xmath141 , [ m / h]=@xmath115 ) with @xmath132 as an example , provides an excellent fit to the red and near infrared spectra and to the _ spitzer _ irs spectrum as well ( fig .",
    "it also gives a good fit to the shape of the @xmath0 band spectrum ( fig .",
    "9 , although it underestimates the @xmath136 flux by @xmath142 ( fig .",
    "this model also underestimates the [ 3.6 ] , [ 4.5 ] , and @xmath80 fluxes substantially , however .    the chemical composition of the atmosphere as a function of depth is shown in fig .",
    "12 . in the region of formation of the 4.7@xmath16 m band of co ( @xmath143 ) ,",
    "vertical transport increases the co abundance by about two orders of magnitude .",
    "the nh@xmath17 abundance decreases by @xmath144dex which accounts for the large effect seen in fig .",
    "the h@xmath9o and ch@xmath8 mole fractions are barely affected by non - equilibrium chemistry .",
    "as was found for gl  570d , the nitrogen chemistry is quenched deep in the convection zone of the atmosphere ( at @xmath145 ) and thus is unaffected by the value of @xmath57 .",
    "on the other hand , the carbon chemistry is quenched much higher in the atmosphere , at @xmath146 .",
    "low resolution @xmath0 band spectra of gl 570d and 2mass 0937 clearly reveal the presence of photospheric co via the co absorption minimum between the p and r branches of the @xmath21 band .",
    "these are the first spectroscopic detections of co in late t dwarfs since the original discovery in the t7p dwarf gliese 229b .",
    "the observed spectra are well - reproduced by model spectra with co mole fractions of @xmath147 and @xmath148 , respectively .",
    "atmospheric models and synthetic spectra based on equilibrium chemistry predict that the co abundance should be too low to form a detectable co band and that instead the @xmath0 band spectrum should be dominated by h@xmath9o features .",
    "thus , the detection of prominent co absorption in the spectra of these two t dwarfs is strong evidence for the presence of vertical mixing in the radiative part of their atmospheres .",
    "this interpretation is reinforced by independent evidence for depletions of nh@xmath17 by a factor of 8 to 10 compared to the expectations from chemical equilibrium calculations in both gl  570d @xcite and 2mass  0937 (  4.2.1 ) .",
    "the concordance of deviations of the nh@xmath17/n@xmath9 and the co / ch@xmath8 ratios from chemical equilibrium in both objects can be explained consistently by a model including vertical mixing in the atmosphere and the kinetics of carbon and nitrogen chemistry .",
    "the present work firmly establishes this process in cool t dwarfs .",
    "the model spectra that include vertical mixing reproduce the entire observed seds of both dwarfs very well , with the exception of the photometry of the 45@xmath16 m peak in 2mass  0937 .",
    "similar difficulties have been encountered with 2mass j04151954@xmath460935066 ( t8 ) and 2mass j12171110@xmath460311131 ( t7.5 ) @xcite .",
    "given the overall success of our cloudless models at reproducing the seds of late t dwarfs , we think that this problem is related to well - known remaining flaws in the models . since the 45@xmath16 m peak occurs in a low opacity window , it should be sensitive to the flux redistribution that we expect will occur in models that will benefit in the future from an improved line list for ch@xmath8 at wavelengths below 1.7@xmath16 m",
    "( see fig .  7 for example ) .",
    "our non - equilibrium spectra are currently computed as post - processing on a fixed atmospheric structure computed with abundances from chemical equilibrium .",
    "a self - consistent calculation of non - equilibrium models would also redistribute the flux , but the effect should be relatively modest @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath57 and of @xmath42 derived for gl  570d and 2mass  0937 depend directly on the choice of reaction pathway for the kinetics of the carbon chemistry and on the choice of quenching scheme .",
    "as in our previous work , we have adopted the `` fast '' reaction rate of @xcite and the quenching scheme of @xcite .",
    "the latter is physically and computationally more realistic than the simple scheme that is generally applied @xcite .",
    "its application to modeling the excess co in jupiter s troposphere then requires the fast reaction rate of @xcite to reproduce the spectroscopic data @xcite .",
    "we have used those same choices for the kinetics of carbon chemistry and the quenching scheme in the past , so the present determinations of @xmath57 and our previous estimates @xcite are consistent . using",
    "the `` slow '' kinetic scheme of @xcite would result in significantly lower values of @xmath57 and longer mixing time scales .",
    "the most direct way to determine the vertical mixing time scale @xmath42 in the atmosphere with the data currently available is from the co abundance derived by fitting models to the shape of the @xmath0 band spectrum .",
    "the time scale is parametrized by the eddy diffusion coefficient , @xmath43 , for which we find @xmath149 for gl  570d , which corresponds to a mixing time scale of 0.1 to 3 hours . while the uncertainty in the mixing time scale remains large",
    ", it is crudely comparable to the measured rotation period of @xmath150  hours , where @xmath70 is the inclination of the axis of rotation to the line of sight @xcite . for 2mass 0937 , @xmath151 , implying a much longer mixing time scale of @xmath152 to 25 hours , which is also comparable to the @xmath15310 hour rotation periods of t dwarfs @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the vertical mixing process is coupled to the rotation .",
    "the eddy diffusion coefficients of these two dwarfs differ by nearly two orders of magnitude , which seems a rather large variation for two t dwarfs whose physical properties are fairly similar : @xmath154 , and @xmath155 .",
    "other properties in which there are significant differences between the two dwarfs in this study are the effective temperature , which differs by 100150@xmath5k and metallicity , where @xmath18[m / h]=0.3 to 0.4 . in the absence of a physical model for vertical mixing in brown dwarf atmospheres , it is difficult to appreciate the significance of these differences between gl  570d and 2mass  0937 . in this context ,",
    "a measure of the rotational velocity of 2mass  0937 would be of interest .",
    "eddy diffusion coefficients ( or bounds on their values ) have been derived for the atmospheres of all of the solar system giants , often by comparing models with measurements of the vertical profiles of various photochemical products .",
    "other methods have been used as well . as reviewed by @xcite , estimates for jupiter s upper stratosphere cluster around @xmath156(@xmath124/s)=6 , comparable to or larger than the values we derive here for t dwarfs , despite jupiter s four orders of magnitude smaller heat flow and nearly two orders of magnitude lower gravity .",
    "constraints have even been placed on eddy mixing in the atmosphere of neptune , where similar values of @xmath65 are inferred @xcite .",
    "such mixing in the radiatively - stable solar system stratospheres is often attributed to the propagation and/or breaking of atmospheric waves .",
    "bishop et al .",
    "review the literature in some detail and point out that @xmath57 likely varies vertically through an atmosphere , increasing with falling density .",
    "such a shortening of the mixing time scale with height would leave the quenching level and the resulting chemistry unchanged ( figs .  5 and 12 ) .",
    "as such , the @xmath57 values we derived from the observations are local values at the quenching level of the atmosphere , which is at both higher pressures and higher densities than the regions typically probed in giant planet atmospheres .",
    "the relatively similar mixing coefficients in such a great diversity of atmospheres is striking , even though the derived values apply to different atmospheric regions .",
    "further investigation of the underlying mechanisms responsible for mixing in giant planet and brown dwarf atmospheres would be of interest and may also find applicability to the study of extrasolar giant planet stratospheres .",
    "finally , we have derived the first set of well - constrained physical parameters for 2mass 0937 and have firmly established that this t6p dwarf has a subsolar metallicity and a moderately high gravity , as has long been suggested .",
    "our analysis shows that , like other late t dwarfs , its mid - infrared and @xmath0 band spectra can only be fit with models in which both the nitrogen and the carbon chemistry depart substantially from chemical equilibrium .",
    "this reinforces the conjecture that vertical mixing and the associated departures from equilibrium chemistry are common , if not ubiquitous , among late t dwarfs .",
    "the data presented here were obtained at the gemini observatory , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .",
