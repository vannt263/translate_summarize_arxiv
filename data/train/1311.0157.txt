    "in relativistic heavy ion collisions at top relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and large hadron collider ( lhc ) energies , more than 99% of the hadrons are produced with transverse momenta below 2gev , and the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) matter produced in these collisions behaves as an almost perfect liquid  @xcite .",
    "local pressure gradients convert the initial fireball deformations and inhomogeneities into fluid momentum anisotropies , which then translate into flow harmonics that describe the asymmetry of particle productions in momentum space  @xcite . the shear viscosity of the fluid controls the conversion efficiency , which leads to a suppression of elliptic flow and higher order flow coefficients as discovered by different groups  @xcite .",
    "the integrated elliptic flow of all charged hadrons @xmath2 has been used to extract the specific shear viscosity of the qgp @xmath3 since it is directly related to the momentum anisotropy of the fluid and monotonically decreases with @xmath3  @xcite . on the other hand , the differential elliptic flow @xmath4 for identified hadrons heavily depends on the chemical composition and radial flow of the system during hadronic stage of the reaction evolution . as a result ,",
    "@xmath4 for identified hadrons is more sensitive to the details of the theoretical calculation , yet it can also be used to test the extracted qgp viscosity obtained from the integrated @xmath5 for all charged hadrons .    using the vishnu hybrid model  @xcite that connects the hydrodynamic expansion of the viscous qgp fluid to the microscopic kinetic evolution of the hadronic matter , we previously extracted the qgp viscosity from the integrated elliptic flow for all charged hadrons in 200 a gev au+au collisions and provided bounds on @xmath3 , @xmath6 , where the uncertainties were dominated by the initial condition models  @xcite . within that extracted qgp viscosity range ,",
    "vishnu was able to provide an excellent description of all soft - hadron data at top rhic energy  @xcite .",
    "after extrapolating the calculations to 2.76 a tev pb + pb collisions , we demonstrated the same for the elliptic flow data for all charged hadrons measured by the alice collaboration with approximately the same or slightly higher value of the specific qgp viscosity  @xcite .",

    "the choice of initial conditions directly affects the hydrodynamic flow and thus the extracted value of the qgp specific shear viscosity .",
    "however , it does not directly influence the relative difference among the distributions of the momentum anisotropy of the different hadron species related to the mass ordering of @xmath5 . since this article does not aim to extract qgp viscosity at the lhc with reliable uncertainty estimates , but extends the previous investigations for all charged hadrons to identified hadrons , we simply follow  @xcite and use the mc - kln initialization .    for simplicity",
    ", we neglect net baryon density , heat flow , and bulk viscosity  @xcite .",

    "@xmath8 annihilation in urqmd influences kaon production by only @xmath25 , and hence the discrepancies with the measured kaon yields persist independent of whether or not @xmath8 annihilation is included .",

    "the theoretical lines are calculated with vishnu using the same input parameters as in fig .",
    "the lower panels plot the ratio of experimental and theoretical @xmath0-spectra for the three selected centralities at 0 - 5% , 30 - 40% and 70 - 80% . except for the most peripheral collisions , where we would not expect the model to perform well",

    "[ f1 ] . in spite of this normalization issue , vishnu is generally capable of correctly describing the slopes of the @xmath0 spectra for these identified hadron species , which reflect the radial flow accumulated in both the qgp and the hadronic phase , over most of the centrality range .    in figure  [ f3 ]",
    "we compare the calculated differential elliptic flow for pions , kaons and proton with experimental data from the alice collaboration .",
    "the data show @xmath26 which was extracted using the scalar product method  @xcite . with @xmath19 , ,",
    "yielding @xmath4 values for pions , kaons and protons that were slightly lower than the preliminary elliptic flow data reported by alice at the _ quark matter 2011 _ conference @xcite .",
    "after reducing @xmath14 from 0.20 to 0.16 , the calculated @xmath4 for these identified hadrons increased by @xmath25 , providing an improved description of the experimental data . ]",
    "vishnu nicely describes the identified hadron elliptic flow data up to 2gev for all shown centralities .",
    "the value of @xmath14 used here is slightly below the value @xmath27 used in our earlier work  @xcite , which was obtained from fitting the integrated and differential elliptic flow @xmath16 for all charged hadrons .",
    "the scalar product method flow measurements @xmath28 use two particle correlations , which are known to over - estimate the mean flow signal due to non - flow contributions and fluctuations .",
    "in contrast , the four particle cumulant method @xmath16 minimizes non - flow contributions and receives a negative contribution from flow fluctuations , leading to somewhat lower flow values . due to its larger flow signal compared to @xmath16 , @xmath28 therefore leads to a slightly lower value of the extracted qgp shear viscosity @xmath14 .",
    " this would indeed require an event - by - event approach .",
    "the goal here is rather to show that we can get a consistent overall description of all soft - hadron observables with a common set of parameters , and use this to make predictions for so far unpublished measurements of additional hadron species . ]",
    "the authors of @xcite previously predicted the elliptic flow for pions , kaons and protons at the lhc using a pure ( 2 + 1)-d viscous hydrodynamic calculation that employed the fluid dynamic code vish2 + 1 to describe the evolution of both the qgp and hadronic phases . with their choice of parameters , an mc - kln initialization , a constant value of @xmath29 , and a decoupling temperature @xmath30mev",
    ", they nicely predicted the later shown alice data @xcite for @xmath4 below @xmath31gev for pions and kaons for mid - central to mid - peripheral centralities bins .",
    "however , since the calculation assumed chemical freeze - out at @xmath13mev and ignored @xmath8 annihilation below @xmath32 , they over - predicted the proton yields .",
    "the _ shapes _ of the proton @xmath0 spectra were predicted reasonably well over most of the measured centrality range , except for the most central collisions where the predicted spectra lacked radial flow and were somewhat too steep .",
    "this latter problem also affected the differential flow of protons , @xmath33 , which vish2 + 1 overpredicted in central to semi - central collisions below 2gev .",
    "the microscopic hadronic rescattering processes in urqmd , contained in the vishnu hybrid model employed here , rebalance the generation of radial and elliptic flow for protons , leading to an improved description of the proton @xmath0 spectra and @xmath4 in central and semi - central collisions ; the inclusion in vishnu of @xmath8 annihilation below @xmath32 corrects the problem with the proton yields from the pure vish2 + 1 approach . the elliptic flow for pions and kaons are equally well described in both vish2 + 1 and vishnu .",
    "compared to @xmath17 used in the vishnu calculation , vish2 + 1 used a somewhat larger @xmath34 value of 0.2 for the combined qgp and hadronic evolution .",
    "apparently this successfully compensates for the larger dissipative effects in the hadronic phase that are insufficiently described in a purely hydrodynamic approach .",
    "a detailed urqmd analysis shows that protons decouple from the system later than pions and kaons  @xcite .",
    "this explains why a uniform freeze - out temperature of 120 mev ( used for pions and kaons ) fails to describe the proton data in the pure hydrodynamic approach ( at least in central to mid - central collisions ) .",
    "building upon our successful description of the @xmath0 spectra and elliptic flow of pions , kaons and protons , we now focus on the elliptic flow of the @xmath1 meson at lhc energies using the vishnu hybrid approach . fig .",
    "[ f4 ] shows a prediction for the @xmath1 meson @xmath0 spectra corresponding to the pion , kaon , and proton @xmath0 spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] . even though in urqmd @xmath1 mesons are affected significantly less by hadronic rescattering than protons ( see discussion below ) , their @xmath0 spectra exhibit a clear  flow shoulder \" , similar to that seen for protons in fig .",
    "this shows that a large fraction of the finally observed radial flow is already created in the qgp phase .    in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] we compare the differential elliptic flow @xmath1 mesons in 2.76 a tev pb+pb collisions to that of pions and protons ( shown already in fig .  [ f3 ] ) . in the vishnu calculation",
    "@xmath37 runs above the proton @xmath38 curve for @xmath39gev , but drops below at higher @xmath0 .",
    "this result agrees qualitatively with predictions by hirano _",
    "_ on the mass - ordering between proton and @xmath1 elliptic flow in 200@xmath7gev au+au collisions , using a hybrid model that couples ( 3 + 1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamics with the jam hadron cascade @xcite .",
    "in spite of the different collision energies and centralities and other differences in the two hybrid model simulations ( viscosity , longitudinal dynamics , eos and initializations ) , both calculations agree in the prediction that the @xmath1 meson elliptic flow violates the traditional hydrodynamic mass - ordering , due to a smaller rescattering cross - section in the hadron gas evolution than for protons which results in an earlier decoupling of the @xmath1 from the buildup of additional radial flow in the hadronic phase @xcite .",
    "preliminary data reported by the star collaboration @xcite for @xmath1 meson elliptic flow @xmath37 in 200@xmath7gev au+au collisions at rhic confirmed the predicted mass - ordering violation in the region @xmath40gev while recovering standard mass - ordering at higher @xmath0 .",
    "however , the crossing between the curves for @xmath37 and @xmath38 observed in @xcite happens at a lower @xmath0 value , and the splitting between proton and @xmath1 elliptic flow at higher @xmath0 is found to be significantly larger than predicted by hirano _",

    "[ f5 ] for lhc energies .",
    "forthcoming results from a measurement of @xmath37 in 2.76@xmath7tev pb+pb collisions at the lhc are expected shed further light on this matter .    to explore in greater depth the dynamical evolution of the @xmath1 meson spectra and elliptic flow in the hadronic stage we compare in fig .",

    "@xmath42mev is the switching temperature in vishnu for the transition from hydrodynamic to microscopic evolution ; setting @xmath43 thus completely eliminates the hadronic stage from the flow evolution and therefore corresponds to the limiting case of an infinitely weakly coupled hadron gas stage .",
    "the choice @xmath44mev , on the other hand , assumes the validity of hydrodynamics all the way to a very low kinetic freeze - out density and thus implements the opposite extreme of a very strongly coupled hadron gas phase .",
    "discontinuously at the switching temperature .",
    "we therefore continued the hadronic evolution with the same specific shear viscosity @xmath45 used in the qgp phase , corresponding to very , but not infinitely strong coupling in the hadronic phase . ]",
    "figure  [ f6 ] shows that the vishnu calculation including the microscopic hadron gas evolution with finite cross - sections for all hadron species , which should provide the most realistic description of the hadron gas dynamics , yields @xmath1 meson @xmath0 spectra with slopes close to the hydrodynamic curves for @xmath46mev . the @xmath47 larger @xmath1 yield in the vishnu calculation compared to vish2 + 1 arises from additional @xmath1 production via @xmath48 scattering in urqmd",
    "while @xmath1 meson decays are turned off ( otherwise no @xmath1 mesons would be left at the end of the urqmd stage ) . the @xmath1 yield shown in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] should be experimentally accessible via the dilepton decay channel of the @xmath1 , whereas a measurement through its hadronic decay channel will yield a lower yield since @xmath49 decays where one of the kaons rescatters in the hadronic phase will lead to a loss of reconstructed @xmath1 mesons .",
    "the elliptic flow of phi mesons lies between the strongly and weakly coupled hadron gas limits , but closer to the latter .",
    "this confirms that , due to its small hadronic cross sections as implemented in urqmd , the @xmath1 meson is rather weakly coupled to the hadronic medium and tends to decouple from the system almost directly after hadronization , without significant further interactions .",
    "note that neither the hybrid code vishnu nor pure hydrodynamics with @xmath44mev are able to produce a @xmath1 meson elliptic flow that lies significantly below the proton elliptic flow for transverse momenta between 1 and 2gev",
    ". it will be interesting to see whether upcoming experimental analyses support this prediction .",

    "<S> using the vishnu hybrid model that couples ( 2 + 1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamics to a microscopic hadronic transport model , we calculate the multiplicity , @xmath0 spectra and elliptic flow for pions , kaons , and protons in 2.76 a tev pb+pb collisions , using mc - kln initializations with smoothed initial conditions , obtained by averaging over a large number of events . </S>",
    "<S> the results from our calculations are compared to data from the alice collaboration , showing nice agreement over several centrality bins . using the same inputs </S>",
    "<S> , we predict the @xmath0 spectra and elliptic flow for @xmath1 mesons and explore its flow development in the strong and weak coupling limits through hydrodynamic calculations with different decoupling temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we study the influence of baryon and anti - baryon annihilation processes on common observables and demonstrate that by including annihilation processes below a switching temperature of 165 mev , vishnu provides a good description of the multiplicity and @xmath0-spectra for pions , kaons and protons measured by phenix and alice at both rhic and the lhc . </S>"
