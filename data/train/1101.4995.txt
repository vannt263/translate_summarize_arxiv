    "it has long been hoped that quantum theory of gravity , at least in some limit , allows description in terms of an effective field theory @xcite .",

    "should the effective theory of gravity be asymptotically safe , this would allow a sensible ultraviolet - complete description @xcite .",
    "however , recent observations of accelerated expansion of the universe indicate the presence of a tiny but nonvanishing cosmological constant @xcite , which presents technical hierarchy problem between ( infrared ) cosmological acceleration scale and ( ultraviolet ) planck scale , which seems irreconcilable despite the many efforts put forward @xcite .",
    "given enormous separation of cosmological and planck scales , it would seem highly dubious that quantum gravity is somehow responsible for cosmological acceleration .",
    "corrections and corresponding beta functions reviewed in @xcite originate from ultraviolet degrees of freedom ; they are planck - suppressed and irrelevant for cosmology . but the language of effective field theory is universal , and should be applicable to infrared phenomena on cosmological scales as well . to give cosmological acceleration a dynamical origin without invoking a new dark energy matter component , one would need a `` modified '' gravity , with new infrared degrees of freedom becoming active at cosmological scales , while remaining hidden in solar system and local tests .",
    "a lot has been said on the subject , with @xmath0 gravity models in particular receiving a lot of attention as of late @xcite , yet the question of large hierarchy ever remains in these attempts .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to apply the idea of renormalization group , which has been very fruitful in high energy physics , to description of these new ( and still unknown ) infrared degrees of freedom .",
    "this obviously entails the shift of attention from ultraviolet cutoff in the effective action ( [ eq : eft ] ) to the lower limit of integration  the _ infrared cutoff _ , and on how things scale when it is varied .",
    "of particular interest is the question whether it is even in principle possible to generate anomalously low scale of cosmological constant by specific running , perhaps in a way similar to dimensional transmutation phenomenon , which is what we will discuss here .",
    "analyzing renormalization flows dependent on curvature scale , we find that de sitter - like accelerated expansion can be generated even in the absence of cosmological constant term , entirely due to running of the newton s constant .",
    "this presents a novel way to view the hierarchy problem , in contrast with previous studies @xcite involving running of @xmath5 .",
    "cosmological constant should be set to zero and protected by symmetry , while de sitter asymptote is attributable to flow of newton s constant , which we describe by renormalization group equations .",

    ". instead , the hierarchy appears in _ particular solutions _ connecting local high - curvature environment ( where we seem to live right on top of ultraviolet fixed point ) and the cosmological acceleration attractor in the infrared limit .",

    "if one wishes to have asymptotically safe theory with effective cosmological constant , the renormalization group flow should connect @xmath23 line in ir to a @xmath24 fixed point in uv , while avoiding forbidden region @xmath25 .",

    "interestingly enough , einstein - hilbert action with cosmological constant , einstein - hilbert action with ultraviolet @xmath26 corrections @xcite , and original @xmath27 proposal for infrared corrections @xcite are all generated by very simple renormalization flows , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : flow]a , all of which , jumping ahead of ourselves , only differ by a single coefficient of proportionality ( [ eq : beta : power ] ) .",
    "for example , requiring @xmath28 identically in ( [ eq : derivs ] ) , we should recover general relativity action .",
    "indeed , integrating flow ( [ eq : beta ] ) with @xmath29 leads to a rational dependence of @xmath6 on curvature @xmath30 which puts back the constant term in the action @xmath31 all power - law corrections to einstein - hilbert action @xmath32\\ ] ] are in fact generated by an autonomous flow @xmath33 this could be checked by direct integration as we did above , but it is instructive to `` reverse engineer '' the flow ( [ eq : beta : power ] ) from expression ( [ eq : f : power ] ) , to see how the scale @xmath15 disappears from the flow equations . writing @xmath34 @xmath35 and formally taking logarithmic derivative @xmath36 , we obtain the expression for @xmath7 as a function of scale @xmath37 @xmath38 this by itself is simply an identical rewrite of expressions for @xmath0 and its derivative @xmath39 in new variables , but if scale @xmath37 could be eliminated in favour of the coupling value @xmath6 , the dynamical system would close and become autonomous . inverting equation ( [ eq : alpha : power ] ) , we see that @xmath7 indeed can be written as a function of @xmath6 only @xmath40 which leads to the autonomous flow ( [ eq : beta : power ] ) .    even in one - dimensional dynamical systems of the type we consider , this inversion",
    "is not guaranteed to happen .",

    "[ fig : flow]a ) , and integrating the flow leads to a power - law relationships between scale @xmath37 , coupling @xmath6 , and running @xmath7 .",
    "with respect to cosmological curvature scale , there is little difference between local environment on earth and planck scale ; both are infinitesimally close to uv fixed point , and there are no obvious reasons why the scale separation should be so large .",
    "but if approach to uv fixed point @xmath49 is slower than linear ( i.e.  @xmath51 ) instead ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : flow]b ) , integration of flow equations leads to a logarithmic dependence of coupling @xmath6 and running @xmath7 on the curvature scale @xmath37 , which means that reasonable separations of the points on the flow diagram @xmath43 can become exponentially large in physical curvature . placing an upper limit on the running @xmath7 of newton s constant in near - earth environment ( for example , by null deviation from newton s force law in torsional pendulum experiments @xcite )",
    ", we then suddenly have something to say about how far we should be removed from the infrared scale so as not to detect any running .",
    "this argument is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : bound ] ,    which shows running @xmath52 as a function of curvature scale @xmath37 for two flows , @xmath53 ( in green ) and @xmath54 ( in black ) . for example , placing an ( arbitrary ) upper limit on @xmath55 does not tell us much about the first flow , yet requires a separation of at least 30 orders of magnitude in curvature between infrared and measurement scales for the second flow .",
    "in other words , deviations from einstein gravity depend on how close we are to uv fixed point in the lab measurements , thus the smallness of cosmological constant is tied down to the observation that @xmath0 gravity reproduces einstein theory !",
    "this simple thought could be used to generate small numbers involved in the hierarchy problem in cosmological model - building ; the only thing we need to change is to make beta function quadratic in uv . to illustrate the general idea ,",
    "let s consider the simplest model of such kind , namely the one where newton s constant runs to zero with quadratic beta function in uv limit ( which is similar to running of the qcd coupling constant ) @xmath56 integrating the flow equation ( [ eq : beta : ir ] ) leads to an effective action for gravity with @xmath57 here @xmath58 is the coupling measured at curvature scale @xmath15 , and its value also determines how fast the newton s constant runs at that scale .",
    "note that @xmath15 is not really a parameter in the action , but merely the scale at which the action is evaluated .",
    "coupling @xmath6 can be renormalized to another arbitrary scale @xmath59 by redefining @xmath60 without any change to the lagrangian itself .",
    "corrections of the form ( [ eq : f ] ) already appeared in @xcite , although full implications for hierarchy were not realized then .",
    "the obvious problem with the simplistic model ( [ eq : beta : ir ] ) is that newton s constant _ actually does run _ to zero , which of course is kind of different from the expected behaviour in large curvature limit .",
    "this drawback is easily rectified if one considers newton s constant running to a constant @xmath61 integrating this flow leads to a rational function of logarithm of curvature of the form @xmath62 as before , constants in the action can be redefined by changing the reference scale @xmath15 , but the group action is slightly more complicated .",
    "running of @xmath7 with curvature scale @xmath37 is essentially the same as in simpler model ( [ eq : beta : ir ] ) , and is not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bound ] to avoid crowding the plot . while more realistic , this model is more cumbersome to analyze analytically . as far as we know ,",

    "<S> several of the well - known @xmath0 modified gravity models have remarkably simple description in terms of the infrared renormalization group , but not the `` designer '' types in general . </S>",
    "<S> we find that de sitter - like accelerated expansion can be generated even in the absence of cosmological constant term , entirely due to running of the newton s constant . in hopes of tackling the problem of cosmological constant s smallness , we explore the flows which are capable of generating exponential hierarchy between infrared and ultraviolet scales , and investigate cosmological evolution in the models thus derived .    </S>",
