    "the mathematical and computational study of complex networks has experienced tremendous growth in recent years . a wide variety of highly interconnected systems , both in nature and in the man - made world of technology , can be modeled in terms of networks .",
    "network models are now commonplace not only in the ",
    "hard \" sciences but also in economics , finance , anthropology , urban studies , and even in the humanities .",
    "as more and more data has become available , the need for tools to analyze these networks has increased and a new field of network science has come of age @xcite .    since graphs , which are abstract models of real - world networks , can be described in terms of matrices , it comes as no surprise that linear algebra plays an important role in network analysis .",
    "many problems in this area require the solution of linear systems , the computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors , and the evaluation of matrix functions .",
    "also , the study of dynamical processes on graphs gives rise to systems of differential and difference equations posed on graphs @xcite ; the behavior of the solution as a function of time is strongly influenced by the structure ( topology ) of the underlying graph , which in turn is reflected in the spectral properties of matrices associated with the graph @xcite .",
    "one of the most basic questions about network structure is the identification of the `` important '' nodes in a network .",
    "examples include essential proteins in protein - protein interaction networks , keystone species in ecological networks , authoritative web pages on the world wide web , influential authors in scientific collaboration networks , leading actors in the internet movie database , and so forth ; see , e.g. , @xcite for details and many additional examples .",
    "when the network being examined is very small ( say , on the order of 10 nodes ) , this determination of importance can often be done visually , but as networks increase in size and complexity , visual analysis becomes impossible .",
    "instead , computational measures of node importance , called _ centrality measures _ , are used to rank the nodes in a network .",
    "there are many different centrality measures in use ; see , for example , @xcite for extensive treatments of centrality and discussion of different ranking methods .",
    "many authors , however , have noted that different centrality measures often provide rankings that are highly correlated , at least when attention is restricted to the most highly ranked nodes ; see .",
    "e.g. , @xcite , as well as the results in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the relationship between degree centrality , eigenvector centrality , and various centrality measures based on the diagonal entries ( for undirected graphs ) and row sums of certain ( analytic ) functions of the adjacency matrix of the graph .",
    "these measures contain as special cases the well - known katz centrality , subgraph centrality , total communicability , and other centrality measures which depend on a tuneable parameter .",
    "we also include a brief discussion of pagerank @xcite .",
    "we point out that kleinberg s hits algorithm @xcite , as a type of eigenvector centrality , is covered by our analysis , as is the extension of subgraph centrality to digraphs given in @xcite .",
    "as mentioned , there are a number of other ranking methods in use , yet in this paper we limit ourselves to considering centrality measures based on functions of the adjacency matrix , in addition to degree and eigenvector centrality .",
    "the choice of which of the many centrality measures to study and why is something that must be considered carefully ; see the discussion in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on centrality measures that have been widely tested and that can be expressed in terms of linear algebra ( more specifically , in terms of the adjacency matrix of the network ) .",
    "we additionally restrict our scope to centrality measures that we can demonstrate ( mathematically ) to be related to one other .",
    "hence , we did not include in our analysis two popular centrality measures , betweenness centrality @xcite and closeness centrality @xcite , which do not appear to admit a simple expression in terms of the adjacency matrix .",
    "our results help explain the correlations often observed between the rankings produced by different centrality measures , and may be useful in tuning parameters when performing centrality calculations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "sections 2 and 3 contain background information on graphs and centrality measures . in section 4",
    "we describe the general class of functional centrality measures considered in this paper and present some technical lemmas on power series needed for our analysis . in section 5",
    "we state and prove our main results , which show that degree and eigenvector centrality are limiting cases of the parameterized ones .",
    "section 6 contains a brief discussion of the limiting behavior of pagerank and related techniques . in section 7",
    "we provide an interpretation of our results in terms of graph walks and discuss the role played by the spectral gap and by triangles in the network .",
    "related work is briefly reviewed in section 8 .",
    "a short summary of numerical experiments aimed at illustrating the theory is given in section 9 ( the details of the experiments can be found in the supplementary materials accompanying this paper ) .",
    "conclusions are given in section 10 .",
    "in this section we recall some basic concepts from graph theory that will be used in the rest of the paper .",
    "a more complete overview can be found , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "for ease of exposition only _ unweighted _ and _ loopless _ graphs are considered in this section , but nearly all of our results admit a straightforward generalization to graphs with ( positive ) edge weights , and several of the results also apply in the presence of loops ; see the end of section 5 , as well as section 6 .    a _ directed graph _ , or _",
    "digraph _ , @xmath0 is defined by a set of @xmath1 nodes ( also referred to as vertices ) @xmath2 and a set of edges @xmath3 .",
    "note that , in general , @xmath4 does not imply @xmath5 .",
    "when this happens , @xmath6 is _ undirected _ and the edges are formed by unordered pairs of vertices .",
    "the _ out - degree _ of a vertex @xmath7 , denoted by @xmath8 , is given by the number of edges with @xmath7 as the starting node , i.e. , the number of edges in @xmath9 of the form @xmath10 .",
    "similarly , the _ in - degree _ of node @xmath7 is the number @xmath11 of edges of the form @xmath12 . if @xmath6 is undirected then @xmath13 , the _ degree _ of node @xmath7 .",
    "walk _ of length @xmath14 in @xmath6 is a list of nodes @xmath15 such that for all @xmath16 , there is a ( directed ) edge between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "a _ closed walk _ is a walk where @xmath19 .",
    "a _ path _ is a walk with no repeated nodes , and a _ cycle _ is a closed walk with no repeated nodes except for the first and the last one .",
    "a graph is _ simple _ if it has no _ loops _ ( edges from a node @xmath7 to itself ) , no multiple edges , and unweighted edges .",
    "an undirected graph is _ connected _ if there exists a path between every pair of nodes .",
    "a directed graph is _ strongly connected _ if there exists a directed path between every pair of nodes .",
    "every graph @xmath6 can be represented as a matrix through the use of an _ adjacency matrix _",
    "@xmath20 with @xmath21    if @xmath6 is a simple , undirected graph , @xmath22 is binary and symmetric with zeros along the main diagonal . in this case",
    ", the eigenvalues of @xmath22 will be real .",
    "we label the eigenvalues of @xmath22 in non - increasing order : @xmath23 if @xmath6 is connected , then @xmath24 by the perron - frobenius theorem @xcite .",
    "since @xmath22 is a symmetric , real - valued matrix , we can decompose @xmath22 into @xmath25 where @xmath26 with @xmath27 , @xmath28 $ ] is orthogonal , and @xmath29 is the eigenvector associated with @xmath30 .",
    "the _ dominant eigenvector _ , @xmath31 , can be chosen to have positive entries when @xmath6 is connected : we write this @xmath32 .    if @xmath6 is a strongly connected digraph , its adjacency matrix @xmath22 is irreducible , and conversely .",
    "let @xmath33 be the spectral radius of @xmath22 .",
    "then , again by the perron - frobenius theorem , @xmath34 is a simple eigenvalue of @xmath22 and both the left and right eigenvectors of @xmath22 associated with @xmath35 can be chosen to be positive .",
    "if @xmath6 is also diagonalizable , then there exists an invertible matrix @xmath36 such that @xmath37 where @xmath38 with @xmath39 for @xmath40 , @xmath41 $ ] , and @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "the left eigenvector associated with @xmath30 is @xmath43 and the right eigenvector associated with @xmath30 is @xmath44 . in the case where @xmath6 is not diagonalizable",
    ", @xmath22 can be decomposed using the jordan canonical form : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the jordan matrix of @xmath22 , except that we place the @xmath47 block corresponding to @xmath35 first for notational convenience .",
    "the first column @xmath48 of @xmath36 is the dominant right eigenvector of @xmath22 and the first column @xmath49 of @xmath50 is the dominant left eigenvector of @xmath22 ( equivalently , the dominant right eigenvector of @xmath51 ) .    throughout the paper",
    ", @xmath52 denotes the @xmath53 identity matrix .",
    "as we discussed in the introduction , many measures of node centrality have been developed and used over the years . in this section",
    "we review and motivate several centrality measures to be analyzed in the rest of the paper .      some of the most common measures include degree centrality , eigenvector centrality @xcite , pagerank @xcite , betweenness centrality @xcite , katz centrality @xcite , and subgraph centrality @xcite .",
    "more recently , total communicability has been introduced as a centrality measure @xcite .",
    "a node is deemed  important \" according to a given centrality index if the corresponding value of the index is high relative to that of other nodes .",
    "most of these measures are applicable to both undirected and directed graphs . in the directed case , however , each node can play two roles : _ sink _ and _ source _ , or _ receiver _ and _ broadcaster _ , since a node in general can be both a starting point and an arrival point for directed edges .",
    "this has led to the notion of _ hubs _ and _ authorities _ in a network , with hubs being nodes with a high broadcast centrality index and authorities being nodes with a high receive centrality index .",
    "for the types of indices considered in this paper , broadcast centrality measures correspond to quantities computed from the adjacency matrix @xmath22 , whereas authority centrality measures correspond to the same quantities computed from the transpose @xmath51 of the adjacency matrix .",
    "when the graph is undirected , @xmath54 and the broadcast and receive centrality scores of each node coincide .",
    "examples of ( broadcast ) centrality measures are :    * out - degree centrality : @xmath55_i$ ] ; * ( right ) eigenvector centrality : @xmath56 , where @xmath31 is the dominant ( right ) eigenvector of @xmath22 ; * exponential subgraph centrality : @xmath57_{ii}$ ] ; * resolvent subgraph centrality : @xmath58_{ii}$ ] , * total communicability : @xmath59_i = { \\bf e}_i^t   { \\rm e}^{\\beta a}{\\bf 1}$ ] ; * katz centrality : @xmath60_{i }   = { \\bf e}_i^t ( i-\\alpha a)^{-1 } { \\bf 1}$ ] .    here",
    "@xmath61 is the @xmath7th standard basis vector , @xmath62 is the vector of all ones , @xmath63 ( see below ) , and @xmath64 .",
    "we note that the vector of all ones is sometimes replaced by a _ preference vector _",
    "@xmath65 with positive entries ; for instance , @xmath66 ( the vector of node out - degrees ) .    replacing @xmath22 with @xmath51 in the definitions above we obtain the corresponding authority measures .",
    "thus , out - degree centrality becomes in - degree centrality , right eigenvector centrality becomes left eigenvector centrality , and row sums are replaced by column sums when computing the total communicability centrality .",
    "note , however , that the exponential and resolvent subgraph centralities are unchanged when replacing @xmath22 with @xmath51 , since @xmath67 for any matrix function ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.13 ) .",
    "hence , measures based on the diagonal entries can not differentiate between the two roles a node can play in a directed network , and for this reason they are mostly used in the undirected case only ( but see @xcite for an adaptation of subgraph centrality to digraphs ) .",
    "often , the value @xmath68 is used in the calculation of exponential subgraph centrality and total communicability .",
    "the parameter @xmath69 can be interpreted as an _ inverse temperature _ and has been used to model the effects of external disturbances on the network . as @xmath70 , the  temperature \" of the environment surrounding the network increases , corresponding to more intense external disturbances .",
    "conversely , as @xmath71 , the temperature goes to 0 and the network `` freezes . ''",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for an extensive discussion and applications of these physical analogies .      the justification behind using the ( scaled ) matrix exponential to compute centrality measures can be seen by considering the power series expansion of @xmath72 : @xmath73    it is well - known that given an adjacency matrix @xmath22 of an unweighted network , @xmath74_{ij}$ ] counts the total number of walks of length @xmath14 between nodes @xmath7 and @xmath75 .",
    "thus @xmath76_{ii}$ ] , the exponential subgraph centrality of node @xmath7 , counts the total number of closed walks in the network which are centered at node @xmath7 , weighing walks of length @xmath14 by a factor of @xmath77 .",
    "unlike degree , which is a purely local index , subgraph centrality takes into account the short , medium and long range influence of all nodes on a given node ( assuming @xmath6 is strongly connected ) . assigning decreasing weights to longer walks",
    "ensures the convergence of the series ( [ sc ] ) while guaranteeing that short - range interactions are given more weight than long - range ones @xcite .",
    "total communicability is closely related to subgraph centrality .",
    "this measure also counts the number of walks starting at node @xmath7 , scaling walks of length @xmath14 by @xmath77 .",
    "however , rather than just counting closed walks , total communicability counts all walks between node @xmath7 and every node in the network .",
    "the name stems from the fact that @xmath78 where @xmath79_{ij}$ ] , the communicability between nodes @xmath7 and @xmath75 , is a measure of how  easy \" it is to exchange a message between nodes @xmath7 and @xmath75 over the network ; see @xcite for details .",
    "although subgraph centrality and total communicability are clearly related , they do not always provide the same ranking of the nodes . furthermore , unlike subgraph centrality , total communicability can distinguish between the two roles a node can play in a directed network .",
    "more information about the relation between the two measures can be found in @xcite .",
    "the matrix resolvent @xmath80 was first used to rank nodes in a network in the early 1950s , when katz used the column sums to calculate node importance @xcite . since then",
    ", the diagonal values have also been used as a centrality measure , see @xcite .",
    "the resolvent subgraph centrality score of node @xmath7 is given by @xmath81_{ii}$ ] and the katz centrality score is given by either @xmath82_{i}$ ] or @xmath83_{i}$ ] , depending on whether hub or authority scores are desired .",
    "as mentioned , @xmath84 may be replaced by an arbitary ( positive ) preference vector , @xmath65 .",
    "as when using the matrix exponential , these resolvent - based centrality measures count the number of walks in the network , penalizing longer walks .",
    "this can be seen by considering the neumann series expansion of @xmath80 , valid for @xmath63 : @xmath85 the resolvent subgraph centrality of node @xmath7 , @xmath81_{ii}$ ] , counts the total number of closed walks in the network which are centered at node @xmath7 , weighing walks of length @xmath14 by @xmath86 .",
    "similarly , the katz centrality of node @xmath7 counts all walks beginning at node @xmath7 , penalizing the contribution of walks of length @xmath14 by @xmath86 .",
    "the bounds on @xmath87 ( @xmath63 ) ensure that the matrix @xmath88 is invertible and that the power series in ( [ eq : powerseries ] ) converges to its inverse . the bounds on @xmath87 also force @xmath80 to be nonnegative , as @xmath89 is a nonsingular @xmath90-matrix .",
    "hence , both the diagonal entries and the row / column sums of @xmath80 are positive and can thus be used for ranking purposes .",
    "in this section we establish precise conditions that a matrix function @xmath91 , where @xmath22 is the adjacency matrix of a network , should satisfy in order to be used in the definition of walk - based centrality measures .",
    "we consider in particular analytic functions expressed by power series , with a focus on issues like convergence , positivity , and dependence on a tuneable parameter @xmath92 .",
    "we also formulate some auxiliary results on power series that will be crucial for the analysis to follow . for an introduction to the properties of analytic functions",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "as discussed in subsection [ subsec : walks ] , walk - based centrality measures ( such as katz or subgraph centrality ) lead to power series expansions in the ( scaled ) adjacency matrix of the network . while exponential- and resolvent - based centrality measures are especially natural ( and well - studied ) , there are _ a priori _ infinitely many other matrix functions which could be used @xcite",
    ". not every function of the adjacency matrix , however , is suitable for the purpose of defining centrality measures , and some restrictions must be imposed .",
    "a first obvious condition is that the function should be defined by a power series with _",
    "real _ coefficients .",
    "this guarantees that @xmath93 takes real values when the argument is real , and that @xmath91 has real entries for any real @xmath22 . in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , the authors proposed to consider only analytic functions admitting a maclaurin series expansion of the form @xmath94    this ensures that @xmath91 will be nonnegative for any adjacency matrix @xmath22 . in @xcite",
    "it is further required that @xmath95 for all @xmath96 , so as to guarantee that @xmath97_{ij}>0 $ ] for all @xmath98 whenever the network is ( strongly ) connected .",
    "matrix @xmath22 is irreducible if and only if @xmath99 .",
    "see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 6.2.24 ) . ]",
    "although not explicitly stated in @xcite , it is clear that if one wants _ all _ the walks ( of any length ) in @xmath6 to make a positive contribution to a centrality measure based on @xmath100 , then one should impose the more restrictive condition @xmath95 for all @xmath101 .",
    "note that @xmath102 plays no significant role , since it s just a constant value added to all the diagonal entries of @xmath91 and therefore does not affect the rankings .",
    "however , imposing @xmath103 guarantees that all entries of @xmath91 are positive , and leads to simpler formulas .",
    "another tacit assumption in @xcite is that only power series with a positive radius of convergence should be considered .    in the following",
    ", we will denote by @xmath104 the class of analytic functions that can be expressed as sums of power series with strictly positive coefficients on some open neighborhood of @xmath105 .",
    "we note in passing that @xmath104 forms a _ positive cone _ in function space , i.e. , @xmath104 is closed under linear combinations with positive coefficients .",
    "clearly , given an arbitrary adjacency matrix @xmath22 , the matrix function @xmath91 , with @xmath106 , need not be defined ; ndeed , @xmath100 must be defined on the spectrum of @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath100 is entire ( i.e. , analytic in the whole complex plane , like the exponential function ) then @xmath91 will always be defined , but this is not the case of functions with singularities , such as the resolvent . however",
    ", this difficulty can be easily circumvented by introducing a ( scaling ) parameter @xmath107 , and by considering for a given @xmath22 the parameterized matrix function @xmath108 only for values of @xmath107 such that the power series @xmath109 is convergent ; that is , such that @xmath110 , where @xmath111 denotes the radius of convergence of the power series representing @xmath100 . in practice , for the purposes of this paper , we will limit ourselves to _ positive _ values of @xmath107 in order to guarantee that @xmath112 is entry - wise positive , as required by the definition of a centrality index .",
    "we summarize our discussion so far in the following lemma .",
    "0.05 in    [ lemma1 ] let @xmath104 be the class of all analytic functions that can be expressed by a maclaurin series with strictly positive coefficients in an open disk centered at @xmath105 .",
    "given an irreducible adjacency matrix @xmath22 and a function @xmath113 with radius of convergence @xmath114 , let @xmath115 .",
    "then @xmath112 is defined and strictly positive for all @xmath116 .",
    "if @xmath100 is entire , then one can take @xmath117 .",
    "0.05 in    restriction of @xmath100 to the class @xmath104 and use of a positive parameter @xmath107 , which will depend on @xmath22 and @xmath100 in case @xmath100 is not entire , allows one to define the notion of @xmath100-centrality ( as well as @xmath100-communicability , @xmath100-betweenness , and so forth , see @xcite ) .",
    "exponential subgraph centrality ( with @xmath118 ) is an example of an entire function ( hence all positive values of @xmath69 are feasible ) , while resolvent subgraph centrality ( with @xmath119 ) exemplifies the situation where the parameter must be restricted to a finite interval , in this case @xmath120 ( since the geometric series @xmath121 has radius of convergence @xmath122 ) .",
    "we consider now two subclasses of the class @xmath104 previously introduced .",
    "we let @xmath123 denote the set of all power series in @xmath104 with radius of convergence @xmath124 , and with @xmath125 the set of all power series with finite radius of convergence @xmath111 such that @xmath126 ( we note that the first equality above follows from abel s theorem @xcite ) .",
    "the exponential and the resolvent are representative of functions in @xmath123 and @xmath125 , respectively .",

    "the following technical lemmas will be crucial for our analysis .",

    ". then @xmath154 where @xmath155 and @xmath111 is the radius of convergence of the series defining @xmath100 around @xmath105 ( finite or infinite according to whether @xmath156 or @xmath157 , respectively ) .",
    "consider first the case @xmath158 . in this case",
    "the assumption that @xmath159 guarantees ( cf .",
    "( [ cond ] ) ) that the denominator of ( [ asy ] ) tends to infinity , whereas the numerator remains finite for all @xmath160 and all @xmath75 .",

    "the limit ( [ asy ] ) with @xmath177 will be instrumental in our analysis of undirected networks , while the general case is needed for the analysis of directed networks .",
    "one difficulty in measuring the `` importance '' of a node in a network is that it is not always clear which of the many centrality measures should be used .",
    "additionally , it is not clear a priori when two centrality measures will give similar node rankings on a given network .",
    "when using parameter - dependent indices , such as katz , exponential , or resolvent - based subgraph centrality , the necessity of choosing the value of the parameter adds another layer of difficulty .",
    "for instance , it is well known that using different choices of @xmath87 and @xmath69 in katz and subgraph centrality will generally produce different centrality scores and can lead to different node rankings .",
    "however , experimentally , it has been observed that different centrality measures often provide rankings that are highly correlated @xcite .",
    "moreover , in most cases , the _ rankings _ are quite stable , in the sense that they do not appear to change much for different choices of @xmath87 and @xmath69 , even if the actual _ scores _ may vary by orders of magnitude @xcite . with katz and subgraph centrality",
    "this happens in particular when the parameters @xmath87 and @xmath69 approach their limits : @xmath178 noting that the first derivatives of the node centrality measures grow unboundedly as @xmath179 and as @xmath71 , the centrality scores are extremely sensitive to ( vary extremely rapidly with ) small changes in @xmath87 when @xmath87 is close to @xmath180 , and in @xmath69 when @xmath69 is even moderately large .",
    "yet , the rankings produced stabilize quickly and do not change much ( if at all ) when @xmath87 and @xmath69 approach these limits .",
    "the same is observed as @xmath181 .",
    "the remainder of this section is devoted to proving that the same behavior can be expected , more generally , when using parameterized centrality measures based on analytic functions @xmath106 .",
    "the observed behavior for katz and subgraph centrality measures is thus explained and generalized .",
    "it is worth noting that while all the parameterized centrality measures considered here depend continuously on @xmath182 , the rankings do not : hence , the limiting behavior of the ranking as the parameter tends to zero can not be obtained by simply setting the parameter to zero .",
    "we begin with the undirected case .",
    "the following theorem is our main result .",
    "it completely describes the limiting behavior , for  small \" and  large \" values of the parameter , of parameterized functional centrality measures based on either the diagonal entries or the row sums .",
