    "then , @xmath13 and @xmath14    this approach can be applied for investigation , not only exclusive processes but also for the calculation of higher twist ( ht ) corrections to some inclusive processes , such as large-@xmath15 dilepton production [ 4 ] , two - jet+meson production in the electron - positron annihilation [ 5 ] , etc . the ht corrections to a single meson inclusive photoproduction and jet photoproduction cross sections were studied by various authors [ 6,7 ] . in these early papers for calculation of integrals over @xmath13 , like    @xmath16    which appear in an expression of the amplitude , the frozen coupling constant approximation was used .",
    "some comments are in order concerning this point .",
    "it is well known [ 8 ] , that in pqcd calculations the argument of the running coupling constant ( or the renormalization and factorization scale ) @xmath17 should be taken equal to the square of the momentum transfer of a hard gluon in a corresponding feynman diagram . but defined in this way , @xmath18 suffers from infrared singularities . indeed , in a meson form factor calculations , for example , @xmath19 equals to @xmath20 or @xmath21 , @xmath22 being the four momentum square of the virtual photon . in the single meson photoproduction @xmath23 , this scale has to be chosen equal to @xmath24 or @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are the subprocess s mandelstam invariants [ 6 ] .",
    "therefore , in the soft regions @xmath27 or @xmath28 integrals ( 1 ) diverge and for their calculation some regularization methods of @xmath29 in these regions are needed . in the frozen coupling approximation",

    "first of all , it is instructive to compare sources of the infrared renormalons in our case and in other qcd processes considered in [ 17 ] . in these articles",

    "; there are no gluon loops in the corresponding feynman diagrams in @xmath36 .",
    "it is not accidental that @xmath168 ( 25 ) in our case has exactly @xmath171 dependence and , hence , the expressions ( 30),(32),(35),(36 ) are exact sums of the corresponding perturbative series . in [ 17 ] it has been demonstrated that the only source of terms of order @xmath172 in ( 25 ) is the running coupling constant .",
    "the source of these terms in the ht calculations is also the running coupling @xmath173 ( or @xmath174 ) , which runs due to the integration in ( 1 ) over the meson quark s ( antiquark s ) longitudinal fractional momentum , but not because of a loop integration .",
    "another question commonly discussed in papers involving ir renormalons is an ambiguity produced by the principal value prescription used for the regularization of divergent integrals ( 28 ) .",
    "the ambiguity introduced by our treatment of ( 28 ) is a higher twist and behaves as @xmath175 ( the first renormalon pole is @xmath176 ) .",
    "but the subprocess under consideration itself is already the higher twist one .",
    "therefore , we can safely ignore such `` ht - to - ht '' corrections .    at the end of this section",
    "let us write down the ht correction to the single meson photoproduction cross section by taking into account both ht subprocesses ; @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that the second subprocess cross section can be obtained from ( 9),(10 ) by @xmath179 replacement .",
    "then the ht correction to the single meson photoproduction cross section is given by @xmath180 where @xmath181 here the sum runs over the hadron s quark @xmath182 and antiquark @xmath183 flavors . in ( 37 ) @xmath184 , @xmath185 are the quark and antiquark distribution functions , respectively . all r.h.s .",

    "in our study of the single meson photoproduction a crucial point is the comparison of our results with leading twist ( lt ) ones .",
    "this will enable us to find such domains in the phase space in which the higher twist photoproduction mechanism is actually observable .",
    "the lt subprocesses , which contribute to a meson photoproduction are : + a photon - quark ( antiquark ) scattering @xmath189 and photon - gluon fusion reactions @xmath190 in this article we consider the inclusive cross section difference in the photon - proton collision , namely @xmath191 the lt subprocess which dominates in this difference is @xmath192 with @xmath193 .",

    "this means that the k - factor for the cross section difference is less than 1 .",
    "in other words , using the lt cross section ( 42 ) for calculations of @xmath211 at the same or slightly different kinematic regimes , we only underestimate the ratio @xmath212 and related quantities and give lower bounds for them .",
    "the second problem solved by our choice of @xmath203 is a contribution to the photoproduction cross section originating from the photon s quark and gluon content .",
    "it is well known that the photoproduction process @xmath213 may proceed via two distinct mechanisms ; photon can interact either directly with the hadron s partons ( direct photoproduction ) , or via its quark and gluon content ( resolved photoproduction ) . as was demonstrated in [ 18 ] ,",
    "the contribution from the resolved photoproduction almost completely cancel in the @xmath214 difference .",

    "our calculations are performed for @xmath233 at @xmath234 .    in this work , for quark distribution functions ,",
    "we borrow the leading order parametrization of owens [ 19 ] .",

    "the same is also true for @xmath237 in the lt cross section ( 43 ) .",

    "the same reason will enable us to compute @xmath239 ignoring a contribution from the leading twist subprocess @xmath240 , which otherwise may be considerable .",
    "the quark fragmentation functions are taken from [ 20 ] . recently , in [ 21 ] , a new set of fragmentation functions for charged pions and kaons , both at leading and next - to - leading order , have been presented .",
    "these functions give @xmath241 , but not @xmath242 .",
    "therefore , we can not apply them in our calculations .",
    "the other problem is a choice of the qcd scale parameter @xmath243 and number of active quark flavors @xmath244 .",
    "the ht subprocesses probe the meson w.f . over a large range of @xmath245 ,",

    "scales @xmath249 used in ( 42 ) as arguments of @xmath196 in the lt cross section we get @xmath250    in other kinematic domains these scales take essentially larger values . taking into account these facts we find it reasonable to assign @xmath251 throughout in this section .",
    "results of our numerical calculations are plotted in @xmath252 .",
    "first of all , it is interesting to compare the resummed ht cross sections with the ones obtained in the framework of the frozen coupling approximation . in @xmath253 , the ratio @xmath254 for negatively charged particles @xmath255",
    "is shown . in the computing of @xmath256",
    "we have neglected the meson s w.f .",
    "dependence on the scale @xmath9 .",
    "let us emphasize that for the kaon we have used the frozen coupling version of our expression ( 9 ) , but not the bagger - gunion formula from [ 6 ] , which is incorrect in that case .",
    "as is seen from @xmath257 , @xmath258 almost for all @xmath15 , whereas @xmath259 falls from @xmath260 at @xmath261 until @xmath262 at @xmath263 and from @xmath264 at @xmath265 till @xmath266 at @xmath267 . for @xmath230",
    "this ratio demonstrates also a sharp dependence on @xmath268 at fixed @xmath269 @xmath270 .",
    "in all of the following figures we have used the resummed expression for the ht cross section . in @xmath271 the ratio @xmath272 is depicted . for all particles the lt cross section difference is positive @xmath273 , since @xmath274 , while @xmath275 . the smaller quark charge @xmath276 and the smaller distribution function @xmath277 both suppress @xmath205 [ 6 ] .",
    "the ht cross section difference may change sign at small @xmath15 and become negative @xmath278 .",
    "for example , @xmath279 at @xmath280 for @xmath281 and at @xmath282 for @xmath283 . only at the phase - space boundary @xmath284 in the first case or at @xmath285 in the second one @xmath286",
    ". therefore , we plot the absolute value of @xmath212 .",
    "the similar picture has been also found for other mesons .    as is seen from @xmath287 for pion and kaon",
    "the ht contribution is comparable with the lt one only at @xmath288 .",
    "we do not find a considerable and stable growth of ht contributions at large values of @xmath15 for all the cross section differences @xmath289 , as well as , for all @xmath290 .",
    "thus , @xmath291 is small at high @xmath15 for different @xmath186 @xmath292 . at the same time",
    "@xmath293 is a rising function of @xmath15 for @xmath294 and @xmath295 .",
    "the cross section differences @xmath206 and @xmath296 as functions of @xmath15 are shown in @xmath297 .",
    "for the pion the total cross section difference @xmath298 in the region of small @xmath15 is smaller than @xmath299 due to @xmath300 in this region @xmath301 .",
    "but for kaon @xmath302 in the same kinematic domain . for both mesons",
    "the difference between @xmath303 and @xmath206 cross sections is small .",
    "the rapidity dependence of @xmath212 at @xmath304 plotted in @xmath305 illustrates not only the tendency of the ht contributions to be enhanced in the region of negative rapidity , but also reveals an interesting feature of the ht terms ; as is seen from @xmath305 the ratio @xmath212 is an oscillating function of the rapidity .",
    "this property of the ht terms may have important phenomenological consequences .",
    "in fact , in @xmath306 we have depicted @xmath303 and @xmath206 versus rapidity . in both cases , owing to observed property of @xmath307 , in certain domains of the rapidity interval @xmath308 the total cross section difference is more than @xmath206 and in some ones less than @xmath206 . in the case of the kaon photoproduction @xmath309",
    "the properties of the ht terms found in the pion and kaon photoproduction processes persist also in the @xmath45-meson photoproduction .",
    "but now the ht contributions change the whole picture of the process arising from the ordinary lt calculations .",
    "thus , as in the case of the pion photoproduction , the ht terms are enhanced relative to the leading ones and @xmath310 almost for all @xmath15 .",
    "but now @xmath311 takes such large values that it even changes the sign of the total cross section difference .",
    "that is , if in accordance with the lt estimations @xmath312 must be valid for all @xmath15 , for @xmath313 we find @xmath314 .",
    "the value of @xmath315 depends on the process parameters , as well as on the @xmath45-meson w.f .",
    "used in calculations . at @xmath316",
    "we have @xmath317 .",
    "our results are shown in @xmath318 .",
    "for the parameters indicated in the figure a critical value of @xmath15 is : @xmath319 for cz w.f . , and @xmath320 for bb w.f .",
    "in all kinematic domains the ht contributions found using bb w.f .",
    "exceed the ones obtained by applying cz w.f .",
    ", that is , @xmath321 .",
    "for example , the ratio @xmath322 equals to @xmath323 at @xmath324 , or to @xmath325 at @xmath326 .",
    "our results confirm the conclusion made by the authors in [ 13 ] concerning a possibility of increasing the rate of the production of transversely polarized @xmath45-meson .",
    "similar pictures persist in @xmath327 , where @xmath328 and @xmath329 are depicted as functions of the rapidity y. in @xmath330 , for the process parameters @xmath331 we have : in domain @xmath332 the total cross section difference for cz w.f .",
    "is negative , in @xmath333  -   @xmath334 . in @xmath335",
    "the same is shown for @xmath336 . in two other regions lying outside of @xmath337 the @xmath338 exceeds @xmath339 ( for @xmath340 , @xmath341 and for @xmath342 , @xmath343 are negligible and are not shown ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that in [ 6 ] the authors considered the @xmath45-meson photoproduction at the same process s parameters and predicted @xmath344 at @xmath288 , but could not find similar effects for @xmath345 in dependence on the rapidity .",
    "our investigations prove that @xmath344 at @xmath313 and @xmath315 well into deep perturbative domain .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the same phenomenon exists for @xmath346 .",
    "in this work we have calculated the single meson inclusive photoproduction via higher twist mechanism and obtained the expressions for the subprocess @xmath347 cross section for mesons with both symmetric and non - symmetric wave functions . for the calculation of the cross section we have applied the running coupling constant method and revealed ir renormalon poles in the cross section expression .",
    "ir renormalon induced divergences have been regularized by means of the principal value prescription and the resummed expression ( the borel sum ) for the higher twist cross section has been found .",
