    "consider a @xmath2-dimensional lattice of ising spins , evolving under glauber dynamics at a fixed temperature @xmath11 from a random initial configuration .",
    "this is obtained e.g. by quenching the system from very high temperature down to @xmath11 .",
    "the purpose of this work is to study the influence of temperature on the statistical properties of the sum @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the spin at a given site .",
    "more precisely , we shall investigate two facets of this problem :    * the scaling of @xmath3 with @xmath14 , and more generally the _ bulk _ properties of the distribution of @xmath3 , * the statistics of rare events ( such as large deviations , first passages , persistence ) , i.e. the _ tail _ properties of this distribution .",
    "equivalent writings of the sum are @xmath15 , where @xmath16 are the lengths of time spent by the spin @xmath17 in the positive ( negative ) direction , or occupation times of the @xmath18 states , with @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the temporal mean of @xmath17 , or local mean magnetization . if one views @xmath17 as the steps of a fictitious random walker , then @xmath3 is the position of the random walker at time @xmath14 , and @xmath20 its mean speed .",
    "simple as it may seem , the problem thus stated is actually very intricate .",
    "the reason is that , the values of @xmath17 at different instants of time being in general correlated , this study pertains to that of sums of correlated random variables , for which no universal result exists .",
    "the central limit theorem holds only for weakly correlated random variables .",
    "as we shall see , @xmath3 obeys the central limit theorem for @xmath4 , while the latter is violated for @xmath21 .",
    "hereafter , we focus our attention on the asymptotic behaviour of the following quantities , as @xmath22 . * ( i ) * the probability distribution of @xmath23 , or alternatively that of @xmath24,given by @xmath25 with corresponding densities , related by @xmath26 assume that the typical value of @xmath23 scales , for long times , as @xmath27 . by definition of @xmath23 , @xmath28 necessarily . then , if @xmath29 , the events @xmath30 , with @xmath31 , are rare .",
    "( or the events @xmath32 with @xmath33 . ) the tail probability @xmath34 , which measures their weight , is vanishingly small , as @xmath35 .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath36 , @xmath34 is expected to converge to a limiting distribution , i.e. , the distribution of @xmath23 has fat tails .",
    "the former case corresponds to @xmath37 , the latter to @xmath38 , as detailed below .    *",
    "( ii ) * the first - passage probability @xmath39 which is the probability for the random walker not to cross the line @xmath40 , up to time @xmath14 .",
    "this is also referred to as the probability of _ persistent large deviations _ , sinceit involves the large - deviation event @xmath41 , and the persistence condition @xmath42for all @xmath43 .",
    "special cases of these quantities are , first , the probability of first passage of @xmath3 by the origin @xmath44 and , secondly , the persistence probability of the process @xmath45 ( assuming that @xmath46 ) @xmath47 which is also formally equal to @xmath48 .",
    "the principal motivation behind such an investigation comes from the problem of _ phase persistence _ , where , for a system undergoing phase ordering , the question posed is : _",
    "`` what is the probability for a given point of space to remain in the same phase as time passes?''_.    for the particular case of @xmath49 , say for a spin model , the question above is answered by the knowledge of @xmath50 , which decays at long times as @xmath51 , thus defining the persistence exponent @xmath7 @xcite . however , as shown in @xcite , consideration of the more general events @xmath41 , beyond that of the most extreme event @xmath52 ( the spin never flipped ) , allows both a stationary definition of the persistence exponent @xmath7 , as the edge singularity of @xmath53 , for @xmath54 , and the introduction of a whole spectrum of exponents @xmath8 , through the temporal decay of @xmath55 .",
    "the interest of introducing such concepts is strengthened by the fact that , for @xmath56 , the same definition of the persistence exponent holds , now for @xmath57 @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "in essence , the change in viewpoint when considering @xmath34 and @xmath55 instead of @xmath50 amounts to shifting from the original question posed above to the more general one : _ `` how long did the system remain in a given phase?''_. this means in particular searching the distribution of the length of time spent by the system inthe given phase , or occupation time of the phase , directly related to the sum ( [ sum ] ) .",
    "the statistics of the occupation time provides information on the ergodic nature of the process .",
    "further developments on this theme can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite to @xcite .",
    "this work is a sequel and a completion of @xcite .",
    "we investigate the behaviour of the distribution of @xmath23 and of @xmath55 in the three temperature regimes , @xmath58 , @xmath5 , and @xmath38 , and in particular revisit the question of the definition of the persistence exponent in the low - temperature phase .",
    "we will mainly consider here the two - dimensional case , and incidentally comment on the case @xmath59 .",
    "in its heat - bath formulation , glauber dynamics consists in updating the spin @xmath17 , located at a given site , with the probability @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the local field at the given site , equal to the sum of the neighbouring spins . under this dynamics spins thermalize in their local environment .",
    "the behaviour of the system is qualitatively different according to the value of the temperature at which the dynamics takes place , that is the temperature @xmath11 after the quench .",

    "in the regime @xmath148 , the autocorrelation function scales as @xmath190 according to this hypothesis @xcite , all the temperature dependence is factored out in the prefactor @xmath191 .",

    "the central limit theorem can be violated in essentially two ways . either by adding identically distributed random variables , all of the same orderof magnitude , i.e. with a narrow common distribution , but otherwise strongly correlated . or by adding independent identically distributed random variables , with a broad common distribution .",
    "the violation of the central limit theorem for @xmath23 at @xmath49 can be viewed in either of these two ways .",
    "on one hand , by its very definition , @xmath23 is the sum of the correlated random variables @xmath258 , as discussed in this paper . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath23 can also be viewed as the alternating sum of the intervals of time @xmath260 , @xmath261 , between two sign changes of @xmath258 , which are broadly distributed .",
    "though these intervals of time are not independent , the violation of the central limit theorem is nevertheless essentially due to the algebraic tail @xmath262 of their distribution .",
    "the case @xmath263 is more difficult to interpret this way because of the occurrence of thermal flips .",
    "a natural model to consider however , is one where the intervals of time @xmath264 are independent with distribution @xmath265 @xcite .",
    "though this is a simplification of reality , it leads nevertheless to the same classification of behaviours for @xmath266 and @xmath267 as summarized above , with respectively @xmath268 corresponding to @xmath58 , @xmath269 to @xmath5 and @xmath270 to @xmath38 @xcite ."
