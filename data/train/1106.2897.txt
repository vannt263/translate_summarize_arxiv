    "determining the stellar origins of supernovae ( sne ) is one of the most compelling areas of modern astrophysics .",

    "letter _ , we consider initial results on the progenitor of sn 2011dh / ptf11eon in m51 .",
    "sn 2011dh was discovered independently by several amateur astronomers and by the palomar transient factory ( ptf ) collaboration between may 31 and june 1 ( ut dates are used throughout ) , within @xmath61 day of explosion ; see @xcite and references therein .",

    "the sn has been further classified as type iib @xcite .",
    "sn 2011dh is being intensely studied at a number of wavelengths .",
    "for instance , the sn was detected early by @xcite with the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) and by @xcite with the ultraviolet - optical telescope ( uvot ) on _ swift _ ; by @xcite with the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) ; and by @xcite with the expanded very large array ( evla ) .",
    "@xcite also present early panchromatic sn observations .",
    "the sn position at cm wavelengths is @xmath7(j2000 ) = @xmath10 , @xmath11(j2000 ) = @xmath12 ( @xmath13 in each coordinate ) .",
    "it is offset @xmath14 e and @xmath15 s from the nucleus of m51a ( ngc 5194 ; @xmath16 , @xmath17 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , along a prominent spiral arm .",
    "@xcite have argued that sne  iib can arise from progenitor stars with two very different radii , extended and compact .",
    "@xcite concluded that the sn iib 1993j progenitor was a massive k0-type supergiant , with bolometric magnitude @xmath18 .",
    "the radius of the star was extended , @xmath19 cm @xcite .",
    "the sn 1993j properties could be well explained by an interacting binary system model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; furthermore , the progenitor companion appears to have been recovered spectroscopically a decade later @xcite .",
    "@xcite report on the detection of the shock - breakout cooling tail for sn 2011dh , which was also seen for sn 1993j @xcite .",
    "however , the more rapid decline in the early light curve and the much lower temperature inferred from the sn 2011dh spectra , than was observed for sn 1993j ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicates that the sn 2011dh progenitor was likely more compact , with radius @xmath20 cm .",
    "in fact , spectroscopically sn 2011dh more closely resembles the sn iib 2008ax @xcite , the progenitor of which @xcite estimated to have had a radius @xmath0 cm . @xcite",
    "suggest a radius @xmath0 cm for the sn 2011dh progenitor as well .",
    "we find this evidence for a compact sn 2011dh progenitor to be plausible and have assumed it to be the case in this _",

    "we undertake a more extensive analysis and attempt to constrain the properties of the sn progenitor system .",
    "the nearly face - on m51 , the `` whirlpool galaxy , '' also hosted the type i sn 1945a , type ic sn 1994i , and type ii - plateau ( ii - p ) sn 2005cs .",

    "m51 was observed on 2005 january 2021 by the hubble heritage team ( go / dd 10452 ; pi : beckwith ) with the acs wide field channel ( wfc ) .",
    "a four - band ( f435w , f555w , f658n , and f814w ) image mosaic of m51a and ngc 5195 ( m51b ) was obtained in six acs pointings , with four dithered exposures at each pointing .",
    "these data had been previously analyzed by @xcite to determine the properties of the sn 2005cs progenitor .",
    "the `` drizzled '' mosaics in each band were taken from the hubble legacy archive ( hla ) .",
    "individual `` flt '' exposures were also acquired from the _ hst _ archive .",
    "the approximate location of the sn site was first established comparing the hla mosaics to early - time sn images , obtained with the katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at lick observatory .",
    "we subsequently ( 2011 june 6 ) took high - resolution , adaptive - optics ( ao ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath23-band ( central wavelength 2.124 @xmath24 m ; bandwidth 0.351 @xmath24 m ) images of the sn , using the near infrared camera 2 ( nirc2 ) instrument on the keck - ii 10-m telescope , to precisely pinpoint the sn location in the archival _ hst _ data . the geometric distortion corrections from @xcite were first applied to each of the individual nirc2 frames before combination of all frames into a single image mosaic . measuring the positions using _ imexamine _ in iraf of 18 stars seen in common between the keck ao and acs images , we were able to obtain an astrometric transformation with formal uncertainty ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) = ( 0.102 , 0.109 ) pixel , for a total root - mean square uncertainty of 0.149 acs pixel , or 7.45 milliarcsec ( mas ) , in the relative astrometry .",
    "the sn position , seen in figure  [ figprog]b , coincides with the point source visible in figure  [ figprog]a .",
    "comparison of the expected acs pixel position for the sn site , derived from the transformation , to the actual measured position of the source results in an uncertainty of 0.049 acs pixel = 2.5 mas , or @xmath6 19,000 au = 0.09 pc ( at the distance of m51 ) .",
    "accordingly , we have very high confidence in the probability that this object , the same as the one identified by @xcite , is spatially coincident with sn 2011dh .",
    "we analyzed the acs `` flt '' images in all bands using dolphot images ; @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite , which is especially designed for acs .",
    "we measured the relative offsets between the dithered exposures in each band , with respect to one fiducial image , before running the package .",
    "the output from dolphot automatically includes the transformation from flight - system f435w , f555w , and f814w to the corresponding johnson - cousins @xcite magnitudes in @xmath27 , following @xcite .",
    "since color corrections are required in the @xcite relations to transform the flight - system broad - band colors into the standard magnitude system , and no such color corrections exist for f658n , the flight - system magnitude in this narrow bandpass could not be transformed to a standard system .",
    "dolphot indicates with a flag , as well as with measurements of @xmath28 and the parameter `` sharpness , '' whether a detected source is most likely a _",
    "bona fide _ star .",
    "all of these indicators point to the detected object being stellar .",
    "the sn site was also imaged in a pair of 1300  s exposures with wfpc2 in f336w on 2005 november 13 ( go 10501 ; pi : chandar ) .",
    "we performed photometry of these images with hstphot .",
    "a source is detected at 4.1@xmath29 at the sn position in one of the two exposures , but not in the other one .",
    "the results of all of the photometry for the detected star are in table  [ photprog ] .",
    "to estimate the properties of this star , we need the m51 distance (   [ intro ] ) and the sn extinction . to infer the latter , we plot the star s photometry in a color - color diagram in figure  [ figcolor ] .",
    "we also show the colors from dolphot of stars in a @xmath30 pixel ( @xmath31 pc@xmath32 ) region centered around the sn site .",
    "furthermore , we show the locus for normal supergiants ( synthetic johnson - cousins colors extracted using the package stsdas / synphot within iraf from model supergiants ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the reddening vector from the @xcite reddening law . the detected star , as well as other stars in the immediate environment , appear to be subject to relatively low reddening .",
    "this agrees with the relative lack of dust emission at the sn site , as seen in pre - sn ( 2004 may 18 and 22 ) , archival _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ images of m51 at 8 @xmath24 m ( program i d 159 ; pi : kennicutt ) .",
    "this is also consistent with weak or undetectable nai  d absorption in a sn spectrum obtained on june 3 at the keck 10-m telescope using lris ( however , see * ? ? ?",
    "* regarding the limited utility of this absorption feature in low - resolution spectra to determine sn extinction ) , and via a comparison of early sn photometry , obtained using kait , with the dereddened colors of sn 2008ax ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the galactic contribution to the extinction is also relatively low , @xmath33 mag , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 mag @xcite .",
    "we adopt this foreground value as the extinction toward sn 2011dh .",
    "we also require the metallicity of the sn environment , which can be inferred from spectroscopy of hii regions nearest the sn site .",
    "the regions @xcite labelled `` 53 '' ( nearest region ) , `` 54 , '' and `` 55 '' have oxygen abundances 12 + log(o / h ) = @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "we assume these are representative of the sn environment .",
    "given that the solar value is 12 + log(o / h ) = @xmath39 @xcite and the average abundance for hii regions in the large magellanic cloud is 12 + log(o / h ) = @xmath40 @xcite , we conclude that the sn 2011dh site is most likely of roughly solar metallicity .",
    "we can estimate the effective temperature , @xmath41 , of the detected star by modeling its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) across all observed bands .",
    "we produced template seds via synthetic photometry , extracted using synphot , from @xcite model stars at solar metallicity with @xmath42 ( see below ) , reddened by our assumed value .",
    "we made the comparison in flight - system magnitudes , since the f658n measurement from dolphot and the f336w upper limit from hstphot could not be transformed to a standard system .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ figsed ] . the model with @xmath41 = 6000",
    "k compares well with the observations ( particularly those in the acs bands ) .",
    "we therefore adopt this temperature for the observed star , with a conservative uncertainty of @xmath43 k.    from the adopted distance modulus , extinction , and reddening , we find that the object had an absolute intrinsic magnitude of @xmath44 , and intrinsic colors @xmath45 and @xmath46 mag .",
    "we estimate that the probability is @xmath47 that a star more luminous than this in m51a could be found at this exact location . from the @xmath48 k model , above , we estimate that the bolometric correction for the detected star is @xmath49 mag , and therefore @xmath50 mag .",
    "the bolometric luminosity with respect to the sun ( assuming @xmath51 mag ) is @xmath52 .",
    "the star has a radius of @xmath53 , and we estimate its surface gravity to be @xmath54 ( assuming the star s mass is @xmath55 ; see below ) , so our choice for the model @xmath56 is warranted .",
    "we note that the star is significantly more extended than a normal supergiant at this temperature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is unlikely that the detected star is the one that actually exploded .",
    "as already noted , the early sn data indicate that the progenitor was far more compact ( radius @xmath0 cm ) .",
    "either the detected star is unrelated to the progenitor and is merely a very close ( @xmath57 pc ) neighbor , or , more likely , it is the companion to the progenitor in a binary system . the fact that hei lines were seen in the sn spectra within the first few weeks of explosion @xcite implies that the progenitor had been substantially stripped of its h envelope , presumably via a wind or mass exchange with its companion ( similar to sn 1993j ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the compact primary star would therefore be very hot , probably a star in a wolf - rayet ( wr ) phase . from figure",
    "[ figsed ] one can see that the presumed secondary star alone can account for much of what was marginally detected in the f336w bandpass .",
    "( additionally , nothing is detected at the sn position in archival _ galaxy evolution explorer _ [ _ galex _ ] ultraviolet nuv and fuv band data for m51 . ) a star with characteristics similar to a weak - lined , early - type , n - rich wr , with @xmath58 k , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 mag ( adopting the corresponding wne model from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , would be @xmath61 mag fainter in the f336w bandpass and would also be concealed by its brighter companion in all redder bands .",
    "this wr star , therefore , would have little effect on the total light of the system , although any wr more luminous than this would have been detected at f336w .    in figure  [ fighrd ]",
    "we show the loci of the detected secondary star and the hypothetical primary in a hertzsprung - russell diagram .",
    "( the main uncertainty in the luminosity of the detected star arises from the assumed distance modulus uncertainty , @xmath62 mag . )",
    "we also show model stellar evolutionary tracks for massive stars with equatorial rotation ( @xmath63 km s@xmath9 ; * ? ? ?",
    "these single - star tracks are meant to be merely _ suggestive _ of possible masses for the binary components ; in particular , these tracks do not even adequately account for the position of the hypothetical primary in the diagram .",
    "clearly , what is required is a full modeling of the components of this possible interacting binary system and its evolution up until the primary s explosion .",
    "we have detected in archival _ hst _ images a star at the precise location of sn 2011dh / ptf11eon .",
    "the star has colors consistent with mid - f - type , although its luminosity is higher ( @xmath64 mag ) and its radius more extended ( @xmath53 ) than is the case for a normal supergiant .",
    "the early properties of sn 2011dh , however , point to its having a compact progenitor ( * ? ? ?",
    "* radius @xmath65 cm , @xcite  @xcite ) , indicating that the detected star is likely not the star that exploded .",
    "( @xcite  @xcite favor the interpretation that the star is the yellow supergiant progenitor of the sn . )",
    "it is possible that the detected star is just a very close neighbor of , yet generally unrelated to , the actual progenitor .",
    "we consider it more likely , though , that the star is the companion to the progenitor in a binary system .",
    "the extended radius for the detected star and the compact radius for the progenitor implies that the two stars may have been interacting .",
    "we note , however , that no direct observational indication yet exists that the sn 2011dh progenitor was a member of a binary system .",
    "the compact sn 2011dh progenitor and the extended sn 1993j progenitor are within similar ranges of initial mass ( 1322 m@xmath4 for the latter ; * ? ? ?",
    "( note that @xcite @xcite concluded that , if the compact progenitor of sn 2008ax were also in a binary system , its initial mass range would have been significantly lower , 1014 m@xmath4 . ) we note that many of the model sn ib progenitors experiencing case a / case b mass transfer , which @xcite have recently considered , are also in a mass range similar to that suggested for the sn 2011dh progenitor . as both @xcite and @xcite point out",
    ", the difference between sn iib and ib progenitors could be razor thin , depending on the h mass remaining in the progenitor star s envelope .",
    "we will , of course , also develop a clearer picture once the sn has significantly faded , most likely several years in the future . at that time",
    ", imaging of the sn site can be undertaken , presumably with _",
    "hst _ , and we can determine if the possible secondary star is still there .",
    "for example , @xcite detected what they concluded to be the late - b- to late - f - type supergiant companion to the compact sn iib 2001ig in ground - based gemini images obtained @xmath66 d after explosion .",
    "if the star has vanished or significantly faded , we can investigate if any fainter stars were present , contributing to the observed point - spread function of the star detected in the pre - sn _ hst _ images .",
