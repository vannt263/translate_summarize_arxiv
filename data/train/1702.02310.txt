    "the investigations pertaining to the formation of baryons heavier than the nucleon at the core of neutron stars and the effects of such formation on the mass and radius of neutron stars is a subject of active research in nuclear astrophysics .",
    "it is expected that high density nuclear matter may consist not only of nucleons and leptons but also several exotic components such as hyperons , mesons as well as quark matter in different forms and phases .",
    "while many studies have been conducted to address the appearance of hyperons and on the so called _ hyperon puzzle _ @xcite , little work has been done to study the appearance of @xmath0 @xmath4 isobars in neutron stars .",
    "an earlier work @xcite indicated the appearance of @xmath0 at much higher densities than the typical densities of the core of neutron stars and hence was considered of little significance to astrophysical studies .",
    "however , recent studies @xcite suggest the possibility of an early appearance of @xmath0 isobars with consequent softening of the equation of state ( eos ) of dense matter .",
    "this leads to a reduction in the maximum mass of neutron stars below the current observational limit of @xmath5  m@xmath6 @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we would like to address the @xmath0-puzzle in a modified quark - meson coupling model ( mqmc ) @xcite which has already been adopted successfully studying various bulk properties of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the mqmc model is based on a confining relativistic independent quark potential model rather than a bag to describe the baryon structure in vacuum .",
    "the baryon - baryon interactions are realized by making additional quark couplings to @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 mesons through mean - field approximations . more recently @xcite it was extended to study the eos of nuclear matter with the inclusion of hyperons as new degrees of freedom and the effect of a non - linear @xmath2-@xmath3 term keeping in view the constraints of the mass of the precisely measured massive pulsars , psr j0348 + 0432 and psr j1614 - 2230 .    here",

    "the nucleon - nucleon interaction is well known from nuclear properties .",
    "but the extrapolation of such interactions to densities beyond nuclear saturation density is quite challenging .",

    ". theoretical studies of gamow - teller transitions and m1 giant resonance in nuclei by bohr and mottelson @xcite observed a @xmath18% reduction in transition strength due to the couplings to @xmath0 isobars , indicating weaker coupling of the isoscalar mesons to the @xmath0 isobars .",

    "<S> the hadron - hadron interaction in nuclear matter is then realized by introducing additional quark couplings to @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 mesons through mean - field approximations . the couplings of the @xmath0 to the meson fields are fixed from available constraints while the hyperon couplings are fixed from the optical potential values . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that within the constraints of the mass of the precisely measured massive pulsars , psr j0348 + 0432 and psr j1614 - 2230 , neutron stars with a composition of both @xmath0 isobars and hyperons is possible . </S>",
    "<S> it is also observed that with an increase in the vector coupling strength of the @xmath0 isobars there is a decrease in the radius of the neutron stars . </S>"
