    "the recent discovery of the transiting extrasolar planetary system wasp-18 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter h09 ) lights the way towards understanding the tidal interactions between giant planets and their parent stars .",
    "wasp-18b is one of the shortest - period ( @xmath5d ) and most massive ( @xmath6@xmath1 ) extrasolar planets known .",
    "these properties make it an unparallelled indicator of the tidal dissipation parameters @xcite for the star and the planet @xcite . a value similar to that observed for solar system bodies ( @xmath7@xmath8 ; @xcite ) would cause the orbital period of wasp-18 to decrease at a sufficient rate for the effect to be observable within ten years ( h09 ) .",
    "in this work we present high - precision follow - up photometry of wasp-18 , obtained using telescope - defocussing techniques @xcite which give a scatter of only 0.47 to 0.83 mmag per observation .",
    "these are analysed to yield improved physical properties of the wasp-18 system , with careful attention paid to statistical and systematic errors .",
    "the quality of the light curve is a critical factor in measurement of the physical properties of transiting planets @xcite . in the case of",
    "wasp-18 the systematic errors arising from the use of theoretical stellar models are also important , and are a limiting factor in the understanding of this system .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the physical properties of a transiting planetary system can not in general be calculated purely from observed quantities . the most common way to overcome",
    "this difficulty is to impose predictions from theoretical stellar evolutionary models onto the parent star .",
    "we have used tabulated predictions from three sources : _ claret _",
    "@xcite and _ cambridge _ @xcite .",
    "this allows the assessment of the systematic errors caused by using stellar theory .",
    "we began with the parameters measured from the light curve and the observed velocity amplitude of the parent star , @xmath10ms@xmath11 ( h09 ) .",
    "these were augmented by an estimate of the velocity amplitude of the _ planet _ , @xmath12 , to calculate preliminary physical properties of the system .",
    "we then interpolated within one of the grids of theoretical predictions to find the expected radius and @xmath13  of the star for the preliminary mass and the measured metal abundance ( @xmath14}}= 0.00 \\pm 0.09 $ ] ; h09 ) .",
    "@xmath12 was then iteratively refined to minimise the difference between the model - predicted radius and @xmath13 , and the calculated radius and measured @xmath13  ( @xmath15k ; h09 ) .",
    "this was done for a range of ages for the star , and the best overall fit retained as the optimal solution .",
    "finally , the above process was repeated whilst varying every input parameter by its uncertainty to build up a complete error budget for each output parameter @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of this process can be found in @xcite .",
    "table[tab : absdimall ] shows the results of these analyses .",
    "the physical properties calculated using the _ claret _ and _ y@xmath9 _ sets of stellar models are in excellent agreement , but those from the _ cambridge _ models are slightly discrepant .",
    "this causes systematic errors of 4% in the stellar mass and 2% in the planetary mass , both of similar size to the corresponding statistical errors .",
    "the quality of our results is therefore limited by our theoretical understanding of the parent star .",
    "our final results are in good agreement with those of h09 ( table[tab : absdimall ] ) , but incorporate a more comprehensive set of uncertainties .",
    "these results give the equilibrium temperature of the planet to be one of the highest for the known planets : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the bond albedo and @xmath18 is the heat redistribution factor . this equilibrium temperature , and the closeness to its parent star , make wasp-18b a good target for the detection of thermal emission and reflected light .",
    "we have presented high - quality observations of five consecutive transits by the newly - discovered planet wasp-18b , which has one of the shortest orbital periods of all known transiting extrasolar planetary systems ( teps ) .",
    "our defocussed - photometry approach yielded scatters of between 0.47 and 0.83 mmag per point in the final light curves .",
    "these data were analysed using the jktebop code , which was modified to include the spectroscopically derived orbital eccentricity in a statistically correct way .",
    "the light curve parameters were then combined with the predictions of theoretical stellar evolutionary models to determine the physical properties of the planet and its host star .",
    "a significant source of uncertainty in our results stems from the use of theoretical models to constrain the physical properties of the star .",
    "further uncertainty comes from observed @xmath13  and @xmath19 $ ] , for which improved values are warranted .",
    "however , the systematic error from the use of stellar theory is an important uncertainty in the masses of the star and planet .",
    "this is due to our fundamentally incomplete understanding of the structure and evolution of low - mass stars . as with many other transiting systems ( e.g.  wasp-4 ;",
    "@xcite ) , our understanding of the planet is limited by our lack of understanding of the parent star .",
    "we confirm and refine the physical properties of wasp18 found by h09 .",
    "wasp-18b is a very massive planet in an extremely short - period and _ eccentric _ orbit , which is a clear indicator that the tidal effects in planetary systems are weaker than expected ( see h09 ) .",
    "long - term follow - up studies of wasp-18 will add progressively stricter constraints on the orbital decay of the planet and thus the strength of these tidal effects .",
    "we now split the full sample of known ( i.e.  published ) teps into two classes according to planetary mass .",
    "the mass distribution of transiting planets shows a dearth of objects with masses in the interval 2.03.1@xmath1 .",
    "there are nine planets more massive than this and 46 less massive .",
    "seven of the nine high - mass teps have eccentric orbits ( hat - p-2 , @xcite ; hd17156 , @xcite ; hd80606 , @xcite ; wasp-10 , @xcite ; wasp-14 , @xcite ; wasp-18 ; xo-3 , @xcite ) , and the existing radial velocity observations of the remaining two can not rule out an eccentricity of @xmath20 or lower ( corot - exo-2 , @xcite ; ogle - tr - l9 , @xcite ) . by comparison ,",
    "only four of the 46 low - mass teps have a _ significant _ @xcite orbital eccentricity measurement .",
    "these numbers imply that the more massive teps are a different population to the less massive ones ; fisher s exact test @xcite returns a probability lower than @xmath21 of the null hypothesis ( although this does not account for our freedom to choose the dividing line between the two classes ) .",
    "this indicates that the two types of teps have a different internal structure , formation mechanism , or evolution , a suggestion which is supported by observations of misalignment between the spin and orbital axes of @xmath22@xmath1  teps @xcite .",
    "there is , however , a bias at work here .",
    "the more massive teps cause a larger radial velocity signal in their parent star ( @xmath23 ) , so a given set of radial velocity measurements can detect smaller eccentricities ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the eccentricity of the wasp-18 system is in fact below the detection limit of existing observations of most teps .",
    "we therefore advocate the acquisition of additional velocity data for the known low - mass teps , in order to equalise the eccentricity detection limits between the two classes of teps .",
    "these observations would allow acceptance or rejection of the hypothesis that more massive teps represent a fundamentally different planet population to their lower - mass brethren .",
    "the observations presented in this work will be made available at the cds ( http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/ ) and at http://www.astro.keele.ac.uk/@xmath24jkt/. the operation of the danish 1.54 m telescope was financed by the danish natural science research council ( fnu ) .",
