    "the high energy @xmath0-ray observations open a new window not only for the astronmy , but also for the particle physics , cosmology , which must bring us critical information and hints for the understanding of current questions such as nature of the dark matter , mechanism of the @xmath0-ray burst , origin of the highest cosmic - ray ( cr ) , and so forth . in recent years ,",
    "remarkably developed are techniques in both on - board and ground - based telescopes , _ fermi _ , h.e.s.s . ,",
    "magic , veritas , which have reported exciting results for the sky - map of gev - tev @xmath0-rays in space , still working continuously , see @xcite for review .",
    "a new program called cta ( cherenkov telescope array ) is further progressing in the form of the international collaboration consisting of many scientists from europe , usa and japan @xcite .",
    "it covers very wide energy range of @xmath0-rays with several tens gev to more than 10 tev with much higher sensitivity than ever achieved , the full operation of which is scheduled around 2020 . if the cta program is operated as scheduled , we expect to detect tev @xmath0-ray sources more than thousands , comparable with those currently observed in gev region , which must bring us surely new aspects for the understanding of the universe .    under these situations , it is quite desireable to have a reliable production cross - section of hadron - induced @xmath0-rays with tev energy or more , while those of electron - induced ones are , needless to say , well established on the basis of qed .",
    "stecker @xcite presented the production cross - section of @xmath12 , @xmath13 with @xmath14@xmath15100gev ( @xmath10@xmath151tev ) in the form of very useful parameterizations in 1973 , and later one of the authors ( t.  s. ) revised it in the previous paper @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) , applicable for the higher energy region @xmath10@xmath41tev .",
    "nevertheless , the reliability is not always satisfactory , particularly in the forward region for @xmath16@xmath41tev ( @xmath10@xmath410tev ) because of the limitation in the accelerator data , having no data on the energy spectra in the forward region , while chacaltaya emulsion chamber ( ec ) group [ 20 , 33 ] have given them using cr - beams , but poor in data quality .",
    "fortunatelly , the lhc experiment started the operations in early 2010 , among which the lhcf group measured @xmath0-ray spectra in the very forward region with the pseudo - rapidity @xmath17 in the cms @xcite .",
    "the principal purpose of the lhcf is to find the best simulation code in hadron - interaction models , which plays a key role in the study of the extensive air shower ( eas ) phenomena induced by the ultra - high energy crs , affecting directly the estimation of the primary cr energy as well as its composition .",
    "while none of models currently available reproduce satisfactorily the lhcf data according to their preliminary studies @xcite , they will report a revised model soon based on further analyses as well as on coming data at @xmath18tev , the run of which is scheduled in 2014 .",
    "alternatively , the lhcf data also give us crucial information for the study of hadron - induced @xmath0-rays in galactic environments , both interstellar medium ( ism ) and the source of crs , typically the supernova remnant ( snr ) .",
    "particularly interesting is the production cross - section of @xmath0-rays with 100tev or more in the laboratory system ( ls ) , corresponding to the knee energy around pev .",
    "we expect that the knee problem in close connection with the acceleration limit of crs in the snr may be solved by the cta program through the observations of ultra - high energy @xmath0-rays with @xmath16 @xmath4 100tev , possibly much more clearly than those of hadronic components",
    ". note that it is still not cleared albeit so many years have passed since the discovery of the knee @xcite .",
    "this is mainly due to the difficulty in observing the latter components around the knee energy by both direct ( balloon and/or satellite ) and the indirect ( eas ) methods , which have inevitable weaknesses in statistics for the former , and in the uncertainty of the composition for the latter .    now",
    "the accelerator data on @xmath2 being available over extremely wide energy ranges , @xmath19gev@xmath20 30pev , it is an easy task to find empirically the cross - section by _ interpolating _ them without asking for complicated models in the meson production .",
    "while many phenomenological models with qcd have been applied for the current simulation codes @xcite , one should keep in mind the fact that even the inelastic collision cross - section based on qcd , @xmath21 , is not yet definitely established , and much less successful are those for the multiple meson production , @xmath22 . in the present paper , we give @xmath2 with simple parameterization based on the experimental data with lhc , revising slightly the previous one , which will be quite useful for the study of future @xmath0-ray astronomy even around 100 tev or more .",
    "in paper i , we gave the empirical formula for the inelastic cross - section , @xmath23 , in p - p collision which covers the wide energy range from the threshold energy of pion production ( @xmath24 ) to the fnal energy ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "now we have the lhc data ( atlas[5 ] , alice[23 ] , totem[24 ] ) on @xmath26 at @xmath27 .",
    "the lhc energy currently available corresponds to approximately 26pev proton in the ls , hign enough even for 100tev @xmath0-ray astronomy .",
    "based on the lhc data , we assume a following empirical form for @xmath26 ,    @xmath28{s / s_0}\\,\\bigr],\\ ] ]    with @xmath29 where @xmath10 and @xmath30 are the kinetic energy and velocity of the projectile proton in ls respectively , @xmath31gev , and see the first column ( @xmath32 ) of table 1 for @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . practically , @xmath36 for @xmath37gev .",
    "[ cols=\">,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in figs .",
    "6 - 15 , we present explicitly the numerical sets of @xmath38 $ ] in the extremely wide energy ranges , @xmath10 = 1gev @xmath20 26pev , which are summarized all together in table 3 .    for the @xmath0-ray astronomy , practically the most essential is the _ total _ production cross - section of @xmath0-rays , @xmath39 , no matter how the emission - angle @xmath40 ( or the transverse momentum @xmath41 ) appears in the functional form of the cross - section .",
    "after stecker @xcite summarized it in 1973 , we revised it in paper i with the data covering tev region but without lhc data .",
    "let us present @xmath42 against @xmath10 in fig",
    ".  16 with lhc data , using eq .",
    "( 1 ) for @xmath43 , where we give a solid curve obtained by the following empirical form for @xmath44 , + @xmath45 ,   \\eqno{\\rm ( 25a)}\\ ] ] @xmath46{\\hat{e_0}}\\,\\bigr)\\biggr ] ,   \\eqno{\\rm ( 25b)}\\ ] ] with @xmath47 in gev , and presented together is a dashed curve from the previous parametrization @xcite for @xmath48 .",
    "we plot also @xmath42 ( open circles ) expected from the pseudo - rapidity distribution of charged hadrons , assuming @xmath49 ( see figs .  13 and 15 ) .",
    "one finds that the previous one gives significantly over - estimation in pev region , and the present one reproduces nicely the experimental points in the very wide energy range , @xmath10 = 1gev @xmath20 26pev .    in fig .",
    "17 , we give the average transverse momentum , @xmath50 , against @xmath10 , together with the empirical curve given by @xmath51{\\hat{e_0}}\\,\\bigr)\\biggr ] , \\eqno{(26)}\\ ] ] with @xmath52 while it is of little interest for the @xmath0-ray astronomy , but important for the study of shower phenomena in the atmosphere . in fig .",
    "17 we plot also the half of the transverse momentum of the charged pions [ 37 ] , assuming @xmath50(@xmath0 ) @xmath53 @xmath50(@xmath54)/2 .",
    "one finds that @xmath50 increases slowly with @xmath10 , as given by eq .",
    "in the present paper , interpolating experimental data nowadays covering the very wide energy range from gev to 30pev , we have focussed our work on the construction of the semi - empirical formula for the inclusive production cross - section of @xmath0-rays , @xmath55 , without asking for the cumbersome qcd - based models , and find that it reproduces excellently the machine data over the very wide energy ranges .",
    "the present simple parameterization in the formula should be compared to the simulation codes currently available in the cr community , which are usually very complicated , patching different models separately in low and high energy regions , and _ heavy _ in the sense that they are constructed so that all the components ( @xmath56 ) in both soft ( small @xmath57 ) and hard ( large @xmath57 ) processes simultaneously match with the accelerator data .",
    "so it is not an easy task for physicists other than a developer of simulation code to improve it freely , by contrast with the empirical formula , quite easy to touch the parameters appearing there . of course one",
    "should keep in mind that our approach ( interpolation method ) is not valid for the study of extremely high energy shower phenomena in the atmosphere , say @xmath4 10@xmath58ev , where even the lhc can not cover , resulting in the need of some theoretical models in order to extrapolate the lhc data much higher , while the present parameterization is valid enough for the future @xmath0-ray astronomy , even up to pev-@xmath0 observation .",
    "we have concentrated our interest upon two parameters , @xmath44 and @xmath50 , particularly on the former . as mentioned often , the multiplicity @xmath44 plays an essential role for the study of @xmath0-ray astronomy , appearing always in the form of the total production cross - section , @xmath59 as presented in fig .",
    "alternatively , @xmath44 is important also for the study of the shower phenomena in the atmosphere , appearing in the ( total ) inelasticity @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "so let us present @xmath7 ( see eq .",
    "[ 18 ] ) transferred to @xmath0-rays against @xmath10 in fig .",
    "18 , where also plotted are those ( filled squares ) expected from charged hadrons ( see figs .  13 and 15 ) , assuming @xmath62 @xmath53 @xmath63/2 .",
    "an error - bar attached to each square comes from statistical ones to @xmath44 as presented in fig .",
    "one finds approximately @xmath62 @xmath53 1/6 as a whole , almost independent of @xmath10 , while it is as small as 0.1 - 0.17 in the low energy region @xmath10",
    "@xmath15 1tev , and as large as 0.15 - 0.2 in the high energy region @xmath4 10tev , indicating a small increase as the energy gets higher .",
    "but we reserve the conclusion for future studies , either constant or the increase .",
    "+ it has been well - known that the attenuation length @xmath64 for the intensity of cr hadronic components in the atmosphere is given by @xmath65 @xcite , where @xmath66 is the collision length , and @xmath67 the index of the integral primary cr spectrum with @xmath201.8 .",
    "experimentally we have @xmath68 , with for instance @xmath69g/@xmath70 and @xmath71g/@xmath70 @xcite , leading to @xmath60 @xmath53 1/2 in the energy region @xmath10",
    "@xmath15 100tev , assuming the uniform distribution in @xmath72 , while not yet clear in the air shower region @xmath10",
    "@xmath4 10pev .",
    "anyway the present result is not inconsistent with the common understanding in the inelasticity expected from the attenuation of crs in the atmosphere .",
    "finally we address further two open problems in the present paper ; ( 1 ) the nucleus effect of proton - nucleus ( p - a ) and/or nucleus - nucleus ( a - a ) collisions for the production cross - section of @xmath0-rays in p - p collisions , and ( 2 ) the applicability of the present empirical cross - section for the galactic phenomena other than emissions of the hadron - induced @xmath0-rays , particularly for those of the electron - positrons coming from @xmath54@xmath73@xmath74@xmath73@xmath75 decays .",
    "first , for the problem ( 1 ) , one should remember that the effective @xmath0-rays produced by the nuclear interaction in the galactic environments ( either in ism or in snr ) are only those produced in the forward region in the cms , while not important are those in the central and backward regions .",
    "the effect of the plural interactions inside the nucleus appears only in the latter regions .",
    "in fact , it has been experimentally well - known that the difference between those produced by p - p and those by p - a ( a - a ) collisions appears only in the latter regions , while they are well in coincidence with each other in the forward region .",
    "this is the reason why we present fig . 5 , stressing in the present paper how essential are the @xmath0-rays produced in the forward region , in contrast not important in the central region , and of much less importance in the backward .",
    "practically , of course , we need the production cross - section of @xmath0-rays for p - a ( a - a ) collisions , as there exist additionally helium and heavier components in crs ( projectiles ) as well as the helium gas in the ism ( targets ) , while unfortunately we have not yet a reliable model nowadays for the p - a ( a - a ) collisions . we have used the modified wounded - nucleon model of gaisser and schafer [ 34 ] in our past calculations [ 26 , 27 ] , where we mention that the uncertainty in the nucleus effect is of the second order for the practice . in order to see the uncertainty , we have introduced so called the @xmath76enhancement factor \" defined by @xmath77 , taking the energy dependence into account , where @xmath78 is the emissivity of @xmath0-rays in the galaxy produced by all kinds of nuclear interactions with p - p , p - a and a - a , and @xmath79 by those with p - p only . for instance , @xmath80=1.54(gaisser - shafer [ 34 ] ) , 1.50(cavallo - gould [ 35 ] ) , 1.60(stephens - badhwar [ 36 ] ) , and 1.53(shibata et al .  [ 26 ] ) , indicating that the difference in the choice of nucleus interaction model is not so significant as compared to that in the choice of the propagation model .",
    "these results tell us also that the procedure in the calculation of the cr propagation becomes quite simple by the use of the enhancement factor @xmath80 .",
    "second , for the problem ( 2 ) , indeed we do not touch the intermediate meson , @xmath12 , except the pseudo - rapidity distribution of charged hadrons ( figs .  13 and 15 ) , but",
    "the decay products @xmath0 s only , having no interest in the intermediate mesons , either via @xmath12 or via heavier @xmath81 , etc .. however , as long as focussing on the decay products such as electrons and/or neutrinos from muons , the present empirical form for @xmath0 s , @xmath55 , is valid also for muons produced via pions , @xmath82 , while we have to take care of the mass difference between photon and the muon .",
    "this is because both decays , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , are isotropic two - body decays in the pion rest system , leading to the same kinematics in @xmath0 and @xmath85 but different mass .",
    "namely , we do not need the information of the intermediate pions also in the case of the muon production cross - section .",
    "this fact tells us that we have model - independently a kinematical relation between the emissivity of @xmath0-rays and that of ( secondary ) electron - positrons in the galaxy , detail of which will be reported elsewhere in connection with the galactic electron - positron spectrum .    in the near future",
    ", we will apply the present cross - section , @xmath55 , for the observational data in tev region currently available on both diffused @xmath0-rays and those from the source , while one of the authors ( t.  s. ) have studied the former components in _ fermi _ energy region , 100mev @xmath20 100gev @xcite , @xcite , using the old parameterization in @xmath55 .",
    "we thank t. sako ( nogoya university ) for giving us valuable information and comments on lhcf experiments .",
    "we are also grateful to cta - japan member for valuable discussions in the internal meetings .",
    "the kinematical relation between @xmath0 and @xmath12 energy - distributions was studied by sternheimer @xcite , where he assumed that the opening angle , @xmath86 , of two @xmath0 s from the decay of high energy @xmath12 is so small that the emission angle of @xmath0 is approximately equal to that of @xmath12 , @xmath87 . but this approximation seems to be too rough to transform practically from the pseudo - rapidity distribution of @xmath0 s to that of @xmath12 s , namely @xmath88 in his approximation . in this appendix we present a more realistic relation between them .",
    "let us consider a @xmath12 produced by p - p collision with @xmath89 , each denoting the energy , emission angle , and the azimuthal angle in the cms respectively , and disintegrate into two @xmath0 s with @xmath90 and @xmath91 , where individual angles are those against the collision axis .",
    "we define further two sets of angles , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , which are the emission angles and the zenith angles of two @xmath0 s against the _ moving direction _ of @xmath12 . in this appendix",
    "we put @xmath94 for the sake of simplicity .      integrating over @xmath99 for both sides of eq .",
    "( a2 ) , we have @xmath100 and hereafter we omit angle brackets , @xmath101 , in the left - hand side for the simplicity , as we are not interested in the azimuthal component .    remembering a well - known relation in @xmath12-decay @xcite @xmath102 for @xmath103",
    ", we obtain , from eqs .",
    "( a1a)-(a1c ) , @xmath104 namely @xmath105 with @xmath106 now we have from eq .",
    "( a3 ) , putting @xmath107 and @xmath108 , @xmath109    here we have to take care of the above expansion with respect to @xmath110 , which is based on the approximation with @xmath111 , while sternheimer assumed @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "this means the energy range of @xmath0 is limitted within ( @xmath113 ) for the fixed energy of @xmath12 , @xmath114 , which are obtained from eq .",
    "( a4 ) with @xmath115 , and given by @xmath116e_{\\pi^0}^*/2 , \\eqno{\\rm ( a6)}\\ ] ] with @xmath117    now , we define the energy - angular distribution function of @xmath12 with @xmath118 @xmath119 and thus the energy - angular distribution function of @xmath0 is given by , putting @xmath120 , @xmath121 n_{\\pi^0}(e_{\\pi^0}^ * , t_{\\pi^0}^ * ) , \\eqno{\\rm ( a8)}\\ ] ] and @xmath122 is the maximum energy of @xmath123 given by eq .",
    "( 6 ) in the text .    for @xmath103 ( equivalently @xmath124 )",
    ", we have with use of eq.(a5 ) @xmath125 and integrating over @xmath126 for both sides of eq .",
    "( a8 ) in order to obtain the angular distribution , we obtain @xmath127 where one has to take care of the kinematical constraints in @xmath128 given by eqs .  ( a6 ) and ( a7 ) for the practical integrations .",
    "now we use the approximation given by sternheimer for @xmath129 appearing in the integrand in eq .",
    "( a9 ) , @xmath130 note that the second iteration for @xmath129 is negligible as shown in fig .",
    "19 , and next exchange the order of integrations for @xmath131 and @xmath114 , taking care of the kinematical constraints mentioned before @xmath132 with @xmath133 the second term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( a9 ) is thus given by @xmath134 with @xmath135    assuming @xmath136 , and substituting the explicit form of @xmath137 ) given by eq.(11 ) into eq.(a10 ) with @xmath138 , finally we obtain the kinematical relation between @xmath0 and @xmath123 pseudo - rapidity distributions @xmath139 \\frac{dn_{\\gamma}}{d\\eta^ * } , \\eqno{\\rm ( a11)}\\ ] ] with @xmath140 @xmath141    see eq .",
    "( 19 ) for @xmath142 . in fig .",
    "( 19 ) , we present the numerical value of the correction rate for the sternheimer approximation with @xmath112 , corresponding to the second term in the square bracket in eq.(a11 ) , where we assume @xmath143mev / c , corresponding to approximately @xmath144=185 , 189 , 191 , 193mev / c for @xmath145=0.1 , 0.2 , 0.5 , 1.0tev respectivey . we find that it is as large as 7% around @xmath146 at @xmath147tev",
