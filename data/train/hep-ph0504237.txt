    "the sno @xcite and kamland @xcite experiments have played a crucial role in resolving the longstanding solar neutrino problem in terms of large mixing angle ( lma ) msw oscillations and are expected to play an important role in the refinement of the lma solution which is undergoing a deeper scrutiny .",
    "does the lma solution explain all the solar neutrino data satisfactorily ?",
    "there are , at least , two generic predictions of lma indicating new physics beyond lma .",
    "one of these is the prediction of the high argon production rate for homestake experiment which is about 2@xmath0 above the observed rate .",
    "another generic prediction of the lma scenario is the ` spectral upturn ' at low energies . within the lma parameter space ,",
    "the survival probability should increase with decrease in energy and for the best fit parameters , the upturn could be as large as 10 - 15% between 8 mev and 5 mev @xcite .",
    "in fact , the spectral upturn at low energies is expected to increase further with the kamland 766.3 ty spectral data @xcite favoring a larger value of @xmath1 @xcite . however , neither superkamiokande nor sno has reported any statistically significant ` rise - up ' in the observed neutrino survival probability .",
    "both these predictions of the lma solution can , only , be tested in the forthcoming phase of high precision measurements @xcite in the solar neutrino experiments and are crucial for the final confirmation of the lma solution .",
    "another unresolved issue is whether the solar neutrinos oscillate into the sterile component .",
    "the main motivation for postulating the existence of the sterile neutrino species comes from the lsnd experiment which reported a significant @xmath2 oscillation probability @xcite which requires a new mass scale .",
    "since , the z - decay width constrains the number of weakly interacting light neutrino species to be very close to three @xcite , one is forced to postulate a sterile neutrino . while the purely sterile oscillation solution is excluded at 7.6@xmath0 @xcite",
    ", the solar electron neutrinos could still oscillate into both active and sterile neutrinos , a scenario which is , largely , unconstrained at present .",
    "in fact , a combined analysis @xcite of solar and atmospheric neutrino data has shown that the active - sterile admixture can take any value between zero and one .",
    "while the sno charged current data excluded the maximal mixing to sterile neutrinos at 5.4@xmath0 @xcite , arbitrary active - sterile admixtures were not considered .",
    "consequently , a significant sterile fraction in the solar neutrino flux reaching the earth is , still , possible .",
    "the discovery of the sterile neutrinos would be of great importance for particle physics , even though , it is , still , not clear how these hypothetical ` exotic ' degrees of freedom would fit into elementary particle theory .",
    "the possibility of subdominant transitions into sterile neutrino states accompanying the dominant lma flavor transitions has been examined earlier @xcite and upper bounds on the sterile neutrino fraction in the non - electronic boron neutrino flux have been derived .",
    "however , the subdominant transitions into sterile states have neither been confirmed nor ruled out at a statistically significant level . in the present work",
    ", the possibility of flavor transitions into sterile component in the solar boron neutrino flux has been examined in a model presented by hollanda and smirnov @xcite to lower the abnormally high argon production rate in the homestake experiment and , also , to lower the ` spectral upturn ' in the low energy boron neutrino spectrum predicted in the pure lma scenario .",
    "we introduce a sterile neutrino @xmath3 which mixes weakly with the active flavors @xmath4 and @xmath5 to form the mass eigenstates @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 given by @xmath9 with masses @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath13 ( weak mixing ) so that @xmath3 is mainly present in the mass eigenstate @xmath6 only .",
    "following hollanda and smirnov @xcite , we assume the mass hierarchy @xmath14 , and define the following mass squared differences : @xmath15 the energy eigenlevels for the above neutrino system ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) are denoted by @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively . for the mass hierarchy assumed above , the level @xmath16 crosses the level @xmath17 only and @xmath19 is , approximately , the same as it would be in the pure lma two flavor scenario in the absence of any sterile mixing .",
    "neglecting the small admixture of @xmath20 in @xmath6 , one obtains @xmath21 where , @xmath22 , given by @xmath23 is the survival probability for electron neutrinos in the pure lma scenario .",
    "@xmath24 is the crossing probability at the point where @xmath16 and @xmath17 cross while @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the mixing angles in the matter .",
    "the symbols @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 have their usual meaning .",
    "hollanda and smirnov @xcite have shown that the introduction of sterile admixture leads to a decrease in the ` rise - up ' in the boron neutrino spectrum at lower energies and , also , reduces the argon production rate at homestake to a phenomenological acceptable level for @xmath30 apart from some rather ` exotic ' scenarios proposed in literature @xcite , it happens to be the simplest and the most plausible scenario to overcome the generic problems of the pure lma solution mentioned earlier .",
    "therefore , it is important to constrain the sterile component in this scenario ( referred to as the ( lma+sterile ) scenario , henceforth ) in the light of the sno solar neutrino data .    in this ( lma+ sterile ) scenario , @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the fluxes measured at sno through cc and nc reactions , respectively , and @xmath36 is the total boron neutrino flux .    from equations ( 8 - 10 ) , one obtains @xmath37 and @xmath38 where @xmath39 the ratio of nonelectronic active neutrino flux to total nonelectronic ( active+sterile ) neutrino flux , denoted by @xmath40 , is given by @xmath41 in the lma scenario @xmath42 where @xmath43 is given by equation ( 13 ) .",
    "however , in the ( lma + sterile ) scenario , @xmath36 and @xmath44 are not equal and one has to use the relation @xmath45@xmath31 instead , where @xmath36 is , now , an independent quantity which can not be determined from the sno cc and nc fluxes .",
    "one can use the boron neutrino flux given by the standard solar model ( ssm ) for @xmath36 to calculate @xmath46 and @xmath27 .",
    "however , because of large errors in the ssm boron neutrino flux ( @xmath47 ) , only a lower bound on @xmath46 can be obtained while the upper bound becomes larger than unity @xcite .    without assuming @xmath27",
    ", one can not calculate @xmath46 and @xmath48 , uniquely and only a family of solutions corresponding to different values of @xmath27 is obtained .",
    "equations ( 8) and ( 14 ) can be rewritten as a set of coupled equations as follows : @xmath49 and @xmath50 this degeneracy is well known as the ( @xmath51 ) degeneracy in the literature @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath36 is , usually , given in the units of the central value of @xmath47 , so that @xmath52 ) .    to gain further insight into this degeneracy ,",
    "we rewrite equations ( 11,12 ) as follows @xmath53 and @xmath54 since , we have only two equations relating three unknowns viz .",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , a unique solution is not possible and one obtains a family of solutions , instead , corresponding to different values of @xmath55 balentekin et al .",
    "@xcite identify @xmath27 with @xmath22 ( electron neutrino survival probability in the pure lma scenario in the absence of any sterile transitions ) and use equations ( 8) , ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) to constrain the sterile component . however , equation ( 15 ) can not be used to derive meaningful constraints on the sterile component since one obtains @xmath56on substitution of equation ( 15 ) in equation ( 16 ) . to overcome this problem , we use equation ( 3 ) alongwith equations ( 18,19 ) to constrain the sterile component .",
    "we collect all these equations below :    @xmath57    this set of coupled equations has the following simultaneous solution @xmath58",
    "in order to examine the possibility of transitions into sterile neutrinos , we plot the @xmath59 allowed upper and lower values of @xmath60 [ equation ( 8) ] allowed by the salt phase sno data @xcite and bp04 @xcite in figure 1 which , also , depicts @xmath27 as a function of @xmath29 as given by equation ( 12 ) .",
    "it is clear from figure 1 that significant transitions into sterile neutrinos are allowed by the sno salt phase data and , in fact , the @xmath59 upper bound on @xmath29 could be as large as 0.4 .",
    "more precise bounds on the sterile fraction in the boron neutrino flux can , only , be obtained with more precise measurements of cc and nc rates at sno in the future .",
    "it may be pertinent to mention here that the boron neutrino flux estimates in the ssm have , rather , large uncertainties .",
    "consequently , considerable improvements in the boron neutrino flux estimates in the ssm are required for obtaining meaningful constraints on the possible sterile neutrino fraction in the boron neutrino flux .",
    "one can obtain the electron neutrino survival probability @xmath27 , the transition probability into muon neutrinos @xmath28 and the transition probability into the sterile neutrinos @xmath29 from equations ( 21 - 23 ) by substituting the flux - averaged value of @xmath22 ( calculated for the values of @xmath1 and @xmath61 and @xmath59 errors therein taken from @xcite ) and the value of @xmath43 reported by sno @xcite .",
    "it is important to realize here that the sno cc flux is the actual electron neutrino flux @xmath62  if the boron energy spectrum is assumed to be undistorted . since , the superkamiokande @xcite ( with a better precision ) has not reported any , statistically significant , spectral distortions in the boron neutrino spectrum , we assume an undistorted boron neutrino spectrum and identify @xmath22 with @xmath43 at the high energy end .",
    "however , since the lma scenario predicts a significant spectral upturn at lower energies @xcite , @xmath22 is expected to be , significantly , different from @xmath43 at lower energies . for the flux averaged value of @xmath22 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which is non - zero at about @xmath66 .",
    "the probabilities @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 have been plotted in figure 2 as functions of @xmath43 where the @xmath59 upper and lower bounds have , also , been shown .",
    "it is clear from figure 2 that the @xmath59 values of @xmath27 and @xmath29 are of comparable magnitude .",
    "in fact , for the smaller values of x , the transition probability into the sterile neutrinos can , even , be larger than the electron neutrino survival probability .",
    "it is , also , clear from figure 2 , that the errors in the value of x are the most significant sources of error in the values of the probabilities and once the value of x is settled by the experiments , the errors in the probabilities will become much smaller .",
    "for example , for a most conservative choice of @xmath67 , the transition probability into the sterile neutrinos is found to be @xmath68 which is non - zero at @xmath69 if the value of x is settled below this value ( i.e. @xmath70 , as is most likely ) by the experiments , the transition probability into the sterile neutrinos as well as the corresponding confidence level will be larger than the above values ( at @xmath67 ) . thus , the main source of error in the transition probability into the sterile neutrinos being the uncertainty in the value of x , a more precise determination of the value of x ( below the value 0.341 ) will give a non - zero value of @xmath29 at more than 4.4 standard deviations .    from equations ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) , one obtains @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the boron neutrino flux and sno nc flux normalized to the central ssm boron neutrino flux , respectively .",
    "the ( @xmath75 )  degeneracy is , thus , lifted by the use of equation(3 ) .    in figure 3 ,",
    "we plot @xmath40 ( equation ( 24 ) ) as a function of x. the active neutrino fraction , @xmath40 , increases with the increase in the sno cc flux and decrease in the sno nc flux .",
    "thus , the sterile fraction in the active solar boron neutrino flux , @xmath76 , will be larger if the forthcoming measurements at sno favor smaller values of cc flux and larger values of nc flux . for @xmath67 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "thus , the sterile fraction in the boron neutrino flux is non - zero at about @xmath79 indicating oscillation of boron neutrinos into sterile states in the current sno data .",
    "the behavior of @xmath80 with x in the present work is different from that reported by balentekin et al .",
    "@xcite by identifying @xmath27 with @xmath22 and substituting the numerical value of @xmath22 obtained in the pure @xmath81 scenario .",
    "however , as discussed earlier , such an approach can not be used to derive meaningful constraints on the sterile fraction .",
    "the boron neutrino flux obtained from equation ( 25 ) has been plotted as a function of x in figure 4 .",
    "most of the 1@xmath0  region of the boron neutrino flux lies above its central value in the ssm in contradiction with the value of boron neutrino flux in the pure lma scenario .",
    "in conclusion , the prospects for constraining the sterile neutrino fraction in the born neutrino flux reaching the earth have been examined in a scenario discussed by hollanda and smirnov @xcite to overcome some generic problems of the lma scenario .",
    "the indications for the presence of sterile component in the boron neutrino flux in the light of the latest sno salt phase data and the 766.3 ty kamland data are found to be strong enough to be taken seriously .",
    "a precise determination of the cc and nc fluxes at sno within the present @xmath59 range gives a transition probability into sterile states which is non - zero at more than @xmath82 .",
    "it is found that the sterile component in the boron neutrino flux could be as large as the electron neutrino flux for the present central values of sno cc and nc fluxes .",
    "if the future measurements at sno yield smaller values of cc / nc flux ratio , the sterile fraction will be , further , enhanced . thus , there are strong indications of a sterile presence in the boron neutrino flux reaching the detectors on the earth but it will require a precise determination of cc and nc fluxes to pass a final judgment .",
