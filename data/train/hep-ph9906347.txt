    "the strange nature of quantum correlations between separated systems , pointed out for the first time by einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) [ 1 ] , has stimulated a lively debate .",
    "the incompatibility between quantum theory predictions and local realism ( lr ) consequences became evident with the 1965 work of bell [ 2 ] , showing that a wide class of local hidden - variable models satisfies an inequality which is violated by quantum mechanics ( qm ) .    in 1969",
    "clauser , holt , shimony and horne [ 3 ] stressed that bell s inequality could be experimentally checked with photon pairs emitted by single atoms , even with the available low efficiency photon counters , if a suitable additional assumption was made .",
    "several experimental investigations of the epr paradox have accordingly been performed , mostly with photon - polarization correlation measurements using radiative atomic cascade transitions [ 4 ] . in these experiments",
    "the inequality was found to be violated and the quantum mechanical predictions turned out to agree with the data .",
    "it has been pointed out , however , that the introduction of additional assumptions has led to the formulation of inequalities different from ( and stronger than ) bell s original inequality [ 5,6 ] .",
    "the experimental results violated the stronger inequalities but were still compatible with bell s original one , which was deduced from local realism alone .",
    "this allows the argument that the evidence is against the additional assumptions but not against lr .",
    "therefore from a strictly logical point of view , the choice between lr and the existing quantum theory has to be done yet .",
    "since the atomic physics experiments are not loophole free and thus have not been able to settle unambiguously that lr should be discarded , it is worthwhile to study the epr paradox in domains where highly efficient particle detectors can be used and the additional assumptions are not needed .",
    "indeed the behaviour of a pair of neutral pseudo - scalar mesons ( e.g. @xmath3 or @xmath4 ) , anti - correlated in flavour if produced by the decay of a @xmath5 state ( e.g. the @xmath6 or the @xmath7 resonances ) seems even more puzzling than the behaviour of spin correlated pairs of stable particles ( photons or electrons ) .",
    "a critical discussion of the epr paradox for @xmath3 pairs and of the earlier attempts to check bell s inequality in kaon @xmath6 decays was made by ghirardi , grassi and weber [ 7 ] .",
    "the main argument was that bell s inequality , written in terms of four different times of flight of the kaons , is not violated by the quantum - mechanical two - time joint probability for correlated strangeness , due to the specific values of kaon masses and decay widths .",
    "it could easily be shown in the same way that an analogous argument holds for @xmath8 mesons .",
    "recently further bell - type tests involving new bell - like inequalities for correlated neutral meson - anti meson pairs have been proposed and discussed [ 8 ] .",
    "however , some of them would probe only a restricted class of local realistic theories whereas others avoid this difficulty but require experimental set - ups not available in the near future [ 6 ] .",
    "but bell s inequality is only one of the many consequences of lr : epr correlations can provide tests sensitive to possible deviations from qm .",
    "meaningful tests of lr , not of the bell - type , have been proposed for the @xmath9 system [ 9,10 ] . in the present paper , after developing a very general local realistic theory for the @xmath10 system ( following the ideas in [ 9 ] and [ 10 ] ) , a test to discriminate between qm and lr is proposed and its feasibility with an asymmetric b - factory is discussed .",
    "only a few works on epr tests refer to the @xmath11 system [ 11 ] and use a _ decoherence parameter _",
    "@xmath12 ( such that the qm interference term is multiplied by a factor @xmath13 ) to measure deviations from qm . combining already presently data ( from _ cleo _ and _ argus _ and from lep experiments ) they deduce a clear indication in favour of qm .",
    "however this is an expected conclusion taking into account that falsification of @xmath14 means simply a falsification of the spontaneous factorization hypothesis ( sfh ) .",
    "indeed sfh was already falsified with gamma ray pairs from @xmath15 annihilations [ 12 ] , with atomic photon pairs [ 13 ] and recently with kaons pairs produced in @xmath16 annihilations [ 14 ] . on the other hand it is possible to reproduce within the local realistic approach all non paradoxical predictions of qm , anti - correlations in _ strangeness _ and _ cp _ ( or _ beauty _ and _ mass _ )",
    "included , which are absent in sfh ; thus sfh violation is also predicted by any reasonable approach based on lr .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "the b - meson pair correlation and the quantum - mechanical formalism are reviewed . in the third section a local realistic theory for the @xmath10 system",
    "is accurately developed and its predictions , different from those of qm , are discussed . in the fourth section",
    "we stress the asymmetric collider allows to perform time - dependent measurement and then discuss how our epr test can be performed using techniques and methods peculiar to lifetime and mixing measurement .",
    "let us briefly review the quantum - mechanical basic formalism for the epr - correlated @xmath4 pairs that can be created as decay products of the @xmath7 resonance .",
    "more precisely @xmath1 pairs are produced since @xmath7 is not heavy enough to decay into @xmath17 pairs . from now on the index _ d _ will be dropped to simplify notation : with @xmath18 a @xmath0 will be intended .    in the quark model",
    "the resonance @xmath7 is a @xmath19 state with quantum numbers @xmath5 . in the strong decay @xmath20",
    "the created pair inherits the @xmath7 quantum numbers . since b - mesons",
    "are spinless @xmath21 implies that the @xmath4 pair is in a _",
    "p - wave _ total angular momentum state .",
    "@xmath22 implies that the flavour part of the pair wavefunction is antisymmetric . therefore immediately after the decay ( namely at @xmath23 ) the @xmath4 state vector is given , in the @xmath7-frame , by    @xmath24    where @xmath25(@xmath26 )",
    "denote the b - mesons motion directions `` left''(``right '' ) and @xmath27 , @xmath28 are _ beauty eigenstates _",
    "( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) .",
    "possible tiny cp - violation will be neglected throughout this paper since it could not appreciably modify the large difference between lr and qm predictions that will be found .",
    "thus the _ mass eigenstates _",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath32 ( @xmath33 for `` heavy '' and @xmath34 for `` light '' such that @xmath35 ) can be identified with _",
    "cp eigenstates _ :    @xmath36    and the state vector ( 1 ) can also be expressed as    @xmath37    the time evolution of the complex mass eigenstates is given by    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the particle proper time and ( with @xmath40 )    @xmath41    ( the two neutral b - mesons are expected to have a negligible difference in lifetime ) .",
    "the time evolution operator for state ( 1 ) is the product of the time evolution operators for single b - mesons states , so that , at proper times @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the time evolved state for the @xmath4 pair can be written as    @xmath44    the different exponentials in ( 6 ) generate @xmath45 and @xmath46 components . indeed",
    "the time evolution of @xmath18 , @xmath47 is governed by a weak interaction that does not conserve flavour and thus allows @xmath48 oscillations to take place between the _ flavour eigenstates _",
    "( @xmath48 _ mixing _ ) .",
    "the probabilities of @xmath4 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 observations are given ( using ( 6 ) and ( 2 ) ) by    @xmath49=\\frac{1}{4}e(t_{r}+t_{l})[1+cos ( \\delta m ( t_{r}-t_{l}))]=p^{qm}[\\overline{b^{0}}(t_{l});b^{0}(t_{r})]\\ ] ]    @xmath50=\\frac{1}{4}e(t_{r}+t_{l})[1-cos(\\delta m ( t_{r}-t_{l}))]=p^{qm}[\\overline{b^{0}}(t_{l});\\overline{b^{0}}(t_{r})]\\ ] ]    where @xmath51 .",
    "for @xmath52 eq .",
    "( 8) vanishes and the probability of having like flavours is zero .",
    "this flavour anti - correlation means that the two neutral b - mesons evolve in phase so that at equal proper times , until one of them decays , there are always a @xmath18 and a @xmath47 present .",
    "let us consider the following flavour asymmetry    @xmath53-p[\\overline{b^{0}}(t_{l } ) ; \\overline{b^{0}}(t_{r } ) ] } { p[b^{0}(t_{l});\\overline{b^{0}}(t_{r})]+p[\\overline{b^{0}}(t_{l});\\overline{b^{0}}(t_{r } ) ] } \\ ] ]    that will be our fundamental parameter for the comparison between quantum theory and the local realistic predictions . from the experimental point of view the advantage of considering ratios of probabilities or number of events is that systematic errors tend to cancel .    in qm",
    "the asymmetry ( 9 ) is predicted to be a very simple function of @xmath54 only ( by ( 7 ) and ( 8) ) :    @xmath55    where [ 15 ]    @xmath56    we will show that the asymmetry predicted by lr is necessarily quite different from ( 10 ) .",
    "the epr paradox arises from the incompatibility at the empirical level between the predictions of quantum theory and local realism .",
    "the latter can be expressed by the following three assumptions :    \\(i ) if , without in any way disturbing a system , we can predict with certainty the value of a physical quantity , then there exists an element of physical reality corresponding to this physical quantity ( _ epr reality criterion _ ) .",
    "\\(ii ) if two physical systems ( e.g. our two neutral b mesons ) are separated by a large distance , an element of reality belonging to one of them can not have been created by a measurement performed on the other one ( _ separability _ ) .",
    "\\(iii ) if at a given time @xmath39 a physical system has an element of reality , the latter can not be created by measurements performed on the same system at time @xmath57 ( _ no retroactive causality _ ) .",
    "local realism can be applied to the @xmath18 meson pairs described quantum mechanically by the state vector ( 6 ) , by considering only those predictions of ( 6 ) to which epr reality criterion can be applied .",
    "these are _ flavour _ and _ mass _ anti - correlations .",
    "obviously , if such anti - correlations were not found to exist experimentally , our conclusions could not be correct . if they are assumed to exist",
    ", one can say the following [ 9 ] :    \\a ) each b meson of every pair has an associated element of reality @xmath58 which determines a well defined value of mass ( @xmath59 corresponds to @xmath60 , respectively ) ;    \\b ) each b meson of every pair has an associated element of reality @xmath61 which determines a well defined value of flavour ( @xmath62 corresponds to @xmath63 , respectively ) .",
    "furthermore @xmath64 is not a stable property : it has sudden jumps , from @xmath65 to @xmath66 and vice - versa , that are simultaneous for the two mesons of every pair but happen at random times in a statistical ensemble of many pairs .",
    "notice that the application of local realism to the physical situation described by ( 6 ) has brought us , at least formally , outside quantum theory : no quantum mechanical state vector exists , in fact , which can describe a b meson as having simultaneously well defined mass and flavour values .",
    "this is of course the standard approach of all realistic interpretations of quantum phenomena .    following the treatment in [ 9 ] and [ 10 ] relative to k - mesons and taking into account the analogy ( _",
    "strangeness_,_cp _ ) @xmath67 ( _ beauty _ , _ mass _ ) , four b - meson basic states , characterized by _ beauty _ and _ mass _ both definite , can be introduced :    @xmath68    the probabilities of observing the i - th state at proper time t conditional on an initial j - th state at proper time zero are :    @xmath69 probability of @xmath70 at time @xmath39 given @xmath71 at time @xmath72 ( @xmath73 )    for the left going ( @xmath25 ) meson , and    @xmath74 probability of @xmath70 at time @xmath39 given @xmath71 at time @xmath72 ( @xmath73 )    for the right going ( @xmath26 ) meson .",
    "the symbols @xmath75 and @xmath76 will be used for all the probabilities of the left and right going meson respectively .",
    "it can be shown that all the physical conditions imposed by qm to single @xmath77-mesons are satisfied by the probabilities of lr which can be collected in a `` probability matrix '' @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 , etc . , and    @xmath81\\ ] ]",
    "so that @xmath82 .",
    "the proof of ( 13 ) is strictly analogous to that for neutral kaons published in [ 9 ] .",
    "it has been shown that this set of probabilities is unique within the local realistic approach [ 6 ] .",
    "the physical situation described in qm by the wave function ( 1 ) corresponds to the initial lr probabilities    @xmath83    where @xmath84 is the probability of the state @xmath70 ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "our present task is to find the maximum and minimum values allowed by lr for the asymmetry parameter @xmath86 , for @xmath87 .",
    "two time probabilities can be written by means of probabilities with three indices by using bayes formula [ 16 ] :    @xmath88    where @xmath89 is the probability of having @xmath70 at time @xmath43 and @xmath71 at time @xmath42 given a @xmath90 at time @xmath72 ( @xmath91 ) . to simplify the notation ,",
    "let us set @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "one must have    @xmath96    @xmath97    because the left hand sides are the probabilities of @xmath70 at time @xmath43 ( @xmath98 ) summed over all possible states at time @xmath42 , given a @xmath99 at time 0 .",
    "therefore the left hand sides of ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) must equal @xmath100 and @xmath101 , which are given by ( 13 ) . to ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) we can add    @xmath102    @xmath103    where @xmath104 . the left hand side of ( 19 ) is the probability that the meson is either @xmath105 or @xmath106 ( then that is undecayed at @xmath43 ) and that it is @xmath107 , given that it was @xmath108 .",
    "the meaning of ( 20 ) is similar .",
    "the probabilities on the right hand sides of ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) are again given by ( 13 ) .",
    "therefore ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) can be written as    @xmath109    @xmath110    because of @xmath111 .",
    "four unknown probabilities appear in ( 17 ) , ( 18 ) and ( 21 ) , ( 22 ) .",
    "these equations are however not independent because the sum of ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) equals the sum of ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) ( remember that @xmath112 ) .",
    "one can write three probabilities in terms of @xmath113 :    @xmath114    where the arguments @xmath115 of the three time probabilities have been omitted , as it will be done systematically in the following .",
    "obvious upper and lower limits for @xmath113 are    @xmath116    as follow from ( 17 ) and ( 21 ) .",
    "analogous limits can be obtained for the other three probabilities which , using ( 23 ) , can be translated into further limitations for @xmath113 .",
    "the overall result is    @xmath117    where @xmath118 when different limitations are given it is useful to adopt the most stringent ones .",
    "for this reason in ( 26 ) the maximum of the minima and the minimum of the maxima are considered .",
    "which one of the two terms within curly brackets has to be chosen depends on @xmath42 and @xmath43 ; for instance @xmath119 can be positive or negative depending on the considered times .",
    "equations similar to ( 17 ) , ( 18 ) and ( 21 ) , ( 22 ) can be written for an initial @xmath120 .",

    "conclusions similar to ( 23)-(25 ) must then hold for these new probabilities , by applying the same interchange .",

    "it is interesting to notice that the difference between the predictions of qm and lr is higher in the @xmath48 system than in the @xmath9 system , after comparison with the results of ref .",

    "detector at slac [ 17 ] , and the kek - b storage ring with _ belle _ detector at kek [ 18 ] , will provide a powerful tool to perform the epr test just proposed .",

    "firstly we review some characteristics and experimental parameters concerning asymmetric b - factories , then we suggest two methods to perform the epr test and finally we provide a quantitative evaluation for the test feasibility .",
    "the asymmetry ( 9 ) , as predicted by qm , depends on the difference of the two b - meson proper decay times @xmath157 . the asymmetric collider configuration and an accurate vertex determination make the @xmath157 determination possible . indeed , the fundamental reason for developing asymmetric b - factories is the need to measure small proper time intervals , whereas a precise vertex detector is necessary to measure a space dependence from which the time dependence can be deduced .",
    "time measurements would not be feasible if the @xmath7 , having energy just over the @xmath8 meson pair production threshold , were produced at rest : the b mesons have very low momentum ( @xmath158 ) in the center - of - mass frame and the paths between production and decays are too small ( @xmath159 in average ) to be measured even by silicon vertex detectors .",
    "therefore proper decay time measurements require the asymmetric beam configuration that produces the @xmath7 resonance in motion in the laboratory frame , thus allowing the expansion between the two decay positions . neglecting b - mesons motion in the @xmath7-frame ,",
    "the proper time difference is in good approximation given by @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the distance between the two b decay vertices measured in the laboratory , along the beams direction , and @xmath162 is the lorentz boost factor due to the asymmetric beam energies .",

    "to measure cp asymmetries one looks for events where one neutral b meson decays into an hadronic cp - eigenstate at the time @xmath169 while the other decays , at @xmath170 , to a semi - leptonic or hadronic _ tagging mode _ that acts as a b - flavour identifier : @xmath171 .    on the other hand mixing measurement can be based on double tagged dileptonic events .",
    "it must be pointed out that the dilepton approach with a time - dependent asymmetry is different from the usual time - integrated dilepton methods developed at a symmetric @xmath156 collider at @xmath7 ( by cleo experiment ) which allows only the measurement of @xmath172 .",
    "most lifetime measurement methods rely on the determination of both the secondary vertices and of the primary one , the @xmath7 decay point ; an exclusive reconstruction for at least one b meson is needed , while the other b can be partially reconstructed or only vertexed .    in general the resolution achievable in individual tracks reconstruction",
    "is limited by multiple scattering introduced primarily by the beam pipe . the resolution @xmath166 ( for example @xmath173 ) is primarily determined by the error in tagged vertex position @xmath174 [ 17,18 ] .",
    "typical values are @xmath175 for a fully reconstructed b meson and @xmath176 for a partially reconstructed one .",
    "in clean hadronic channels and in lepton tagging better resolution can be achieved in principle thus together providing @xmath166 better than @xmath167 for the cp analysis and @xmath177 in the dilepton analysis . on the other hand non - gaussian tails with @xmath178 for",
    "a significant fraction of the selected samples may partially spoil these resolutions .",
    "in conclusion we assume that the asymmetric machine configuration and high performance in b vertexing will provide time - dependent measurements with @xmath166 of the order of @xmath179 so that @xmath180 .",
    "the @xmath7 decays almost exclusively to pairs of b mesons , that are neutral with a probability of about @xmath181 . in such cases",
    "no ionizing particle comes out of the @xmath2 decay point which is thus not directly measurable .",
    "this in turn does not permit to record and use decay distances in lifetime determination .",
    "however lifetime measurements can be performed , without knowing the b - mesons production point , using only the @xmath161 measurement . on the other hand",
    "a more sophisticated method of reconstructing the geometry and the kinematics of the events has been developed in _",
    "babar _ in order to perform more direct lifetime measurements [ 17 ] .",
    "this method can suggest how to perform a measurement of the asymmetry ( 9 ) by measuring not only @xmath157 but also one time of flight ( @xmath182 , subsection @xmath183 ) as needed by the local realistic time dependence .    in this method",

    "thus a gain in measurement accuracy is provided by adding kinematical constraints to the standard geometrical fit of the decay vertices .    to perform the epr test the quantities @xmath188 , @xmath189 must be both small enough in order to allow an effective time - dependent analysis .",
    "qualitatively @xmath166 and @xmath190 should be smaller than half the average separation between vertices , and the typical value of @xmath191 ( @xmath192 ) could be adequate . this requirement could be satisfied with both the b mesons fully reconstructed and using the algorithm mentioned above . on the other hand ,",
    "as the rate of fully reconstructible b mesons is likely to be of the order of @xmath193 or less [ 17 ] , the second decay should not be fully reconstructed in order to get sufficient statistics in a relatively short time .",
    "however for this second decay no vertexing technique can provide a @xmath190 smaller than @xmath167 . from the point of view of the epr test",
    "it is preferable to use the @xmath182 time only if it belongs to the fully reconstructed b meson .",
    "this is only satisfied on average in one half of the events and reduces the statistics by one half but to a level still higher than achievable considering both fully reconstructed b mesons .",
    "a way to experimentally obtain the asymmetry ( 9 ) , in order to test the quantum mechanical and local realistic predictions , ( 10 ) and ( 45 ) respectively , can be based on the measurement of the time - dependent mixing .    since @xmath194=p[\\overline{b^{0}}(t_{l } ) ; b^{0}(t_{r } ) ] , p[\\overline{b^{0}}(t_{l } ) ; \\overline{b^{0}}(t_{r})]=p[b^{0}(t_{l } ) ; b^{0}(t_{r})]$ ] hold both in qm and in lr , the asymmetry ( 9 ) can be written as    @xmath53+p[\\overline{b^{0}}(t_{l } ) ; b^{0}(t_{r})]-p[\\overline{b^{0}}(t_{l } ) ; \\overline{b^{0}}(t_{r})]-p[b^{0}(t_{l } ) ; b^{0}(t_{r } ) ] } { p[b^{0}(t_{l});\\overline{b^{0}}(t_{r})]+p[\\overline{b^{0}}(t_{l } ) ; b^{0}(t_{r})]+p[\\overline{b^{0}}(t_{l});\\overline{b^{0}}(t_{r})]+p[b^{0}(t_{l } ) ; b^{0}(t_{r } ) ] } \\ ] ]    and also as    @xmath195    where @xmath196 represents the number of unlike - flavour events .    in lr the asymmetry",
    "depends not only on @xmath157 , as in qm , but also on @xmath153 .",
    "however the local realistic time dependence on @xmath157 could be directly compared to that of qm , for instance by performing a partial time integration , namely an integration on @xmath197 for @xmath198 with the constraint @xmath199 . moreover , considering that a very large fraction of the events ( double b - decays ) is included in the double requirement ( @xmath200 and @xmath201 ) , for a given @xmath200 these events are characterized by values of @xmath157 belonging to the time interval @xmath202 $ ] , for which the local realistic prediction is always below the quantum mechanical one .",
    "thus a total integration on @xmath197 is clearly allowed .",
    "this permits to consider the following quantity simplified in its time dependence :    @xmath203    therefore , considering a dilepton tagging approach to obtain experimentally the asymmetry ( 50 ) , one can measure the asymmetry    @xmath204    by counting the number of _ like - sign _ and _ unlike - sign _ events , @xmath205 and @xmath206 ) , as a function of @xmath207 .",
    "as the @xmath161 resolution for the cascade leptons is too large , in the mixing study the b - meson flavour is correlated only with the sign of the direct leptons ( distinguished by their harder momentum spectrum ) , and the cascade ones act as a source of _ mistagging _ [ 17 ] . to obtain the yield of dilepton events from semi - leptonic decays of @xmath208 pairs ,",
    "several other backgrounds must be subtracted , such as dileptons from the non resonant process at @xmath7 ( _ continuum _ ) and hadrons misidentified as leptons ( _ fake leptons _ ) .",
    "two methods , based on lifetime and mixing measurements , have been proposed to perform the epr test .",
    "the former , needing time - dependent measurement not only for @xmath157 but also for @xmath209 , requires an exclusive channels approach .",
    "its need of larger statistics suggests the choice of the latter method to experimentally obtain the asymmetry ( 9 ) for an initial study .",
    "the _ babar _ relative accuracy of about @xmath193 in @xmath168 [ 17 ] with only one year data taking at nominal luminosity ( @xmath210 ) suggests that at the same time an accuracy on the asymmetry ( 9 ) largely sufficient to discriminate between qm and lr predictions should be obtained .",
    "the number of events required to obtain a given level of separation between the two theoretical predictions provides a quantitative evaluation of the power of the proposed test .",
    "the number of @xmath208 events to be produced , in order to measure an asymmetry @xmath86 with a statistical error @xmath211 is approximately given by    @xmath212    where @xmath213 represents the product of all dilution factors , @xmath214 is the total detection efficiency and @xmath215 ( @xmath216 ) is the branching ratio into the dileptonic final state .",
    "the corresponding needed luminosity integrated over one typical year is    @xmath217    where @xmath218 is the cross section for @xmath219 production at the @xmath7 . neglecting higher order effects due to backgrounds , the total dilution factor @xmath213 is simply given by the tagging dilution factor @xmath220 where the _ mistag probability _",
    "@xmath221 is the probability that a @xmath4 pair is tagged as a @xmath222 or @xmath46 pair .",
    "typical values are @xmath223 and @xmath224 [ 17 ] .    @xmath225 has been evaluated requiring the separation between the integrated values of @xmath226 and @xmath227 to be at least @xmath228 over an appropriate interval of the decay time distribution for @xmath4 pairs .",
    "considering that @xmath157 and @xmath153 both greater than @xmath229 give a large difference between the two predictions , one obtains @xmath230 .",
    "this is enough to discriminate between the two theoretical predictions .",
    "the larger luminosity of @xmath210 , integrated in one nominal year , will allow a more detailed and stringent test .",
    "developing a very general local realistic theory of correlated @xmath1 a not - of - bell - type epr test has been proposed to discriminate between quantum mechanics and local realism .",
    "indeed the asymmetry for observing neutral @xmath8 meson pairs with like and unlike flavour predicted by local realism is remarkably different from the quantum mechanical prediction .",
    "this test can be based on mixing and lifetime measurements to be carried out by the experiments at the asymmetric b - factories and therefore is not only experimentally feasible but can be effectively performed quite soon if the expectations on the colliders luminosity and the detectors performance will be fulfilled by _ babar _ and _ belle _ collaborations .",
    "we would like to thank l. lanceri for fruitful discussions on the experimental test feasibility and g. nardulli for his comments .",
