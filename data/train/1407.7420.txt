    "increasing @xmath0 above @xmath34 , the receding lamella can not fully restore back to a spherical shape due to the jamming of particles inside the marble ( fig .",

    "[ figure2]d - f )",
    ". a model based on the above picture will be constructed in the next section to quantitatively describe the size of granular residues .",
    "theoretical understanding of the s - h scaling in asteroid impacts is solely based on similarity and dimensional analyses independent of detailed dynamics of impact cratering processes @xcite , which can thus be equally applied for liquid - drop impact cratering .",
    "however , dimensional analysis alone can not reveal physical mechanisms associated with the liquid - drop impact process .",
    "hence , it is more useful to look into the physical picture derived from the studies of asteroid impact cratering , which may help to explain the origin of the s - h scaling in liquid - drop impact cratering . during asteroid impacts , a large fraction of @xmath0 ( over @xmath37 for high - velocity impacts )",
    "dissipates into heat rather than transferring to the kinetic energy of ejecta @xcite .",
    "the conversion efficiency of @xmath0 into the kinetic energy is determined by the impact pressure @xcite .",
    "such a large energy partitioning is believed to give rise to the s - h scaling , which expresses a mixture of energy and momentum scaling with the power exponent between 1/4 and 1/7 @xcite .",
    "large energy partitioning also occurs during liquid - drop impacts . only a small fraction of @xmath0 converts into the kinetic energy of particles , while the rest turns into the surface energy and viscous dissipation of spreading lamella .",
    "since both the surface energy and the viscous dissipation increase with the maximal contact surface between the lamella and the granular bed ( @xmath38 ) , a larger @xmath39 leads to a lower energy conversion .",
    "thus , we propose a simple formula for the coefficient of energy conversion : @xmath40 , where @xmath41 provides the only relevant area for normalization .",
    "the fraction of energy for ejecting particles is then @xmath42 with @xmath43 automatically satisfied by construction .",
    "@xmath44 is consistent with recent experiments that estimate the momentum of ejected particles @xcite .",
    "finally , an energy scaling argument similar to that used for solid - sphere impacts can be applied : instead of @xmath0 , @xmath44 lifts granular particles in a crater of volume @xmath45 to a height determined by @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath46 , where @xmath8 is the volume fraction of the bed and @xmath47 is the particle density .",
    "if we approximate the crater as a paraboloid and replace @xmath48 , then @xmath49 .",
    "taken together , we successfully recover the s - h scaling : @xmath50 . \\label{equ2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] moreover , with @xmath51 for liquid - drop impact craters ( fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ) , we have the dimensionless prefactor @xmath52 , quantitatively matching our measurement @xmath53 ( fig .  [",
    "figure3]b ) .",
    "hence , the scaling analysis provides a quantitative description for both the diameter and the depth of the liquid - drop impact craters .     versus @xmath0 .",
    "crater morphologies shown in fig .  [ figure2]a - f are indicated .",
    "stars mark the transition impact energy @xmath34 between the low and high @xmath0 regime for each drop size .",
    "solid lines are from the liquid marble model ( eq .  [ equ3 ] ) .",
    "the dashed line is @xmath54 calculated by combining the liquid marble model ( eq .  [ equ3 ] ) with the jamming criterion ( eq .  [ equ5 ] ) . ]",
    "it should be clear from the above derivation that the energy partitioning of liquid - drop impact cratering and asteroid impact cratering shares a quantitative similarity .",
    "the forms of energy dissipation in the two processes are obviously different . for asteroid impacts ,",
    "the impact energy is primarily dissipated by shock - wave heating of the asteroid and the target during the initial stage of the impact event @xcite . for liquid - drop impacts",
    ", it dissipates mainly through the deformation and viscous dissipation of the liquid drops .",
    "however , the ratio of the energy dissipation over the total impact energy seems to follow the same quantitative trend in the two processes .",
    "hence , it would be interesting to check if the energy conversion coefficient of asteroid impact cratering is also inversely proportional to the surface area of impact craters , i.e. , @xmath55 . without shock - wave heating or projectile deformation , a large energy partitioning does not occur in low - speed solid - sphere impact cratering .",
    "most of the impact energy is thus directly converted into the kinetic energy of granular particles for creating impact craters , which leads to the 1/4 power as dictated by the energy scaling @xcite .    finally , it is also interesting to compare liquid - drop impact cratering and asteroid impact cratering more generally in terms of hydrodynamic similarity and the states of matter .",
    "firstly , it is known that the important dimensionless number governing asteroid impact cratering is the inverse froude number , fr@xmath56 @xcite . for typical asteroid impacts , @xmath57 fr@xmath58 @xmath59 , which overlaps well with our liquid - drop impact experiments @xmath60 fr@xmath58 @xmath61 .",
    "secondly , in studying asteroid impact cratering , the impacted surface is frequently modeled as a bingham fluid @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", granular materials typically display bingham fluid behavior @xcite .",
    "more importantly , during asteroid strikes , the impact pressure can rise as high as @xmath62 gpa and the temperature may increase above 2000 @xmath63c . under such extreme conditions , asteroids of normal composition",
    "have already been liquefied if not vaporized @xcite .",
    "hence , liquid drops provide a better model than solid spheres for high - energy asteroids .",
    "this important analogy has been overlooked in many previous attempts in search of the link between asteroid impact cratering and low - speed solid - spheres impact cratering @xcite .      the model for granular residues",
    "can be divided into two parts : ( 1 ) based on the liquid marble model , we will show a quantitative understanding of the size of granular residues at low @xmath0 .",
    "( 2 ) employing the concept of the jamming transition , we will calculate the transition energy @xmath34 between the low and high energy regimes ( fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] ) .",
    "\\(1 ) as shown previously , the slow increase of @xmath17 at low @xmath0 is due to the formation of liquid marbles ( fig .",
    "[ figure2]a - c ) .",
    "@xmath17 in this regime is equal to the diameter of liquid marbles .",
    "a simple model can thus be constructed based on the liquid marble model proposed by aussillous and qur @xcite .",
    "firstly , the number of entrained particles at the lamella - granular bed interface , @xmath64 , is proportional to the maximal contact area between the lamella and the bed .",
    "therefore , @xmath65 .",
    "the volume of the liquid marble is simply the sum of the volume of the drop and the volume of entrained particles : @xmath66 .",
    "if we assume the marble is spherical , then the effective diameter of the liquid marble is @xmath67 . for @xmath68 ,",
    "the liquid marble maintains a spherical shape , where @xmath69 is the capillary length , @xmath70 is the surface tension of the liquid and @xmath71 is the density of the liquid - granular mixture .",
    "the diameter of the liquid marble and , therefore , the diameter of the granular residue is simply @xmath72 .",
    "however , for @xmath73 , the marble deforms into a puddle under the force of gravity . the thickness of the puddle is given by @xmath74 .",
    "if we approximate the shape of the puddle as an oblate ellipsoid , then the diameter of the marble is given by @xmath75 . in summary",
    ", we have @xmath76 where we add two proportionality constants @xmath77 and @xmath78 to account for the fact that @xmath79 is close to @xmath80 between the two limiting cases and the approximation taken for the shape of the puddle . replacing @xmath1 in @xmath81 using the s - h scaling ( eq .  [ equ2 ] ) , we finally reach @xmath82",
    ". the results quantitatively agrees with our measurements ( solid lines in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] ) with the fitting parameters @xmath83 and @xmath84 on the order of one .",
    "\\(2 ) increasing @xmath0 further , at the transition impact energy @xmath34 , the retraction of lamella is arrested before it can fully restore back to a sphere , which leads to asymmetric granular residues with quickly enlarging @xmath17 and results in a crossover from the low - energy `` liquid marble '' regime to the high - energy regime ( fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] ) .",
    "as discussed previously , the resistance against the capillary retraction comes from the jamming of entrained particles .",
    "thus , we can identify @xmath34 as the `` jamming energy '' of liquid - drop impact process .",
    "note that the particles entrained at the liquid interface are gradually pushed into the interior of the receding liquid lamella due to the strong capillary retraction .",
    "hence , the jamming occurs in the bulk of liquid marble rather than only at its interface @xcite .",
    "versus drop size @xmath4 .",
    "solid line is based on the jamming criterion ( eq .  [ equ5 ] ) . ]    a simple analysis based on the liquid marble model can show that the number of entrained particles at the lamella - granular interface is not sufficient to jam the liquid marble at @xmath34 . to reach the jamming transition , the effect of liquid imbibition during the impact needs to be considered @xcite .",
    "we estimate the volume of imbibed liquid into the bed , @xmath85 , based on the well - established washburn - lucas equation @xcite , which leads to the following equation specifically for liquid - drop impact cratering ( si ) : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the liquid viscosity and @xmath88 is a proportionality constant of order one .",
    "the jamming transition at @xmath34 can then be expressed as : @xmath89 with the jamming volume fraction @xmath90 @xcite . using the s - h scaling for @xmath1 , eq .",
    "[ equ5 ] quantitatively agrees with our measurement on @xmath34 for different @xmath4 with the fitting constant @xmath91 ( fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] ) .",
    "finally , in combination with the liquid marble model , we also reach @xmath54 ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] ) ( see si for additional comments ) .",
    "when a liquid drop impacts on a granular surface , the impact energy is converted into the surface energy of the deformed drop , the internal energy of liquid and particles , and the kinetic energy of the spreading lamella and ejected particles . the process is notoriously complicated , involving high reynolds hydrodynamics , shock compression in the impinging drop , fast granular flows and capillary interactions between fluid and granular particles . given the complexity , it is surprising that the simple model presented here can quantitatively captures the morphology of liquid - drop impact craters over a large range of impact energy .",
    "such a model will be considerable useful for predicting the outcome of raindrop impacts on granular media  a ubiquitous process occurring in numerous natural , agricultural and industrial circumstances .",
    "moreover , our study reveals a quantitative similarity between raindrop impact cratering and asteroid impact cratering in terms of both the energy scaling and the aspect ratio of their impact craters . comparing with extensively - studied low - speed solid - sphere impact cratering",
    ", liquid - drop impact cratering provides a better analogy to high - energy asteroid impact cratering .",

    "nevertheless , the remarkable similarity between the two processes indicates that they may share common mechanisms that are worth further investigation .    for all the experiments and data presented in the main text , we used deionized water as our liquid drops and 90 @xmath94 15 @xmath7 m soda - lime glass beads ( @xmath952.52 g/@xmath96 , mosci ) as our granular particles . in supporting information ( si )",

    "moreover , in si , we used several different liquids including methanol , ethylene glycol , mineral oil , water - glycerin mixtures and sodium dodecyl sulfate solutions as liquid drops to probe the effect of liquid viscosity and surface tension on the impact cratering process . a brief discussion of liquid - drop impact cratering on wet granular bed is also presented in si .",
    "a photron sa - x2 camera was used for high - speed imaging of drop impact dynamics .",

    "the camera and the profilometer was further combined to monitor the depth of crater during impacts .",

    "<S> when a granular material is impacted by a sphere , its surface deforms like a liquid yet it preserves a circular crater like a solid . </S>",
    "<S> although the mechanism of granular impact cratering by solid spheres is well explored , our knowledge on granular impact cratering by liquid drops is still very limited . here , by combining high - speed photography with high - precision laser profilometry </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate liquid - drop impact dynamics on granular surface and monitor the morphology of resulting impact craters . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , we find that , despite the enormous energy and length difference , granular impact cratering by liquid drops follows the same energy scaling and reproduces the same crater morphology as that of asteroid impact craters . inspired by this similarity , we integrate the physical insight from planetary sciences , the liquid marble model from fluid mechanics and the concept of jamming transition from granular physics into a simple theoretical framework that quantitatively describes all the main features of liquid - drop imprints in granular media . </S>",
    "<S> our study sheds light on the mechanisms governing raindrop impacts on granular surfaces and reveals a remarkable analogy between familiar phenomena of raining and catastrophic asteroid strikes .    </S>",
    "<S> ranular impact cratering by liquid drops is likely familiar to all of us who have watched raindrops splashing in a backyard or on a beach . </S>",
    "<S> it is directly relevant to many important natural , agricultural and industrial processes such as soil erosion @xcite , drip irrigation @xcite , dispersion of micro - organisms in soil @xcite , and spray - coating of particles and powders . </S>",
    "<S> the vestige of raindrop imprints in fossilized granular media has even been used to infer air density on earth 2.7 billion years ago @xcite . hence , understanding the dynamics of liquid - drop impacts on granular media and predicting the morphology of resulting impact craters are of great importance for a wide range of basic research and practical applications .    </S>",
    "<S> directly related to two long - standing problems in fluid and granular physics research , i.e. , drop impact on solid / liquid surfaces @xcite and granular impact cratering by solid spheres @xcite , liquid drop impact on granular surfaces is surely more complicated . </S>",
    "<S> although several recent experiments have been attempted to investigate the morphology of liquid - drop impact craters @xcite , a coherent picture for describing various features of the impact craters is still lacking . even for the most straightforward impact - energy ( @xmath0 ) dependence of the size of liquid - drop impact craters , the results remain controversial and incomplete @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> katsuragi @xcite and delon et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite reported that the diameter of liquid - drop impact craters , @xmath1 , scales as the 1/4 power of the weber number of liquid drops , which yields @xmath2 , quantitatively similar to the energy scaling for low - speed solid - sphere impact cratering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the energy balance of liquid - drop impacts is different from that of solid - sphere impacts , the energy scaling argument used for solid - sphere impact cratering can not be applied to explain the 1/4 power . instead , katsuragi argued that the power arises from the scaling of the maximal spreading diameter of the impinging drop , which coincidently follows the same 1/4 scaling with @xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , a later study by nefzaoui and skurtys showed that @xmath1 is not equal to the maximal spreading diameter and a different scaling with @xmath3 was found @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although covering a larger dynamic range of @xmath0 , nefzaoui and skurtys only investigated the scaling dependence on @xmath0 and failed to provide a full scaling for @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is still unclear what s the origin of the strange 0.18 scaling in liquid - drop impact cratering . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in addition to the diameter of impact craters , other important properties of liquid - drop impact craters such as the depth of impact craters and the shape of granular residues inside craters have not been systematically explored so far .    </S>",
    "<S> the challenges faced in the study of liquid - drop impact on granular surfaces are mainly due to the large number of relevant parameters involved in the process , the inability of existing methods for resolving the 3d structure of impact craters and the difficulty in extending the dynamic range of @xmath0 in experiments . here </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the dynamics of liquid - drop impacts on granular surfaces across the largest range of impact energy that has been probed so far , which covers more than four decades from the drop deposition regime to the drop terminal velocity regime . through a systemic study using different liquid drops and granular particles at various ambient pressures , we obtain a full dimensionless scaling for the diameter of liquid - drop impact craters . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , we find that this scaling follows the well - established schmidt - holsapple scaling rule associated with asteroid impact cratering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , by combining high - speed photography with high - precision laser profilometry , we non - intrusively measure the depth of impact craters underneath the impinging drop . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement reveals that liquid - drop impact craters and asteroid impact craters exhibit a self - similar shape in spite of their enormous length difference over seven orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> these remarkable findings inspire us to apply the physical insight developed for asteroid impact cratering to the problem of liquid - drop impact cratering . </S>",
    "<S> the insight , in combination with the concepts of liquid marble @xcite and particle jamming transition @xcite , leads to a simple coherent theoretical framework that quantitatively captures all the main features of liquid - drop imprints in granular media including the diameter and the depth of impact craters and the shape of granular residues . </S>"
