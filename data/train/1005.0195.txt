    "the description of collisional relaxation in a self - gravitating system usually rests on a fokker - planck equation in which the diffusion and braking coefficients are calculated in the local approximation , taking the finite dimension of the system into account by limiting the impact parameter of the collisions to a length of order of the system s size @xcite .",
    "although characteristic relaxation times may be somewhat overestimated by this approximation due to the neglect of collective self - gravitational effects @xcite , such a kinetic equation may provide in practice a reasonable description of the collisional relaxation of gravitationally bound systems .",
    "it nevertheless rests on assumptions which , from a principle point of view , are unsatisfactory because the motion of particles during the collision is regarded as rectilinear and uniform and the system s inhomogeneity , which is basically the reason why collisions with an infinite impact parameter do not occur , is treated by way of an ill - defined cutoff .",
    "moreover , the collective response of the system is not taken into account , since the fokker - planck collision term only considers binary collisions between naked particles .",
    "a self - gravitating medium , unlike an electrical plasma , does not respond to the presence in it of a particle by screening its interaction potential with other particles . as a result ,",
    "even distant particles effectively interact , while in electrical , globally neutral , plasmas , the effective interaction distance is limited to the debye length . in a self - gravitating system ,",
    "the distance between interacting particles is only limited by the system s inhomogeneity .",
    "the spatial structure of the system matters as well as the details of the particle orbits .",
    "the consistent inclusion of collective screening effects in a kinetic equation for electrically interacting weakly coupled particles has been one of the major theoretical achievements in plasma physics when @xcite and @xcite could derive an equation surpassing in consistency the simple fokker - planck equation @xcite .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to derive a similar equation for self - gravitating systems .",
    "the task is slightly more difficult because the screening of the electrical interaction at the , usually small , debye length allows , in electrically interacting systems , to take the homogeneous and uniform motion limits .",
    "these limits can not be taken in a self - gravitating system .",
    "we overcome this difficulty by expressing the kinetic equation in action angle space rather than in position momentum space .",
    "this is possible when the hamiltonian corresponding to the average potential @xmath0 of the system is integrable .",
    "it is nevertheless uneasy in general to toggle from one to the other space , although this is certainly possible for spherically symmetric potentials , for flat systems ( which may however be unstable ) and for special thick disk potentials .",
    "numerical methods could be used to achieve the necessary transformation @xcite . as an illustrative example",
    ", we shall give special attention to spherically symmetric potentials , expanding their kinetic equation into a system which almost entirely avoids any calculation in the position - momentum space .",
    "the system s inhomogeneity requires that solutions to the poisson equation are easily found for any inhomogeneous mass distributions .",
    "this is achieved by projecting on a biorthogonal basis of pairs of density - potential functions .",
    "many astrophysical systems which have evolved to a quasi - stationary collisionless equilibrium still keep evolving on time scales longer than the dynamical time as a result of gravitational noise induced by their own constituents or by external ones .",
    "we disregard external perturbators , which we define as unbound to the system , although , as did @xcite , these could be treated , if numerous and frequent enough , as a given , non - evolving , population providing a source of gravitational noise for other populations .",
    "loosely bound satellites or remote star populations are regarded as internal to the system .",
    "this is possible because our set of kinetic equations allows to simultaneously follow different mass populations .",
    "dwarf satellite galaxies could be regarded for example as one such mass population .",
    "globular clusters , dwarf galaxies , disk galaxies and their haloes are examples of bound systems still evolving as a result of internal noise caused by particle discreteness .",
    "such systems are the object of our study . as in any weakly coupled system ,",
    "the particles suffering collisions are dressed by the polarization clouds caused by their own influence on other particles .",
    "collisions between dressed particles have quantitatively different outcomes than collisions between naked ones @xcite .",
    "this may reflect in significant differences in calculated effective relaxation times and braking or diffusion coefficients , especially when the system , though stable , is not too far from instability @xcite .",
    "it is therefore useful to account for collective dressing when calculating such processes as secular thick disk evolution , mass segregation in galaxies or in star clusters , or the damping by dynamical friction of galactic populations on high energy orbits . for simplicity , the kinetic equations to be derived below assume that the system is stationary on a dynamical time scale .",
    "they thus can not address questions in which the distribution in angle variable matters , such as the dissolution of freshly accreted satellites , although a simple extension of the theory could .",
    "since however our equations describe the coupled evolution of all populations present in the system , they are well suited to study , for example , the simultaneous evolution by dynamical friction and diffusion of a stellar population and the population of molecular clouds off which these stars scatter .    the collective response of a self gravitating system to the presence of a perturbing body has been considered by a number of authors , analytically @xcite or numerically @xcite .",
    "sometimes , the reaction of this perturbation on the perturbing body itself is calculated , as did @xcite , who computed the drag on a large body moving in an homogeneous medium , taking the collective response of this medium into account , and @xcite , who considered the global , self - consistent , perturbation caused by a satellite or a barred structure in a spherically symmetric system and its reaction on the perturbator object by the effect of dynamical friction .",
    "the secular evolution of the system in response to such perturbations has been considered by @xcite , who considered general types of perturbations on a galaxy , and by @xcite who considered perturbations caused by the cosmological environment on dark matter haloes .",
    "this evolution is of course in principle observable in n - body simulations , which however have their own difficulties in calculating the long term evolution of such systems @xcite .",
    "a number of authors @xcite have studied the collective perturbations caused in a massive spherical galactic halo by its environment .",
    "they could calculate the response of this system by resorting to a representation of the particle s motion in action and angle variables , a method first used by @xcite .",
    "we follow them on this road .",
    "they also made good use of a basis of biorthogonal pairs of density - potential functions .",
    "@xcite first derived a kinetic equation for the collisional relaxation of a self gravitating system along these lines .",
    "his equation accounts for the self - consistent gravitational dressing of the particles , but is otherwise simplified , the geometry supposedly being that of an homogeneously filled periodic cube .",
    "the inhomogeneous nature of the system should be described more accurately , still accounting for collective gravitational dressing effects .",
    "this is specifically the aim of this paper .",
    "@xcite presented a similar approach to ours for one - dimensional systems , the constituents of which interact by a general long range force . in this paper",
    "we further elaborate in section [ secsystemcouple ] on the structural evolution of the inhomogeneous system and on the secular evolution of the orbits .",
    "the liouville equation for the n - body distribution function of a system of interacting particles can be translated into a hierearchy of equations , the bbgky hierarchy , for the reduced 1-body , 2-body , 3-body etc .. distribution functions @xcite .",
    "the equation for the 1-body distribution function also involves the 2-body distribution , the equation for the 2-body distribution involves the 3-body distribution and so on .",
    "the kinetic equation being meant to be an autonomous equation for the 1-body distribution @xmath1 , its derivation necessarily involves some approximation allowing to cut this hierarchy .",
    "this is usually done at the level of the equation of evolution of the 2-body distribution function , reducing it to a relation between the 2-body and the 1-body distribution functions .",
    "the simplified equation for the 2-body distribution @xmath2 is then solved in terms of the 1-body distribution @xmath3 and the result , once introduced in the first equation of the hierarchy , provides the desired kinetic equation for @xmath4 .",
    "plasma physics knows of two such successful approximations : rare and short range interactions , allowing to ignore 3-body collisional effects on the evolution of the 2-body distribution function , leading to the boltzmann equation @xcite and weakly coupled , collective , systems in which the 3-body correlations may be neglected and the 2-body correlations considered weak , leading to the balescu - lenard equation @xcite . the weak correlation approximation is valid when the number of particles in the effective interaction sphere , the debye sphere , is large .",
    "this approximation is also valid for self - gravitating systems with a large number @xmath5 of simultaneously interacting particles .",
    "the coupling in this case is indeed weak , the ratio of the average interaction energy to the average kinetic energy scaling as @xmath6 .",
    "this provides a solid basis for the derivation of a kinetic equation .",
    "the larger @xmath5 , the more valid the approximation is . for systems with a very large number of bodies , the resulting kinetic equation is almost exact , but for the description of strong collisions .",
    "the constituents of the system are considered to be point - like objects of different masses , which we refer to as particles .",
    "they need not all be stars , but could be other entities as well , such as molecular clouds , bound clusters , a population of satellites or lumps of dark matter in the halo of a galaxy .",
    "the kinetic equations to be derived below are valid as long as most collisions are weak , which implies that the collisional evolution time of any type of particles remains long compared to the dynamical time .",
    "we assume that the masses of the consituents come in a finite set .",
    "each mass group is labeled by a lower case latin letter .",
    "an efficient and concise notation is needed .",
    "some weakly relevant variables , such as time , will often be omitted from the list of arguments of some functions .",

    "@xmath7 is the 1-body and species average of @xmath32 : @xmath33 the gravitational potential @xmath34 from which this force derives is : @xmath35      the first equation of the bbgky hierarchy can be written : @xmath36 neglecting 3-body correlations , the second equation of the bbgky hierarchy can be written as : @xmath37 equation ( [ bbgky2 ] ) is linear in the correlation function and has on its right hand side a source term @xmath38 which is a functional of the 1-body distribution functions , namely : @xmath39 the solution for @xmath40 can be found in terms of the sources @xmath41 by working out the green s function , or propagator , of the operator on the left hand side of equation ( [ bbgky2 ] ) .",

    "the solution of equation ( [ vlasovlinpourg1 ] ) has to be found for @xmath58 only , because of causality . according to bogoliubov s synchronisation hypothesis @xcite ,",
    "the 1-body distribution functions can be regarded as constant in equations ( [ green2 ] ) and ( [ vlasovlinpourg1 ] ) because they evolve on the relaxation time scale , which is much longer than the time required for the correlation function to reach an equilibrium , given the present value of the 1-body distributions .",
    "the correlations at a given time @xmath59 then are functionals of the one particle distribution functions at this very same time .    equation ( [ vlasovlinpourg1 ] ) can be solved by means of a laplace transform with respect to the time lapse @xmath60 .",

    "strong collisions involving substancial deviation of at least one of the colliding particles are not adequately described .",
    "this inappropriate description of the rare strong collisions can be fixed by limiting the range of impact parameters to values larger than some critical limit @xmath172 which depends on the masses of the colliding species .",

    "although the limit of an homogeneous medium can not be rigourously taken for a self gravitating system , it is nevertheless possible to assume local homogeneity at the price of artificially limiting the interaction distance between particles by cutting it at some characteristic size of the system .",

    "this is the geometry considered by @xcite . due to the assumed homogeneity , the collective force @xmath191 vanishes and the unperturbed motion is rectilinear and uniform , whatever the state of relaxation of the system .",
    "the action variables are then proportional to the components of the momentum @xmath22 and the angle variables are proportional to the components of the position @xmath21 .",

    "this can be accounted for in the notation by writing this wave vector as @xmath199 , the corresponding angle wave vector being noted @xmath200 . the density function and the potential of the element @xmath111 of the basis are both proportional to @xmath201 .",
    "their normalization factor must be such that the biorthogonality relation ( [ biortho ] ) be satisfied , the density @xmath109 and the potential @xmath202 being related by equation ( [ deltaetpsi ] ) .",
    "these constraints result in : @xmath203 the @xmath204 s are the fourier transforms of @xmath110 with respect to the angles @xmath23 , namely : @xmath205 where @xmath206 is a triple kronecker symbol . in this case",
    "the @xmath207 s do not depend on the actions and remain fixed while the relaxation proceeds .",
    "the response matrix @xmath176 , calculated from its definition ( [ epsilonalphabeta ] ) , is diagonal , its element @xmath208 being given , for @xmath63 in the upper half complex plane , by : @xmath209 for real @xmath63 , a @xmath210 should be added to the singular denominator .",
    "since @xmath111 enters this relation by its wave vector @xmath211 , @xmath212 can be regarded as a function @xmath213 , or , more generally , as a function of a wave vector @xmath214 and of a frequency @xmath63 .",
    "because of the diagonality of the response matrix @xmath176 and the simplicity of equation ( [ psialphakhomograv ] ) , the writing of the kinetic equation ( [ laequation ] ) simplifies to : @xmath215 where the tensor @xmath216 is defined by : @xmath217 equations ( [ laequationhomograv])([colltensorhomograv ] ) are identical to equation ( 29 ) of @xcite when the quasi homogeneity of the system and associated absence of collective and external forces are accounted for .",
    "equation ( [ laequationhomograv ] ) can be written explicitly as a fokker - planck equation in the form : @xmath218 where the momentum drag and diffusion coefficients are : @xmath219 for electrical instead of gravitational interactions , the gravitational constant @xmath27 should be replaced by @xmath220 in mksa units , @xmath221 being the dielectric permittivity of vacuum . the electric force between like charges being repulsive instead of attractive , the minus sign before the second term of equation ( [ epsilonhomograv ] )",
    "should be changed to a positive sign and the masses replaced by the charges of the particles .",
    "equation ( [ laequationhomograv ] ) then reduces to the balescu - lenard equation for homogeneous and multispecies plasmas @xcite .",
    "it implicitly accounts for the screening effect , which is embodied in the dielectric function .",
    "the integral on wave vector space in equation ( [ colltensorhomograv ] ) then need not be cut at small wave vectors because @xmath222 diverges as @xmath223 approaches zero . for self gravitational systems the small @xmath223 limit",
    "is unphysical , due to the absence of screening .",
    "the distance between interacting particles is limited in this case by the inhomogeneity of the system , a feature which is lost in the local approximation .",
    "if one were to insist on the quasi - homogeneous approximation , the integration over wave vectors in equation ( [ colltensorhomograv ] ) would have to be artificially limited from below to some minimum modulus @xmath224 , where @xmath175 is a characteristic size of the system .",
    "little would then be gained over a more traditional fokker - planck approximation , but for the fact that equation ( [ laequationhomograv ] ) still accounts for the collective dressing of the colliding particles .",
    "when these collective effects are themselves neglected , which amounts to take @xmath225 in equation ( [ colltensorhomograv ] ) , the usual local fokker - planck equation ( [ formefp ] ) is recovered , with braking and diffusion coefficients given by expressions ( [ ahomogene ] ) and ( [ bhomogene ] ) , @xmath176 now supposedly being equal to unity . as above , the integral on wavevectors in equation ( [ colltensorhomograv ] ) should limited to a lower cutoff at @xmath226 , to account for the finite size of the system , and to an upper cutoff @xmath227 , to account for strong collisions ( section [ strongcoll ] ) .",
    "the coulomb logarithm is @xmath228 , where @xmath229 .",
    "when @xmath176 equals unity , the integration over wave vectors in equation ( [ colltensorhomograv ] ) can easily be performed .",
    "the result , which involves the relative velocity of the colliding particles @xmath230 , is : @xmath231 where @xmath232 is the unit second rank tensor .",
    "this is identical to the fokker - planck equation presented , for example , in @xcite , equations ( 8a.10 ) .",
    "the collective dressing becomes important when @xmath233 in equation ( [ colltensorhomograv ] ) largely differs from unity .",
    "as shown by @xcite , this happens when the system is not far from being unstable , for example when its size becomes of order of the jeans length , the complex zeroes of @xmath234 lying close , but below , the real axis .",
    "equation ( [ laequation ] ) satisfies an h theorem which states that the statistical entropy : @xmath235 increases with time .",
    "because the relaxing distribution functions depend on actions only , the integral over angles reduces to a mere multiplication by a factor @xmath236 , so that : @xmath237 the time derivative of @xmath238 is given by equation ( [ laequation ] ) which can be symmetrized by substituting to the first operator @xmath239 the operator @xmath240 . the contribution associated with the added operator @xmath241 vanishes on integration over @xmath161 .",
    "this can be seen by using the flux divergence theorem in action space , recognizing that the surface integral over the boundary of the physical @xmath161 domain vanishes .",
    "indeed , the expression on the right of the first operator @xmath239 in equation ( [ laequation ] ) represents , up to its sign , the flux in action space at @xmath164 caused by collisions with particles having action @xmath161 or the flux at @xmath161 caused by collisions with particles of action @xmath164 . the physical domain is limited in action space by a boundary at a finite distance and extends to infinity in certain directions .",
    "the flux through the boundary at finite distance vanishes because the action vector of no particle can evolve through this boundary from the physical to the unphysical domain .",
    "the flux at infinity vanishes because @xmath242 decreases fast enough .",
    "this justifies the above - suggested substitution .",
    "the expression of @xmath243 given by equation ( [ laequation ] ) , modified as described , when inserted in equation ( [ evolentropystat ] ) , gives the following expression for @xmath244 : @xmath245 this expression is further symmetrized by combining it with the equivalent expression obtained by exchanging species indices @xmath7 and @xmath10 , actions @xmath164 and @xmath161 and fourier variables @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "the resulting expression is then integrated by parts , using the flux divergence theorem in either @xmath164 or @xmath161 space . as explained above , the contribution of the integral on the boundary of the action domain or at infinity vanishes . we are eventually left with the positive expression : @xmath246 this establishes that the statistical entropy of the system is monotonically increasing . since the entropy of a self gravitating system of a given total mass and energy",
    "is not bounded from above @xcite , the increase of the statistical entropy does not lead , as in homogeneous gases or plasmas , to a state of thermodynamic equilibrium . when the system becomes sufficiently centrally condensed , a gravothermal instability develops @xcite .",
    "the quenching of this instability by the formation of binaries is not described by equation ( [ laequation ] ) , because the formation of binary systems results from triple collisions ( that is , from third order correlations ) and is of the strong interaction type .",
    "when the relaxation proceeds , the distribution functions @xmath247 evolve according to equations ( [ laequation ] ) . this causes a slow secular change in the average potential @xmath248 and in the response matrix @xmath249 ( equation ( [ epsilonalphabeta ] ) ) .",
    "the basis potential functions @xmath110 are time - independent , but their fourier transforms with respect to angles @xmath23 are not because they depend on the orbits of the particles , which slowly change with the potential .",
    "the fourier coefficients @xmath250 are then indirectly related to the slowly evolving potential @xmath188 .",
    "thus , equation ( [ laequation ] ) is not an autonomous equation for the distribution functions @xmath247 .",
    "the response matrix @xmath249 of equation ( [ epsilonalphabeta ] ) is a functional of those , which also depends on the angle fourier transforms @xmath251 as does the quantity @xmath157 present in equations ( [ definitiond ] ) and ( [ laequation ] ) .",
    "the kinetic equation ( [ laequation ] ) must then be completed with equations describing the evolution in time of the average potential @xmath188 and of the angle fourier coefficients @xmath252 of the basis potentials .",
    "this aspect of the system s evolution is not considered by @xcite . in this section",
    ", the time @xmath59 will be restaured , though only where necessary , in the list of arguments of functions .",
    "the potential @xmath188 derives from the mass density : @xmath253 the corresponding gravitational potential is obtained from its expansion on the biorthogonal density - potential basis by equation ( [ phiexpansiongene ] ) . from appendix [ sphericalities ] , it is found that its partial time - derivative is : @xmath254 equation ( [ variationpot ] ) , as well as equations ( [ epsilonalphabeta ] ) , ( [ definitiond ] ) and ( [ laequation ] ) , call for an equation for the time - evolution of the coefficients @xmath255 : @xmath256 an explicit expression for these coefficients when the potential is spherical is derived in appendix [ sphericalities ] , which also gives a summary of angle and action variables for a particle moving in a spherical potential . in this case , the coefficients @xmath255 vanish when the wave vector @xmath96 has non - vanishing @xmath257 or @xmath258 components .",
    "the non - vanishing coefficients depend only on the radial @xmath259 component , hereafter noted @xmath184 .",
    "for conciseness , the variables @xmath24 , which are mere parameters , are omitted wherever possible .",
    "after some calculations , we find that : @xmath260 when the potential changes , the radial distances @xmath261 and @xmath262 of the periapse and apoapse change accordingly : the bounds of the integrals in equations ( [ w+k1k2 ] ) , ( [ omegaspheriq ] ) and ( [ jspheriq ] ) are time - dependent .",
    "these integrals are singular , though convergent , the periapse and apoapse distances being the zeroes of the square root denominator : @xmath263 these zeroes are simple when the orbit is not circular and merge into a double zero when it is .",
    "this latter situation can be dealt with by a limit process , in which simple zeroes @xmath261 and @xmath262 are made to converge to eachother .",
    "we then assume that @xmath261 and @xmath262 are simple zeroes .",
    "an index @xmath264 or @xmath146 denotes the value of a function of @xmath265 at @xmath261 or @xmath262 respectively .",

    "the time derivative of @xmath290 is found to be : @xmath291 equation ( [ dotdepsialphak ] ) describes the time - evolution of the fourier coefficients @xmath292 .",
    "the auxiliary @xmath60-derivatives which enter this equation are given by equations ( [ dottauwk ] ) , ( [ dotomega1 ] ) , ( [ partialtauq ] ) , ( [ dotrpa ] ) and ( [ derq ] ) .",
    "the other quantities entering equation ( [ dotdepsialphak ] ) are expressed in terms of the potential by equations ( [ w+k1k2 ] ) , ( [ p ] ) , ( [ periapoequation ] ) and ( [ omegaspheriq ] ) .",
    "all these relations eventually link the time - evolution of @xmath293 to the time - evolution of @xmath294 , which is itself described by equation ( [ variationpot ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ laequation ] ) , ( [ variationpot ] ) and ( [ dotdepsialphak ] ) form the system of coupled equations for the distribution functions @xmath295 , the average potential @xmath294 and the angle fourier coefficients @xmath292 that we have been seeking for in this section .",
    "this system involves the auxiliary equations mentioned above , as well as equations ( [ epsilonalphabeta])([definitiond ] ) .",
    "kinetic equations for the collisional evolution of the constituents of self - gravitating inhomogeneous systems have been derived . these equations ( [ laequation ] ) surpass in consistency the usual fokker - planck equations ( [ formefp ] )    ( [ asanseffetscoll ] )    ( [ bsanseffetscoll ] ) .",
    "the latter are unsatisfactory from a principle point of view , being local and non - collective .",
    "by contrast , the proposed equations fully account for the system s inhomogeneity and for the collective gravitational dressing of the colliding particles",
    ".    equations ( [ laequation ] ) describe the evolution of distribution functions in action and angle space , which is possible when the hamiltonian associated with the average potential is integrable .",
    "physically , these equations describe the evolution of the distribution functions in action space as a result of the weak gravitational noise caused by the discreteness of the particles , dressed with the polarization clouds that their own gravity induces in the system .",
    "this gravitational polarization is accounted for in equation ( [ laequation ] ) in a manner that is fully consistent with the distribution functions , as they are at the moment .",
    "equation ( [ laequation ] ) is the sum of a second order derivative term with respect to actions and of a first order one .",
    "it therefore basically is of the fokker - planck type , although it is definitely simpler in the form of expression ( [ laequation ] ) .",
    "the diffusion coefficient involved depends on the 1-body distributions themselves , in particular through the factor @xmath296 which represents the effect of the dressing of the colliding particles by the gravitational polarization induced around them by their own influence .",
    "unlike in electrical plasmas , the polarization dressing in self - gravitational systems does not cause any screening of the interaction , which remains effective even between distant particles .",
    "the mutual distance of such particles is limited only by the finite size of the system . were the gravitational influence of particles on their surrounding to be neglected , the response matrix @xmath176 ( equation ( [ epsilonalphabeta ] ) ) would reduce to unity and the coefficients of the corresponding fokker - planck kinetic equation",
    "would simply be averages by the distribution functions of functions of velocity , as in equations ( [ asanseffetscoll ] )    ( [ bsanseffetscoll ] ) .",
    "it is apparent from the developments of appendix [ grossesmagouilles ] , which lead to equation ( [ laequation ] ) , that the @xmath96 component in angle fourier space of the gravitational polarization response given to a particle has frequency @xmath297 .",
    "this means that the polarization cloud which accompanies a particle forms a structure in angle space which vary as @xmath298 : it corotates in angle with that particle .",
    "the presence of the dirac function @xmath299 in equation ( [ laequation ] ) indicates that particles interact resonantly .",
    "this certainly is an important physical property of remote interactions , for which the components of the angle wave vectors @xmath185 and @xmath186 must be small . for closer encounters ,",
    "the modulus of these wave vectors is larger and the resonance condition @xmath300 becomes less selective , being more easily satisfied .",
    "the correlation function has been calculated on the basis of a linearized theory , which is justified by the weakness of the average interactions in this many - body system .",
    "this means that the trajectories of the particles during the collision are regarded as being the unperturbed trajectories .",
    "similarly , the gravitational polarization cloud around any one of the colliding particles is calculated as if the partner in the collision were not present : equation ( [ laequation ] ) is still a weak collision approximation .",
    "a cutoff at small impact parameters is therefore needed to account for the rare strong collisions .",
    "equation ( [ laequation ] ) takes full account of the inhomogeneity of the system , which is embodied in the dependence of the distribution functions on the actions @xmath24 s .",
    "it requires no artificial cutoff at large impact parameters .",
    "the details of the trajectories followed by the particles in the present gravitational potential are also fully accounted for , being implicit in the relations which link the angle and action variables to the position and momentum ones .",
    "these relations depend on the actual global gravitational potential of the system , which slowly evolves in time together with the distribution functions .",
    "the density - potential basis functions @xmath301 are choosen at the beginning of the calculation once and for all , but their angle fourier transforms @xmath189 , which depend on the actual trajectories of the particles , change with time because the trajectory of a particle of given actions slowly evolves with the general potential of the system as the relaxation proceeds .",
    "as long as it suffers no collision , a given particle keeps its vector @xmath73 fixed because the actions are adiabatic invariants .",
    "collisions , however , cause a secular evolution of the functions @xmath302 , which is exactly what equation ( [ laequation ] ) describes .",
    "the description of particle motions is made simple by the use of action and angle variables .",
    "their complexity is embodied in the supposedly known relation between position and momentum variables and action and angle variables .",
    "the usefulness of equation ( [ laequation ] ) is therefore limited to systems for which this relation can be established , either analytically or , possibly , numerically @xcite .    while the relaxation proceeds , the gravitational potential and the orbits of the particles evolve . as a result",
    ", the kinetic equation must be completed by evolution equations for the potential and for other relevant quantities .",
    "section [ secsystemcouple ] establishes , for spherical systems , this set of coupled equations .",
    "i am indebted to c. pichon and d. aubert for awaking my interest for this problem .",
