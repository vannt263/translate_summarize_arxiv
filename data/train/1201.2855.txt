    "the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) is one of the fundamental models of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "essentially a driven diffusion model , it has many applications in physics and beyond , including traffic models  @xcite , the movement of molecular motors in biological systems  @xcite , and protein synthesis in messenger rna ( mrna ) translation  @xcite .",
    "it also belongs to the same universality class as some surface growth models  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study a constrained tasep where finite resources are shared among several lattices . by _",
    "finite resources _ we mean a constrained number of both particles and `` fuel carriers '' , whose role is to provide the energy needed to the movement of the particles .",
    "molecular motors requiring atp or gtp molecules are an example of such systems occurring in nature . in this paper",
    "we introduce a new model which includes the finite availability of both resources , in contrast to previous works where the effect of having a finite number of a single type of resource was studied in isolation  @xcite . as a result",
    ", multiple phase transitions can occur when varying one of the fundamental parameters of the model the exit rate @xmath0 while keeping the rest of the parameters constant : the system can go from a high density regime , to a shock phase , then to a high density phase again , visit the shock phase once more , and finally reach a low density phase .",
    "this is a novel effect that emerges only by combining both limited resources .",
    "we use a mean - field approach and verify our results by means of monte carlo simulations .    in its most simple form ,",
    "the tasep consists of a 1d lattice of @xmath2 sites upon which particles can sit , see ( a ) .",
    "each site can be occupied only by one particle at a time , and particles move from site to site in one direction ( say rightward ) with a hopping rate @xmath3 .",
    "since particles can not pass each other , movement requires that the downstream site is vacant .",
    "a system with open boundaries , as we shall consider here , can display rich dynamics with multiple boundary induced phases  @xcite .",
    "particles are allowed to hop onto the lattice with rate @xmath1 at one end , and off of the lattice with rate @xmath0 at the other . for a system with constant internal hopping rate @xmath3 it is possible to solve the steady - state of the system exactly  @xcite , whilst the full relaxation dynamics have been solved using matrix methods  @xcite .",
    "mean - field methods have also been extensively used  @xcite , since they are easily tractable and yield a good approximation in many cases . there has been much extension of this simple model , for example variable hopping rates ( site or particle dependent )  @xcite , extended particles which cover more than one site  @xcite , branching lattices  @xcite , particles which have multiple internal states  @xcite , as well as a tasep with a constrained reservoir of particles  @xcite .    ,",
    "hop at fixed rate @xmath3 and leave with rate @xmath0 .",
    "( b ) a finite number of fuel carriers can be introduced .",
    "when a particle hops , fuel from one carrier is used .",
    "( c ) complete model with finite fuel carrier and finite particles .",
    "the entry rate depends on the number of particles in the reservoir , and the hopping rate depends on the number of loaded fuel carriers .",
    "[ diagram ] ]    for the standard tasep we denote the occupation of the @xmath4th lattice site @xmath5 if the site contains a particle and @xmath6 otherwise .",
    "the system is characterised by the steady - state particle current @xmath7 ( the rate at which particles pass any given point on the lattice ) , and the mean site occupancy ( often called density ) @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes average over realisations of the system ( which we assume is ergodic , so this is equivalent to a time average ) .",
    "the average density is therefore given by @xmath10 .",
    "there are four possible phases depending on the values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 : the entry limited or low density ( ld ) phase , the exit limited or high density ( hd ) phase , a maximal current ( mc ) phase where the current depends only on the internal hopping rate , and a mixed ld - hd or shock phase ( sp ) .",
    "a mean - field approach @xcite ( which turns out to be exact in the @xmath11 limit ) can be used to calculate @xmath7 and @xmath12 for given @xmath1 and @xmath0 . the density in the bulk ( far from the ends of the system ) is given by @xmath13 and the current is always given by @xmath14 .",
    "the sp , which occurs for @xmath15 , presents an hd region on the right of the lattice and an ld region on the left , separated by a boundary which diffuses freely through the lattice .",
    "this has often been described using a domain wall ( dw ) theory @xcite . due to the free diffusion of the dw a time average of the density in sp",
    "gives @xmath16 , but the current depends on the density in the ld and hd regions of the lattice , i.e. @xmath17 .    in this paper we consider several taseps which share a common finite pool of both particles and fuel carriers .",
    "the entry rate , which is the same for each tasep , depends on the availability of particles in a common pool ( i.e. , particles which are not involved with any lattice ) .",
    "a model describing several taseps sharing a common pool of particles has been introduced and thoroughly studied in  @xcite , where the authors use the dw theory along with known exact results . in this paper",
    "we use an alternative recent mean - field ( mf ) approach that allows us to simplify the calculations  @xcite .",
    "importantly , we combine this with a model for a finite pool of fuel carriers  @xcite which , as noted above , can be viewed as carriers that provide the energy which drives the motion , i.e. allowing the particles to hop .",
    "although we consider a fixed number of fuel carriers , we suppose that it takes a finite time to `` refuel '' them with their cargo once it has been used ( figure [ diagram](b ) shows a schematic representation of this model ) .",
    "we show that novel effects arise when both types of limited resource are considered , e.g. multiple phase transitions can occur when varying the exit rate @xmath0 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in we summarise the previous results for the two models separately , before describing in a mean - field model for a system with both a finite pool of particles _ and _ fuel carriers which are refuelled at a finite rate ( figure [ diagram](c ) ) .",
    "we then interpret the mean - field model results and compare them with results from monte carlo simulations . finally , in we analyse the effect of both limited resources on the fluctuations in the number of particles on the lattice .",
    "we first introduce and describe a system containing multiple taseps in which each lattice shares the same reservoir of particles ; then we present the concept of fuel - carriers and the effect of a finite rate of refuelling on the exclusion process dynamics .      in this work we analyse a system of @xmath18 identical lattices of length @xmath2 .",
    "the total number of available particles is @xmath19 , while the number of free particles in the reservoir is @xmath20 .",
    "since the lattices are identical and experience the same injection and depletion rates , we observe the same phase for each .",
    "we can write the total number of particles as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the density on each lattice .",
    "the entry rate of the @xmath18 lattices depends on the number of free particles via a saturating function @xmath23 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\alpha_0 \\tanh \\left [ \\frac{n - lm\\rho}{n^ * } \\right],\\label{eq::injection_rate}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the constant @xmath24 gives the entry rate in the limit @xmath25 and is an intrinsic property of the lattices  ) is consistent with the function used in @xcite , and is relevant , e.g. for the application to protein synthesis . ] . without loss of generality",
    ", we fix the normalisation factor @xmath26 to be @xmath27 , i.e. the total number of particles used if all the lattices were in the mc phase .    throughout this paper",
    "we define the different phases according to the values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 and the resulting density @xmath22 , following  @xcite . with this choice of nomenclature",
    "we solve equations for @xmath1 in terms of @xmath24 and @xmath19 .",
    "since the densities in each phase are the same as those in the standard tasep ( equations ) , for a given set of parameters ( @xmath24 , @xmath0 , @xmath19 ) we find the resulting @xmath1 which determines the phase ; e.g. if @xmath28 and @xmath29 the system will be in the ld phase . by substituting equation ( [ eq::injection_rate ] ) into these inequalities ,",
    "we get a representation of the different phases on the @xmath30 plane .    as a consequence of having a finite number of particles , we encounter different regimes for small , mid - range and large values of @xmath19 .",
    "we show typical phase diagrams for these regimes in .",
    "if @xmath31 , then the hd and mc phases no longer exist  there are too few particles to support the high density or maximal current phases .",
    "instead , there are only two phases : the ld phase and the sp ( figure [ fig : fponlyphase](a ) ) .",
    "as described in the previous section , the latter occurs when the entry and exit rates are equal , i.e. , @xmath32 , and there is coexistence between an ld region and an hd region ; since @xmath1 depends on both @xmath24 and @xmath0 ( through its dependence on the bulk density ) , the line opens into a region on the @xmath24-@xmath0 phase plane .",
    "that is to say , the condition @xmath32 is fulfilled for a certain range of @xmath24 @xcite . if @xmath33 , then the lattices can support an mc phase , and for @xmath34 there are enough particles for an hd phase to exist ( figure [ fig : fponlyphase](b ) ) .",
    "as @xmath19 is increased , the size of the hd phase on the @xmath24-@xmath0 plane increases , at the cost of reducing the size of the sp phase ( figure [ fig : fponlyphase](c ) ) . for @xmath35 the sp phase reduces to a line and we recover the original unconstrained tasep .    in the unconstrained tasep within the sp , the ld and hd regions of the system are separated by a domain wall ( dw ) which can diffuse freely across the lattice .",
    "however , if there is a finite number of particles , in the case of a single lattice the dw is pinned to one position  @xcite ( actually the dw fluctuates about its mean position like a noisy damped oscillator ) .",
    "this is because if the dw were to move to the right this would increase the number of free particles , increasing the entry rate and therefore driving the dw leftwards .",
    "similarly if the dw moves to the left the number of free particles decreases , decreasing the entry rate and driving the dw rightwards .",
    "the opening of the sp line into a region on the @xmath24-@xmath0 plane is possible because a different mean position for the dw corresponds to a different value of @xmath24 , while keeping @xmath32 .",
    "hence , the system can maintain @xmath32 for different values of @xmath24 .",
    "as detailed in @xcite , if more than one tasep is in contact with the same pool of particles , the dw on each lattice once again performs a random walk ; there is however a pinning of the total number of particles on all lattices .     with a finite number of ( a ) @xmath36 , ( b ) @xmath37 , and ( c ) @xmath38 particles ( infinite amount of loaded fuel carriers ) .",
    "for small @xmath19 there are not enough particles to support the hd and mc phases , and the sp ( coexistence ) line opens into a region . for @xmath34",
    "all four phases can be obtained .",
    "if @xmath19 is increased further the hd phase grows at the expense of a shrinking sp .",
    "[ fig : fponlyphase ] ]      in many of the systems that can be described by a driven lattice gas , the energy required for the advancement of the particles is obtained from some kind of finite resource .",
    "for instance , molecular motors consume atp molecules , and ribosome movement on mrnas during protein synthesis requires aminoacylated trna complexes and gtp .",
    "the latter case has recently been described in @xcite , and here we briefly review those results , before in the next section combining this with the a finite pool of particles model .",
    "we consider a finite number @xmath39 of fuel carriers , @xmath40 of which are carrying fuel . every time a particle moves , the fuel from one of the loaded carriers is used , and",
    "hence , @xmath40 is reduced by one .",
    "the hopping rate of particles depends on the availability of loaded fuel carriers , and the empty carriers are refuelled at a rate @xmath41 . for simplicity",
    ", the hopping rate is taken to be directly proportional to the loaded fuel carriers , i.e. @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a constant .",
    "moreover , the rate of refuelling is taken to depend on the number @xmath44 of unloaded fuel carriers as @xmath45 which has the form of the well known michaelis - menten equation in biochemistry .",
    "the recharging rate is therefore a saturating function of the number of empty carriers ( @xmath46 ) with maximum value @xmath47 and saturation determined by the constant @xmath48 .",
    "any saturating function will give the same qualitative results , but the above formulation allows for a straightforward analytical treatment  @xcite  , and then have a constant refuelling rate .",
    "this would give qualitatively similar behaviour to the present definitions .",
    "our choice is most applicable to protein synthesis , i.e. refuelling due to an enzymatic reaction . ] .    in this section",
    "we describe a collection of @xmath18 identical taseps with a finite number of fuel carriers ( but no constraints on the number of particles ) ; following the common mean - field treatment  @xcite the particle density on the @xmath4th site of each lattice is given by @xmath49 the inclusion of a finite pool of fuel carriers leads to the additional equation @xmath50 where the sum is over all of the @xmath51 sites which use fuel carriers on each of the @xmath18 lattices .",
    "we assume that the particles do not require a fuel carrier to leave the @xmath2th site , i.e. the exit rate @xmath0 is constant . in the steady - state",
    "we identify the term under the sum in as the particle current , and using equation we find @xmath52 i.e. , the hopping rate is now itself a function of the current .",
    "following @xcite , upon solving equations in the steady - state we find the four phases as in the original tasep , but now the current and density are given as follows @xmath53 where @xmath54\\ ; , \\label{eq : jcal } \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\fl \\mathcal{d}(\\alpha)=\\frac{1}{2\\alpha } \\left [ \\alpha\\left(1+\\frac{\\alpha}{a(\\bar{t}+b)}\\right ) - \\frac{\\bar{t}}{\\bar{t}+b}\\frac{v_0}{l'm } \\right .",

    "the behaviour of these functions as @xmath1 and @xmath0 are varied depends on the parameters @xmath43 , @xmath48 and @xmath57 . by considering the steady - state of equation ( [ dtdt ] ) and noticing that the maximal value that the recharging rate can possibly have is equal to @xmath47",
    ", we note that the particle current is limited from above by @xmath57 .",
    "hence , there are substantially two different cases : ( i ) if @xmath58 , the recharging rate is very fast and the particle current is not influenced by it ; we recover the results of the original tasep ; ( ii ) if in contrast @xmath59 , the recharging of the fuel carriers can limit the value of the particle current . shows the current for sets of parameters corresponding to each case . in case ( ii ) ( figure [ fig : calj](b ) ) , @xmath60 shows a sharp change from increasing with @xmath1 , to almost independent of @xmath1 ( though we note that the derivative of @xmath60 remains continuous ) .",
    "the value of @xmath60 is severely reduced compared to the one obtained for case ( i ) ( see figure [ fig : calj](a ) ) .",
    "we refer to the regime where the current appears independent of @xmath1 as a limited resources ( lr ) regime , since the rate at which fuel is used by the particles approaches the rate at which fuel carriers are reloaded .",
    "thus the pool of loaded carriers becomes depleted and the hopping rate @xmath3 reduces . for some choices of @xmath43 and @xmath48 , the lr regime exists within each of the phases ( ld , hd and mc ) . in the lr regime within the ld phase , the sensitivity of the current to changes in @xmath1 or @xmath0",
    "is greatly reduced , whilst the sensitivity of the density is greatly increased . in the mc phase , the current",
    "is greatly reduced in the lr regime compared to that in case ( i ) .",
    "for further details see  @xcite .     for different parameters . in ( a ) @xmath61 , and in ( b ) @xmath62 .",
    "in both cases @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "solid lines show the current in the ld phase , @xmath66 , and dashed lines the current in the mc phase , @xmath67 .",
    "the dotted line is at @xmath68 , where there is a transition from ld@xmath69mc .",
    "the dot - dashed line in ( b ) shows the value of @xmath70 as estimated in equation ( [ alphalr ] ) .",
    "[ fig : calj ] ]    the onset of the lr regime depends particularly on the value of the three quantities @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , the former two controlling at what value of @xmath1 or @xmath0 the onset will occur , and the latter controlling the sharpness of the change in behaviour . in the rest of this paper",
    "we choose @xmath48 such that there is a sharp onset of lr , and take @xmath47 as the control parameter for the fuel carriers , fixing the other parameters .",
    "this choice not only gives the most interesting dynamics , but it has also been shown to be the biological relevant regime in the context of protein synthesis  @xcite . when the onset of lr is sharp we can estimate the value of @xmath1 or @xmath0 at which this occurs by equating the rate of fuel carrier use ( approximately @xmath74 for small @xmath1 in ld and @xmath75 for small @xmath0 in hd ) and the maximum recharging rate .",
    "this gives @xmath76 this value is represented in figure [ fig : calj](b ) by a dot - dashed vertical line .",
    "as it is shown there , the estimation predicts quite accurately the onset of the lr regime .",
    "a much more realistic model for natural processes such as biological transport has to include the finite availability of both particles and fuel carriers .",
    "as we show later in this section , it is only when combining the two schemes discussed above that we can see emerging novel effects , such as multiple phase transitions .",
    "analogous to the dependence of the entry rate @xmath1 on the number of particles @xmath19 , the steady - state proportion of loaded fuel carriers is a saturating function of @xmath47 ( see ) .",
    "therefore , by regarding @xmath19 and @xmath47 as control parameters , we can vary the number of available particles and _ loaded _ carriers respectively ; in both cases a saturating function of the resource determines the dynamics .     as a function of rate @xmath47 for a model with no constraints on the number of particles ( ) .",
    "other parameters are @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath65 , and @xmath64 . for small @xmath47 the number of loaded fuel carriers is depleted ; for large @xmath47 the carriers are practically always fully loaded , and we recover the original unconstrained tasep . [",
    "fig : v0 ] ]    the quantities of interest are the particle current @xmath7 , the number of loaded fuel carriers @xmath40 and the particle density @xmath22 , which is linked to the number of free particles by equation . the expressions for @xmath7 and @xmath22 given in equations ( [ eq : mfsol ] ) still hold ; however @xmath1 is no longer a control parameter , and it can be eliminated using equation .",
    "this is the case in all phases except in the sp : since the dw can not move freely on the lattice , the mean density now depends on the size of the ld and hd regions .",
    "we calculate the average value @xmath81 using equation ( [ eq::injection_rate ] ) ; using the fact that in this phase @xmath32 leads to @xmath82 the hopping rate @xmath3 ( and therefore @xmath40 ) in each phase can be found by substituting the appropriate equation for the current @xmath7 in .",
    "we now turn to the problem of finding the boundaries between the different phases as functions of @xmath24 , @xmath0 , @xmath19 and @xmath47  i.e. , eliminating @xmath1 .",
    "our aim is to draw the @xmath83 phase plane for any given values of @xmath47 and @xmath19 .",
    "as noted in previous sections , due to finite particles , the sp line opens into a region , and the hd and mc phases do not exist if @xmath31 . each phase boundary can be written in terms of either @xmath24 as a function of @xmath0 , or vice versa .",
    "we now consider the boundaries between each phase in turn , consulting as an ansatz for the arrangement of the phases .    _",
    "( i ) mc / ld phase boundary .",
    "_ the mc phase can exist if @xmath34 .",
    "if we consider starting in the mc phase with large @xmath0 and reducing @xmath24 , we will cross into the ld phase when @xmath84 . using this",

    "using equation in the latter inequality gives @xmath91 ; using equation and the density in hd phase gives the following equation for the boundary @xmath92 hence , the hd / sp phase boundary is a curved line on the @xmath83 phase plane .    _",
    "( iv ) ld / sp phase boundary .",
    "_ finally we consider starting in the ld phase and moving to the sp . in ld",
    "we require @xmath28 and @xmath93 .",
    "finding an expression for these inequalities poses some difficulty , since by using equation and the density in the ld phase we obtain @xmath94 an equation which can not be solved analytically to find @xmath1 as a function of @xmath24 .",
    "instead we solve this numerically , setting @xmath32 ( which occurs at the sp ) to find @xmath0 as a function of @xmath24 .",
    "this gives another curved line on the @xmath83 phase plane .",
    "we can then construct the phase plane by plotting the phase boundaries ( @xmath0 as a function of @xmath24 ) for any given values of @xmath19 and @xmath47 .",
    "unless otherwise stated , throughout the rest of this paper we use parameters @xmath64 so that @xmath95 and hence , it is always the refuelling which is the limiting process , and not the total number of fuel carriers .",
    "this represents realistic scenarios in biological transport processes , such as protein synthesis .",
    "we set the time scale of the system by choosing @xmath80 , such that the maximum hopping rate is @xmath96 .",
    "a value of @xmath65 then gives a sharp onset of lr as shown in ( b ) .",

    "the event which occurs is chosen stochastically from the set of particles which have a vacancy to their right and the set of empty fuel carriers .",
    "particles are chosen with a probability such that they move with a rate @xmath3 , and empty fuel carriers are chosen with a probability such that they are recharged with rate @xmath41 ; after each event @xmath40 is updated accordingly . to remove any transient effects associated with the initial condition we disregard the first @xmath97 time steps .",
    "assuming that the system is ergodic we average currents and densities over at least a further @xmath98 steps .        in",
    "we present a series of phase planes for different values of @xmath19 and @xmath47 .",

    "here we show data for @xmath99 lattices , but the plots look the same for @xmath100 with appropriately scaled parameters . introducing more lattices does not change the macroscopic behaviour , but changes the microscopic behaviour for the sp ( see ) .    in",
    "we note that for small @xmath47 the phase diagrams look broadly similar to the large @xmath47 case , but as we expect from  @xcite , the phase transitions occur at much smaller values of @xmath24 and @xmath0 .",
    "we also obtain a limited resources ( lr ) regime within each of the phases .",
    "this can seen in figure [ fig : phase2 ] , which shows colour plots for the proportion of charged fuel carriers ( @xmath101 ) for different values of @xmath19 , with small @xmath47 .",
    "the onset of the lr regime can be clearly seen as @xmath101 decreases dramatically over a small range of @xmath24 or @xmath0 . for large @xmath47",
    "the refuelling is so quick that @xmath101 is constant through all phases , i.e. we recover the results for a tasep with a finite pool of particles , but no constraints on the fuel carriers , since these are refuelled almost as soon as they are used ( data not shown ) . for clarity",
    ", throughout the rest of the paper when we refer to lr or limited resources , we specifically mean the regime where the pool of loaded fuel carriers has become depleted .",
    "crucially , the presence of the lr regime also alters the shape of the phase boundaries ; a noticeable `` kink '' can be seen in the ld / sp and hd / sp phase boundaries at the point of lr onset .",
    "particularly striking is the shape of the hd / sp boundary for the large @xmath19 small @xmath47 case , and we examine this in detail in .     at different values of @xmath24 and @xmath0 for small @xmath62 .",

    "fig : phase2 ] ]      as noted above , due to the finite number of particles , the coexistence line present in the original tasep  the shock phase  opens out into a region on the phase plane .",
    "we examine the behaviour in this phase by locating the domain wall ( dw ) which separates the regions of ld and hd , and examining how the position of this is affected by the finite number of fuel carriers and how it changes at different values of @xmath24 and @xmath0 .",
    "the introduction of a finite number of particles also gives a change from a dw which can wander freely along the lattice , to one where the wandering is constrained by the presence of the reservoir .",
    "this is most easily explained in the case of @xmath99 lattices , where the dw is on average fixed in position . a fluctuation which leads to movement of the dw away from its mean",
    "position will change the number of particles in the reservoir ; this in turn changes the entry rate @xmath1 , acting like a restoring force on the dw .",
    "in actual fact the dw executes gaussian fluctuations about its mean value , and we discuss fluctuations further in . if multiple lattice are introduced ( @xmath100 ) , then as in @xcite the dw is not pinned , but rather it is the sum of the dw position on all lattices which executes gaussian fluctuations about a mean .",
    "we focus on the @xmath99 case for the rest of this section .",

    "the difficulty arises in the fact that this can also occur near the edges of the system when it is not in the sp .",

    "can be found via a continuum description , with fluctuations travelling through the lattice with a velocity @xmath138 and an effective diffusion coefficient @xmath139  @xcite . at low frequencies ( @xmath140 )",
    "the power spectrum shows oscillations , or dips in power , at unit multiple of @xmath141 , i.e. , at frequencies corresponding to the length of time it takes a fluctuation to traverse the entire lattice .",
    "these oscillations are damped for @xmath142 , after which @xmath143 ; for large frequencies @xmath144 .",
    "for the case of finite re - fuelling , but no particle constraints ( i.e. the @xmath145 limit ) , we obtain a similar power spectrum .",

    "this is because the hopping rate @xmath3 is highly reduced in the lr regime , meaning that @xmath138 is reduced , and hence , the damping occurs at much lower frequencies .",

    "this is due to the feedback effect of the particle pool which stabilises the density ( an increase in density leads to a decrease in entry rate ) .",
    "the effect is reduced for higher frequencies , as these correspond to short time scales over which the feedback from the particle pool has less influence , i.e. for time scales shorter than the time it takes a fluctuation to traverse the entire lattice . turning to the present model with constrained particles _ and _ fuel carriers , shows power spectra for systems with different total numbers of particles , both when there are no limited fuel resources ( ( a ) ) and when there are ( ( b ) ) .",
    "note that to fairly compare fluctuations from two simulations the mean densities and hopping rates ( and therefore positions of the `` dips '' in the power spectrum ) must be the same ; we therefore choose different values of @xmath24 to give the same value of @xmath138 in each case .",

    "the value of @xmath160 is chosen short enough so as to probe the movement of the dw on mesoscopic time scales rather than probing only the mean - field density profile . following the approach of @xcite we choose for @xmath160 the smallest value which gives exactly one micro - domain wall ( @xmath161dw ) in the averaged profile . a @xmath161dw",

    "also shown is the mean over the mesoscopic time @xmath160 , i.e. a snapshot of the density profile from which the `` instantaneous '' dw position can be found .",
    "we note that in the lr regime ( ( b ) ) there are larger fluctuations in the @xmath160 averaged profile than for non - lr , and shape of the dw in the long time average profile is wider .",
    "the @xmath160 averaging method works well for small values of @xmath0 ; however for larger @xmath0 when the system is in the lr regime , determination of the position of the shock is much more difficult .",
    "this is because , due to the limited availability of the fuel carriers , the particles move more slowly ",
    "the density fluctuations in the regions to the left and right of the dw exist on time scales similar to that of the movement of the wall .",
    "any value of @xmath160 which will average out the microscopic fluctuations , will also average out the movement of the wall .",
    "this problem is compounded by the fact that the difference between the mean density on either side of the dw decreases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "therefore we can only accurately measure the time course of the dw position just inside the lr regime ; deep within that regime , we can only measure the mean wall position .",
    "figures [ fig : spmeanx](c)-(d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) show respectively typical time courses , normalised histograms of the wall positions , and the correlation function of the time course defined as @xmath162 where @xmath163 , and @xmath164 denotes average over time .",
    "the correlation functions are approximately exponential , and the examples shown have correlation time @xmath165 ( @xmath166 ) and @xmath167 ( @xmath168 - the lr regime ) .",
    "we find that whilst the time scale over which the dw moves is comparable in both cases , the width of the distribution is much wider in the lr case .    for the sp , previous studies @xcite have treated density fluctuations analytically by making the approximation that any fluctuations travel quickly along the lattice and are absorbed by the dw .",
    "that is to say , any fluctuation can be treated as a movement of the dw , and so only fluctuations in the rate at which particles move onto the @xmath169 and off of the @xmath170 sites need be considered .",
    "the fluctuations can then be described using a simple langevin equation , leading to a power spectra @xmath171 , where the constant @xmath172 represents the restoring force which localises the dw .     and values of @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "the onset of the lr regime is at @xmath175 , so the top 2 curves are for systems with lr .",
    "other parameters are @xmath77 , @xmath62 and @xmath103 . the dashed line shows the slope @xmath152.[fig : spflucts ] ]    shows that prediction of @xmath143 for large @xmath147 still holds in the system with constrained fuel carriers .",
    "however , the value of @xmath172 given by the theory does not correctly predict the behaviour at small @xmath147 for the lr regime . as noted above ( and as can be seen by the increasing values of @xmath176 with increasing @xmath0 in figure [ fig : spflucts ] ) the fluctuations in the density increase significantly in the lr regime .",
    "these fluctuations are not quickly absorbed by movement of the front , but rather spend considerable time in other regions of the lattice ; thus a theoretical treatment of fluctuations in a system with lr would require consideration of fluctuations in the hopping of particles at all sites , and is beyond the scope of the current work .",
    "the slow movement of the fluctuations along the lattice becomes particularly evident if we look at a snapshot of the density profile for a system deep within the lr regime ( ) ; here the front seen in the time averaged profile is almost completely obscured by the fluctuations .    in summary , we find that in the lr regime within the sp density fluctuations move more slowly through the lattice .",
