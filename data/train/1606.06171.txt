    ", however , the resistivity levels off below @xmath2675k and stays constant until superconductivity sets in .",
    "such behavior of resistivity in p015 is reminiscent of resistivity in strongly underdoped eufe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 , where the spin - density - wave ( sdw ) ordering of the fe@xmath4 moments is responsible for the leveling off the @xmath27 curve @xcite . according to ref .",

    "@xcite we can not identify any discontinuity in the resistivity of p015 , that could be assigned to a sdw transition .    as one can see from the panels ( a - c ) of fig .",

    "this re - entrant resistivity is a well - known phenomenon for eu - based 122 iron pnictides ; it stems from ordering of the eu@xmath4 moments at @xmath32k , which has no significant doping dependence for underdoped and superconducting samples @xcite .",
    "the p021 sample exhibits the highest @xmath33 and reaches zero resistance at @xmath34 25k , i.e. well above the eu - ordering temperature .",

    "it has been shown , that the feature at @xmath35 can be assigned to the magnetic ordering of the eu@xmath4 moments with strong ferromagnetic component out of plane @xcite .",

    "furthermore , it was demonstrated recently that p0165 exhibits a strong diamagnetic signal in the measurements of the in - plane _ dynamic _ magnetic susceptibility with a large constant magnetic field applied to suppress the ordering of the eu@xmath4 moments @xcite .",
    "panels ( a - c ) of fig .  [ fig : ref - sig ] display the normal - state in - plane reflectivity of the investigated samples .",
    "all three compounds demonstrate a qualitatively similar temperature evolution of @xmath10 .",
    "the reflectivity in the fir range increases with lowering temperature , indicating the metallic nature of our samples .",
    "oppositely , the reflectivity at mir frequencies ( @xmath37 @xmath15 ) decreases as temperature goes down .",
    "this behavior is usually ascribed to electron correlations arising from the hunds - rule coupling of electrons @xcite .",
    "for all three crystals , there is a narrow region of frequencies ( around @xmath38@xmath15 ) where @xmath10 is nearly temperature independent .",
    "apart from these common features , there is one important difference between the reflectivity spectra of the samples : while the fir reflectivity is monotonic in frequency at any temperature for p021 , the @xmath10 curves of the two other samples exhibit a non - monotonic frequency behavior at @xmath39 k for p0165 and at @xmath40 for p015 .",
    "the real part of the optical conductivity , @xmath41 , obtained via the kramers - kronig transformation , is shown in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : ref - sig ] . the non - monotonic fir reflectivity in p015 and",
    "p0165 manifest itself in @xmath42 as very broad modes dominating the fir conductivity .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : ref - sig ] , the development of the fir mode has no systematic doping dependence .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the appearance of the modes is a sample - related issue . in case of p015",
    "we can speculate wether the fir anomaly below @xmath43k is due to a possible sdw transition discussed for this sample in the previous section .",
    "however , comparing the @xmath42 spectra to previous optical studies on electron or hole underdoped bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 that clearly show a sdw transition , we notice that below t@xmath44 a common feature is a pile up of spectral weight ( sw ) at approximately @xmath45 @xmath15 while at lower frequencies the spectra get suppressed , irrespective of doping type or level @xcite .",
    "hence , the mismatch in energy scale of our fir feature together with the absence of any sharp feature in the resistivity in fig .",
    "[ fig : res - mag ] ( a ) enables us to conclude , that this fir peculiarity in p015 is not related to a sdw ordering . in case of the p0165 sample ,",
    "the same argument holds .",
    "we want to point out that the observation of similar modes in the fir in iron pnictides is by far not exceptional .",
    "there are reports of fir modes in hole - doped @xcite , and electron - doped ba-@xmath46 @xcite , even in the parent compound @xcite .",
    "for all these reports we can not see a systematic doping level dependence and there are also reports where any comparable feature is absent ( e.g. ref.s @xcite ) . even though the interpretation of these modes range from pseudogap to low lying interband transitions , we find , that due to the non - systematic appearance , localization of itinerant carriers induced by impurities @xcite is the most probable origin of the modes , as already suggested in refs .",
    ".    typical metallic behavior of the optical conductivity , i.e. a monotonic narrowing of the zero - frequency - centered drude - like mode with decreasing temperature , is clearly visible only for sample p021 . in p0165 and p015 ,",
    "the temperature development of the drude response is perturbed by the localization modes .",
    "nevertheless , the zero - frequency limit of the optical conductivity , @xmath47 , nicely follows the dc data for all the samples at any temperature , as it can be seen from the inserts of figs .",
    "[ fig : res - mag ] ( a - c ) .",
    "we now calculate the frequency - dependent spectral weight defined as : @xmath48 for temperatures in the normal state , the spectral weight normalized to the spectral weight at @xmath49k is displayed in the insets of figs .",
    "[ fig : ref - sig ] ( d - f ) .",
    "the general trends of the spectral - weight behavior are the same for all three samples , although the localization modes affect the normalized spectral weight at low frequencies , where it stays above 1 and is maximal at the lowest temperatures . in the mir range , the temperature - dependent spectral weight is below its room - temperature values ; the lower the temperature , the more pronounced the losses are . after passing a minimum at @xmath50@xmath15 , the normalized spectral weight increases again . only at frequencies above @xmath51@xmath15 the spectral weight becomes eventually conserved ( within an uncertainty of @xmath52% ) for all the samples .",
    "the presence of the spectral - weight transfer up to such high energies is an important feature of iron pnictides and is ascribed to correlation effects , e.g. to the hund s rule correlations mentioned above @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "the members of the eu-122 family , investigated in this work , behave very similarly to many other pnictides .        in order to get insight in the mechanisms contributing to the frequency - dependent optical response",
    ", one needs to decompose the measured spectra into a number of simple terms .",
    "we fitted our experimental spectra in a standard way  by a sum of drude and lorentz terms .",
    "for the complex optical conductivity , the model reads as @xcite : @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the plasma frequency of each term , @xmath55 is the resonance frequency of each lorentz term , and @xmath56 denotes the scattering rates of free carriers in the case of drude terms and introduces a damping for each lorentz oscillator .    because of the multiband nature of iron pnictides , there are many ways to decompose their optical spectra , as it has been already discussed e.g. in ref .",
    "we use a model that captures all major spectral features , but still keeps the number of free parameters as small as possible .",
    "it has been shown that a drude - lorentz model with two drude components provides an adequate description for the optical response of many iron pnictides @xcite .",
    "for the 122 family , it is well established , that one of the two drude components is rather broad in frequency ( large @xmath56 ) and the other one is quite narrow ( small @xmath56 ) .",
    "sometimes , the broad component is replaced by an overdamped lorentzian .",
    "the broad term is usually associated with the hole pockets of the fermi surface , while the narrow drude component is normally assigned to the electron pockets @xcite .",
    "this assignment is based on the differences in scattering rates of the two carrier types found in pnictides by hall measurements : holes posses a rather large @xmath56 , while electrons scatter much less frequently , i.e. their @xmath56 is smaller @xcite .",
    "thereafter , we abbreviate the broad and the narrow drude components as bd and nd , respectively . the fit parameters of the drude components for the lowest normal - state temperatures of all three samples are given in table  [ table ] .",
    "in addition to the two drude terms , a number of lorentzians are necessary to fit the experimental spectra properly .",
    "we use a broad lorentzian ( mirl ) to describe the flat mir background , which was previously reported in a number of 122 compounds and which is believed to be due to an interband - transition band located at around @xmath45@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "another lorentz term , marked as  hund \" , is used to fit a pronounced broad interband - transition band located around @xmath57@xmath15 .",
    "both bands display a strong temperature dependence , which is believed to stem from a strong renormalization by hunds - rule coupling effects @xcite .",
    "additionally , we need to use a few temperature - independent modes at higher frequencies .",
    "let us note , that the optical conductivity was fitted together with the measured reflectivity in order to provide the most consistent description of the experimental spectra .    for sample p021 ,",
    "the described model is sufficient for an adequate description of the experiment [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : fit ] ( c ) ] .",
    "for the two other samples , we had to introduce more terms to describe the localization bands . in the case of sample p015 , one additional lorentzian ( loc ) in the fir range was sufficient [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] ( a ) ] . for p0165",
    ", we had to introduce two lorentzians ( loc and loc2 ) and to omit the bd term at all temperatures [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] ( b ) ] , as otherwise no reasonable description was possible @xcite .",
    "this indicates that localization effects are particularly strong in p0165 .",
    "we now discuss the temperature changes in the single terms of eqn .",
    "[ eq : dru - lor ] .",
    "first , we discuss the scattering rates @xmath56 of the drude terms shown in the middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] . in p021 , the scattering rate of both , broad and narrow , drude terms is linear in temperature .",
    "the same behavior is visible in the only ( narrow ) drude component of p0165 .",
    "this observation together with the @xmath58-linear resistivity provides a strong evidence for non - fermi - liquid behavior which might be caused by strong magnetic fluctuations around a possible qcp beneath the superconducting dome .",
    "indications for such qcp have been observed by other experimental methods @xcite . also , a similar @xmath58-linear scattering rate has been reported in hole and electron doped ba - based pnictides of the 122 family @xcite , yet only for the nd component .",
    "the reason for the fact that we also observe @xmath58-linear scattering for the bd component possibly is related to the difference in substitution method .",
    "hence , it would be interesting to compare our finding to an equivalent study on bafe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0",
    ". however , to our knowledge there is to date no temperature dependent optical investigation on p - substituted ba-122 that utilizes the drude - lorentz model to decompose the spectra .    in sample p015 , the @xmath58-linear scattering rate at @xmath59 k",
    "is only observed for the bd component , while @xmath56 of the nd component is not linear at @xmath60k . at @xmath61k ,",
    "the localization mode ( loc ) appears in the conductivity spectra and obviously affects the temperature behavior of the nd scattering rate : @xmath56 of the nd term collapses , implying that the carriers scatter less .",
    "the resistivity of this sample shows a flattening at low temperatures , as seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : res - mag ] ( a ) . since @xmath62 with @xmath63 being the carrier density , and",
    "since the bd scattering rate is linear in temperature , the simultaneous flattening of the @xmath64 curve and collapsing @xmath56 of the nd term can not be consistently understood , if @xmath63 remains constant .",
    "however , in our case @xmath63 is not constant , because some electrons get localized . as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] ( h ) , the sum of the spectral weights of the nd and loc terms remains basically constant as a function of temperature .",
    "the spectral weight and therefore the number of carriers contributing to the bd term are also temperature independent .",
    "thus , it is evident that only the carriers from the nd term are affected by the localization effects .",
    "it is likely that the remaining free carriers of the nd term scatter less because the contribution of the electron - electron interactions to the scattering processes becomes reduced with decreasing the number of free carriers .",
    "alternatively , the reduction of the nd scattering rate below @xmath61k can be explained as if the localization mode and the nd term stem from two different electron bands , which can not be distinguished at elevated temperatures .    in sample p0165 , the spectral weight developments in the fir region ( fig .  [ fig : fit ] ( i ) ) reveal a spectral - weight transfer to lower frequencies ( loc2 to loc ) with decreasing temperature , reminiscent of a drude behavior with collapsing scattering rate .",
    "it is important to note , that the spectral weight of the nd term and of the sum of the spectral weights of the localization modes stay constant as a function of temperature .",
    "the loc localization mode in p0165 ( as well as in p015 ) softens with decreasing temperature , while the center frequency of the loc2 mode stays the same at all temperatures .",
    ".parameters of the eufe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 samples investigated in this work , as extracted from their dc - resistivity and optical - conductivity measurements .",
    "note , that bd and nd refer to the broad and narrow drude components at the _ lowest _ measured normal - state temperature ( @xmath65k for sample p015 ; @xmath66k for samples p0165 and p021 ) . @xmath67 and",
    "@xmath68 indicate the large and small superconducting gaps as obtained from the bcs - parametrization fits @xcite to the measured optical conductivity .",
    "the small gap is likely nodal , thus the value should be considered as an averaged one .",
    "@xmath69 denotes the penetration depth . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table ]    thus , all three samples demonstrate at least one drude band with a directly observable @xmath58-linear scattering rate .",
    "this signals the importance of electron - electron interactions in eu - based pnictides of the 122 family .",
    "the localization effects in p015 and p0165 samples strongly affect the optical conductivity and possibly mask the linearity of @xmath56 in other drude bands .",
    "the question remains , why the resistivity of the p015 sample only ( fig . [ fig : res - mag ] ( a ) ) is affected by the localization effects .",
    "this can be explained considering the fact , that the localization effects in p015 appear to be moderate and only affect the carriers when their thermal energy falls below @xmath70 k. in p0165 , however , the localization of a part of the carriers persists up to room temperature , while the remaining itinerant carriers follow the observed nfl behavior .    in the mir and nir spectral ranges ,",
    "all three samples display a spectral - weight transfer from the mirl interband transition to the hund mode upon cooling ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] ( g ) ) .",
    "this is a general observation in iron pnictides and is usually associated to electron correlations originating from the hunds - rule coupling between itinerant and localized electrons @xcite .",
    "in fig . [ fig : sc ] ( a - c ) we show the reflectivity of the investigated samples for two temperatures below the superconducting transition and one temperature right above @xmath33 . unlike in the reflectivity spectra of superconducting eufe@xmath0(as@xmath71p@xmath72)@xmath0 previously published in ref.@xcite@xcite",
    ", we do not see any sharp upturns in the reflectivity , which would indicate positions of dirty - limit isotropic superconducting gaps @xcite . neither a full 100% reflectivity is observed .",
    "consequently , the conductivity spectra do not show any sharp gap - like edge either , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sc ] ( d - f ) .    for homogenous single - phase superconductors ,",
    "there are two possible reasons why no clear signatures of a superconducting gap are observed .",
    "the first option is a strong gap anisotropy , preferably with nodes : optical transitions of the nodal quasiparticles do not allow the gap features to manifest themselves in the optical conductivity @xcite , which is a momentum - averaged response .",
    "the second possibility is superconductivity in the clean limit . in this case , the scattering rate of the quasiparticles is much smaller than the superconducting gap , @xmath73 . as a consequence , @xmath41 at frequencies around @xmath74 is very close to zero already in the normal state ,",
    "thus no gap feature can be detected in the optical - conductivity spectra in the superconducting state @xcite .",
    "below , we argue that realization of both , the clean - limit superconductivity and the gap anisotropy , are likely in eufe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 .",
    "let us note that our optical measurements , performed above and below @xmath75 , show that the ordering of the eu magnetic moments at @xmath75 does not affect the optical conductivity , in agreement with previous optical studies on the parent compound @xcite .",
    "thus , influence of the eu - moments ordering on the optical - gap feature is very unlikely .",
    "although a full multiband eliashberg analysis is the most adequate approach for fitting the optical conductivity of iron pnictides in the superconducting state @xcite , application of this method requires advanced theoretical methods and goes beyond our capability . during the last years",
    ", it has been shown by different groups @xcite that applying a relatively simple model @xcite , which parameterizes the optical response of a bcs superconductor , is often sufficient in order to get a rough estimate for the magnitude of the superconducting gap(s ) in pnictides .",
    "even though we do not observe any clear gap features we can use this model to fit the spectrum of sample p021 in the superconducting state with the constraint , that the plasma frequencies and scattering rates of the bcs terms , as well as all parameters of the lorentz contributions , stay roughly the same as in the normal state just above the superconducting transition . in this sample , the optical response of free carriers is not masked by the appearance of localization modes , thus the analysis is relatively straightforward .",
    "two bcs terms , each replacing a normal - state drude term , were utilized in this fit , as displayed fig.[fig : sc ] ( f ) .",
    "we obtained the gap values of @xmath76@xmath15 and @xmath77@xmath15 for the two bcs terms , which replaced the broad and narrow drude terms , respectively .",
    "for the larger gap , we obtain @xmath78 , which is close to the bcs value . for the small gap , this ratio is below @xmath79 .",
    "this indicates that the isotropic gap is likely not a relevant approach and points towards anisotropy of the smaller gap ( a moderate anisotropy of the larger gap is also possible ) .",
    "since the bcs term with the large / small gap in the superconducting state corresponds to the broad / narrow drude term in the normal state , we can interpret our data in terms of an ( almost ) isotropic gap on the hole pockets and a highly anisotropic ( or nodal ) gap on the electron pockets of the fermi surface .",

    "again , a clear gap edge is not observed .    in order to perform a meaningful analysis of the penetration depth in p015 ,",
    "it is necessary to subtract the contribution of the localization mode from @xmath91 before calculating @xmath83 .",
    "when we do so , we obtain the low - frequency @xmath83 of p015 to be rather similar to @xmath83 of p021 , as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : lamb ] .",
    "the penetration depth , calculated using the fgt sum rule yields now @xmath92 nm , slightly larger than in p021 , but in good agreement with the frequency - dependent @xmath69 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : lamb ] ( a ) .    for p015",
    ", the fit with the bcs terms in the superconducting state requires a spectral - weight transfer from the loc mode to the nd component as temperature decreases and provides @xmath93 and @xmath94 , which is very similar to gap values in p021 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sc ] ( d ) ) . also similarly to p021",
    ", the penetration depth , obtained from the bcs fits , describes the experimental @xmath83 very well , as shown in fig .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the optical responses of itinerant carriers in samples p015 and p021 are very similar to each other ; the differences in the doping level do not affect significantly the values of the superconducting gaps .",
    "the only major difference between these two samples , seen in the optical response , is the localization mode , which is present in p015 and absent in p021 . in the sample with an intermediate doping level , p0165 ,",
    "the absorption due to localization effects is even stronger than in p015 .",
    "this absorption ( modeled above with two lorentzian terms ) completely prevents the observation of any superconductivity - induced changes in the optical spectra of p0165 , even though bulk superconductivity was confirmed in this sample by different magnetization measurements , as discussed in sec .",
    "we pointed out above , the non - systematic behavior of the fir bands in our eufe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 samples as a function @xmath95 is evident for extrinsic character of the fir absorption bands . if the density of localized carriers is not very large ( the case of sample p015 ) , the optical response remains to be primarily dominated by itinerant carriers . in the case of very impure / disordered samples ( sample p0165 ) ,",
    "the optical response becomes fully determined by localized carriers .",
    "looking on the entire set of our experimental data , we can not exclude that sample p0165 has at least two phases , only one of which is superconducting .",
    "the same might be true for sample p015 , but the fraction of the superconducting phase is surely much larger in this sample .",
    "we performed a detailed study of broadband optical response of single - crystalline superconducting eufe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 with @xmath80% , @xmath96% , and @xmath97% .",
    "the former two samples show moderate ( @xmath80% ) to strong ( @xmath98% ) impurity - localization effects , while the later ( @xmath81% ) appears to be very pure .",
    "all of the samples exhibit superconductivity with onsets at comparable temperatures , basically independent of the doping level and appearance of the localization effects .",
    "the response of the itinerant carriers in the normal state can be generally best described by two drude components , which might be related to the hole and electron pockets of the fermi surface , similarly to other pnictides @xcite .",
    "we were able to uncover a linear in temperature scattering rate for at least one of the two drude terms in each of the samples . in the pure @xmath97%-doped sample ,",
    "the linearity is apparent for both bands . in two other samples ,",
    "the linearity is ( partly ) masked by strong fir modes due to the localization effects .",
    "this linearity ( as well as the linear temperature dependence of dc resistivity ) points towards a non - fermi - liquid state in eufe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 , which leads to speculations wether a qcp exists beneath the superconducting dome , as it is evident in the sister compound bafe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 .",
    "analysis of the frequency - dependent optical spectra in the superconducting state allows us to conclude that eufe@xmath0(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath0 is likely a clean - limit superconductor with two gaps : a smaller anisotropic ( or nodal ) gap on the electron portion of the fermi surface and a larger isotopic ( or slightly anisotropic ) gap on the hole pockets .",
    "this is in agreement with theoretical predictions as well as with experimental observations made in other p - substituted 122 iron pnictides .",
    "we are grateful to g. untereiner , c. kamella and e. rose for technical support .",
