    "<S> we present numerical calculations of the snake instability in a fermi superfluid within the bogoliubov - de gennes theory of the bec to bcs crossover using the random phase approximation complemented by time - dependent simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the snaking behaviour across the crossover and quantify the timescale and lengthscale of the instability . </S>",
    "<S> while the dynamic shows extensive snaking before eventually producing vortices and sound on the bec side of the crossover , the snaking dynamics is preempted by decay into sound due to pair breaking in the deep bcs regime . at the unitarity limit , </S>",
    "<S> hydrodynamic arguments allow us to link the rate of snaking to the experimentally observable ratio of inertial to physical mass of the soliton . in this limit </S>",
    "<S> we witness an unresolved discrepancy between our numerical estimates for the critical wavenumber of suppression of the snake instability and recent experimental observations with an ultra - cold fermi gas . </S>"
