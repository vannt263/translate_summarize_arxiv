    "several laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors of the first generation have been operated to detect gravitational wave .",
    "these include geo@xcite , ligo@xcite , tama300@xcite , and virgo@xcite .",
    "these detectors have been improved their sensitivity very rapidly in the past several years .",
    "the direct detection of gravitational waves is important not only because it will become a new astronomical tool to observe our universe , but also because it will become a new tool to test general relativity and other gravity theories in a strong gravity field region .    in this paper",
    ", we present results of the data analysis of the tama300 detector to search for gravitational waves produced by inspiraling compact star binaries , comprised of non - spinning neutron stars and/or black holes .",
    "inspiraling compact binaries are considered to be one of the most promising sources for ground based laser interferometers .",
    "tama300 has been performed nine observation runs of the detector since 1999 .",
    "the total amount of data is more than 3000 hours .",
    "given such large amount of data , it is very interesting to analyze the data to search for candidate gravitational wave events and to set an upper limit to the event rate .    in the past",
    ", there were several works which searched for inspiraling compact binaries using laser interferometer data .",
    "@xcite analyzed ligo-40 m s data in the mass range @xmath0 , and obtained an upper limit of 0.5 [ 1/hour ] on the galactic event rate .",
    "the data from `` data taking 2 '' ( dt2 ) of tama300 in 1999 was analyzed in the mass range @xmath1 @xcite , and an upper limit of 0.59 [ 1/hour ] on the event rate with signal - to - noise ratio greater than 7.2 was obtained .",
    "tama300 s dt6 data and lism-20 m s data taken in 2001 were analyzed to search for coincident signals , and obtained an upper limit of 0.046 [ 1/hour ] on the nearby event rate within 1kpc from the earth @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed ligo s `` 1st scientific run '' ( s1 ) data taken in 2002 , and obtained an upper limit of 1.7@xmath2 per year per milky way equivalent galaxy ( mweg ) in the mass range @xmath0 .",
    "analyzed ligo s2 data taken in 2003 , and obtained an upper limit of 47 per year per mweg in the mass range @xmath0 @xcite , 63 per year per milky way halo in the mass range @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "ligo s s2 data was also analyzed to search for binary black hole inspirals in the mass range @xmath4 , and an upper limit of 37 per year per mweg was obtained @xcite .",
    "ligo s s2 data and tama300 s dt8 data were analyzed to search for coincident signals and an upper limit of 49 per year per mweg was obtained @xcite . in all of above cases , there were no signals that could be identified as gravitational waves .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the data from dt4 , dt5 , dt6 , dt8 , and dt9 of tama300 .",
    "a part of dt6 data which was coincident with lism was already analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the initial results of the analysis of dt8 data was reported in ref .",
    "a part of dt8 data which was coincident with ligo s2 was already analyzed in @xcite . in this paper , we analyze these data again together with the other data in a unified way . until dt6 observation , tama300 was the only large scale laser interferometer which was operated .",
    "thus , it is important to analyze such data to search for possible gravitational wave signals .",
    "further , in order to take advantage of the long length of data from dt6 , dt8 and dt9 , we combine the results from dt6 , dt8 and dt9 data and obtain a single upper limit on the rate of the coalescence of compact binaries in our galaxy .",
    "we also evaluate the systematic errors caused by the uncertainty of the calibration and the background trigger rate .",
    "other errors such like the uncertainty of the distribution model of sources , and the uncertainty of the theoretical templates are also evaluated .",
    "these systematic errors are taken into account to evaluate the upper limit .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we overview the detector and the data we analyze . in section iii , the analysis method is presented . in section iv ,",
    "the results of the analysis are presented . in section",
    "v , the evaluation of the detection probability of the galactic signals and the upper limit to the event rate are shown .",
    "in section vi , we evaluate the errors due to various error sources , and its effect to the upper limit . in section vii , we summarize the results and present the conclusion .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the method to derive the upper limit to the event rate in this paper requires the evaluation of the threshold which corresponds to a given false alarm rate .",
    "this is done by fitting the distribution of triggers as explained in section v. there are statistical errors of the fitting due to the fluctuation of the number of background triggers .",
    "this error results in the error of the threshold , and the detection probability .",
    "we have the error of @xmath5 in the detection probability in dt8 and dt9 cases . in dt6 case ,",
    "as explained in section v , the error of the fitting due to the non - linear property of the distribution was already incorpolated in the fitting .",
    "the statistical error of the fitting itself was very small in dt6 case , @xmath6 .",
    "+   the error due to the monte carlo injectioin test with a limited trial number is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of the monte carlo trials of each run .",
    "this monte carlo error becomes about @xmath9 in the detection probability .",
    "+   the calibration of the sensitivity of tama300 is done by monitoring continuously the response of an injected sinusoidal test signal .",
    "the error of this response is much smaller than the normalization error discribed below , and can be neglected here . in the determination of the transfer function , there are two possible effects which affect the calibration uncertainty .",
    "one is an overall normalization error associated with the magnetic actuation strength uncertainty and its effect on calibration , and the other is uncertainty in the frequency - dependent response .",
    "although the error in the normalization is of order 5% , the long - term drift is unknown .",
    "we thus conservatively adopt 10% .",
    "the frequency - dependent error is known to be much less than 10% , and thus it is absorbed in the uncertainty in the normalization .",
    "the calibration uncertainty leads to the errors of @xmath10 in the detection probability .",
    "this calibration error is expected to depend on the different observation runs , and is expected to drift and/or fluctuate even within an observation runs .",
    "+   we have adopted a specific model for the distribution of binary neutron stars in our galaxy .",
    "if the distance between the sun and the galactic center is different from the adopted value , the detection probability will be changed .",
    "the uncertainty of this distance @xmath11kpc leads to the uncertainty of the detection probability about @xmath12 .",
    "+   we used the wave form based on the 2.5 pn order .",
    "however , currently the best template has 3.5pn order .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath13 due to this is at most 6% .",
    "however , it is reported that the pn wave form itself may contain uncertainty @xcite .",
    "we thus adopt 10% reduction of the estimated @xmath13 as an uncertainty .",
    "this produces an error of @xmath14 in the detection probability .",
    "the above errors propagate to the upper limit of the event rate for each run .",
    "we take a quadratic sum of the errors due to threshold , monte carlo injection test , and calibration , since they show the property of fluctuation , and since they are independent each other .",
    "the sum of these errors , @xmath15 , is listed in table [ tab : errors ] .",
    "the errors due to the binary distribution model and the theoretical wave form produce , simply , the shift of the detection probability .",
    "we thus take a linear sum of them conservatively .",
    "the sum of these errors , @xmath16 is listed in table [ tab : errors ] .",
    "we denote the effect of these errors to the upper limit for each run , @xmath17 , as @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively , which are shown in table [ tab : upperlimit ] .",
    "when we evaluate the total error for each run , we take a quadratic sum of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , since they are independent each other .",
    "as shown in table [ tab : upperlimit ] , the errors of the upper limit to the event rate for each run become @xmath20 [ yr@xmath21 for dt6 , @xmath22 [ yr@xmath21 for dt8 , and @xmath23 [ yr@xmath21 for dt9 .    finally , we evaluate the error for the combined upper limit , eq.([eq : combinedupperlimit ] ) . the effect of @xmath24 to @xmath25",
    "is evaluated by taking a quadratic sum of each effect of @xmath24 to @xmath25 , and we have @xmath26 [ yr@xmath21 .",
    "the effect of @xmath16 to @xmath25 is evaluated by simply shifting each @xmath27 in eq.([eq : combinedupperlimit ] ) , and we obtain @xmath28 [ yr@xmath21 .",
    "the total error in @xmath25 is evaluated by taking a quadratic sum of these two errors .",
    "we have the upper limit with error , @xmath29 $ ] . by taking larger value as a conservative upper limit , we obtain @xmath30.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this value is much larger than an astrophysically expected value , @xmath31[yr@xmath21 @xcite for the coalescence of neutron star binaries . however , this rate is smaller than that obtained by ligo s2 search , 47  [ yr@xmath32mweg@xmath21 , or by ligo - tama joint analysis , 49  [ yr@xmath32mweg@xmath21 .",
    "main reason for this is that the length of data used in our analysis is much longer than these analyses .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the results from the tama300 data analysis to search for gravitational waves from inspiraling compact binaries in a mass range , @xmath33 .",
    "we analyzed dt4 , dt5 , dt6 , dt8 , and dt9 data of tama300 .",
    "there were no triggers which deviate from the tail of the distribution of triggers significantly .",
    "we thus conclude that there is no candidate trigger which can be interpreted as a real gravitational signal . by using the long and sensitive data from dt6 , dt8 and dt9 , we obtained upper limits to the galactic event rate from each observation run .",
    "we combined these results and obtained a single upper limit , 20 [ yr@xmath21 at a 90% confidence level from these three observation runs .",
    "we evaluated the systematic errors due to various effects such like the uncertainty of calibration and the uncertainty of the background estimation . in the upper limit , these effects are included .",
    "the upper limit obtained in this paper is much larger than an astrophysically expected value for the coalescence of neutron star binaries .",
    "however , this upper limit is significant since it is derived by observation",
    ". nevertheless , more sensitive detectors are necessary to obtain more stringent upper limit to the event rate , and to detect the signal .",
    "tama300 is now improving the suspension system by installing the seismic attenuation system in order to obtain better sensitivity and better stability .",
    "when it is finished , it is expected to have much better sensitivity than dt9 .",
    "ligo has already been performed 3rd and 4th scientific runs with better sensitivity than s2 .",
    "further , ligo is now conducting the 5th scientific run since november 2005 , with its design sensitivity .",
    "it can detect the inspiraling binaries up to @xmath3410mpc distance .",
    "they are expected to be able to set a much more stringent upper limit .",
    "when the spin angular momentum of compact objects can not be neglected , the spinless template is not good enough to detect the signal , and we need to employ templates with spins .",
    "however , since the number of parameters becomes much larger than the non - spinning case , it requires very powerful computer resources .",
    "one way to avoid the use of the full templates with spins will be to use some phenomenological templates with small number of parameters @xcite .",
    "we will work on such cases in the future .    despite of the improvement and long term observation of current detectors , the chance to detect gravitational waves by these first generation detectors",
    "will not be very large .",
    "we need more sensitive detectors , such like advanced ligo @xcite and lcgt @xcite .",
    "these detectors will detect gravitational waves frequently , and will be used to investigate the strong field region of gravity and the astrophysics of compact objects .",
