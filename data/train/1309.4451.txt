    "in contrast to the other observables , every diffuse ionized baryon along a sightline contributes equally to the dm . until recently there was no reason to think that redshifted sources existed for which dm could be measured .",

    "consider a toy model motivated by the milky way thick disk in which all galactic disks have a column of @xmath84 . if @xmath85 of @xmath33 sightlines intersect disks ( a factor of a few higher than empirical estimates based on damped ly@xmath10 systems ; @xcite ) , , where the latter is evaluated for a halo spin parameter of @xmath86 ( the rms found in cosmological simulations ) .",
    "this model produces a scale radius that is @xmath87 of the estimated termination radius of the milky way s electronic thick disk .",

    "second , we show in section  [ sec : scattering ] that sightlines that intersect interloping disks similar to or denser than the milky way thick disk can be distinguished from other sightlines owing to scattering .",

    "the pdf of @xmath100 , @xmath101 , is given by the inverse fourier transform of @xmath102 .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : pchar ] ) makes one additional assumption beyond the _ standard halo model _ , that the value of @xmath103 for skewers of length @xmath104 is uncorrelated between adjacent slices .",
    "this is a decent approximation if we evaluate for @xmath105mpc , which manifests in @xmath106 being nearly constant over these @xmath104 .",
    "in addition , the diffuse baryonic component that lies far from halos is just the limit of diffuse profiles in equation  ( [ eqn : pchar ] ) , @xmath107 , noting that @xmath108 .",
    "the form of @xmath109 drops out in this limit .",
    "the curves in figure  [ fig : dmpdf ] show @xmath110 calculated either using equation  ( [ eqn : pchar ] ) or tracing skewers through the simulation .",
    "these panels illustrate its dependence on the extent of the gas profile around halos in the top hat models ( top panel ) , on the specified @xmath67 in the nfw profile models ( middle panel ) , and on the properties of the gas used to tabulate dm  in the simulations ( bottom panel ) .",
    "generically , all the models predict a high ",
    "dm  tail to the pdf .",
    "this tail is dominated by the most massive systems with @xmath111 .",
    "in addition , the more diffuse the gas around halos or the rarer the halos that can hold onto their gas , the more concentrated is @xmath112 .",
    "this trend simply owes to each sightline intersecting a more statistically representative set of structures in the models where the halos baryonic profiles are more diffuse .",
    "lastly , the core of @xmath110 asymptotes to a gaussian with @xmath113 that is determined by large - scale cosmological density correlations in the limit that the baryonic profiles are very diffuse ( e.g. , @xmath114 case , top panel ) or that most sightlines do not intersect a gaseous halo ( e.g. , @xmath115 case , middle panel ) .",
    "the simulation allows us to explore how gas at different temperatures and densities contributes to the shape of @xmath112 .",
    "the dash - dotted curve in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : dmpdf ] excludes gas with @xmath116 from the tally of dm .",
    "the dashed curve excludes gas with @xmath117 .",
    "the comparison of these curves with the solid curve , which includes all of the gas , shows that hot , dense gas ( likely associated with @xmath118 halos ) contributes to the high ",
    "dm  tail in the simulations .",
    "we have also examined the simulation in @xcite with winds turned off : the high ",
    "dm  tail essentially disappears ( and @xmath62 $ ] is halved ) in this simulation probably because of overly - efficient star formation .",
    "it is not possible to separate the dm  contribution that is intrinsic to the sources from that which is extragalactic .",
    "however , the intrinsic contribution does not contaminate the signal if sightlines are stacked based on their impact parameters to foreground galaxies . in addition , stacking does not require precise knowledge of the sources redshifts .",
    "upcoming photometric surveys such as des and lsst aim to identify most @xmath119 galaxies over @xmath87 of the sky . targeted follow - up along each dm  sightline is also a possibility .",
    "stacking requires a resolution of @xmath120 ( or @xmath121 km baselines at @xmath122ghz ) to localize the source to @xmath123 of a foreground @xmath124 , @xmath125 halo .",
    "the enhancement in dm  from a local galaxy with halo mass @xmath12 at impact parameter @xmath92 is @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the dispersion measure profile of the halo , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 the 3d matter overdensity correlation function .",
    "we calculate the latter , `` two halo '' term with @xmath130 and assuming linear theory as in the _ standard halo model _ ( but highly approximate at such small @xmath131 ) .    in a survey with @xmath132 sightlines , the maximum likelihood @xmath133 estimator for a gaussian @xmath134 is@xmath135 where @xmath136 for any variable @xmath137",

    "this estimator assumes that @xmath145 is known , but can easily be generalized to fit a parametric form .",
    "the standard deviation of this estimator is @xmath146=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\overline{\\sigma^2_{{{\\rm dm}}}}}{\\left(\\overline{n^2}-\\overline{n}^2\\right)\\,n_{{{\\rm",

    "figure [ fig : dm_profile ] shows the sensitivity of such a stacking analysis to the mean dm  profile of @xmath148 halos .",
    "the dashed piecewise lines are the @xmath149 error for a survey with @xmath150 and @xmath151 in a radial bin given by the width of each horizontal line segment .",
    "this calculation assumed @xmath152 and that each sightline on average intersects two @xmath148 halos within @xmath32 .",
    "these numbers roughly approximate our model  3 for @xmath153 if the intrinsic dispersion in dm  is somewhat smaller than the cosmological dispersion ( see figure  [ fig : dmvar ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : dm_profile ] shows that both the @xmath150 and @xmath151 cases are sensitive to the @xmath32 top hat model  a model that can not be ruled out with other techniques @xcite  and the survey with @xmath154 is even sensitive to the @xmath114 model . the sensitivity to @xmath155 improves [ degrades ] for a stacking analysis around less [ more ] massive halos compared to our fiducial @xmath156 case owing to the different @xmath157 .",
    "however , this trend is offset ( almost perfectly in the top hat models ) by the likely increase in @xmath158 with halo mass .",
    "scattering ( which broadens an electromagnetic pulse in a frequency  dependent manner owing to path length variations ) could result in dm ",
    "dependent selection effects .",
    "in fact , any millisecond pulse whose sightline intersects an intervening galactic disk is likely to be significantly broadened , over a timescale of @xmath159\\left[1-\\frac{\\chi(z)}{\\chi(z_s)}\\right]\\left(1+z\\right)^{-22/5},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath160 is the `` scattering measure '' , in units of @xmath161 @xcite .",
