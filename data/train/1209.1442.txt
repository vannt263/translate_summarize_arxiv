    "high quality ( q ) factor excessing @xmath0 has been achieved . combining the ultra - small mode volume with the high - q factor ,",
    "the light - matter interaction can be greatly enhanced in wgm microcavities .",
    "therefore , optical wgms are gaining growing attentions in a wide range of fields including ultra - sensitive sensors @xcite , low threshold lasers @xcite , frequency combs @xcite , cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite , and quantum optomechanics @xcite .",
    "the wgms also affect the scattering on spherical particles @xcite , which was found to play an important role in the glory phenomenon @xcite .",
    "in the last twenty years , the high - q optical wgms have been reported in various microcavities , such as liquid droplet @xcite , microsphere @xcite , microdisk @xcite , microcylinder @xcite and microtoroid @xcite .",
    "the excitation and collection of the wgms are essential issues in practical applications .",
    "it is taken for granted that free space coupling to wgms is very inefficient since the radiation loss of circular shaped microcavity is isotropic and low , which brings the difficulty of energy transference between outside and wgms .",
    "near field couplers , such as prism @xcite , fiber taper@xcite and perpendicular waveguide @xcite , enable high efficient excitations and collections to microresonators .",
    "therefore , these near field couplers are widely adapted in experiments .",
    "the underlying mechanism of coupling process between wgms and couplers have been well understood@xcite and many phenomena in the spectrum are reported , such as the analogue of electromagnetically induced transparent ( eit ) @xcite , asymmetric fano line shape @xcite and ringing phenomena @xcite . however , there are some limitations in the near field couplers , such as large footprint , stabilization requirement , and power limit ( high excitation energy would cause strong nonlinear effects in fiber tapers ) .    on another hand , the asymmetric resonant cavities ( arcs )",
    "have been demonstrated to be able to support high - q wgms and give highly directional emission @xcite .",
    "the underlying principle and interesting chaotic ray dynamics in such an open billiard have been studied extensively @xcite . especially , the unidirectional emission cavities have been successfully designed @xcite , which enable high efficient collection of high - q wgms through free space . as the reversal of emission",
    ", the focused beam in free space can excite the wgms , which have been studied in experiments @xcite .",
    "however , the basic features and potentials of this free space beam coupling strategy are not fully explored .    in this paper , we present a theoretical study on free space coupling to high - q wgms in both circular and deformed microcavities .",
    "first of all , the cylinder waves incident to a circular cavity is solved analytically and asymptotically in the cylinder coordinates , and the analytical equations are well consistent with the standard input - output formulation .",
    "then , we consider the excitation of the circular cavity by gaussian beam for practical applications , the maximal efficiency of about @xmath1 can be achieved under phase matching condition . after that , the excitation of deformed cavity by gaussian beam is studied by an abstract model of multimode interaction .",
    "the result shows that the arcs not only gives good matching parameters , but also can balance radiation and non - radiation losses , which can be well adapted in experiments for high efficient free space coupling .",
    "one interesting result is that the asymmetric spectra is universal in the free space coupling as a result of multimode interference , and the energy transferring can not be deduced from the dip depth in the transmission spectrum .",
    "we start with a two - dimensional circular shaped microcavity , where electromagnetic field ( @xmath2 ) can be solved in the cylinder coordinates ( @xmath3 ) analytically .",
    "any electromagnetic field can be decomposed in the basis of bessel functions @xmath4 and hankel functions @xmath5 with integral @xmath6 .",

    ", the energy transfer efficiency without detuning is low .",
    "moreover , the phase of the outgoing wave is strongly changed by the wgm in the over coupling regime with small detuning value , while there is only small perturbation for under coupling regime .    in the case of near field coupler , the extra coupling loss @xmath60 can be controlled by simply adjusting the gap between coupler and cavity , while @xmath59 is an intrinsic parameter that does not change . differently , in the free space coupling case , @xmath61 is an intrinsic parameter determined by material and fabrication which is almost a constant for wgms .",

    ", we can calculate the power ( energy flux ) contained in the gaussian beam @xmath96 where @xmath97 is angular frequency , and @xmath98 is relative permeability .",
    "power of normalized cylinder wave @xmath99 is @xmath100 therefore , the ratio of power contained in the @xmath13-th cylinder waves to that in the gaussian beam is @xmath101 from eq .",
    "( [ gaussian ] ) , @xmath102 is maximal when @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the first condition guarantees the smallest expansion of cylinder waves in momentum space ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the second condition corresponds to the _ phase matching condition _ that the momentum of the pump beam ( @xmath105 ) should be equal to the momentum of the wgm ( @xmath13 ) . in practical applications",
    ", we can manipulate the beam position _",
    "d _ to satisfy the conditions , then @xmath106 therefore , the rate of power transfer from a gaussian beam to the cavity wgm is limited to @xmath107 . under the paraxial approximation",
    ", the waist @xmath82 of a gaussian beam should be larger than @xmath108 , i.e. @xmath109 , corresponding to the energy transferring rate @xmath110 for a cylinder cavity .",
    "when the cavity boundary is slightly deformed @xcite or small perturbations are introduced to the cavity @xcite , highly directional emission can be obtained .",
    "because the boundaries of arcs are not regular , different momentum ( m ) components can couple to each other .",
    "in addition , wgms always exist in pairs , clockwise ( @xmath111 ) and anti - clockwise ( @xmath112 ) traveling modes , in a circular - like shape microcavity , then the general hamiltonian of arc reads @xmath113 here , @xmath114 represents the energy of cavity modes , with @xmath115 is the frequency difference between cavity mode and excitation laser , and @xmath116 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of cavity mode .",
    "the coupling between different modes is @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the coupling coefficient between counter propagation wgms and @xmath119 is the coupling coefficient between co - propagation modes .",
    "the external pumping on modes is given by @xmath120 here , @xmath121 is the coupling strength of the cavity mode to the outside cylinder waves , with @xmath122 , where the external incoming field and outgoing field are represented by cylinder waves as @xmath123 and @xmath124 with @xmath125 .",
    "actually , @xmath111 and @xmath112 are time reversal to each other , so the coupling coefficients satisfy @xmath126 and @xmath127 .    here , we only concern about the arcs with smooth boundary and small deformation which can support high - q wgms . then we can omit the coupling between counter propagation wgms ( @xmath128 ) and the direct scattering induced transition between incoming and outgoing cylinder waves .",
    "thus the heisenberg equation of cavity field are written as @xmath129 where @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 are intrinsic radiation loss and non - radiation loss , respectively .",

    "all the parameters mentioned above can not be solved analytically because of the irregular boundary shape .",
    "realistic details about the free space coupling should be solved by numerical simulation @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we analytically solve the free space coupling to arcs by an abstract model without the specific boundary shape . in this simplified model ,",
    "we assume directional emission is in the form of gaussian beam ignoring the specific boundary of a arc .",

    "we assume that the parameters of emission gaussian beam are @xmath162 , @xmath156 and direction along @xmath81-axis , as shown in fig .",

    "we discussed the coupling in detail using a gaussian beam from left with @xmath166 and on - resonance to a high - q mode of @xmath167 .",
    "firstly , we calculated the beam matching parameter @xmath154 versus the beam position @xmath160 for different beam widths @xmath82 , as shown in fig .",
    "the result shows that good match with @xmath168 can be easily realized with good fault tolerant to the imperfect focus or align of beam in experiments . in the near integrated system",
    ", we can neglect the coupling to other low - q modes @xmath169 , then @xmath170 .",
    "similar to the cylinder case , the critical coupling with @xmath171 guarantees the maximum energy transfer .    with these approximations , we can calculate the far field distributions by substituting parameters into eq .",

    "the outgoing energy is great reduced but larger than @xmath172 as a result of imperfect matching . in under coupling , there is a small reduction of energy in all directions .",
    "however , in over coupling regime , the peak at @xmath173 is split into two peaks , which is attributed to the interference between the transmitted beam and the emission of the cavity mode , as a result of the strong phase shift at the over coupling regime .",

    "as shown in figs .",
    "4(b ) and 4(c ) , the maximal far field intensity is located away from @xmath173 as a result of the refraction of incident beam .",
    "the far field distribution is similar to the case of tunneling coupling , and the eit or asymmetric line shapes are presented in the spectra ( not shown here ) .",
    "according to the above analysis , the coupling to high - q wgms through free space can be efficient . for the cylinder wave",
    ", the largest coupling efficiency can be achieved under the phase matching condition , and the maximum is limited by waist width of a focused gaussian beam , as the ratio of power contained in the cylinder wave is limited . for a deformed cavity ,",
    "the efficiency can be higher since the pump gaussian beam can be well matched to the directional emission beam .",
    "the energy transferred to the cavity is also determined by the coupling regime , i.e. the ratio of radiation loss to non - radiation loss .",
    "the strongest coupling happens when @xmath190 .",
    "the radiation loss @xmath30 decreases exponentially with the increasing of cavity size , but the non - radiation loss @xmath61 is almost constant .",
    "therefore , in a large cavity , @xmath30 is much greater than @xmath61 , which will give rise to very inefficient coupling .",
    "this limitation can be removed in the deformed cavity , as @xmath30 can be tuned by adjusting the deformation .",
    "usually , a large degree of deformation can also lead to better directionality of cavity emission , thus better beam matching .",
    "therefore , we can always tune the deformation degree to achieve the largest energy transfer rate , similar to the tuning of gap between near field coupler and microcavity .",
    "in contrast to near field coupler to microcavity , the asymmetric line shapes are universal in free space coupling to wgms @xcite . in more realistic cases , maybe multiple high - q modes near to each other in spectrum",
    "are involved , and then the interactions between high - q modes are enhanced by the low - q modes mediated mode - mode interaction . from the view of ray dynamics in arc , the high - q modes usually correspond to regular period or quasi - period orbits . due to dynamical tunneling",
    ", the high - q modes can couple to chaotic modes which correspond to chaotic ray trajectories .",
    "therefore , the chaotic sea mediated the indirect coupling between separated regular orbits in phase space ( high - q modes ) , which is also known as chaos assisted tunneling @xcite .",
    "similar to the case of waveguide coupled microcavity @xcite , we can expect more profound asymmetric spectra when take more high - q modes into consideration .",
    "in summary , we present the theoretical study of the free space coupling to high - q wgms in both regular and deformed microcavities .",
    "the coupling by free space beam depends on the _ phase matching _ and _ beam matching _",
    "conditions in regular cylinder cavities and arcs , respectively .",
    "three coupling regimes of free space coupling are discussed : the cavity should work near the critical coupling regime for high efficiency energy transfer . in cylinder cavity ,",
    "the maximum energy transfer efficient is limited , and critical coupling can only be achieved with specific cavity size .",
    "the arcs not only give good beam matching between focused gaussian beam and highly directional emission , but also enable the tuning of the cavity degree of deformation to achieve critical coupling .",
    "therefore , the efficiency approaching unity is possible in realistic experiments of free space coupling to unidirectional emission cavity .",
    "it is found that the asymmetric spectra or peak like spectra instead of the lorentz - shape dip is universal in spectra , and the coupling efficiency can not be estimated from the absolute depth of dip .",
    "our results provide guidelines for free space coupling to high - q wgms , which will be valuable for further experiments and applications of wgms based on free space coupling .",
