    "the point form is one of the three prominent forms proposed by dirac in his seminal paper of 1949  @xcite to formulate relativistic hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "it has the nice feature that the whole lorentz group ( rotations and boosts ) is kinematical , i.e. is not affected by interactions .",
    "this allows to boost and rotate bound - state wave functions in a simple way . as a price ,",
    "all components of the 4-momentum operator become interaction dependent .",
    "the formalism presented here is based on the point form of relativistic quantum mechanics and makes use of the bakamjian - thomas construction  @xcite for introducing interactions in a fully poincar invariant manner . as a consequence",
    "the 4-momentum operator factorizes into an interacting mass operator and a free velocity operator so that it suffices to consider only an eigenvalue problem for the mass operator .",
    "the formalism presented here has been applied successfully to the study of electromagnetic properties of spin-0 and spin-1 two - body bound states consisting of equal - mass particles  @xcite , as well as to the electroweak structure of mesons consisting of constituents with different masses  @xcite .",
    "the starting point of all these calculations is the physical processes in which the form factors can be measured , i.e. electromagnetic scattering or weak decays . to describe these processes in a fully poincar invariant manner a multichannel version of the bakamjian - thomas construction  @xcite",
    "is employed . as mentioned already",
    ", the 4-momentum operator then factorizes into an interacting mass operator and a free 4-velocity operator : @xmath2 the ( free ) 4-velocity operator @xmath3 is defined by @xmath4 and describes the overall motion of the system .",
    "the mass operator @xmath5 , depending on internal variables only , is the quantity of interest , since it contains the information on the internal structure of the system .",
    "electron - meson scattering , e.g. , is then formulated on a hilbert space consisting of a @xmath6 and a @xmath7 sector . a convenient basis consists of , so - called ,",
    "_ velocity states_. these are multiparticle states characterized by the overall 4-velocity and the center - of - mass momenta and spins of its components  @xcite .",
    "the mass eigenvalue equation to be solved has the form : @xmath8 the diagonal elements of the mass matrix contain the relativistic kinetic energies and an instantaneous confining interaction between the quarks .",
    "the transition between both channels is caused by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which are vertex operators that account for the creation and annihilation of one photon , respectively .",
    "they are uniquely related to the interaction lagrangian density of qed  @xcite . eliminating the @xmath7 channel",
    "one ends up with an equation for the @xmath6 component : @xmath11 @xmath12 is an optical potential that describes the ( dynamical ) 1-photon exchange between electron and ( anti)quark . on - shell matrix elements of @xmath12 between ( velocity ) states of a confined @xmath13 pair with quantum numbers of the meson @xmath14 provide the invariant 1-photon - exchange amplitude from which the electromagnetic current of the meson @xmath14 can be extracted : @xmath15 this relation determines the hadron current and thus the electromagnetic form factors in a unique way and it fixes also the normalization of the form factors .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that the resulting electromagnetic current transforms covariantly under lorentz transformations and it is conserved for pseudoscalar mesons . however , because of cluster separability problems inherent in the bakamjian - thomas construction  @xcite one observes that the current obtained in this way can not be decomposed in terms if hadronic covariants only , but one needs additional covariants built with the sum of the incoming and outgoing electron 4-momenta  @xcite .",
    "the need of such additional , spurious covariants resembles the situation in the covariant front - form formalism  @xcite .",
    "there one also encounters spurious dependencies of the currents on a 4-vector that specifies the orientation of the light front .",
    "remarkably , if we let the invariant mass of the electron - meson system go to infinity our electromagnetic form factors turn out to agree with the front - form results computed in the @xmath16 frame  @xcite .",
    "it is quite obvious , how this formalism can be generalized to semileptonic weak decays in order to calculate transition amplitudes , currents and decay form factors  @xcite .",
    "decay processes involve time - like momentum transfers .",
    "unlike scattering the covariant decomposition of decay currents does not require the introduction of spurious covariants , neither in pseudoscalar - to - pseudoscalar nor in pseudoscalar - to - vector meson decays .",
    "form factors can be extracted unambiguously in a frame - independent way  @xcite .",
    "analytical and numerical studies of electromagnetic and weak form factors of heavy - light systems show that the predictions of heavy - quark symmetry are respected when one of the constituent masses goes to infinity  @xcite .",
    "as it should be , one ends up with the , so - called , isgur - wise function  @xcite , i.e. one single , universal , spin - independent form factor that does not depend on the mass of the heavy quark . within our approach",
    "the isgur - wise function acquires a simple analytical form : @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 denoting the initial and final meson 4-velocities , respectively .",
    "@xmath20 is a spin - rotation factor and @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "is by no means negligible , which emphasizes the need of an appropriate relativistic treatment of the spin rotation when boosting bound states . ]",
    "as an example we present numerical results for the transition form factors of the semileptonic @xmath23 decay .",
    "calculations are done with a simple harmonic - oscillator wave function ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) with oscillator parameteter @xmath24  gev .",
    "the most general covariant decomposition of the weak @xmath25 transition current is usually written in the form : @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "as mentioned above , our microscopic expression for the @xmath28 transition current is not plagued by spurious contributions and the covarinat decomposition ( [ eq : jppsvdec ] ) can be applied directly to extract the decay form factors  @xcite . introducing the shorthand notation @xmath29 and adopting the same kinematics as in ref .",
    "@xcite one encounters 10 non - vanishing spin matrix elements of the current , namely @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , @xmath33 . taking into account that @xmath34 and @xmath35 are related by parity , one",
    "is left with only 6 different matrix elements , 4 of them being independent .",
    "one can see that @xmath36 and @xmath37 enter only @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "thus the set @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be used to extract all the @xmath40 decay form factors .",
    "the numerical results for the form factors as a function of @xmath41 ( multiplied by appropriate kinematical factors  @xcite ) are shown and compared with the isgur - wise function and with the available experimental data in fig .",
    "[ fig : decpsv ] .",
    "our numerical values for the isgur - wise function agree with those obtained with a front - form quark model  @xcite .",
    "discrepancies between the point- and front - form approach show up as soon as the decay form factors are calculated for finite , physical masses of the heavy quarks .",
    "most likely , these differences can be attributed to the different roles played by z - graphs , i.e. non - valence contributions , in either approach . in the heavy - quark limit z - graphs",
    "do not contribute to the current , neither in the front form nor in the point form , which explains why the results agree for the isgur - wise function .",
    "for finite quark masses , however , the inclusion of z - graphs seems to be crucial for the frame independence of the decay form factors in front form  @xcite , whereas this is not the case in point form ( as discussed above ) .",
    "decay form factors ( multiplied by appropriate kinematical factors , @xmath42 ) in comparison with the isgur - wise function @xmath43 and with the available experimental data .",
    "the values taken for the physical quark masses are @xmath44 gev , @xmath45 gev and @xmath46 gev .",
    "experimental data are taken from belle  @xcite ( dots ) , cleo  @xcite ( triangles ) and babar  @xcite ( crosses ) assuming that @xmath47 , i.e. the central value given by the particle data group  @xcite .",
