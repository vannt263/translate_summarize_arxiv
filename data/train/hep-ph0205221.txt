    "the existence of the so - called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) has been the one of the most intriguing questions of high energy physics for the almost two past decades .",
    "this novel state of matter has been predicted upon lattice qcd calculations ( for a review see @xcite and references therein ) and the critical temperature @xmath1 for the ordinary hadron matter - qgp phase transition has been estimated in the range of 150 - 270 mev ( this corresponds to the broad range of the critical energy density @xmath2 gev/@xmath3 ) . since na50 collaboration estimates for the energy density obtained in the central rapidity region ( crr ) give the value of 3.5 gev/@xmath3 for the most central pb - pb data point @xcite , it is argued that the region of the existence of the qgp has been reached in pb - pb collisions at cern sps .",
    "the main argument for the qgp creation during pb - pb collisions at the cern sps is the observation of the suppression of @xmath0 relative yield .",
    "@xmath0 suppression as a signal for the qgp formation was originally proposed by matsui and satz @xcite .",
    "the clue point of the na50 collaboration paper @xcite is the figure ( denoted as fig.6 there ) , where experimental data for pb - pb collision values of @xmath4 ( the ratio of the @xmath0 to the drell - yan production cross - section times the branching ratio of the @xmath0 into a muon pair ) are presented together with some conventional predictions . here",
    ", `` conventional '' means that @xmath0 suppression is due to @xmath0 absorption in ordinary hadron matter .",
    "since all those conventional curves saturate at high transverse energy @xmath5 , but the experimental data fall from @xmath6 90 gev much lower and this behaviour could be reproduced on the base of @xmath0 disintegration in qgp @xcite , it is argued that qgp had to appear during most central pb - pb collisions . in general , the immediate reservation about such reasoning is that besides those already known ( see e.g. @xcite and references [ 12 - 15 ] in @xcite ) , there could be a huge number of different conventional models , so until this subject is cleared up completely , no one is legitimate to ruled out the absorption picture of @xmath0 suppression .    in the following talk ,",
    "the more systematic and general description of @xmath0 absorption in the framework of statistical analysis will be presented .",
    "the main features of the model are @xcite :    * \\1 .",
    "a multi - component non - interacting hadron gas appears in the crr instead of the qgp ; * \\2 .",
    "the gas expands longitudinally and transversely ; * \\3 .",
    "@xmath0 suppression is the result of inelastic scattering on constituents of the gas and on nucleons of colliding ions .",
    "for a given a - b collision @xmath7 is fixed at the moment of the maximal overlap of the nuclei ( for more details see e.g. @xcite ) . as nuclei pass each other charmonium states",
    "are produced as the result of gluon fusion .",
    "after half of the time the nuclei need to cross each other ( @xmath8 0.5 fm ) , matter appears in the crr .",
    "it is assumed that the matter thermalizes almost immediately and the moment of thermalization , @xmath9 , is estimated at about 1 fm @xcite .",
    "then the matter begins its expansion and cooling and after reaching the freeze - out temperature , @xmath10 , it ceases as a thermodynamical system .",
    "the moment when the temperature has decreased to @xmath10 is denoted as @xmath11 .",
    "since the matter under consideration is the hadron gas , any phase transition does not take place during cooling here .    for the description of the evolution of the matter",
    ", relativistic hydrodynamic is explored .",
    "the longitudinal component of the solution of hydrodynamic equations ( the exact analytic solution for an ( 1 + 1)-dimensional case ) reads ( for details see e.g. @xcite )    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is a local proper time , @xmath14 is the @xmath15-component of fluid velocity ( @xmath15 is a collision axis ) and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are initial densities of the entropy and the baryon number respectively . for @xmath18 and the uniform initial temperature distribution with the sharp edge at the border established by nuclei radii ,",
    "the full solution of ( 3 + 1)-dimensional hydrodynamic equations is known @xcite .",
    "the evolution derived is the decomposition of the longitudinal expansion inside a slice bordered by the front of the rarefaction wave and the transverse expansion which is superimposed outside of the wave . because small but nevertheless non - zero baryon number densities are considered here",
    ", the above - mentioned description of the evolution has to be treated as an assumption in the presented model .",
    "the rarefaction wave moves radially inward with a sound velocity @xmath19 ( see sect .",
    "[ soundv ] ) .",
    "for an ideal hadron gas in thermal and chemical equilibrium , which consists of @xmath20 species of particles ( here , mesons are up to @xmath21 and baryons up to @xmath22 ) , energy density @xmath23 , baryon number density @xmath24 , strangeness density @xmath25 and entropy density @xmath26 read ( @xmath27 always )    [ eqstate ] @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31    where @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the mass , baryon number , strangeness , chemical potential , spin and a statistical factor of specie @xmath39 respectively ( an antiparticle is treated as a different specie ) . and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are overall baryon number and strangeness chemical potentials respectively .    to obtain the time dependence of temperature and baryon number and strangeness chemical potentials one has to solve numerically equations ( [ barnumb ] - [ entropy ] ) with @xmath26 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 given as time dependent quantities . for @xmath43 and @xmath44 expressions ( [ bjork ] ) are taken and @xmath45 since the overall strangeness equals zero during all the evolution ( see sect .  [ power ] ) .",
    "in the hadron gas the sound velocity squared is given by the standard expression    @xmath46    since the experimental data for heavy - ion collisions suggests that the baryon number density is non - zero in the crr at ags and sps energies @xcite , we calculate the above derivative for various values of @xmath24 @xcite .    to estimate initial baryon number density @xmath17 we can use experimental results for s - s @xcite or au - au @xcite collisions . in the first approximation",
    "we can assume that the baryon multiplicity per unit rapidity in the crr is proportional to the number of participating nucleons .",
    "for a sulphur - sulphur collision we have @xmath47 @xcite and 64 participating nucleons . for the central collision of lead nuclei",
    "we can estimate the number of participating nucleons at @xmath48 , so we have @xmath49 .",
    "having taken the initial volume in the crr equal to @xmath50 fm , we arrive at @xmath51 @xmath52 .",
    "this is some underestimation because the s - s collisions were at a beam energy of 200 gev / nucleon , but pb - pb at 158 gev / nucleon . from the au - au data extrapolation",
    "one can estimate @xmath53 @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "these values are for central collisions .",
    "so , we estimate ( [ speeds ] ) for @xmath54 @xmath52 and additionally , to investigate the dependence on @xmath24 much carefully , for @xmath55 @xmath52 .",
    "the results of numerical evaluations of ( [ speeds ] ) are presented in fig.[fig.1 . ] . for comparison",
    ", we drew also two additional curves : for @xmath18 and for a pure massive pion gas .",
    "these curves are taken from @xcite .",
    "the `` physical region '' lies between more or less 100 and 200 mev on the temperature axis .",
    "this is because the critical temperature for the possible qgp - hadronic matter transition is of the order of 200 mev @xcite and the freeze - out temperature should not be lower than 100 mev @xcite . in low temperatures we can see completely different behaviours of cases with @xmath18 and @xmath56 . we think that this is caused by the fact that for @xmath56 the gas density can not reach zero when @xmath57 , whereas for @xmath18 it can . for the higher temperatures all curves excluding the pion case behave in the same way qualitatively . from @xmath58",
    "mev they decrease to their minima ( for @xmath59 @xmath52 at @xmath60 mev , for @xmath61 @xmath52 at @xmath62 mev , for @xmath55 @xmath52 at @xmath63 mev and for @xmath18 at @xmath64 mev ) and then they increase to cover each other above @xmath65 mev .",
    "to compare with the more realistic picture , we also calculated the sound velocity for the excluded volume multi - component hadron gas model ( for details of the model see @xcite ) .",
    "the gas consists of the same species of particles as in sect .",
    "[ hadgas ] .",
    "the radii of all particles are assumed to be the same and equal to 0.4 fm @xcite .",
    "the results are presented in fig.[fig.2 . ] .",
    "the most crucial new feature of the sound velocity is that it can be greater than 1 in some wide intervals of temperature .",
    "this has already been noticed @xcite , but for the case with baryon number and strangeness chemical potentials equal to zero .",
    "note that now there is strong dependence of the sound velocity on the baryon number density , only cases with @xmath66 @xmath52 have @xmath67 values comparable with the case of the point - like gas in the `` physical region '' ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig.1 . ] and fig.[fig.2 .",
    "in sect .  [ hadgas ] we have explained how to obtain the time dependence of the temperature of the longitudinally expanding hadron gas .",
    "this dependence proved to be very well approximated by the expression @xcite    @xmath68    the above approximation is valid in the temperature ranges @xmath69 $ ] , where @xmath70 mev , @xmath71 and @xmath72 mev .",
    "we started from @xmath73 equal to 227.2 mev ( for @xmath74 @xmath52 ) , 229.3 mev ( for @xmath75 @xmath52 ) and 229.7 mev ( for @xmath76 @xmath52 ) .",
    "these values correspond to @xmath77 gev/@xmath3 ( the initial energy density in the crr has been estimated by na50 @xcite at @xmath78 gev/@xmath3 ) .",
    "then we took several decreasing values of @xmath79 .",
    "for every @xmath73 chosen we repeat the procedure of obtaining the approximation ( [ cooling ] ) , i.e. the power @xmath80 .",
    "the values of @xmath80 as a function of @xmath73 are depicted in fig.[fig.3 . ] for the case of @xmath81 @xmath52 , together with the corresponding sound velocity curve .",
    "we can see that in the above - mentioned interval of temperature the power @xmath80 has the meaning of the sound velocity squared within quite well accuracy .",
    "we would like to stress that we arrived at the same conclusion also for cases with @xmath59 @xmath52 and @xmath55 @xmath52 .",
    "we can formulate the following conclusion : in the `` physical region '' of temperature and for realistic baryon number densities , the longitudinal expansion given by ( [ bjork ] ) results in the cooling of the hadron gas described by ( [ cooling ] ) with @xmath82 , namely :    @xmath83    where @xmath73 belongs to the `` physical region '' .",
    "note that @xmath84 is the exact expression for a baryonless gas with the sound velocity constant ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "it should be stressed that @xmath67 in ( [ coolapp ] ) is constant only for the particular cooling from a given @xmath73 . for different @xmath73 the value of @xmath67 in ( [ coolapp ] ) will change appropriately , that is to the value of @xmath67 in the hadron gas with the temperature equal to this new @xmath73 .",
    "the approximation ( [ coolapp ] ) will be used to simplify evaluations of @xmath0 survival factors in next sections .",
    "it should be added that for the excluded volume hadron gas model the above - mentioned conclusion is no longer valid .",
    "we did the appropriate simulations , but approximations of @xmath85 by a power function were much worse and values of the power obtained were a factor 2 lower than the square of the velocity of sound .",
    "as it has been already mentioned in sect .  [ timetable ]",
    "charmonium states are produced in the beginning of the collision , when nuclei overlap . for simplicity , it is assumed that the production of @xmath86 states takes place at @xmath7 . to describe @xmath0 absorption quantitatively ,",
    "the idea of @xcite is generalized to the case of the multi - component massive gas , here . since in the crr longitudinal momenta of particles",
    "are much lower than transverse ones ( in the c.m.s .",
    "frame of nuclei ) , @xmath0 longitudinal momentum is put at zero .",
    "additionally , only the plane @xmath87 is under consideration , here . for the simplicity of the model",
    ", it is assumed that all charmonium states are completely formed and can be absorbed by the constituents of a surrounding medium from the moment of creation .",
    "the absorption is the result of a @xmath86 state inelastic scattering on the constituents of the hadron gas through interactions of the type    @xmath88    where @xmath89 denotes a hadron , @xmath90 is a charm meson and @xmath91 means a particle which is necessary to conserve the charge , baryon number or strangeness .    since the most crucial for the problem of qgp existence are pb - pb collisions ( see remarks in sect .",
    "[ intro ] ) , the further considerations are done for this case .",
    "so , for the pb - pb collision at impact parameter @xmath92 , the situation in the plane @xmath87 is presented in fig.[fig.4 .",
    "] , where @xmath93 means the area of the overlap of the colliding nuclei .",
    "additionally , it is assumed that the hadron gas , which appears in the space between the nuclei after they have crossed each other , also has the shape of @xmath93 at @xmath9 in the plane @xmath87 .",
    "then , the transverse expansion starts in the form of the rarefaction wave moving inward @xmath93 at @xmath9 .    from the considerations based on the relativistic kinetic equation ( for details",
    "see @xcite ) , the survival fraction of @xmath0 in the hadron gas as a function of the initial energy density @xmath94 in the crr is obtained :    @xmath95    where the sum is over all taken species of scatters ( hadrons ) , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are four momenta of @xmath0 and hadron specie @xmath39 respectively , @xmath98 states for the absorption cross - section of @xmath99 scattering , @xmath100 is the relative velocity of @xmath101 hadron with respect to @xmath0 and @xmath102 and @xmath33 denote @xmath0 and @xmath101 masses respectively ( @xmath103 mev ) .",
    "the function @xmath104 is the @xmath0 initial momentum distribution .",
    "it has a gaussian form and reflects gluon multiple elastic scatterings on nucleons before their fusion into a @xmath0 in the first stage of the collision @xcite .",
    "the upper limit of the integration over time in ( [ surhg ] ) , namely @xmath105 is the minimal value of @xmath106 and @xmath11 .",
    "the quantity @xmath106 is the average time of the escape of @xmath0 s from the hadron medium for given values of @xmath92 and @xmath0 velocity @xmath107 .",
    "note that the average is taken with the weight    @xmath108    where @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 is the nuclear matter density distribution . for the last quantity , the woods - saxon nuclear matter density distribution with parameters from @xcite is taken . in the integration over hadron momentum in ( [ surhg ] ) the threshold for the reaction ( [ psiabs ] )",
    "is included , i.e. @xmath98 equals zero for @xmath112 and is constant elsewhere ( @xmath113 is a charm meson mass , @xmath114 mev ) .",
    "also the usual bose - einstein or fermi - dirac distribution for hadron specie @xmath39 is used in ( [ surhg ] )    @xmath115    for simplicity , we use ( [ coolapp ] ) as the approximation to @xmath116 in ( [ bosef ] ) and @xmath117 and @xmath118 are solutions of only two equations ( [ barnumb ] - [ strange ] ) with @xmath119 given by ( [ coolapp ] ) , @xmath120 by ( [ bjork ] ) and @xmath121",
    ".    as far as @xmath98 is concerned , there are no data for every particular @xmath99 scattering .",
    "therefore , only two types of the cross - section , the first , @xmath122 , for @xmath123 scattering and the second , @xmath124 , for @xmath125 scattering are assumed , here . in the model",
    "presented @xmath122 is put at @xmath126    @xmath127 absorption cross - section . and",

    "the @xmath125 cross - section @xmath128 is assumed to be 2/3 of @xmath122 , which is due to the quark counting .    as it has been already suggested",
    "@xcite also @xmath0 scattering in nuclear matter should be included in any @xmath0 absorption model .",
    "this could be done with the introduction of @xmath0 survival factor in nuclear matter @xcite",
    "@xmath129    where @xmath130 is the nuclear matter density and @xmath131 the mean path length of the @xmath0 through the colliding nuclei .",

    "this is done with the use of the dependence of @xmath94 on the transverse energy @xmath5 extracted from na50 data @xcite ( for details see @xcite ) .    to make the model as much realistic as possible",
    ", one should keep in mind that only about @xmath134 of @xmath0 s measured are directly produced during collision .",
    "the rest is the result of @xmath135 ( @xmath136 ) and @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) decay @xcite .",
    "therefore the realistic @xmath0 survival factor could be expressed as    @xmath139    where @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 are given also by formulae ( [ surhg ] ) , ( [ surnm ] ) and ( [ surv ] ) but with @xmath104 , @xmath143 and @xmath102 changed appropriately ( for details see @xcite ) .    to complete , also values of cross - sections for @xmath144 and @xmath145 scatterings are needed . for simplicity",
    ", it is assumed that both these cross - sections are equal to @xmath123 one .",
    "since @xmath0 is smaller than @xmath135 or @xmath137 , this means that @xmath0 suppression evaluated according to ( [ survsum ] ) is _ underestimated _ here .",
    "now we can complete calculations of formula ( [ surhg ] ) for values of @xmath17 given in sect .",
    "[ soundv ] .",
    "the last parameter of the model is the freeze - out temperature .",
    "two values @xmath146 mev are taken here and they agree well with estimates based on hadron yields @xcite .",
    "firstly , formula ( [ survsum ] ) with the use of ( [ surhg ] ) only instead of ( [ surv ] ) is calculated for the case of ( 1 + 1)-dimensional expansion and results are presented in figs.[fig.5.]-[fig.6 . ] .    for comparison ,",
    "also the experimental data are shown in figs.[fig.5.]-[fig.6 . ] .",
    "the experimental survival factor is defined as    @xmath147    where @xmath148 is the ratio of the @xmath0 to the drell - yan production cross - section in a - b(p - p ) interactions times the branching ratio of the @xmath0 into a muon pair .",
    "the values of the ratio for p - p , s - u and pb - pb are taken from @xcite .",
    "the results of numerical evaluations of ( [ survsum ] ) agree well with the data for greater baryonic cross - section @xmath122 and ( or ) for the lower freeze - out temperature @xmath10 , except the last point measured for the highest @xmath5 bin .",
    "now the full ( 3 + 1)-dimensional hydrodynamic evolution ( in the form described in sect .  [ timetable ] ) and @xmath0 absorption in nuclear matter will be taken into account and results are depicted in figs.[fig.7.]-[fig.8 . ] . to draw also s - u data together with pb - pb ones , instead of multiplying @xmath149 by @xmath150 ,   @xmath151",

    "the quantity @xmath153 is a parameter from the expression for a nucleus radius @xmath154 .",
    "the value of @xmath155 is used to fix the initial position of the rarefaction wave in the evaluation of @xmath156 in ( [ surhg ] ) .",
    "it has turned out that the case of @xmath157 @xmath52 does not differ substantially from that of @xmath158 @xmath52 , so curves for @xmath157 @xmath52 are not depicted in figs.[fig.7.]-[fig.8 . ] .    having compared figs.[fig.7.]-[fig.8 . ] with figs.[fig.5.]-[fig.6 .",
    "] , one can see that adding the transverse expansion changes the final ( theoretical ) pattern of @xmath0 suppression qualitatively .",
    "now the curves for the case including the transverse expansion are not convex , in opposite to the case with the longitudinal expansion only , where the curves are .",
    "as far as the pattern of suppression is concerned , theoretical curves do not fall steep enough at high @xmath94 to cover the data area .",
    "but for some choice of parameters , namely for @xmath122 somewhere between 4 and 5 mb and for @xmath159 fm , a quite satisfactory curve could have been obtained .",
    "precisely , again only the highest @xmath5 bin point falls down of the range of theoretical estimates completely .",
    "but the error bar of this point is very wide . and also the contradiction in positions of the last three points of the 1998 data can be seen .",
    "this means that the high @xmath5 region should be measured once more with the better accuracy to state definitely whether the abrupt fall of the experimental survival factor takes place or not there .    to support the conclusion , main results from figs.[fig.7.]-[fig.8 .",

    "the original data @xcite for @xmath160 and @xmath0 survival factors given by ( [ survsum ] ) multiplied by @xmath161 and now as functions of @xmath5 are depicted there ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "as it has been already mentioned , the main disagreement with the data appears in the last experimental point of the 1998 analysis .",
    "the @xmath162 inelastic cross - section is the most crucial parameter in the model presented .",
    "so to be sure what is the exact result of @xmath0 absorption , one should know how this cross - section behaves in the hot hadron environment .",
    "the newest estimations of @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 cross - sections at high invariant collision energies @xcite give values of @xmath122 and @xmath124 of the same order as assumed here . also it should be stressed that the @xmath166 inelastic cross - sections are considered as constant quantities in the model presented .",
    "but , as the results of just mentioned papers suggest , they are not constant at all .",
    "the cross - sections are growing functions of the invariant collision energy @xmath167 .",
    "therefore , one could think naively that the increase of @xmath94 ( or in other words @xmath5 ) causes the increase of the invariant collision energy @xmath167 on the average and further the increase of the @xmath166 inelastic cross - sections . in this way",
    ", the line describing @xmath0 survival factor could be placed close to the solid curve of fig.[fig.9 .",
    "] for low @xmath94 ( @xmath5 ) , and then , as the @xmath166 inelastic cross - sections increase , this line would go closer to the dashed curve of fig.[fig.9 . ] for high @xmath94 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "so , the experimental pattern of @xmath0 suppression could be recovered .",
    "as a last remark an extension to the point - like gas model will be discused .",
    "the rough estimation of @xmath0 suppression in the framework of the excluded volume gas model @xcite will be presented now .",
    "the estimation done suggests that @xmath0 suppression is much lower in the gas of particles with hard core radii than in the point - like one .",
    "there are two main reasons for such behaviour :    * \\1 .",
    "the freeze - out time resulting from the longitudinal expansion only , is much shorter for the excluded volume gas than for the point - like one , namely for @xmath158 @xmath52 , @xmath168 mev and @xmath169 gev/@xmath3 one obtains @xmath170 fm and @xmath171 fm ( `` @xmath172 '' means `` excluded volume '' and `` @xmath173 '' `` point - like '' ) ; * \\2 .",
    "the initial particle density is much lower for the excluded volume gas than for the point - like one , that is @xmath174 @xmath52 and @xmath175 @xmath52 .    to estimate how these two facts influence @xmath0 survival factor the very rough approximation to ( [ surhg ] )",
    "is explored .",
    "if the transverse expansion , particle masses and thresholds are neglected , then ( [ surhg ] ) takes the following very simple form :    @xmath176    where @xmath177 means one common cross - section for all particles .",
    "so , for values of @xmath178 , @xmath179 and @xmath180 , @xmath181 given above and for @xmath182 mb one obtains :    @xmath183    for comparison @xmath184 there .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 survival factor evaluated for the excluded volume gas model is far above experimentally allowed values .",
    "this means that @xmath0 suppression in a hadron gas is very much model dependent .",
    "to sum up and to stress how vague the idea of @xmath0 suppression as a signal of qgp is , the author would like to call reader s attention to fig.5 of @xcite .",
    "the solid and dotted curves in that figure are exactly the same as curves just presented in fig.[fig.9 . ] .",
    "but the distortion in the qgp is the main reason for @xmath0 suppression in @xcite !",
    "it is also stated there , that results shown `` provide evidence for the production of the quark - gluon plasma in central high - energy pb - pb collisions '' .",
    "so , one could say as well that the na50 pb - pb data provides evidence for the production of the thermalized and _ confined _ hadron gas in the central rapidity region of a pb - pb collision .",
