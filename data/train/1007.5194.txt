    "the dynamics of quantum systems under the influence of time - periodic driving fields is a long - standing problem in quantum mechanics @xcite .",

    "for a more concise review with an accurate description of the floquet - theoretical method , it is recommended to consult chapter 5 in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the past two decades ,",
    "the study of driven quantum systems has sparked renewed interest after the discovery of the phenomenon of coherent destruction of tunneling @xcite . in the original work",
    "@xcite , the authors considered the problem of a particle moving in a double - well potential and perturbed by a monochromatic driving field .",
    "the analysis of the floquet spectrum of the system allowed them to show that , by an appropriate choice of the parameter values of the driving field , the tunneling of the particle through the potential barrier can be brought to a standstill . among the possible applications of this phenomenon",
    ", one can mention the laser - induced trapping of an electron in a quantum - well structure @xcite , and the control of proton or electron transfer reactions .",
    "recently , the phenomenon of coherent destruction of tunneling has been experimentally verified in an optical double well system @xcite , in a bose - einstein condensate in a strongly driven optical lattice @xcite and in single - particle tunneling in strongly driven double - well potentials @xcite .    in order to clarify the mechanism of coherent destruction of tunneling reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has turned out to be useful to consider a simplified two - state model @xcite . in this model ,",
    "all the spatial information contained in the floquet modes is neglected , and only the influence of the lowest quasienergy doublet is taken into account .",
    "the study of this approximate two - state model makes it possible to determine simple conditions for the appearance of the phenomenon of coherent destruction of tunneling .",
    "for instance , in the high - frequency limit , an averaging procedure shows that this phenomenon occurs when the ratio of the amplitude of the monochromatic driving field to its frequency is a zero of the zeroth - order bessel function of the first kind @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that the phenomenon of coherent destruction of tunneling in a two - state model resembles that of dynamic localization observed in a driven , infinite tight - binding system @xcite .",
    "a discussion of their similarities and differences can be found in sec .  4 of ref .  .",
    "recently , the internal relationship between these two phenomena has been clarified in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the last decade ,",
    "several works have been published which describe alternative approaches , beyond the averaging procedure , for the analytical study of a driven two - state quantum system @xcite . in particular , in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors propose a convergent strong - coupling expansion free of secular terms . in refs .",
    "@xcite the method is based on dual dyson series and renormalization techniques . finally , in ref .",
    "@xcite the author applies a multiple scale expansion in the inverse of the driving frequency for the calculation of the floquet states and the quasienergies .",
    "one of the main conclusions of these works is that , for high but finite values of the driving frequency , the coherent destruction of tunneling in a two - state quantum system is only temporary . more precisely , in the high - frequency limit , coherent destruction of tunneling occurs only for time values much smaller than a characteristic time scale proportional to the driving frequency squared .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the quasienergy degeneracy predicted by the averaging procedure when the ratio of the amplitude of the monochromatic driving field to its frequency is a zero of the zeroth - order bessel function of the first kind is exact only in the mathematical limit of infinite driving frequency . for high but finite values of the driving frequency",
    ", there is a quasienergy splitting of the order of the inverse of the driving frequency squared ( see , for instance , ref .",
