    "low - mass giant stars with enhanced lithium are rare .",
    "indeed , li is destroyed in all but the outermost 12% of a main - sequence star such as the sun , and further reduced as the convection zone deepens during giant branch evolution ( pilachowski  1993 ) . yet",
    "li - enhanced giants do indeed exist .",
    "wallerstein & sneden ( 1982 ) discovered that the somewhat metal - rich giant hd  112127 has a li abundance log  @xmath0(li )  = + 3.0  @xmath2  0.2 .",

    "brown  ( 1989 ) noted that this is a factor of 30 higher than expected ; their survey of 644 field giants revealed only one more of similarly high li abundance , plus eight with moderate li enhancements .",
    "these stars are of lower mass and luminosity , and are probably less evolved , than the `` classical '' li - rich giants of the galaxy and the small magellanic cloud ( plez  1993 ) .",
    "the possibly distinct group of li - rich stars associated with dust shells is discussed by de  la  reza  ( 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "this paper reports the serendipitous discovery of another extremely li - rich low - mass giant : iv-101 , an otherwise normal member of the globular cluster m3 ( ngc 5272 ) .",
    "the light - element abundances of iv-101 indicate a moderate degree of mixing and its color favors an evolutionary status on the first ascent of the giant branch prior to the he core flash .",
    "we suggest that it represents a fleeting phase of li enrichment immediately following a significant mixing event , and that such episodes of enrichment are not uncommon among metal - poor and other low - mass giants  they are merely short - lived .",
    "the spectroscopic data discussed here are part of an abundance survey of 47 m3 giant stars conducted in 1998 march with the keck  i high resolution echelle spectrograph ( hires  vogt  1994 ) .",
    "the target stars are largely situated near the center of m3 , selected from the @xmath10 photometry and coordinates obtained with the post - repair hubble space telescope by marconi   ( 1998 ) and communicated by ferraro & dorman ( 1998 ) .",
    "also included were giants from the outer parts of m3 , with photometry from johnson & sandage ( 1956 ) , to provide a nearly complete sample of cluster members within 1.5  mag of the red giant branch ( rgb ) tip .    with a slit width of @xmath11 ,",
    "the keck  i hires achieved a two - pixel spectral resolution of r  =  45,000 on the tektronics 2048@xmath122048 detector .",
    "the s / n ratio was typically 100 per pixel for v  @xmath13  14 .",
    "spectral coverage extended from to with gaps at the ends of each echelle order . while the strong li resonance doublet at was included , the weaker li feature fell in a gap and was not recorded .",
    "we also gathered exposures of quartz and th - ar lamps for spectrum calibrations , and of rapidly rotating b - type stars for telluric line removal .",
    "spectrum reduction procedures were identical to those described in earlier papers of this series ( , sneden  1997 ; kraft  1998 ) .",
    "the equivalent width ( ews ) measures are available by request to us and will be published in the future as part of our larger m3 study .    during inspection of the data we spotted an extremely strong li feature in iv-101 . here",
    "we report abundance analyses for iv-101 and three very similar m3 giant stars .",
    "basic data are gathered in table  1 .",
    "all four stars are radial - velocity members of the cluster ( gunn & griffin 1979 ; pryor  1988 ) . these and our own radial velocity measurements given in table  1 show no velocity variations at the 0.5  level over periods of decades .",
    "our spectra in the vicinity of the li features are displayed in figure  [ liobs ] .",
    "the great strength of the li feature in iv-101 is obvious ( ew  @xmath1  520  m ) , and the al doublet ( @xmath146696 , 6699   ) is much stronger in iv-101 than in i-21 and iv-77 .",
    "the al line strengths of vz  746 are comparable to those of iv-101 , yet vz  746 has no detectable li line .    0.65truein",
    "abundances were derived in the same manner as in our previous papers ( , sneden  1997 ; kraft  1998 ) .",
    "we first considered the photometric information of the stars .",
    "the positions of iv-101 , i-21 , and iv-77 ( johnson & sandage 1956 ) in the m3 cmd of buonanno  ( 1994 ) are shown in figure  [ buonanno ] ; these stars lie hard against the right - hand edge of the rgb ",
    "agb sequence in this figure .",
    "the cmd and an assumed distance modulus of @xmath15  =  15.02 ( djorgovski 1993 ) yield @xmath16  =  2.8 for iv-101 .",
    "the central object vz  746 ( von zeipel 1908 ) was not observed by buonanno .",
    "we have estimated its @xmath17 value from its observed @xmath18 and the @xmath17 vs @xmath18 relation for other m3 giants ( , marconi  1998 ) , but not plotted it in figure  [ buonanno ] .",
    "vz  746 is @xmath190.2  mag brighter than this sequence in the marconi   @xmath20 vs.  @xmath18 diagram .",
    "probably iv-101 , i-21 , and iv-77 are on the first - ascent rgb , but a double - shell agb phase can not be entirely ruled out , especially for vz  746 .",
    "none of the four stars was seen to vary in 90 b - band plates obtained over a two - year period by corwin & carney ( 1999 ) .",
    "trial values of  and log  g were estimated for each star based on the earlier calibration ( sneden  1992 ; kraft  1995 ) of these quantities as functions of 0  and 0  for giants having metallicities [ fe / h ]  @xmath19  1.5 .",
    "final model parameters were determined by iteration , to satisfy standard requirements that abundances deduced from iron lines show no dependence on line excitation , ionization , or ew .",
    "these parameters are listed in table  [ abunds ] .",
    "all four stars are virtually identical in , log  g , v@xmath21 , and [ fe / h ] .",
    "the mean spectroscopic gravity of the four stars , @xmath13log  g@xmath22  @xmath19  + 0.8 , agrees well with the mean evolutionary gravity derived from knowledge of the m3 distance modulus , an assumed mass of 0.85  , and our values of .    for most elements ,",
    "the abundances given in table  [ abunds ] were derived from the ews , while for li , n , o , na , and ba we used spectral syntheses . the li line has doublet structure , and since the line components have unequal transition probabilities , an asymmetrical profile is computed .",
    "s observed line is remarkably symmetrical , possibly indicating a small velocity gradient desaturating this very strong line .",
    "thus our estimate of log  @xmath0(li )  @xmath1  + 3.0 could be an overestimate .",
    "we found no evidence for @xmath23li , but the anomalous li profile precludes a definitive statement on this . for the other three giants , the estimated upper limit log  @xmath0(li )  @xmath24",
    "0.5 is compatible with the low values of halo field giants ( pilachowski  1993 ) .    for three stars ,",
    "c abundances were taken , with minor extrapolation , from the study of the ch band in m3 and m13 giants by smith  ( 1996 ) .",
    "for vz  746 , we assumed that [ c / fe]@xmath25  @xmath1  [ c / fe]@xmath26 , since these two stars have comparable abundances of the other light `` proton - capture '' elements o , na , mg and al . abundances of n were then estimated from synthesis of several very weak cn lines surrounding the [ o ] lines ; these agree well with [ n / fe ] values based on the calibration of the cn bands using the index s(3839 ) by smith  ( 1996 ) .",
    "our derived [ n / fe ] in iv-101 is 0.40.5  dex larger than those of the other three stars , but this agrees with suntzeff s ( 1981 ) claim that iv-101 has a relatively large n abundances .",
    "abundances of the remaining elements are comparable in all four stars , and very similar to their abundances in other cluster and halo field giants .",
    "the abundances of eu and ba are also `` normal '' for the metallicity of m3 ( armosky  1994 ; shetrone 1996a , b ) .",
    "the [ ba / eu]-ratios range from about @xmath27 to @xmath28 , and the four stars do not differ significantly from one another in this ratio .",
    "thus there is no evidence for any s - process abundance enhancements .",
    "overall , the general abundance patterns simply suggest that proton - capture nucleosynthesis has gone further in iv-101 and vz  746 than in i-21 and iv-77 : c , o and possibly mg are depleted , while n , na , and al are enhanced in iv-101 and vz  746 compared to i-21 and iv-77 .",
    "these four stars display na vs.  o and al vs.  mg anticorrelations , symptoms of deep mixing among m3 and m13 giants ( _ cf .",
    "_ , kraft  1997 ; shetrone 1996a , b ) . except for the overabundance of li , iv-101 has essentially the same abundances as do well - mixed giants in m3 and m13 .",
    "there are more of these stars in m13 than in m3 , but they are not rare in either cluster .",
    "it is improbable that m3 iv-101 has retained its primordial li abundance while still occupying a normal place in the m3 color - magnitude array .",
    "the li abundance of m3 iv-101 is higher than its probable initial value of log  @xmath0(li )  @xmath1  + 2.2 , that of halo turnoff stars ( , spite & spite 1982 ; king  1996 )",
    ". thus accretion of a substellar body that has not depleted its li ( e.g.  brown  1989 ) can not provide enough additional li .",
    "accretion of li from a circumstellar disk also appears unlikely .",
    "the presence of substantial cool material would also be seen in the na d  lines , whose line formation conditions are similar to those of the li 6707    doublet .",
    "but the d  lines in iv-101 are indistinguishable from those of two of the other three giants .    instead",
    ", fresh li must have been produced and convected into the envelope of iv-101 .",
    "this probably happened in a nucleosynthetic `` event '' that included the `` beryllium transport process '' first proposed by cameron & fowler ( 1971 ) .",
    "this fusion sequence is @xmath29he(@xmath30,@xmath31)@xmath32be(e,@xmath33)@xmath32li , with the requirement that the @xmath32be created in the nuclear processing zone be transported to cooler envelope regions so that the eventual @xmath32li product will not be destroyed by proton captures .",
    "cameron & fowler originally wanted this mechanism to operate in he - shell fusion zones , in order to simultaneously create the li and s - process overabundances that are observed ( , plez  1993 ) in some s and c stars . but the greatly altered proton - capture element abundances , unaccompanied by a barium abundance enhancement , probably rules out a he - fusion zone origin for the large li abundance in iv-101 .",
    "li synthesis in a hydrogen shell fusion zone seems more likely .",
    "deep envelope mixing in low mass stars is explored by sackmann & boothroyd ( 1999 ) , who call their mechanism `` cool bottom processing '' , and focus on its application to the li - rich giants of de  la  reza  ( 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "they studied both single `` nucleosynthetic event '' and `` steady state '' models of various mass / metallicity combinations .",
    "they argue that the @xmath32li production process , which depletes @xmath29he , should be even more efficient in globular cluster giants than in the giants discussed by de la reza , since the lower metallicity cluster stars have hotter cno h - burning shells .",
    "our abundance results can not shed light on the physics of the nucleosynthesis event ( a hydrogen shell - source instability ?",
    "see von  rudloff  1988 ) .",
    "but we can argue that the li seen in iv-101 was most probably synthesized recently , because the li so produced is likely to be destroyed on relatively short time scales .",
    "in classical models , an m3 star with m@xmath34  =  2.8 has t  =  1.1@xmath1210@xmath23  k at the base of its convective envelope ( sweigart & gross 1978 ) .",
    "li is destroyed by proton capture at temperatures roughly twice this value , so even modest overshoot of moving fluid cells below the convection zone would bring about li depletion .",
    "such mixing probably occurs quasi - continuously for all stars on the rgb , since virtually all bright globular - cluster giants show some evidence for enhanced proton - capture products . to date",
    ", li has been detected in only two other stars out of @xmath19100 globular cluster giants examined at high spectral resolution .",
    "thus the depletion time scale for li in globular - cluster giants must be @xmath244@xmath1210@xmath35  yr , 2% of the evolutionary time scale to the rgb tip of 2@xmath1210@xmath23  yr ( rood 1972 ; kraft  1993 , fig .",
    "the two other known li - rich globular cluster giants differ somewhat from the abundance pattern of iv-101 .",
    "the m5 w  vir variable v42 ( carney  1998 ) shares the low o , high na , and normal ba / eu of iv-101 , but neither its mg nor al are significantly altered , and the li enhancement is far less : log  @xmath0(li )  @xmath1  + 1.8 .",
    "li in this agb star surely must have been produced on the agb itself , again possibly due to h - shell burning , but shortly before the star `` looped '' into the w  vir domain .",
    "too much time would have elapsed since the first rgb ascent for li synthesized then to have survived in v42 . in ngc  362",
    ", smith  ( 1999 ) discovered a strong li line in the giant - branch tip variable v2 .",
    "their derived abundance is log  @xmath0(li )  @xmath1  + 1.2 ; other light elements show no obvious abundance anomalies .",
    "the sackmann & boothroyd ( 1999 ) `` cool bottom processing '' may have been at work in these two stars , but their cases are not as easy to make as in m3 iv-101 .    de  la  reza  ( 1996 , 1997 ) argue that their li - rich low - mass , high metallicity field giants have recently ejected li - rich dusty shells .",
    "iras surveys ( , gregorio - hetem  1993 ; de la reza  1996 ) detect shells in a large fraction of these stars .",
    "we looked for evidence for a dusty shell surrounding iv-101 by comparing iras 100  fluxes centered on each of the four stars listed in table  [ abunds ] . using the dirbe - calibrated iras maps of schlegel  ( 1998 )",
    ", we found that the 100@xmath36 m fluxes at the positions of iv-101 , i-21 , vz  746 , and iv-77 agree to within 15% .",
    "unfortunately , 100  flux might not be detectable from a shell in which the metallicity is reduced forty - fold .",
    "we also examined the radial velocity of the deep absorption cores of the na  d lines which , in cool giants , often show evidence of outflow in the form of a cold expanding shell ( peterson 1981 ) .",
    "relative to neighboring weak fe and ti lines , the core displacements are 2.3 , 2.4 , + 2.1 , and 2.5  , respectively , for these four stars , again suggesting that iv-101 is in no way unusual .",
    "we can not definitely say whether the proposed mixing event is a rare one due to individual circumstances , or whether such events commonly occur during the rgb and agb evolution of low - mass giants . a mixing event that produces a li enhancement",
    "may truly be an anomaly in globular - cluster stellar evolution .",
    "the similarity of the cno and namgal abundance ratios in iv-101 ( with high li ) and vz  746 ( with undetectable li ) might suggest this .",
    "perhaps circulation currents move faster to transport @xmath32be in iv-101 than in vz  746 , indicative of a general spread of internal angular momenta among cluster giants ( _ cf . _ pinsonneault 1997 ) .",
    "since peterson ( 1983,1985 ) showed that bhb stars in m13 have larger rotational velocities than do both m3 and m5 bhb stars , giants in the globular cluster m13 might also be expected to show li enhancements .",
    "however , our inspection of the spectra of kraft  ( 1997 ) revealed no prominent li lines in their 18 giants .    mixing events may be relatively common features of the normal stellar evolution of globular - cluster and other low - mass giants , but might be rarely observed because of the rapid destruction of newly minted li . in this scenario ,",
    "iv-101 has recently experienced such an event ; a similar event may also have occurred in vz  746 but sufficiently far in the past ( @xmath2210@xmath35  yr ) that the li has by now been completely destroyed .",
    "such events probably occur at various luminosities along the giant branch .",
    "this is consistent with the appearance all along the giant branch of changes in cno and namgal abundance ratios .",
    "should li enrichment be a common occurrence , then roughly 12% of all such giants should show some li enhancement .",
    "should the he flash be involved , then the red horizontal branch stars should show enhancements more frequently .",
    "we thank franz ferraro and ben dorman for providing new m3 hst photometry and astrometry , and appreciate the helpful comments on this work by inese ivans and bruce carney .",
    "this research was supported by nsf grants ast-9217970 to rpk and jpf , ast-9618502 to rcp , and ast-9618364 to cs .",
    "this paper is dedicated to the memory of our beloved colleague ed langer , who died after a brief illness on february 16 , 1999 .",
    "ed brought a unique theoretical perspective to our globular cluster abundance studies .",
    "his career truly embodied the academic ideals of inspiration in both teaching and research .",
