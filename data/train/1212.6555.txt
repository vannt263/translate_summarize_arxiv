    "working out a quantitative description of the properties of dense strongly interacting matter produced in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions presents one of the most fascinating problems in high energy physics .",
    "the simplest ( albeit not unique ) way of putting the experimental data from rhic @xcite and lhc @xcite into a coherent framework is to describe the essential physics of these collisions as a hydrodynamical expansion of primordial quark - gluon matter that , after a short transient period , reaches sufficient level of local equilibration allowing the usage of hydrodynamics .",
    "the features of the experimentally observed energy flow , in particular the presence of a strong elliptic flow , suggest early equilibration of the initially produced matter and small shear viscosity of the expanding fluid , see e.g. the discussion in @xcite and @xcite devoted to rhic and lhc results respectively .    can stylized features of primordial quark - gluon matter , in particular its anomalously low viscosity , be described within a weakly coupled theory , i.e. as a plasma composed of quasiparticles with the quantum numbers of quarks and gluons ? to address this question let us recall that extensive experimental studies of `` ordinary '' electromagnetic plasma has demonstrated , see e.g. @xcite , that it is practically never observed in the state of textbook thermal equilibrium .",
    "realistic description of the properties of experimentally observed qed plasma is possible only through taking into account the presence , in addition to thermal excitations , of randomly excited fields .",
    "the resulting state was termed _",
    "turbulent plasma_. collective properties of turbulent plasmas are markedly different from those of the ordinary equilibrium plasmas .",
    "in particular , they are characterized by anomalously low shear viscosity and conductivity , dominant effects of coherent nonlinear structures on transport properties .",
    "thus it is natural to consider turbulent qcd plasma as a natural candidate for describing the primordial quark - gluon matter in the weak coupling regime .",
    "calculation of shear viscosity of turbulent qgp performed in @xcite has indeed demonstrated that its shear viscosity is anomalously small . in the present paper",
    "we focus on studying the leading turbulent contributions to polarization properties of turbulent relativistic plasma . for simplicity",
    "we restrict our consideration to the abelian case . the non - abelian generalization is briefly described in section  [ conc ] .",
    "a weakly turbulent plasma is described as perturbation of an equilibrated system of ( quasi-)particles by weak turbulent fields @xmath0 . in the collisionless vlasov approximation ,",
    "the plasma properties are defined by the following system of equations ( @xmath1 is a regular non - turbulent field ) : @xmath2f(p , x , q)=0 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\partial^{\\mu}\\left ( f^r_{\\mu \\nu } + f^t_{\\mu \\nu } \\right)= j_{\\nu}(x ) = e \\sum_{q , s}\\int dp\\ , p_{\\nu}\\ , q\\ , f(p , x , q ) .",

    "it is fully characterized by the polarization tensor @xmath6 defined as a variational derivative of the averaged induced current @xmath7 over the regular gauge potential @xmath8 : @xmath9 let us rewrite the kinetic equation in ( [ kinetic+maxw ] ) in the following condensed form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a distribution function characterizing the original non - turbulent plasma and introduce the following systematic expansion in the turbulent and regular fields : @xmath12 where powers of @xmath13 count those of @xmath14 and powers of @xmath15 count those of @xmath16 .",
    "turbulent polarization is described by contributions of the first order in the regular and the second in the turbulent fields .",
    "the lowest nontrivial contribution to the induced current ( [ incur ] ) is thus given by @xmath17 .",
    "we have @xmath18 where @xmath19      generic expression for the polarization tensor taking into account turbulent effects can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "both longitudinal and transverse components can be presented as a sum of hard thermal loops ( htl ) contributions and the gradient expansion in the turbulent scale @xmath22 : @xmath23 \\label{gradexp } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath24 and the standard htl contribution @xmath25 , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\pi_{t}^{\\mathrm htl } ( \\omega,{\\left| \\mathbf { k } \\right|})= m^2_d \\dfrac{x^2}{2 } \\left[1+\\dfrac{1}{2 x } \\ ; ( 1-x^2 ) \\ ; l(x ) \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & l(x ) \\equiv \\ln\\left|\\dfrac{1+x}{1-x}\\right|-\\imath\\pi\\theta(1-x ) ; \\;\\;\\ ; m^2_d = e^2 t^2/3 . \\label{htl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the computation of turbulent polarization was carried out to second order in the gradient expansion @xcite . in what follows",
    "we restrict ourselves to discussing the leading contribution to the imaginary part of the polarization function corresponding to the turbulent modification of landau damping in ( [ htl ] ) : @xmath26 the functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 are shown in fig .",

    "[ pct1 ] can be formulated as follows :    1 .",
    "* timelike domain . * from fig .",
    "[ pct1 ] we see that the sign of the imaginary part of the turbulent contribution to the polarization operator in the timelike domain @xmath30 is negative and corresponds to turbulent damping of timelike collective excitations .",
    "this refers to both transverse and longitudinal modes .",
    "as the htl contribution in this domain is absent , this turbulent damping is a universal phenomenon present for all @xmath31 such that @xmath32 and all values of the parameters involved ( @xmath22 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) .",
    "the turbulent damping leads to an attenuation of the propagation of collective excitations at some characteristic distance .",
    "* spacelike domain .",
    "* the situation in the spacelike domain @xmath35 is more diverse .",
    "in contrast with the timelike domain the gradient expansion for the imaginary part of the polarization tensor starts from the negative htl contribution corresponding to landau damping . as seen from fig .",
    "[ pct1 ] the imaginary parts of turbulent contributions to the longitudinal polarization tensor are negative and are thus amplifying the landau damping .",
    "the most interesting contributions come from the turbulent contributions to the transverse polarization tensor .",
    "we see that the electric contribution @xmath36 $ ] in the spacelike domain is positive at all @xmath37 while the magnetic contribution @xmath38 $ ] is negative for @xmath39 and positive for @xmath40 .",
    "this means that the turbulent plasma becomes unstable for sufficiently strong turbulent fields .",
    "let us briefly discuss some relevant points :    * 1 . * the above presented results",
    "are obtained in the framework of a perturbative expansion based on two crucial assumptions .",
    "first , one assumes slow temporal evolution of the distribution function due to particle interaction with turbulent fields thus neglecting the corresponding @xmath41 contributions .",
    "second , changes in the distribution function are treated as small .",
    "this , in turn , means that turbulent fields should be small enough . in this sense",
    "the reliable results refer to small modifications of landau damping but , as the onset of turbulent instability takes place for parametrically large fields , this result should be considered as a qualitative indication .",
    "the observed instability can be termed `` secondary '' because the turbulent fields themselves result from some `` first level '' instabilities .",
    "the origin of the effect is in turbulent stochastic inhomogeneity and thus similar to stochastic transition radiation , which vanishes in the limit @xmath42 ) @xcite .",
    "the non - abelian generalization of the above - described results for the imaginary part of the polarization tensor leads to identical expressions , the only difference being in trivial color factors , just as in the htl case .",
