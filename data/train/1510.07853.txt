    "<S> we demonstrate here experimentally temporal summation in a neuromimetic micropillar laser with integrated saturable absorber . </S>",
    "<S> temporal summation is the property of neurons to integrate delayed input stimuli and to respond by an all - or - none kind of response if the inputs arrive in a sufficiently small time window . </S>",
    "<S> our system alone may act as a fast optical coincidence detector and paves the way to fast photonic spike processing networks .    </S>",
    "<S> neuromimetic photonic systems are optical systems that mimic the functionalities or the architecture of biological neurons , and can represent an alternative path for computing and processing information very efficiently both in terms of energy , speed , and robustness versus noise @xcite .    from a functional and basic point of view </S>",
    "<S> , a biological neuron can be thought of as a system than can integrate information from various stimuli , and respond in an all - or - none fashion if the integrated input stimuli exceed a certain threshold @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this latter property is called excitability and has been experimentally demonstrated already in many nonlinear semiconductor optical systems , like active semiconductor cavities with feedback @xcite , with optical injection @xcite or with saturable absorber @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the former property is called temporal summation . </S>",
    "<S> temporal summation refers to the ability of the system to integrate different , potentially delayed , presynaptic stimuli and to emit a spike if the integration of the inputs exceeds the excitable threshold . since in that case the system acts as an integrator </S>",
    "<S> , it has a time constant and the summation only takes place if the presynaptic stimuli arrive within in a given time window . while most of the cortical neurons are integrators @xcite , note that there also exists so called resonator neurons for which summation rules depend more on the phase of the input stimuli with respect to their subthreshold oscillation frequency @xcite .    in optical systems , </S>",
    "<S> the response is in the form of an intensity spike with a characteristic shape and can be well under the nanosecond timescale @xcite . following the demonstration of excitability in a planar semiconductor laser with integrated saturable absorber @xcite , it has been suggested @xcite that this kind of system could act as a leaky integrate - and - fire neuron , a model of neuron widespread in neuroscience @xcite and optically implemented with telecom components in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the excitable response of micropillar lasers with integrated saturable absorber has been investigated in @xcite demonstrating the absolute and relative refractory periods , in complete analogy to biological systems . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the response of a micropillar laser with integrated saturable absorber to sub - threshold stimuli and show that the system can integrate the stimuli and emit an excitable spike if the stimuli are close enough in time . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates temporal summation in this system and its ability to act as a fast optical coincidence detector @xcite , a property usable for optical pattern recognition tasks . </S>",
    "<S> this property is also at the base of some neurocomputational models for e.g. sound localization in the barn owl auditory system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also of paramount importance to fabricate optical neuromimetic circuits by e.g. coupling several micropillar units since , together with excitability , it demonstrates a fast and compact leaky integrate - and - fire optical neuron .    </S>",
    "<S> the experiment consists of a micropillar laser with integrated saturable absorber of original design described in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the micropillar is optically pumped by a laser diode array emitting around 800 nm and emits light close to cavity resonance designed at 980 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the active medium consists of two ingaas / algaas quantum wells while the saturable absorber medium has only one quantum well . </S>",
    "<S> optical perturbations are sent to the system thanks to a ti : sa model - locked laser emitting @xmath0ps duration pulses with a @xmath1mhz repetition rate ( see figure [ fig : setup ] ) </S>",
    "<S> . the rate can be down - sampled thanks to a pulse picker . </S>",
    "<S> a tunable delay line is inserted in the perturbation path allowing consecutive perturbations with a delay of several hundreds of picoseconds to several nanoseconds . </S>",
    "<S> the pump and perturbation beams are coupled into the micropillar thanks to a dichroic mirror and a microscope objective . </S>",
    "<S> two fast avalanche photodetectors ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) with 10ghz and 4ghz bandwidth respectively record the input pulses and the response from the micropillar . </S>",

    "<S> the micropillar is driven in the excitable regime , 9% below the self - pulsing threshold , thus no laser light is emitted . </S>",
    "<S> two consecutive sub - threshold perturbations are sent onto the micropillar at 797.5 nm , close to the pump wavelength , with a variable delay @xmath5 . the first and second perturbation are set to 74% and 80% of the excitable threshold so that none of each perturbation is able by itself alone to trigger an excitable response . </S>",
    "<S> since noise is present in the system ( either internal , spontaneous emission noise or external noise sources such as pump noise or noise in the perturbation amplitude ) , we record the response of the system after sending 10000 identical perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown on fig.[fig : traces - sum - resp ] . for a large perturbation delay ( @xmath6 , fig.[fig : </S>",
    "<S> traces - sum - resp]f ) , the perturbations rarely adds - up to trigger an excitable response while for shorter ones , a clear , large amplitude response @xmath7 is visible . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the system integrates the perturbations which produces an above - threshold stimulus able to trigger a large , excitable response . </S>",
    "<S> note that the excitable response , when present , has always the shape depicted on fig.[fig : traces - sum - resp]a ) when a single event is plotted ( green curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> the average response has a dispersion in time because of the dynamical delay induced by the noise , which can be mostly attributed to pump and perturbation noise . in order to quantify the response we plot in fig.[fig : ampli]a the median of the response amplitude @xmath7 versus delay @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> a clear transition is visible in the amplitude : for delays below 610ps the perturbations trigger an excitable response and are thus temporally summed . for larger delays </S>",
    "<S> the summation does not occur anymore . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is in stark contrast to the case of a gain - switched laser that would respond linearly . </S>",
    "<S> the transition depends on the excitable threshold value and thus on the bias pump @xcite , and on the amplitude of the incoming perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> summation also occurs for a resonant perturbation at the cavity resonance close to 980 nm , as can be seen on fig.[fig : temp - sum - coherent ] . in that case </S>",
    "<S> , the excitation wavelength is @xmath8 nm . the bias pump is set to 90% of the self - pulsing threshold in the excitable regime , as can be seen in the inset . </S>",
    "<S> the two perturbations are set 44% and 66% of the excitability threshold for the direct and delayed pulses respectively . </S>",
    "<S> they are clearly visible in the recorded traces and are marked by arrows . </S>",
    "<S> temporal summation occurs for short delays ( a ) , 220ps and to a lesser extent b ) 350ps ) and is absent for the other delays ( c  e ) 450 , 540 and 630ps ) . </S>",
    "<S> contrarily to the incoherent excitation case , the excitable curve in inset shows a marked plateau for stimuli above the excitable threshold . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is important in view of cascading several excitable units . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that temporal summation is possible for incoherent ( perturbation on the gain carrier density ) and `` coherent '' ( perturbation on intensity at cavity resonance ) adds some flexibility to the system and has no counterpart in biological systems .    </S>",
    "<S> note also that there is a delay of nonlinear origin in the response that depends on the summed perturbations ( fig.[fig : ampli]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism is interesting from a neuromimetic point of view since it provides a natural time - coding mechanism for the amplitudes : for a large input the delay is short , while it is long for a small ( supra - threshold ) summed input .     : </S>",

    "<S> the dynamical variables are the intracavity intensity @xmath21 , the gain @xmath22 and the absorption @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> recombination rates of carriers in the gain and saturable absorber sections are respectively @xmath24 and @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> other parameters are @xmath26 the saturation parameter , @xmath27 the linear losses and @xmath28 the spontaneous emission factor . </S>",
    "<S> the term @xmath29 is directly proportional to the carrier density in the gain section . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath28 parameter is small here and steady state solutions can be expended in power series of @xmath28 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath30 be a steady state solution of eqs.[eq : yamada ] . a simple approach to get </S>",
    "<S> an analytic insight into the dynamics is to consider that the intensity is small ( @xmath31 ) and almost constant as long as a pulse has not been triggered . </S>",
    "<S> suppose at time @xmath32 a first delta - like sub - threshold perturbation is sent e.g. on the gain followed by a second perturbation on at time @xmath33 ( in units of the photon lifetime in the cavity ) such that @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the dirac delta function . </S>",
    "<S> we can then solve for @xmath36 such that    @xmath37+\\nonumber \\\\   &   & \\pi(t-\\delta)\\mu_{2}\\exp\\left[\\frac{-\\gamma_{g}\\left(t-\\delta\\right)}{1+i_{ss}}\\right]\\label{eq : gain - net}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath38 the unit - step function . </S>",
    "<S> as noted in @xcite , in a first approximation the net gain @xmath39 governs the triggering of an excitable pulse : a pulse can only be excited if @xmath40 exceeds zero for a sufficiently large amount of time . </S>",
    "<S> hence the final state of the system is controlled by the net gain immediately after the second perturbation at @xmath41 ( always considering a first , sub - threshold stimulus ) . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simulations are shown on fig.[fig : gainnet ] . </S>",
    "<S> the net gain is plotted together with the response to the consecutive stimuli . </S>",
    "<S> simulations of the full system ( eqs.[eq : yamada ] ) and of the approximate solution ( eqs.[eq : gain - net ] ) for the net - gain are shown . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters are similar to the one used in @xcite except the recombinations rates that have been tuned to match better the experimental results . with the estimated photon lifetime of the empty cavity being 3.25ps </S>",
    "<S> , a reasonable qualitative agreement is met between the model and the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the critical delay is found to be @xmath42 , that is to say 708ps in physical units with the estimated photon lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> this is in reasonable agreement with the experimental value in fig.[fig : ampli]a between 600 and 700ps and for incoherent perturbation conditions similar to those of the experiment : namely , consecutive perturbations of amplitude 74% of the single perturbation excitable threshold @xmath43 with the pump at 91% of the self - pulsing threshold ( corresponding here to the numerical value of 2.88 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sub - threshold dynamics of the net gain is very well reproduced by the linear approximation solution until it completely fails when a pulse is triggered , as expected . for the longest delay ( @xmath44 ) , </S>",
    "<S> when the summed perturbations are sub - threshold , the approximate net gain deviates from the full solution after the second perturbation because it passes close to 0 and hence the intensity dynamics , even failing to trigger an excitable response , has a non - negligible influence on it . </S>",
    "<S> the response and the delay in the response versus delay between the sub - threshold stimuli are shown in fig.[fig : ampli]b . </S>",
    "<S> a good agreement is found with the experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> the response abruptly switches to zero when the delay @xmath5 is larger than a critical delay @xmath42 . at this point , </S>",
    "<S> the response delay @xmath19 diverges as one expects . </S>",
    "<S> note that there is a point for the response delay @xmath19 in the experimental curve ( fig.[fig : ampli ] ) even after the critical delay @xmath45 because of noise that is able to trigger a few excitable pulses even for stimuli on average below the excitable threshold . </S>",
    "<S> these events are taken into account for the determination of @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the divergence of the delay for perturbations close to the excitable threshold is also responsible for the large dispersion in response times clearly visible in fig.[fig : traces - sum - resp]d - f ) because a larger number of stimuli will be brought just above the excitable threshold in these cases . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to notice that the final state of the system is different for asymmetric perturbations : for a balanced perturbation such that @xmath46 is constant , the highest net gain at time @xmath5 is obtained for asymmetric perturbations with @xmath47 . </S>",

    "<S> the excitable threshold is @xmath49 , and @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the delays are @xmath51 corresponding respectively to physical delays of 200 , 400 , 600 and 800ps . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the critical delay is computed for two input stimuli of equal amplitudes @xmath52 in fig.[fig : critical - delay ] . for an amplitude @xmath53 , </S>",
    "<S> temporal summation never occurs since the summed stimuli are not large enough to cross the excitable threshold even for zero delay . on the contrary , for larger stimuli </S>",
    "<S> the maximum possible delay giving rise to an excitable response increases first almost linearly with the stimulus strength . when a single stimulus is almost able to trigger an excitable response obviously the maximum delay increases and diverges .    </S>",
    "<S> critical delay @xmath45 versus amplitude of the two stimuli for @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> dashed lines correspond to the case of fig.[fig : ampli](b ) and @xmath55 . ]    in conclusion we have studied the effect of consecutive sub - threshold stimuli on the response of a semiconductor micropillar neuromimetic system . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the system can integrate stimuli with a time constant of the order of several hundreds of picoseconds which depends on the recombination times of carriers in the active medium and respond with a macroscopic , excitable pulse if the time delay between the stimuli is shorter than a critical delay . </S>",
    "<S> the critical delay depends on the excitable threshold which is controllable by the amount of pumping of the system . </S>",
    "<S> this system thus simulates the behavior of a leaky integrate - and - fire neuron and is particularity suited for building more advanced processing functionalities . </S>",
    "<S> incoherent and coherent perturbation schemes have been demonstrated , the latter being important to demonstrate cascadability of such excitable systems . as was demonstrated in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> a sufficient number of excitable processing units coupled appropriately is capable of universal computation . </S>",
    "<S> it is however important to keep in mind that even a single unit has also processing capabilities @xcite . in the case of two stimuli </S>",
    "<S> , this system behaves as a fast optical coincidence detector , a functionality that may be of importance in many applications like pattern recognition in optical signals , in analogy to biological systems using these property for sound localization @xcite . </S>"
