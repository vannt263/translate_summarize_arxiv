    "star formation in the early universe should have proceeded in very metal - deficient gas . when the metallicity is lower than @xmath10 , the thermal property of such metal - deficient gas is essentially the same as that of the metal - free gas because cooling by heavy metals is less effective than primordial molecular cooling . among the primordial molecules ,",
    "the importance of h@xmath0 on the star formation in the early universe have been emphasized by many authors because they are the most abundant molecules in metal - free gas .",
    "h@xmath0 molecules provide significant cooling through rotational and vibrational transitions which can lower the gas temperature down to a few hundred k and accordingly reduce the jeans masses to stellar mass scales .",
    "hd molecules are considered to be the second most abundant molecules in primordial gas during the post - recombination era . in spite of its low abundance ( [ hd / h@xmath0 ] @xmath12 )",
    ", hd can provide significant cooling at low temperature gas because hd has higher radiative transition probabilities and lower excitation temperatures than h@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , hd cooling can lower the gas temperature down to @xmath13 100k and accordingly , the jeans mass is also reduced .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the effects of the hd cooling on the formation of stars in very metal - deficient gas , and elucidate the role of hd molecules for the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) there .",
    "our numerical model and method are the same as those of @xcite ( @xcite ) .",
    "we consider an infinitely long cylindrical gas cloud .",
    "we deal with the following 14 species : e , h , h@xmath14 , h@xmath8 , h@xmath0 , h@xmath15 , he , he@xmath14 , he@xmath16 , d , d@xmath14 , d@xmath8 , hd , and hd@xmath14 .    the density is assumed to be uniform along the cylinder axis and the radial distribution",
    "is expressed as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the effective radius , @xmath19 is the central mass density , @xmath20 is the initial gas temperature , @xmath21 is the mean molecular weight , and @xmath22 is the ratio of the gravitational force to the pressure force .",
    "our model is specified by four parameters : @xmath1 , @xmath20 , @xmath22 , and the h@xmath0 abundance @xmath23 .",
    "it should be noted that a higher @xmath2 can be translated to a higher electron abundance of a parent cloud .",
    "this is because when the ionization degree of the parent cloud is higher , the h@xmath0 molecules form more efficiently via radiative reactions of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we take into account the following thermal processes : ( 1 ) h cooling by radiative recombination , collisional ionization , and collisional excitation , ( 2 ) h@xmath0 line cooling , ( 3 ) cooling by h@xmath0 collisional dissociation , ( 4 ) heating by h@xmath0 formation , and ( 5 ) hd line cooling .",
    "in this section , we examine the collapse of the filaments , taking into account the h@xmath0 and hd cooling .",
    "as shown below , there is a critical initial h@xmath0 abundance , above which hd cooling predominantly regulates the cloud evolution .",
    "also , it is found that the hd cooling does not play an important role for high - density gas .",
    "thus , the evolution of the primordial filaments is classified into three cases , depending upon the initial density and initial h@xmath0 abundance ; ( 1 ) low - density filaments with high h@xmath0 abundance , ( 2 ) low - density filaments with low h@xmath0 abundance , and ( 3 ) high - density filaments .    for low density filaments with @xmath26 ,",
    "hd cooling overwhelms h@xmath0 cooling during the contraction , and the temperature descends down to @xmath27 k accordingly . when the density reaches a critical density of hd ( @xmath28 @xmath4 ) , the cloud contraction tends to become quasistatic .",
    "thus , the fragmentation will take place after that stage . for low density filaments with @xmath29 ,",
    "because of the low @xmath30 , the temperature stays a relatively high value at a few hundred k , and hd cooling does not play a role during the contraction .",
    "the contraction proceeds quasi - statically after the density reaches the critical density of h@xmath0 ( @xmath31 @xmath4 ) . as for high density filaments with @xmath32 @xmath4 ,",
    "the temperature stays at a relatively high value because both h@xmath0 and hd cooling is saturated , and therefore hd does not play a significant role for the thermal evolution .",
    "the contraction of such a high - density filament is accelerated by the effective three - body h@xmath0 formation when the density reaches @xmath33 @xmath4 .",
    "then , the fragmentation is not expected to take place until the cloud becomes opaque to h@xmath0 lines at the density of @xmath34 @xmath4 .     and",
    "( b ) @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "the abscissa and ordinate denote the initial central density and the parameter @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the solid lines denote the contours of the fragment mass which are labeled with adjacent numbers .",
    "the dashed lines show the lines at which the hd cooling rate is equal to h@xmath0 cooling rate at the epoch of fragmentation . in the left regions of the dashed lines ,",
    "hd cooling is more efficient than h@xmath0 cooling . ]",
    "figures [ fig:1]a and [ fig:1]b show the distributions of the fragment mass derived from the 1d simulations ( see @xcite ( @xcite ) for more detail ) .",
    "for the models with @xmath36 ( figures [ fig:1]a ) , the mass distribution of the fragments is quite similar to the case without hd ( paper ii ) , because hd cooling does not play an important role in the thermal evolution of the filaments .",
    "there is a steep boundary at @xmath37 @xmath4 in the mass distribution of the fragments for @xmath38 .",
    "for the models with @xmath32 @xmath4 , the fragment masses take their minima at @xmath39 m@xmath40 , whereas , for the models with @xmath3 @xmath4 , they are greater than @xmath41 m@xmath40 .",
    "[ for the models with low densities ( @xmath42 @xmath4 ) , the contraction becomes quasistatic when the density reaches the critical density of h@xmath0 and then linear density fluctuations can grow nonlinearly before the three - body h@xmath0 formation becomes dominant ( @xmath43 @xmath4 ) .",
    "in contrast , for the models with high densities ( @xmath44 @xmath4 ) , the contraction time does not exceed the fragmentation time until the h@xmath0 lines become optically thick at @xmath45 @xmath4 . ]",
    "this sensitivity in the fragment mass comes from the rapid increase in @xmath30 due to the three - body reactions .    on the other hand , when @xmath46 , hd cooling is more effective than h@xmath0 cooling for low - density filaments .",
    "thus , the maximum mass of low - density region reduces to a few tens m@xmath40 .",
    "the minimum mass does not change because hd is not a dominant coolant in the evolution of dense filaments .",
    "therefore , similarly to the models with low @xmath2 the dependence of the fragment mass on @xmath1 exhibits a steep boundary around @xmath47 @xmath4 for @xmath38 .",
    "the existence of a steep boundary in the mass distribution implies that the imf is likely to be bimodal if both low - density and high - density filaments bear stars .",
    "the low - mass peak is around a few @xmath48 , which is not sensitive to the abundance of h@xmath0 formed in a parent cloud .",
    "the high - mass peak is @xmath49 if @xmath50 , while it is @xmath51 if @xmath52 . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss some implications of such bimodal imf in the very metal - deficient gas .",
    "recently , @xcite ( @xcite ) investigated the pancake collapse of pregalactic clouds under uv background radiation .",
    "they found that once the pancaking disk is shielded against external uv radiation , the h@xmath0 molecules form efficiently via h@xmath8 reaction with abundant free electrons produced by uv background , and the resultant abundance reaches @xmath53 .",
    "the pancake disks probably fragment into filaments in which stars would form . in this case",
    ", hd cooling is expected to become efficient in low - density filaments and then , the high mass peak of the imf would go down to @xmath54 10 m@xmath40 .",
    "the time - decreasing uv background radiation is also likely to influence star formation in dwarf galaxies which may be related to excess number count of faint blue objects observed in the hubble deep field .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) studied the effects of the declined uv background on the thermal evolution of the protogalaxies .",
    "they found that there is a critical redshift of @xmath55 , below which the declined uv radiation is shielded by the gas disks where the h@xmath0 abundance reaches @xmath56 owing to high ionization degree by the uv radiation .",
    "the enhanced h@xmath0 formation promotes a rapid transition toward the cold h i phase with @xmath41 k. thus , in such dwarf galaxies , high mass peak of the imf would decrease to @xmath54 10 m@xmath40 owing to hd cooling .",
