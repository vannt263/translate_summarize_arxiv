    "what role does the environment play in the evolution of cluster galaxies ?",
    "the observation that the morphological mix of galaxies varies in different nearby environments was qualitatively noted even in the early studies of the virgo cluster by hubble and humason ( 1931 ) and has been confirmed in many studies ( e.g. , oemler 1974 ; dressler 1980 ; postman & geller 1984 ; dressler et al .",
    "in addition , many studies of nearby galaxies have detailed how cluster galaxies differ from field galaxies within the same hubble type , including redder colors ( kennicutt 1983a ; oemler 1992 ) , less hi gas ( chamaraux , balkowski , & grard 1980 ; giovanelli & haynes 1983 ) , and truncated outer hi gas disks ( giovanelli & haynes 1983 ; warmels 1988 ; cayatte et al . 1990 ) . studies of higher redshift cluster galaxies show that evolution in cluster galaxy morphology and star formation properties has occurred over the last several billion years .",
    "butcher & oemler ( 1978 ) showed that distant clusters of galaxies have a higher proportion of blue galaxies .",
    "more recently , dressler et al . (",
    "1997 ) found an excess of spirals and a lack of s0 galaxies in about the same proportion in dense clusters at redshifts of 0.5 compared to local dense clusters .",
    "these results suggest that many of the s0 s in local clusters were actively star - forming spirals at z=0.5 .",
    "there is a rich literature about the types of environmental processes which could affect the evolution of galaxies in clusters .",
    "there are processes which affect mainly the gaseous content of a galaxy , such as icm - ism interactions ( reviewed by van gorkom 2004 ) , starvation ( larson , tinsley , and caldwell 1980 ) , and gas accretion ( kenney et al . , in prep ) .",
    "gravitational processes , which affect both the gaseous and stellar properties of a galaxy , range from low - velocity tidal interactions and mergers , to high velocity interactions between galaxies and/or the cluster ( reviewed by struck 1999 and mihos 2004 ) . despite a number of recent studies of nearby and distant clusters , it is not yet clear which processes , if any , are dominant . indeed",
    "the properties of cluster galaxies may be determined by a variety of environmental interactions over a hubble time ( miller 1988 ; oemler 1992 ; moore et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the rate of ongoing star formation is an important measure of the evolutionary state of a galaxy , and a sensitive indicator of some types of environmental interactions .",
    "previous studies of the star formation rates of cluster galaxies have reached varying and sometimes opposite conclusions .",
    "some authors have found reduced star formation rates in clusters ( kennicutt 1983a ; bicay & giovanelli 1987 ; kodaira et al .",
    "1990 ; moss & whittle 1993 ; abraham et al .",
    "1996 ; balogh et al . 1998 ; koopmann & kenney 1998 ; hashimoto et al .",
    "1998 ; gavazzi et al .",
    "2002 ) , others similar rates ( kennicutt , bothun , & schommer 1984 ; donas et al .",
    "1990 ; gavazzi , boselli , & kennicutt et al .",
    "1991 , gavazzi et al .",
    "1998 ) , and others enhanced rates ( moss & whittle 1993 , 2000 ; bennett & moss 1998 ) .",
    "this confused situation on cluster galaxy star formation rates is one of the motivations for the present work .",
    "in addition , many previous studies of star formation rates have been based on aperture or integrated galaxy spectral observations .",
    "spatial studies of star formation can probe the types of environmental interactions at work in nearby clusters , therefore revealing what may have influenced galaxies in richer clusters earlier in the history of the universe .",
    "this work describes results from an imaging survey of virgo cluster and isolated spiral galaxies in both broadband r and the h@xmath1 emission line .",
    "the intent of this study is to compare the amounts and distributions of massive star formation in virgo cluster galaxies to those of a relatively undisturbed isolated sample of galaxies .",
    "we base our comparisons on the h@xmath1 emission from galaxies , which is a good tracer of the massive star formation rate ( kennicutt 1983b ) in relatively dust - free regions . it can be used to estimate the total star formation rate by making standard assumptions for the initial mass function .",
    "we use the h@xmath1 surface brightness and the h@xmath1 flux normalized by the r flux as distance - independent tracers of the massive star formation rate .",
    "the data we have gathered thus allow a quantitative radial comparison of massive star formation rates in the two environments .",
    "the virgo cluster is a particularly good laboratory to study environmental effects on star formation since it is the nearest moderately rich cluster , it has significant icm , it is dynamically young with a current infall of spirals ( tully & shaya 1984 ) , and its galaxies are subject to a variety of environmental effects .",
    "an important consideration in addressing these issues is the objective comparison of galaxies with different morphologies .",
    "van den bergh ( 1976 ) made the important observation , based on visual inspection of images on plates , that many cluster spiral galaxies have low rates of star formation relative to field spirals , and that the traditional hubble classification does not work well in nearby clusters because the bulge - to - disk ( b / d ) ratio is not well correlated with the disk star formation rate .",
    "koopmann & kenney ( 1998 ) confirmed and quantified this effect , using objective measurements from ccd images , showing that a one - dimensional classification scheme such as the hubble classification is not applied in the same way to field and cluster galaxies , and that it is not adequate to describe the wider range in morphologies of cluster galaxies .",
    "for example , koopmann & kenney find that a significant fraction ( @xmath2 50% ) of virgo cluster spirals classified as sa are small - to - intermediate concentration ( b / d ) galaxies with reduced global star formation rates , presumably due to environmental effects .",
    "this effect contributes to the excess of ` early - type ' spiral galaxies in the virgo cluster and therefore to the local morphology - density relationship .",
    "this paper presents the main results of a program which is published in separate papers .",
    "we present the observational data for the virgo galaxies in koopmann et al .",
    "( 2001 , hereafter pi ) and that for the isolated galaxies in koopmann & kenney ( 2004 , in prep , hereafter pii ) .",
    "these papers include h@xmath1 and r images and radial profiles for all galaxies .",
    "koopmann & kenney ( 1998 ) present comparisons of hubble type and central r concentration for isolated and virgo galaxies .",
    "the present paper concentrates on the massive star formation properties , with comparisons between integrated h@xmath1 fluxes , h@xmath1 radial profiles , and the relative concentrations of h@xmath1 emission .",
    "a comparison of the different types of h@xmath1 morphologies and a discussion of environmental effects is given in koopmann & kenney ( 2004 , hereafter piv ) .",
    "the 55 virgo s0-scd galaxies have @xmath3 @xmath4 -18 ( b@xmath5 @xmath4 13 for an assumed distance of 16 mpc ) and inclinations less than 75@xmath6 .",
    "the sa - scd sample is 95% complete for @xmath3 @xmath7 -19 and 68% complete for @xmath3 @xmath7 -18 , which is about 2 magnitudes fainter than l@xmath8 .",
    "the sb - scd sample is relatively more complete than the sa - sab sample ( 79% and 50% to @xmath3 @xmath7 -18 , respectively ) .",
    "the s0 galaxies observed are 13% of the population to @xmath3 @xmath7 -18 .",
    "since this study was not designed to focus on s0 s , the results for these galaxies will not be extensively discussed .",
    "there is a slight bias toward galaxies with higher iras fluxes in our sample , since a subset of these galaxies ( 75% ) were obtained as part of a study of star formation rates and efficiencies in a larger sample of spiral galaxies ( young et al .",
    "observational and reduction details are discussed in pi .",
    "isolated galaxies were chosen from the nearby galaxies catalog ( tully 1987 ) and gourgoulhon , chamaraux , & fouqu ( 1992 ) to be similar to the virgo cluster sample galaxies in b luminosity , inclination , and distance , but are located in the least dense regions as defined by parameters from tully ( 1987 ) .",
    "the search criteria produced 103 sa - scd galaxies with @xmath0 -18 .",
    "our 24 sa - scd galaxies comprise @xmath2 25% of this sample to @xmath3 @xmath7 -19 and @xmath2 23% to @xmath3 @xmath7 -18 .",
    "the completeness varies as a function of hubble type due to the morphology density relationship , so that s0-s0/a and sa - sab galaxies are observed to higher completeness ( @xmath2 50% to @xmath3 @xmath7 -18 ) than the sb - scd galaxies ( @xmath2 18% to @xmath3 @xmath7 -18 ) .",
    "details of the selection of isolated galaxies are given in pii .",
    "all r observations are calibrated to the standard kron - cousins r filter .",
    "images were flux - calibrated using spectrophotometric standard stars ( massey et al .",
    "extinction coefficients were obtained from landolt standards or from standard extinction curves at kpno and ctio .",
    "continuum - free h@xmath1 images were derived by subtracting scaled r images from the line images .",
    "h@xmath1 in this paper should be read as h@xmath1+[n ii ] , since two [ n ii ] lines ( @xmath9 6584 , 6548 ) are included in the filter and we make no correction .",
    "surface photometry of the r and h@xmath1 images of sample galaxies was performed using an idl - based program ( see pi ) .",
    "r and h@xmath1 profiles were measured assuming a fixed center , inclination , and position angle , with inclination and position angle derived primarily from the outer r isophotes .",
    "identical elliptical annuli were applied in the h@xmath1 and r surface photometry for each galaxy .",
    "isophotal radii , isophotal fluxes , and central light concentrations are calculated from the derived profiles within the idl program .",
    "exponential r disk scalelengths were measured from the profiles using the decomposition routines in the _ fitting programs in iraf / stsdas .",
    "profiles and fitted parameters for individual galaxies are presented in pi and pii .",
    "_    for comparison between galaxies , all surface brightness profiles were corrected to face on assuming complete transparency in the disk , i.e. , by applying the correction 2.5 log _ ( a / b ) to the surface brightness , where _ a / b is the major - to - minor axis ratio .",
    "all future references to isophotal radii or fluxes integrated within an isophotal radius refer to quantities derived from the profiles corrected to face - on .",
    "the assumption of complete transparency is obviously incorrect , especially at inner radii , but since extinction values for other galaxies are poorly known , no corrections were attempted ( see giovanelli et al .",
    "if the extinction properties of virgo cluster and isolated galaxies are similar , there should be no systematic error due to inclination since the virgo cluster and isolated samples span similar inclination ranges .",
    "the most serious errors in h@xmath1 integrated fluxes and radial profiles will occur for highly inclined galaxies .",
    "for example , young et al .",
    "( 1996 ) find that the h@xmath1 surface brightness significantly decreases in the mean with inclination for galaxies with inclinations greater than @xmath2 70@xmath6 .",
    "all galaxies discussed in this paper have an inclination of 75@xmath6 or less , and we find that the measured quantities do not depend on inclination in this range . _ _      outer isophotal radii are direct tracers of the size / luminosity of high surface brightness galaxies and depend relatively little upon disk extinction , since the outer parts of galaxy disks are nearly transparent ( giovanelli et al . 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "thus , we measured the outer isophotal radii at 24 r mag arcsec@xmath10 in order to normalize the profiles of galaxies of different sizes and distances .",
    "the radius at the 24 mag arcsec@xmath10 isophote in r was selected because the signal at this radius dominates the uncertainty in the sky background for most of the sample galaxies .",
    "( the uncertainty in the sky level includes uncertainties due to scattered light , background gradients , and , in some cases , the effects of small frame size . )",
    "the values of @xmath11 in r are similar to @xmath12 in b.    disk scalelengths were also used to normalize radial profiles , and comparisons based on the disk scalelength rather than the isophotal radius produced no significant difference in the results .",
    "we chose to use the isophotal radius instead of the disk scalelength primarily because of the difficulty of fitting bulge and disk models to sample galaxies , particularly in the virgo cluster , which has proportionately more galaxies with complex profiles .",
    "23% ( 13/55 ) of virgo cluster galaxies have derived disk scalelengths which are uncertain by @xmath13 20% , compared to 7% ( 2/29 ) of the isolated sample galaxies ( pi , pii ) .",
    "these numbers include 4 galaxies for which we were unable to derive disk scalelengths due to dominant bulge components ( the virgo galaxy ngc 4383 and the isolated ngc 3414 ) and/or complex profiles ( the virgo galaxy ngc 4586 , which has a brighter outer disk component and the isolated ngc 2090 , which has a lower surface brightness outer disk component ) . of the remaining 11 virgo galaxies with scalelengths",
    "more than 20% uncertain , eight have a higher surface brightness inner disk compared to the fit to the outer disk ( in 3 cases , this appears to be related to a star formation enhancement ) and three have a higher surface brightness outer disk .",
    "in order to compare properties of the two samples , we initially binned galaxies as a function of hubble type .",
    "types were extracted from binggeli , sandage , and tammann ( 1985 , hereafter bst ) , the revised shapley - ames catalog of bright galaxies ( sandage & tammann 1987 , hereafter rsa ) , the carnegie atlas ( sandage & bedke 1994 , hereafter ca ) , and the third reference catalog of bright galaxies ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 , hereafter rc3 ) .",
    "an examination of the cataloged types indicates problems in the application of the hubble system to virgo cluster galaxies .",
    "three virgo sample galaxies were classified by bst as sc / sa or sc / s0 .",
    "several virgo sample galaxies were classified as sc by bst , but sa or s0 by rc3 .",
    "two galaxies ( ngc 4383 , ngc 4694 ) are classified as amorphous by rsa / bst , but as sa and s0 by the rc3 .",
    "a comparison between the bst / rsa / ca and rc3 shows more than a half type difference in classification for 12% of isolated galaxies , but 30% of virgo galaxies . quantitative comparison between objective tracers of hubble criteria",
    "show that even some virgo galaxies which have _ consistent classifications in the two catalogs do not fit the hubble system , particularly small b / d systems consistently classified as sa and sab ( koopmann & kenney 1998 ) .",
    "see also van den bergh ( 1976 ) and bothun ( 1982 ) . _      the r profiles of sample galaxies trace the b / d ratio objectively .",
    "median profiles were derived for each hubble type and environment bin as a function of @xmath11 . a direct comparison between virgo and isolated median profiles for s0-sc morphological types is given in figure  [ rmedtype ] .",
    "interquartile ranges are indicated in the graph with shading .",
    "virgo sa s are less centrally concentrated in the median than isolated sa s .",
    "we show in section  [ rconcsect ] that this result is significant at the 99% level and that it is not caused by a luminosity effect , as is seen in some studies ( e.g. , scodeggio et al .",
    "this comparison between r radial light profiles further illustrates that hubble classifications are not always an indicator of b / d ratio when applied to the complexity of morphologies in a cluster environment .",
    "the comparison of r profiles also allows an examination of the relative surface brightnesses of the sample galaxies .",
    "the extrapolated central surface brightnesses of the disks of the sample galaxies differ by factors of 4 - 16 for different bins , with no statistically significant dependences on either hubble type or environment .",
    "this is consistent with previous results ( e.g. , bothun 1982 ; kent 1985 ) for central disk surface brightnesses derived from model fits .",
    "figure  [ rmedtype ] shows that the virgo sc galaxies tend to have higher surface brightness disks than the isolated galaxies .",
    "while virgo and isolated sc galaxies span the same range in surface brightness , there are proportionally more virgo sc s with higher disk surface brightness .    ]",
    "a quantitative indicator of b / d ratio for galaxies of similar surface brightness is the central r light concentration parameter , which can be measured directly from the r radial profiles and is ideally independent of the star formation characteristics of a galaxy .",
    "the central light concentration used in this work is similar to the parameter used by abraham et al .",
    "( 1994 ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the total flux in r measured within the @xmath11 isophote and @xmath16 is the flux within the 0.3@xmath11 isophote .",
    "the @xmath17 values are computed directly from the surface photometry calculated using fixed center , inclination , and position angle .",
    "therefore the measurement uncertainty is due mainly to uncertainties in the center , inclination , and position angle of the elliptical apertures . for most of the galaxies ,",
    "these uncertainties are less than 5% , which causes a negligible error in @xmath17 ( pi ) .",
    "systematic effects ( discussed in detail by graham et al .",
    "2001 ) are likely more important ; for example , any phenomena ( rings , dust , star formation regions ) which change the shape of a galaxy s r surface brightness profile can influence the measured @xmath17 parameter .",

    "pi provides a comparison of b / d and @xmath17 values .",
    "scodeggio et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find that a near - infrared concentration parameter , defined as the ratio between the radii that contain 75% and 25% of the total light , is strongly dependent on the luminosity of a galaxy , particularly for low luminosity galaxies . as shown in figure  [ magconc ] , we find no strong correlations between @xmath17 and the luminosity of a galaxy , as measured by @xmath18 , the r magnitude within the @xmath11 isophote .",
    "we note that our sample is dominated by massive , luminous galaxies , and that we have a smaller sample of galaxies than scodeggio et al .",
    "as discussed in koopmann & kenney ( 1998 ) , @xmath17 and hubble type are well correlated in the isolated sample , but not in the virgo sample , and this can also be seen in figure  [ magconc ] . in particular , half of the virgo galaxies classified as sa have lower @xmath17 than any of the isolated galaxies classified as sa .",
    "mann - whitney tests show that this result is significant at the 99% level .",
    ", as a function of luminosity , as measured by the absolute r magnitude within the @xmath11 isophotal radius for the isolated ( a ) and virgo ( b ) samples .",
    "symbols indicate hubble type .",
    "three galaxies with classifications of sc / sa or sc / s0 are labeled with asterisks .",
    "we find no strong correlation between the luminosity and @xmath17 for galaxies in this sample .",
    "note that @xmath17 and hubble type are well correlated for the isolated sample , but poorly correlated for the virgo sample , showing that hubble types do not always trace bulge - to - disk ratios in a cluster environment .",
    "[ magconc ] ]    in comparisons between galaxies with different @xmath17 values , we bin into four @xmath17 ranges . these ranges were chosen based on comparisons between hubble type and @xmath17 for the isolated sample , since @xmath17 correlates well with hubble type for the isolated galaxies ( koopmann & kenney 1998 ) and field galaxies in general ( e.g. , kent 1985 ) .",
    "the @xmath17 bins correspond roughly to isolated s0 ( 0.61 @xmath19 0.72 ) , sa ( 0.51 @xmath19 0.60 ) , sb ( 0.38 @xmath20 0.50 ) , and sc ( 0.24 @xmath19 0.37 ) galaxies .",
    "note that the approximately even distribution in hubble type and @xmath17 for the isolated galaxies is due to the selection of galaxies , which was motivated by the need to obtain adequate numbers for statistical comparison of s0-sc galaxies , and not to trace the actual relative field populations , in which sc galaxies far outnumber s0-sa .",
    "in contrast , the virgo sample galaxies are not evenly distributed in @xmath17 , but primarily fall toward lower concentrations .",
    "this is a combined effect due ( i ) to a more complete sample of sc relative to sa galaxies compared to the isolated sample , but also ( ii ) to the fact that several virgo galaxies classified as sa or mixed type have lower central concentration than isolated sa galaxies .",
    "past comparisons of star formation rates in cluster and field galaxies have been most often based on integrated measures of star formation .",
    "we thus begin our analysis of the h@xmath1 images by examining total h@xmath1 fluxes .",
    "total h@xmath1 fluxes were computed from cleaned , sky - subtracted h@xmath1 images , by summing the total flux within an elliptical aperture including all hii regions .",
    "uncertainties in integrated h@xmath1 fluxes due to sky background noise , calibration errors , continuum subtraction errors are typically 20 - 30% .",
    "the dominant component of this uncertainty is the continuum subtraction error .",
    "error bars given in this paper include a 3% typical uncertainty in the continuum subtraction factor , which corresponds to a much larger error in the calculated h@xmath1 flux , especially for galaxies dominated by faint , diffuse emission .",
    "s0 galaxies have the most uncertain h@xmath1 fluxes , since few contain obvious hii regions , and we therefore do not place much emphasis on the analysis of their h@xmath1 properties , although we include them in the plots .    to compare total h@xmath1 fluxes between galaxies , we normalized by the flux in r contained within @xmath11 to obtain the normalized massive star formation rate ( hereafter nmsfr or f@xmath21/f@xmath22 ) .",
    "this quantity is a measure of the total h@xmath1 luminosity per unit red luminosity and is analogous to an equivalent width .",
    "since some readers are more familiar with the equivalent width scale , we provide a conversion between equivalent width , ew , from our h@xmath1 fluxes : @xmath23 this equation was derived based on our isolated sample and is further described in pii .",
    "the ew s derived from this correlation have an uncertainty of 6% due to scatter .",

    "the right y - axis provides the equivalent width scale .",
    "there is a weak correlation for isolated galaxies , but in virgo , the scatter is greater due to reductions in star formation .",
    "a number of virgo spirals have enhanced total and inner nmsfrs compared to the isolated .",

    "so the true difference in star formation rates between the stripped and unstripped galaxies may be less than is indicated in h@xmath1",
    ". any difference should be less in the comparisons within distinct radial bins .",
    "the fact that we see large differences between the virgo and isolated galaxies in the outer radial bins shows clearly that many outer virgo disks are extremely deficient in h@xmath1 .",
    "however , the outer disk contains a smaller fraction of the global star formation rate than is indicated by uncorrected h@xmath1 , and the true global reduction in star formation rate may be less than is indicated by the h@xmath1 results .",
    "tracers of sf which measure dust emission , such as fir , will be subject to the opposite problem of overemphasizing the inner disk .",
    "an improved treatment should use information from both optical and fir emission to estimate the true radial profile of star formation .",
    "classification is inherently subjective and , as we and others have shown in the case of virgo cluster galaxies , can be dangerous and misleading .",
    "objectives measures are generally preferable , but classification can have value , so here we offer some comments on an improved classification for large disk galaxies .",
    "the standard hubble classification scheme , as employed by sandage and devaucouleurs , uses both bulge - to - disk ratio and disk structure ( closely related to disk star formation rate ) .",
    "this system can not work for cluster galaxies because in virgo the bulge - to - disk ratio is poorly correlated with the disk star formation rate .",
    "as pointed out by van den bergh ( 1976 ) , the sa type has become a repository for galaxies with very different physical characteristics .",
    "the van den bergh ( 1976 ) rddo system offers an important step in a more correct approach , by completely separating the spatial distribution of the old stars ( i.e. bulge - to - disk ratio ) from the the spatial distribution of the new stars ( as measured , for example , by h@xmath1 ) .",
    "the three proposed evolutionary stages ( normal spiral , anemic , and lenticular ) are still not sufficient to describe the morphology of approximately half of the virgo spirals in this sample , which have spatially truncated star formation profiles : a normal - enhanced inner disk star formation combined with weak - no outer disk star formation . whereas many isolated and some virgo galaxies might follow an evolutionary progression from normal spiral , through anemic , and then to lenticular , many cluster galaxies will not",
    ".    in broadband images , truncation of the star - forming disks results in a smooth outer disk combined with a clumpy inner disk .",
    "this effect was noticed by van den bergh et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , who called galaxies with this morphology `` virgo types '' .",
    "while this morphology reflects the most frequently occurring type of environmental alteration in the virgo cluster , there are other peculiar morphologies in the virgo cluster , and so we have chosen not to use the term ` virgo - type ' .",
    "we propose that an additional parallel branch could be added to the van den bergh scheme , describing the truncated star formation morphology : sta - stb -stc , where the a - b - c division is based on the central light concentration or b / d .",
    "however , we reemphasize that attempts to characterize galaxy morphologies should be founded on objective measurements rather than subjective visual classification whenever possible .",
    "studies such as conselice ( 2003 ) offer promise for better characterizing galaxy morphologies in terms of a few relatively simple global parameters such as central concentration and asymmetry , which conselice shows are correlated to a galaxy s evolutionary state .",
    "the truncation phenomena , which seems most prevalent in cluster galaxies , should be included in any such objective parameter schemes .",
    "most previous studies of cluster galaxies have been limited to measurements of global star formation .",
    "comparisons between cluster and field samples produce varying results , as documented in the introduction .",
    "it is clear that the star formation activity in the virgo cluster spans a large range .",
    "we find , in agreement with a number of previous multiwavelength studies of virgo ( kennicutt 1983a ; kodaira et al .",
    "1990 ; gavazzi et al .",
    "2002 ) , that the global star formation activity as traced by h@xmath1 has been reduced in the median .",
    "the amount of reduction may well be greater , since our study includes mostly spirals with at least some ongoing star formation activity .",
    "the selection of sample galaxies using the hubble type may also lead to an underestimate in the reduction in star formation , since small - bulge galaxies which have ceased star formation are likely classified as s0 s .",
    "the result that several virgo cluster spirals have enhanced star formation is relatively new for studies of the virgo cluster",
    ". this may be partly due to previous comparison samples .",
    "the kennicutt & kent ( 1983 ) study of h@xmath1 emission in virgo cluster galaxies , for example , used a comparison sample of field galaxies , which included systems in groups , and in particular some starbursts ( e.g. , m82 ) .",
    "thus their study was not especially sensitive to rates of star formation enhanced above those found in isolated galaxies , which we are better able to quantify .",
    "we note that most of the virgo cluster galaxies with enhanced star formation have absolute b magnitudes between -18 and -19 .",
    "this result is probably related to the observation that ` k+a ' and emission - line galaxies in the coma cluster tend to be less luminous than ` k+a ' counterparts at larger redshifts ( poggianti et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the moss & whittle ( 2000 ) study finds a high percentage of starbursting late - type spirals in 8 nearby abell clusters .",
    "however , it is important to note that their survey was not sensitive to reductions in star formation activity because the survey has a rather high lower limit of @xmath40 on the strength of h@xmath1 .",
    "( most of the galaxies in our sample have @xmath41 ) below 20 @xmath42 . )",
    "this means moss & whittle can not detect differences between normal and reduced amounts of star formation , and they can not determine whether the overall star formation rate in their clusters is higher or lower than non - cluster samples .",
    "there are relatively few previous results on the spatial distributions of star formation for galaxies in clusters .",
    "our work shows that most galaxies with reduced star formation in the virgo cluster have truncated star - forming disks , but normal - to - enhanced inner rates .",
    "rotation curve studies ( rubin et al . 1999 ; dale et al .",
    "2001 ) also show the truncated h@xmath1 distributions of cluster galaxies .",
    "dale et al . ( 2001 ) find on average more severely truncated galaxies closer to the cluster core ( see also piv ) .",
    "other studies have found evidence of centrally concentrated star formation morphologies in a number of cluster galaxies , which may be combined with a severe truncation of the star - forming disk .",
    "caldwell et al .",
    "( 1996 ) identified a population of starburst and poststarburst spirals in coma , most of which have centrally concentrated star formation , typically within 1 - 2 kpc ( caldwell et al . 1999 ) .",
    "similar morphology galaxies are found in pegasus i ( rose et al .",
    "these poststarburst galaxies were initially classified as e or s0 , and yet all are spirals and about half have small - intermediate b / d . in a study of the s0 s in coma , poggianti et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found that 40% show spectroscopic evidence for central star formation within the last 5 gyr .",
    "finally , moss & whittle ( 2000 ) find evidence of circumnuclear starbursts in a population of cluster galaxies .",
    "thus , this study and those cited above show that truncated star - forming disks with active inner star formation are prevalent in clusters , but less common in the field , suggesting that they are produced by environmental processing in clusters .      studies of the spatial characteristics of star formation in the virgo and other clusters are especially important because of the clues they provide in investigating the dominant environmental effects on galaxy evolution in clusters . in this section ,",
    "we summarize the implications of this survey on the understanding of environmental effects in the virgo cluster .",
    "a more extensive discussion is given in piv , where we investigate possible relationships between observed h@xmath1 morphologies and environmental effects .",
    "the systematic reduction in the star formation rate in the outer disks of many virgo spirals revealed by this study is in all likelihood due to the systematic removal of gas from the outer disk by the virgo environment .",
    "star formation ceases once the gas falls below a threshold determined by the local dynamics ( kennicutt 1989 ) .",
    "the sharp spatial truncation of the h@xmath1 disks in such a high percentage of virgo cluster galaxies is most naturally explained by gas removal due to icm - ism interactions ( e.g. gunn & gott ; nulsen 1982 ; vollmer et al . 2001 ) . in the case of starvation ( larson et al . 1980 ; balogh , navarro , & morris 2000 ) , i.e. , the stripping of a loosely - bound outer gas reservoir ( by the icm and/or cluster potential field ) , one might expect to see a gradual reduction in star formation across the disk , resulting in a significant fraction of anemic spirals , which we show to be rare in the virgo cluster ( see also piv ) . while tidal interactions may be capable of eventually producing spirals with truncated gas disks",
    "( see for example , kenney et al .",
    "1995 ) and may be important in the evolution of many virgo spirals ( piv ) , it is hard to explain how tidal interactions alone could account for such a large population of galaxies with spatially truncated gas disks .",
    "in addition , we show in piv that many of the galaxies with truncated h@xmath1 disks have regular stellar isophotes .",
    "if icm - ism stripping is an important effect in the virgo cluster , we would expect to see gas- and star - formation - poor galaxies with a continuum of bulge sizes .",
    "our observations show that this is the case ; in particular , we find significant numbers of small to intermediate bulge - to - disk ratio galaxies with truncated star forming disks .    the normal to enhanced star formation rates in the inner galaxy disks of virgo spirals imply that icm - ism interactions have not had a strong effect on the inner regions of most virgo ( star - forming ) galaxies .",
    "the inner star formation rates of even the severely hi deficient spirals are within the bounds of isolated spirals .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that the inner disks of galaxies are h@xmath43-dominated , and that co luminosities are close to normal for virgo galaxies compared to field galaxies ( kenney & young 1989 ) .",
    "apparently the total gas surface density in inner disks is still high enough to allow star formation . while it has been suggested that enhancements in star formation may be caused by icm - ism interactions ( e.g. , dressler & gunn 1983 ; gavazzi et al .",
    "2001 ) , it appears that our sample galaxies with enhanced global and inner disk star formation have been more strongly affected by processes other than icm - ism stripping ( piv ) .",
    "thus the results of this survey support the conclusion that icm - ism interactions play a significant role in the evolution of many virgo cluster spirals , by preferentially stripping gas from the outer disk .",
    "more detailed study of the h@xmath1 morphologies presented in piv supports this conclusion and also indicates that tidal encounters and mergers are also important in explaining the optical and kinematical peculiarities ( e.g. , rubin et al .",
    "1999 ) of a number of virgo cluster spirals .",
    "the results of this survey of star formation rates and morphologies of virgo cluster spirals compared to isolated spirals include the following :    \\1 .",
    "h@xmath1-based estimates of the total massive star formation rates of virgo cluster galaxies span a range from strongly reduced ( up to 10 times ) to enhanced ( up to 2.5 times ) compared to the isolated sample . in the median ,",
    "virgo total star formation rates are reduced by factors up to 2.5 for different hubble types and concentrations .",
    "\\2 . for most virgo cluster galaxies with reduced total star formation , it is truncation rather than anemia ( low h@xmath1 surface brightness across the disk ) which causes the reduced total star formation rates .",
    "median inner rates are similar or enhanced up to a factor of 1.7 , while outer star formation rates are reduced in the median by factors of 1.5 - 9 . in the outermost parts of the optical disks , star formation of all types and concentrations of galaxies",
    "are reduced by factors greater than 3 times in the median .",
    "reductions in individual galaxies range to factors greater than 100 .",
    "no galaxies have star formation rates in the outer half of the disk enhanced above isolated rates .",
    "thus , most galaxies with reduced total star formation have inner star formation rates which are similar to or enhanced with respect to isolated galaxies of similar central light concentration or hubble type .",
    "virgo cluster galaxies have more concentrated star forming disks than isolated counterparts , largely due to truncation .",
    "the larger mean hi deficiency of virgo cluster sa s as compared to cluster sb and sc s ( solanes et al 2001 ) is predominantly due to strongly stripped galaxies being classified as sa s , rather than galaxies with large bulge - to - disk ratios being preferentially stripped .",
    "one reason for the previously observed systematic difference in spatial distributions and kinematics between early- and late - type virgo spirals ( dressler 1986 ) is that stripped spirals , which are preferentially on radial orbits ( solanes et al 2001 ) , tend to be misleadingly _ classified as early - types .",
    "likewise , the excess of sa galaxies in the virgo cluster , and perhaps by extension other clusters , is in large part due to strongly stripped galaxies being classified as sa s , and is not simply an excess of spiral galaxies with large bulge - to - disk ratios . _",
