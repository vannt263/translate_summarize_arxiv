    "<S> using numerical simulations we show that a variety of novel colloidal crystalline states and multi - step melting phenomena occur on square and triangular two - dimensional periodic substrates . at half - integer fillings different kinds of frustration effects </S>",
    "<S> can be realized . </S>",
    "<S> a two - step melting transition can occur in which individual colloidal molecules initially rotate , destroying the overall orientational order , followed by the onset of interwell colloidal hopping , in good agreement with recent experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> colloidal particles are an ideal system for studying 2d ordering and melting for different kinds of substrates as the individual particle positions and dynamics can be directly visualized . </S>",
    "<S> crystallization and melting on 2d periodic substrates is also relevant to vortices in superconductors with periodic pinning arrays @xcite and atomic orderings @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> colloidal crystallization on 2d periodic substrates has been the subject of considerable recent interest . </S>",
    "<S> in several recent experimental studies , a 2d substrate for colloids was created using optical tweezer arrays @xcite , templating @xcite , and 2d crossed laser arrays @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> colloidal ordering and melting on 2d periodic square and triangular substrates has been studied through simulation @xcite and experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that a rich variety of novel colloidal crystalline states , referred to as colloidal molecular crystals ( cmc s ) , form at integer filling of the periodic substrates .    in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , integer matching states up through a filling of four colloids per minima were illustrated for both square and triangular arrays , and the two - stage melting behavior of the dimer state at a filling of two colloids per minima was demonstrated for the square substrate . </S>",
    "<S> here , we present the structures observed at half - integer filling for the square and triangular substrates , showing that the perfect regularity of the integer filling state is destroyed away from integer filling . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate a two - stage melting transition for the trimer state at a filling of three colloids per minima for the square substrate .    we simulate a 2d system of @xmath0 colloids with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 directions , using langevin dynamics as employed in previous colloidal simulations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the overdamped equation of motion for a colloid @xmath3 is    @xmath4    here @xmath5 is the interaction force from the other colloids . the colloid - colloid interaction is a yukawa or screened coulomb potential , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the charge of the particles , @xmath8 is the screening length , and @xmath9 is the position of particle @xmath3 ( @xmath10 ) . the system length is measured in units of the lattice constant @xmath11 and we take the screening length @xmath12 . for the force from the 2d substrate , we consider both square and triangular substrates with strength a , period @xmath11 , and @xmath13 minima . for square substrates , @xmath14 , and for triangular substrates , @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> $ ] , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal force @xmath20 is a randomly fluctuating force from random kicks . </S>",
    "<S> we start the system at a temperature where all the colloids are diffusing rapidly and gradually cool to @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> we do not take into account hydrodynamic effects or possible long - range attractions between colloids .    </S>",
    "<S> the colloidal positions for a system with a square substrate at integer matching between the colloidal periodicity and the substrate periodicity , @xmath22 , are illustrated in fig . 1 of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for @xmath23 to 4 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , at @xmath24 , each colloid is located at the center of the potential minima and a square colloidal crystal forms , while at @xmath25 , each minima captures two colloids which can be regarded as a colloidal dimer with a rotational degree of freedom . over a range of substrate strengths , the colloidal dimers form a rotationally ordered state , with neighboring dimers perpendicular to one another . </S>",
    "<S> the orientational ordering of the dimers is due to the colloidal repulsion , and allows the distance between the colloids to be maximized under the constraint of the square substrate . in fig . 1 </S>",
    "<S> , we show the colloidal positions for the square substrate system at a half - integer filling , @xmath26 . here </S>",
    "<S> we find a combination of the single colloids and dimer colloids . </S>",
    "<S> the single colloids are located at every other site with intervening dimers , creating a checkerboard ordering . </S>",
    "<S> the strong orientational ordering of the dimers observed at @xmath25 is lost in this state . </S>",
    "<S> the dimers alternate their orientation between vertical and horizontal in a disordered fashion , forming a pattern of grain boundaries .    </S>",
    "<S> the ordered colloidal crystalline states that form on a triangular substrate at integer matching from @xmath27 to 4 are illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . as in the case of the square substrate , at @xmath28 </S>",
    "<S> each minima captures a single colloid , while at @xmath29 each minima captures two colloids which form a dimer state . </S>",
    "<S> the dimers again have an additional orientational ordering in which the dimers in each row have the same orientation , which is rotated @xmath30 with respect to the adjacent rows . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 we illustrate the colloidal positions for the triangular substrate at half - integer filling , @xmath31 . unlike the square substrate , where dimers could tile the lattice in an orderly way , filling every other minima , for the triangular substrate the positioning of the dimers is frustrated . </S>",
    "<S> it is not possible to arrange a state such that minima with only one colloid will be between every other dimer . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the colloids form a very disordered state in which the dimers show a wide range of orientations , and not merely two as in the case of the square substrate at @xmath31 , or the triangular substrate at @xmath29 .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 we show the two - stage melting of the cmc at @xmath32 on the square lattice . as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) at low temperatures @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 is the melting temperature at zero substrate strength ) , both orientational and translational order of the trimers are present and the system is frozen . </S>",
    "<S> this is the `` ordered solid '' phase . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) , at @xmath35 , the trimers begin to rotate within the minima ; however , diffusion of individual colloids throughout the sample does not occur . </S>",
    "<S> the system is still frozen but the trimer orientational order is lost . </S>",
    "<S> this is the `` partially ordered solid '' phase . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(c ) , for a higher temperature @xmath36 , the system enters a modulated liquid phase . here </S>",
    "<S> the colloids begin to diffuse throughout the system . </S>",
    "<S> we note that in the recent experiments of brunner and bechinger @xcite , the same melting phenomena was also found for trimers on a triangular substrate .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown the rich variety of novel colloidal crystalline and disordered states that can be achieved with square and triangular two - dimensional substrates . </S>",
    "<S> the colloidal molecular crystal states that appear at integer filling of the substrate minima persist at half - integer filling , appearing as a mixture of the two neighboring integer filling states . </S>",
    "<S> for the case of @xmath31 , the single and dimer states coexist . </S>",
    "<S> an ordered filling of dimers can be arranged on the square substrate at @xmath31 , but the dimer arrangement is frustrated on the triangular substrate and a strongly disordered state results . </S>",
    "<S> the triangular lattice at @xmath31 is thus a realization of a frustrated system which would provide an interesting topic for further study . for integer filling of @xmath32 on a square substrate </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate the multistage melting of the cmc , where the orientational order of the colloidal molecule states is lost first , followed by the translational order . </S>",
    "<S> since the colloids within a minima can act as a single particle with a rotational degree of freedom , our results also suggest that certain canonical statistical mechanics models , such as ising , @xmath37 , potts , and frustrated models , may be realized with colloids on two - dimensional periodic substrates . </S>",
    "<S> the states predicted here should be observable for colloids interacting with crossed - laser arrays or optical tweezer arrays , dusty plasmas in 2d with periodic potentials , and vortices in superconductors with periodic substrates . </S>"
