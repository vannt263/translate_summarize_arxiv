    "during recent years substantial progress has been made in cold atom experiments . among the greatest achievements are the experimental realization of the superfluid to mott insulating transition with bosonic atoms in optical lattices @xcite and the bec to bcs crossover in fermionic quantum gases @xcite . due to the good tunability the excitement to use cold atomic gases as a so - called quantum simulator has been hard to temper .",
    "such quantum simulators are systems which mimic  in a controllable and ultraclean way  simple strongly - interacting models such as the hubbard model . with ultracold atom experiments",
    "the dream of using such quantum simulators to obtain new insight into the long - standing problems of other research areas seems ` almost ' feasible .",
    "one of the notorious challenges of condensed matter physics that might be solved in such quantum simulations is the fermionic hubbard model @xcite , believed to be relevant for high temperature superconductivity @xcite .    beside the use as quantum simulators ,",
    "the unprecedented tunability of cold atomic systems makes them very promising candidates for quantum computers .",
    "the experimental production of entanglement has been a large step forward into performing quantum computations  @xcite .",
    "the prerequisite of applying the quantum simulator to unknown physics , is a complete understanding of the present experiments .",
    "one would expect full agreement between the current generation of bosonic experiments and theory , since the properties of the underlying homogeneous bose - hubbard model are rather well studied . however , our understanding of the present experiments is far from complete .",
    "the interpretation of the results is mainly complicated by two points :    * the presence of an external trapping potential can cause the spatial coexistence of the superfluid and mott phases .",
    "this replaces the quantum phase transition by a gradual crossover , which can obscure the characteristic signal of the quantum phases .",
    "* a change in temperature due to adiabatic or non - adiabatic origins can also hide the signature of the quantum phase transition , replacing it by a thermal transition .",
    "considerable heating in current experiments would cast serious doubt  @xcite on former interpretations .",
    "knowledge of the temperature in an optical lattice is therefore highly desirable , but whereas the temperature of a weakly - interacting bosonic gas in a parabolic trap can be measured accurately , no reliable temperature measurement exists in the presence of a deep optical lattice .    in this manuscript",
    "we reexamine the interpretation of recent experiments of bosons in optical lattices focusing on the effect of temperature in the presence of a trapping potential .",
    "we determine the lowest temperature that can be reached by loading the atoms adiabatically into the optical lattice .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that such processes are isolated and close to thermodynamic equilibrium at all times , since ramping up the lattice is typically slow ( @xmath0 ms per increase @xmath1 in lattice laser intensity ) compared to the tunneling rate of the bosons ( @xmath2 khz , except for the deepest lattices )  @xcite .",
    "this assumption gives a lower bound for the temperature which can be achieved in the experiments without applying further cooling techniques .",
    "we compare the results of our approach with the measured experimental interference patterns over the whole parameter range .",
    "in contrast to previous work @xcite , we can take the full range of realistic heights of the lattice potential and the full trapping potential into account and our calculations are approximation - free and based on first principles .",
    "after introducing the theoretical description of the quantum gas in section [ sec : model ] , we discuss the quantum monte carlo methods we developed in section [ sec : methods ] .",
    "this section can be skipped by the non - expert . in section [ sec : onedim ] we present results for the entropy in one dimension .",
    "we compare homogeneous systems with systems in the presence of realistic trapping potentials across the superfluid to mott - insulating transition and we also study the tonks - giradeau gas .",
    "we make contact with analytic approximations where possible , and we study the validity of the local density approximation . section  [ sec : twodim ] is dedicated to the entropy in two - dimensional homogeneous and trapped systems .",
    "we study the influence of the trapping potential , density , temperature , and of the actual experimental procedure on the visibility in section  [ sec : visibility ] .",
    "we also compare the visibility obtained computationally with experimental data .",
    "in order to prepare ultracold atoms into an optical lattice , the atoms are confined in an external trapping potential and cooled till they bose - einstein condense .",
    "thereafter , additional lasers forming an optical lattice are turned on .",
    "one gradually increases the intensity of these lasers , slowly enough to remain in a low - energy state but also fast enough such that external influences are small .",
    "adiabaticity can be checked by reversing the process , i.e. decreasing the intensity and comparing the state at a certain lattice height shows the same experimental signature as the corresponding state while switching on the lattice .",
    "such experiments indicate that the loading of the atoms might to a good approximation be considered as adiabatic .",
    "atoms loaded in a sufficiently deep optical lattice are described by the bose - hubbard model  @xcite , @xmath3 the notation @xmath4 refers to the sum over nearest - neighbor sites only .",
    "bosons are created on site @xmath5 by the operator @xmath6 and the number of bosons on site @xmath5 is counted by the number operator @xmath7 .",
    "the kinetic term describes hopping of the bosons with tunneling amplitude @xmath8 , while the on - site repulsion has strength @xmath9 .",
    "we will work in the canonical ensemble with a constant number of particles , @xmath10 .",
    "the linear system size is @xmath11 and we work in dimensions @xmath12 .",
    "we restrict ourselves to a single - band bose - hubbard model , which is sufficient at low temperatures and lattice intensities around the superfluid - mott transition , but it becomes approximative for very low repulsion or high temperatures .    the external trapping potential is included using @xmath13 , where @xmath14 describes the strength of the trapping and @xmath15 the distance to the center of the lattice .",
    "if red detuned lasers are applied for creating the optical lattice potential the focusing of the lasers gives rise to an additional confinement . under proper alignment of the two trapping potentials ,",
    "the total trapping is given by @xmath16  @xcite with @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the waist of the lattice laser beam and @xmath19 its intensity expressed in single - photon recoil energies , @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 is the wavelength of the lattice laser beam and @xmath22 is the mass of the atoms .",
    "we took the waists isotropic and neglected corrections of the order of @xmath23 .",

    "( [ eq : laser_waist ] ) dominates already for moderately strong lattices .",
    "the homogeneous bose - hubbard system shows a quantum phase transition from a superfluid to a mott insulating state when the filling is commensurate  @xcite .",
    "the transition occurs at @xmath24  @xcite in one - dimensional systems , and at @xmath25  @xcite in two - dimensional systems .",
    "whereas in the superfluid state a continuous excitation spectrum exists at low energies , the mott - insulator is characterized by a gap just above its ground state .",
    "analytically the entropy in the bose - hubbard model has been studied for non - interacting @xcite and weakly interacting @xcite bosons .",
    "the strongly interacting limit for the mott - insulator and the tonks regime have been considered for homogeneous @xcite and trapped systems @xcite . in three dimensions , the entropy deep in the superfluid and mott insulating phases was calculated using effective masses  @xcite .",
    "information on the trapped system was then obtained using the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "the bose - hubbard model can only be solved analytically in these limiting cases , where one is very deep in the superfluid or mott insulating phase .",
    "close to the phase transition numerical tools have to be employed , such as the qmc simulations performed here .",
    "in this chapter we discuss a number of methods to determine the entropy @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the total ( internal ) energy of the system , @xmath28 the inverse temperature and @xmath29 is the free energy .",
    "we use @xmath30 .",
    "the main challenge is an accurate calculation of the partition function .",
    "it turns out that a combination of two methods discussed below gives the best results .",
    "both are accurate , and do not involve any fitting nor noisy derivatives of numerical data , but they are efficient in a different temperature range .",
    "the results of both methods have been checked against each other for consistency . the flat histogram methods ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : qwl ] ) works best at high temperatures , while the thermodynamic integration method ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : tdintegration ] ) works better at low temperatures .",

    "an efficient updating scheme has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and allows the straightforward computation of the kinetic and potential energy , density , compressibility , equal time green function , and superfluid density",
    ". however , the partition function is not a thermodynamic average and is harder to compute .",
    "the goal of a flat histogram method is to obtain a density of states @xmath40 ( where the coordinate @xmath41 in classical simulations is usually the energy ) directly by a random walk in @xmath41-space instead of performing a canonical simulation at fixed temperature . by sampling each value of @xmath41 with a probability @xmath42",
    "we obtain a flat ( constant ) histogram @xmath43 in the wang - landau sampling scheme @xcite , a crude guess for @xmath44 is iteratively updated until it converges by a multiplicative factor @xmath45 . during consecutive wang - landau iterations , @xmath45 is reduced according to @xmath46 when the current histogram @xmath47 is considered to be sufficiently flat .",
    "then the histogram is reset , we have a more accurate estimator for the density of states , and the sampling restarts with the smaller @xmath45 .",
    "the convergence of the scheme was proven by zhou and bhatt  @xcite .",
    "in particular , they showed that the minimum number of steps in each wang - landau iteration should scale as @xmath48 .",
    "the generalization of the wang - landau scheme to quantum systems was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here , we generalize eq .",
    "( 4 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite to the path - integral formulation : @xmath49 the expansion order @xmath50 corresponds to the number of kinks ( particle hoppings ) present in the path integral representation of a configuration .",
    "the original partition function ( which is a function of the inverse temperature @xmath51 ) can be found back by setting @xmath52 .",
    "the density of states @xmath53 corresponds to @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the weight of a diagonal configuration , @xmath56 in such configurations all world - lines are continuous , and it occurs during the monte carlo run when the two open ends ( worms ) cancel each other on the same site and imaginary time .    using the canonical worm algorithm @xcite",
    ", the density of states can be obtained as follows : a single monte carlo step is defined from a diagonal to a new diagonal configuration and has an acceptance factor @xmath57 .",
    "taking the density of states into account , the acceptance factor should be modified to @xmath58,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the density of states corresponding to the expansion order of the old configuration @xmath60 . when the expansion order of the new configuration is larger than a predefined maximum expansion order , the update is rejected .",
    "when the wang - landau iteration is finished , we can obtain the partition function for all values of @xmath21 .",
    "for the bose - hubbard model that means that we obtain a whole set of partition functions through the scaling @xmath61 ( thus @xmath62 is constant ) .",
    "a trap would also rescale as @xmath63 , which makes this scaling less useful in the trapped case and we use it just to obtain values at @xmath64 .",
    "if we had worked in the grand - canonical ensemble , the chemical potential would scale analogously , and we lose all control over the particle number .",
    "here we see a distinct advantage of the canonical ensemble over the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "the normalization of @xmath53 is fixed by calculating the partition function @xmath65 in the canonical ensemble for the case without hopping ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the second method we discuss is the thermodynamic integration method .",
    "we choose a set of inverse temperatures @xmath67 then the partition function can be written as @xmath68 the partition function at infinitely hot temperatures @xmath69 can be found by solving the combinatorial problem of placing @xmath10 bosons on @xmath11 lattice sites , @xmath70 the ratios in eq .",

    "we can thus compute the partition function at @xmath73 if we know the partition function at @xmath77 .",
    "the accuracy of the scheme depends on the overlap between the system at @xmath73 and the one at @xmath77 .",
    "if the overlap is small , the error on the partition function will increase rapidly and propagate systematically on to lower temperatures .",
    "in particular the first term @xmath78 should be chosen sufficiently close to zero , since there are only contributions if the expansion order is zero .",
    "the fluctuations in the ( diagonal ) energy in eq .",
    "( [ eq : int_weightsratio ] ) are exponentially hard to control .",
    "we therefore choose our set of values of @xmath51 such that @xmath79 . at large values of @xmath9 or large particle numbers , more @xmath51-points are required .",
    "when we are close to the ground state things get easier since there energy fluctuations are suppressed . in the limit that @xmath80 is infinitely small , the scheme reduces to an energy integration .",
    "note however that the scheme remains exact when @xmath80 is finite .",
    "although we tried a number of alternatives , none of them were satisfactory .",
    "we briefly make some remarks about them .",
    "we tried to use @xmath81 and integrate the density fluctuation with respect to inverse temperature , but the scatter of the data was much bigger than the trend - line , which made this approach prohibitive without an adequate fitting procedure . integrating the specific heat @xmath82[eq : int_spec_heat ] after differentiating the fitted curve through the energy was used in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , the division by the temperature is misbehaving at low @xmath83 and the specific heat computed via the fluctuation formula @xmath84 is a quantity that converges slowly in the monte carlo simulation .",
    "we have also combined a grand - canonical directed loop algorithm in the path - integral representation @xcite ) with a quantum wang - landau reweighting scheme , though the fact that the wang - landau reweighting also changes the density , made this approach very cumbersome .",
    "a better attempt was developing a canonical directed - loop algorithm in the stochastic series expansion @xcite and combining it with a quantum wang - landau reweighting scheme .",
    "this approach has the advantage that one obtains all temperatures down to the one corresponding to the pre - chosen cut - off length at once .",
    "the drawback is that in a sse representation the large values of @xmath9 are also sampled , requiring extremely large orders even for moderate temperatures .",
    "we obtained the highest accuracy by combining the two methods outlined in detail above .",
    "for high temperatures , up to @xmath85 , the combination of the canonical worm algorithm with the flat histogram ( qwl ) scheme is best and fast . for larger",
    "@xmath86 , and since we are interested in the entropy for a very large number of @xmath86 over a relatively small temperature range , thermodynamic integration is best .",
    "this method should only be used close to the ground state . otherwise the fluctuations in eq .",

    "when starting from a low temperature , we see almost no heating in units of @xmath8 up to @xmath89 . the initially low entropy can be distributed over the remaining superfluid regions .",
    "measuring the temperature in units of @xmath9 leads to a cooling of the system below the value of @xmath89 .",
    "in contrast , for interaction strengths larger than @xmath89 almost the whole system is occupied by a commensurate region and the incommensurate regions have a negligible volume fraction .",
    "the energy cost to generate an excitation in this situation corresponds in the bulk to the large interaction energy and at the boundaries to the large potential energy cost resulting from the steep trapping potential .",

    "note that the description by the one - band hubbard model breaks down at such high temperatures .",
    "one of the standard experimental observation techniques consists of suddenly switching off the confinement and taking absorption images of the freely expanding gas after a finite flight time .",
    "the hereby resulting interference pattern is a reflection of the initial momentum distribution , @xmath92 where the factor @xmath93 is the fourier transform of the wannier function @xcite .",
    "the use of the momentum profiles ( and also of the visibilities ) has been subject to debate , since in this quantity different effects as heating or the loss of coherence by stronger interactions have the same consequence .",
    "furthermore , it is very difficult to extract information on the superfluid - mott insulator transition point from these measurements in a trapping potential @xcite .",
    "this is due to the spatially coexisting regions of superfluid and mott - insulating character .",

    "taking the steepening of the trap into account we see that at low values of @xmath91 the visibility is higher than the one obtained with the constant trapping for the considered particle number .",

    "the experimentalists extracted the coherent fraction of the atoms by taking the ratio of the content in the interference peaks and the background .",
    "we compared ( not shown ) the experimental data with the theoretical calculations where we treated the results for the momentum distribution in the same way .",
    "we found the same order of magnitude and the same qualitative trends ( e.g. , the visibility for low lattice heights is between 0.5 and 0.6 in both cases ) .",
    "a detailed comparison however is hindered by the presence of many different parallel tubes in the experiments and by the large uncertainties stemming from the difficulty to fit the very sharp interference peaks .",
    "an interpretation of experimental results on the superfluid to mott insulator transition taking finite temperature effects into account has been given before by several authors , with differing conclusions .",
    "we have addressed the possibility of adiabatic temperature changes when ramping up the lattice for a bose - hubbard model using unbiased and first - principle quantum monte carlo simulations .",
    "we find that the expressions heating and cooling have to be taken with care , since they strongly depend on the unit in which temperature is measured .    for the homogeneous case , we found some small heating in units of @xmath8 near commensurability in the superfluid phase for high temperatures @xmath134 . for low temperatures",
    ", there is some small heating for low values of @xmath135 , but the system cools slightly for larger values of @xmath91 when we are in the proximity of commensurability . at very low densities , temperature remains almost constant in the superfluid phase .",
    "when the density is commensurate , the temperature shoots up dramatically in units of @xmath8 when the mott gap opens in order to keep the accessible number of levels constant .",
    "this is in agreement with the findings of previous studies @xcite .    in a trapped system",
    "however the situation is different as already noted in @xcite for hard - core bosons .",
    "we find that in a one- and a two - dimensional system in a trapping potential the main entropy contribution comes from incommensurate regions with low filling @xmath136 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the finding for a three - dimensional system of the amherst group where they find that the non - commensurate edges between the mott plateaus become normal and accommodate the entropy  @xcite .",
    "we found that the temperature increased in units of @xmath8 when the size of the commensurate regions is broader than several lattice sites in the case of constant trapping .",
    "for realistic trapping and densities around one or two , we found a temperature increase in units of @xmath8 , even in the weakly interacting regime .",
    "however , in units of @xmath9 temperature decreases or saturates , and its value lies deep in the quantum regime for the commensurate regions .",
    "only if the incommensurate regions around filling @xmath136 are almost totally suppressed the entropy has to be taken by excitations in the commensurate regions or regions with higher filling , by which the mott - insulating regions might be destroyed .",
    "our result is in agreement with the results of f. gerbier who finds that current experiments easily reach the thermal insulator regime ( @xmath137 , where mott - like features persist but superfluidity is absent ) , and possibly the quantum region  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite , we find that for realistic paramters no runaway temperature occurs .",
    "assuming adiabaticity in current experiments is in agreement with theory remaining in the quantum regime .",
    "in particular , the drop in the visibility of the interference pattern can be fully explained within this framework and no additional temperature rise has to be taken into account .",
    "future experiments using the spatially resolved measurements of the density and higher order correlations will be able to confirm the creation of mott - insulating regions as the first evidence was reported in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we have seen that the integrated density fluctuations are not very sensitive to temperature changes when one is deep in the quantum regime .",
    "our principal assumption that the loading of the lattice is approximately adiabatic needs to be verified considering the dynamical process at finite temperature",
    ". it will be equally important to extend our investigations to different and larger systems .",
    "a major goal will be to treat the full three - dimensional bose - hubbard system with a realistic number of particles .",
    "systems with different types of particles will have to be addressed as well , since the development of a new energy scale that does not scale with @xmath9 will have a negative influence on the possibility of reaching the ground state adiabatically .",
    "the visibility results of theory  @xcite at low temperature and experiment  @xcite are in disagreement for bose - fermi mixtures .",
    "it was believed that temperature is such that these systems are not in their ground state  @xcite , and a study by cramer _ et al . _",
    "@xcite hints at heating effects for a weak inter - species coupling .",
    "g the ground state . anti - ferromagnetism and entropy were previously addressed for a homogeneous fermi - fermi system in ref  @xcite .",
    "this work was motivated by the strongly different opinions that existed about temperature effects in the bose - hubbard model , ranging from a constant temperature to a runaway temperature .",
    "we have addressed all aspects of this discussion in homogeneous and trapped , one and two - dimensional bose - hubbard systems and the results of our work are uni - vocal : compatibility of experimental with numerical visibility curves ( and density profiles ) supports that the experimental initial temperature of the bec is deeply in the superfluid phase , and that the quantum regime is not left even when adiabatically ramping up the optical lattice , even in the presence of a considerable mott domain .",
    "the temperature scales almost linearly with @xmath9 when the mott domain is considerable in size , but temperature remains a very low fraction of the value of @xmath9 .",
    "we have copied the experimental procedure of measuring the visibility in our simulations and found good agreement .",
    "it turns out that the wannier function and the averaging over a small region of the interference pattern produce an almost constant shift of the visibility as a function of @xmath91 . for deep lattices ,",
    "the trapping potential becomes effectively steeper , and different mott plateaus are forced to form .",
    "the main contributions to the visibility come from particle - hole excitations giving the visibility a slope of @xmath108 as a function of @xmath91 .",
    "the superfluid volume fraction is too low , but it still absorbs most of the entropy , as we could infer from the local density approximation .",
    "our results strongly support that experimentalists have observed the superfluid and mott phase and their crossover in a trapped system .",
