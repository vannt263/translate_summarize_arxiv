    "to date there are only five x - ray binaries that have been detected at high ( he ; 0.1 - 100 gev ) or very high - energies ( vhe ; @xmath3100 gev ) : ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  @xcite ; ls5039  @xcite , psr b1259 - 63 @xcite , cyg x-3 @xcite , and cyg x-1 @xcite . of these sources , only ls  i  + 61@xmath0303and ls5039  exhibit a non - transient behavior at high - energies and consequently , have been detected as persistent , albeit variable , sources of @xmath1-ray emission .",
    "they also share the property of being ( together with psr b1259 - 63 , see @xcite ) sources detected at both gev and tev energies .",
    "the other systems mentioned have been unambiguously detected only in one band , either at gev or at tev .",
    "the early lat reports of gev emission from ls5039  and ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  were based upon 69 months of survey observations @xcite .",
    "both sources were detected at high significance and were unambiguously identified with the binaries by their flux modulation at the corresponding orbital periods , 26.4960 for ls",
    "i  + 61@xmath0303  @xcite and 3.90603 days for ls5039  @xcite .",
    "the modulation patterns were consistent with expectations from inverse compton scattering models , and were anti - correlated in phase with pre - existing tev measurements ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the anti - correlation of gev  tev fluxes is in fact a generic feature embedded in inverse compton models describing the tev fluxes , where the gev emission is enhanced ( reduced ) when the highly relativistic electrons seen by the observer encounter the seed photons head - on ( rear - on ) ; ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "fermi measurements provided a generic confirmation for these inverse compton models .",
    "both sources presented exponential cutoffs in their high - energy spectra , at least along part of the orbit . to be precise",
    ", an exponential cutoff was a better fit to the sed as compared with a pure power - law in phases surrounding the inferior conjunction ( infc ) of ls5039 , and when taking into account the average spectrum of ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  along its whole orbit .",
    "statistical limitations with the used amount of data prevented the determination or the ruling out of an exponential cutoff in any orbital cut of ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  or in the superior conjunction ( supc ) of ls5039 .",
    "the spectral energy distributions with the exponential cutoffs that were reported were reminiscent of the many pulsars the lat has discovered since launch @xcite , although this was far from a proof of an ls5039  or ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  pulsar nature .",
    "no pulsations has been found at gev energies .    in this work we present the results of the analysis of 2.5 years of lat survey observations of both ls i + 61@xmath2303 and ls 5039 .",
    "we investigate any long - term flux variations of the sources and explore too the possible spectral variability for both systems .",
    "we expect that our analysis will constrain future theoretical studies on these interesting objects .",
    "the fermi gamma - ray space telescope , launched on 2008 june 11 , carries onboard the large area telescope ( lat ) .",
    "the lat is an electron - positron pair production telescope , featuring solid state silicon trackers and cesium iodide calorimeters , sensitive to photons from @xmath420mev to @xmath3300gev @xcite .",
    "it has a large field of view with @xmath42.4 sr ( at 1gev ) and an effective area of @xmath48000@xmath5 for @xmath31gev .",
    "the fermi survey mode operations began on 2008 august 4 .",
    "the full dataset used for this analysis spans 2008 august 4 , through 2010 december 4 .",
    "the data were reduced and analyzed using the fermi science tools v9r20 package . the standard onboard filtering , event reconstruction , and classification",
    "were applied to the data @xcite .",
    "the high - quality  diffuse \" event class was used . throughout the analysis the ",
    "pass 6 v3 diffuse \" instrument response functions ( irfs ) were applied . where required in the analysis , models for the galactic diffuse emission ( _ gll_iem_v02.fit _ ) and isotropic backgrounds ( _ isotropic_iem_v02.txt _ ) were used .",
    "the binned maximum - likelihood method of gtlike , which is part of the sciencetools , was applied to determine the intensities and spectral parameters presented in this paper .",
    "we used all photons with energy @xmath3100mev in a circular region of interest ( roi ) of @xmath6 radius centered at the position of ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  and ls5039 , respectively .",
    "for source modeling , the 1fgl catalog @xcite , derived from 11 months of survey data , was taken .",
    "ls  5039 is located in a complicated region toward the inner galaxy with high galactic diffuse emission and many gamma - ray sources . in an earlier publication about this source",
    "@xcite we derived that a power law plus an exponential cutoff describes best the data .",
    "the photon index was @xmath7 ; the 100300gev flux was @xmath8 and the cutoff energy was found to be @xmath9 .",
    "firstly , we analyzed the orbitally - averaged data of ls  5039 .",
    "as spectral models for ls  5039 , we used a power law as well as a power law with an exponential cutoff , and compared likelihood obtained to test the significance of a spectral cutoff .",
    "the likelihood ratio between the power - law and cutoff power - law cases clearly indicates that the power - law assumption is rejected .",
    "spectral points at each energy band were obtained by dividing the data set into each energy bin and performing maximum likelihood fits for each of them . resulting spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is plotted in figure  [ fig : ls5039_spec ] .    following the h.e.s.s .",
    "analysis by @xcite and our previous analysis , the whole data set was divided into two orbital intervals : superior conjunction ( supc ; @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) and inferior conjunction ( infc ; @xmath12 ) .",
    "the supc and infc data were analyzed in the same way as the orbitally averaged data .",
    "being consistent with our previous paper , the power - law assumption for the supc spectrum is rejected .",
    "although a single power law was not rejected for infc in our previous analysis using 10-month data , a cutoff power law is preferred also for infc with the present data set .",
    "the corresponding sed is shown in figure  [ fig : ls5039_spec ] .",
    "ls i + 61@xmath2303 is one of the brightest sources in the @xmath1-ray sky and towers above other emitters in its neighborhood .",
    "this has allowed us to clearly detect , in march 2009 , a @xmath430% increase on the average flux .",
    "we graphically show the flux change in figure  [ fig : before_after ] , by plotting the folded lightcurves before and after the found transition in march 2009 . before the transition ,",
    "the modulation was clearly seen and is compatible with the already published phasogram , whereas afterwards , the modulation gets fainter .",
    "note that the datasets corresponding to the reported results @xcite and what we here referred to as _ before the flux change _ span almost exactly the same time range , with the consequence of our current analysis essentially reproducing the one previously published@xcite . the spectra derived before and after this flux change",
    "are also shown in figure  [ fig : before_after ] , where the increase in flux is obvious .",
    "ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  has also been monitored with the _ rxte_proportional counter array ( pca ) and folded lightcurves were produced . in the left panel of figure [ fig : multi ] , we show a direct comparison between the phasograms in x - ray and in @xmath1-rays , with simultaneously taken data .",
    "we divide the whole lat dataset into 4 periods of 6 months each and compare them with correspondingly obtained pca x - ray data .",
    "the division in periods of 6-months is justified in order to have enough statistics in @xmath1-rays for each individual time bin , and such that orbit - to - orbit x - ray variability does not dominate the flux fraction changes .",
    "it is apparent that the x - ray modulation is always visible in each of these five panels , albeit with variable amplitude of flux modulation .",
    "instead , at gev energies , the lat data indicates that the modulation fades away until the variability along the orbit is barely visible in the last 6 months of our data . in figure",
    "[ fig : average_flux ] we show the average @xmath1- and x - ray fluxes fitted in each of the periods considered .",
    "the x - ray flux is increasing , whereas the @xmath1-ray flux seems to decrease again after the flux change in march 2009 .",
    "after two years of continuous data taking of the two binary systems ls5039  and ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  we confirm that their energy spectra are best described by a power law function with an exponential cutoff . for ls5039 , in comparison with earlier publications of this source , with larger data set at hand we can extend the observed spectrum to higher energies .",
    "no significant emission of ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  above 30gev has been detected with the @xmath13-lat yet .",
    "furthermore , in the case of ls  i  + 61@xmath0303 variable modulation in the folded light curves was observed . before a flux change in march 2009 ,",
    "the modulation was clearly visible , whereas afterward it faints away .",
    "this behavior was not predicted by any theoretical model so far and has to be investigated further .",
    "the fermi lat collaboration acknowledges generous ongoing support from a number of agencies and institutes that have supported both the development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",

    "<S> the fermi large area telescope ( lat ) has made the first definitive gev detections of the binaries ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  and ls5039  in the first year after its launch in august 2008 . </S>",
    "<S> these detections were unambiguous because , apart from a reduced positional uncertainty , the @xmath1-ray emission in each case was orbitally modulated with the corresponding orbital period . </S>",
    "<S> the lat results posed new questions about the nature of these objects , after the unexpected observation of an exponential cutoff in the gev @xmath1-ray spectra of both ls i + 61@xmath2303 and ls5039 , at least along part of their orbital motion . </S>",
    "<S> we present here the analysis of new data from the lat , comprising 2.5 years of observations through which ls i + 61@xmath2303 continues to provide some surprises . </S>",
    "<S> we find a sudden increase in flux in march 2009 and a steady decrease in the flux fraction modulation . </S>",
    "<S> the lat now detects emission up to 30gev , where prior datasets led to upper limits only . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , contemporaneous tev observations either no longer detected the source , or found it -at least in some orbits- close to periastron , far from the usual phases in which the source usually appeared at tev energies . </S>",
    "<S> the on - source exposure of ls5039 has also drastically increased along the last years , and whilst our analysis shows no new behavior in comparison with our earlier report , the higher statistics of the current dataset allows for a deeper investigation of its orbital and spectral evolution . </S>"
