    "the total inclusive , semileptonic @xmath2 decay rate admits a clean theoretical analysis based on the heavy - quark expansion . the optical theorem is used to relate the decay rate to the forward matrix element of the product of two hadronic currents , which is evaluated using the operator product expansion @xcite .",
    "the total rate is presently known including corrections of order @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath7 ( with @xmath8 a typical hadronic scale ) .",
    "an accurate knowledge of the total rate does not immediately translate into a precise determination of @xmath0 , since experimentally one has to impose cuts on the kinematical variables in order to discriminate the @xmath9 transitions against the much larger @xmath10 background .",
    "the first inclusive determination of @xmath0 was based on a measurement of the charged - lepton energy spectrum in the endpoint region , which is kinematically forbidden for decays with a charm meson in the final state .",
    "this cut eliminates about 90% of the signal .",
    "it is difficult to reliably calculate the remaining event fraction , since the operator product expansion breaks down in this part of the phase space and must be replaced by a twist expansion @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that the situation is improved when a cut @xmath11 with @xmath12 is applied to the dilepton invariant mass @xcite .",
    "this keeps about 20% of the signal events , and the fraction of the remaining events can be calculated in a model - independent way using the operator product expansion . after the cut ,",
    "the typical momentum flow @xmath13 through the hadronic tensor is of order the charm - quark mass or less , so that the problem at hand involves the three scales @xmath14 . in the standard heavy - quark expansion ,",
    "the charm and the @xmath4-quark masses are treated on the same footing , but it is known that the convergence of this expansion at the charm scale can be poor . in this letter we follow the strategy proposed in @xcite and perform a two - step expansion ( the `` hybrid expansion '' ) in the ratios @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the first step is to integrate out the degrees of freedom above the scale @xmath13 and to sum up logarithms of the form @xmath17 using the renormalization group ( rg ) .",
    "this is achieved by expanding the weak currents and the qcd lagrangian to order @xmath18 in the heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite , and calculating the wilson coefficients of the pertinent operators at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in rg - improved perturbation theory .",
    "whereas the wilson coefficients of the leading - order currents @xcite and of the @xmath19 corrections to the hqet lagrangian @xcite were known for a long time , the nlo calculation of the coefficients entering the expansion of the currents at order @xmath18 was completed only recently @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we perform the second step in the hybrid expansion and construct the operator product expansion in the resulting low - energy effective theory .",
    "we calculate the decay rate @xmath20 at subleading order in the ratio @xmath15 and to nlo in rg - improved perturbation theory .",
    "we also resum leading logarithmic corrections to the power corrections of order @xmath21 .",
    "in contrast with previous analyses @xcite we calculate the decay rate directly , rather than calculating the fraction of events that passes the @xmath22-cut and then multiplying this fraction with an independent result for the total semileptonic rate .",
    "since the characteristic scale of the total rate is significantly higher than ( and parametrically different from ) the typical hadronic scale @xmath13 after the @xmath22-cut , the theoretical error can not be reduced by separating the two calculations .",
    "based on a detailed analysis of the residual renormalization - scale dependence and the sensitivity to the definition of the @xmath4-quark mass , we conclude that the @xmath2 branching ratio after the dilepton invariant - mass cut can be calculated reliably , allowing for a determination of @xmath0 at the 10% level .",
    "a cut @xmath11 on the dilepton invariant mass squared @xmath23 implies @xmath24 for the hadronic invariant mass @xmath25 and energy @xmath26 . for @xmath27",
    "both variables vary between @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and thus no charmed hadrons are allowed in the final state .",
    "if the cutoff is chosen higher ( as may be required for experimental reasons ) , the maximal values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 become less than the @xmath30-meson mass .",
    "the kinematical variables that enter the partonic calculation of the decay rate are the parton invariant mass and energy , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 with @xmath34 being the velocity of the @xmath1-meson .",
    "it is convenient to work with the dimensionless quantities @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the phase space for which is @xmath37 while @xmath38 is of order unity , independent of the value of @xmath39 , the quantity @xmath40 is parametrically suppressed by @xmath41 with the optimal value @xmath42 the characteristic scale of the parton momenta is @xmath43 .",
    "the strong - interaction dynamics of the inclusive decay @xmath2 is encoded in the imaginary part of the hadronic tensor @xmath44 defined as @xmath45 where the scalar functions @xmath46 depend on @xmath47 and @xmath32 , or equivalently , on @xmath38 and @xmath40 .",
    "the weak current @xmath48 mediates the @xmath9 transition . to separate",
    "the long- and short - distance physics one usually performs the operator product expansion of the hadronic tensor and calculates the corresponding wilson coefficient functions in perturbation theory .",
    "however , since in the present case the characteristic scale @xmath13 of the momentum flow through the operator product is lower than the @xmath4-quark mass , the perturbative expansion of the wilson coefficients involves logarithms of the ratio @xmath15 . to improve the quality of the perturbative results",
    "these logarithms should be summed . this can be achieved by absorbing the physics above the scale @xmath13 into the couplings of a low - energy effective theory .",
    "the relevant effective theory is the hqet , and the expansion of the weak current at nlo reads @xcite @xmath49 the two operators contributing at leading order are @xmath50 where @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the effective heavy - quark spinor of the hqet . at nlo in @xmath18 ,",
    "the operator basis contains ten independent operators .",
    "six of these are local operators involving a gauge - covariant derivative on one of the quark fields : @xmath53 the remaining four involve time - ordered products of the leading - order currents with the operators @xmath54 and @xmath55 appearing at order @xmath18 in the hqet lagrangian : @xmath56 these nonlocal operators are present because we work with eigenstates of the lowest - order hqet lagrangian , so that all dependence on the heavy - quark mass is explicit .",
    "it is convenient to treat the operators @xmath57 on the same footing as the local operators @xmath58 , because the nonlocal operators mix into the local ones under renormalization .",
    "we have recently completed the calculation of the two - loop anomalous dimension matrix for the operators @xmath59 and solved the rg equations for their coefficients @xmath60 @xcite .    when the expansion ( [ jexp ] ) is inserted into the operator product in ( [ tprod ] ) , all dependence on the @xmath4-quark mass becomes explicit and is contained in the wilson coefficients @xmath61 , @xmath62 and the @xmath18 prefactor of the higher - dimension operators . in the next step ,",
    "we perform the operator product expansion and obtain forward @xmath1-meson matrix elements of local operators of the form @xmath63 in the low - energy theory . to order @xmath21 , these matrix elements can be expressed in terms of the parameters @xcite @xmath64 the anomalous dimension of the kinetic operator vanishes because of reparameterization invariance @xcite .",
    "up to higher orders in the heavy - quark expansion , @xmath65 is determined from the mass splitting @xmath66gev@xmath67 .    by dimensional analysis , the contributions from time - ordered products of higher - dimension operators in ( [ jexp ] )",
    "are suppressed by powers of @xmath68 . at nlo in @xmath69",
    ", it suffices to evaluate time - ordered products with operator insertions of the type @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "the decay rate is then obtained by contracting the result for the hadronic tensor with the lepton tensor and integrating over the portion of phase space with @xmath11 : @xmath72 where @xmath73 from ( [ eq : zmax ] ) .",
    "using the fact that the hadronic tensor is an analytic function of @xmath38 apart from discontinuities on the positive real axis , we have written the expression for the rate @xmath74 as a contour integral in the complex @xmath38-plane .",

    "these diagrams contain infrared divergences for @xmath78 from soft and collinear gluons , which cancel once the differential rate is integrated over phase space , because the rate @xmath74 is an infrared - safe quantity .",

    "whereas for @xmath170 the coefficients of the various terms proportional to @xmath156 in the expressions for @xmath100 and @xmath101 take moderate values ( and are of much smaller magnitude than in the pole scheme ) , some of these coefficients become large for @xmath189 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath133 can also not be taken too small .",
    "the formal limit @xmath190 corresponds to the pole scheme and reintroduces the bad perturbative behavior of expansions based on using the pole mass .",

    "remarkably , the curves corresponding to the different mass definitions all cross at a point close to the center of the window .",
    "we take the central value of the band corresponding to the ps mass with @xmath163 , evaluated at the center of the window , as our central value , and use the results obtained with @xmath163 , @xmath161 and @xmath192 , @xmath202 to get an estimate of the perturbative uncertainty .",
    "the error bar at the default point reflects the sensitivity to the value of the @xmath4-quark mass .",
    "the branching ratio scales as approximately the tenth power of @xmath123 @xcite , and because of this strong dependence this is the dominant theoretical uncertainty in our prediction",
    ". the dependence on the @xmath4-quark mass can be parameterized as @xmath203 where @xmath204 , and the exponent @xmath205 increases with @xmath39 ( see table  [ tab : results ] below ) .",
    "alternatively , one may substitute the ratio @xmath206gev with @xmath207gev or @xmath208gev .",
    "the @xmath209mev error assumed in the figure is less conservative than the @xmath210mev advocated in @xcite , but larger than the @xmath211mev found in @xcite .",
    "= 0.5 cm    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ tab : results ] shows our final theoretical predictions for @xmath194 as a function of the cutoff on the dilepton invariant mass .",
    "we separately list the errors due to the uncertainty in the @xmath4-quark mass , the perturbative uncertainty , and higher - order power corrections .",
    "each of the quantities @xmath99 in ( [ hybrid ] ) receives corrections of order @xmath212 , whose contributions are essentially unknown . because of the prefactor @xmath213 in this equation , the corresponding contribution to the decay rate is to first order independent of @xmath39 and scales like @xmath214 .",
    "correspondingly we assign an error of @xmath215 , where we have used @xmath216mev as a typical hadronic scale .",
    "recently the possibility has been entertained that it might be possible to lower the @xmath22 cutoff below the charm threshold , because the contributions from low - lying charm states can be subtracted using experimental data @xcite .",
    "we have therefore included a result for @xmath217gev@xmath67 in the table .",
    "the results in table  [ tab : results ] compare well with the ones obtained in @xcite , where a value corresponding to @xmath218 was obtained for @xmath27 .",
    "a new element of the present analysis is the study of different mass definition schemes , which allows us to obtain a more reliable estimate of the perturbative uncertainty .",
    "the authors of @xcite have calculated the decay rate in the upsilon scheme using fixed - order perturbation theory at the scale @xmath160 . with this choice of scale and scheme",
    "we find @xmath219 , significantly less than the central value shown in the table .",
    "these authors have also included a partial calculation of higher - order corrections ( terms of order @xmath220 ) and used @xmath221 for the upsilon mass ( with no uncertainty ) , thereby neglecting the nonperturbative contribution estimated in @xcite .",
    "their result reported in @xcite corresponds to @xmath222\\pm 1.7\\,[\\mbox{power}])$ ] .",
    "since the @xmath220 terms are related to the choice of scale in the leading - order correction , it is not clear to us why the quoted perturbative error is smaller than the contribution of these terms . more importantly ,",
    "however , the dominant theoretical uncertainty due to the strong sensitivity to the @xmath4-quark mass has been neglected in @xcite .",
    "we have presented a calculation of the branching ratio for the inclusive decay @xmath2 with a cut @xmath223 on the dilepton invariant mass . since the typical parton momenta @xmath224",
    "after the cut are of order the charm - quark mass , we have performed a two - step expansion in the ratios @xmath15 and @xmath16 and summed logarithms of the form @xmath17 at next - to - leading order . to improve the quality of the perturbative result",
    ", we have eliminated the pole mass in favor of a low - scale subtracted @xmath4-quark mass .",
    "we find that both the potential subtracted and the upsilon mass lead to consistent results for the rate .",
    "considering the residual renormalization - scale dependence and the variations between different definitions of the heavy - quark mass , we estimate the perturbative uncertainty to be of order 10% .",
    "this is comparable to the size of unknown higher - order power corrections , but smaller than the error arising from the uncertainty on the value of the @xmath4-quark mass .",
    "if a value of the cutoff not far above the optimal choice @xmath27 can be achieved experimentally , we conclude that @xmath0 can be determined with a precision of about 10% .",
    "this would be considerably less than the current theoretical uncertainty in the value of this important standard model parameter .",
