    "the universe appears to consist of approximately 30% nonrelativistic matter , including both baryons and dark matter , and 70% dark energy ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review , and references therein ) .",
    "the matter has a density @xmath7 that scales with the scale factor @xmath8 as @xmath9 .",
    "the evolution of the dark energy density depends on its equation of state , which is usually parametrized in the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the pressure and density of the dark energy .",
    "then the density of the dark energy scales as @xmath13 the simplest model for the dark energy is a cosmological constant , for which @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "more complex models have been proposed , in which the dark energy arises from a scalar field ; these are called quintessence models @xcite .",
    "these models generally give rise to a time - varying @xmath1 and more complex behavior for @xmath12 .",
    "however , all of these models have a similar problem . since the matter density decreases more rapidly than the dark energy density , we expect @xmath16 at times much earlier than the present , while in the far future , @xmath17 .",
    "thus , we live in a special epoch , when the matter and dark energy densities are roughly comparable .",
    "this has been dubbed the  coincidence problem . \"",
    "it is possible , of course , that this coincidence is , in fact , just a coincidence , and no deeper explanation is possible .",
    "nonetheless , numerous attempts have been made to provide an explanation for this coincidence .",
    "for example , in a certain class of quintessence models with non - standard kinetic terms (  @xmath18-essence \" ) , the dark energy density tracks the radiation energy density during the radiation - dominated era , but then evolves toward a constant - density dark energy component during the matter - dominated era @xcite , so the coincidence problem is resolved by linking the onset of dark energy domination to the epoch of equal matter and radiation .",
    "( although see malquarti et al .",
    "@xcite , who argued that the basin of attraction for models exhibiting the desired behavior is quite small ) .",
    "another possible solution lies with models in which the periods of matter domination and dark energy domination alternate , either because the dark energy arises from a single scalar field with oscillatory behavior @xcite , or because the periods of dark energy domination arise from different quintessence fields , with a variety of energy scales @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to couple the matter and quintessence fields , so that energy can be transferred between them . with a suitable coupling ,",
    "a constant ratio of dark energy density to matter density can be arranged @xcite .",
    "finally , anthropic arguments have been put forward to resolve the coincidence problem ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but such arguments are , of course , controversial .",
    "the coincidence problem is significantly ameloriated in phantom dark energy cosmologies , first proposed by caldwell @xcite .",
    "such models , with @xmath0 , can lead to a future singularity , or  cosmic doomsday \" @xcite .",
    "( note that starobinsky @xcite previously considered similar models and calculated the time to the future singularity ) .",
    "the existence of this future singularity is often considered a negative feature of phantom dark energy models , so a great deal of effort has gone into constructing models with @xmath19 that avoid a future singularity @xcite . here",
    "we examine a positive feature of phantom dark energy models with a future singularity , previously mentioned in passing by mcinnes @xcite : since such models produce a finite lifetime for the universe , it is possible to calculate the fraction of time that the universe spends in a  coincidental state \" , with @xmath20 . because the final singularity is triggered by the onset of dark energy domination , this fraction is generically nonnegligible .",
    "here we make this argument quantitative .    in the next section ,",
    "we examine the time evolution of phantom cosmologies , and calculate the fraction of the total lifetime of the universe for which the matter and dark energy densities are roughly similar .",
    "our results are discussed in sec .",
    "our goal is to determine , for a universe containing phantom dark energy , the fraction of the total lifetime of the universe for which @xmath21 .",
    "obviously , the question of what present - day observed value of @xmath22 would constitute a  coincidence \" is not well - defined .",
    "the currently observed value is roughly 2 , but a ratio within an order of magnitude , i.e. , @xmath23 would certainly be deemed  coincidental . \" hence , we leave the definition of a coincidence as a free parameter in the calculation . specifically , we define the parameter @xmath24 to be the ratio of the dark energy and matter densities : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the matter and dark energy densities evaluated at an arbitrary fiducial scale factor @xmath28 .",
    "then for any fixed ratio @xmath2 , we can calculate the fraction of time for which @xmath29 , i.e. , the ratios of the dark energy and matter densities are within a factor of @xmath2 of each other in either direction .",
    "phantom cosmologies are characterized by a dark energy component with @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "recent supernova limits on @xmath1 give @xmath30 @xcite , so we will take this as a conservative lower bound on @xmath1 . since the dark energy density scales as in equation ( [ rhode ] ) , the density of dark energy increases with the expansion of the universe . to see why this leads to a future singularity , consider a model containing both matter and phantom dark energy .",
    "we will assume , for simplicity , that @xmath1 for the phantom dark energy is constant , but our results generalize in an obvious way to non - constant @xmath1 .",
    "the friedmann equation for a mixture of matter and phantom dark energy is @xmath31 when @xmath32 , equation ( [ fried ] ) can be integrated to give @xcite @xmath33^{2/3(1+w)},\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the time at which the matter and phantom dark energy densities are equal .",
    "thus , @xmath8 and @xmath12 both go to infinity at a finite time , @xmath35 , given by @xmath36    with regard to the coincidence problem , there are two key points .",
    "first , it is the onset of dark energy domination which triggers this  cosmic doomsday \" , so @xmath34 is naturally a non - negligible fraction of @xmath35 , as shown in equation ( [ tfin ] ) .",
    "second , at the other end of the time scale , because of the power law nature of the expansion , the time during which the universe expands from @xmath37 to @xmath38 will be larger than the time in expanding from @xmath39 to @xmath37 , as long as @xmath2 is sufficiently large .",
    "these two results indicate that the phantom dark energy universe naturally spends a significant fraction of its lifetime in the state for which @xmath40 and @xmath12 are roughly comparable .    the total lifetime @xmath35 of the phantom dark energy universe can be calculated more accurately by integrating equation ( [ fried ] ) : @xmath41 ^{-1/2 } dr.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the total time that the universe spends in expanding from a given initial scale factor , @xmath42 , to a given final scale factor @xmath43 , is : @xmath44 ^{-1/2 } dr.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then the fraction @xmath45 of the total lifetime of the universe that it spends in expanding from @xmath42 to @xmath43 is just @xmath46 . since we are interested in the time over which @xmath47 , it makes sense to express @xmath42 and @xmath43 in terms of the density ratio @xmath24 defined in equation ( [ rdef ] ) . rewriting equations ( [ tu ] ) and ( [ tr ] ) in terms of @xmath24 , rather than @xmath8",
    ", we get a simple expression for @xmath48 : @xmath49 the integral in the denominator converges slowly for @xmath1 near @xmath50 , but it can be expressed in terms of gamma functions , giving : @xmath51 equation ( [ fr ] ) provides the main result of this paper ; it tells us what fraction @xmath45 of the total ( finite ) lifetime of a phantom universe is spent in a  coincidental \" state , with @xmath22 between @xmath52 and @xmath53 . as expected",
    ", @xmath45 is a function only of @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath1 ; it is independent of the current matter and dark energy densities .",
    "as noted above , we choose to calculate @xmath45 as a function of the parameter @xmath2 , taking the limits @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this corresponds to determining the fraction of time for which the matter and dark energy densities are within a factor of @xmath2 of each other in either direction . in fig . 1",
    ", we show @xmath45 as a function of @xmath2 for some representative values of @xmath1 .",
    "= 3truein    as we have suggested , the total fraction of time that phantom cosmologies spend in a  coincidental \" state can be quite large , and it increases as @xmath1 becomes more negative .",
    "if we take a  coincidence \" to be a state for which @xmath40 and @xmath12 differ by less than a factor of 10 ( in either direction ) , then a universe with @xmath56 spends more than a third of its lifetime in such a state .",
    "this fraction decreases to roughly 1/5 for @xmath57 and approximately 1/8 for @xmath58 ; these are still substantial fractions of the total lifetime of the universe .",
    "if we apply a more stringent standard for what constitutes a  coincidence \" , then these fractions obviously shrink .",
    "for instance , the fraction of time for which @xmath40 and @xmath12 differ by less than a factor of 2 varies from 4% for @xmath58 up to 12% for @xmath56 .",
    "even so , these are not negligible fractions of the total lifetime of the universe .",
    "our results indicate that a universe with phantom dark energy spends a significant fraction of its total lifetime in a state for which @xmath40 and @xmath12 differ by less than an order of magnitude .",
    "thus , if we simply found ourselves living at a random moment in such a universe , it would not be surprising to find @xmath40 and @xmath12 in such a  coincidental \" state .",
    "clearly , these results do not explain _ why _ we happen to live in the epoch for which @xmath47 ; instead , they make this possibility less implausible .",
    "these arguments generalize , in an obvious way , to phantom models in which @xmath1 varies with time .",
    "note that this is _ not _ an anthropic argument ; it does not rely on the universe being in a state which can support life .",
    "for instance , this argument could also be applied to a model of the universe in which the ratio of the dark energy , matter , and radiation densities was such that the universe passed directly from the radiation - dominated era to the dark - energy dominated era , without an intervening matter - dominated era . from an anthropic point of view , such a universe is ruled out by the lack of structure formation .",
    "in contrast , the argument presented here would simply indicate that the universe in this case would spend a significant fraction of its lifetime with the radiation and dark energy densities having the same order of magnitude .",
    "caldwell et al .",
    "@xcite noted that the phantom dark energy cosmology forces us to live in the brief epoch in which bound structures can form , but this again is a different argument from the one we are making here .",
    "these results clearly depend on the fact that a phantom - dominated universe has a finite lifetime . the only way to calculate an equivalent fraction of time in an infinitely long - lived universe would be if the epochs of dark energy domination and matter domination alternated in a cyclical fashion , as in the models of refs . @xcite . in such models",
    "one could then determine the probability of living in a  coincidental epoch \" of the sort in which we presently find ourselves ."
