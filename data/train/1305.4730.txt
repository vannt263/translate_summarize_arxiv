    "the equation of state ( eos ) of nuclear matter and the nucleon - nucleon cross sections ( nncs ) in the nuclear medium are hot topics in nuclear physics since a long time  @xcite",
    ". heavy ion collisions ( hics ) provide a unique opportunity to study these subjects in the laboratories around the world .",
    "it has been always difficult , however , to directly extract the information on the eos and nncs from the measured quantities of hic experiments because of the complexity of the collision process and the restriction of the experimental data to the asymptotic configurations recorded by the detectors .",
    "microscopic transport theory has , therefore , been a valuable tool for simulating the dynamical process of hics , so as to link the experimental observables to both the nuclear eos and the in - medium nncs  @xcite .",
    "the collective flow is a common phenomenon of hics , first discovered at the bevalac in 1984 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the directed flow ( also named in - plane or sidewards flow ) and the elliptic flow ( also named out - of - plane flow ) are two lower - order components of the flow which have been widely used for studying hics in a large range of beam energies varying from tens of mev up to several tev per nucleon .",
    "newly measured experimental data of flows were usually compared with corresponding theoretical results , calculated with the most recent updated theoretical transport models , in order to obtain further insight into the properties of the eos and the in - medium nncs .",
    "a large effort has been devoted to constraining the stiffness of the eos of isospin symmetric nuclear matter , e.g. , the pioneer works in ref .",
    "@xcite with sub - threshold kaon production and in ref .",
    "@xcite with collective flow observables , with the result that it is most likely soft with an incompressibility @xmath4 of about 230 @xmath5 30 mev  @xcite . up to now , however , the stiffness of the eos of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter ( `` @xmath6 '' ) , especially at high densities , is still not well constrained and the medium modified nncs have not been well understood either .",
    "thus both , more precise experimental data and self - consistent theoretical models are still called for .",
    "one of the interesting phenomena , already known from early - stage flow - related experiments  @xcite , is the dependence of the directed and elliptic flows on the particle species .",
    "the flow effect is larger for composite particles than for protons . with the subsequent large number of experimental ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) and theoretical ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) endeavors , the presence of this effect was confirmed by observing the increase of flow with the particle mass more precisely , even though the definitions of flow and the interpretations were somewhat different in the respective studies .",
    "recently , by using the large acceptance apparatus fopi at the schwerionen - synchrotron ( sis ) at gsi , a large amount of directed and elliptic flow data for light charged particles ( protons , deuterons , tritons , @xmath0he and @xmath1he ) from intermediate energy hics have been made available @xcite .",
    "moreover , flows are presented differentially in the fopi data  @xcite in the form of both rapidity and transverse momentum distributions .",
    "therefore , new opportunities have been opened up which will allow us to discuss the following questions : + ( 1 ) is it possible to reduce the uncertainty of @xmath4 of the eos by comparing a large number of two - dimensional flow data with model calculations ? + ( 2 ) is it now possible to extract more information on the medium modifications of nncs ? + ( 3 ) how do different cluster recognition criteria affect the flows of light particles ?",
    "this latter question arises because the newly developed isospin - dependent cluster recognition method has been reported to affect the production of light particles  @xcite .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in the next section the new version of the urqmd transport model with the skyrme potential energy density functional",
    "is presented . in section iii ,",
    "results of collective flows of light particles from @xmath2au+@xmath2au reactions at beam energies 150 , 250 and 400 mev@xmath3nucleon are shown .",
    "finally , a summary and outlook is given in section iv .",

    "the main saturation properties of each set are listed in table [ skyrme ] which shows that the saturation density ( @xmath44 ) , the saturation energy ( @xmath45 ) , and the symmetry energy ( @xmath46 ) at @xmath44 are close to their commonly accepted values , @xmath47 @xmath48 , @xmath49 mev , and @xmath50 mev , respectively .",

    "more specifically , the mean field effect is examined in fig.[fig6](a ) and ( c ) where calculations with urqmd - i , urqmd - iii , urqmd - iv and urqmd - v sets are shown , while the cluster recognition effect is tested in fig .",

    "the main reason is that , with fp5 , the reduction of the in - medium cross section is stronger in the urqmd - iii case",
    ". flows of composite particles at intermediate energies are , apparently , very useful to test the behavior of the momentum dependence of in - medium nnecs , especially in the momentum region @xmath99=0.2 - 0.4 gev@xmath100 . secondly , although the absolute values of @xmath91 and @xmath94 are still seen to increase gradually with the increasing incompressibility @xmath4 of the eos , by examining calculations going from urqmd - i , urqmd - iv , to urqmd - v sets , the differences between them are too small to extract a more accurate @xmath4 value than 230 @xmath5 30 mev from the present calculations and experimental data . by employing a much stiffer eos such as siii ( with @xmath4=355 mev )",
    ", we have checked that the sensitivity of the flows to the eos is comparable with previous studies shown , e.g. , ref .",
    "the insensitivity of the flows to the eos shown here is only due that the selected range of @xmath4 values is rather narrow based on the latest progress on it .",
    "it is further noticed that , although the effective mass values of the three skyrme forces are largely different , the flow is not influenced significantly .",
    "it is because that the momentum dependent terms in the skyrme potential energy density functional are obtained by the thomas - fermi approximation to the kinetic energy density and can not fully represent the momentum dependence of the whole non - equilibrium dynamic process .",
    "we note that , in order to obtain an improved flow data set of light fragments for @xmath2au+@xmath2au collisions and to extend the study of the density dependent symmetry energy to other systems , a new experiment ( s394 ) was recently carried out at the gsi laboratory by the asy - eos collaboration @xcite .",

    "[ fig6](b ) and ( d ) one finds that , no matter which flow parameter is chosen , the difference between results calculated with urqmd - ii and with urqmd - iv is also very small . and , the flow parameter difference in some isospin partners such as proton+neutron and @xmath101+@xmath102 is not obvious as well .",
    "it indicates that the different cluster recognition methods mst and iso - mst have only a weak effect on the flow parameters .",

    "[ fig7](c ) , the difference in @xmath56 between mst and iso - mst becomes larger as @xmath75 decreases ) .",

    "in summary , we have studied the directed and elliptic flows of light particles in @xmath2au+@xmath2au collisions at beam energies 150 , 250 and 400 mev@xmath3nucleon by using the updated urqmd model in which the skyrme potential energy density functional is introduced . after the detailed study of the influence of equation of state ( eos ) , medium - modified nucleon - nucleon elastic cross section ( nnecs ) and cluster recognition criteria on flows , the three questions asked in the introduction can be answered : ( 1 ) it is difficult to get a more exact value of the incompressibility from the present flow data than @xmath4 = 230 @xmath5 30  mev , ( 2 ) the different choices of medium - modified nnecs exhibit a significant influence on the light particle flows and , particularly , on the flows of light composite particles ; ( 3 ) the influence of the cluster recognition method on cluster flows is weak . the version of urqmd - iv , comprising the sv - mas08 force with a corresponding incompressibility @xmath4=234  mev , the fu3fp4 medium - modified nnecs and the iso - mst cluster recognition method , describes the directed and elliptic flows of light particles as functions of both rapidity and transverse momentum rather well .    theoretically , the spin - orbit coupling term in the skyrme interactions will be further put into the urqmd transport model after incorporating the spin degree of freedom and its contribution to flows , especially at large rapidities and/or transverse momenta , for intermediate energy hics can then be identified .",
    "together with the forthcoming new flow data of light particles measured by the asy - eos collaboration at gsi , we hope to further reduce the uncertainties in both @xmath4 and @xmath6 of the isospin - dependent eos within the present framework of urqmd in the near future .",
