    "in 1913 niels bohr published his seminal work on the hydrogen atom @xcite where he depicted the electron orbiting the proton as planets orbits the sun .",
    "bohr s pictorial model is used in logotypes of research institutions and companies world wide , and is still the most popular way to draw an atom . with the vocabulary of today",
    ", bohr obtained the quantum mechanical energy levels of the coulomb potential .",
    "but 100 years ago , there was hardly any established quantum theory .",
    "bohr s way of combining well known classical mechanical laws with an innovative quantization of the electron radius ( or equivalently , its angular momenta ) , together with the correspondence principle , had a tremendous influence on the development taking place in the following two decades .",
    "bohr only included circular orbits , although the corresponding classical system have elliptic solutions @xcite .",
    "it must be considered of great historical importance for the development of quantum mechanics that bohr obtained the correct quantum spectrum from his simple model . at first sight ,",
    "the development of the heisenberg - schrdinger quantum theory seemed to be unrelated to bohr s semiclassical treatment .",
    "however , work by einstein @xcite , brillouin @xcite and keller @xcite ( ebk ) , van vleck @xcite , and feynman @xcite , have pointed onto relations between the action for the classical orbits of a particle and the corresponding quantum spectrum .",
    "the interest in relations between classical systems and their quantum counterpart boosted again in the 60s and 70s , due to new powerful computers , with the study of quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "finally a so called periodic orbit theory ( pot ) was introduced for chaotic systems by gutzwiller @xcite , and for different regular systems by balian and bloch @xcite , and berry , mount and tabor @xcite , and others .",
    "now the studies of the periodic classical orbits were related to quantum mechanical observables through so called trace formulae ( tf ) , which had already been studied in the 50s by selberg @xcite .",
    "a trace formula expresses the spectrum of a differential operator , as for example in the time independent schrdinger equation , represented by a train of delta functions , with a sum over the classical periodic orbits .",
    "several principally important quantum systems : the harmonic oscillator ; the cavity ; and again , the hydrogen atom , were soon analyzed within pot @xcite .",
    "these systems could all be connected by the principle trace formula for integrable systems given by berry and tabor @xcite . at the same time , semiclassical approximations were succesful in describing shell structures of different quantum many - body systems from atomic and nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "this was one motivation to also refine the pot further to classical chaotic systems .",
    "studies of ( super- ) shell structures have now been undertaken in new man - made systems : the abundance in atomic metal clusters @xcite , that have been confirmed experimentally @xcite ; in solid state devices , like the conductance of quantum wires @xcite ; in weakly repulsive atomic fermi gasses @xcite , and pairing gaps of attractive fermi gasses @xcite , nano - grains @xcite and recently also in triangular flakes of graphene @xcite .    in this article",
    "we treat a class of quantum systems of principal importance in approximations , the isotropic perturbed harmonic oscillator ( ho ) in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "we here present a tf for @xmath6 to @xmath7 symmetry breaking that gives the gross structure of density of states ( dos ) , sometimes called the level density , to leading order in @xmath8 for the perturbed system and that recovers the quantum mechanical tf in the limit of no perturbation to leading order in @xmath8 .",
    "the breaking of @xmath6 symmetry for collections of hos can have future relevance for many different applications , from nuclear physics and clusters , to more recent systems with cold quantum gasses and graphene .",
    "special cases have been presented before : the quartically perturbed two - dimensional ho was treated by creagh in @xcite ; and the three - dimensional counterpart by brack _",
    "_ in @xcite .",
    "the present treatment follows a similar perturbative technique as pioneered by creagh @xcite , but generalize the special case of quartic perturbation and also allows the treatment of arbitrary dimensions simultaneously .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian of the @xmath9-dimensional harmonic oscillator ( ho ) , as given by the following hamiltonian function defined from the classical space and momentum coordinates @xmath10 @xmath11 we consider an isotropic ho , @xmath12 , with unit mass , @xmath13 , such that the characteristic length scale of the oscillator is @xmath14 .      from the hamiltonian ( [ eq : harmonichamiltonian ] ) we can deduce hamilton s equations , with solutions @xmath15 where @xmath16 are constant vectors .",
    "the solutions are circles in some two - dimensional hyper - plane of the @xmath17 phase - space , which projects to ellipses in the @xmath9-dimensional ( @xmath18- ) configuration space .",
    "note that many different choices of @xmath19 give rise to the same orbit .",
    "for a constant energy @xmath20 we have from ( [ eq : harmonichamiltonian ] ) and ( [ eq : hamiltonsequationandsolution ] ) @xmath21 that is , energy is conserved along orbits . consequently the normalised solutions @xmath22 live on the unit sphere @xmath23 in phase - space .",
    "identifying @xmath24 by @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : harmonichamiltonian ] ) can be rewritten to @xmath28 here @xmath29 denotes transposition of the ( column ) vector @xmath30 , and a bar means complex conjugation .",
    "it then directly follows that the system has @xmath0-symmetry ( invariant under the action of a @xmath9 dimensional unitary matrix ) , since given a matrix @xmath31 we obtain from ( [ eq : harmonichamiltoniancomplex ] ) @xmath32 now hamilton s equation and solution ( [ eq : hamiltonsequationandsolution ] ) simply reads @xmath33 the formulation of the orbits in the phase - space are then simply @xmath34 and an alternative real parametrisation to is @xmath35 where @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "we now choose the initial time ( e.g. ) by setting @xmath38 , such that we determine the initial values of the first components of the phase - space coordinates to be @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    ". then the constant vector @xmath41 can be viewed as living in the complex projective space @xmath42 @xcite . here",
    "the @xmath43 complex parameters in @xmath44 corresponds to @xmath43 real angles that parametrise part of @xmath45 , i.e. , for @xmath46 we have @xmath47 $ ] , with @xmath48 due to the energy conservation , together with the @xmath43 phase angles @xmath49 remaining free when @xmath38 .",
    "this explains the background for the two possible alternative calculations outlined in @xcite for @xmath50 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , many different choices of @xmath51 leads to the same orbits . as we will see",
    "the high dimensional symmetry allows the short mathematical description of all orbits of the same energy",
    ". the discussion below will be short and informal , as the details of the spaces and identifications we mention are covered in standard literature on symplectic geometry and classical mechanics , see for example @xcite . according to , @xmath52 acts on solutions @xmath53 by time .",
    "the remaining symmetry is hence @xmath54 , corresponding to the space of `` special '' unitary matrices of determinant one .",
    "as also shows ; an orbit is completely contained in some complex `` line '' ( a real two - dimensional hyper - plane ) , which we without loss of generality might assume to be the line spanned by the first complex coordinate .",
    "the group of matrices which fixes the first coordinate of a vector while preserving the energy is @xmath55 .",
    "removing this symmetry finally gives us @xmath56 .",
    "so the space of all solutions of the same energy can indeed be parametrized by the complex projective space , in agreement with the specific parametrisation ( [ eq : alternativeparametrisation ] ) with @xmath57 fixed .",
    "a dimension count shows that this yields exactly all of the solutions .",
    "finally , another way to describe this manifold of solutions , which will be of particular use for us , is the following : shows that @xmath58 acts on the energy sphere @xmath23 ( @xmath59 ) ; the well known quotient space @xmath60 is realized by the famous hopf map , which end up being a so - called riemannian submersion when equipping @xmath44 with the fubini - study ( fs ) metric @xcite .",
    "hence schematically it reads @xmath61 in local coordinates , this allows us to write the volume measure on @xmath23 as @xmath62 which will be used in sections [ sec : pertubativetraceformula ] and [ sec : modulationfactor ] . here",
    "@xmath63 is the riemannian volume form : the canonical choice of volume measure induced by the metric .",
    "the well known quantum mechanical energy spectrum of the @xmath9-dimensional harmonic oscillator is @xmath64 where each energy has a degeneracy factor @xmath65 an energy spectrum can be expressed in the form of a trace formula for the density of states ( dos ) @xcite @xmath66 the first term in ( [ eq : generaltf ] ) @xmath67 , is the extended thomas - fermi dos @xcite , which is a smoothly varying function of energy . the second term , being built up by the summation over classical periodic orbits @xmath68 with amplitudes @xmath69 , produce the shell oscillations @xmath70 investigated semiclassically in this article .",
    "the frequencies are determined by the classical actions @xmath71 for the orbits , while the phase is determined by the so called maslov index @xmath72 @xcite .    specifically for the isotropic ho in @xmath9 dimensions",
    ", we can write the trace formula representing the ho spectrum on a complex form to be used later @xcite @xmath73 the above equation is identically equal to the ho spectrum when viewing it as a train of delta spikes , each centered at the positions ( [ eq : hoqme ] ) , and normalized to the degeneracy factor ( [ eq : hoqmd_n ] ) .",
    "moreover , the prefactor in ( [ eq : hotf ] ) , corresponding to the @xmath74 term , is equal to the extended thomas - fermi dos @xcite , i.e. , the first term in ( [ eq : generaltf ] ) .",
    "its leading term in @xmath8 is the thomas - fermi dos @xcite .",
    "moreover , the exponent of the summand in ( [ eq : hotf ] ) is in agreement with the classical action of a primitive ho orbit being @xmath75 , and the maslov index of the ho being zero @xcite .",
    "in this article we consider perturbations to the ho of the form @xmath76 where the small parameter @xmath77 has the dimension of @xmath78 . from and we obtain the full hamiltonian under study here @xmath79 note that for the special case of quartic perturbation , @xmath80 , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : fullhamiltonian ] ) have been studied in two spatial dimensions ( @xmath81 ) in @xcite , and for @xmath50 in @xcite . in the present article",
    "we treat in detail an arbitrary even monomial perturbation in @xmath82 , in any dimension @xmath9 , and in addition give an example of a realistic polynomial perturbation for @xmath50 .",
    "the space of symmetries for this hamiltonian is the set of orthogonal matrices @xmath1 , a smaller space than @xmath0 for the unperturbed case .",
    "if we identify a solution with itself traversed backwards , the symmetries reduces to @xmath83 , the set of orthogonal matrices of determinant positive one .",
    "the resulting space @xmath84 is not so simple to describe , and the lack of an explicit solution to ( [ eq : fullhamiltonian ] ) makes it impossible to completely describe the manifold of the constant energy solutions in the general case .",
    "we now turn our focus to the quantum mechanical energy spectrum of the perturbed ho , with the goal to obtain a semiclassical trace formula for the dos of the hamiltonian within first order perturbation theory .",
    "starting from the ho trace formula and including a complex modulation factor @xmath85 in the sum , we define the perturbative trace formula to according to @xcite @xmath86 the prefactor above only contains the leading order term in @xmath8 of the extended thomas - fermi dos for the unperturbed ho , see the prefactor in , in accordance with the order of the perturbative theory in use .",
    "the modulation factor in is generally defined according to @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath68 ranges over all classical periodic orbit of energy @xmath88 for the unperturbed ho , the last four variables are system dependent parameters .",
    "@xmath89 is the lowest order term , with respect to @xmath77 , of the action in the perturbed system , see section [ sec : perturbativeaction ] . in the following",
    "we shall calculate this expression explicitly . using the hopf map briefly described in section [ sec : classicalho ]",
    ", @xmath90 induces a map on @xmath23 , given by @xmath91 .",
    "notationally we shall not distinguish between the two .",
    "notice that @xmath90 is constant on the fiber @xmath58 . rewriting , @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the fubini - study volume form , @xmath94 is the volume form of the canonical round metric on @xmath23 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "the spherical integral is significantly easier to compute , see section [ sec : reductionmodulationfactor ] .",
    "to analyse the perturbed system , we will use conserved quantities .",
    "since @xmath83 is a lie group , i.e. , a continuous group of symmetries , one can utilize noether s theorem to directly compute conserved quantities . to this end",
    "we define a generalised angular momentum operator @xmath97 according to @xmath98 that is , all combinations of the coordinates from @xmath99 and @xmath100 . using noether s theorem as given in @xcite",
    ", one can show that all the coordinates are conserved for systems with @xmath83 symmetry .",
    "hence , this is just a generalization of the well known situation where angular momentum is preserved in three dimensional systems ( @xmath50 ) with the rotational symmetry expressed by @xmath101 invariance . explicitly calculating the length of @xmath102 from ( [ eq : defgenangmom ] )",
    "reveals that the following identity @xmath103 generally holds , just as in the common case where @xmath104 .",
    "hence , we can define the conserved total angular momentum in @xmath9 dimensions as the area spanned by @xmath105 : @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the angle between the two vectors @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "we here concentrate on the perturbative classical action @xmath90 , that occurs in the exponent of ( [ eq : defmodfactor ] ) .    in order to obtain a scaling for the perturbative action , we consider the following expansion @xmath108 i.e. , with the curve @xmath68 corresponding to a classical diameter orbit . from the above result",
    ", we define the following scale of the first order perturbative action @xmath89 to be used later @xmath109 such that @xmath110 is dimensionless .    according to the first order semiclassical perturbation theory given in @xcite",

    "the intention here is to avoid these technical calculations and use a more geometrical approach , independent of @xmath112 and @xmath9 .",
