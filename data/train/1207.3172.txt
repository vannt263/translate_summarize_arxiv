    "qcd at extreme conditions has been one of the most celebrated subjects in high - energy physics for decades .",
    "the observation of the strong magnetic field @xmath10 in the non - central heavy - ion collision at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) of bnl  @xcite triggered abundant research works , such as the chiral magnetic effect ( cme )  @xcite , chiral magnetic wave ( cmw )  @xcite , qcd phase structure in the presence of magnetic fields , related to the magnetic catalysis  @xcite , electromagnetic properties of qcd matter  @xcite , and so on .",
    "in addition to the magnetic field , the transport coefficients for the hot and/or dense matter is of great importance in general as well , since they characterize the physical properties of the matter . in general ,",
    "those coefficient can be studied by the kubo formula  @xcite . among them , in the present work , we want to investigate the electrical conductivity @xmath0 , which corresponds to the vector - current correlation ( vcc ) and its spectral functions  @xcite , for quark matter at finite temperature and zero quark density @xmath1 .",
    "this condition resembles the present heavy - ion collision experimental conditions , such as rhic and large hadron collider ( lhc ) of cern , in the presence of the external magnetic field .",
    "we note that the conductivity effects much on the magnetic field in terms of the relaxation time  @xcite .",
    "the spectral functions are deeply related to the thermal dilepton production , and the production cross section contains much information on the hadron properties , produced in quark - gluon plasma ( qgp )  @xcite .",
    "the electrical conductivity was investigated in the hot phase of the qcd plasma and extracted from a quenched su(3 ) lattice qcd ( lqcd ) simulation of the euclidean time vcc for @xmath11 , resulting in @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denotes the electric charge for the quark with a flavor @xmath15 , in ref .",
    "similarly , the electrical conductivity was studied with quenched su(3 ) lqcd with the maximum entropy method ( mem ) for vcc in the deconfined phase @xmath16 in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the dilepton production rate was studied as well . in that work , the electrical conductivity turned out to be @xmath17 .",
    "note that the estimated value for @xmath7 is about one order larger in ref .",
    "@xcite in comparison to those from ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , vcc in quenched su(2 ) lqcd simulation was investigated with a chirally invariant lattice dirac operator with a constant external magnetic field .",
    "it was observed that @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which are perpendicular and parallel to the external magnetic field , respectively , are almost the same and insensitive to the external magnetic field for @xmath20 , whereas there appear considerable differences between them at @xmath21 with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "the electrical conductivity was also estimated as @xmath22 for @xmath23 mev with @xmath24 . beside the lqcd simulations , using the green - function method , the electrical conductivity was explored at finite @xmath25 and @xmath26 : @xmath27 mev and @xmath28 mev  @xcite . at specific choices for the model parameters ,",
    "the electrical conductivity was resulted in @xmath29 , which is similar to those from refs .",
    "interestingly , they found that the electrical conductivity is very insensitive to the external magnetic field .",
    "considering the rather unsettled situation for the electrical conductivity for hot and dense quark matter as mentioned above , in the present work , we employ the dilute instanton - liquid model to study it  @xcite .",
    "the model is characterized by the two phenomenological ( instanton ) parameters : average inter-(anti)instanton distance @xmath30 fm and ( anti)instanton size @xmath31 fm . in the instanton ensemble , representing the nonperturbative qcd vacuum , the quarks are delocalized by flipping their helicities . as a result ,",
    "the quarks acquire their momentum - dependent effective mass , corresponding to the finite value for the chiral condensate and manifesting the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry ( sbcs ) .",
    "the momentum - dependent quark mass plays the role of a uv regulator by construction .",
    "since we are interested in the case at finite @xmath25 , the caloron with trivial holonomy is used to modify the instanton parameters  @xcite . by doing that",
    ", the instanton size @xmath32 becomes a smoothly decreasing function of @xmath25 , signaling weakening nonperturbative effects of qcd .",
    "in addition , we utilize the fermionic matsubara formula for inclusion of @xmath25 in the relevant physical quantities in hand . in order to take into account the external magnetic field , which is produced in the peripheral heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "the schwinger method is employed  @xcite .    using the kubo formula for the electrical conductivity ,",
    "we compute @xmath7 as a function of @xmath25 and the relaxation time @xmath33 for the su(2 ) light - flavor sector in the chiral limit , i.e. @xmath34 . from the numerical results , it turns out that @xmath2 for @xmath3 mev with the relaxation time @xmath4 fm .",
    "in addition , we also parameterize the electrical conductivity as @xmath5 for @xmath6 fm , respectively .",
    "these results are well compatible with other theoretical estimations , including those from the lattice qcd simulations .",
    "it also turns out that the external magnetic field plays only a minor role for @xmath7 even for the very strong magnetic field @xmath35 and becomes relatively effective for @xmath9 mev .",
    "moreover , we also compute the soft photon emission rate from the quark - gluon plasma , using the electrical conductivity calculated .",
    "the present work is organized as follows : in section ii , we briefly introduce the present theoretical framework .",
    "the numerical results and related discussions will be given in section iii .",
    "the last section is devoted to summary , conclusion , and future perspectives .",
    "now , we make a brief explanation for the theoretical framework for computing the electrical conductivity .",
    "we note that all the calculations are performed in flavor su(2 ) in the chiral limit @xmath36 .",
    "first , the electrical conductivity can be defined in euclidean space from the kubo formula as follows  @xcite : @xmath37_a.\\ ] ] here , @xmath14 stands for the electrical charge for a light - flavor ( @xmath15 ) quark , i.e. @xmath38 , where @xmath39 denotes the unit charge @xmath40 with the fine structure constant @xmath41 .",

    "note that , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ec1 ] ) , we have taken into account only the connected - diagram contribution , since the disconnected - diagram one @xmath49 contributes to the electrical conductivity negligibly  @xcite . the longitudinal and transverse components for the electrical conductivity are defined with eq .",

    "( [ eq : ec1 ] ) , we make use of the dilute instanton - liquid model  @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the idea that the quarks interact with the nontrivial qcd - vacuum configuration , i.e. instanton ensemble , by flipping their chiralities . as a result , the quark acquires the dynamically generated effective mass , and spontaneously breakdown of chiral symmetry ( sbcs ) is explained . the model is also characterized by the two phenomenological parameters for the light - flavor sectors : average inter-(anti)instanton distance @xmath51 and average ( anti)instanton size @xmath32 . for vacuum ,",

    "we have investigated the electrical conductivity of quark matter at finite temperature and zero quark density @xmath1 , using the dilute instanton - liquid model .",
    "the instanton parameters , i.e. the average instanton size and inter-(instanton ) distance , were modified as functions of @xmath25 according to the caloron distribution . employing the kubo formula , we computed it in the presence of the external magnetic field in the order of @xmath35 .",
    "we compared our results with the lqcd data as well as effective theories .",
    "important observations of the present work are listed as follows :    * the electrical conductivity is an increasing function of @xmath25 and the values for @xmath7 depends on the relaxation time @xmath33 of the quark matter . note that we modify the effective quark mass into a decreasing function of @xmath25 as well as @xmath107 , playing the role of a natural uv regulator and signaling the reduction of the nonperturbative qcd effects at finite @xmath25 .",
    "typically , we have @xmath2 for @xmath3 mev with the relaxation time @xmath4 fm . * recent theoretical estimations including the quenched lqcd data are well reproduced for @xmath108 for a wide @xmath25 range . from the numerical calculations , it turns out that the one - order larger @xmath7 , estimated in the early lqcd data  @xcite ,",
    "corresponds to @xmath109 fm , which is much larger than other values .",
    "this value @xmath109 fm is well consistent with a conservative estimate of the qgp - medium size . *",
    "the external magnetic field provides only negligible effects on the electrical conductivity even for the very strong one in the order of @xmath35 .",
    "however , if we consider the u@xmath110(1 ) anomaly , which is the main source for cme and produced from the number difference between the instanton and anti - instanton in the present theoretical framework , this situation can be altered to a certain extent . * using the numerical results",
    "obtained , the electrical conductivity is parameterized for @xmath3 mev with @xmath111 and , in this parameterization , the coefficients for @xmath112 and @xmath113 are almost negligible in comparison to @xmath114 . as a result , we have @xmath5 for @xmath6 fm , respectively .",
    "these results are again well compatible with other theoretical estimations .    in order to understand qcd at extreme conditions ,",
    "the transport coefficients for quark matter are very important physical quantities to be studied . in the present work",
    ", we have shown that the instanton model reproduced compatible results for the electrical conductivity with other theoretical calculations including the lqcd data , and estimated it as a function of @xmath25 for different relaxation times of the matter for the first time .",
    "hence , it is quite promising and challenging to investigate other coefficients as well within in the same theoretical framework .",
