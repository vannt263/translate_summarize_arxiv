    "the production of heavy quarkonia in relativistic heavy ion collision has been widely studied in consideration of their possible role as probes of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and the qcd deconfinement transition .",
    "@xmath0 is the most promising candidate among the charmonium probes because of its relatively large production cross section and its large branching ratios for leptonic decays .",
    "various competing mechanisms contribute to the production and the suppression of @xmath0 in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "the so - called `` anomalous '' suppression of @xmath0 was first observed in experiments at the cern - super proton synchrotron ( sps ) by the na38 collaboration @xcite , then confirmed by the na50 and na60 collaborations @xcite , and later observed in experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) by the phenix collaboration @xcite .",
    "theoretically , charmonium states are successfully described as nonrelativistic bound states of a @xmath3 pair with a binding potential incorporating one - gluon exchange and a linear confining potential .",
    "matsui and satz @xcite proposed that the color screening of the quark - antiquark potential in a quark - gluon plasma will hinder the formation of charmonia .",
    "their prediction of the suppression of charmonium production preceded the experimental observations ; however , the measurements did not confirm the anticipated suppression pattern . in order to understand the experimental data in detail , various other mechanisms for charmonium suppression",
    "have been investigated , so far without a generally accepted , comprehensive solution . in parallel",
    ", the color screening effect has been studied in several different approaches .",
    "recent results on color screening based on calculations in lattice qcd can be found in @xcite .    besides the screening effect",
    ", the suppression may be caused by the kinetic dissociation of @xmath3 pairs . due to finite formation time of charmonia , while a @xmath3 pair is produced in the collision , the pre - charmonium state may interact with the hard gluons when traversing the medium and dissociate @xcite . in the hadronic phase , the @xmath3 pair may combine with light quarks to form a pair of heavy mesons @xcite .",
    "moreover , the production of @xmath0 can potentially be influenced in the late - phase hadronic environment by scattering with other hadrons and dissociation into a @xmath4 pair @xcite .",
    "these effects will also contribute to the suppression .    in relativistic heavy ion collisions ,",
    "@xmath3 pairs are created in the hard scattering of two gluons , and different charmonium states may be formed when the resonant energy is reached and the correct quantum numbers are established .",
    "for example , according to yang s theorem @xcite , @xmath1 and @xmath0 can be produced through @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "nevertheless , not all charmonia are directly produced in the collision . as the energy of collision increases , the number of @xmath3 pairs created by hard scattering grows .",
    "the recombination of these charm and anti - charm quarks from different binary nucleon collisions may cause a considerable enhancement of the charmonium production .",
    "based on the hydrodynamic simulation of the central collision under rhic condition , between 30@xmath7 and 50@xmath7 of the @xmath0 yield may come from the recombinant production @xcite .",
    "for instance , through the measurement of the @xmath8 decay mode , the decay chain of @xmath9 can be reconstructed in p+p collision @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the suppression of excited charmonia may also result in the reduced production of @xmath0 and other low energy states in the charmonium spectrum due to their greater fragility in the medium .",
    "motivated by the @xmath0 production through charmonium decays , we here investigate the @xmath0 production through the radiative m1 transition of @xmath1 induced by the strong magnetic field generated in the ultra - relativistic a+a collision .",
    "the ability of such transient fields to mix pseudoscalar and vector mesons in the light quark sector was recently discussed by asakawa _",
    "@xcite in connection with the chiral magnetic effect @xcite .",
    "the same mechanism also induces a magnetic dipole transition between the pseudoscalar and vector states of heavy quarkonia . here , we first compute the transition probability @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the magnetic field , by considering the magnetic dipole interaction in the quark model .",
    "then we confirm the computation by utilizing non - relativistic heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory ( nrhh@xmath12pt @xcite ) to the leading order .",
    "finally , we estimate the transition probability in a au+au collision at rhic .",
    "to analyze the transition of @xmath0 from the interaction between @xmath1 and magnetic field generated in the collision , we consider the corona scenario which applies to the hadronic matter remaining near the surface of the colliding nuclei @xcite .",
    "an @xmath1 meson produced near the surface can still interact with the magnetic field generated during the early time when the magnetic field is very strong .",
    "we choose the @xmath13 plane as the reaction plane and assume that the beam is oriented along the @xmath14 direction .",
    "we also assume the nuclear charge @xmath15 to be distributed uniformly within the nuclear radius @xmath16 . in peripheral collisions ,",
    "when the impact parameter @xmath17 , the magnetic field at @xmath18 on the surface can be approximated as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the lorentz contraction factor .",
    "the details of approximation can be found in the appendix of @xcite . since the collision is ultrarelativistic",
    ", the two ions can be visualized as two colliding pancakes due to the lorentz contraction in the @xmath14 direction .",
    "therefore , we expect the region to be in the vicinity of @xmath18 .",
    "we now outline the computation of transition probability in the quark model .",
    "since @xmath1 and @xmath0 are pseudoscalar and vector mesons , respectively , conservation of parity and charge conjugation symmetry dictates that the transition will be governed by the magnetic dipole interaction . by using the time dependent perturbation theory ,",
    "the transition probability amplitude can be written as , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the energy difference of the initial and final states . in our case , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the magnetic dipole moment of the @xmath3 pair . here",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the charge and mass of the @xmath29-quark , respectively , and @xmath30 denotes the spin of the @xmath29-(@xmath31- ) quark .",
    "we neglect strong interaction corrections to the @xmath32-factor of @xmath29-quark . by taking the limit @xmath33",
    ", we obtain the total transition amplitude in the quark model approach as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the modified bessel function of second kind and @xmath36 for @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the transition probability is given by @xmath39 the prefactor @xmath40 represents the strength of the coupling between the charmonium spin and the magnetic field .",
    "a similar result will be expected in the effective field theory ( eft ) calculation , which we perform next , while the prefactor will be replaced by a coupling constant which encodes the non - perturbative physics of the charmonium bound state .",
    "to calculate the transition probability in the formalism of eft , we introduce an effective lagrangian that describes the interaction between @xmath1 , @xmath0 and the magnetic field .",
    "since the hyperfine splitting of @xmath1 and @xmath0 is about 100 mev , the transition can be described non - relativistically in the rest frame of the @xmath0 .",
    "we thus make use of the framework of non - relativistic heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory ( nrhh@xmath12pt @xcite ) . by preserving parity , charge conjugation , and chiral symmetry ,",
    "the leading order interaction term can be written as , @xmath41 , \\label{eq6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is a coupling constant and @xmath43 is the @xmath44 chiral multiplet . due to the presence of the pauli matrix , this term can break the heavy quark spin symmetry .",
    "then the transition amplitude can be written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 $ ] is the relativistic phase space measure , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 represent wave packets of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 . by taking the plane - wave approximation , @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    "will be simply identity .",
    "the subscript @xmath49 denotes the direction of polarization , @xmath50 is the polarization vector of @xmath0 , and @xmath51 is the four - dimensional fourier transform of the external magnetic field . finally , @xmath52 takes into account the normalization of the non - relativistic heavy fields .",
    "the unknown parameter @xmath42 can be extracted from analyzing the decay width of @xmath53 in quark model @xcite .    in order account for the lorentz contraction of the magnetic field ( [ eq1 ] ) in the @xmath14-direction",
    ", we now keep its full @xmath14-dependence . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider the production at @xmath54 near the nuclear surface .",
    "the @xmath55-component of the magnetic field contributed by a single nucleus can be written as @xmath56 where the minus ( plus ) sign is for a right-(left-)moving nucleus .",
    "we firstly evaluate the contribution for the right - moving nucleus . by taking @xmath57 and choosing the light - cone",
    "coordinate , we can easily derive the magnetic field in momentum space , @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 can be rewritten as @xmath61 since @xmath62 non - relativistically , we will make the following approximation to simplify the expression : @xmath63 and @xmath64 inserting @xmath65 into ( [ eq7 ] ) , we obtain the transition probability amplitude , @xmath66 repeating the calculation for the minus sign in ( [ eq8 ] ) , we find @xmath67 .",
    "if we only keep the leading - order term in the expansion of @xmath68 , the full nonrelativistic transition probability can be expressed as , @xmath69 which is equal to the transition probability one finds by just using the magnetic field expression ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "this correspondence reflects the fact that produced @xmath0 mesons are highly localized at @xmath18 .    in the previous calculation",
    ", we analyzed the transition in the rest frame of @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath1 directly produced in the collision may move relativistically . under this circumstance",
    ", the nrhh@xmath12pt has to be promoted to its relativistic version@xcite and the charmonium field must be rewritten as @xmath70\\frac{1}{2}(1-\\slashed v ) , \\label{eq15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the four - velocity of the charmonium multiplet @xmath72 .",
    "however , even in the boosted frame , the structure of the interaction term remains unchanged .",
    "although the transition matrix element only depends on the energy of photon , the transition rate can vary due to the kinematics .",
    "when @xmath1 carries large transverse momentum , and we go into the longitudinally co - moving frame of the charmonium states , we have the relation @xmath73 along with the delta function which imposes the conservation of transverse momentum in ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "thus , we can approximately write @xmath74 using these approximations , the relativistic transition probability becomes : @xmath75 compared with the nonrelativistic result ( [ eq14 ] ) , the relativistic result ( [ eq18 ] ) contains a factor @xmath76 in the denominator , which causes a significant suppression when the transverse momentum is much greater than the charmonium mass .",
    "now , let us find some numerical results for au+au collisions at the highest rhic energy . by taking @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and using ( [ eq5 ] ) ,",
    "we obtain the transition probability @xmath79 in the quark model . to derive the numerical result for the eft calculation",
    ", we need to determine the numerical value of @xmath42 . by computing the decay width of @xmath53 in the framework of nrhh@xmath12pt and comparing the result",
    "with that derived in the quark model @xcite , we find @xmath80 and thus @xmath81 .",
    "if the relativistic correction is taken into account , we find @xmath82 and @xmath83 . for the transition with large energy of the photon , the probability amplitude can also be computed in eft framework by utilizing potential non - relativistic qcd(pnrqcd)@xcite , while the result at",
    "leading order would be tantamount to that in the quark model .",
    "we thus conclude that the leading - order result for the magnetically induced transition probability from @xmath1 to @xmath0 is about @xmath2 . unfortunately , this contributi on to @xmath0-production is hardly observable experimentally .",
    "we now consider some possible sources of corrections to this result . at the next - to - leading order",
    ", the coupling constant @xmath42 can be affected by the contribution of intermediate hadronic loops , which is indicated in the recent study of charmonium decays @xcite . however ,",
    "when matching to the experimental data of @xmath53 decay , the correction will lead to further suppression on @xmath42 , which makes the transition probability even smaller . in pnrqcd",
    ", the correction from the higher derivatives will result in the suppression of transition matrix element as well@xcite . according to ( [ eq14 ] )",
    ", the transition probability will be independent of @xmath84 in the ultra - relativistic limit ( @xmath85 ) since @xmath86 as @xmath87 .",
    "increasing the collision energy further ( e.  g.  to lhc energies ) will thus not change the result much . on the other hand , the result ( [ eq18 ] ) for large transverse momentum will give a more substantial suppression .",
    "we thus conclude that our quantitative estimate represents a robust upper bound .    in summary",
    ", we analyzed the contribution to @xmath0 production in relativistic heavy ion collisions through the magnetic dipole transition of @xmath1 due to the interaction with the strong magnetic field generated in the collision .",
    "we evaluated the transition probability in the framework of the quark model and in the eft approach .",
    "the eft approach shows that the polarization of the produced @xmath0 will be parallel to the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "both approaches lead to comparable results , in which the transition probability is about @xmath2 , which is probably too small to be observed experimentally .",
    "we also considered the case when the @xmath1 and @xmath0 carry a large transverse momentum and found that the result is further suppressed .",
