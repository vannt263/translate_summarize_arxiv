    "the time - resolved gamma - ray burst ( grb ) spectra have the mean observed photon spectral index @xmath10 close to @xmath11 ( i.e. @xmath12 ) and some spectra can be as hard as @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "synchrotron shock models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) assume that a fraction of the available energy is given instantaneously to the electrons which are injected at lorentz factor @xmath14 .",
    "the typical cooling time - scale is smaller that the light crossing time of the source by a factor @xmath15 , where the compactness @xmath16 is about @xmath17 for typical grb parameters @xcite . because the cooling time is small",
    ", one observes the time - averaged spectrum of cooling electrons @xcite .    for relativistic electrons ,",
    "the photon emission frequency is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 for synchrotron or synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) radiation .",
    "thus , the rate of the frequency change @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the emitted power . the time - averaged flux is then @xmath22 and the `` cooling '' spectrum is @xmath0 ( i.e. @xmath23 ) for synchrotron as well as for ssc @xcite , which is much softer that those observed from grbs .",
    "the immediate conclusion from this simple exercise is that _ all _ the models involving injection of electrons at large energies should be rejected .",
    "the efficient cooling can be prevented if the energy is supplied to the electrons in small steps . in this paper , we discuss consequences of the assumption that the available energy is supplied continuously to the particles over the life - time of a source .",
    "we study how the resulting spectrum depends on main parameters and determine parameter range where model spectra are consistent with the majority of the observed ones .",
    "a number of physical models can produce a source of continuously heated particles . these can be plasma instabilities behind ultrarelativistic shocks @xcite or dissipation of the magnetic energy in a poynting flux dominated outflow ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we consider a toy model where energy is injected to the emission region with the constant rate during comoving time @xmath24 . we adopt a slab geometry with the thickness @xmath25 ( in units of @xmath26 ) which may depend on the specific scenario .",
    "the energy is injected uniformly over the slab volume in a form of acceleration of electrons ( and pairs ) which obtain equal amount of energy per unit time .",
    "the model is fully described by four parameters : ( i ) the initial thomson optical depth across the slab , @xmath27 ; ( ii ) the comoving size @xmath26 ; ( iii ) the dissipation compactness , @xmath28 related to the observed isotropic energy release @xmath29 and the ejecta bulk lorentz factor @xmath30 , which determines the rate of pair production ; and ( iv ) the magnetic compactness @xmath31 determining the role of synchrotron radiation .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "let us first consider how particles ( electron and positrons ) of lorentz factor @xmath32 are heated and how do they cool .",
    "the energy gain rate of a particle is simply given by the heating rate @xmath33 divided by the number of particles ( which is proportional to the total thomson optical depth , including pairs , across the slab , @xmath1 ) .",
    "particles cool by emitting synchrotron radiation and by scattering this radiation ( ssc ) .",
    "the energy balance equation can be written as : @xmath34 where @xmath35 accounts for the reduced synchrotron cooling due to synchrotron self - absorption and @xmath36 is the compactness corresponding to the energy density of soft photons in the thomson regime .",
    "it can be expressed as a sum of the synchrotron @xmath37 and first compton scattering @xmath38 energy densities , where @xmath39 is the compton parameter . if mean lorentz factor @xmath40 , then one need to account for further scattering orders .",
    "the typical cooling time , @xmath41 $ ] , is orders of magnitude smaller than the light - crossing time @xmath24 for grb conditions .",
    "the balance between heating and cooling is achieved at @xmath42 and thus @xmath43 .",
    "particles with @xmath44 lose energy faster than they gain it , while at @xmath45 the situation is opposite resulting in a narrow distribution peaked at @xmath46",
    ".    main radiative process is determined by the instantaneous optical depth @xmath1 , which can be significantly larger than the initial @xmath47 because of pair production at @xmath48 . if @xmath49 , then @xmath50 and the main emission mechanism is synchrotron .",
    "a typical energy of a synchrotron photon in the frame comoving with the ejecta ( in units @xmath51 ) is @xmath52 , for @xmath53 ( where @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) and compton scattering is in klein - nishina limit .    if @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "this time , first compton scattering peak is at @xmath59 , and one can neglect further scatterings . at @xmath60 , second compton scattering will dominate the energy output . for high compactness source @xmath1 can reach 1 , then @xmath3 and",
    "multiply compton scatterings ( quasi - thermal comptonization ) have to be accounted for .",
    "the simulations were performed using a large particle monte carlo code described in @xcite .",
    "it treats compton scattering , photon - photon pair production and pair annihilation , synchrotron radiation and synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "the electron / pair and photon distributions are computed self - consistently .    as an example",
    ", we consider @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 ( corresponding to @xmath64 and @xmath65 erg ) , and @xmath66 , which are typical for grb ejecta @xcite .",
    "the resulting evolution of broad - band photon spectra and electron distributions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] . at the start of simulations @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( see dashed curves ) .",
    "partially self - absorbed synchrotron peaks at @xmath69 ( uv in the observer frame ) with low - energy tail @xmath70 may be responsible for the prompt optical emission seen in grb 990123 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath1 starts to grow due to pair production , @xmath71 drops as @xmath72 , and the first compton peak moves to softer energies crossing the ` batse window ' .",
    "this spectral evolution is consistent with the observed in time - resolved pulses @xcite .",
    "the low - energy slope of this component , corresponding to compton scattering by isotropic monoenergetic electrons , can as hard as @xmath73 ( i.e. @xmath74 ) , reproducing most of the observed grb spectra .",
    "the second compton component peaking at @xmath75@xmath76 mev rises later and decays on a longer time - scale .",
    "it can be responsible for the delayed emission observed by egret from grb 941017 @xcite .",
    "thus , at @xmath77 , the model spectra reproduce well the observed ones from grbs , including their hardness , spectral evolution , as well as optical and 100 mev emission .",
    "small @xmath1 required for synchrotron to be responsible for the batse grbs are difficult to get in any physical scenario .",
    "additionally , the synchrotron low energy spectrum @xmath78 is softer that the observed ones @xcite . at @xmath79",
    ", the resulting quasi - thermal comptonization spectrum may be too soft for most of the grb spectra .",
    "the emission peaks at 1050 kev in the comoving frame of the ejecta and , for @xmath80 , this peak shifts to an uncomfortably high energy @xcite . in conclusion , ssc from continuously heated electrons ( pairs ) seems to be the most promising model to explain the observed properties of grbs ."
