    "the lower threshold at 5 kev limited the understanding of the characteristic properties of the pulsar at soft x - rays .",
    "a blackbody component at a temperature of 8 kev is rarely reported so far and difficult to explain in accretion powered x - ray pulsars .",
    "they also did not find any evidence of presence of an iron line or cyclotron line features in the pulsar spectrum .",
    "@xmath14 observations of the pulsar during type  i outbursts , though used a blackbody and power - law components to explain the 2.7 - 30 kev spectrum , the blackbody temperature was estimated to be @xmath631.4 during entire outburst ( reig & coe 1999 ) .",
    "the presence of an iron emission line at 6.4 kev was seen in the @xmath14 spectra .",

    "as additional matter is being accreted onto the neutron star , the value of the equivalent hydrogen column density increases significantly .",
    "this increase in column density modifies the emitted radiation at soft x - rays . while simultaneous spectral fitting to the pulsar spectrum in 1 - 200 kev energy range , the estimated value of column density always exceeded the corresponding galactic value in the direction of the pulsar . even though , we attempted to fit the broad - band spectra of exo  2030 + 375   with various continuum models , partial covering model provided best - fit to the data .",
    "though the estimated value of absorption column density was higher , another significant absorption component with certain value of covering fraction ( as given in table  1 ) was required in the spectral fitting .",
    "exo  2030 + 375   being a bright hard x - ray pulsar and presence of significant amount of matter at periastron passage , there is a possibility of ionizing the surrounding matter . to investigate this",

    "these si and s lines were missed out from detection . during giant outbursts which are not associated with the periastron passage , lack of significant amount of additional matter in the close proximity of the neutron star as detected during type  i outbursts ,",
    "reduces the chance of presence / detection of these emission lines in the spectrum .",
    "the spectral fitting of @xmath0 observation of the pulsar did not show any evidence of presence of cyclotron absorption features at earlier reported energies from other observations .",
    "pulse - phase resolved spectroscopy of the @xmath0 observation of exo  2030 + 375   showed that the value of additional column density ( @xmath64 ) due to the material local to the neutron star was about two orders of magnitude higher at certain pulse phases .",
    "it can be seen ( from the top panels of figure  [ phrs ] ) that absorption dips are present at same pulse phase ranges .",
    "the additional high value of @xmath64 , therefore , explains the presence of absorption dips in the pulse profile .",
    "apart from the variation of the additional column density and covering fraction over pulse phases , the value of high energy cut - off was found to be higher at dip phases .",
    "however , other parameters did not show any systematic variation over the pulse phases .",
    "in this paper , we performed timing and broad - band spectral analysis on the @xmath0 observation of the be / x - ray transient pulsar exo  2030 + 375   during the peak of a type  i outburst .",
    "the 41.41 s pulsations were detected in the light curves up to as high as @xmath1100 kev .",
    "the pulse profiles are found to be strongly energy dependent .",
    "narrow dips which are generally seen in the pulse profiles of accretion powered pulsars up to @xmath110 kev , are seen in the profiles up to as high as 70 kev . at soft x - rays , the shape of the pulse profiles",
    "is found to be complex whereas at high energies , it appeared symmetrical .",
    "the complex nature of the profiles at soft x - rays is interpreted as because of the presence of several absorption dips . a partial covering power - law with high energy cut - off continuum ( with neutral as well as partially ionized absorber )",
    "model was found to be the preferred model to describe the broad - band spectrum in 1.0 - 200.0 kev energy range .",
    "high values of additional column density at the dip phases in the pulse profile confirm the presence of stream of absorbers that are phase locked with the pulsar .",
    "apart from the fluroscence iron emission line , several low energy lines from s and si are also detected in the pulsar spectrum .",
    "cyclotron resonance scattering features , though reported earlier in the spectrum of this pulsar , are not detected in the 1.0 - 200.0 kev spectrum of the pulsar .",
    "pulse - phase resolved spectroscopy revealed that the higher values of ionization parameter at the dip phases of the pulse profile may be the cause of the presence of dips up to @xmath170 kev .",
