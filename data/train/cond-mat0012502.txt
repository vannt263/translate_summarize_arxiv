    "in the present paper we exhibit , for a very simple quantum system , namely two spins 1/2 , a possible confluence of concepts coming from three distinct physical areas : nonextensive statistical mechanics , quantum entanglement and theory of critical phenomena .",
    "the formalism of nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite was proposed in 1988 by one of us , and is currently being applied @xcite to a variety of thermodynamically anomalous systems which , in one way or another , exhibit ( multi)fractals aspects . among these anomalous systems , a prominent place is occupied by systems including long - range interactions .",
    "so being , it is after all not surprising that this thermostatistical formalism has interesting implications @xcite in the area of quantum entanglement and its intrinsic nonlocality .",
    "finally , quantum systems can be more or less entangled , which makes relevant the discussion of whether a given system is or not separable .",
    "separability , which we shall define in detail later on , is a crucial feature in the discussion on whether a quantum physical system is susceptible of a _ local realistic _ description with hidden variables .",
    "these issues were first discussed in 1935 by einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) @xcite and by schroedinger @xcite , and since then by many others@xcite .",
    "the very concept of _ degree _ of entanglement makes one naturally to think of the concept of order parameter in the theory of critical phenomena .",
    "consequently , the above mentioned triple confluence emerges quite naturally .",
    "quantum entanglement is a quite amazing physical phenomenon , and has attracted intensive interest in recent years due to its possible applications in quantum computation , teleportation and cryptography , as well as to its connections to quantum chaos .",
    "as we shall see , entropic nonextensivity provides a path through which a critical phenomenon scenario can be established to quantitatively characterize quantum entanglement . in section",
    "ii we present , along abe s lines@xcite , the _ classical _ concept of nonextensive conditional entropy . in section iii",
    "we formulate its _ quantum _ version and use it , along the lines of @xcite , to discuss a simple bipartite spin system .",
    "the results thus obtained enable the numerical calculation of relevant quantities which , exploring the degree of nonextensivity reflected by the entropic index @xmath15 , make a critical phenomenon scenario to emerge for quantum entanglement .",
    "we finally conclude in section iv .",
    "the classical version of nonextensive statistical mechanics is based on the following entropic form@xcite : @xmath16 which is nonnegative ( @xmath17 ) , concave ( convex ) for @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , achieves the extremal value @xmath20 at equiprobability ( a maximum if @xmath18 and a minimum if @xmath19 ) , and reproduces , in the @xmath21 limit , the boltzmann - gibbs entropy @xmath22 . if @xmath19 , the sum runs only on",
    "_ strictly _ positive probabilities @xmath23 .",
    "let us divide the set of @xmath24 possibilities in @xmath25 nonintersecting subsets respectively containing @xmath26 elements , with @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "we define the probabilities @xmath29 , @xmath30 , ... , @xmath31 ,",
    "hence @xmath32 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify the following generalization of the celebrated shannon property : @xmath33 where , consistently with bayes formula , @xmath34 are the _ conditional _ probabilities , and satisfy @xmath35 .",
    "the nonnegative entropies @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 depend respectively on @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath39 probabilities . eq .",
    "( 2 ) can be rewritten as @xmath40 where the _",
    "unnormalized @xmath15-expectation value _ of the conditional entropy is defined as @xmath41 also , since the definition of @xmath37 implies @xmath42 eq . ( 2 ) can be rewritten as follows : @xmath43 consequently @xmath44 where the _",
    "normalized @xmath15-expectation value _ of the conditional entropy is defined as @xmath45 with the _ escort probabilities_@xcite @xmath46 property ( 7 ) is , as we shall see later on , a very useful one , and it exhibits a most important fact , namely that the definition of the nonextensive entropic form ( 1 ) naturally leads to normalized @xmath15-expectation values and to escort distributions .    let us further elaborate on eq .",
    "it can be also rewritten in a more symmetric form , namely as @xmath47[1+(1-q)\\langle \\langle s_q(\\{\\ p_i / \\pi_k\\ } )   \\rangle \\rangle_q]\\ ] ] since the _ renyi entropy _ ( associated with the probabilities @xmath23 ) is defined as @xmath48 , we can conveniently define the ( monotonically increasing ) function @xmath49 \\equiv \\ln[1+(1-q)x]/[1-q]=\\ln \\{[1+(1-q)x]^{[1/(1-q)]}\\}$ ] ( with @xmath50=x$ ] ) , hence , for any distribution of probabilities , we have @xmath51 $ ] . eq .",
    "( 10 ) can now be rewritten as @xmath52 = { \\cal r}_q[s_q(\\{\\pi_k\\ } ) ] + { \\cal r}_q[\\langle \\langle s_q(\\{\\ p_i / \\pi_k\\ } )   \\rangle \\rangle_q]\\;,\\ ] ] or equivalently , @xmath53   \\rangle \\rangle_q]\\;,\\ ] ] where the inverse function is defined as @xmath54 \\equiv [ ( e^y)^{(1-q)}-1]/[1-q]$ ] ( with @xmath55=y$ ] ) .",
    "notice that , in general , @xmath56 \\ne \\langle \\langle { \\cal r}_q [ ... ] \\rangle \\rangle_q$ ] .",
    "everything we have said in this section is valid for _ arbitrary _ partitions ( in @xmath25 nonintersecting subsets ) of the ensemble of @xmath24 possibilities .",
    "let us from now on address the particular case where the @xmath24 possibilities correspond to the joint possibilities of two subsystems @xmath57 and @xmath58 , having respectively @xmath59 and @xmath60 possibilities ( hence @xmath61 ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath62 the probabilities associated with the total system @xmath63 , with @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "the _ marginal probabilities _ @xmath66 associated with subsystem @xmath57 are given by @xmath67 , and those associated with subsystem @xmath58 are given by @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath57 and @xmath58 are said to be _ independent _ if and only if @xmath69 .",
    "we can now identify the @xmath25 subsets we were previously analyzing with the @xmath59 possibilities of subsystem @xmath57 , hence the probabilities @xmath70 correspond respectively to @xmath66 .",
    "consistently , eq . ( 7 ) implies now @xmath71 = s_q[a ] + s_q[b|a ] + ( 1-q)s_q[a]s_q[b|a]\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath72 \\equiv s_q(\\{p_{ij}\\})$ ] , @xmath73 \\equiv s_q(\\{p_i^a\\})$ ] and the conditional entropy @xmath74 \\equiv \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{w_a } ( p_i^a)^q s_q[b|a_i]}{\\sum_{i=1}^{w_a } ( p_i^a)^q } \\equiv \\langle \\langle s_q[b|a_i \\rangle \\rangle_q\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath75 \\equiv \\frac{1- \\sum_{j=1}^{w_b } ( p_{ij}/p_i^a)^q}{q-1}\\;\\;\\;(i=1,\\;2,\\; ... ,\\;w_a)\\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath76 .",
    "symmetrically , eq . ( 13 ) can be also written as @xmath71 = s_q[b ] + s_q[a|b ] + ( 1-q)s_q[b]s_q[a|b]\\;.\\ ] ] if @xmath57 and @xmath58 are independent , then @xmath77 , hence @xmath78",
    "= s_q[a]$ ] and @xmath79 = s_q[b]$ ] , therefore both eqs .",
    "( 13 ) and ( 16 ) yield the well known pseudo - extensivity property of the nonextensive entropy @xmath80 , namely @xmath71 = s_q[a ] + s_q[b ] + ( 1-q)s_q[a]s_q[b]\\;.\\ ] ] we thus see that eqs . ( 13 ) and ( 16 ) nicely compress into _ one _ property two important properties of the entropic form @xmath80 , namely eq . ( 2 ) and eq.(17 ) . the axiomatic implications of these relations have been discussed by abe@xcite .",
    "let us now address the quantum version of the expressions discussed in the previous section .",
    "( 1 ) is generalized into @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the density operator .",
    "( 1 ) is recovered as the particular instance when @xmath82 is diagonal .",
    "let us assume now that @xmath82 is the density operator associated with a composed system @xmath63",
    ". then the marginal density operators are given by @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "the systems @xmath57 and @xmath58 are said to be _ uncorrelated _ ( or _ independent _ ) if and only if @xmath86 otherwise they are said to be _ correlated_. two correlated systems are said to be _ separable _ ( or _ unentangled _ ) if and only if it is possible to write @xmath82 as follows :    @xmath87    the limiting case of independency is recovered for _ certainty _ , i.e. , if all @xmath23 vanish excepting one which equals unity .",
    "_ nonseparability _ ( or _ entanglement _ ) is at the basis of the amazing phenomena mentioned in the introduction and , as already mentioned , at the center of the admissibility of a _ local realistic _ description of the system in terms of hidden variables .",
    "correlation is a concept which is meaningful both classically and quantically .",
    "entanglement , in the present sense , is meaningful only within quantum mechanics .",
    "the characterization of quantum entanglement is not necessarily simple to implement , since it might be relatively easy in a specific case to exhibit the form of eq .",
    "( 20 ) , but it can be nontrivial to prove that it _ can not _ be presented in that form . consequently ,",
    "along the years appreciable effort has been dedicated to the establishment of general operational criteria , preferentially in the form of necessary and sufficient conditions whenever possible .",
    "peres@xcite pointed out a few years ago a _ necessary _ condition for separability , namely the nonnegativity of the partial transpose of the density matrix . in some simple situations ( like the simple mixed state of two spin 1/2 we shall focuse on later on ) peres criterion",
    "is now known to also be a _",
    "sufficient _ condition .",
    "but , as soon as the case is slightly more complex ( e.g. , @xmath88 or @xmath89 matrices ) it is known now to be _ insufficient_.    it is within this scenario that abe and rajagopal@xcite recently proposed a different condition , presumably a _ necessary _ one , based on the nonextensive entropic form @xmath80 given in eq .",
    "let us summarize the idea .",
    "the quantum version of conditional probabilities is uneasy to formulate in spite of being so simple within a classical framework ( see section ii ) .",
    "the difficulties come from the fact that generically @xmath82 does not commute with either @xmath90 or @xmath91 .",
    "consistently , the concept of _ quantum conditional entropy _ is a sloppy one .",
    "abe and rajagopal suggested a manner of shortcutting the difficulty , namely through the adoption , also for quantum systems , of eqs .",
    "( 13 ) and ( 16 ) as they stand .",
    "consequently , the conditional entropies @xmath92 and @xmath93 are respectively given by @xmath94 and @xmath95 where @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "obviously , for the case of independence , i.e. , when @xmath99 , these expressions lead to @xmath100 and @xmath101 , known to be true also in quantum mechanics .",
    "both classical and quantum entropies @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 are always nonnegative .",
    "this is not the case of the conditional entropies @xmath92 and @xmath93 , which are always nonnegative classically , but which can be negative quantically ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore natural to expect that separability implies nonnegativity of the conditional entropies .",
    "this is the criterium proposed in @xcite .",
    "more over , since these conditional entropies are monotonically decreasing functions of @xmath15 , the strongest case corresponds to the nonnegativity of both @xmath105 and @xmath106 .    in what follows",
    ", we shall illustrate these general ideas on a paradigmatic two spin 1/2 system .",
    "the simplest basis for describing such a system is @xmath107@xmath3@xmath108 , @xmath107@xmath3@xmath4 , @xmath107@xmath6@xmath108 and @xmath107@xmath6@xmath4 .",
    "all these states clearly are unentangled .",
    "another popular basis is the _ triplet _ constituted by @xmath107@xmath3@xmath108 , @xmath107@xmath6@xmath4 and @xmath109@xmath2@xmath3@xmath4@xmath110@xmath6@xmath7 , together with the _ singlet _ @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3@xmath4@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7 . here",
    ", we start having entanglement .",
    "finally we have the bell basis , convenient for a variety of experimental situations , constituted by @xmath111@xmath2@xmath3@xmath4@xmath112@xmath6@xmath7 and @xmath113@xmath2@xmath3@xmath114@xmath6@xmath115 .",
    "each state of this basis is fully entangled .",
    "they satisfy @xmath116 with @xmath117 .",
    "let us first assume that our bipartite system is in a simple mixed state ( so called werner - popescu @xcite state ) , namely @xmath118 or equivalently @xmath119 where we have used eq .",
    "( 23 ) . for @xmath120 and @xmath121",
    "we have the fully entangled epr state and the fully random one respectively .",
    "the question arises : up to what value of @xmath122 is separability possible ?",
    "the use of the bell inequality yields that the threshold can not exceed @xmath123 .",
    "the use of the @xmath124-entropic inequality @xcite yields a more severe restriction , namely that it can not exceed @xmath125 .",
    "the strongest result , i.e. , the necessary and sufficient condition , was finally found ( by imposing the nonnegativeness of the partial transpose of the density matrix ) by peres @xcite , and it is @xmath126 .",
    "as already mentioned , this peres recipe is known to be a _ necessary _",
    "condition for all sytems , and has been shown to be also _ sufficient _ for this @xmath127 system ( as well as for some @xmath128 systems ) , whereas it is known to be _ insufficient _ for @xmath88 and @xmath89 or more complex systems @xcite .",
    "it is this @xmath126 result that abe and rajagopal @xcite elegantly reproduced .    along the same lines , it was recently considered@xcite a more general mixed case , namely @xmath129 or equivalently @xmath130 with @xmath131 . eqs .",
    "( 24 ) and ( 25 ) are reproduced in the @xmath132 case .",
    "the pure states @xmath133@xmath134 , @xmath135@xmath134 , @xmath109@xmath134 and @xmath1@xmath134 ( epr state ) respectively correspond to @xmath136 and @xmath137 . for this state , it was found@xcite @xmath138.\\ ] ] and @xmath139 substituting these two last expressions into eqs .",
    "( 21 ) and ( 22 ) we obtain @xmath140 as an explicit function of @xmath141 ( see figs . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "both @xmath102 and @xmath140 are invariant under the transformations @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and the analogous ones .",
    "@xmath144 implies @xmath145 in the limit @xmath146 , this relation implies @xmath147 the same condition can be straightforwardly found through peres partial transpose procedure .",
    "it was advanced in @xcite that perhaps the conditional entropic criterium ( i.e. , nonnegativity of both @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) was a _",
    "sufficient _ condition , in addition of being a _ necessary _ one .",
    "the analysis@xcite of further and more complex systems ( e.g. , the full @xmath127 case , whose associated density matrix involves 15 independent real numbers , as well as selected many - spin mixed states ) has shown counterexamples that in general preclude such possibility . in all cases that we have fully worked out ,",
    "the entropic criterium has either provided the same result as the peres one , or has proved to be slightly less restrictive .",
    "although we have no proof that it can not be the other way around ( i.e. , peres criterium being less restrictive than the entropic one ) , we have not encountered such an example ( see @xcite for more details ) . in some cases of increasingly many spins ,",
    "both criteria have produced the same result , presumably the asymptotically exact answer .",
    "details will be published elsewhere@xcite . as a general trend",
    ", it seems that the transposed matrix criterium _ overestimates the separable region _",
    "( i.e. , _ underestimates the quantum entangled region _ ) less or equal than the conditional entropy criterium .",
    "it could well be that whenever both criteria produce the same result , this result is the exact answer .",
    "let us now focus on the critical - phenomenon - like scenario we have previously announced .",
    "its possibility was introduced in @xcite but it was not exhibited for any case .",
    "let us do this here for the @xmath132 particular case . as a function of @xmath122 we have numerically calculated the value @xmath148 at which @xmath92 vanishes and its associated derivative @xmath149 , as well as the inflexion point of @xmath92 versus @xmath15 ( see examples in figs . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the abcissa and ordinate corresponding to the inflexion point are noted respectively @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "these quantities , as well as @xmath148 and @xmath149 , are represented in fig .",
    "we see that @xmath148 diverges for @xmath152 ( _ separable state _ ) , and decreases from infinity to zero when @xmath122 increases from 1/3 to unity ( _ entangled state _ ) .",
    "it is therefore convenient to define @xmath153 , which increases from zero to unity when @xmath122 increases from 1/3 to unity ( see fig .",
    "4(a ) ) . this line plays a role analogous to a critical line , separating the unit square in the @xmath154 space into two regions , respectively corresponding to the separable and entangled states .",
    "this possible interpretation is one of the two scenarios advanced in @xcite , and seems more appropriate than the other scenario , in which a line in the @xmath154 space was thought as a critical phenomenon order parameter . in the present scenario ,",
    "we need to define an order parameter @xmath155 , as well as a  thermodynamically conjugate \" parameter @xmath156 , such that the  susceptibility \" @xmath157 diverges ( presumably with the same critical exponent ) when the critical line is approached from _ both _ sides .",
    "furthermore , we would need to identify the  symmetry \" which is broken at the critical line .",
    "naturally , @xmath158 is expected to vanish in the entire separable state , and increase from zero at the critical line ( in the @xmath154 space ) up to unity for @xmath159 .",
    "it is even plausible that @xmath160 , whereas @xmath161 would continuously increase from zero to unity when @xmath122 increases from 1/3 to unity .",
    "if this is so , we would have a nonuniform convergence feature , more precisely @xmath162 while @xmath163 . at the other end of the critical line",
    ", convergence would be uniform , i.e. , @xmath164 .",
    "finally , quantum entanglement should disappear in all cases , i.e. , at all values of @xmath154 , in the classical limit , i.e. , when planck constant @xmath165 vanishes .",
    "consistently , it should be possible to present the quantity @xmath166 as the proportionality factor of some other intrinsically quantum quantity @xmath167 , i.e. , we should have @xmath168 .",
    "indeed , such a form would imply that @xmath167 vanishes for @xmath169 , and is finite for _ any _ value of @xmath170 .",
    "obviously , this scenario needs further analysis , which would be welcome .",
    "we have analyzed classical systems and have seen , along khinchin - abe lines@xcite , how the @xmath15-generalization of shannon s celebrated property ( eq .",
    "( 2 ) ) naturally leads to a pseudo - extensive property involving conditional entropies ( eqs .",
    "( 13 ) and ( 16 ) ) , which in turn recovers as particular case the well known pseudo - extensive property ( eq . ( 17 ) ) of entropies associated with independent systems . such conditional entropies , when maintained in form for the quantum case@xcite , enable what appears to be a necessary condition for separability .",
    "this condition seems to generically be coincident or slightly less restrictive than peres criterium based on the partially transposed density matrix .",
    "the latter , also a necessary condition in general , occasionally is sufficient as well , like in the simple mixed state of two spins 1/2 ( see @xcite for details ) .    for the two spins 1/2 mixed state characterized by @xmath132 , both entropic and transposed matrix criteria yield the exact answer of the problem .",
    "we have exhibited that , through special values of the conditional entropy @xmath140 as a function of @xmath15 , quantum separability ( hence local realism ) presents some analogies with standard critical phenomena .",
    "indeed , a line quite analogous to a critical one emerges in the @xmath171 space ( with @xmath172 ) , which becomes divided into two regions , namely the separable one and the entangled one ( which includes as its most entangled state the epr one ) . within this standpoint ,",
    "it becomes clear that the boltzmann - gibbs - shannon entropy ( @xmath173 ) is a concept too poor for properly discussing quantum entanglement , a conclusion recently reached also by brukner and zeilinger@xcite from a different path . obviously , in the more complex cases where the present entropic criterium does not provide the exact answer ( but only an upper bound of it )",
    ", the present considerations should have to be appropriately adapted .",
    "but , on qualitative grounds , the situation is expected to be essentially the same .",
    "the possibility explored here ( alternative to the one preliminary sketched in @xcite ) where curves in the @xmath174 space appear as analogous to critical lines emerged during discussions with r. horodecki , p. horodecki and m. horodecki , to whom one of us ( ct ) is grateful .",
