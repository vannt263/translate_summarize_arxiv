    "orbit interaction ( soi ) in semiconductor two dimensional ( 2d ) structures is mostly due to its potential application to the spin  based electronic devices @xcite .",
    "there are two main types of soi in the quantum well based on zinc  blende  lattice semiconductors .",
    "first , the dresselhaus interaction @xcite that originates from the bulk inversion asymmetry ( bia ) ; second , the rashba interaction @xcite induced by structural inversion asymmetry ( sia ) of the confining field of a quantum well .",
    "both of these interactions lead to the momentum - dependent spin splitting of the electron energy spectrum and to the formation of quantum states with the hard linked spatial and spin degrees of freedom of the electrons .",
    "they are responsible for many interesting effects in the transport phenomena like beatings in the shubnikov  de haas ( sdh ) oscillations @xcite ; weak antilocalization @xcite ; current  induced non ",
    "equilibrium spin polarization @xcite ; spin hall effect @xcite , and so on .    at present",

    "latexmath:[$\\omega_{c}^{}=    electron scattering time . as for theoretical studies of the considered systems in strong , and especially in quantizing @xmath2 magnetic fields , there is still no satisfactory analytical description of the kinetic phenomena even in the usual diffusive regime ( without quantum corrections ) .",
    "the complex form of the eigenspinors and energy spectrum of an electron in the presence of soi and a strong magnetic field @xcite is the main cause of such a situation .",
    "direct employment of this basis forces one to proceed almost right from the start to the numerical analysis of very cumbersome expressions @xcite .",
    "the strong magnetic field is however one of the most efficient tools for investigation of soi @xcite and manipulation of the spin degrees of freedom in the semiconductor 2d  structures .",
    "thus , a rather simple theoretical description of the kinetic phenomena in the 2d systems with soi in a strong orthogonal magnetic field becomes a necessity . in the present work ,",
    "we consider the problem of calculation of the longitudinal and hall resistances of a 2d rashba system in the ladder approximation assuming that the electron momentum relaxation is due to elastic scattering by short  range impurities which is taken into account in the born approximation .",
    "we have found the _ exact _",
    "relation between the one  particle green function ( gf ) of the rashba 2d  electron in an arbitrary orthogonal magnetic field and the well known gf of an `` ideal '' electron , that is an electron with the ideal value of the zeeman coupling @xmath4 and without soi .",
    "this allows one to obtain the analytical expressions for the density of states ( dos ) in the self ",
    "consistent born approximation ( scba ) , and the conductivity tensor @xmath5 in the ladder approximation .",
    "the total dos in scba is defined as the sum of the partial dos s of two spin  split subbands . at the same time ,",
    "conductivity in ladder approximation looks as if the current were generated by charge carriers of one type with the total concentration @xmath6 and mobility @xmath7 .",
    "these expressions hold good in a wide range , from the classically weak magnetic fields @xmath1 up to the quantizing ones @xmath8 . on the basis of these results , we perform the numerical analysis of the beatings of the sdh oscillations of the considered kinetic coefficients , as well as of their behavior in the classical magnetic fields region .",

    "so , a more correct expression for the dos is needed , which adequately describes its behavior not only in the vicinity of the fermi level @xmath115 , but also near the lower boundary of the spectrum .",
    "for example , at @xmath45 we have @xmath116 in the energy interval @xmath117 , the dos is formed by the states of the lower spin - split subband and has the typical one  dimensional behavior . integrating ( [ eq : dos_zero ] ) between @xmath118 and @xmath119",

    ", the oscillations of the dos are determined completely by the first term in eq .",

    "then , the location of the @xmath132-th node of beatings is determined by the condition @xmath133    this limit was considered in ref .  .",
    "unlike the results of that work , the above  obtained equations still stand in the case of strong soi , where it is important to take account of the difference @xmath123 and @xmath119 for correctly defining the sdg oscillation period .",
    "in addition , we have taken into account the zeeman splitting of the electron spectrum that allows to describe more correctly the oscillation pattern .",
    "for example , the eq .",
    "( [ eq : node ] ) allows us to determine both the spin ",

    "on the other hand , the spin precession frequency @xmath77 approaches @xmath134 as the magnetic field @xmath135 increases .",
    "therefore , in this case a gradual transition from the beatings of the sdh oscillations to the familiar zeeman splitting of the oscillating peaks should be observed .",

    "another important characteristic of the one  electron states of the 2d rashba system is the difference of the partial dos s with opposite spin projections onto the @xmath141axis @xmath142 this quantity is proportional to the derivative of the transverse spin magnetization with respect to energy @xmath64 and , therefore , it enters in the definition of the effective concentrations of current carriers in the dissipative part of the 2d rashba system conductivity in an orthogonal magnetic field ( see the next section ) .",
    "evidently , the difference of the partial dos s ( [ eq : ddos ] ) vanishes in the region of classical magnetic fields ( @xmath143 ) , but it plays an important role in the sdh oscillations regime . in the case of large filling factors , the oscillating behavior of this quantity is described by the following expression @xmath144 unlike the total dos ( [ eq : dos_sdh ] ) , this expression contains just one oscillating term , because @xmath145 does not depend on the effective masses @xmath112 ( [ eq : eff_mass ] ) .",
    "indeed , the difference of the partial dos s @xmath145 is non zero , which is entirely due to the spin degrees of freedom of the electrons .",
    "the typical sdh oscillation patterns of @xmath145 are depicted in fig .",

    "( [ eq : renorm ] ) . indeed , eq .  ( [ eq : node ] ) determines the location of the beating loops of the oscillation instead of the nodes .",
    "thus , the broadening of the zeeman levels leads to observable supression of the beatings of the electron life time @xmath146 oscillations .",
    "the general expression for the conductivity ( [ eq : kubo ] ) consists of two different terms .",
    "the first of them describes the contribution of the electrons at the fermi level , the second one contains the contributions of all filled states below the fermi level .",

    "this would be expected , because the conductivity tensor in the absence of a magnetic field is diagonal in the original spin space ( @xmath187 ) by virtue of the momentum parity of the gf s , and the full conductivity is equal to @xmath188 @xcite . in the classical ( nonquantizing )",
    "magnetic fields this property is retained , since the difference of the partial dos s with opposite spin projections onto the @xmath141axis ( [ eq : ddos ] ) is equal to zero in this region ( see fig .  1 ) .    of course , the simple structure of eq .",
    "( [ eq : total_sigma ] ) for the conductivity breaks down in the region of sufficiently strong magnetic fields , @xmath189 , where the contribution @xmath190 to the inverse life time of the one  electron states ( [ eq : renorm ] ) can not already be neglected . as shown in the previous section , this may lead to in flattening of the sdh oscillation beatings ( see fig .",
    "therefore we believe the approximation used in this section @xmath191 to be correct in the magnetic field region where well  defined beating nodes of magnetooscillation are observed .",
    "first of all , let us summarize briefly the main results obtained in this work .",
    "we have shown that the eigenstates of the 2d rashba electron in an orthogonal magnetic field are characterized by a special motion integral ( [ eq : helic_oper ] ) that generalizes the notion of _ helicity _ @xcite .",
    "using this fact , we have found the relation ( [ eq : gf_repres ] ) between the gf s of the 2d rashba electron and the `` ideal '' one that holds good for arbitrary orthogonal magnetic fields as well as for the strong spin  orbit coupling . with the help of this relation , we have obtained , in contrast to refs .  , the analytical expressions for the dos in scba ( [ eq : dos_scba ] ) and for the magnetoconductivity in the ladder approximation ( [ eq : total_sigma ] ) of the 2d rashba system that are valid in a wide range from the classical magnetic fields up to the quantizing ones ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "the spin  orbit as well as the zeeman splitting of the electron energy are properly allowed for in these expressions , unlike the results of refs .  . in particular",
    ", we have obtained a simple expression ( [ eq : node ] ) for the nodes locations of the sdh oscillations beatings .",
    "we have shown that the competition of the relaxation rates of the orbital and spin degrees of freedom in the total inverse life time @xmath193 of the one  electron states in the @xmath102th subband leads to the partial supression of beatings of the @xmath193 sdh oscillations .",
    "we start the discussion of the results with the conductivity in the classical magnetic fields region ( @xmath194 ) . in this case",
    ", it follows immediately from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : n_p ] ) , and ( [ eq : total_sigma ] ) that the conductivity of a 2d rashba system takes the usual drude",
    " boltzmann form @xmath195 where @xmath196 is the drudian conductivity in absence of the magnetic field ; @xmath197 is the life time of an one  electron state at @xmath45 .",
    "it immediately follows that in the ladder approximation the classical magnetoresistance of a 2d rashba system is zero , @xmath198 , and the hall coefficient @xmath199 .",
    "thus , in the ladder approximation the rashba spin ",
    "orbit interaction has _ no effect at all _ on the conductivity magnitude everywhere over the region of classical magnetic fields , @xmath194 ( including the case of @xmath45 ) .",
    "note that the first relation for the drudian conductivity ( [ eq : zero_cond ] ) formally coincides with that obtained in ref .  .",
    "however , as mentioned above , the correction @xmath200 to the fermi energy does not lead to an observable change in @xmath0 , since it is absorbed by the normalization condition ( [ eq : zero_norm ] ) .",
    "let us proceed now to the discussion of the magnetotransport in the 2d rashba system in the the large filling factors @xmath106 region , where the scba and the ladder approximation are applicable to the description of the one  electron states and kinetic phenomena , respectively .",
    "as usual , we extract in the linear approximation the oscillating parts of the conductivity that enter through dos into the effective concentration @xmath159 ( [ eq : n_p ] ) and mobility @xmath7 . as in the ladder approximation",
    "the conductivity ( [ eq : total_sigma ] ) has the form characteristic of a conductor with one type of charge carriers , we can immediately use the expression obtained in ref .   for the oscillating parts of the longitudinal resistance @xmath201 and the hall coefficient @xmath202      here , @xmath204 and @xmath205 are the resistance ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : zero_cond ] ) ) and hall coefficient in zero magnetic field , respectively .",
    "thus , in the linear approximation the sdh oscillations @xmath201 and @xmath202 are entirely determined by the magnetic  field dependence of the dos , @xmath206 , the first harmonics of which are of the form ( [ eq : dos_sdh ] ) . from this",
    "we can draw two conclusions that are of great importance for an adequate interpretation of the sdh oscillation pattern in systems with spin  orbit interaction .",
    "first , the period of the sdh oscillations of @xmath201 and @xmath202 is defined by energy @xmath121 , and not by the fermi energy @xmath119 , as was stated in refs .  .",
    "from this and the normalization condition ( [ eq : zero_norm ] ) it follows that the sdh oscillation period is related to the total charge carriers concentration @xmath6 by the well known formula @xmath207 that holds true irrespective of the magnitude of the spin ",
    "orbit interaction constant .",
    "second , the sdh oscillation beating period is defined by the magnetic  field  dependent spin precession frequency @xmath208 ( see .",
    "( [ eq : spin_preces ] ) ) . from this",
    "it follows a simple equation for the beating nodes location @xmath209 ( [ eq : node ] ) that allows the constants @xmath21 and @xmath11 to be found from the measured @xmath209 values .",
    "this is illustrated fig .",
    "4 which presents the results of least  squares fitting of eq .",
    "( [ eq : node ] ) in variables @xmath210 , @xmath211 to the measured @xcite locations of the sdh oscillation beating nodes of the longitudinal resistance of a @xmath212type heterostructure .",
    "the slope of the fitted straight line and the point of its intersection with the ordinate axis yield the values @xmath213 and @xmath214 for the spin precession frequency in the absence of magnetic field and the @xmath11factor , respectively .",
    "this values are in good agreement with the results @xmath215 and @xmath216 obtained in ref .  .",
    "it should be stressed that @xmath217 only at @xmath218 . only in this case",
    "the beating nodes locations are strictly periodic in the reverse magnetic field and are described by the condition @xmath219 obtained in refs .  .",
    ", of the sdh oscillation beating nodes as compared to the behavior predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : node ] ) .",
    "the points correspond to the values @xmath220 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 , measured for the @xmath226heterostructure @xcite .",
    "the straight line is the result of least  squares fitting of eq .",
    "( [ eq : node ] ) . ]    using eq .",
    "( [ eq : total_sigma ] ) , we have performed numeric analysis of the sdh oscillations of the longitudinal resistance @xmath201 ( fig .  5 ) and the hall coefficient @xmath202 ( fig .",
    "6 ) for parameters ( @xmath227 , and @xmath228 ) corresponding to the gate voltages @xmath229 and @xmath230 for the @xmath16heterostructure investigated in ref .  .",
    "the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath231 were calculated from the positions of two successive nodes @xmath232 , and @xmath233 , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : node ] ) , while @xmath234 was adjusted to the sdh oscillation period . at @xmath235 ,",
    "the calculated value @xmath236 is close to the result @xmath237 of ref .  18 , whereas at @xmath238 , the calculated value @xmath239 is in excellent agreement with the value @xmath240 obtaned in ref .  .",
    "the results of @xmath201 calculation are compared in fig .  5 to the experimental curves from ref .  .",
    "it can be seen that the theoretical results reproduce well the period and beating nodes location of the measured magnetoresistance oscillations .",
    "some difference in oscillation amplitude is due to the fact that the temperature smearing of the fermi level was not taking into account in our analysis for simplicity .",
    "the negative magnetoresistance observed in ref .",
    "lies outside the ladder approximation .",
    "magnetooscillation as compared with the measured @xcite results for the @xmath241heterostructure at gate voltages @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "the experimental data are denoted by the thick solid line and the theoretical ones by thin solid line . ]      in conclusion it should be stressed once more that the results of this work have been obtained with rigorous account taken of both the spin  orbit and zeeman splitting of the energy levels .",
    "up till now this was made by using numeric analysis only @xcite .",
    "our results reproduce quantitatively all the peculiarities of the magnetooscillation curves obtained in such a way for models with rashba spin ",
    "orbit interaction @xcite , except for the anomalously large positive magnetoresistance obtained in ref .  .",
    "our conclusion about the absence of positive magnetoresistance is in drastic contradiction with ref .  , but agrees with the results of analytical @xcite and recent numerical @xcite studies .",
