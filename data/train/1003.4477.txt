    "the semiclassical character of the detector , usually named after unruh - dewitt , relies on the fact that , while it possesses a well - defined _ classical _ world line , its internal degrees of freedom are treated _ quantum mechanically _",

    "the smooth compact support real - valued function @xmath17 is introduced to keep the detector switched on for a finite amount of proper time @xmath18 , which will be always assumed to have a fixed nonzero value here , and @xmath19 is a smooth compact support complex - valued function modeling the fact that the detector only interacts with the field in a neighborhood of its world line .",
    "the total hamiltonian can be cast as @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the free scalar field hamiltonian . by using the interaction picture ,",
    "the final state of the qubit - field system in first perturbation order is given by  @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the corresponding initial state , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the difference between the advanced and retarded green functions , @xmath28 is an operator that takes the positive frequency part of the solutions of the klein - gordon equation with respect to the timelike isometry , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the annihilation and creation operators of @xmath31 modes , respectively .",
    "equation  ( [ primeira_ordem_2 ] ) carries the physical message that the excitation and de - excitation of an unruh - dewitt detector following a timelike isometry is associated with the absorption and emission , respectively , of a particle as naturally  defined by observers co - moving with the detector . only processes where the detector flips once or none at all are considered here .",
    "let us now consider two non - interacting qubits in minkowski space - time . the one carried by alice",

    "because each detector excitation and de - excitation in the usual inertial vacuum is necessarily associated with the emission of a minkowski particle , inertial observers must discard data coming from experiments where two or more minkowski particles are eventually left by using some post - selection process .",
    "accordingly , uniformly accelerated observers must also discard data associated with two or more detector transitions .",
    "in classical information theory , the correlation between two random variables @xmath59 and @xmath60 is measured by the mutual information  @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the usual shannon entropy for the variable @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the corresponding joint entropy . here",

    "it is reasonable to assume that they add in a simple way  @xcite .",
    "hence , we can define the quantum part of the total correlation as @xmath78 note that we are using here the two - side  correlation measure ( in the sense that both subsystems are measured )  @xcite , instead of the one - side  correlation measure as assumed in the quantum discord  @xcite .",
    "this choice relies on the fact that the alice - rob problem considered in this article is not symmetric under the permutation of the subsystems , since alice and rob are inertial and noninertial , respectively .    for the sake of completeness",
    ", we compare the results obtained by means of eq .",
    "( [ qc ] ) with those obtained through the quantum discord @xmath79 here @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the quantum extension of the classical conditional entropy @xmath82 , which ( in the quantum case ) depends on the measurement choice .",
    "thus , to compute the quantum discord , we have to maximize this quantity over the set @xmath83 of all possible projective measurements on subsystem @xmath60 .",
    "of course , there is a related one - side measure of classical correlation given by @xmath84 .",

    "first , we note that for null acceleration the total correlation value given by the quantum mutual information differs from @xmath0 , as would be expected for the singlet state  ( [ is ] ) .",
    "this is so because even inertial detectors have a nonzero probability of spontaneously decaying ( along the nonzero time interval @xmath18 ) with the emission of a minkowski particle , which carries away some information .",
    "such a process leads to a purity loss of the initial singlet state degradating the initial correlations .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize that the usual value of 2 for the quantum mutual information of the singlet state is obtained when the effective coupling constant @xmath46 vanishes , as can be seen from fig .",
    "2 . in such a case",
    "there is no interaction between rob 's qubit and the scalar field .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows that the two - qubit system is still left with classical correlations in the limit of infinite acceleration ( @xmath57 ) , while the quantum correlation vanishes .",
    "this fact is in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ assimpt ] ) and , as mentioned before , this is a consequence of our detector model . * *  * * from the point of view of uniformly accelerated observers , the loss of quantum correlation is due to the interaction of rob s qubit with the unruh thermal bath of rindler particles that they experience when the field is in the minkowski vacuum .",
    "we recall that the unruh temperature experienced by the non - inertial qubit is proportional to its proper acceleration . now from the inertial observers perspective , the quantum correlation is carried away by the scalar radiation emitted by the accelerating qubit when it suffers a transition .",
    "another interesting result revealed by fig .  [ fig1 ] is the fact that the dynamics of both classical and quantum correlations can not be described by a smooth function of acceleration .",
    "extensive numerical analyses indicate that this _ sudden change _ does not depend on the considered initial state .",

    "a similar behavior is observed when we plot the same correlations as functions of @xmath46 for a fixed value of acceleration , as seen in fig .",
    "the larger the acceleration , the closer to the origin the sudden - change point approaches . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we show how the sudden - change point depends on the parameters @xmath86 and @xmath46 .",
    "it becomes clear that the quantum correlation vanishes for every @xmath46 value provided that the acceleration is arbitrarily large .",
    "figures  [ fig4 ] and  [ fig5 ] show the classical correlation  ( [ cc ] ) and quantum mutual information  ( [ qmi ] ) , respectively .",

    "<S> we use the unruh effect to analyze the dynamics of classical and quantum correlations for a two - qubit system when one of them is uniformly accelerated for a finite amount of proper time . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the quantum correlation is completely destroyed in the limit of infinite acceleration , while the classical one remains nonzero . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that such correlations exhibit the so - called _ sudden - change _ behavior as a function of acceleration . </S>",
