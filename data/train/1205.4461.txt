    "eit is a quantum interference process where two excitation pathways of a 3-level system interfere to produce transmission on an atomic resonance @xcite .",
    "the quantum interference produces a dark state that does not absorb light under normal resonance conditions .",
    "since eit depends on quantum interference between 2 excitation pathways , eit is exquisitely sensitive to phase disturbances , transitions out of the participating states and energy level shifts of the 3 level system .",
    "the addition of an rf electric field that is resonant with a nearby rydberg transition , a 4th level , for the scheme shown in figure  [ fig : figure1]a , breaks the symmetry of the eit interference and can produce a spectrally sharp bright resonance within the eit lineshape . the ability to detect a lineshape change of the eit transmission window",
    "is only limited by the laser linewidths , transit time broadening , shot noise and the decay and dephasing rates of the rydberg states involved in the eit process .",
    "the strength of the effect depends on the coupling to the rf electric field which is determined by the rabi frequency of the transition , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the amplitude of the rf electric field and @xmath14 is the transition dipole moment .",
    "although technically challenging , it is possible , theoretically , to make rf electric field measurements at rf electric field strengths @xmath15nv@xmath1@xmath4 .",
    "we know of no other atom based rf electric field sensor that relies on a quantum interferometric readout such as the one we have described here .",
    "rydberg atoms are highly excited atoms which are characterized by their principle quantum number @xmath16 , and have long lifetimes @xcite .",
    "the transition dipole moment between neighboring rydberg states scales as @xmath17 and can be extremely large , @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "the sensitivity to rf electric fields , then , is resonantly enhanced for frequencies in the range of 1 - 500@xmath1ghz , as there are many resonant electric dipole transitions between rydberg states in this frequency band . because the rf electric field couples 2 close lying rydberg states with a large transition dipole moment , @xmath20 can be large , @xmath10mhz , when the rf electric field is weak . as an example , consider the @xmath21rb @xmath22 transition at a frequency of @xmath23ghz . a beam intensity of @xmath24fw@xmath1@xmath25 corresponding to an rf electric field amplitude of @xmath26v@xmath1@xmath4 yields @xmath27mhz .",
    "a small rf electric field amplitude results in a signal that is straightforward to observe with current frequency stabilized diode lasers and room temperature vapor cells .    because each atom is identical in structure our approach uses each noninteracting , independent atom that participates as an identical , stable quantum sensor of the electric field .",
    "the device is traceable because its sensitivity is directly linked to the properties of the atom , namely the atomic rydberg wave functions or dipole moments which are well - known and can be determined even more precisely with modern spectroscopy , for example using frequency combs and ultracold atoms to better determine the rydberg atom quantum defects .",
    "the properties of rydberg atoms are readily calculated to high precision .",
    "dipole moments can currently be determined to a level of @xmath28 @xcite , suggesting the rydberg atomic dipole moments can be determined to @xmath29 part in @xmath30 using current methods .",
    "measured probe laser transmission curves as a function of probe laser detuning for the 4-level system found in figure  [ fig : figure1]a are shown in figure  [ fig : figure2 ] . traces for several different rf electric field amplitudes are displayed . at small rf electric field amplitudes ,",
    "figure  [ fig : figure2]a , the microwaves cause a broadening and reduction of the peak eit transmission signal .",
    "the linewidth of the eit transmission window is @xmath31mhz , while the relative drift of the coupling and probe lasers is @xmath32mhz determined from the measurements in the absence of an rf electric field . at intermediate rf electric field amplitudes , an absorption dip corresponding to the bright resonance appears within the eit transmission window .",
    "the frequency for the transition is calculated to be @xmath33ghz using the quantum defects from @xcite , in agreement with the experimentally observed frequency of @xmath34ghz . at large rf electric field amplitudes ,",
    "figure  [ fig : figure2]b , the eit transmission peak is split by the rf electric field . in this case",
    ", the peak splitting can be interpreted as autler - townes splitting of the @xmath35 state and is relatively large because the calculated transition dipole moment for this transition is large , @xmath36 . for comparison , @xmath37 is more than three orders of magnitude larger than the transition dipole moments on the coupling and probe transitions . without doppler averaging the splitting of the peaks in figure  [ fig",
    ": figure2]b is equal to the autler - townes splitting of the states , @xmath38 .",
    "doppler averaging changes the splitting of the peaks by the ratio of the probe laser to coupling laser wavelength . in our case , with @xmath39 nm and @xmath40 nm , the doppler averaged peaks are separated by @xmath41 . in a vapor cell ,",
    "the ratio of these wavelengths needs to be known accurately to make precise measurements of the rf electric field .",
    "the d2 transition wavelength is known to 1 part in @xmath42 @xcite and wavelengths can be determined to 1 part in @xmath30 with commercial laboratory wavemeters , so this effect is not limiting at this point . using the autler - townes splitting and the calculated transition dipole moment ,",
    "the electric field inside the cell is known with an uncertainty of @xmath43 , determined , in our case , by the precision with which the splitting can be measured .",
    "the rf electric field strengths obtained in this way are in agreement with those calculated using the parameters of the resonant horn antenna including its position relative to the rb vapor cell .",
    "the difference between the two calculations is @xmath44 .",
    "we believe the difference between the calculated and measured rf electric fields is mainly due to the uncertainty associated with the characterization of the horn antenna .",
    "density matrix calculations for the 4-level system are also shown in figure  [ fig : figure2 ] .",
    "the agreement between the 4-level theoretical calculations and the data show that the system is modeled well .",
    "our full 52-level density matrix calculations which include all of the hyperfine states , @xmath45 , of each of the participating levels , show that the populations of states @xmath35 and @xmath46 get optically pumped into the stretched @xmath47 and @xmath48 states , respectively , consistent with other works @xcite .",
    "our 4-level model uses these states for calculating the angular part of the transition dipole moment .",
    "the attenuation and splitting of the eit transmission peak shown in figure  [ fig : figure2 ] is the signal we propose to use to precisely measure rf electric fields .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure3]a shows the peak height of the eit transmission window as a function of rf electric field strength . in this experiment the lasers are locked to the eit peak and the rf electric field strength is swept in time while the transmission of the probe beam is monitored .",
    "the red line shows the 4-level density matrix calculation for this range of rf electric field strengths . for these microwave fields the probe transmission increases from the 3-level eit value .",
    "a maximum increase of @xmath49 is shown in figure  [ fig : figure3]a . for our experimental parameters and",
    "rf electric field amplitudes less than 1400 @xmath50v @xmath51 , the probe transmission is increased in the presence of the microwaves with a maximum at @xmath52v@xmath1@xmath4 .",
    "the increase in probe transmission is a result of the doppler effect .",
    "when the rf electric field is small , the coupling to @xmath46 is small and there is little population in this state .",
    "however , because the rf electric field wavelength is comparatively long and therefore less sensitive to doppler shifts , the dominant effect of the microwave field is to shift , on average , the atoms participating in the eit to smaller 2 photon detunings .",
    "this increases the eit transmission signal on resonance .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure3]b shows a plot of the calculated probe transmission as a function of velocity for @xmath53mhz and @xmath54mhz to illustrate this effect . although the probe transmission is suppressed for atoms near zero velocity , the suppression is more than made up for by the increased participation of atoms in the wings of the line .",
    "the position of the peak transmission in figure  [ fig : figure3]a can be shifted by changing either the probe or coupling rabi frequency .    figure  [ fig : figure4 ] shows the central result of this paper . in figure  [ fig : figure4]a , a series of traces of the change in probe laser transmission as a function of rf electric field frequency are presented for various rf electric field amplitudes .",
    "the microwave frequency is scanned 20 mhz in 200 ms to acquire these traces .",
    "the probe and coupling lasers are locked on the eit transmission resonance .",
    "the increased transmission is due to the resonant microwave field and not an off - resonant ac stark shift .",
    "when the microwave power is held constant and the rf electric field frequency is scanned over the @xmath55 resonance , the maximum signal occurs at the experimental transition frequency , @xmath34ghz .",
    "the smallest detected rf electric field shown in figure  [ fig : figure4 ] is @xmath56v@xmath1@xmath4 .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure4]b shows the probe transmission peak heights as a function of rf electric field amplitude compiled for the data shown in figure  [ fig : figure4]a .",

    "@xmath57v@xmath1@xmath4 the maximum probe transmission signal decays smoothly , as seen in figure  [ fig : figure4]b .    to obtain an estimate of the sensitivity of our current apparatus , we measured the probe transmission on the eit resonance and compared the signal in the cases where the rf electric field was on and then off .",
    "the coupling laser was modulated at @xmath58khz while the rf electric field was modulated at @xmath59hz .",
    "the signal was processed in 2 different lock - in amplifiers with an overall detection system integration time of @xmath60s . for a signal to noise ratio of @xmath61",
    ", we were able to measure an rf electric field amplitude of @xmath62v@xmath1@xmath4 .",
    "the measurement corresponds to a sensitivity of @xmath63v@xmath1@xmath64 .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated a new method for rf electrometry based on measuring a bright resonance in a thermal atomic vapor .",
    "this method is based on setting up each participating atom as a quantum interferometer . using our approach",
    ", we were able to demonstrate a sensitivity to rf electric fields of @xmath0v@xmath1@xmath11 with a very modest setup , commonly found in modern atomic physics laboratories .",
    "we were able to detect rf electric fields as small as @xmath3v@xmath1@xmath4 .",
    "the smallest detectable rf electric field amplitude demonstrated is below current antenna based standards used for rf electric field sensing and calibration .",
    "in addition , our method minimally perturbs the rf electric field , is a direct measure of the rf electric field linked to the rydberg atom transition dipole moments , and is resonantly enhanced to give some immunity to out of band interference .",
    "there are many rydberg atom transition frequencies in the range of @xmath65ghz that can be utilized for electric field amplitude measurements .",
    "the current apparatus can be improved in many ways , including the use of lasers with narrower spectral bandwidth , the use of frequency modulated spectroscopy , the implementation of lower noise photo - detectors , and the use of the dispersive nature of the sharp resonances used in our experiments . in addition , we speculate that if the technique is pushed to the quantum limit it may be possible to improve it by squeezing .",
    "we are currently focussing on using the refractive index changes associated with the narrow resonances observed in the 4-level system to improve our sensitivity .",
    "one can envision that these improvements , as well as a more detailed understanding of the 4-level rydberg atom eit system , can push the limits of this technique to @xmath66nv@xmath1@xmath4 , at least for some rf electric field frequencies . now that quantum assisted sensing has been applied to rf electrometry , the outlook is bright for adopting such a method for future rf electric field standards .",
    "such a standard hinges on knowledge of the transition dipole moments of the atoms used for the experiments which can currently be determined at the @xmath28 level .",
    "the electric field can , in principle , then be measured to a precision of 1 part in @xmath30 using the autler - townes splitting of the rydberg transitions , figure  [ fig : figure2]b . in the future , rydberg atom transition dipole moments and the other transition dipole moments involved in the process used here can be determined to much higher precision than currently known using cold atoms and frequency combs to measure quantum defects and make high resolution stark shift measurements .",
    "these efforts may be catalyzed by efforts like ours to improve and adopt a quantum standard for rf electrometry .",
    "the 4 level energy level diagram for the atomic system used in the experiments is shown in figure  [ fig : figure1]a .",
    "the probe and coupling lasers counter propagate through a room temperature @xmath67 cm rb vapor cell .",
    "the atom density is kept low enough so that collisions do not play a significant role in the experiments . in particular",
