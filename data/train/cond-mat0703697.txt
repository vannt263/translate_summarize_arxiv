    "the potential energy of the electron in the single - electron approximation provides the theoretical foundation for most modeling and interpretation of the electronic energy bands of nonmagnetic semiconductors .",
    "implementations of this concept range in sophistication from simple empirical pseudopotentials @xcite to first - principles quasiparticle self - energies .",
    "@xcite modern research on semiconductor physics deals mainly with complex systems ( such as nanostructures and novel materials ) , although the spintronic properties of traditional semiconductors are also of strong current interest .",
    "it is therefore somewhat surprising that , in this day of supposedly advanced understanding , no clear physical picture exists of something so basic as the one - electron potential energy at an ideal gaas / alas or gainas / inp heterojunction .",
    "the key issue is the self - consistent redistribution of charge that must occur at any interface between two bulk semiconductors .",
    "first - principles numerical calculations based on density - functional theory and norm - conserving pseudopotentials @xcite are now routinely performed on small systems ( say , a few tens of atoms ) using personal computers and free software .",
    "@xcite however , such computations are still not feasible for large quantum dots and quantum wires .",
    "even if they were , there is no means at present for separating this information from a huge numerical calculation .",
    "that is , no one has yet demonstrated an accurate method for breaking down the self - consistent potential into simple conceptual units that can be used to _ understand _ the interface potential and model it using less numerically intensive methods ( such as empirical pseudopotentials or envelope - function theory ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the quadratic - response formalism developed in refs .   and provides a conceptually simple method for constructing the interface potential that is accurate to within a few mev in typical semiconductor heterostructures . in this approach ,",
    "the heterostructure is treated as a perturbation of a bulk reference crystal , and the self - consistent heterostructure potential is built up as a series of successively smaller corrections to the bulk potential .",
    "the leading term is the linear response , which has the form of a superposition of elementary quasi - atomic building blocks .",
    "this form is widely used in empirical pseudopotential models ( see the literature review in sec .  [",
    "sec : literature ] ) , but it is shown here to be accurate to only a few tens of mev . the quadratic response is then added in the form of _ diatomic _ building blocks , which are qualitatively different because they carry a dipole moment even in cubic semiconductors .",
    "numerical implementations of the theory are presented here for the paradigmatic common - atom and no - common - atom systems gaas / alas and in@xmath0ga@xmath1as / inp .",
    "the quadratic - response approximation for @xmath2 valence electrons is shown to be accurate to within about 2 mev for gaas / alas and 5 mev for in@xmath0ga@xmath1as / inp .    in typical heterostructures , the low - energy electron and hole states can be represented by slowly varying envelope functions .",
    "the properties of such states are determined by the pseudopotential not just at the bulk reciprocal - lattice vectors @xmath3 ( as would be the case in a bulk semiconductor ) , but throughout a small @xmath4-space neighborhood of each @xmath3 .",
    "within such a neighborhood , an analytic function of @xmath4 can be approximated using a power series ( which is equivalent to introducing a multipole expansion of a localized function in coordinate space ) .",
    "this paper also examines the accuracy of such power series and demonstrates that the truncated expansions introduced in refs .   and are sufficiently accurate for slowly varying envelope functions .",

    "two simple non - self - consistent models of the heterostructure pseudopotential are widely used .",
    "the simplest is the _ planar interface _ model , in which the potential is assumed to make an abrupt transition from one periodic bulk potential to another at some predefined interface plane .",
    "@xcite this requires as input only the bulk pseudopotential form factors .",
    "@xcite the assumption of a planar interface provides , in essence , a simple recipe for interpolating the pseudopotential in @xmath4 space between the bulk reciprocal - lattice vectors @xmath3 . a discontinuous potential is , however",
    ", clearly far from self - consistent ( since by poisson s equation it would require an infinite electron density ) , and a planar interface fails to account for the basic physics of the bonds between atoms at a no - common - atom interface .",
    "@xcite    an arguably more realistic potential ( although not all would agree@xcite ) is provided by the _ atomic superposition",
    "_ model , which is defined as a linear combination of screened atomic pseudopotentials .",
    "@xcite here the atomic potentials are assumed to be known as continuous functions of @xmath4 ; @xcite hence , no interpolation is required . in its simplest form",
    "this model may not accurately reproduce differences between bulk semiconductors , @xcite since ( for example ) the screened as pseudopotential obtained by fitting the properties of bulk gaas will generally differ from that obtained by fitting alas .",
    "however , mder and zunger have overcome this difficulty by using environment - dependent pseudopotentials , @xcite in which the replacement of one ga atom in gaas by al is accompanied by small changes in each of the four neighboring as pseudopotentials .",
    "the atomic pseudopotential and its associated nearest - neighbor perturbations may be grouped conceptually into a single quasi - atomic unit , which has the site symmetry @xmath5 of an al impurity in gaas rather than the spherical symmetry of an isolated al atom .",
    "thus , in this more general _ quasi - atomic superposition _ model , @xcite the heterostructure potential is constructed as a linear combination of quasi - atomic potentials , each of which has the site symmetry of a substitutional impurity .",
    "( the planar interface model may also be interpreted as a superposition of elementary units , @xcite but in this case the units do not have the atomic site symmetry . )    the superposition potential is also manifestly non - self - consistent , if only because the exchange - correlation potential is nonlinear .",
    "the assumption of linearity has important physical consequences . as shown in eq .",
    "( 10 ) of ref .  , one of these is the absence of direct @xmath6@xmath7 intervalley coupling in gaas / alas ( 001 ) heterostructures .",
    "the same conclusion was reached in ref . using a superposition of quasi - atomic potentials that were constructed by a different method .",
    "these conclusions were criticized by takhtamirov and volkov @xcite on the grounds that the true interface potential does not have the assumed form , and that there is consequently no basis for assuming @xmath6@xmath7 coupling to be any smaller than @xmath6@xmath8 coupling ( the latter of which is nonvanishing in the quasi - atomic superposition model@xcite ) .",
    "this criticism is , of course , entirely correct if the self - consistent interface potential is viewed as completely unknown .",
    "indeed , many derivations of envelope - function models are prefaced by a warning that the potential within a few lattice constants of the interface is too complicated for direct analysis , @xcite even in the case of an ideal interface ( i.e. , no interface roughness , defects , or interdiffusion ) . in early works",
    "it was sometimes concluded that the details of the interface potential have no significant influence on slowly varying envelope functions . today",
    ", however , it is widely accepted that these details are of critical importance in determining the strength of small symmetry - breaking interface terms in the hamiltonian , such as the above - mentioned intervalley mixing , @xcite valence - band mixing , @xcite and conduction- and valence - band rashba coupling @xcite ( see the following paper @xcite for further study of some of these topics ) . but the assumption that the self - consistent potential can not be understood in simple terms remains unchallenged by most envelope - function theorists .",
    "this problem was tackled in a landmark series of papers by baroni _ et al_. , who showed that linear - response theory is very successful in predicting valence - band offsets in semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "@xcite in this approach , the ionic pseudopotential of the heterostructure is treated as a perturbation of a bulk reference crystal .",
    "the linear response to this perturbation was shown to give accurate predictions for the valence - band offset ( within about 0.01 ev of the value obtained from a direct calculation , and in good agreement with experiment ) if the reference crystal was chosen to be the virtual - crystal average of the two bulk materials , since the quadratic response is then the same on both sides of the heterojunction and gives no contribution to the offset . however",
    ", if one is interested in the actual position - dependent potential , including the details of its behavior near the interface , the quadratic response is not generally negligible .",
    "nonlinear screened empirical pseudopotentials were introduced by magri and zunger , @xcite who extended the environment - dependent concept of mder and zunger @xcite to the no - common - atom inas / gasb system .",
    "nonlinearity arises in this case because the nearest - neighbor perturbations depend on which atoms occupy the neighboring sites .",
    "the pseudopotentials can therefore no longer be interpreted as purely quasi - atomic units ; a complete description requires the inclusion of nearest - neighbor _ diatomic _ building blocks as well .",
    "@xcite this represents an important conceptual advance in the modeling of heterostructure pseudopotentials .",
    "the present work develops this concept more thoroughly by extending the first - principles linear - response theory of baroni _",
    "et al_.@xcite to include the diatomic quadratic response for arbitrary pairs of atoms .",
    "the results show that the environment dependence of the empirical pseudopotentials in refs . and",
    "is qualitatively incomplete , since ( for example ) the leading contribution to @xmath6@xmath7 mixing in gaas / alas ( 001 ) superlattices arises from second - nearest - neighbor ga ",
    "( however , this contribution is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the linear response , which supports the conclusion that @xmath6@xmath7 mixing is much weaker than @xmath6@xmath8 mixing . )",
    "also , the diatomic nearest - neighbor response for no - common - atom systems calculated here has a dipole moment that generates long - range electric fields extending over the entire superlattice . such fields do not occur in the empirical pseudopotential interpolation scheme of magri and zunger , @xcite which produces only short - range potentials .",
    "this suggests that a more complete description of quadratic diatomic response may be of benefit in achieving more realistic empirical pseudopotentials .",
    "all of the numerical results in this paper are derived from plane - wave pseudopotential total - energy calculations @xcite performed using the abinit software .",
    "@xcite this package provides a variety of options , but the particular calculations reported here used the local density approximation ( lda ) to density - functional theory and the nonlocal norm - conserving pseudopotentials of hartwigsen , goedecker , and hutter @xcite with no spin - orbit coupling .    choosing a particular physical structure and a particular set of technical ingredients ( such as plane - wave kinetic - energy cutoffs and @xmath4-point sampling ) defines a model system whose properties can be calculated self - consistently to an accuracy approaching that of machine precision .",
    "these `` exact '' model calculations are used here and in the following paper @xcite as a benchmark for comparison with various approximations used in the construction of the first - principles envelope - function theory of ref .. the main objective of this paper is to pin down as closely as possible how much error arises from the quadratic - response approximation and the multipole expansions of the linear and quadratic response .",
    "the approximate potentials derived here are also used directly in a subsequent paper @xcite that examines the accuracy of first - principles envelope - function theory in superlattices .    with these goals in mind , relatively low kinetic - energy cutoffs ( see below ) and numbers of special @xmath4 points",
    "were chosen in order to make the `` exact '' calculations feasible for the large superlattices in which envelope - function theory is valid . in particular ,",
    "two independent @xmath4 points were used for gaas / alas superlattices with @xmath9 symmetry , while four points were used for in@xmath0ga@xmath1as / inp superlattices with @xmath10 symmetry .",
    "the total energy is not completely converged at these values , but the valence - band offsets calculated here are nevertheless in good agreement with experiment and with previous first - principles calculations reported in the literature .    in order to calculate multipole moments of the linear and quadratic response , it is necessary that the electron density and short - range potential response be well localized within the given large supercells . however",
    ", sharp cutoffs in the plane - wave basis produce spurious long - range gibbs oscillations that are very small but nonetheless large enough to completely swamp the physical multipole values . to suppress these oscillations , the smoothing functions shown in fig .",

    "the chosen kinetic - energy cutoff ( i.e. , the value at which the divisor in fig.[fig : gaas_kinetic_divisor ] goes to zero ) includes 283 plane waves at the @xmath11 point in bulk material ( 113 of which are not altered by smoothing ) and more than 14000 plane waves in a 96-atom superlattice .",
    "there are two conventions in the momentum - space total - energy formalism that determine the absolute value of the local potential .",
    "first , the mean value of the hartree potential is set to zero by definition : @xcite @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is the valence electron density ) , because in a neutral system the net contribution to the total energy from the coulomb interaction terms ( for the electron - ion system ) at wave vector @xmath14 is identically zero .    a similar convention @xcite is often used for the mean value of the short - range part of the local pseudopotential",
    "this is given by @xmath15 , where @xcite @xmath16 in which @xmath17 is the unit cell volume and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the local pseudopotential and valence charge of ion @xmath20 .",
    "the contribution from @xmath21 to the total energy is just the constant @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "hence , it is permissible to set @xmath21 to zero in the kohn - sham equations .",
    "@xcite    however , in order to calculate the nonlinear response correctly , @xmath21 must be included in the local pseudopotential . in the present work",
    ", @xmath21 was added to both the local pseudopotential and the energy eigenvalues after the conclusion of each self - consistent calculation .",
    "therefore , the absolute energy scale for all figures in this paper ( and the next@xcite ) is defined solely by the convention of setting the mean hartree potential to zero .",
