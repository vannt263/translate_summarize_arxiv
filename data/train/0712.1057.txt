    ", we employed a sigma  clipping algorithm to the distribution of @xmath5 m flux ratios .",

    "assuming that the color excesses observed are due to excess emission at 24 @xmath0 m , our 3@xmath10 detection limit of ( @xmath14 ) corresponds to a 13 % excess at 24 @xmath0 m compared to the expected photospheric emission ( @xmath15 ) .",

    "this small offset could be due to uncertainties in flux calibration as a function of integration time ( carpenter et al .",
    "2007 ; engelbracht et al . 2007 ) limits ) would result in identification of one new excess object ( hd 43989 , 30100 myr old ) and removal of [ pz99 ]",
    "161618.0 - 233947 from table 1 . ] . as a result ,",
    "the errors quoted on the reported excesses include the random errors in the @xmath5 m ratio ( typically 12 % ) , as well as the dispersion in our estimate of the photospheric color ( 4.3 % ) rather than the error in the mean , added in quadrature .    in figure 2 , we present the fraction of stars exhibiting 24 @xmath0 m excess emission in our sample as a function of age .",
    "each bin spans a factor of 3 in age .",
    "the errors in the ordinate are poisson , computed following @xcite with excess fractions as follows : ( 5/30 ) for stars 310 myr , ( 9/48 ) for 1030 myr , ( 5/59 ) for 30100 myr , ( 9/62 ) for 100300 myr , ( 2/53 ) 3001000 myr , and ( 0/57 ) for stars 13 gyr old .",
    "the ks test suggests that the distributions of @xmath5 m flux ratios ( fig .",
    "1 ) for the sample @xmath2 300 myr ( n = 199 ) and those @xmath3 300 myr ( n = 110 ) are inconsistent with having been drawn from the same parent population ( p @xmath2 10@xmath17 ) .",
    "we note that the errors in age quoted above act to diffuse sources to younger as well as older ages . because there are",
    "more excess objects in younger bins , errors in age tend to increase the excess fractions at older ages . as a result ,",
    "the abrupt drop in the excess fraction at 300 myr may be even more dramatic than detected here .",
    "we associate the observed 24 @xmath0 m excess with dust debris generated through collisions of planetesimals .",
    "one of our excess stars identified in table i ( hd 12039 ) was studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "models of this debris disk ( with fractional 24 @xmath0 m excess @xmath18 ) suggested a dust mass of @xmath19 10@xmath20 m@xmath21 located between 46 au .",
    "the magnitude of all our detected 24 @xmath0 m excesses are within a a factor of @xmath22 3 ( relative to the photosphere ) compared to hd 12039 .",
    "results similar to ours , have been reported for samples of fgk stars in open clusters @xcite .",
    "our sample is comprised of 60 open cluster stars with discrete ages of 55 ( 5 members of ic 2602 ) , 90 ( 13 members of @xmath23 per ) , 110 ( 20 pleiades ) , and 600 myr ( 22 hyades ) , as well 249 field stars .",
    "we have analyzed the statistics for sub - samples where they overlap .",
    "while the excess fractions for open clusters with ages 30100 myr and 100300 myr are _ greater _ than the comparable field star samples(@xmath24 vs. @xmath25 and @xmath26 vs. @xmath27 respectively ) , the results are formally consistent with each other .",
    "this suggests that there is no strong dependence of debris disk evolution on star  forming environment , though larger samples could reveal a difference .",
    "a key question is whether stars observed to have excess at 24 @xmath0 m in one age bin are the same cohort of stars with 24 @xmath0 m excess in another . in other words ,",
    "do the same 1020 % of sun  like stars with excess evolve from one age bin to the next with a constant fraction ; or are they distinct groups of stars , that persist in the observed state for a short time ?",
    "our observations trace excess emission from 21.726.4 @xmath0 m toward stars lacking excess emission @xmath28 m ( corresponding to a lack of dust generating planetesimals inside 1 au @xcite ) .",
    "assuming blackbody emission from large grains implies dust at radii from @xmath19 47 au .",
    "maximum dust production during the evolution of a planetesimal swarm is thought to occur between runaway and chaotic growth when the largest planetesimals reach @xmath19 2000 km at a given radius @xcite .",
    "the timescale for this goes as @xmath29 where a is the orbital radius and @xmath30 is the mass surface density of solids in the disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "assuming @xmath31 , and that @xmath32 ( @xcite ) , a range of @xmath33 in radius corresponds to @xmath34 in time .",
    "thus the emission we observe might not persist over timescales much larger than our age bins.m excess emission @xmath35 in time , they also predict hot dust at smaller radii covering a wider range of radii than our observations imply . ]",
    "perhaps many stars go through this phase of 24 @xmath0 m excess , but at different times .",
    "a range of @xmath22 100 in initial mass surface density ( @xcite ) could translate into a range of @xmath22 100 in evolutionary timescales .",
    "if so , one might expect smaller excesses at later times ( produced by lower mass disks ) . in comparing the mean detected excess for stars 330 myr old ( 0.359 with @xmath10 = 0.199 ) with that for stars 30300 myr old ( 0.345 with @xmath10 = 0.116 )",
    ", we find no evidence that this is the case ( though the samples are dominated by stars lacking detectable excess ) .",
    "nevertheless , one might consider _ summing _ the fractions of stars with 24 @xmath0 m excess between 3 - 300 myr , resulting in an overall fraction of stars with evidence for terrestrial planet formation greater than 60 % ! averaging the results over factors of ten in age results in excess fractions of 18 , 12 , and 2 % at ages 330 myr , 30300 myr , and 0.33 gyr , implying at least 32 % of sun  like stars exhibit evidence for terrestrial planet formation ( provided that the epoch of 24 @xmath0 m excess emission lasts @xmath36 in age ) .",
    "we note that in this scenario , the planets formed later from lower mass disks will be smaller ( @xcite ) .",
    "results to date suggest that : a ) primordial disks between 0.3 - 3 au dissipate or agglomerate into larger bodies on timescales comparable to the cessation of accretion@xcite ; and b ) few stars harbor optically - thin inner disks between 3 - 30 myr @xcite . based on theoretical considerations",
    ", we expect that planetesimals belts evolved rapidly within 3 au .",
    "@xcite explore the evolution of 24 @xmath0 m excess emission around a sample of a stars observed with sst and iras .",
    "they deduce a characteristic timescale of 150 myr for strong excesses to decay .",
    "however , care must be taken in comparing these results to ours as : 1 ) the dust masses detected by rieke et al .",
    "are likely _ larger _ than the dust masses detected here ; and 2 ) similar temperature dust traces distinct radii for stars of different luminosity . in general , the fractional 24 @xmath0 m excesses around a stars are larger than around g stars .",
    "the observed duration of the excess phase for both samples is longer than expected if the emission results solely from dust production well inside 10 au .",
    "an important caveat to our results is that we have not assessed whether the 24 @xmath0 m excesses we have detected are tracing warm dust in the terrestrial planet zone , or the wien  side of the planck function from cooler dust .",
    "if , at 24 @xmath0 m , we are seeing cooler dust generated at radii beyond 10 au , we would expect to observe it at later times .",
    "we also note that the maximum excess ratios predicted by kenyon and bromley are larger than the excesses detected here .",
    "@xcite provide steady  state models of warm dust production around sun  like stars . on the basis of comparing the observed ir luminosity of several systems to these models as a function of age ,",
    "they conclude that most ( 5/8 ) of the stars exhibiting evidence for warm dust must be in a transient state of evolution and not participating in a steady  state collisional cascade .",
    "however , the three systems with ages @xmath2 300 myr ( one of which is hd 12039 ) can be explained with equilibrium models .",
    "global analysis of the sed for all sources identified here will be required to directly compare the evolutionary state of these systems with the models ( carpenter et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "more work is needed to define the transition from primordial to debris disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "given the short time expected for collisional evolution of inner planetesimals belts ( @xmath2 3 myr ) , and the 1 - 10 myr lifetime of primordial disks , it may be difficult to detect the onset of collisional evolution .",
    "we suggest that sst observations at 24 @xmath0 m can be interpreted as evidence for terrestrial planet formation occuring around many ( 1932 % ) , if not most ( 62 % ) , sun  like stars . this range is higher than the observed frequency of gas giant planets ( 6.612 % within 520 au @xcite ) but comparable to the inference that cool dust debris beyond 10 au might be very common @xcite .",
    "radial velocity monitoring of low mass stars , micro - lensing surveys , as well as transit surveys such as corot and kepler , will provide critical tests of our interpretation .",
    "we thank all members of the feps , irac , mips , and ssc teams for their efforts , as well as scott kenyon , nick siegler , and george rieke for valuable discussions , and an anonymous referee for helpful suggestions .",
    "this work was based on observations made with the spitzer space telescope , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under a contract with nasa .",
