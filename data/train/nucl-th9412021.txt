    "from their first introduction , quark models have been extensively used to study baryon spectra .",
    "some models have the quarks bound by a potential@xcite , others have them confined to a bag@xcite , and others have them bound as solitons@xcite .",
    "these models are fairly successful at fitting the masses and static properties of the baryon octet and decuplet and even some higher excited states . in most quark models ,",
    "the baryon masses are identified with the bound state energies of quarks within some potential well .",
    "this means that the pion - baryon interactions do not directly affect the values of the baryon masses , and that the baryons are stable since decay channels are not coupled in .",
    "phenomenologically , the masses of excited baryons are determined as the resonance energies in the phase - shift analysis of pion - nucleon scattering .",
    "these experimental masses naturally include mass shifts due to the pion - baryon interactions as well as widths due to the finite lifetimes of the states .",
    "accordingly , there are uncertainties in a direct comparison of the experimental masses to the bound - state energies of quarks bound in a potential well .",
    "chiral models , such as the cloudy bag models@xcite , contain pions in additions to quarks , and therefore also contain elementary pion - quark interactions .",
    "the calculation of masses with these models consequently include shifts due to the pion - baryon interactions .",
    "however , these models usually use perturbation theory to calculate the widths of the excited baryons , and this means that higher - order terms are ignored and that unitarity in the pion - nucleon channel is not ensured .",
    "ideally , one should determine the masses and widths of excited baryons by calculating the pion - baryon scattering matrix for a given model , and then finding the complex energies at which the scattering matrix has poles .",
    "this approach was used by thomas , thberge and miller@xcite for the n-@xmath4 system , and later extended to other partial waves@xcite and to other mesons@xcite .",
    "bag models suffer from several limitations .",
    "first , the use of an artificial bag to confine quarks leads to wave functions which have sharp discontinuities at the bag boundary .",
    "this leads to pion - baryon form factors ( and ultimately potentials ) which have unphysical oscillations and , presumably , limited ability to describe the scattering data .",
    "in addition , bag calculations treat the bare baryon masses and the bag radius as independent parameters even though we know this is not correct since for massless quarks the baryon masses are inversely proportional to the bag radius@xcite .    in the present work the chiral color dielectric model ( cdm )",
    "is employed to overcome some of the limitations of bag models .",
    "the cdm was first introduced phenomenologically to simulate the absolute confinement of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "a connection with the more fundamental theory was established by nielson and patkos@xcite who found that an effective color dielectric field does indeed arise naturally in lattice qcd after defining `` coarse grained '' effective field variables .",
    "the color dielectric field takes into account the long distance behavior of the qcd vacuum and produces a natural confinement of the quarks within baryons .",
    "more recently , krein et al.@xcite have solved the schwinger - dyson equation and shown how confinement and a pseudoscalar meson ( goldstone boson ) arise if chiral symmetry is dynamically broken .    in some recent cdm models ,",
    "chiral symmetry is restored via a nonlinear realization which introduces an elementary pion field as a goldstone boson .",
    "even though the mesons in these models are elementary , the baryon structure and the resulting relations of coupling constants are determined by the quark model@xcite . in application ,",
    "the cdm is similar to the cloudy bag model@xcite , yet somewhat more microscopic in its dynamic mechanism for quark confinement and its treatment of baryon recoil within a nontopological - soliton solution to the field equations .",
    "accordingly , when in the present paper we compare models which differ mainly in their treatment of quark binding , we hope to determine how important are improved ( or maybe just different ) quark dynamics when calculating two - body scattering , and how might the differences in the models manifest themselves .",
    "our calculation proceeds as follows .",
    "first we solve the quark and dielectric field equations of cdm in the mean field approximation ( mfa ) .",
    "we then quantize the classical dielectric field using the coherent state , and improve upon the mfa by including one - gluon exchange corrections perturbatively .",
    "we include the recoil of the baryon via the prescription of peierls - yoccoz projection@xcite .",
    "this , presumably , is a more important correction to scattering where large momentum transfers can occur than for static properties where the momentum transfers are small .",
    "once we have bare baryons constructed from quarks within a binding field , we expand the quark - pion interaction in powers of the pion field and calculate the transition matrix elements for baryon coupling with multiple pions . from these",
    "we identify the pion - nucleon potential , and then dress the vertices by substituting the potentials into the relativistic lippmann - schwinger equation@xcite : @xmath5 here the superscripts @xmath6 indicate the orbital angular momenta , the total angular momenta , and the total isospin , and the subscripts @xmath7 and @xmath8 indicate the @xmath0n or @xmath9 channels .",
    "we adjust the parameters of color dielectric model so that the poles of t matrix elements occur at the nucleon mass and at the @xmath4 s complex mass .",
    "we then use the model to predict low- and medium - energy @xmath0n scattering in @xmath2 and @xmath3 waves and the @xmath0nn and the @xmath0n@xmath4 coupling constants .",

    "arrows over quantities denote their isovector nature .",
    "the form ( [ l ] ) of the lagrangian becomes invariant under chiral transformations when the pion mass is set equal to zero .",
    "an important , yet phenomenological , part of the cdm lagrangian ( [ l ] ) is the dielectric self - interaction field @xmath23 .",

    "the gluon kinetic energy term @xmath30 vanishes and the quark effective mass @xmath31 becomes infinite .",
    "accordingly , we have the distinguishing characteristic of the cdm : the quark and gluon fields are confined within the baryon to the region of non - vanishing dielectric field @xmath14 .",
    "this contrasts with the bag model in which confinement is externally imposed by placing the quarks within an infinite square well .    as we see from the form of the lagrangian ( [ l ] ) with the dielectric self - interaction field ( [ u ] ) , the cdm has five parameters : the quark mass @xmath20 , the strong coupling constant @xmath32 ( or equivalently @xmath33 ) , the pion decay constant @xmath34 , the glueball ( or dielectric field ) mass @xmath35 , and the bag constant @xmath24 .",
    "although we do adjust some of these parameters to experimental data , their values are far from arbitrary .",

    "we next expand the lagrangian in powers of the inverse of @xmath34 , and retain terms up to order @xmath40 .",

    "you will notice that the one - pion vertex @xmath44 has a pseudovector coupling between the pion and the quark .",
    "the only surviving term for s - wave scattering is the two - pion contact interaction @xmath45 which comes from the covariant derivative on quarks ; this term reproduces the weinberg - tomozawa result which was originally derived from current algebra .    both the scalar dielectric field and the screened gluon fields exist in the lagrangian ( [ l2 ] ) .",
    "the simplest treatment of them is in a mean field approximation in which we ignore the screened gluon fields and the pion clouds ( one then needs one - gluon - exchange `` corrections '' to split the nucleon and delta masses ) .",

    "the energies of the poles of t are identified with renormalized masses for the physical states , the residues of the poles are identified with renormalized coupling constants , and the momentum distributions around the poles are related to the form factors .    when fitting data we always start off with a value for the glueball mass @xmath111 1 gev .",
    "the precise value does not appear to be important , but its general magnitude does set the energy scale in the equations of motion .",
    "we keep the shape parameter of the self - interaction of dielectric field fixed at @xmath112 since previous studies with the pseudoscalar version of the cdm@xcite have shown that the static properties of baryons are insensitive to @xmath8 for this size of @xmath36 .",
    "each time we obtain a solution of the field equations , we adjust the parameters @xmath36 , @xmath113 , and @xmath34 to best describe the @xmath0n phase shifts and the masses of the nucleon and delta . somewhat surprisingly , we found that we can reproduce the experimental masses for a large range of quark masses and bag constants just by adjusting the values for @xmath36 and @xmath113 .",
    "specifically , we find that we can vary the bag constant @xmath114 between 100 mev and 150 mev , and the quark mass between 40 mev and 120 mev . while 40 mev may appear small , the dielectric field also becomes small near the origin ( the `` one phase '' solution in which the wave function has no abrupt phase transition ) .",
    "consequently , the 40 mev quark has an effective mass inside of a nucleon of @xmath115 100 mev .",
    "the fitted parameters and deduced bare masses are given in table  [ tab0 ] .",

    ", a small value of @xmath113 compensates for our model of the dielectric field , @xmath120 , which otherwise would produce too large a color - magnetic energy .",
    "in addition , the pion - dressing in our model makes up for part of the @xmath121 and @xmath4 mass difference .",
    "this also makes the value of @xmath113 , which measures the strength of oge in our model , smaller than in those models without dressing .",
    "our fitted value @xmath122mev for the glueball mass is consistent with the values found in other models@xcite , and is in the region where glueball may occur@xcite .",
    "finally , we see in table  [ tab0 ] that the effect of renormalization on the nucleon and delta masses is to move the bare masses down by @xmath123mev .",
    "our calculation of scattering lengths indicates the need for some additional repulsion in our model , and we suspect that that repulsion would lead to less mass renormalization .      as indicated in ( [ h ] ) , we have deduced the cdm hamiltonians @xmath44 and @xmath45 from an expansion of the lagrangian in inverse powers of the pion s weak decay constant @xmath34 , or equivalently , as a series expansion in the @xmath0nn coupling constant @xmath124 .",
    "this equivalence follows from the goldberger - trieman relation@xcite : @xmath125 while the relation ( [ gt ] ) relates the bare coupling constants , our study also produces renormalized coupling constants .",

    "it is particularly interesting to compare these form factors with those calculated in other approaches since the form factors are related to the cdm quark wave functions ( which should be fairly realistic ) , and since they are affected by the renormalization process .",
    "while we have already indicated that fits to the data do not determine a unique set of parameters , the different parameter sets are correlated . in the upper part of figure  [ fvsf ]",
    "we show the relation between the strong coupling constant @xmath124 deduced from our fits and the bare , weak decay constant @xmath34 ( note the false origin ) .",
    "the dashed curve relates the bare values of @xmath124 as determined from the goldberger - trieman relation ( [ gt ] ) , or equivalently , from the potential directly .",

    "although not shown in the figure , we have also calculated @xmath128 from the residue of the @xmath4 pole and find : @xmath133 this ratio is quite close to the experimental value of @xmath134 , closer in fact than the su(6 ) prediction@xcite of @xmath135 .",
    "this clearly shows the importance of renormalization .    in the lower part of figure  [ fig.g(k ) ]",
    "we show the @xmath0nn form factors deduced from the behavior of the t matrix near the nucleon pole .",
    "the two different curves correspond to two different values of the pion decay constant @xmath34 .",

    "if we replace our form factor with the monopole form factor defined above and use it in an actual t - matrix calculation , we would get poor agreement with the experimental phase shifts .",
    "thus , in contrast to the meson exchange models , pion - nucleon scattering seems to require soft form factors like the ones obtained in our model .",
    "a similar conclusion has also been reached recently by others@xcite .      in figure  [ fig.del ]",

    "comparison of the born results to experiment and to our full calculation indicates that renormalization is large , and that some additional repulsion is needed .",

    "the cdm is used to derive effective potentials containing terms up to second order in the @xmath0nn coupling , and these potentials are used as input to relativistic , coupled - channel lippmann - schwinger equations .",
    "the model reproduces the physical nucleon and delta masses , and then predicts the @xmath0nn and @xmath0n@xmath4 coupling constants and form factors , and low - energy @xmath0n scattering .",
    "we find much success for such a simple model .",
    "specifically , we can simultaneously obtain the correct renormalized masses for the nucleon and delta , the correct delta width , the @xmath0nn coupling constant to within 5% of it experimental value , the ratio of the renormalized @xmath0n@xmath4 to @xmath0nn coupling constants which is better than the su(6 ) value , excellent agreement with the @xmath103 phase shifts from threshold through the delta resonance energy , good agreement with the @xmath143 and @xmath142 scattering volumes , and good agreement with the energy dependence of the @xmath142 phase shift for the first 300 mev of kinetic energy .",
    "better agreement with the s - wave and small p - wave phases requires additional repulsion in the model , possibly obtained by one - loop corrections . the model",
    "could also be improved by obtaining solutions to the field equations beyond those of the mean field approximation and by the inclusion of additional dielectric fields@xcite .",
    "we give here the complete form factors for the ( @xmath0n,@xmath1 ) system .",
    "since the @xmath4 differs from the @xmath121 only in spin - isospin orientations , they have the same space wave function and thus the same form factors .",
    "the pseudovector vertex functions with the momentum projected states evaluated in the breit frame are : @xmath151 where @xmath152 is a momentum - dependent normalization constant for a projected baryon state , and @xmath153 is a localized baryon state .",
