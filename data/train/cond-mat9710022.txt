    "in the last few years quite a few papers were published in which computer simulations were used to study the time dependence of the _ translational _ degrees of freedom ( tdof ) in supercooled liquids . on the other hand ,",
    "the _ orientational _ degrees of freedom ( odof ) were so far investigated in much less detail since the simulation and data analysis of systems in which the particles are molecules are quite a bit more involved than the ones in which the particles have no structure . however , since most real materials are of molecular nature and since experimental methods such as light scattering or dielectric measurements probe also the odof , it is important to understand how the dynamics of the tdof and the odof are related to each other . only by understanding this relationship it will be possible to make a correct interpretation of the experimental measurements and to gain insight into the nature of the glass transition , i.e. the dramatic slowing down of the relaxation dynamics of supercooled liquids upon approaching the glass transition temperature",
    ". a more thorough discussion of these connections can be found , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite , were we also review some of the other work in this field .",
    "very recently we have carried out a molecular dynamics computer simulation of a simple molecular system in order to make a detailed comparison between the dynamics of the tdof and the odof  @xcite .",
    "each molecule in this system is dumb - bell shaped and consists of two lennard - jones particles that are separated by a fixed distance @xmath23 .",
    "more details on the system and the simulation can be found in ref .",

    "we studied the time and temperature dependence of the orientational correlation functions    @xmath24    and the self part @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 is the unit vector pointing along the molecular symmetry axis of molecule @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the @xmath3-th legendre polynomial .",
    "the relevance of these type of correlation functions is given by the fact that they can be measured in experiments .",
    "the main results of that paper were that the temperature dependence of the relaxation times of @xmath29 , @xmath30 and the diffusion constant @xmath31 were given by a power law with the same critical temperature @xmath10 but with critical exponents that depend on the observable .",
    "in addition we showed that the so - called time temperature superposition principle works well for @xmath30 , if @xmath32 .",
    "thus we concluded that many of the predictions of mode - coupling theory ( mct )  @xcite hold for these correlation functions , although certain discrepancies are present .    in the preceding paper , subsequently called kksi , we have investigated the time and temperature dependence of the _ translational _ degrees of freedom by studying quantities like the van hove correlation function @xmath33 and the intermediate scattering function @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion of that paper was that mct is able to give also a good description for the time and temperature dependence of these correlation functions .",
    "as we will demonstrate below , the intermediate scattering function @xmath34 and the orientational correlation functions @xmath35 are just a special case of a more general type of correlation function , which involves the translational as well as the orientational degrees of freedom at finite wave - vector @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath37 . the goal of the _ present _ paper is therefore to investigate the time and temperature dependence of these more general correlation functions , since it is these correlators which are needed for a more detailed description of the dynamics of a molecular system . in addition",
    "these correlation functions can also be calculated directly within the framework of mct ( although such a calculation might be in practice quite involved ) thus allowing to perform a more stringent test of whether mct is able to give a correct description of the dynamics of the system investigated .",

    "we will refer to the @xmath27th equation of that paper by ( i-@xmath27 ) .",
    "this section is subdivided into two parts .",
    "the first part contains the results for the static correlators @xmath71 , and the second one presents the dynamical correlators @xmath70 and @xmath72 . in the following",
    "we restrict the values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 to 0 , 1 and 2 .",
    "the static correlators are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] -  [ fig4 ] for the lowest investigated temperature @xmath73 .",
    "first of all , it becomes obvious from these figures that @xmath74 is @xmath5-independent and diagonal in @xmath3 and @xmath4 , as it should be due to isotropy .",
    "a comparison of the various diagonal correlators in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] with each other shows , that the correlators @xmath75 for @xmath14 and 2 possess a significant @xmath1-dependence similar to that of @xmath76 , in contrast to those for @xmath77 . the same behavior was found for a system of dipolar hard spheres  @xcite , although for that system the most prominent peak occurs for @xmath78 at @xmath79 . in contrast to @xmath80 and @xmath81 , the correlator @xmath82 has a rather broad maximum at @xmath79 with a height which is comparable to that at @xmath83 , the location of the main peak in @xmath84 . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we present the non - diagonal correlators @xmath71 with @xmath85 .",
    "first of all one recognizes that @xmath86 is much larger than @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "this can easily be understood .",
    "if the molecules had `` head - tail''-symmetry , then it can be shown that @xmath89 , for @xmath90 such that @xmath91 is odd . since for our molecules",
    "this symmetry is only slightly broken , we expect @xmath71 to be much smaller for @xmath91 odd than for @xmath91 even .",
    "the second point one recognizes from this figure is that the non - diagonal correlators @xmath71 can have the same magnitude than the diagonal ones .",
    "hence , there is no reason why the former should be neglected in analytical calculations .",
    "for example , since the solutions of the mct - equations for the time - dependent correlators @xmath70 are determined by the static correlators @xmath71 , it might not be a good approximation to consider @xmath6 , only .",
    "we have investigated both , the self correlators for @xmath92 and the collective correlators for @xmath93 and 2 .",
    "let us start with the self part @xmath8",
    ". often it is assumed ( see e.g. @xcite ) that the @xmath1- and @xmath21-dependence ( where @xmath6 ) factorizes , i.e. : @xmath94 with @xmath25 the self part of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and @xmath95 , the self part of eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) .",

    "[ fig6 ] ( @xmath14 ) and fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ( @xmath98 ) for three different @xmath1-values and @xmath99 .",
    "although the factorization becomes worse with increasing @xmath1 , it is still a reasonable approximation , even for @xmath100 .",
    "furthermore , the quality of the factorization is better in the @xmath101-relaxation than in the @xmath102-relaxation regime ( at least for @xmath98 ) , and it also becomes better with increasing temperature .",
    "this approximate factorization does not necessarily mean that the coupling between the tdof and odof is very weak .",
    "the comparison of @xmath25 with @xmath103 in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] reveals the reason why @xmath8 can be approximately factorized .",
    "for instance , @xmath104 has decayed to 0.1 for @xmath105 , whereas at this time the value of @xmath106 is still around 0.85 , i.e. the odof relax much faster than the tdof .",
    "this is consistent with our observation that in the time span of the orientational correlation time , as deduced from @xmath104 at the lowest temperature , the average center of mass positions change only a fraction ( about 30 @xmath107 ) of the mean distance between the molecular centers .",
    "we stress that this is different to the md - simulation of supercooled water .",
    "there , @xmath103 and @xmath35 relax on approximately the same time scale @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the test of the various mct - predictions ( see kksi ) .",
    "we find  @xcite that @xmath108 do not obey the second scaling law , i.e. the time - temperature superposition principle .",
    "this observation has already been made for the case @xmath79",
    "@xcite , which shows that this type of correlation function does not follow the predictions of mct .",
    "this situation is different for the correlation function @xmath8 with @xmath109 for which the second scaling law holds reasonably well .",
    "the critical exponents ( which are practically @xmath1-independent ) for the divergence of the relaxation time , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , is 1.8 and 2.45 , respectively , where the latter value is fairly close to the one found for the tdof , @xmath103 , which was 2.56  @xcite .",
    "the exceptional role for the correlators with @xmath14 is due to the existence of @xmath112-jumps of the molecular axis  @xcite , since the legendre polynomial @xmath113 is sensitive on reorientations by @xmath112 .",
    "the same is true for all @xmath114 with @xmath3 odd .",
    "but the weight of @xmath114 for @xmath115 and @xmath116 decreases with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "since the second scaling law holds for @xmath117 , we can restrict ourselves in the following to the analysis of the correlation functions at the _",

    "more details on this analysis can be found in section  [ sec4 ] of the preceding paper @xcite . for @xmath12 ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) the critical correlator fits the data very well over about two decades in time .",
    "this range , however , becomes smaller with increasing @xmath3 , which may indicate that corrections to the asymptotic law become more important for large @xmath3 . if one uses @xmath13 and @xmath121 ( cf .",
    "( i-4 ) ) as free fit parameters , the resulting fits follow the data longer by additional one to two orders of magnitude in time .",
    "( we note that even @xmath104 can be fitted reasonably well with @xmath11 . since we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for this correlation function the first scaling law does not hold , one might argue that it does not make sense to analyze @xmath122 in the way proposed by mct .",
    "however , we find that the violation of the second scaling law is only weak and therefore it is not unreasonable to make such an analysis . )",
    "the so obtained values for @xmath13 increase towards one with increasing @xmath3 and reach , e.g. , 0.97 for @xmath123 .",
    "we also mention that we do not observe a critical law , eq .",

    "2 of @xcite is exactly what we have found in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] for our system .",
    "the reader should also note that even the relative weight between the intensity of @xmath102- and microscopic peaks has the same qualitative behavior in both cases , i.e. it is significantly larger for @xmath14 than for @xmath140 and @xmath98 .",
    "a similar result has been recently found from a md - simulation of ckn , where the orientational dynamics ( self part ) of the no@xmath194 ion was studied for @xmath14 and @xmath98  @xcite . in that paper , and also for the collective dynamics of dipolar hard spheres  @xcite , it has been concluded that the different weights of the @xmath102 and microscopic peaks relate to the different numerical values for the critical nonergodicity parameters . for @xmath79",
    "is has been argued that @xmath195 ( due to @xmath79 , no @xmath5-dependence exists )  @xcite . since @xmath196 is the @xmath102-relaxation strength of the corresponding susceptibility and @xmath197 fulfills a sum rule ( on a logarithmic frequency scale ) , it becomes obvious that the ratio between the @xmath102-relaxation strength and the area under the microscopic peak is larger for @xmath14 than for @xmath98 .",
    "whether this agreement between the susceptibilities of glycerol and that for our diatomic molecular liquid is merely accidental or not , is , however , not obvious .",
    "one has to keep in mind , ( i ) that dielectric spectroscopy and light scattering measures the collective dynamics and not their self part and ( ii ) glycerol has a permanent dipolar moment , in contrast to our diatomic molecules .",
    "how far the dipolar interaction would change our md - results is not clear .",
    "in addition , we believe that the special role of @xmath14 relates to the @xmath198-jumps of the molecules @xcite . whether these jumps exist for glycerol also and whether they really cause a shift of the minimum is uncertain .",
    "to summarize , we may say that the results obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite and in the present paper are consistent with mct .",
    "there is strong evidence for a single transition temperature , as it is predicted from molecular mct @xcite and for the validity of the two scaling laws , with exception of the correlators with @xmath14 .",
    "concerning the second scaling regime we have found that the @xmath159-exponent is not universal in agreement with earlier work on binary liquids @xcite , but at variance with the md - simulation for water @xcite .",
    "it will be a challenge to clarify the discrepancy for the @xmath159-values .",
    "the critical law , which is part of the first scaling regime could not be observed , due to a strong interference with the microscopic dynamics .",
