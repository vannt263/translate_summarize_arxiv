    "there are many properties in pattern forming reaction  diffusion systems that do not depend on the geometry of the system ( for instance turing wavelengths , frequencies of oscillation , shapes and velocities of waves or fronts . ) @xcite . due to this fact , most studies on pattern formation have not paid too much attention to features such as the shapes and sizes of the reactors or the boundary conditions , working mainly with infinite systems or periodic boundary conditions . however , it is well known that boundaries and boundary conditions can play a relevant role in determining the behaviour of this kind of systems . for instance , in reference @xcite the importance of geometrical characteristics is quiet remarkable .",
    "also , recent theoretical papers have shown that the domain shape may have an important effect in the propagation of waves in excitable media @xcite , and that the consideration of non trivial boundary conditions @xcite in some reaction diffusion  systems leads to qualitatively different dynamic behaviour from the one obtained in infinite media .    here",
    "we analyze problems where the boundary conditions ( bc s ) , as well as the size of the system , are relevant parameters determining the kind of complex dynamics arising .",
    "we study an activator ",
    "inhibitor model in the oscillatory regime considering different geometries with partially absorptive bc s .",
    "for a density field @xmath0 of a given reactant this condition is written as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the diffusion constant , the subscript @xmath3 indicates evaluation at the boundary , @xmath4 is the unit vector normal to the boundary in the outer direction , and @xmath5 is the absorption or albedo parameter .",
    "this relation expresses the fact that there is an outgoing flux of reactants through the boundary which is proportional to the density .",
    "the limit @xmath6 corresponds to no flux or neumann bc s , which means a perfectly reflecting ( non absorbing ) boundary , whereas clearly , an increasing value of @xmath7 corresponds to an increasing absorption at the boundary , and a reduced reflectivity .",
    "we consider the reaction  diffusion model given by the equations @xmath8 where the non linear function @xmath9 characterizes the autocatalytical properties of the activator @xmath10 .",
    "the model shares the general features of more realistic ones describing chemical systems such as the belousov zabotinskii or cima reactions @xcite . for @xmath11 ,",
    "it was used in the analysis of the propagation of fronts in bistable systems @xcite and also in the study of pattern formation in inhomogeneous media @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath12 is here set equal to @xmath13 $ ] . with this election @xmath14",
    "represents a translation of the related spatially independent system ( i.e. eqs .",
    "( [ sys ] ) without diffusion terms ) in the ( @xmath15)-plane along the line @xmath16 . for @xmath17",
    "the equations describe a bistable medium , while for @xmath18 they describe an oscillatory one . here",
    ", we consider @xmath19 . in order to work with positive values of the densities @xmath10 and @xmath20 , we set @xmath21 .",
    "this last fact is desirable taking into account the kind of bc s we will work with , however , it is not strictly necessary , as we have found the same kind of results ( in all the problems here discussed ) using @xmath22 .    for the chosen values of parameters , the homogeneous system associated to eqs .",
    "( [ sys ] ) has a limit cycle solution of period @xmath23 . as initial conditions for our extended system we consider homogeneous states belonging to this limit cycle .",
    "this ( natural ) choice is taken in order to focus our attention on the effects caused by the boundary conditions",
    ". the consideration of inhomogeneous initial states would produce additional pattern forming phenomena that would interact with those coming from the boundary conditions .",
    "an important characteristic of the extended system is that , for @xmath24 , a turing instability @xcite of wavelength @xmath25 coexists ( and competes ) with the hopf instability @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that a wide spectrum of possibilities concerning pattern dynamics arises when different boundary conditions are considered in an oscillatory medium .",
    "we would like to attract the interest of experimentalists to study these situations .",
    "the experimental observation of the phenomena here predicted might be realized by adequately designing chemical systems sharing the properties of our models . also , the partially absorptive conditions may appear in real systems as defects at the boundaries , such as , small separations between the gel and the wall of the reactor containing the solution with uncontrolled concentration of reactants .",
    "another experimental possibility is to work with electrical systems @xcite .",
    "all numerical calculations were done as follows .",
    "firstly , the different systems of partial differential equations have been approximated by systems of coupled ordinary differential equations , obtained by finite difference schemes .",
    "secondly the resulting equations have been solved by a runge  kutta 2 method .",
    "different space and time discretization schemes were employed in order to check the results .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section ii we study a unidimensional system with neumann boundary conditions at one border and partially absorptive at the other . in section iii",
    "we study two different bidimensional systems corresponding to a circular reactor with partially absorptive boundary conditions and a long rectangular system with different boundary conditions on its walls .",
    "the last section is devoted to discussing the results and drawing some conclusions .",
    "we now consider eqs.([sys ] ) in the one dimensional domain @xmath26 , with neumann bc s at @xmath27 and partially absorptive bc s at @xmath28 : @xmath29 as initial conditions we consider homogeneous states belonging to the limit cycle of the associated non extended system ( eqs .",
    "( [ sys ] ) without diffusion ) .",
    "we analyze the dynamics for different values of @xmath30,@xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    at short times , near @xmath27 , where there are neumann bc s , the system evolves very close to the natural homogeneous limit cycle of the medium ; whereas , near @xmath28 , the motion is perturbed by the albedo bc s which cause the local oscillations to be slower and of smaller amplitude .",
    "this effect increases with the absorption parameter .",
    "hence , the dynamics of the system begins to be inhomogeneous and the perturbation is transmitted from @xmath28 to the rest of the system , which asymptotically reaches different dynamical regimes depending on the parameters .",
    "the resulting regime is independent of the initial condition ( when taken on the limit cycle as mentioned above ) except maybe in some specific parameter regions , as we will discuss later .    for very high absorption",
    ", the oscillations near @xmath28 are inhibited . as a consequence of this , for small enough systems ( typically @xmath34 , but depending on @xmath31 and @xmath7 s ) , the oscillations are found to be stopped in the whole system and stationary patterns are generated .",
    "this is because the stationary tendency of the zone near @xmath28 affects the whole system .",
    "the effect is increased when @xmath31 grows , since the coupling of the rest of the system to the indicated zone becomes stronger .",
    "( for a higher value of @xmath31 , a stationary pattern may appear for lower values of the absorption parameter or in a larger system . )    in general , when this stationary regime does not occur , the oscillations are not inhibited .",
    "the system asymptotically reaches periodic , quasiperiodic , or chaotic inhomogeneous regimes .",
    "however , for large enough @xmath31 ( typically @xmath35 ) , the system evolves toward a turing pattern , that is also stationary , but of a completely different origin @xcite than the stationary patterns described above .",
    "turing patterns are generated by means of freezing fronts @xcite which travel from @xmath28 ( the slower oscillating zone ) to the rest of the system .",
    "as they advance , they inhibit the temporal oscillations and leave behind the characteristic spatially  periodic structures .",
    "the process of formation of a turing pattern is shown in fig.1 .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the phase diagram indicating the asymptotic behaviour of a system of length @xmath36 with @xmath37 as function of @xmath31 and @xmath7 .",
    "the different regions correspond to turing patterns ( tp ) , inhomogeneous periodic oscillations ( po ) , inhomogeneous quasiperiodic oscillations ( qp ) and spatiotemporal chaos ( ch ) .    in the periodic region ( po )",
    ", the asymptotic behaviours correspond to regimes of periodic traveling waves from @xmath28 ( albedo bc ) to @xmath27 ( neumann bc ) .",
    "the global period of the motion results always a little bit larger than @xmath38 .",
    "this is because of the early slowdown of the oscillations occurring near @xmath28 , that is later transmitted to the whole system . in fig .",
    "3 we show a spatiotemporal plot of the @xmath10field corresponding to a time window of a typical asymptotic regime in the po region .    to distinguish between po , qp , and ch regimes we consider the succession @xmath39 of times at which @xmath40 reaches a local maximum as function of @xmath41 , i.e. the times when @xmath42 occur simultaneously",
    ". then we define a new succession @xmath43 .",
    "the study of the behaviour of @xmath44 provides a useful and simple way to determine the character of the dynamics ( periodic , quasiperiodic or chaotic ) , as was already observed when dealing with inhomogeneous systems @xcite . in the case of periodic motion",
    "the value of @xmath45 converges to a constant @xmath46 which coincides with the period of the global motion . in the case of quasiperiodic motion",
    "the @xmath47 asymptotically show periodic or quasiperiodic behaviour . in the chaotic region",
    "the @xmath47 exhibit highly disordered behaviour . instead of considering the succession @xmath44",
    ", we work with the values of @xmath45 plotted as a function of @xmath48 . hence we define a function of time @xmath49 ( strictly defined only for the discrete values @xmath50 ) . in fig .",
    "4 we show the typical plots of the @xmath51 for the po , qp and ch regimes . in fig .",
    "the early time behaviour can be observed , in which the system at @xmath27 is performing the natural limit cycle oscillation of the medium , until the perturbation coming from @xmath28 arrives slowing sown the motion .",
    "it is worth here mentioning that we have not observed marginal profiles of @xmath51 where the determination of the kind of dynamics was not clear .",
    "however , in the transition zones between phases , the transients are long and it is necessary to observe the evolution for a very long time .",
    "another remarkable fact is that disordered behaviour such as that appearing in fig . 4.c .",
    "-here called chaotic- are chaotic in the sense of showing high sensitivity to initial conditions .",
    "we have verified this fact in a large number of cases by studying the evolution of the distance between solutions with different ( but close ) initial conditions , in the same way as it was done in @xcite .    in the asymptotic regimes of the qp and ch regions , it is not only waves traveling from @xmath28 to @xmath27 that appear .",
    "there are intervals during which waves travel in the opposite sense , and also , from time to time , a center emitting waves in both directions may appear in any part of the system ( specially in the ch regime ) .",
    "these effects are observed as defects and dislocations in the spatiotemporal plots of the @xmath10fields . in the qp region ,",
    "the defects appear periodically or quasiperiodically in time , while in the ch region they appear in a random way . in fig .",
    "5 we show a spatiotemporal plot corresponding to a chaotic regime , together with the plot of @xmath51 for the same time window . there , it can be observed that the arising of defects is related to the occurrence of maxima in @xmath51 , which indicates delays in the oscillations at @xmath27 .    in a small region of the transition zone between the po and tp regions , which appears shadowed in the diagram of fig",
    "2 , the behaviour of the system is complicated . in general",
    ", a long chaotic transient appears that , later , eventually converges to turing patterns , periodic or quasiperiodic behaviour . in this zone ,",
    "the asymptotic behaviour is also possibly dependent on the initial condition -even when homogeneous and belonging to the indicated limit cycle .",
    "we have observed also turing patterns that are generated by freezing fronts coming from @xmath27 ( the neumann bc ) instead of from @xmath28 ( the albedo bc ) .",
    "one possible explanation for such peculiarities is that , in this zone of the diagram , the turing instability is well established , but the albedo bc s introduce only a very small perturbation ( because of the small values of @xmath7s ) that it is not always strong enough to excite the unstable spatial mode .    in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "2 we have indicated with dotted and dashed lines the zones where the transition between periodic and nonperiodic regimes respectively occur for a system with ( @xmath52 ) and ( @xmath53 ) . it can be seen that for ( @xmath52 ) the transition occurs for similar or even lower values of @xmath7 than in the case @xmath54 but , for ( @xmath53 ) , much larger values of @xmath7 are needed in order to observe nonperiodic regimes .",
    "this indicates that the system is more sensitive to changes ( or imperfections ) in the boundary conditions of the @xmath20field than of the @xmath10field .    in the next section",
    "we analyze the dynamics of eqs .",
    "( [ sys ] ) with partially absorptive bc s in two different bidimensional geometries .",
    "firstly we consider the activator inhibitor model of eqs.([sys ] ) in a circular system of radius @xmath55 with albedo bc for both fields @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the radial coordinate .",
    "we impose homogeneous initial conditions as in the previous section and study numerically the radial equations corresponding to ( [ sys ] ) : @xmath58 with @xmath59 , @xmath12 , @xmath60 and @xmath14 as before . analyzing the spatiotemporal plots @xmath61 of the solutions and the @xmath45s ( now defined at @xmath62 ) , we have observed the same kinds of behaviour ( periodic , quasiperiodic chaotic and turing ) as in the unidimensional system of the last section . in fig .",
    "6 we show the phase diagram for two different values of the radius of the system @xmath55 .    in the first case , for @xmath63 , there is no ch phase because the system is not large enough to allow the required disorder on the dynamics of the oscillating phase in the different parts of the system to be produced .",
    "however , some chaotic isolated points have been observed in the shadowed zone in the transition to the tp region , where the properties of the dynamics are similar to those explained for the one  dimensional problem .",
    "for @xmath64 we have the same phases as in the unidimensional problem . here",
    ", the asymptotic regimes correspond to target patterns , that are stationary in the tp region , and of waves traveling from @xmath65 to @xmath62 in the po region , and traveling in both directions in the qp and ch regions .    in the ch region ,",
    "the radial symmetry is expected to be broken by small angular perturbations in real systems .    in both diagrams",
    "we show the transition lines from periodic to nonperiodic regimes for the cases ( @xmath53 ) and ( @xmath52 ) . the observed shift of these lines relative respect to that for @xmath54 are similar to those in the one dimensional problem .",
    "the conclusion that the system is more sensitive to boundary conditions on the @xmath20field remains valid in bidimensional systems .",
    "now we consider eqs.([sys ] ) in the same parameter region as before , in a long rectangular domain ( @xmath66 ) with @xmath67 with different boundary conditions on its sides .",
    "we fix albedo bc at @xmath27 with @xmath68 ( which means a strong absorption or very small reflectivity ) and neumann bc at @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "if we now fix neumann bc also at the @xmath71 sides , we will have ( for homogeneous initial conditions ) an effective one  dimensional system equivalent to the one analyzed in section ii . instead",
    ", here we consider another albedo bc at @xmath71 with a different value of @xmath72 . in this case",
    "the patterns will not have translational symmetry in the @xmath73direction .",
    "we fix @xmath74 and study numerically the solutions for different values of @xmath7 and @xmath75 . the situation to analyze",
    "is sketched in fig .",
    ".    the one dimensional problem with @xmath76 at one end , and @xmath6 at the other is chaotic for @xmath77 .",
    "now , in the bidimensional system considered , it is expected that when increasing the albedo parameter on the @xmath71 sides from zero , the dynamics will begin to differ from the one of the one  dimensional system .",
    "in particular , if @xmath75 is small and @xmath7 large , we expect that the system will become stationary because of the stationary tendency introduced by this new boundary condition that will constrain the oscillations from the sides .",
    "this is in fact what simulations have shown .",
    "there are also intermediate values of @xmath7 and @xmath75 where the stationary tendency of the sides is not enough to completely inhibit the oscillations , but it is enough to change their characteristics from chaotic to quasiperiodic or periodic .    in fig .",
    "8 we show a diagram of the @xmath78plane indicating the stationary and non  stationary regions as well as some points where periodic , quasiperiodic and chaotic dynamics have been observed .",
    "it is posible to use a simple theoretical scheme in order to explain qualitatively the transition of the system from non stationary regimes to stationary ones when @xmath7 is increased or @xmath75 decreased .",
    "such a scheme is based on a concept originated within the framework of nuclear reactor physics that simplifies noticeably the analysis of the so called criticality problems or neutron density distributions , in many situations of interest .",
    "this is the concept of _ geometrical buckling_. it helped to reduce the dimensionality of the problem , by assuming that directions transverse to the more relevant one can be essentially described by the fundamental mode .",
    "such an assumption allows to include the effect of those extra dimensions through ( lateral ) `` sink '' contributions ( that is taking into account the lateral leak ) in a ( typically one  dimensional ) diffusion equation for the neutron density on the relevant direction @xcite .",
    "for instance , using this approximation it is possible to estimate the critical mass or radius of a nuclear system .",
    "clearly , such an approximation gives reliable results due to the linearity of the neutron diffusion equation ( at least over time scales shorter than those at which the transport coefficients cross section , diffusion constants change ) .",
    "our system of equations is clearly nonlinear , hence such an approach could in principle not be applied .",
    "however , we qualitatively introduce such an idea forcing our equations to reduce their dimensionality and including associated sink or leak terms .    for the system in eq.([sys ] ) in the rectangular geometry with @xmath67 , and albedo conditions at @xmath71 given by @xmath79 we will assume that the solution can be written as @xmath80 hence , we are approximating the profiles of the distributions of @xmath10 and @xmath20 in the @xmath73 coordinate as being independent of @xmath81 and @xmath41 except for a global factor .",
    "the cosine functions give a more or less desirable form for the densities , having a maxima at @xmath82 .",
    "clearly , the ( @xmath6)case corresponds to @xmath83 with solutions independent of @xmath73 .",
    "we may expect that our approximation will give qualitatively better results for small @xmath7 . from eq .",
    "( [ albfr ] ) we find the following relation that determines @xmath84 and @xmath85 as function of @xmath86 and @xmath31 : @xmath87 and from eq.([sys ] ) we obtain @xmath88 now , since @xmath67 , we might think that , whether the dynamics is stationary or not will depend only on @xmath7 and @xmath75 and not on what happens on the @xmath81 coordinate@xcite , and we may consider the system as independent of @xmath81 .",
    "we then obtain the following equations for a space independent activator  inhibitor system : @xmath89 this system , for the chosen values of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath12 , is oscillatory for null or small values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , but there exist critical values of these quantities ( which depend on @xmath75 , @xmath31 and @xmath7 through eqs.([tan ] ) ) beyond which the system begins to be monostable , i.e. asymptotically stationary .",
    "we associate this stationarity to that of our extended system . in fig .",
    "8 we have plotted with a dotted line the limit from stationary to non stationary regimes predicted in this way . although the results do not agree quantitatively with those coming from simulations in the extended bidimensional system ( solid line ) , the occurrence of the phenomenon is clearly well predicted qualitativelly .",
    "we have analyzed the influence of partially absorptive boundary conditions in a typical reaction diffusion  model of an oscillatory active medium with different geometries . we have observed that the homogeneous periodic behaviour expected for the case of neumann boundary conditions , when homogeneous initial condition are considered , is completely altered when the absorption parameter is increased from zero . for small absorption",
    ", the behaviour continues being periodic although the homogeneity is lost and traveling waves are observed . for higher absorption ( with precise values of @xmath7 s depending on the diffusion constants ) , the periodicity is broken and quasiperiodic inhomogeneous oscillation and spatiotemporal chaos arise .",
    "the kind of phenomena described here is expected to appear in real systems sharing the properties of the model .",
    "the predictions made for the three systems analyzed ( one  dimensional , circular and band  shaped ) illustrates what can be expected in more complicated situations .",
    "for example , let us consider the same dynamics given by eqs .",
    "( [ sys ] ) with homogeneous initial conditions , but now in a square reactor with neumann bc s everywhere except in a sector where albedo bc s are imposed . in fig .",
    "9 we show the contour plots of the @xmath10fields for this system at several times taken in the asymptotic regime , assuming standard values of the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath7 .",
    "the spatiotemporal complexity arising is apparent .    when analyzing the transition lines from periodic to nonperiodic regimes for the cases ( @xmath53 ) and ( @xmath90 ) we have observed shifts of these lines relative to the case @xmath54 that are similar in both the one dimensional and the circular cases .",
    "these results imply that the system is more sensitive to boundary conditions on the @xmath20field than on the @xmath10field .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , in a real experiment on oscillatory media , the waves emerging from the boundaries with imperfect reflectivity will interact with other patterns that may be spontaneously generated from fluctuations in the distribution of reactants in any part of the system . in this paper",
    "we have analyzed simpler situations that allowed us to isolate clearly the effects of the boundaries .",
    "the results obtained constitute a starting point for the study of more realistic situations .",
    "the analysis of the dynamics of the @xmath81 coordinate would determine , in case the motion is not stationary , whether it is periodic , quasiperiodic , or chaotic ; but this is an aspect in which we are not interested here ."
