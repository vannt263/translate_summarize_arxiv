    "it is widely accepted that the potential energy in a few - nucleon system consists of a sum of the pairwise @xmath6 interaction and a term including a pure three - nucleon interaction .",
    "this last term is not very well known and , in general , its strength is fixed so as to reproduce the experimental @xmath9 binding energy . with the recent advances in the solution of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 continuum ,",
    "the possibility of using scattering data to improve our knowledge of the three - nucleon interaction is at present feasible . because of this , a correct treatment of the complete electromagnetic interaction in the description of few - nucleon reactions is required . in fact , coulomb effects and three - nucleon force effects are very often of the same size . moreover , the magnetic moment ( mm ) interaction between two - nucleons can give sizable contributions to some polarization observables .    in the present contribution @xmath0 scattering",
    "is studied using the argonne @xmath1 ( av18 ) nn potential  @xcite plus the urbana ix ( ur ) three - nucleon potential  @xcite and electromagnetic terms as the coulomb and magnetic moment interactions .",

    "a comparison to recent high - quality measurements is performed .",
    "following the notation used in the determination of the av18 potential , all modern @xmath6 potentials can be put in the general form    @xmath10    the short range part @xmath11 of these interactions includes a certain number of parameters ( around 40 ) , which are determined by a fitting procedure to the @xmath6 scattering data and the deuteron binding energy ( be ) , whereas the long range part is represented by the one - pion - exchange potential @xmath12 and the electromagnetic potential @xmath13 .",
    "the av18 potential includes the same @xmath13 used in the nijmegen partial - wave analysis except for short - range terms and finite size corrections .",
    "the @xmath14 consists of the one- and two - photon coulomb terms plus the darwin - foldy term , vacuum polarization and mm interactions .",

    ". we can observe a very small influence of the mm interaction in the peak of @xmath72 with the tendency of slightly flattening the observable .",

    "it is interesting to notice the forward - angle dip structure which already appears in @xmath21 scattering  @xcite . only after summing the series up to @xmath69 it is possible to reproduce this particular behavior which is a consequence of the term proportional to @xmath77 .",

    "the dashed line corresponds to the same calculation as before but the @xmath38-matrix elements has been calculated using the av18+mm potential .",
    "the dashed - dotted line corresponds to the complete calculation including the @xmath41 amplitude .",
    "we see that the major effect of the mm interaction is obtained around the peak and is appreciable at both energies .",
    "there is also an improvement in the description of the observable at forward angles .",
    "the observed modifications are due to the interference between the coulomb and the nuclear plus the mm interaction and not due to high order terms as in the @xmath47 case .",
    "in fact high order terms are dominated by the coulomb interaction and the mm interaction gives a very small contribution . as for @xmath47 scattering ,",

    "experimental data are not always conclusive since experiments with neutrons have larger uncertainties than those performed with protons . several times the description of @xmath2 scattering has been performed using @xmath47 calculations , in particular at high energies  @xcite . to make clear the importance of coulomb effects as the energy of the collision increases , in figs.3,4 we show a comparison of @xmath47 and @xmath2 calculations at @xmath90 mev . in fig.3",

    "three curves are displayed corresponding to @xmath2 av18 ( solid line ) , @xmath47 av18 ( dashed line ) and @xmath2 av18+ur ( dotted line ) and compared to experimental data . in fig.4 the same calculations are shown for @xmath87 and the three tensor analyzing powers .",
    "we can observe appreciable coulomb effects in @xmath5 whereas three - nucleon interaction effects can be observed in the minimum of the differential cross section and in @xmath5 and @xmath91 as well .     at @xmath90 mev . for explanation of the curves",
    "experimental data are from ref .",
    "@xcite , width=529 ]    the mm interaction has a different effect in @xmath47 or @xmath2 vector analyzing powers .",
    "one reason is the different sign of the neutron and proton magnetic moments .",
    "the other reason is the interference with the coulomb field .",
    "however the mm interaction does not help for a better description of the neutron @xmath72 . on the contrary",
    "there is an appreciable improvement in the proton @xmath72 as well as in @xmath87 , in particular at very low energies .",
    "hence we can study the differences between the experimental data and the calculations at the peak and see if the inclusion of mm interaction helps to clarify a different behavior observed for @xmath47 and @xmath2 .",

    "the av18 and av18+mm results have been considered . for @xmath47",
    "both results are extremely close at the peak and only the av18 result has been considered .",
    "we see that without the inclusion of the mm interaction the underestimation of the proton @xmath72 is much more pronounced than the neutron @xmath72 . when the mm interaction is considered both , the @xmath47 and @xmath2 @xmath72 are predicted with a reduction of similar size ( around @xmath93% ) in all the energy interval below @xmath94 mev . above @xmath94",
    "mev the differences on the peak between theory and experiment diminish and practically disappear at @xmath95 mev . in fig.5",
    "we see that at @xmath96 mev the difference has been reduced to @xmath97% .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to perform detailed calculations to describe @xmath0 elastic scattering using a potential including the nuclear plus coulomb plus mm interactions . though the strength of the mm interaction is small compared to the nuclear one , its long range produces appreciable effects in some observables as the @xmath47 differential cross section and vector analyzing powers .",
    "for @xmath2 scattering we observed an increase in vector analyzing powers at low energies .",
    "the importance of coulomb effects has been analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite below @xmath95 mev .",
    "here we have shown that at @xmath4 mev coulomb effects are very reduced in most of the elastic observables with the exception of @xmath5 where an appreciable effect has been observed in the peak .    in the low energy regime",
    "the electromagnetic potential produces modifications in the observables that are of similar size to those ones produced by the most frequently used three  nucleon interactions , as the ur potential .",
