    "in perturbative qcd , observables are given by expansions in the strong coupling @xmath3 , @xmath4,\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath5 can be calculated from the appropriate feynman diagrams .",
    "the individual terms in the series depends on the renormalisation scheme one is using but the sum of the entire series is independent of the scheme according to the renormalisation group equation .",
    "however , when the series is truncated the result becomes renormalisation scheme dependent .",
    "this dependence is formally of higher order than the terms calculated in the series but numerically the difference between different schemes can be large .",
    "these differences give a theoretical uncertainty which in principle makes it impossible to make any absolute predictions since any result can be obtained by a finite renormalisation . by going to higher order in perturbation theory",
    "the renormalisation scheme dependence becomes smaller but in principle the problem remains .",
    "one can argue that it is only bad scheme choices that give ` crazy ' results and that as long as one uses a ` sensible ' scheme the result will also be ` sensible ' .",
    "the question then arises , what is a ` sensible ' scheme ?",
    "the question of how to choose an appropriate renormalisation scheme in qcd has been discussed many times .",
    "three well - known methods for choosing the renormalisation scheme are the ` effective charge scheme ' by grunberg @xcite , the ` principle of minimum sensitivity ' by stevenson @xcite and ` automatic scale fixing ' ( blm ) by brodsky , lepage and mackenzie @xcite .",
    "all these methods are based on some more or less intuitive principle or set of arguments for how a perturbative series should behave .    of special interest here",
    "is the blm method which fixes the scale in next - to - leading order ( nlo ) using conformal limit arguments . in a conformally invariant",
    "theory the coupling @xmath6 is scale invariant , i.e.@xmath7 it is therefore natural to define the conformal limit of perturbative qcd as the limit @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this means that the coefficients @xmath5 in the perturbative series have their conformal limit values if they do not contain any explicit dependence on the @xmath0-function .",
    "for example , in nlo the perturbative coefficients should have no explicit @xmath9-dependence . in the blm method",
    "this is achieved by absorbing all @xmath9-dependent nlo terms ( @xmath10 where @xmath11 number of active quark flavours ) into the running of @xmath3 by a suitable redefinition of the renormalisation scale .",
    "it should be noted that the renormalisation scale obtained by the blm method can also be interpreted as the mean value of the virtualities in the gluon propagators @xcite .    a useful concept when discussing renormalisation scheme uncertainties is the effective charge @xcite of an observable which contains all qcd - corrections . for example , the effective charge @xmath12 of @xmath13 is defined by , @xmath14 each effective charge has its own @xmath0-function @xcite connected to it , @xmath15 where @xmath9 and @xmath16 are renormalisation scheme independent and @xmath17 , @xmath18 are renormalisation scheme invariants .",
    "thus , for each physical observable @xmath19 there is a specific @xmath20 connected to it which is an inherent property of the effective charge .",
    "the perturbative series for an effective charge depends on the renormalisation scheme even in the conformally invariant theory but when two effective charges are related , one gets a relation that is independent of the intermediate scheme that was used .    in this paper",
    "we present a new generalisation of the blm method to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) using the conformal limit arguments as starting point which fixes both the renormalisation scale and @xmath1 when two physical observables are related .",
    "the value for @xmath1 that is obtained is an intermediate value between the @xmath21 s of the two effective charges .",
    "( a generalisation to the factorisation scheme problem will be considered in a separate paper @xcite ) .",
    "this is a variation of an approach by grunberg and kataev @xcite , but whereas they claimed that the prescription for making the coefficients @xmath22-independent is ambiguous , we will show that once the initial renormalisation scheme is fixed by relating two physical observables , the conformal limit arguments fixes the scheme in a unique way .",
    "we also compare with the single @xcite and multi - scale extensions @xcite of the blm method to nnlo which fixes the renormalisation scale when two effective charges @xmath19 and @xmath23 are related , @xmath24 , using @xmath25 . as an example",

    "all signs of scale breaking , i.e.  @xmath61 , is confined into the running of the coupling and the coefficients in the perturbative series have their conformal limit values .",
    "we have also shown ( contrary to @xcite ) that this prescription for making the coefficients have their conformal limit values is unique . comparing with earlier extensions of the blm method to nnlo they only fix the scale using @xmath1 from the effective charge .",
    "this means , that the conformal limit scheme fixing gives both a so called commensurate scale relation as well as a commensurate @xmath1 relation which , in a unique way , specifies how @xmath1 should be modified when two physical observables are related to each other .    applying the conformal limit scheme fixing method to the relation between bjorken s sum rule @xmath93 and @xmath2",
    "gives a simple relation between the two .",
    "using the effective charge value @xmath167 for @xmath164 gev from a global analysis of @xmath2 data gives @xmath185 for @xmath186 gev@xmath187 where the error comes from the experimental uncertainty in @xmath12 .",
    "assessing a theoretical error is much more complicated .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty is illustrated by the renormalisation scheme dependence which is shown to be quite large even though it can be reduced by requiring the scheme to belong to the perturbative regime .",
    "still , the problem of quantifying the theoretical error remains to be solved .",
    "however , comparing with the experimentally measured @xmath183 the agreement is good and theoretical uncertainties are still smaller than the experimental ones .",
