    "<S> in quantum mechanics students are taught to practice that eigenfunction of a physical bound state must be continuous and vanishing asymptotically so that it is normalizable in @xmath0 . here </S>",
    "<S> we caution that such states may also give rise to infinite uncertainty in position @xmath1 , whereas @xmath2 remains finite . </S>",
    "<S> such states may be called loosely bound and spatially extended states that may be avoided by an additional condition that the eigenfunction vanishes asymptotically faster than @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> the bound state is an essential topic in the curriculum of introductory quantum mechanics [ 1,2 ] . bound state eigenfunctions @xmath4 are solutions of the schrdinger ( 1926 ) equation [ 1,2 ] @xmath5\\psi(x)=0,\\ ] ] for some potential @xmath6 for specific allowed values of energies @xmath7 that obey dirichlet boundary condition @xmath8 energies @xmath9 are called eigenvalues leading to quantization of energy . </S>",
    "<S> this quantization was first hypothesized by planck(1900 ) for the explanation of the black body radiation and justified much later by bohr and sommerfeld ( 1919 ) [ 1,2 ] semi - classically for @xmath10 and other potential profiles with a single minimum called potential wells .    as @xmath11 plays the role of quantal probability </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath12 is taught to be continuous function on @xmath13 so that @xmath12 is square integrable ( normalizable ) @xmath14 the additional condition of differentiability of @xmath12 at each and every point of the domain ensures the continuity of the momentum : @xmath15 unless there is a dirac delta function in the potential [ 2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> when the potential contains a dirac delta function e.g , @xmath16 , the eigenfunction is allowed to become non - differentiable at @xmath17 wherein the left and right derivatives are finite but unequal at @xmath17 [ 3 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> further the uncertainty relation of heisenberg ( 1927 ) [ 1,2 ] @xmath18 requires the uncertainties @xmath19 and @xmath2 to be finite for physically relevant cases . an interesting collection of uncertainty products for ground states of several solvable models </S>",
    "<S> may be seen in ref.[4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it may be mentioned that nowadays , the terms `` uncertainty relation '' and `` uncertainty principle '' are classified clearly . </S>",
    "<S> the term `` uncertainty principle '' is used when an inequality expresses the relationship between measurement error and disturbance . for a recent and a very interesting discussion on this </S>",

    "<S> a definite integral @xmath20 is called proper if it represents area under the curve @xmath21 from @xmath17 to @xmath22 . this in turn requires @xmath23 to be continuous or piece - wise continuous in the closed interval @xmath24 $ ] . on the other hand , an improper [ 5 ] </S>",
    "<S> integral may not connect well to the area under the curve e.g. , @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> one way an integral becomes improper is when one or both of its limits are infinite . </S>",
    "<S> improper integrals may or may not be convergent ( finite ) . it is trivial yet important to see that the integral @xmath26 is convergent only if @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> this last point is crucial in determining the asymptotic behavior of @xmath12 such that @xmath28 is finite , see below .    </S>",
    "<S> the finiteness of @xmath19 requires @xmath28 to be finite , thus we demand @xmath29    on the other hand for @xmath30 and @xmath31 to be finite , @xmath32 would suffice well . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the condition ( 5 ) would ensure finiteness of the uncertainty product @xmath33 [ 5 ] . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we point out this additional condition ( 5 ) on the eigenfunction for a bound state </S>",
    "<S> .    one can write ( 1 ) in an interesting form as @xmath34 here we take @xmath35 which gives @xmath36 . it may be noted that for particle of mass 4 times that of an electron , the approximate value of @xmath37 is @xmath38 when the mass and energy are in @xmath39 and length is in @xmath40 . if we put the well known ground state of harmonic oscillator @xmath41 in ( 6 ) , we get @xmath42 </S>",
    "<S> . one may interpret that @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( or @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this @xmath6 is the harmonic oscillator potential ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ) @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 the ground state @xmath41 vanishes faster than @xmath3 because as @xmath50 , @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> so the uncertainty product @xmath52 for this ground state turns out to be finite as @xmath53 [ 1,2 ] , which equals the least bound on @xmath33 ( 4 ) for any physical eigenstate .    particularly , in this special case of harmonic oscillator constructing the raising and lowering operators [ 1,2 ] one can find all eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a rare feature of a potential .    </S>",
    "<S> but if we put @xmath54 in ( 6 ) , we get @xmath55 and @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) this @xmath6 is a double well and @xmath46 is the ground state of this potential that possesses infinitely many bound states . </S>",
    "<S> one can not construct the raising and lowering operators to obtain the rest of the spectrum of this double well potential . </S>",

    "<S> next , @xmath64 vanishes as there is an odd integrand within the symmetric limit of integration . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , @xmath65 in general for bound states as they do not carry any momentum . </S>",
    "<S> we can find @xmath28 @xmath66 and @xmath67 in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 7,8 ) , we have converted the integrals to the standard gamma functions as @xmath68 [ 8 ] . using ( 7,8 ) in ( 4 ) , we get the uncertainty product for ground state as @xmath69 which is more than @xmath70 as per the uncertainty principle .    similarly , the ground state @xmath71 vanishes a little faster than @xmath3 to have a well known value for @xmath72 [ 3 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us take a continuous , differentiable and normalized state as @xmath73 which behaves as @xmath74 as @xmath75 . for this state @xmath76 </S>",
    "<S> so both of these integrals ( 11 ) are improper . under the condition that the integration range becomes infinite while maintaining the left - right symmetry of the integration range </S>",
    "<S> , we get @xmath77 on the other hand the integral in @xmath78 is improper but convergent because its integrand vanishes as @xmath79 asymptotically and then it vanishes as its integrand is an odd function . </S>",
    "<S> similarly @xmath31 is improper but convergent because its integrand vanishes as @xmath80 asymptotically and it can be evaluated as shown below @xmath81~ d\\theta=\\frac{\\hbar^2}{8}.\\ ] ] in the integral above , we have used the substitution @xmath82 , finally we get a finite value of @xmath2 as @xmath83 eventually , eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 12,15 ) render the uncertainty product as infinite .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us find out from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 6 ) the potential giving rise to such a ground state ( 10 ) , we find @xmath84 this potential is depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) and the state ( 10 ) is its ground state with eigenvalue @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> no state can exist below @xmath85 as it is a node less ( ground state ) . </S>",
    "<S> for energies @xmath86 there are scattering states , there may also exist a metastable ( quasi bound , resonant state [ 9 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence the state ( 10 ) is the only bound state of this potential ( 16 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the examples of the ground states @xmath61 rendering a finite uncertainty products presented here are instructive which bring out the crucial role of faster asymptotic convergence of @xmath61 than @xmath3 . on the other hand the example ( 10 ) , demonstrates our point that if an eigenstate of a bound state does not vanish faster than @xmath3 , despite being continuous , differentiable and normalizable it would yield the uncertainty product @xmath33 as infinite .    similarly , for 3 dimensional central potentials [ 1,2 ] in the radial schrdinger equation , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 , @xmath89 needs to vanish faster than @xmath90 for the uncertainty @xmath91 to be finite .    as such @xmath19 or the uncertainty product becoming infinite </S>",
    "<S> does not violate the uncertainty relation ( 4 ) , this however may not be desirable either . </S>",
    "<S> notice that this ground state ( 10 ) is a much extended state that vanishes as @xmath74 asymptotically much slower as compared to the states in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a , b ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a state , if useful in future , may be called a loosely bound and spatially extended state . </S>"
