    "transport in normal metal - superconductor - normal metal ( n@xmath0sn@xmath1 ) three - terminal hybrid nanostructures has received a special attention , because those structures allow in principle to produce split pairs of spin - entangled electrons from a superconductor , acting as a cooper pair beam splitter@xcite .",
    "this is possible when the size of the region separating the n@xmath0s and the n@xmath1s interface becomes comparable to the superconducting coherence length , allowing coherent processes involving two quasi - particles , each simultaneously crossing one of the two interfaces @xcite .",
    "much effort has been devoted to the theoretical understanding and to the experimental observation of such a cooper pair splitting effect . in a transport experiment where electrons are difficult to measure one by one",
    " contrarily to the similar production of entangled photons ",
    ", one relies on steady transport measurement , e.g. the current - voltage characteristics ( conductance ) and the cumulants of the current fluctuations ( non - equilibrium current noise @xcite and its counting statistics @xcite ) .",
    "in practice , the conductance and the second - order cumulant ( the shot noise and the current cross - correlations between the two current terminals n@xmath0 , n@xmath1 ) are the quantities to be extracted from experiments . indeed ,",
    "due to fermi statistics , the  partition  noise correlations at a three - terminal crossing of normal metal contacts are negative  @xcite , manifesting the antibunching properties of individual electrons . if instead one contact is made superconducting , the cross - correlations may become positive , suggesting the splitting of cooper pairs  @xcite .",
    "two elementary nonlocal processes occur at a double nsn interface : crossed andreev reflection ( car ) which alone leads to cooper pair splitting into separated electrons bearing opposite spins ( for a spin singlet superconductor ) , and elastic cotunneling ( ec ) which alone leads to ( spin - conserving ) quasi - particle transmission between the normal contacts , across the superconducting gap @xcite . for tunnel contacts , at lowest order in the barrier transparencies ,",
    "those two processes are decoupled and simply related to the conductance , leading to positive ( resp .",
    "negative ) conductance and current cross - correlations for car ( resp .",
    "ec ) processes .",
    "indeed bignon _ etal .",
    "_  @xcite showed that for tunnel contacts the linear dependence of the current cross - correlation on the voltages applied to the contacts n@xmath0 , n@xmath1 allows to separately track the amplitudes of car and ec .",
    "due to the expected compensation of the opposite car and ec conductance components at low transparencies @xcite , ferromagnetic contacts are required to detect car and ec from the conductance with tunnel contacts @xcite . yet",
    ", such polarizations are not easily achievable , moreover , if one is interested in producing spin - entangled electrons in a nonlocal singlet state , one should of course not spin polarize the contacts .",
    "as regards experiments , the situation for ( extended ) tunnel barriers looks more complicated than given by a simple tunnel model @xcite .",
    "zero - frequency noise measurements can be carried out in low impedance sample ( current noise ) , or at high impedance ( voltage noise ) .",
    "the positive current - current cross correlations discussed here at high transparency may be measured in the setup of ref .",
    "using three squids as current amplifiers .",
    "it has been found theoretically that , at high transparency @xcite , the nonlocal conductance is negative , which leaves the current cross - correlations as the only possible probe of cooper pair splitting processes , provided one controls the voltages on both contacts .",
    "contrarily to conductance measurements with metals @xcite or quantum dots @xcite , cross - correlations have led to few experimental results @xcite . at the theoretical level ,",
    "the dependence of the cross - correlations on the contact transparency is not yet fully understood .    in view of the current experiments on metallic structures ,",
    "the main question is therefore : can the cross - correlations be positive , and if the answer is yes , is this a signature of cooper pair splitting ?",
    "previous work on a nsn structure  @xcite showed that the cross - correlations can indeed be positive at large transparencies , although the nonlocal conductance is negative .",
    "the origin of this somewhat surprising result was not fully elucidated .",
    "further work  @xcite showed that the sign of the cross - correlations indeed changes with the transparency of the interfaces , being positive at low transparency , negative at intermediate transparency and positive again at high transparency .",
    "while the positive sign at low transparency is clearly ascribed to cooper pair splitting , it was shown that the positive sign at high transparency should not be interpreted in the same way .",
    "indeed , at high transparency , car processes do not dominate either in the conductance or in the noise .",
    "instead , the positive cross - correlations should be ascribed to local andreev reflection ( ar ) on one side , and the opposite process on the other side , a process equivalent to exchanging a pair of electrons between the two normal contacts . in ref .",
    ", a quasiclassical analysis using a perturbative expansion in the nonlocal green s function connecting the two interfaces led to positive noise correlations at high transparencies , and the authors conclude that it is due to car .",
    "this interpretation looks surprising , given the domination of ec in the conductance in the same regime , and the total absence of car at high transparency in the transmission coefficient .",
    "we insist that it is of importance for the community , before embarking into experimental developments , to state clearly that positive cross - correlations should not be interpreted in terms of car at high transparencies .    to show that contacts with high transparency , or with effectively high transparency , are not suitable as a source of cooper pair splitting",
    ", we also investigate how the localizing effects of disorder influence the nonlocal conductance and the cross - correlations in a nsn structure . at a single ns interface",
    ", it was shown that disorder in the n region , or multiple scattering at a clean nn@xmath2s double interface , can strongly enhance andreev reflection , by a mechanism nicknamed  reflectionless tunneling",
    " @xcite . with a disordered @xmath3 region",
    ", it leads to a zero - bias anomaly below the thouless energy , where the mutual dephasing of electrons and andreev - reflected holes is negligible . in the case of a clean double nn@xmath2s interface , maximum andreev transmission",
    "is obtained by balancing the transparencies t@xmath4 and",
    "t@xmath5 of the nn@xmath2 and n@xmath2s interfaces , such that the n@xmath2 region acts as a resonant cavity . melsen and beenakker @xcite performed an average on the modes inside n@xmath2 in order to mimick a disordered region .",
    "we ask here the question of whether a similar mechanism can enhance nonlocal andreev reflection e.g. boost car compared to ar and ec .",
    "a zero - bias anomaly was obtained in ref .",
    ", within a quasiclassical analysis .",
    "its sign reveals an amplification of quasi - particle transmission .",
    "it is however not mentionned in this reference whether one should also expect boosting of the car channel , which is a requirement for experimental observation of cooper pair splitting .",
    "we demonstrate on the contrary that reflectionless tunneling in the nonlocal conductance is not accompagnied by reflectionless tunneling in the car channel .    the needed clarification , both for conductance and noise , comes from a model which is exactly solvable and where all local and nonlocal amplitudes can be clearly distinguished .",
    "this is an advantage over the quasiclassical approach used in ref .  , which does not produce separate expressions for the car and for the ec contributions to the conductance .",
    "thus , we use the scattering approach @xcite for a set - up n@xmath0n@xmath2sn@xmath6n@xmath1 with a quadruple interface .",
    "the scattering theory is performed in a one - dimensional geometry , varying the transparencies of the barriers and the width of the superconductor .",
    "it is known to reproduce the main qualitative features of realistic devices , and allows to account for any barrier transparency and any distance @xmath7 between the interfaces .",
    "it does not rely on any expansion in the nonlocal scattering matrix elements ( or green s functions ) .",
    "this is especially important if noticing that close to the gap edges , the relevant length scale for the penetration of evanescent quasiparticles ( thus for the andreev reflection ) diverges as @xmath8 .",
    "the scattering method only assumes a sharp variation of the order parameter at the interface , which is strictly valid for contact sizes smaller than @xmath9 .",
    "it should be modified to take into account self - consistency if @xmath10 , or to describe non - equilibrium effects .",
    "one advantage of the scattering approach is the precise bookkeeping of the scattering amplitudes associated to the various ( ar , car , ec ) processes .",
    "this allows an unambiguous diagnosis of cooper pair splitting in either the conductance or the noise , as obtained by simple expressions of these scattering amplitudes .    if averaging independently the modes in the left and the right regions n@xmath11 , no boosting of the car process is obtained . indeed ,",
    " reflectionless tunneling  is a quantum coherent process which demands that the andreev - reflected hole retrace the path of the electron , by scattering on the same impurities . on the contrary , with nonlocal andreev reflection , the electron and the transmitted hole sample different disorders and no coherence",
    "is obtained .",
    "this result does not contradict ref . which states that the total crossed conductance is enhanced .",
    "again , the scattering technique allows to track the different contributions , and the zero - bias anomaly is here due to the enhancement of the direct andreev reflection , not to car .    section  [ sec : papernsn : model ] presents the model and section  [ papernnsnn : sec : comp ] the scattering theory of the n@xmath0n@xmath2sn@xmath6n@xmath1 system .",
