    "the paradigm shift of reductionism to holism are in common use nowadays , turning the scientist s interests to the interdisciplinary approach @xcite .",
    "this endeavor may be accomplished as far as the fundamental concepts of complex network theory are applied on problems that may arise from many areas of study , like social networks , communication , economy , financial market , computer science , internet , world wide web , transportation , electric power distribution , molecular biology , ecology , neuroscience , linguistics , climate networks and so on @xcite .",
    "as the study of the objects under the network subject paradigm goes on @xcite , some classes may arise as function of their general structure or topology @xcite . given these structures ,",
    "some patterns may be perceived into the aspect of network measures that , in addiction to one another , may determine a class of networks @xcite . considering this one can define some sort of taxonomy of networks that can be built by the simple comparison regarding their topological properties @xcite . with conformity with this reasoning ,",
    "a notion of universality also may be used as key - concept to unify the various kinds of networks into characteristic groups @xcite .",
    "based on this concept of universality , carron and kenna @xcite proposed an analysis method to discriminate a given narrative into real or fictional , based on the social network it would represent .",
    "specifically they analyzed three classical narratives with uncertain historicity , which was : beowulf , iliad and tin b cuailnge @xcite .",
    "from these was created some sort of social networks where nodes would represent characters and edges their social relation in the tale . as result",
    ", it generated what was denominated the mythological networks .",
    "this type of network is essentially a social network with distinguished topological properties . in order to determine what is distinguished",
    ", we must first determine what is common in topological terms .",
    "the real social networks are known to be usually small world @xcite , hierarchically organized @xcite , highly clustered , assortatively mixed by degree @xcite , and scale free @xcite .",
    "in addition to these basic characteristics , real social networks also may show power law dependence of the degree distribution @xcite , hold a giant component with less than 90% of the total number of vertices , be vulnerable to targeted attacks and hold robustness to random attacks @xcite .    in the other extreme of a social networks configuration derived from a narrative ,",
    "there are the fictional social networks .",
    "these can be characterized as being small world , bear hierarchical structure , hold a exponential dependence of degree distribution , not scale free , size giant component with more than 90% of the total vertices , show no assortativity by degree and being robust to random or targeted attacks .",
    "its properties show some resembling features of real social networks .",
    "however a profound analysis would show their artificial nature @xcite .",
    "based on these set of classificatory properties , the authors of the preceding research figured out that iliad would be more realistic than fictional in term of its social network , whilst the other two ( beowulf and tin ) would be needed some simple and reasonable modification to render their network as real @xcite .",
    "although this made manipulation , they managed to synthesize a way to analyze folktales , myths or other classical poems , epics or narratives .",
    "this synthesis can be used to identify sociological structure which is valuable as a tool in the field of comparative mythology . conversely it is worth noting and citing    campbell s work the hero with a thousand faces , where is brought to light a notion that mythological narratives from diverse culture frequently share the same structure denominated the monomyth @xcite . with carron s and kenna s results and campbell s statement",
    ", we can build an idea that classic narratives tend overall to be based on some historicity mixed with some sort of myth or legend , turning a historical document more attractive to be passed throughout generations .",
    "inspired by this preceding speculation , we propose a social network analysis of the homeric greek epic odyssey @xcite . looking for some meaning in terms of its network topology , we will attempt to classify the resulting net into real or imaginary as well as considering its implication for the comparative mythology .",
    "in addition to this methodology , we shall also run an algorithm to discriminate the so called `` communities '' or modules into the network .",
    "the novelty of this work stands is to verify if these sub - social groupings ( i. e. communities ) may have meaning , in terms of its characters composition and within topology , long story shorting : what are their contribution to the odyssey s social network ?",
    "we shall perform this task through random walk algorithm @xcite . as far as the communities are found , an interpretation must follow concerning its characters composition , internal topology and its importance to the whole topological structure may follow .",
    "the first fundamental property that appears with a network is the total number of vertices n along with the total number of edges between nodes e. as the net is formed , each node will have a certain number of edges that make the connection to other vertices ; this will be the degree k of the vertex .",
    "the averaging over all degrees gives us the mean degree @xmath0 of the network .",
    "exploring a longer bit the degree property , we can derive @xmath1 , which represents the probability that a given node has degree @xmath2 , then for most real network the degree distribution holds for    @xmath3    for positive and constant @xmath4 .",
    "this is the power law dependency of degree distribution . for a network",
    "this reflects that the nodes are sparsely connected or there are little nodes with high degree and numerous vertices with low degree .",
    "the scale free characteristic of a network is maintained if [ eq1 ] is satisfied @xcite .",
    "some other important structural properties are also to be collected in the light of graph s theory , likely : the average path length @xmath5 , the longest geodesic @xmath6 and the clustering coefficient @xmath7 . consider a graph @xmath8 and its set of vertices @xmath9 . if @xmath10 are to be the shortest distance between the vertices @xmath11and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 ; assume that @xmath15",
    "if @xmath16 or @xmath11 ca nt reach @xmath12 . given these conditions we can define the average path length @xmath5 as    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the number of vertices of the graph @xmath8 .",
    "the longest geodesic , often known as diameter of a graph , consist simply in the largest value of @xmath19 or in other terms , the longest topological separation between all pairs of vertices of the graph .",
    "the third property @xmath7 , quantify to what extent a given neighborhood of the network is cliqued . if vertices @xmath20 has @xmath21 neighbors , we find out that the maximal number of potential links between them will be @xmath22 .",
    "analogous to this we define @xmath23 as the actual number of links between the @xmath21 neighbors of @xmath20 , the clustering coefficient @xcite of the node shall be defined as ,    @xmath24    where the clustering coefficient @xmath7 for the whole network is simply the averaging of [ eq2 ] .",
    "many real network show a modular structure implying that groups of nodes organize in a hierarchical manner into increasingly larger groups .",
    "this feature can be overviewed as the power - law dependency fitting of the averaged clustering coefficient versus degree @xcite :    @xmath25    additionally , we test the small - world phenomenon on the network . for",
    "that we sustain that the network will be small world if @xmath26 and @xmath27 are both satisfied @xcite .    where @xmath28 and @xmath29 , are respectively , the average path length and the clustering coefficient for a random network built with the same size @xmath30 and degree distribution @xcite .",
    "we also intent to measure the assortative mixing by degree , which brings the notion that nodes of high degree often associate with similarly highly connected nodes , while nodes with low degree associate with other less linked nodes .",
    "this quantity is given by the simple pearson correlation r for all pairs of @xmath31 nodes of the network .",
    "newman showed that real social network tend to be assortatively mixed by degree , conversely gleiser sustained that disassortativity of social network may signal artificiality , and in our context , a fictional social network @xcite .",
    "the size of the giant component @xmath32 is an important network property which , in some fashion , measure the connectivity capturing the maximal connected components of a network @xcite .",
    "it is also stated that in scale free networks , removal of influential nodes causes the giant component to break down quickly demonstrating vulnerability .",
    "this is an important feature of real social network may have .",
    "however the process depends on how we define the importance of a node in the network . as well as degree ,",
    "the `` betweenness '' centrality of a given node @xmath33 indicates how influential that node is in the net .",
    "this measure can be defined as an amalgamation of the degree and the total number of geodesics that pass through a vertex @xcite . if @xmath34  is the number of geodesics between vertices @xmath20 and @xmath35 and number of these which pass through node @xmath36 is @xmath37 , then the betweenness centrality of @xmath36  shall be given by    @xmath38    @xmath33 will be 1 if all geodesics pass through @xmath36 . with this node s importance defined , it is possible to perform the target attack , which is the removal of the most important nodes seeing how the size of the giant component behaves after the removal",
    "in addition to the target attack , we shall realize a random attack where , differently from the target attack ; the vertices to be removed are chosen at random .",
    "the main difference between these two kinds of attacks may show us some kind of intrinsic organization within the social network @xcite .    as a complement of all topological measurements described until now",
    ", we also applied an algorithm called walktrap that captures the dense subgroups within the network often known as `` communities '' via random walk @xcite .",
    "this method allows us to describe the `` communities '' composition in terms of its characters array and topological configurations .",
    "along with iliad , the odyssey of homer express with fierce and beauty the wonders of the remote greek civilization .",
    "the epics date around the viii century b.c .",
    ", after the writing system development using the phoenician alphabet @xcite .",
    "it is also known that odyssey carry some echoes from the trojan war narrated mainly on iliad .",
    "recalling again carron s and kenna s paper , from their three myths analyzed , the network of characters from iliad showed properties most similar to those of the real social networks . in addiction",
    "they maintained that this similarity perhaps reflects the archeological evidence supporting the historicity of some conflict occurred during the xii century b.c .",
    "the poem s title ( odyssey ) comes from the name of the protagonist , odysseus ( or ulysses , for the roman adaptation ) , son and successor of laertes , king of ithaca and husband of penelope .",
    "the epic has its center scenario on the protagonist journey back home after his participation on the trojan war .",
    "this saga takes odysseus ten years to reach ithaca after the ten years of warring @xcite .",
    "the epic poem is composed by 24 chants in hexameter verses , where the tale begin 10 years after the war in which odysseus fought siding with the greeks .",
    "worth noting that the narrative has inverse order : it starts with the closure , or the assembly of the gods when zeus decides odysseus s journey back to home .",
    "the text is structured on four main parts : the first ( chants i to iv ) , entitled `` assembly of the gods '' ; the second ( chants v to viii ) , `` the new assembly of the gods '' ; the third ( chants ix to xii ) , `` odysseus s narrative '' ; and forth ( chants xiii to xxiv ) , `` journey back home '' .",
    "odyssey s masterwork after all , holds a set of adventures often considered more complex than iliad ; it has many epopee aspects that are close to human nature , while the predominant aspect of iliad is to be heroic , legendary and of godlike wonders .",
    "however there is a consensus that odyssey completes iliad picture of the greek civilization , and together they hold the very witness geniality of homer , being both pieces of fundamental importance to universal poesy in the occident @xcite .    as a careful textual analysis was performed , we managed to identify 342 unique characters bounded socially by 1747 relations [ fig1 ] .",
    "we should point out that this network may be socially limited ; it rather captures some spotlights on the societies from that time @xcite .",
    "we define the social relation between two character when they ve met in the story , speak directly to each other , cite one another to a third or when it is clear they know each other . to avoid some possible misleading interpretation of the poem s social relations , we studied different translations and editions of odyssey @xcite .",
    "the basic differences from the odyssey s translations generated no significant deviation as the network creation process was made .",
    "a summary ( table [ tab1 ] ) of the found topological properties was compiled along with carron s and kenna s results for their described mythological networks @xcite .",
    "as expected , the social network analyzed has average path length similar to a random network build with same size and average degree .",
    "additionally it also has high clustering coefficient compared to random network indicating the small world phenomenon .",
    "the hierarchical feature of the network is displayed on [ fig2 ] , where the mean clustering coefficient per degree is plotted @xmath39 .",
    "it is possible to verify that nodes with smaller degree present higher clustering than those with higher degree , the decay these relation may follow approximately [ eq3 ] .",
    "we may interpret that high degree vertices integrate the small communities , generating the unification of the whole network .      .size",
