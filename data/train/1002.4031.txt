    "in noncentrosymmetric heavy fermion superconductors , in addition to strong electron correlation , there exists another key property , the anisotropic spin - orbit ( so ) interaction due to the lack of inversion symmetry .",
    "the anisotropic so interaction plays important roles both in the normal and the superconducting state , and is expected to lead to many interesting phenomena .",
    "@xcite for such phenomena , electron correlation is quite important , because it can largely enhance the effect of the so interaction .",
    "the interplay of the anisotropic so interaction and electron correlation is truly an unique nature in noncentrosymmetric heavy fermion compounds .",
    "@xcite in particular , such an interplay in the superconducting state has been attracting particular interest . in this context ,",
    "especially , cerhsi@xmath0  @xcite and ceirsi@xmath0  @xcite are promising candidates for the interplay , because they are considered to be located near the antiferromagnetic ( af ) qcps around which strong correlations through the spin fluctuations are essential .",
    "cerhsi@xmath0 and ceirsi@xmath0 are af metals at ambient pressure , and begin to exhibit superconductivity at some critical pressures @xmath6 where the nel temperatures seem to be suppressed to absolute zero . according to the neutron experiments for cerhsi@xmath0 , the af ordering vector is @xmath7 and the nature of",
    "the af order is spin density wave - like .",
    "@xcite this is different from cept@xmath0si in which the af seems to have localized nature and the superconductivity coexists with it even at zero applied pressure .",
    "@xcite in nmr experiments in ceirsi@xmath0 , @xmath8 is observed near the critical pressure , which is a characteristic behavior of the systems with 3-dimensional ( 3d ) af spin fluctuations .",
    "@xcite in addition , the resistivity @xmath9 in both cerhsi@xmath0 and ceirsi@xmath0 above the superconducting transition temperatures @xmath10 in some pressure regions near the qcp shows the anomalous @xmath11-linear dependence which is different from @xmath12 in canonical fermi liquids .",
    "@xcite    the qcp related phenomena are observed also in the superconducting state .",
    "the large jump in the heat capacity at @xmath10 in ceirsi@xmath0 can be attributed to the strong coupling effect due to the spin fluctuations .",
    "@xcite it has strong pressure dependence and is largely enhanced near @xmath6 .",
    "the most striking phenomena which would be related to the quantum criticality in cerhsi@xmath0 and ceirsi@xmath0 appear in the behaviors of the upper critical fields @xmath1 when the applied magnetic field is parallel to @xmath13-axis .",
    "@xcite the remarkable features of the experimental results are as follows .",
    "( i ) as the pressure approaches a critical value , @xmath1 exhibits extremely high value which exceeds the orbital limit as well as the pauli limit estimated by the conventional bcs theory .",
    "the observed @xmath14(t ) is the highest value among the heavy fermion superconductors ever discovered , although @xmath10 is merely @xmath15(k ) .",
    "( ii ) @xmath1 curves have downward curvatures and the increase is accelerated as the temperature is decreased , making a sharp contrast to any other superconductors in which the increase of @xmath1 becomes slower as @xmath11 is decreased .",
    "( iii ) @xmath1 increases very rapidly as the pressure approaches the critical value , while the pressure dependence of @xmath10 is moderate .",
    "these characteristic features strongly suggest that there exists a deep connection between the superconductivity and the magnetic quantum criticality . in the previous study",
    ", the present authors have shown that these experimental results are well explained as an interplay of the rashba so interaction due to the lack of inversion symmetry and the spin fluctuations near the qcp .",
    "@xcite    on the other hand , @xmath1 for in - plane fields differs from @xmath2 in some important features .",
    "@xmath4 is merely less than @xmath16(t ) and its pressure dependence is moderate , and the @xmath1 curves exhibit usual upward curvatures .",
    "@xcite this anisotropy in @xmath1 would be related to the rashba so interaction , since the fermi surface is asymmetrically distorted by the in - plane field and the pauli depairing effect plays essential roles .",
    "by contrast , the renormalization of the quasiparticle velocity by the spin fluctuations is almost isotropic , resulting in the enhanced orbital limiting field in all directions of the applied field .",
    "another interesting phenomenon in the noncentrosymmetric superconductors in applied magnetic fields is the helical vortex phase which has been discussed theoretically .",
    "@xcite in a helical vortex phase , the superconducting gap function is modulated in real space , @xmath17 with the modulation vector @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the strength of the so interaction , the fermi velocity , the fermi energy , and the bohr magneton , respectively . for 3d rashba superconductors for @xmath5 , however , it is pointed out that this phase modulation is just a translational shift of the vortex lattice and has no physical importance .",
    "@xcite several authors also have discussed a spatially modulated superconducting state under magnetic fields with a large @xmath21 which is continuously connected from @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite this large @xmath22 state corresponds to the fulde - ferrell - ovchinnikov - larkin ( fflo ) state .",
    "@xcite the stability of the modulating superconducting state with the large @xmath22 depends on the relative strength of the orbital depairing effect to the pauli depairing effect in the compounds .",
    "in this paper , we study the normal and the superconducting properties in noncentrosymmetric superconductors cerhsi@xmath0 and ceirsi@xmath0 .",
    "we examine the anomalous @xmath11-linear dependence of the resistivity in the normal state . in the previous studies,@xcite at very low temperatures",
    ", @xmath23 is predicted for 3d af spin fluctuations .",
    "the temperature dependence of the resistivity for 3d af spin fluctuations have been studied in detail by several authors  @xcite we , here , show that @xmath24 in cerhsi@xmath0 and ceirsi@xmath0 is actually due to the 3d af spin fluctuations . for the superconducting state , the upper critical fields both for @xmath25 and @xmath5 are investigated . for the calculation of @xmath1 , we derive a general formula which enables us to treat the pauli and the orbital depairing effects on an equal footing .",
    "we can also take into account the strong coupling effect for a given electronic structure .",
    "we calculate @xmath1 on the basis of the scenario that the superconductivity in cerhsi@xmath0 and ceirsi@xmath0 is mediated by the spin fluctuations , and show that the experimental features are well explained as an interplay of the spin fluctuations and the rashba so interaction .",
    "although the formula is applicable for general models , we use a phenomenological model to calculate @xmath1 and neglect the following two points in the model .",
    "one is the scattering processes in the pairing interaction in which spins of quasiparticles are flipped by the rashba so interaction .",
    "it is pointed out that such processes can enhance the admixture of the singlet and the triplet superconductivity ,  @xcite and the strength of the admixture affects @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite we show that the admixture is still small in cerhsi@xmath0 and ceirsi@xmath0 even if we include the spin - flip scattering processes .",
    "the other point is the applied field dependence of the spin fluctuations . because the applied field is so large in cerhsi@xmath0 and ceirsi@xmath0 especially for @xmath25 that one might think that the spin fluctuations are suppressed and they can not contribute to the enhancement of @xmath1 .",
    "we show that the spin fluctuations are robust against the applied field @xmath26 up to the strength of the rashba so interaction , @xmath27 , because the rashba so interaction tends to fix the directions of spins on the fermi surface and it competes with the zeeman effect .",
    "the consistency of our results with the experiments strongly supports the scenario that the superconductivity in cerhsi@xmath0 and ceirsi@xmath0 is mediated by the spin fluctuations near the af qcp .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : normal ] , we study the experimentally observed @xmath11-linear dependence of the resistivity . in sec.[sec : eliashberg ] , a general formula for the calculation of @xmath1 is derived from the eliashberg equation . the characteristic features of @xmath1 in cerhsi@xmath0 and ceirsi@xmath0 are well explained with the use of the formula in sec.[sec : hc2 ] .",
    "we discuss , in sec.[sec:2points ] , the spin - flip scattering processes in the pairing interaction and the magnetic field dependence of the spin fluctuations which are not included in the approximation used for the computation of @xmath1 .",
    "the summary is given in sec.[sec : summary ] .",
    "in this section , we discuss the temperature dependence of the resistivity near the af qcp in cerhsi@xmath0 and ceirsi@xmath0 . in ceirsi@xmath0 ,",
    "nmr @xmath28 behaves as @xmath29 in some pressure regions , which means that the character of the spin fluctuations is 3d antiferromagnetic .",
    "@xcite in noncentrosymmetric systems , however , spin fluctuations are not isotropic due to the anisotropic spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the anisotropy in the noninteracting susceptibility @xmath30 is of the order of @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the strength of the spin - orbit interaction and @xmath33 is the fermi energy .",
    "actually , in sec.[subsec : susc ] , we show that the anisotropy among @xmath34 and @xmath35 is very small within the random phase approximation .",
    "therefore , we can neglect the anisotropy of the spin fluctuations for the discussion of the resistivity and @xmath1 in cerhsi@xmath0 and ceirsi@xmath0 .    for the systems with 3d af spin fluctuations ,",
    "the resistivities are expected to be @xmath23 according to the previous studies .",
    "@xcite in cerhsi@xmath0 and ceirsi@xmath0 , however , the temperature dependence is @xmath24 near the af qcp .",
    "@xcite the resistivity due to the 3d af spin fluctuations was discussed by several authors , and @xmath24 behavior was found for the weakly disordered systems  @xcite and the clean systems .",
    "@xcite here , we show that the @xmath11-linear resistivity in cerhsi@xmath0 and ceirsi@xmath0 is naturally understood in terms of the 3d af spin fluctuations , and this behavior has basically nothing to do with the lack of inversion symmetry .",
    "cerhsi@xmath0 and ceirsi@xmath0 are heavy fermion systems with kondo temperature @xmath3650 - 100(k ) which is much higher than the superconducting transition temperature @xmath15(k ) .",
    "@xcite therefore , to study the properties at @xmath371 - 10(k ) , we consider the low energy quasiparticles mainly formed by @xmath38-electrons through the hybridizations with the conduction electrons .",

    "@xmath42 is introduced phenomenologically and represents the interaction between the quasiparticles by the strong spin fluctuations near the af qcp .",
    "since cerhsi@xmath0 and ceirsi@xmath0 have body - centered tetragonal lattice structures with lattice spacing @xmath43 ,  @xcite the dispersion relation @xmath44 and the rashba type so interaction are approximated by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the lattice constant and @xmath47 is the chemical potential .",
    "although @xmath48 in this section , we include the zeeman effect in the action for the later discussion .",
    "we fix the parameters as @xmath49 by taking @xmath50 as the energy unit .",
    "the fermi surface determined by these parameters is in qualitative agreement with the band calculation and can reproduce the peak structures of the momentum - dependent susceptibility observed by the neutron scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "since we consider @xmath38-electron systems , we assume that the above parameters include effects of the mass renormalization due to local spin correlations with typical energy scale @xmath51 50 - 100 ( k ) , the kondo temperature ; i.e. @xmath52 50 - 100 ( k ) .",
    "the interactions are phenomenologically introduced through the renormalized susceptibility @xmath53 ,  @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are respectively the susceptibility , the length scale and the energy scale of spin fluctuations without strong correlations .",
    "these quantities are renormalized through the coherence length @xmath58 as the system approaches the qcp .",

    ", in cerhsi@xmath0 and ceirsi@xmath0 , the so interaction makes the superconductivity orbital limited , the huge @xmath1 is a result of the interplay of the rashba so interaction and the electron correlations .",
    "generally , such strong enhancement in the pairing interaction and the suppression of the quasiparticle damping at low temperatures are crucial for orbital limited superconductors , because @xmath223 is largely affected by the electron correlations compared with @xmath224 .",

    "therefore , we expect that , in this high field region , the fflo state with the gap function @xmath361 + \\eta_{-}\\exp [ i{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ q$}}_-\\cdot { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}}]$ ] can be realized .",
    "we have performed the calculations for other parameters , and confirmed that the threshold @xmath351 for the two region depends on the effective mass @xmath232 .",
    "as @xmath232 becomes larger , @xmath352 decreases , and vice versa , which means that the orbital depairing effect plays important roles for the determination of @xmath352 . to discuss the stability of such a state",
    ", we need to compute the free energy in the superconducting state , and it is beyond the linearized calculation of @xmath1 performed in the present study .    as mentioned in sec.[sec : eliashberg ] , @xmath75 can not be determined uniquely in our theory , and we can change the value of @xmath75 within the range for which the value of @xmath10 is consistent with the experiments . in the following ,",
    "we study the case of @xmath362 which gives @xmath363 . in this case",
    ", the value of @xmath50 is @xmath271(k ) and the effective mass of the cyclotron motion @xmath232 is large compared with the @xmath268(k ) case .",
    "we show @xmath1 for @xmath364 in fig.[fig : h_ab_15 ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     these behaviors are basically the same as those for @xmath365 , and assert the robustness of the spin fluctuations against the in - plane field .    from the above results , we see that neglecting the field dependence in the pairing interaction for any field direction is legitimate provided @xmath366 .",
    "although @xmath1 is huge in cerhsi@xmath0 and ceirsi@xmath0 especially for @xmath367-axis , the condition @xmath366 is expected to be satisfied . therefore , the discussion of @xmath1 in sec.[sec : hc2 ] is not changed even if we consider the field dependence of the spin fluctuations .",
    "we have discussed the normal and the superconducting properties in noncentrosymmetric heavy fermion superconductors cerhsi@xmath0 and ceirsi@xmath0 . we have shown that the @xmath11-linear dependence of the resistivity above @xmath10 observed experimentally is naturally understood within the 3d spin fluctuations near the af qcp .",
    "for the superconducting state , we have derived a formula from the eliashberg equation in real space .",
    "the formula enables us to treat the pauli and the orbital depairing effects on an equal footing .",
    "furthermore , by using it , we can calculate @xmath1 for strong coupling superconductors with general fermi surfaces .",
    "we have calculated @xmath1 with the formula and have well explained the observed features of @xmath1 in cerhsi@xmath0 and ceirsi@xmath0 . for @xmath25 , @xmath224 is infinitely large due to the rashba so interaction , and @xmath1 is determined by @xmath223 . as temperature is lowered and the system approaches the qcp , the pairing interaction becomes larger while the quasiparticle life time becomes longer , which results in the huge @xmath368 with the strong pressure dependence .",
    "the enhancement of the orbital limiting field near qcps by this mechanism would be universal .",
    "we have also discussed the case for @xmath5 . in this case , the pauli depairing effect is significant because of the asymmetric distortion of the fermi surface , and resulting @xmath1 is moderate against the pressure . the fflo state can be stabilized for a large @xmath26 region , although such a region is very small .",
    "the features of the calculated @xmath1 for both @xmath25 and @xmath5 are in good agreement with the experiments .",
    "this consistency supports the scenario that the superconductivity in cerhsi@xmath0 and ceirsi@xmath0 is mediated by the spin fluctuations near the af qcp .    in the last section ,",
    "we have checked the legitimacy of our approximation used for the calculation of @xmath1 . in cerhsi@xmath0 and ceirsi@xmath0 , the admixture of the singlet and the triplet gap functions are small even if we take into account the spin - flip scattering processes in the pairing interaction . in noncentrosymmetric systems ,",
    "the spin susceptibility is robust against the applied magnetic fields @xmath27 .",
    "for this reason , the spin fluctuations near the af qcp in cerhsi@xmath0 and ceirsi@xmath0 remain strong even under a large magnetic field @xmath285 ( t ) .",
    "therefore , the above mentioned results for @xmath1 is not changed if we refine our approximation used in the calculation of @xmath1 .",
