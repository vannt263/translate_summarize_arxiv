    "the phenomenon of soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) may allow us in the near future to determine fundamental properties of strongly magnetized , compact stars .",
    "already , there exist at least two sources in which quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) have been observed in their x - ray tail , following the initial discovery by @xcite , see @xcite for a recent review .",
    "the frequency of many of these oscillations is similar to what one would expect for torsional modes of the solid crust of a compact star .",
    "this observation is in support of the proposal that sgrs are magnetars ( compact objects with very strong magnetic fields ) @xcite . during an sgr event ,",
    "torsional oscillations in the solid crust of the star could be excited @xcite , leading to the observed frequencies in the x - ray tail .",
    "however , not all of the observed frequencies fit the above picture .",
    "for example , the three lowest observed frequencies for sgr 1806 - 20 are 18 , 26 , 30hz",
    ". only one of these could be the fundamental , @xmath6 torsional frequency of the crust , as the first overtone has a much higher frequency .",
    "@xcite stressed the importance of crust - core coupling by a global magnetic field and of the existence of an alfvn continuum , while @xcite considered model with simplified geometry , in which alfvn oscillations form a discrete spectrum of normal modes , that could be associated with the observed low - frequency qpos . in @xcite , the existence of a continuum was stressed further and it was shown that the edges or turning points of the continuum can yield long - lived qpos .",
    "in addition , numerical simulations showed that drifting qpos within the continuum become amplified near the frequencies of the crustal normal modes . within this model ,",
    "levin suggested a likely identification of the 18hz qpo in sgr 1806 - 20 with the lowest frequency of the mhd continuum or its first overtone .",
    "the above results were obtained in toy models with simplified geometry and newtonian gravity .    in this letter , we perform two - dimensional numerical simulations of linearized alfvn oscillations in magnetars .",
    "our model improves on the previously considered toy models in various ways : relativistic gravity is assumed , various realistic equations of state ( eos ) are considered and a consistent dipolar magnetic field is constructed .",
    "we do not consider the presence of a solid crust , but only examine the response of the ideal magnetofluid to a chosen initial perturbation .",
    "spherical stars have generally two type of oscillations , _ spheroidal _ with polar parity and _ toroidal _ with axial parity .",
    "the observed qpos in sgr x - ray tails may originate from toroidal oscillations , since these could be excited more easily than poloidal oscillations , because they do not involve density variations .",
    "in newtonian theory , there have been several investigations of torsional oscillations in the crust region of neutron stars ( see e.g. , @xcite for reference ) . on the other hand ,",
    "only few studies have taken general relativity into account @xcite .",
    "sgrs produce giant flares with peak luminosities of @xmath7 ",
    "@xmath8 erg / s , which display a decaying tail for several hundred seconds .",
    "up to now , three giant flares have been detected , sgr 0526 - 66 in 1979 , sgr 1900 + 14 in 1998 , and sgr 1806 - 20 in 2004 .",
    "the timing analysis of the latter two events revealed several qpos in the decaying tail , whose frequencies are approximately 18 , 26 , 30 , 92 , 150 , 625 , and 1840 hz for sgr 1806 - 20 , and 28 , 53 , 84 , and 155 hz for sgr 1900 + 14 , see @xcite .    in @xcite ( hereafter paper  i ) , it was suggested that some of the observational data of sgrs could agree with the crustal torsional oscillations , if , e.g. , frequencies lower than 155 hz are identified with the fundamental oscillations of different harmonic index @xmath9 , while higher frequencies are identified with overtones .",
    "however , in paper  i and above , it will be quite challenging to identify all observed qpo frequencies with only crustal torsional oscillations .",
    "for example , it is difficult to explain all of the frequencies of 18 , 26 and 30 hz for sgr 1806 - 20 with crustal models , because the actual spacing of torsional oscillations of the crust is larger than the difference between these two frequencies .",
    "similarly , the spacing between the 625hz and a possible 720hz qpo in sgr 1806 - 20 may be too small to be explained by consecutive overtones of crustal torsional oscillations .",
    "one can notice , however , that the frequencies of 30 , 92 and 150 hz in sgr 1806 - 20 are in near _",
    "integer ratios_. as we will show below , the numerical results presented in this letter are compatible with this observation , as we find two families of qpos ( corresponding to the edges or turning points of a continuum ) with harmonics at near integer multiples .",
    "furthermore , our results are compatible with the ratio of 0.6 between the 18 and 30hz frequencies , if these are identified , as we suggest , with the edges ( or turning points ) of the alfvn continuum . with this identification",
    ", we can set an upper limit to the dipole magnetic field of @xmath1 to @xmath10 g . if the drifting qpos of the continuum are amplified at the fundamental frequency of the crust , and the latter is assumed to be the observed 26hz for sgr 1806 - 20 , then our results are compatible with a magnetar mass of about @xmath4 to 1.6@xmath5 and an eos that is very stiff ( if the magnetic field strength is near its upper limit ) or moderately stiff ( for lower values of the magnetic field ) .    unless otherwise noted , we adopt units of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively , while the metric signature is @xmath14 .",
    "the general - relativistic equilibrium stellar model is assumed to be spherically symmetric and static , i.e. a solution of the well - known tov equations for and perfect fluid and metric described the line element @xmath15 we neglect the influence of the magnetic field on the structure of the star , since the magnetic field energy , @xmath16 , is orders of magnitudes smaller than the gravitational binding energy , @xmath17 , for magnetic field strengths considered realistic for magnetars , @xmath18 . for simplicity , we assume that the magnetic field is a pure dipole ( toroidal magnetic fields will be treated elsewhere , see @xcite .",
    "details on the numerical method for constructing the magnetic field , as well as representative figure of the magnetic field lines , can be found in paper  i.    mhd oscillations of the above equilibrium model are described by the linearized equations of motion and the magnetic induction equations , presented in detail in papers  i and ii ( we neglect perturbations in the spacetime metric , as these couple weakly to toroidal modes in a spherically symmetric background ) .",
    "the perturbative equations presented in papers  i and ii can readily be converted from an eigenvalue problem to the form of a two - dimensional time - evolution problem , by defining a displacement @xmath19 due to the toroidal motion ( the coefficient of shear viscosity is set to @xmath20 , as we neglect the presence of a solid crust in the present work ) .",
    "the contravariant _ coordinate component _ of the perturbed four - velocity , @xmath21 , is then related to time derivative of @xmath22 through @xmath23 the two - dimensional evolution equation for @xmath19 is @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are functions of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , given by @xmath33 e^{-2(\\phi - \\lambda ) } , \\\\   { \\cal a}_{20 } &",

    "several of the low - frequency qpos observed in the x - ray tail of sgr 1806 - 20 can readily be identified with the alfvn qpos we compute . in particular , one could identify the 18hz and 30hz observed frequencies with the fundamental lower and upper qpos , correspondingly , while the observed frequencies of 92hz and 150hz would then be integer multiples of the fundamental upper qpo frequency ( three times and five times , correspondingly ) . with this identification , our empirical relations eqs .",

    "furthermore , an identification of the observed frequency of 26hz with the frequency of the fundamental torsional @xmath3 oscillation of the magnetar s crust ( eq . ( 79 ) of paper  i ) implies a very stiff equation of state and a mass of about 1.4 to 1.6@xmath5 .",
    "for example , for the @xmath65 model constructed with eos l+dh , one obtains the following frequencies : @xmath66hz , @xmath67hz , @xmath68hz , @xmath69hz and @xmath70hz , for @xmath71 g.    alternatively , one could also identify the 18hz and 30hz observed frequencies with overtones ( which are also at a near 0.6 ratio ) . in this case ,",
    "the strength of the magnetic field derived above is only an upper limit and the actual magnetic field may be weaker .",
    "then , if one assumes that the observed frequency of 26hz is due to the fundamental @xmath3 crust mode for a weak magnetic field , our numerical data agree best with a  1.4@xmath5 model constructed with an eos of moderate stiffness .",
    "for example , for the 1.4@xmath5 model constructed with the apr+dh eos one obtains @xmath72hz , @xmath73hz , @xmath74hz , @xmath75hz and @xmath76hz , for @xmath77 g.",
    "we have already verified that our main qpo frequencies agree with frequencies obtained with an independent , fully nonlinear numerical code @xcite , for the same initial model .",
    "we caution , however , that we have not yet considered the crust - core interaction , different magnetic field topologies or the coupling to the exterior magnetosphere .",
    "these effects have to be taken into account and already @xcite , find that the observed qpos could lead to constraints on the magnetic field topology . to complete the picture , a three - dimensional numerical simulation , that includes a proper coupling of the crust to the mhd interior and to the exterior magnetosphere will be required and our current results provide a good starting point .",
    "extensive details of our computations will be presented in @xcite .",
