    "despite the large diversity of their microstructures , the so called soft glassy materials  @xcite like pastes , dense colloidal suspensions , granular systems and foams exhibit many common rheological properties . once in a glassy or `` jammed '' state ,",
    "these systems do not flow , if a small shear stress is applied on them .",
    "for stresses slightly above a certain threshold value ( the yield stress , @xmath2 ) , however , they no longer resist to the imposed stress and a flow pattern is formed  @xcite .",
    "let us illustrate this behavior using results of simulations to be described in more detail in later sections .",
    "figure  [ vcm_rcm_profile_dz1_sigma0.54 - 0.70 ] shows @xmath5 , the maximum velocity in the system measured close to the left wall during simulations of a 80:20 binary lennard - jones ( lj ) mixture  @xcite while applying a constant shear stress to the left wall ( see section  [ section : model ] for more details on the model ) .",
    "the applied stress is increased stepwise by an amount of @xmath6 every @xmath7 lj time units and @xmath5 is measured between two increments of the stress ( note that , as seen from the inset of the same figure , this time is long enough in order to also determine the velocity profile , @xmath8 , accurately ) .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ vcm_rcm_profile_dz1_sigma0.54 - 0.70 ] that , for stresses @xmath9 , @xmath5 is hardly distinguishable from zero .",
    "in particular , it is much smaller than the thermal velocity of the wall , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is the mass of the wall and @xmath12 the temperature ) .",
    "thus , at these stresses , the system remains in the jammed state and resists to the drag force transmitted to it by the left wall .",
    "however , as the stress is further increased , a remarquable change in the system mobility is observed .",
    "the system starts to flow and @xmath5 increases by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "an inspection of the corresponding velocity profiles illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ vcm_rcm_profile_dz1_sigma0.54 - 0.70 ] reveals a further feature related to the yield stress , namely that , once the applied stress exceeds the yield value , the whole system fluidizes and the velocity profile is practically linear ( velocity profiles corresponding to @xmath9 fluctuate around zero and are not shown in the inset ) .    on the other hand , in experiments upon imposed shear rate , shear thinning",
    "is observed  @xcite . the apparent viscosity , defined as the average stress divided by the average overall shear rate , @xmath13 , decreases with increasing @xmath14 ( in the case of a planar couette - flow with wall velocity and separation @xmath15 and @xmath16 , for example , @xmath17 ) .",
    "furthermore , over some range of shear rates , the system separates into regions with different velocity gradients ( shear bands )  @xcite .",
    "whereas the shear thinning is commonly attributed to the acceleration of the intrinsic slow dynamics by the external flow ( the new time scale , @xmath18 , is much shorter than the typical structural relaxation time of the system )  @xcite , the origin of the shear bands still remains to be clarified . in some cases",
    ", this shear - banding phenomenon can be understood in terms of underlying structural changes in the fluid , analogous to a first order phase transition .",
    "examples are systems of rod like particles , entangled polymers or surfactant micelles where the constituents ( rods , polymer or surfactant molecules ) gradually align with increasing shear rate thus leading to a coupling between the local stress and the spatial variation of the velocity gradient  @xcite . in the case of soft glassy materials , however , no such changes are evident , and coexistence appears between a completely steady region ( zero shear rate ) and a sheared , fluid region  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in a previous work  @xcite that a model of 80:20 binary lennard - jones glass  @xcite also exhibits the shear banding phenomenon .",
    "furthermore , a link was suggested between the occurence of shear bands and the existence of a static yield stress in the system .",
    "it was found that [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ] the yield stress is larger than the steady state stress measured in a steady shear experiment in the limit of the zero shear rate , @xmath19 .",
    "it was then suggested that , a shear - banding could be expected for shear rates , for which @xmath20 : as the flow is imposed externally ( by moving , say , the left wall ) the formation of a flow pattern is unavoidable . on the other hand",
    ", it follows from @xmath21 that , some regions in the system are `` rigid enough '' to resist to the flow - induced stress whereas other regions undergo irreversible rearrangements more easily  @xcite . hence , whereas the details of the `` nucleation '' and growth of a heterogeneous flow pattern may depend on the initial heterogeneity in the `` degree of jamming ''  @xcite , `` free volume ''  @xcite or `` fluidity ''  @xcite at the beginning of the shear motion , its very origin lies in the possibility of resisting to the shear - induced stress , i.e. in the existence of a static yield stress .    therefore , although it does not solve the problem of the selection between the two bands , the existence of a static yield stress is at least consistent with the coexistence of a jammed region and a fluidized band : once the yield stress @xmath22 is added to the flow curve , the shear rate becomes multivalued in a range of shear stresses , a situation encountered in several complex fluids  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon should thus be generic for many soft glassy materials .",
    "in this paper we present an extensive study of the stress - strain relations and yielding properties of the present model .",
    "the report is organized as follows .",
    "after the introduction of the model in the next section , results on the system response to an imposed overall shear rate are presented , and the effects of physical aging , shear rate and temperature on the stress - strain curves are investigated . in section  [ section : imposedstress ] , the response of the system to imposed stress is studied . the measurement of the static yield stress in the subject of section  [ section : yieldstress ] .",
    "a summary compiles our results .",
    "we performed molecular dynamics simulations of a generic glass forming system , consisting of a 80:20 binary mixture of lennard - jones particles ( whose types we call a and b ) at a total density of @xmath23 .",
    "a and b particles interact via a lennard - jones potential , @xmath24 $ ] , with @xmath25 .",
    "the parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 define the units of energy , length and mass .",
    "the unit of time is then given by @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , we choose @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the potential was truncated at twice the minimum position of the lj potential , @xmath35 .",
    "note that the density is kept constant at the value of @xmath36 for all simulations whose results are reported here .",
    "this density is high enough so that the pressure in the system is positive at all studied temperatures .",
    "the present model system has been extensively studied in previous works  @xcite and exhibits , in the bulk state , a computer glass transition ( in the sense that the relaxation time becomes larger than typical simulation times ) at a temperature of @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "since our aim is to study the interplay between the yield behavior and the possible flow heterogeneities , we do not impose a constant velocity gradient over the system as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a homogeneous shear flow was imposed through the use of lees - edwards boundary conditions .",
    "rather , we confine the system between two solid walls , which will be driven at constant velocity . by doing so",
    ", we mimic an experimental shear cell , without imposing a uniform velocity gradient .",
    "we first equilibrate a large simulation box with periodic boundary conditions in all directions , at @xmath38 .",
    "the system is then quenched to a temperature below @xmath39 , where it falls out of equilibrium , in the sense that structural relaxation times are by orders of magnitude larger than the accessible simulation times . on the time",
    "scale of computer simulation , the system is in a glassy state , in which its properties slowly evolve with time towards the ( unreachable ) equilibrium values ( aging , see fig .",
    "[ fig : msd_aging ] ) . after a time of @xmath40 [ @xmath41 md steps ] ,",
    "we create 2 parallel solid boundaries by freezing all the particles outside two parallel @xmath42-planes at positions @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshot ] ] . for each computer experiment , 10 independent samples ( each containing 4800 fluid particles ) are prepared using this procedure .",
    "note that the system is homogeneous in the @xmath42-plane ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "we thus compute local quantities like the velocity profile , the temperature profile , etc . as an average over particles within thin layers parallel to the wall .",
    "the amorphous character of our model is clearly seen by an analysis of the packing structure , i.e. the radial pair distribution function .",
    "figure  [ fig : pairdist ] shows the various kinds of radial pair distribution functions which can be defined for a binary mixture : @xmath46 is the probability ( normalized to that of an ideal gas ) of finding a particle of type @xmath47 at a distance @xmath48 of a @xmath49-particle ( @xmath50 ) . in order to demonstrate that the system keeps its amorphous structure at temperatures far below the glass transition temperature of the model , we show the mentioned pair distribution functions at two characteristic temperatures , one in the supercooled state ( @xmath51 ) and one at @xmath12 . as seen from fig .",

    "at this temperature , time translation invariance does not hold and the dynamical quantities depend on _ two _ times : the actual time , @xmath58 , and the waiting time @xmath59 . here",
    ", @xmath59 is the time elapsed after the temperature quench ( from @xmath38 to @xmath12 ) and the beginning of the measurement .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : msd_aging ] , where the mean square displacement ( msd ) of a tagged particle is shown at a temperature _ above _ @xmath4 ( @xmath56 ) and at @xmath12 ( far below @xmath4 ) for various waiting times .",
    "the figure nicely demonstrates the establishing of the time translation invariance ( tti ) at @xmath56 .",
    "here , @xmath60 corresponds to a change of temperature from @xmath38 to @xmath56 .",
    "as expected from the fact that @xmath56 belongs to the supercooled ( liquid ) state , with increasing waiting time , the msd converges towards the equilibrium curve reaching it after about @xmath7 lennard - jones time units .",
    "it is worth noting that the waiting time at which the tti is recovered roughly corresponds to the time needed for the msd to reach the size of a particle .    at @xmath56 , the equilibrium curve for the msd exhibits the well - known two step relaxation characteristic of supercooled liquid : for short times ( @xmath61 )",
    ", free particle motion with thermal velocity is observed ( @xmath62 ^ 2 { \\!=\\!}(\\bm{v}^{\\text th}t)^2 { \\!=\\!}3{k_{\\text { b}}}t t^2 $ ] ) .",
    "the free ( ballistic ) motion ends up in a plateau thus indicating the ( temporal ) arrest of the tagged particle in the cage formed by its neighbours .",
    "already after a few hundred lj time units , the plateau is gradually left and the msd crosses over towards a linear dependence on time ( diffusive regime ) .",
    "this is indicative of cooperative relaxation processes leading to the final release of the tagged particle from the cage ( cage relaxation ) .    at @xmath12 , however , the situation is completely different . here , tti is not reached on the simulation time scale . even after a waiting time of @xmath63 lj time units",
    ", the msd continues slowing down without reaching a steady state .",
    "the slowing down of the dynamics with @xmath59 also has a direct consequence on the life time of the cage .",
    "figure  [ fig : msd_aging ] shows that , as @xmath59 increases , so also does the width of the plateau . hence , the time necessary for the cage relaxation increases continuously with @xmath59 .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath64 , one can observe the very beginning of the cage relaxation around @xmath65 .",
    "as will be discussed in section  [ section : imposedshear ] , this has an important consequence for the shear rate dependence of @xmath66 , the stress at the maximum of stress - strain curves .",
    "an overall shear rate is imposed by moving in the @xmath53-direction , say , the left wall ( @xmath67 ) with a constant velocity of @xmath68 .",
    "this defines the total shear rate @xmath69 .",
    "the motion of the wall is realized in two different ways .",
    "one method used in our simulations is to move all wall atoms with strictly the same velocity . in this case ,",
    "wall atoms do not have any thermal motion . as a consequence , the only way to keep the system temperature constant , is to thermostat the fluid atoms directly . a different kind of wall motion is realized by coupling each wall atom to its equilibrium lattice position via a harmonic spring  @xcite . in this case , the lattice sites are moved with a strictly constant velocity while each wall atom is allowed to move according to the forces acting upon it [ the harmonic forces ensure that the wall atoms follow the motion of the equilibrium lattice sites ] .",
    "in such a situation , we can thermostat the wall atoms while leaving the fluid particles unperturbed .",
    "the temperature of the inner part of the system is then a result of the heat exchange with the walls ( which now act as a heat bath ) .",
    "this method has the advantage of leaving the fluid dynamics unperturbed by the thermostat .",
    "the drawback of thermostating the system through the heat exchange with the walls is that , depending on the shear rate and the stiffness of the harmonic spring , measured by the spring constant @xmath70 , a temperature profile can develop across the system .",
    "note that the smaller the harmonic spring constant , the better the heat exchange with the walls and thus the more efficient the system is thermostated ( the imposed shear rate having the opposite effect ) .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath70 is too small , the fluid particles may penetrate the walls .",
    "we find that @xmath71 is a reasonable choice for our model .",
    "however , even with this value of the harmonic spring constant , we observe a temperature profile as the shear rate exceeds @xmath72 . for @xmath73 , for example , the maximum temperature in the fluid is by about @xmath74 higher than the prescribed value .    in order to prevent such uncontrolled temperature increases ,",
    "we have therefore decided to apply direct thermostating to the inner particles at all shear rates , independently of the possibility of the heat exchange with the walls . for this purpose",
    ", we divide the system into parallel layers of thickness @xmath75 and rescale ( once every 10 integration steps ) the @xmath54-component of the particle velocities within the layer , so as to impose the desired temperature @xmath52 .",
    "such a local treatment is necessary to keep a homogeneous temperature profile when flow profiles are heterogeneous . to check for a possible influence of the thermostat , we compared , for low shear rates ( @xmath76 )",
    ", these results with the output of a simulation where the inner part of the system was unperturbed and the walls were thermostatted instead .",
    "both methods give identical results , indicating that the system properties are not affected by the thermostat .",
    "however , for wall velocities close to @xmath77 or larger ( corresponding to overall shear rates of @xmath78 ) , a non - uniform temperature profile develops across the system even if the velocities are rescaled extremely frequently  @xcite .",
    "this can be rationalized as follows .",
    "the heat created by the shear motion needs approximately @xmath79 to transverse the system ( @xmath80 is the sound velocity )",
    ". we can estimate the sound velocity from a knowledge of the shear modulus , @xmath81 , and the density of the system , @xmath82 . at @xmath12",
    "we find @xmath83 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : stress - strain::gammadot_effect ] ) thus obtaining @xmath84 .",
    "a time of @xmath85 is therefore needed for a signal to transverse the whole system .",
    "note that the heat creation rate is given by @xmath86 ( neglecting inhomogeneities in the local shear rate ) .",
    "an amount of energy equal to @xmath87 is thus generated within @xmath88 .",
    "the requirement @xmath89 now means that the heat creation must be slow enough so that the created energy can be dissipated in the whole system efficiently .",
    "this gives @xmath90 , which , after setting @xmath12 and @xmath91 , yields @xmath92 .",
    "figure  [ fig : stress - strain::gammadot_effect ] shows a typical set of ( transient ) stress - strain curves at a temperature of @xmath12 and for a waiting time of @xmath93 lj time units .",
    "the varying parameter is the overall shear rate @xmath17 ( the strain is simply computed as @xmath94 ) .",
    "first , an elastic regime is observed at small shear deformations ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "the stress then increases up to a maximum , @xmath66 , before decreasing towards the steady state stress at large deformations .",
    "therefore , this maximum is sometimes referred to as the yield point  @xcite or dynamical yield stress  @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will simply refer to this quantity as @xmath66 , since plastic ( irreversible ) deformation actually sets in before the corresponding value of the strain is reached .",
    "moreover , as will be seen below , @xmath66 depends on strain rate and waiting time in a nontrivial way , so that it is difficult , in our simulations , to define a yield stress value from such dynamical stress / strain curve .",
    "as commonly observed in experiments on polymers  @xcite and on metallic glasses  @xcite , the stress overshoot @xmath66 decreases and is observed at smaller strains as the shear rate is lowered [ see also fig .  [",
    "fig : sigmapeak ] ] .",
    "note also that all curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : stress - strain::gammadot_effect ] show the same elastic response at small strains .",
    "as also shown in the figure , a linear fit to @xmath96 with a shear modulus of @xmath83 describes well the data at small deformations .    in order to understand the rather strong deviation from linearity at small strains in the case of @xmath97 , we recall that , once the ( left ) wall starts its motion , a time of approximately @xmath98 must elapse before the deformation field comprises the whole system .",
    "this is nicely borne out in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : short - time - xcm_profile ] where , for a wall velocity of @xmath99 , `` snap shots '' of the layer resolved displacement of center of mass ( normalized to the displacement of the wall ) are shown for @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "indeed , the boundary of the deformed region reaches the immobile wall only after @xmath102 lj time units .",
    "we have verified this behavior for other wall velocities and have found @xmath103 in all cases . however , as shown in the main part of fig .",
    "[ fig : short - time - xcm_profile ] , at higher wall velocities , the deformation field is no longer linear at the time it reaches the immobile wall .",
    "this can be rationalized as follows .",
    "the total strain at @xmath104 is given by @xmath105 yielding @xmath106 for @xmath107 .",
    "hence , the elastic regime is left already before the whole system is affected by the motion of the wall .",
    "putting it the other way , one can estimate the time for which a _ locally _ elastic response can still be observed at a given wall velocity : @xmath108 . assuming an elastic response at a strain of a few percent one obtains for @xmath109 a time of a few lennard - jones units at @xmath97",
    "[ see the stars in the inset of fig .",

    "the dependence of @xmath66 on @xmath14 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmapeak ] for temperatures of @xmath12 and @xmath110 . for the lower temperature",
    ", data are shown for two system sizes @xmath111 ( averaged over 10 independent runs ) and @xmath112 ( a sole run ) .",
    "as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmapeak ] , for both system sizes , results on @xmath66 are practically identical .",
    "note that the computation of @xmath66 at @xmath113 for the large system required about 25 days of simulation on a 1.8ghz amd - athlon cpu .",
    "the data point corresponding to @xmath114 has therefore been computed using the average over many small systems only .",
    "as the results are not sensitive to the system size , we have used the smaller system size also in the case of @xmath110 ( again averaging over @xmath115 independent runs ) .    for @xmath12 ,",
    "a change in the slope of @xmath66-@xmath14-curve is observed at a shear rate of approximately @xmath116 . at shear rates smaller than @xmath117",
    ", the system seems to have enough time for a partial release of the stress through rearrangements of particles .",
    "note that the stress overshoot @xmath66 is observed at strains smaller than @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , small rearrangements are sufficient in order to release the stress considerably .",
    "indeed , an investigation of the mean squared displacement shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : msd_aging ] reveals that the msd departs from the plateau for @xmath119 .",
    "this time is of the same order as the inverse of the cross over shear rate thus suggesting that the cross over in the @xmath14-dependence of @xmath66 is related to the beginning of the cage relaxation .",
    "while at higher overall shear rates the response of the system is dominated by the ( shorter ) time scale imposed by the shear motion , it is no longer the case at @xmath120 , where the inherent system dynamics come into play .",
    "although not so pronounced , a similar cross over is seen also in the case of @xmath110 at a larger shear rate in agreement with the observation that , compared to @xmath12 , the msd at @xmath110 leaves the plateau at a shorter time [ see the msd(@xmath110 ) in fig .",
    "[ msd_y_tw900000_allt ] ] .",
    "note that , as the structural relaxation time is approximately proportional to the age of the system @xcite , @xmath121 is of the order of @xmath59 .",
    "the system response below the crossover is in fact a complex combination of aging dynamics and stress induced relaxation .",
    "the aging dynamics tends to make the system stiffer ( see below ) , so that the observed @xmath66 is higher than the value one would extrapolate from high shear rates .",
    "the dependence of the stress overshoot @xmath66 on the imposed shear rate is often expressed with a simple formula which goes back to the ree - eyring s viscosity theory  @xcite , @xmath122 here , the _ activation volume _",
    ", @xmath123 , is interpreted as the characteristic volume of a region involved in an elementary shear motion ( hopping ) and @xmath124 is the attempt frequency of hopping .",

    "this result is comparable to the estimates of the free volume from experiments on polycarbonate , where a value of @xmath128 per segment is reported  @xcite .",
    "ho huu and vu - khanh  @xcite have extensively studied the effects of physical aging and strain rate on yielding kinetics of polycarbonate(pc ) for temperatures ranging from @xmath129 to @xmath130 [ note that @xmath131 . in particular , they have measured the tensile stress at yield point , @xmath132 , as a function of strain rate , @xmath133 , for various temperatures and different ages of the sample . as for the effect of temperature ,",
    "they find that the slope of @xmath134 ( i.e. the activation volume ) is practically independent of @xmath52 .",

    "( [ eq : eyring ] ) is expected to hold better .",
    "the above qualitative agreement on the strain rate dependence of the stress at yield point for our molecular model glass and polycarbonate suggests that , for strains smaller than , say @xmath136 , the relevant length scale is that of a segment .",

    "enhance the repulsive ( and therefore athermal ) character of the system simulated by rottler and robbins compared to our model .",
    "this also explains why the shear banding is observed at a temperature as low as @xmath143 in  @xcite , whereas we observe it at @xmath12 and even higher temperatures  @xcite .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the uniaxial strain in ref .",
    "@xcite was imposed by a simple instantaneous rescaling of the box dimension and the positions of all particles , whereas in our case a more realistic situation is considered : the shear strain in the fluid is induced through interactions with a moving atomistic wall .",

    "[ fig : stress - strain::gammadot_effect ] reveals , the difference between the peak and the steady state stresses decreases as @xmath14 is reduced thus suggesting that , in the limit of vanishing shear rate , @xmath66 converges towards the steady state stress ( and therefore coincides with the yield stress that could be extracted from homogeneous flow experiments ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : sigmapeak+steady ] compares these two quantities , underlining this expectation further .",

    "this clearly illustrates the presence of attractive forces which , now , are stronger than the imposed stress and thus capable of reducing the amount of strain .",
    "indeed , an inspection of the center of mass position of the wall and of the fluid shows that both these quantities exhibit a maximum at the place where the velocity passed through zero ( as the stress is further reduced , @xmath172 decreases in accordance with the observation of a negative velocity ) .",
    "very similar observations are also reported on the experimental side  @xcite .",
    "as discussed in section  [ section : introduction ] , there seems to be a close connection between the existence of a yield stress and the observation of the shear banding phenomenon in many soft glassy materials  @xcite . in particular , it is commonly expected that , in a state where the yield stress vanishes ( at high temperatures , for example ) the shear bands should also disappear , i.e. the whole system should flow .",
    "in addition to this experimental aspect , a study of the yield stress is also motivated from the theoretical point of view .",
    "for example , the so called soft glassy rheology model ( sgr ) of sollich  @xcite ( an extension of the trap model  @xcite taking into account yielding effects due to an external flow ) predicts a linear onset of the dynamic yield stress as the glass transition is approached , @xmath173 .",
    "here , @xmath53 is a noise temperature , @xmath174 corresponds to the glass transition ( or `` jamming '' ) temperature , and @xmath175 characterizes the glassy or `` jammed '' phase . on the other hand , numerical studies of a @xmath176-spin mean field hamiltonian  @xcite predict that the dynamic yield stress vanishes at all temperatures .",
    "there has recently been a more microscopic approach based on an extension to non equilibrium situation  @xcite of the mode coupling theory of the glass transition ( mct )  @xcite .",
    "an analysis of schematic models within this approach shows a rather discontinuous change in the dynamic yield stress at the mode coupling critical temperature , @xmath4 .",
    "the reader may have noticed that the above mentioned theories make predictions on the _ dynamic _ yield stress [ defined as @xmath177 .",
    "our interpretation of the shear banding , however , makes use of the idea of resistance to an applied stress which is related to the presence of a _",
    "static _ yield stress .",
    "similar to the difference between the dynamic and static friction  @xcite , the static and the dynamic yield stresses are not necessarily identical .",
    "indeed , for our model glass , we find that @xmath178 [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig3 ] ] .",
    "therefore , a measurement of the static yield stress gives at least an upper bound for the dynamic counterpart .",
    "as we will see below , the static yield stress decreases rather sharply as the mode coupling critical temperature of the model ( @xmath3 ) is approached .",
    "unfortunately , when measuring @xmath2 at temperatures close to @xmath4 , one is faced with the problem that the time scale imposed by the external force ( which if of order of the inverse stress variation rate , i.e. @xmath179 ) and that of the ( inherent ) structural relaxation , @xmath180 , are not well separated . in particular , the condition @xmath181 is not valid at temperatures close to @xmath4 . therefore , as will be discussed below in more details , a conclusive statement on the interesting limit of @xmath182 can still not be made .",
    "preliminary results on the static yield stress have been recently obtained within the driven mean field @xmath176-spin models  @xcite .",
    "using the fact that the free energy barriers are finite at finite system size , the model has been investigated by monte carlo simulations in the case of @xmath183 for a finite number of spins , thus allowing the thermal activations to play a role which they could not play in the case of an infinite system size .",

    "results based on this new approach on the temperature dependence of the yield stress and , in particular , on its behavior close to @xmath4 are , however , lacking at the moment .    here",
    ", we adopt a method very close to a determination of the ( static ) yield stress in experiments , i.e. we use the definition of @xmath2 as the smallest stress at which a flow in the system is observed . as we are interested in a study of the temperature dependence of @xmath2 and , in particular , in @xmath184 close to the mode coupling critical temperature , we have varied the temperature in the range of @xmath185 $ ] ( recall that @xmath3 ) .",
    "for each temperature , @xmath1 was increased stepwise by an amount of @xmath186 once in each @xmath187 lj time units during which the velocity profile corresponding to the imposed stress is measured . among other quantities ,",
    "we also monitor the motion of the center of mass of the wall and also of the fluid itself .",
    "note that the overall stress increase rate in these simulations is @xmath188 , and thus corresponds to a quasi static variation of the stress [ see the discussion of figs .",
    "[ fig : epot_versus_t_3rates ] and  [ fig : vcm_average_all_rates_inc+dec+5e-6 ] ] .",
    "for each temperature , the simulation was performed using 10 independent initial configurations .",
    "recall that there is always an elastic contribution to the system response to an applied stress .",
    "the corresponding center of mass velocity can simply be estimated as @xmath189 .",
    "this contribution is negligible at lower @xmath52 for two reasons : ( i ) due to the high stiffness of the system ( large @xmath81 ) , @xmath190 is relatively small and ( ii ) the onset of the shear motion is quite sharp at low @xmath52 thus leading to much higher velocities ( compared to @xmath190 ) as soon as the applied stress exceeds @xmath2 . in contrast , close to @xmath4 , the shear modulus is quite small [ see , for example , the slope of the stress - strain curve at @xmath154 in fig .",
    "[ fig : stress - strain::t_effect ] ] thus leading to a larger @xmath190 .",
    "furthermore , there is no sharp variation in @xmath191 as a function of applied stress . for a measurement of @xmath2 close to @xmath4 ,",
    "it is therefore important to correct for the elastic contribution to the system response . for this purpose",
    ", we have determined the @xmath52-dependence of the shear modulus .",

    "[ fig : vcm_average_all_rates2e-5_inc_allt ] suggests , this method is not expected to give accurate results for @xmath2 at high temperatures ( @xmath194 , say ) .",
    "a slightly different approach in determining @xmath2 is to find the smallest stress for which the center of mass velocity exceeds a certain , small value , @xmath195 . here",
    ", we further require that @xmath191 must _ remain _ larger than @xmath195 for all subsequent stresses .",
    "this last condition serves to reduce errors due to fluctuations of @xmath191 . in applying this definition ,",
    "we use the result of each independent run on @xmath191 separately and thus obtain , for each @xmath195 , a set of yield stress values .",
    "this allows an estimate of the statistical error .",
    "figure  [ fig : yield_stress_versus_t ] compares the yield stress obtained via the linear fit to @xmath191 with results of the second approach for @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "not unexpectedly , it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : yield_stress_versus_t ] that the quality of results on @xmath2 strongly depends on temperature . at temperature",

    "therefore , result on @xmath2 at temperatures close to @xmath4 should be considered as rough estimates only .",
    "the origin of the difficulty in estimating the static yield stress of the system at temperatures close to @xmath4 , can be understood by comparing the time scales relevant to the problem .",
    "first , there is a time scale related to the imposed stress @xmath202 .",
    "the second relevant time scale is that of the structural relaxation , @xmath180 .",
    "the static yield stress is well defined in the limit of a quasi static variation of stress , i.e. @xmath203 ( @xmath204 ) while at the same time keeping @xmath205 .",
    "using @xmath206 and @xmath207 ( note that this value of @xmath163 was used at all temperatures in order to determine the yield stress ) we obtain @xmath208 .",
    "we are therefore led to verify if the condition @xmath209 is satisfied at all temperatures . for this purpose ,",
    "we define @xmath180 as the time needed by the mean square displacement of a tagged particle to reach the particle size .",
    "figure  [ msd_y_tw900000_allt ] shows the mean square displacement of the _ unsheared _ system for @xmath185 $ ] ( recall that @xmath3 ) . for all these temperatures , the waiting time between the temperature quench ( from an initial temperature of @xmath38 to the actual temperature ) and the beginning of the measurement was @xmath210 . at low temperatures ,",
    "the msd practically remains on a plateau for the whole duration of the simulation indicating that @xmath180 is much larger than the simulated time of @xmath211 lj time units . at higher temperatures ( @xmath212 ) , however , after a long plateau , the msd eventually enters the diffusive regime and reaches a value comparable to unity within the simulated time window .",
    "obviously the condition @xmath205 is violated at these temperatures .",
    "hence at least for a waiting time of @xmath213 and for the choice of @xmath188 , the computed static yield stress is not well defined close to @xmath4 .",
    "results on the yield behavior of a model glass ( a 80:20 binary lennard - jones mixtures  @xcite ) , studied by means of molecular dynamics simulations , have been reported .",
    "one of the major motivations of the present work is the observation of shear localization ( below the glass transition temperature and at low shear rates ) in the present model and the suggestion of a link between this phenomenon and the existence of a static yield stress  @xcite ( under applied stress , the system does not flow until the stress exceeds a threshold value ) .",
    "a particular emphasis thus lies on the yield stress and its dependence on temperature .",
    "first , the system stress - strain curve under startup of steady shear has been studied .",
    "the effect of physical aging ( characterized by the waiting time , @xmath59 ) , shear rate ( @xmath14 ) , and temperature on the stress - strain relation has been investigated .",
    "regardless of these parameteres , all observed stress - strain curves first exhibit an elastic regime at small shear deformations ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "the stress then increases up to a maximum , @xmath66 , before decreasing towards the steady state stress at large deformations . the steady state stress ( corresponding to large deformations ) shows a dependence on temperature and on the applied shear rate , but is independent of the system history , indicating a recovery of the time translation invariance due to shear induced structural relaxation  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the stress overshoot @xmath66 , ( the first maximum of the stress - strain curves , spmetimes described as a dynamical yield stress ) depends on the imposed shear rate and on the waiting time ( physical aging ) . it is observed that , at relatively high shear rates or for large waiting times , the maximum stress increases with @xmath214 or with @xmath215 , respectively .",
    "these observations are consistent with experiments on amorphous polymers  @xcite and on metallic glasses  @xcite , and also correspond to the behaviour predicted using the soft glassy rheology model @xcite .",
    "for shear rates below a certain , cross over shear rate , @xmath117 , however , a decrease in the slope of @xmath66-@xmath14 curve is seen . a comparison with the steady state shear stress suggests that @xmath66 saturates at the steady state stress level as the imposed shear rate approaches zero .",
    "moreover , an analysis of the mean square displacements of the unsheared system reveals that the cross over shear rate , @xmath117 , is very close to @xmath216 , where @xmath121 marks the time for which the mean square displacement gradually departs from the plateau - regime [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : msd_aging ] ] .",
    "we therefore associate this crossover with the beginning of the cage relaxation , which leads to the possibility of small ( compared to the size of a particle ) rearrangements thus allowing at least a partial release of the stress .",
    "@xmath217 is also comparable to the inverse of the waiting time : for @xmath218 , the response of the system is directly influenced by the aging dynamics .    in order to build a closer connection between our studies and typical rheological experiments ,",
    "stress ramp simulations are performed and the system response is analyzed for stress increase rates ranging from @xmath219 to @xmath220 . in agreement with experiments on complex systems like pastes , dense colloidal suspensions  @xcite and foams  @xcite , hysteresis loops in the system response are observed .",
    "these loops become wider as @xmath163 increases .",
    "an analysis of the potential energy per particle for different @xmath163 nicely shows how high energy configurations are favored by the faster stress variations .",
    "this also yields an estimate of quasi static stress application . we find that , for our model",
    ", @xmath188 is slow enough so that simulations with this stress variation rate can be used in order to obtain a reliable estimate of the static yield stress .",
    "finally , the static yield stress , @xmath2 , is determined and its reliability is discussed .",
    "our numerical results confirm the observation of reference @xcite , that the static yield stress is higher than the low shear rate limit @xmath221 observed in steady shear experiments",
    ". the system can therefore produce shear bands for stresses in the range [ @xmath221,@xmath2 ] .    at temperatures far below the mode coupling critical temperature of the model ( @xmath3 ) , a slight increase of @xmath2 with further cooling",
    "is observed . at temperatures close to @xmath4 ,",
    "however , the static yield stress strongly decreases as @xmath52 is increased towards @xmath4 . as to the reliability of the data , relatively accurate estimate of @xmath2 is obtained at low temperatures ( for @xmath192 ) .",
    "results on the yield stress at temperatures close to @xmath4 , however , are very sensitive to the applied criterion .",
    "an investigation of the dynamics of the unperturbed system reveals that , for @xmath52 close to @xmath4 , the structural relaxation times are far from being large compared to the time scale imposed by the external force ( the inverse of the stress increase rate , @xmath223 ) .",
    "therefore , for the simulated waiting time of @xmath224 , the static yield stress is no longer well defined at these high temperatures .",
    "this underlines the fact that a very good separation of time scales between the experimental and intrinsic time scales is necessary in order to properly define a static yield stress .",
    "it must , however , be emphasized that , even though an increase of @xmath163 apparently leads to a validity of @xmath205 , this would violate the condition of a quasi static variation of the stress . a more physical way to improve",
    "the accuracy of results on @xmath2 is to increase the waiting time , in order to allow @xmath180 to grow beyond @xmath225 .",
    "noting that , at higher temperatures ( but still below @xmath4 ) , @xmath180 increases less strongly with @xmath59 ( interrupted aging ) , the limit of large @xmath180 becomes progressively more time consuming in terms of computation time .",
    "our numerical study shows that a very simple model , studied numerically on relatively short time scales , can exhibit most of the complex rheological behaviour of soft glassy systems , but also of  hard  ( metallic ) glasses ( it is interesting in this respect to note that the simulated system was originally intended to mimic a nipd metallic glass ) .",

    "if there is no such region , the yield stress is necessarily _ smaller _ than the steady state stress at the imposed shear rate .",
    "this , however , is impossible , for the startup of the shear motion in response to an imposed stress leads to at least a partial release of the stress .              note that , by choosing a smaller integration time step and applying the rescaling procedure more frequently , one can increase the effective thermostating rate .",
    "however , a thermostating rate larger than @xmath229 , ( @xmath230 is the decay time of the velocity auto correlation function ) does not make much sense as the heat transferred to the @xmath53-component of the particle velocities must be first dissipated to the other directions before it can be removed by a rescaling of , say @xmath54-component of the particle velocities .",

    "<S> the stress - strain relations and the yield behavior of a model glass ( a 80:20 binary lennard - jones mixtures  @xcite ) is studied by means of molecular dynamics simulations . in a previous paper  @xcite it </S>",
    "<S> was shown that , at temperatures _ below _ the glass transition temperature , @xmath0 , the model exhibits shear banding under imposed shear . </S>",
    "<S> it was also suggested that this behavior is closely related to the existence of a ( static ) yield stress ( under applied stress , the system does not flow until the stress @xmath1 exceeds a threshold value @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a thorough analysis of the static yield stress is presented via simulations under imposed stress . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , using steady shear simulations , the effect of physical aging , shear rate and temperature on the stress - strain relation is investigated . in particular , we find that the stress at the yield point ( the `` peak''-value of the stress - strain curve ) exhibits a logarithmic dependence both on the imposed shear rate and on the `` age '' of the system in qualitative agreement with experiments on amorphous polymers  @xcite and on metallic glasses  @xcite . in addition to the very observation of the yield stress which is an important feature seen in experiments on complex systems like pastes , dense colloidal suspensions  @xcite and foams  @xcite , further links between our model and soft glassy materials are found . </S>",
    "<S> an example are hysteresis loops in the system response to a varying imposed stress . finally , we measure the static yield stress for our model and study its dependence on temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for temperatures far below the mode coupling critical temperature of the model ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath2 decreases slowly upon heating followed by a stronger decrease as @xmath4 is approached . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the reliability of results on the static yield stress and give a criterion for its validity in terms of the time scales relevant to the problem . </S>"
