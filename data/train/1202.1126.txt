    "in a variety of emerging applications , there is a need for secure transmission over optical links . in such settings , a natural approach to providing security against computationally - unbounded attacks is to exploit the physical layer , and the corresponding natural information theoretic model for analysis is the basic bosonic wiretap channel . in practice , a variety of regimes are of interest .",
    "while for optical links photon efficiency ( b / photon ) has tended to be of greater importance than spectral efficiency ( b / s / hz ) , there is growing interest in the latter as well . when the photon and spectral efficiency requirements are simultaneously high , multiple spatial modes are required @xcite .",
    "accordingly there is a need to more fully understand the capacity of both single - mode and multiple - mode bosonic wiretap channels in such regimes .",
    "moreover , in practice , free - space propagation is strongly affected by turbulence , the effect of which on private capacity is also not yet well understood .",
    "optical communication at many bits / photon is possible with bandwidth expansion , and at many bits / sec - hz with bandwidth - efficient signaling , but both such efficiencies can not be achieved in single spatial - mode operation .",
    "previous work for the vacuum - propagation channel has shown that 10 bits / photon capacity at 5 bits / sec - hz over a vacuum - propagation channel requires 189 low - loss spatial modes at the holevo capacity , and 4500 modes at the capacity limit for on - off keying modulation with a direct - detection receiver @xcite , with neither heterodyne nor homodyne detection reaching that photon - efficiency goal .",
    "vacuum propagation does not preclude an eavesdropper s detecting part of the transmitted light beam , so it is of interest to determine the private capacity when high photon efficiency and high spectral efficiency are both required .",
    "furthermore , because terrestrial free - space optical links suffer the random effects of refractive - index turbulence , the private capacity should be considered for such conditions .    in this paper , we first prove an upper bound on the private capacity of the single - mode bosonic wiretap channel . combining our upper bound with the previously - derived lower bound @xcite , we obtain the single - mode private capacity s low photon - number asymptotic behavior .",
    "we then treat the multiple - mode bosonic wiretap channel , obtaining results that tightly bracket the private capacity when both high photon efficiency and high spectral efficiency are required .",
    "finally , we exploit convexity and majorization to obtain a lower bound on the multiple - spatial - mode private capacity for the turbulent channel that only requires second moments of the channel matrix , and thus may be tight for near - field operation in which both high photon efficiency and high spectral efficiency are obtained .",
    "we use a lower - case letter like @xmath0 to denote a number , and an upper - case letter like @xmath1 to denote a random variable ( except for some special cases , e.g. , @xmath2 denotes the capacity ) .",
    "we use a boldface lower - case letter like @xmath3 or @xmath4 to denote a vector , and a boldface upper - case letter like @xmath5 or @xmath6 to denote a random vector .",
    "we use a font like @xmath7 to denote a matrix , and a corresponding upper - case letter like @xmath8 to denote a random matrix .",
    "finally , we use a font like @xmath9 to denote a hilbert space , a font like @xmath10 to denote the annihilation operator on @xmath9 , and @xmath11 to denote a density operator on @xmath9 .",
    "all logarithms in this paper are natural logarithms , and information is measured in nats unless stated otherwise .",
    "let @xmath10 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 denote the annihilation operators on the hilbert spaces of alice , bob , and eve , respectively .",
    "the single - mode noiseless bosonic wiretap channel can be described in the heisenberg picture by the beam splitter relation    [ eq : singlemode ]    rcl & = & + , + & = & - ,    where @xmath14 $ ] , and where @xmath15 is the annihilation operator of the noise mode , which we assume to be in its vacuum state .",
    "note that this is a _",
    "worst - case _ model in the sense that we assume eve can obtain all photons that do not reach bob .",
    "we impose an average - photon - number constraint on the input @xmath16 where the expectation is averaged over all codewords .",
    "denote the classical private capacity of the channel under constraint by @xmath17 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that @xmath18 with @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the maximum entropy of a single - mode bosonic state whose expected photon - number equals @xmath0 , achieved by the _ thermal state _ : @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the number state containing @xmath23 photons .",
    "it is conjectured in @xcite that holds with equality , as a consequence of the conjectured `` entropy photon - number inequality '' .",
    "as @xmath24 tends to infinity , the lower bound is tight and agrees with the private - capacity formula derived in @xcite : @xmath25      [ thm : single ] the classical private capacity @xmath17 is bounded by @xmath27 where @xmath28    before proving theorem  [ thm : single ] , we first prove a simple lemma which says that @xmath26 is monotonic in @xmath29 .",
    "[ lem : monotonicity ] for any @xmath30 and any @xmath31 , @xmath32    let @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote the output hilbert spaces of bob and eve , respectively , of the channel with transmissivity ( from alice to bob ) @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "observe that @xmath37 is stochastically degraded from @xmath38 . indeed , when we pass the state on @xmath38 through a beam splitter of transmissivity @xmath39 , we obtain a state that is identical to the one on @xmath37 . therefore , a bob having access to @xmath38 can always pass his state through this beam splitter and then make the same measurement as a bob having access to @xmath37 , thus he can do _ at least _ as well as the latter .",
    "similarly , @xmath40 is stochastically degraded from @xmath41 , and an eve having access to @xmath40 can do _ at most _ as well as an eve having access to @xmath41 .",
