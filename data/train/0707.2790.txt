    "the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) is one of the cornerstones in our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution . since the introduction of a fitting function for its shape by @xcite ,",
    "the origin of the form of the lf function has been a powerful constraint on model building ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while recent work has focused somewhat on the luminous end , its evolution with redshift @xcite and the role of dry mergers @xcite , the faint - end provides additional important clues on galaxy formation .",
    "systematic studies of the faint - end slope in the local universe reveal differences between high and low density environments @xcite , as well as for galaxy samples split by morphologies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the underlying physical processes that shape the faint - end of the lf are generally associated with feedback from supernovae that is effective in heating gas and driving winds in shallow gravitational potentials @xcite . although the implementation of supernova feedback in galaxy formation models has been extensively investigated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the local galaxy lf , its impact on the redshift evolution on the faint - end has not been as well studied .",
    "the recent wealth of lf measured to very faint magnitudes in the rest - frame b - band and the rest - frame fuv ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) allows us to test models with high accuracy .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to investigate the underlying driving mechanism for the redshift evolution of the faint - end slope .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the impact of supernova feedback on the rate of star - formation by varying the relevant efficiency parameters .",
    "in the following we briefly outline our basic modelling approach and refer the reader for more details to @xcite , @xcite and reference therein . we generate merger trees for dark matter halos using a monte - carlo approach based on the extended press - schechter formalism @xcite . as we aim to model the faint - end of the lf to high redshifts , we need to make sure that the mass resolution in our simulations is sufficient .",
    "we generate merger trees from dark matter mass functions between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and find that resolving each individual merger tree down to a mass resolution of @xmath14 m@xmath15 and @xmath16 m@xmath15 at @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , gives robust results .",
    "once a tree reaches @xmath19 , we start moving the tree forward in time including physical processes associated with the baryons within each dark matter halo that include gas cooling , star - formation , supernova feedback , reionization and merging of galaxies on a dynamical friction time - scale . as the focus of this letter is on the faint - end of the luminosity function",
    ", we will omit including prescriptions for agn - feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or environmental effects @xcite that mainly influence the bright - end of the luminosity function .",
    "the largest impact on the slope at the faint - end comes from star - formation and associated supernova feedback @xcite .",
    "faint galaxies generally occupy small dark matter halos with shallow potential wells , that allow effective reheating of cold gas in the ism by feedback from supernovae .",
    "we model star - formation in galaxies using a parametrisation of the global schmidt - kennicutt - law @xcite according to which @xmath20 , where @xmath10 is a free parameter that is indicative of the efficiency of star - formation , @xmath21 is the mass in cold gas in the galactic disk , and @xmath22 is the dynamical time - scale of the galaxy . following the arguments by @xcite ,",
    "we model the amount of cold gas reheated by feedback from supernovae with @xmath23 , with @xmath11 as a free parameter that controls the feedback efficiency , @xmath24 the number of supernovae per solar mass of stars formed , @xmath25 erg is the energy released by each supernova , and @xmath26 is the maximum circular velocity of the dark matter halo in which the galaxy resides .    for each individual galaxy in our simulation , we store the star - formation history and generate its @xmath27band and fuv rest - frame luminosity function at various redshifts using the stellar population models of @xcite . the faint - end of the luminosity function is then fitted by a simple power law with slope @xmath0 as defined in @xcite .",
    "we fit the faint - end lf at each redshift with a power law spanning a range of four magnitudes at z @xmath28 and at least two magnitudes at @xmath29 , starting at the lowest magnitude @xmath30 that is unaffected by the mass resolution of the simulation .",
    "we choose this approach over fitting the whole lf with a schechter - fit , because we are missing physical effects ( see below ) in our model that are responsible for shaping the bright - end and the knee of the lf .",
    "in addition , we increase the number of magnitude bins and make sure that the fitted values for @xmath0 are unaffected by the bin - size .",
    "fig.1 shows the luminosity function at magnitudes larger than the corresponding minimum magnitude for @xmath31 . in this study",
    ", we simulate a volume of @xmath32 mpc@xmath33 , which allows us to calculate @xmath0 robustly up to a redshift @xmath34 .    throughout this paper , we use the following set of cosmological parameters based on the three year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe data @xcite : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "there is significant evidence that the faint - end slope of the galaxy luminosity function shows a measurable dependence on redshift , which can be fitted by a linear law of the form @xmath40 , with @xmath41 between @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and @xmath44 between @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( for recent observations , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . within the hierarchical structure formation paradigm ,",
    "one naturally expects such behaviour , considering that the slope of the dark matter mass function below m@xmath47 is @xmath48 and that the objects that form in these halos continue to grow by continued star - formation and mergers with each other @xcite , hence flattening the slope .",
    "1 shows the predicted model luminosity function at various redshifts in the rest - frame @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the simulated and observed luminosity functions are in fair agreement at the faint - end .",
    "the luminous end however , shows deviations at low redshift which are due to missing feedback sources in massive galaxies such as agn or to environmental effects . in fig .",
    "2 , we show the predicted evolution of @xmath51 for our best - fit local model . the free parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 in this model are chosen to give the best fit to various local observations ( see * ?",
    "* ) . for consistency with the majority of observations ,",
    "we calculate the faint - end slope for the rest - frame fuv at @xmath18 and at lower redshifts for the rest - frame @xmath49-band .",
    "we indeed find an evolution in @xmath0 with redshift that is in fair agreement with the observed evolution .",
    "the immediate question that arises is , what influences and is the main driver for the evolution in @xmath0 ? generally , supernova feedback is considered the dominant mechanism in shaping the faint - end of the luminosity function @xcite .",
    "the shaded region in fig .",
    "2 shows the range of linear fits to @xmath5 that we find by varying the star - formation efficiency between @xmath52 and the supernovae feedback efficiency between @xmath53 .",
    "we infer only a very modest change in @xmath5 for reasonable choices of feedback efficiencies , and therefore conclude that another process must be responsible for the observed evolution in @xmath5 .",
    "the mass function of dark matter halos is known to show a strong evolution with redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the galaxies contributing to the luminosity function around @xmath4 are mostly central galaxies in their dark matter halos , i.e. the most luminous galaxy within the halo ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is therefore not unreasonable to assume a connection between the evolution of @xmath5 and that of the dark matter mass function . when considering the luminosity of central galaxies residing in dark matter halos of the same mass at different redshifts",
    ", we find that at early times , central galaxies are up to three magnitudes brighter than their counterparts in low redshift halos .",
    "this is even the case for halos hosting sub-@xmath4 galaxies .",
    "similar results have been reported by @xcite , who showed that dwarf galaxies at early times are not affected by supernova feedback in their simulations because cooling times are very short in these halos and the energy injected by the supernovae is rapidly dissipated away .",
    "the slope in the region of dark matter halos that host sub-@xmath4 galaxies is steeper at high redshift , and consequently so is @xmath0 .",
    "the same is true for other choices of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , thereby explaining why we do not find any strong dependence of @xmath5 on these parameters .",
    "it should be noted however , that modelling these parameters with a strong redshift dependency will be able to enhance or weaken the evolution of @xmath0    [ fig1 ]    we continue analyzing the evolution in @xmath5 by distinguishing between cluster and field galaxies and their relaxation to the overall luminosity function at the faint - end . in fig .",
    "3 , we present @xmath5 for progenitor galaxies of present - day cluster and field galaxies from our simulations . here",
    "we define cluster environments by present - day dark matter halos above @xmath54 m@xmath15 , and field environments by halos with masses below @xmath55 m@xmath15 . in field environments",
    "@xmath56 is steeper and evolves more strongly than in cluster environments . at early times , the first galaxies to appear are most likely in high@xmath57 fluctuations , which will result in present - day galaxy clusters .",
    "consequently , the faint - end luminosity function at high redshifts will be dominated by present - day cluster members , and the faint - end - slope of the overall galaxy population at high redshifts is flatter than that for the field luminosity function alone at the same redshift . when considering the relative weight of field galaxies to the overall galaxy population at the faint - end , one can estimate the redshift at which the transition from cluster - driven to field - driven evolution in @xmath0 occurs . we find that this transition roughly occurs at @xmath8 with a slight dependency on the definition of environment .",
    "in this letter , we presented predictions for the redshift evolution of the faint - end slope of the luminosity function within the @xmath58cdm - scenario . in general , we find the same trend as in the recent observations i.e. , a steepening faint - end slope @xmath0 with redshift , which can be well - fitted by a simple linear fit @xmath59 where the observations find @xmath60 and @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "our simulations predict @xmath62 and @xmath63 , in good agreement with the observations considering the large uncertainties , especially at high redshifts .",
    "our simulations confirm previous results that the flattening of the faint - end slope @xmath0 with respect to the slope in the dark matter mass function can be well explained by supernova feedback .",
    "however we additionally show that @xmath0 is steeper at higher redshifts mainly , due to the dark matter mass function being steeper for the range of halo masses that host sub-@xmath4 galaxies , suggesting that the evolution of @xmath0 traces closely that of the underlying dark matter mass function .",
    "the contribution of the progenitor population of present - day field and cluster galaxies plays a significant role in shaping the evolution of @xmath0 . for field galaxies ,",
    "the evolution of @xmath5 is stronger , with @xmath6 and @xmath64 than for cluster galaxies . in our simulations",
    ", we find that at redshifts @xmath65 , the faint - end is dominated by galaxies ending up in present - day clusters .",
    "this transition redshift is dependent on the value of @xmath66 , which normalizes the power spectrum and regulates the redshift at which structures of a given mass typically form .",
    "additionally , the slope of the fluctuation spectrum at small scales will influence @xmath67 .",
    "precise high redshift measurements of the contributions of these two populations to the faint - end of the luminosity function in future surveys with e.g. the hst wfc3 will help to pin down @xmath67 .",
    "one potential problem for future surveys will be a possible bias towards cluster galaxies as they might experience induced star - formation @xcite , increasing their surface brightness and making them more easily detectable .",
    "this effect will shift @xmath67 to higher redshifts and needs to be taken into account carefully .",
    "observational selection effects will affect the observed faint - end lf - slope in fig .",
    "some observational selection effects ( i.e. catalogue incompleteness and natural confusion , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can make the observed faint - end slope flatter than the true one , while others ( e.g. , sb - dimming ) could make the observed slope somewhat steeper than the true one , depending on the exact intrinsic object size distribution .",
    "a number of groups correct for incompleteness either through mc - simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or through cloning techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and find similar faint - end slopes when following different procedures .",
    "when judging the data , however , one must keep these observational biases in mind . ultimately , these issues can only be resolved with deeper jwst data to ab=31 - 32 mag .",
    "tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies in clusters as seen in high resolution simulations @xcite can in principle change the slope @xmath0 .",
    "our results , however , suggest that at a transition redshift of @xmath68 , the evolution of @xmath0 changes from being dominated by cluster galaxies to being dominated by field galaxies .",
    "it is therefore not likely that a large amount of the evolution in @xmath0 at @xmath69 is driven by tidal disruption of faint galaxies .",
    "an additional implication from the transition at @xmath67 is that the evolution of @xmath5 is better fit by a linear function with a break at @xmath67 .",
    "the flattening of the slope @xmath0 with respect to the underlying dark matter slope suggests the interesting possibility of estimating the time - scale over which supernovae operate .",
    "assuming that the first pop ii stars were formed sometime before reionization @xcite , and that supernovae type ia originate roughly @xmath70 gyr after the bulk of the first pop ii star - formation , one would expect an increase in energy injection into the interstellar medium at a redshift corresponding to this time lag .",
    "this additional energy input will hinder star - formation and contribute to a further increase in the mass - to - light ratio of galaxies and hence to an even stronger flattening of the slope @xmath0 .",
    "it will be crucial to have robust measurements of @xmath0 over a wide range of redshifts to probe the onset of the first significant feedback contribution from type ia supernovae .",
    "furthermore , probing the faint - end slope at redshifts @xmath71 , before the significant onset of type ii supernovae will allow us to measure the underlying dark matter slope very accurately .",
    "our approach has certain shortcomings .",
    "the model presented here did not include any time delay prescriptions for the various sn types , but instead assumed instantaneous feedback .",
    "more detailed modeling of the time delays and its influence on the faint - end slope will be presented elsewhere ( in preparation ) .",
    "our treatment of supernovae feedback is very simplistic , and more detailed hydrodynamical simulations including a multi - phase medium will show if this general trend which we report can be recovered .",
    "first generations of such simulations indeed show that sn type ii that are generated in dense star clusters explode into bubbles of hot gas and are therefore less efficient at feedback into the ism @xcite compared to sn type ia , which go off at random places in the galaxy and , can have more effect on the early ism .",
