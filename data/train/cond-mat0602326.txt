    "the emergence of similarities between the properties of molecular glasses , dense colloidal suspensions , foams , and granular materials , have led to the notion of jamming @xcite - the transition between solid - like and fluid - like phases in disordered systems - as a manner through which one can gain a deeper understanding of the traditional liquid - glass transition and the fascinating , complex phenomena observed in amorphous materials in general @xcite .",
    "although there has recently been some works highlighting the differences between the onset of rigidity in jammed matter and glassiness @xcite , the emphasis in this work is on the commonalities between the two @xcite . here",

    "jamming transition , the structure factor , @xmath3 , exhibits a linear dependence on wavenumber @xmath4 , @xmath5 this behavior of @xmath3 suggests that the total correlation function @xmath6 , decays as @xmath7 , at large separations @xmath8 , as deduced from the asymptotic estimates of fourier transforms @xcite .",
    "similarly it suggests a long range behavior for the direct correlation function @xmath9 .",
    "this is indeed in contrast to standard liquid state theory for liquids whose constituents interact via a finite range potential - hence @xmath9 is short ranged - which predicts , @xmath10 .",
    "this anomalous low-@xmath0 behavior can be interpreted as being indicative of the suppression of long wavelength density fluctuations due to hyperuniformity @xcite . here , we propose an alternative interpretation related to large length - scale collective dynamics .",

    "we provide a brief overview of the molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations used here to generate liquid and jammed states .",

    "this is followed by a discussion on the relevant concepts from liquid state theories that indicate that our results and those of ref .   for frictionless particles",
    "are indeed rather unusual .",
    "we then present our results for the static structure factor , @xmath3 , at small values of the wavenumber @xmath0 , in our jammed , model glassy system .",
    "we then put forward a conjecture that relates the asymptotic behavior of @xmath3 to an excess of vibrational modes relative to the debye model .",
    "we end with results from ongoing work on frictional systems and conclusions .",
    "the computer simulations performed here are for monodisperse , _ soft spheres _ of diameter @xmath11 and mass @xmath12 , interacting through a finite range , purely repulsive , one - sided , harmonic potential , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the center - to - center separation between particles @xmath15 and @xmath16 located at @xmath17 .",
    "the strength of the interaction is parameterized by @xmath18 , which is set to unity in this study .",
    "most of the results presented below are for frictionless particles , with friction coefficient @xmath19 .",
    "we also present preliminary results for frictional packings using a static friction model @xcite to compare between frictionless and frictional systems . in the frictional packings",
    "the particle friction coefficient was varied , @xmath20 .",
    "we simulated systems ranging in size , @xmath21 particles , in cubic simulation cells of size @xmath22 , with periodic boundary conditions , over a range of packing fractions , @xmath23 .",
    "the jamming protocol implemented here to generate zero - temperature jammed packings is similar to other soft - sphere protocols @xcite .",
    "initially , starting from a collection of spheres randomly placed in the simulation cell at low packing fraction @xmath24 , we compressed the system to a specified over - compressed state , @xmath25 , minimizing the energy of the system in a steepest descent manner . at this value of @xmath26 , all the particles experience overlaps with several other particles - their contact neighbors .",
    "the packings are mechanically stable and disordered with no signs of long range order . to generate packings at @xmath27 ,",
    "we then incrementally reduced @xmath28 in steps of , @xmath29 , minimizing the energy after each step .",
    "this allowed us to accurately determine the location of the jamming transition where the system unjams at a packing fraction @xmath30 ( see below ) , for _ each independent realization _ , down to an accuracy of @xmath31 in @xmath28 for @xmath32 and an accuracy of @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "for the largest system , @xmath35 , we generated four independent configurations at each value of @xmath28 .",
    "we also studied equilibrated liquids of frictionless spheres at a dimensionless temperatures @xmath36 .",
    "this value of @xmath37 was chosen to compare and contrast our results between liquid and jammed states .",

    "although the data is noisy at the lowest wavenumbers , our largest packings ( @xmath35 ) display the anomalous low-@xmath0 behavior , as described below , well above the noise level . throughout this study , @xmath41 , and",
    "all quantities have been appropriately non - dimensionalized .",
    "frictionless , purely repulsive , soft sphere system have been shown to undergo a zero - temperature transition between jammed and unjammed phases as a function of density or packing fraction @xcite . in the infinite - size limit",
    ", this transition occurs at a packing fraction coincident with the value often quoted for random close packing , @xmath42 @xcite . above the jamming threshold @xmath43 ,",
    "the jammed state is mechanically stable to perturbations with non - zero bulk and shear moduli , whereas below the transition @xmath44 , it costs no energy to disturb the system @xcite .",
    "the relevant parameter here is not the absolute value of the packing fraction , rather the _ distance _ to the jamming transition defined through , @xmath45 .",
    "thus , as a jammed state is brought closer to the transition point , @xmath46 , it gradually loses its mechanical rigidity and becomes increasingly soft .",
    "intriguingly , this loss of mechanical stability as the jamming transition is approached can be related to diverging length scales @xcite that characterize the extent of soft regions that determine the macroscopic behavior of system @xcite .",
    "experiments @xcite have also identified growing length scales in the vicinity of the jamming transition thus promoting the idea that the jamming transition can be considered in the context of critical phenomena .    in this paper , we connect the long wavelength structural features observed in @xmath3 to correlation lengths characterizing the typical length scale of collective , low - frequency vibrational modes in jammed , zero - temperature , disordered packings @xcite . in ref .",
    "it was shown that the approach of the jamming transition in a soft sphere packing is accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of low - frequency vibrational modes over the expected debye behavior . in traditional glasses , these excess low - frequency modes in the vibrational density of states , @xmath47",

    "these correlation lengths scale with the boson peak position as @xcite , @xmath66 thus , when the debye contribution , @xmath67 , is included the corresponding dispersion relations become , @xmath68 the preceeding relations are only approximate , valid for low frequencies .",
    "they both contribute to the boson peak : the longitudinal term by modifying the slope in the debye relation , whereas the transverse contribution contains an anharmonic term .",
    "we discuss the relevance of these results further below .      in order to avoid any misunderstanding",
    "we define the concepts of regular and singular in the following sense @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath0 to be a complex variable , for any three dimensional system interacting with tempered pairwise , additive potentials , namely when @xmath69 and therefore integrable , @xmath70 .",
    "then , the structure factor , in the long wavelength limit reads @xcite , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the number density , @xmath73 is a constant that depends on the thermodynamic properties of the equilibrium system , and @xmath74 is an analytic function of @xmath0 , regular in the neighborhood of @xmath75 .",
    "thus , the second term on the right hand side of eq .  [ eq9 ] is the regular contribution to @xmath3 , whereas the first term - originating from the potential of interaction - is the singular term .",
    "for instance , when @xmath76 , as in the attractive part of the lennard - jones potential , @xmath77 a result originally derived by enderby , gaskill , and march @xcite .",

    "physically , this would correspond to a charge - dipole interaction , which chan _ et al .",
    "@xcite have shown can only be present if _ long - ranged _ dipole - dipole interactions are also included .",
    "thus , in the present work , the linear behavior of @xmath3 , at small @xmath0 , does not come from the potential of interaction , as the finite range harmonic potential used here will only give the regular contribution to @xmath3 .",
    "however , this does suggest that the anomalous low-@xmath0 behavior originates in long - ranged correlations associated with the system .",
    "we initially generated a number of over - compressed , @xmath43 , zero - temperature packings at various distances , @xmath79 , from the jamming transition point .",
    "we also point out that the main distinction between this work and that of ref .  , is that we study soft - spheres and approach the jamming transition from above , @xmath80 , whereas",

    ", @xmath3 exhibits a linear behavior at small values of momentum transfer .",
    "hence , this unusual behavior not only pertains to hard spheres , but also to soft spheres , both above and below the jamming transition point , and possibly , to finite range repulsive potentials in general .",
    "we will attempt below to produce what we believe is a reasonable explanation for the origin of this behavior which , as stated at the beginning , does appeal to a conjecture .",
    "since , in the long wavelength limit , the linear behavior of @xmath3 can not arise from the singular contribution of the potential used in this work @xcite , it can only be due to the collective excitations present in the jammed or glassy state @xcite .",

    "@xcite does indeed show that the excitations leading to the boson peak are predominantly collective ; in agreement with inelastic neutron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "although there have been a number of theories put forward @xcite , there is , at present , no agreed explanation as to the origins of the boson peak .",
    "for the purposes of this work this is not necessary , except insofar as there is agreement that these excitations are predominantly collective , and that the vibrational modes are likely to be kinetically driven .",
    "the arguments that follow are somewhat oversimplified , but we believe they are along the correct lines .",
    "the following comments are in order : ( i ) in a system that undergoes the liquid - glass transition , the long wavelength limit of the static structure factor , @xmath118 , is not the thermodynamic compressibility @xmath119 , but a different value , say @xmath120 , which can actually be extracted from experiments @xcite .",
    "( ii ) independently of the model or approximation used , the density fluctuations in the glass phase are kinetically , not thermodynamically , driven @xcite .",
    "( iii ) in spite of their different origins , the kinetic temperature , say @xmath121 , defined for glasses , matches the edwards temperature , @xmath122 , used in granular matter .",
    "they happen to coincide within mean field theories when the glass is in contact with an almost zero temperature heat bath , and the athermal grains are jammed @xcite .",
    "the connection between the dispersion relations and the structure factor , follows from the second moment of the dynamical structure factor , @xmath123 @xcite , @xmath124 where @xmath125 ( for a system in thermodynamic equilibrium @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is boltzmann s constant ) . the static structure factor is the zero moment of @xmath123 , @xmath128    we now put forward the following conjecture : assume that there is only one very well defined collective mode with dispersion relation @xmath129 , the boson peak .",
    "this gives us a relation between the asymptotic long wavelength behavior of @xmath3 and the boson peak , @xmath130 whence , @xmath131 this collective mode is associated with vibrational excitations with a wavelength of the order of the correlation length of the jammed state .",
    "we expand the dispersion relation at these small values of momentum transfer @xcite @xmath132 in eq .",
    "[ eq15 ] , @xmath133 is the speed of sound , and the second term on the rhs denotes departures from the usual debye behavior , such that both @xmath133 and @xmath134 are independent of @xmath0 .",

    "[ eq15 ] into [ eq14 ] , in the limit of @xmath90 , we find , @xmath135 thus , on comparing eqs .",
    "[ eq15 ] and [ eq16 ] to eqs .",
    "[ eq6 ] and [ eq7 ] , it transpires that it is the transverse modes that contribute to the linear behavior of @xmath3 . on the other hand , the longitudinal components , eq .",
    "[ eq6 ] , only contribute a constant term to @xmath3 , modifying the slope of the debye relation .",
    "we illustrate the differences in the dispersion behavior at two extreme values of @xmath136 and @xmath137 in fig .",
    "these results were obtained from diagonalization of the dynamical matrix for systems with @xmath138 and then locating the peaks in the transverse components of the fourier transforms of the eigenmodes - transverse mode structure factors @xcite - and then averaging over a small range of frequencies .",
    "the data shown in fig .  [ fig5 ] distinguishes between the regular , linear dispersion relation that dominates the dispersion behavior far from the jamming transition at @xmath82 , while the quadratic contribution to the dispersion behavior is significant closer to the jamming transition , @xmath136 .     and @xmath139 .",
    "the solid lines correspond to quadratic fits to the data as in eq .",
    "data obtained from the low - frequency portion of the transverse structure factors of the vibrational modes for @xmath140.,width=264 ]    from the analysis we obtain the transverse speed of sound , @xmath141 , as a fitting parameter . at these two compressions : @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "the actual values calculated from the bulk and shear moduli data @xcite give : @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "therefore , we find reasonable agreement within this approximation .",
    "if we use only a linear dispersion relation we find that the values of @xmath141 computed here and the actual values @xcite vary by as much as an order of magnitude .",
    "this can be realized by the observation that a linear fit to data for @xmath146 does not pass through the origin as required in the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "the linear feature of @xmath3 in the small-@xmath0 regime appears here as a consequence of assuming an `` excess '' relative to the debye model for the dispersion relation , and only one collective mode .",
    "although the `` excess '' model used here appears as an approximation appropriate for the low-@xmath0 regime , we have reconciled this with existing results on the emergence of characteristic length scales associated with these collective excitations . more generally , however , it does suggest that the boson peak and the linear behavior of @xmath3 , as @xmath90 , are two sides of the same coin . therefore , this anomalous suppression of long - wavelength density fluctuations emerges as a consequence of large length - scale correlated dynamics in the low - frequency modes of the jammed solid . furthermore , although the boson peak has been traditionally associated with the glassy phase , recent low frequency raman spectroscopic studies of glassy , supercooled , and molten silica reveal that the boson peak persists into the liquid phase @xcite .",
    "this also appears to be the case with other network systems ( see references in ref .  ) which , in the molten state , show a distinctive prepeak at small @xmath0 in @xmath3 .",
    "this prepeak is indicative of intermediate range order in those melts , representing a characteristic length in those melts that measures the correlations between the centers of `` clusters '' present in the liquid state .",
    "this intermediate - range clustering may in fact promote longer wavelength correlated dynamics in the liquid state .",
    "it may therefore be interesting to investigate experimentally , and by means of md simulations , whether the low @xmath0-behavior of @xmath3 in those systems is also linear , both in their glassy and liquid phases .",
    "studies on jammed packings of _ frictional _ particles are less well - developed .",
    "the picture that is emerging is that frictional packings undergo a similar zero - temperature jamming transition at packing fractions which now become friction dependent @xcite . in the limit of high friction coefficient",
    "the frictional jamming transition coincides with the value associated with random loose packing , @xmath147 @xcite .",
    "thus the relevant parameter that measures the distance to the jamming transition now becomes a friction - dependent quantity , @xmath148 @xcite .",
    ", focusing on the low-@xmath0 region .",
    "all packings at the same @xmath149 , contain @xmath35 purely - repulsive , monodisperse , soft - spheres , with different friction coefficients @xmath150.,width=264 ]    we test these concepts through @xmath3 for packings over a range of friction coefficients at the _ same _ @xmath149 , which translates to different values of @xmath148 . our preliminary results in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] are data for @xmath3 for jammed packings with @xmath151 . at this fixed value of @xmath149 , @xmath148 increases with increasing friction coefficient .",
    "therefore , we expect that the anomalous linear behavior in the low-@xmath0 region of @xmath3 should become less prominent with increasing @xmath152 .",
    "indeed this trend is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , thus providing yet further evidence that the jamming transition point shifts to lower @xmath28 with increasing friction . to recover the linear behavior at low-@xmath0 in frictional packings",
    "we would therefore need to study mechanically stable packings at lower @xmath28 .",
    "this work in ongoing .",
    "in conclusion , we have provided a physical , albeit naive , explanation for the observation of the apparent suppression of long wavelength density fluctuations in jammed model glassy materials .",
    "we submit that it is the presence of low - frequency , collective excitations , mainly of transverse character , contributing to the excess of low - frequency modes , that are responsible for the linear behavior at low-@xmath0 in @xmath3 .",
    "the relevant length scale here is the transversal correlation length that contributes to the diverging boson peak in the jammed phase .",
    "this low-@xmath0 feature is most pronounced in the model system studied here for soft particles at packing fractions above the zero - temperature jamming transition matching the behavior on the other side of the jamming transition for hard spheres .",
    "this connection between the long - wavelength behavior on either side of the transition reinforces the view that the jamming transition is critical in nature .",
    "although we also point out that the jamming transition is very different from a thermodynamic liquid - gas critical point in that we do not observe a divergence in @xmath153 , but rather it becomes zero .",
    "moreover , we expect that as the transition is approached , @xmath154 the dependence of @xmath155 on a generalized temperature - like quantity , @xmath156 , in jammed packings is consistent with the concept of the _ angoricity _ @xcite .",
    "this plays the role of temperature in packings of elastic particles and goes to zero when the particles fall out of contact which occurs at the jamming transition .",
    "future studies may also provide a way to understand the connection between different temperature definitions relevant to the study of thermal and jammed systems .",
    "our preliminary data for frictional packings also provide further evidence that the location of the jamming transition occurs at lower packing fractions with increasing friction coefficient .",
    "the underlying nature of the low - frequency modes in frictional materials has yet to be investigated in three dimensional systems and forms part of ongoing work .",
    "when friction is present the modes will contain not only the translational character as seen in frictionless systems , but also rotational character due to the additional degrees of freedom .",
    "this anomalous low-@xmath0 behavior is also likely to be present in other , finite range , model repulsive systems .",

    "<S> the structural properties of static , jammed packings of monodisperse spheres in the vicinity of the jamming transition are investigated using large - scale computer simulations . at small wavenumber @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , we argue that the anomalous behavior in the static structure factor , @xmath1 , is consequential of an excess of low - frequency , collective excitations seen in the vibrational spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this anomalous feature becomes more pronounced closest to the jamming transition , such that @xmath2 at the transition point . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce an appropriate dispersion relation that accounts for these phenomena that leads us to relate these structural features to characteristic length scales associated with the low - frequency vibrational modes of these systems . when the particles are frictional , this anomalous behavior is suppressed providing yet more evidence that jamming transitions of frictional spheres lie at lower packing fractions that that for frictionless spheres . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that the mechanical properties of jammed and glassy media may therefore be inferred from measurements of both the static and dynamical structure factors . </S>"
