    "observations of the rotation curves of galaxies and clusters , in addition to joint fits of type  ia supernova data and the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background , suggest that the density of matter in the current universe is @xmath030% of the closure density , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "however , the success of big bang nucleosynthesis in explaining the primordial abundances of light elements , especially the primordial abundance ratio of d / h , requires that the contribution of baryons is only @xmath9 ( 95% confidence ; tytler et al .",
    "2000 ) , where @xmath10  km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11 and @xmath12 is the present day hubble constant .",
    "the majority of the matter must be something else .",
    "one class of possibilities involves hypothesized exotic particles , from light particles such as axions ( peccei & quinn 1977 ) to heavier particles such as the neutralino ( e.g. , jungman , kamionkowski , & greist 1996 ) or even ultramassive particles such as  wimpzillas \" ( kolb , chung , & riotto 1998 ; hui & stewart 1999 ) .",
    "another class , which we focus on in this paper , involves dark matter that occurs primarily in @xmath13 clumps .",
    "this class , which has received recent attention because this is the mass scale of objects discovered by microlensing projects such as macho , eros , and ogle , has several specific candidates .",
    "for example , black holes may have formed during the qcd phase transition from quark matter to nucleonic matter ( jedamzik 1997 , 1998 ; niemeyer & jedamzik 1999 ) , during which the horizon mass was plausibly in the @xmath14 range .",
    "other suggestions involve quark stars ( banerjee et al .",
    "2000 ) , boson stars ( colpi , shapiro , & wasserman 1986 ; mielke & schunck 2000 ) , and stars formed of mirror matter ( mohapatra & teplitz 1999 ) . here",
    "we consider those members of this class that involve primordial compact objects , specifically those objects which ( 1 )  existed before the @xmath2 epoch of decoupling , and ( 2 )  have a mass to radius ratio of @xmath15 .",
    "these include black holes , quark stars , and boson stars , but not mirror matter stars , as they are envisioned to form at comparatively late times and to be comparable to ordinary stars in their compactness ( mohapatra & teplitz 1999 ) .",
    "primordial compact objects will accrete from the ambient medium and will therefore generate substantial luminosity .",
    "this luminosity can ionize the surrounding medium . unlike the energy spectra from ordinary stars , which drop off rapidly above the ground state ionization energy of hydrogen , the energy spectra from accreting compact objects",
    "are known observationally to be very hard , with substantial components above 1  kev and often extending above 100  kev .",
    "an important consequence of this is that whereas the stromgren sphere of ionization around , say , an o or b star is extremely sharply defined , with an exponentially decreasing ionization fraction outside the critical radius , the ionization fraction produced by an accreting compact object dies off relatively slowly with radius , as @xmath16 ( silk 1971 ; carr 1981 ) .",
    "therefore , accretion onto a primordial object can produce ionization over a large volume in the early universe .",
    "if the resulting optical depth to thomson scattering is too large , it will conflict with the upper limit to this optical depth derived from the observed anisotropy of the microwave background ( griffiths , barbosa , & liddle 1999 ) .",
    "conversely , the upper limit on the optical depth can be used to constrain the properties of primordial compact objects , if these are proposed as the dominant component of dark matter .    here",
    "we calculate the ionization produced by compact objects accreting in the early universe .",
    "we find that the ionization produced by secondary electrons , an effect not included in previous analyses of reionization by accretion , increases substantially the ionization fraction and hence the optical depth to thomson scattering . in ",
    "2 we show that the thomson optical depth out to the @xmath17 redshift of decoupling is @xmath18^{1/2 } ( h_0/65)^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath4 is the accretion efficiency @xmath19 divided by 0.1 and @xmath6 is the fraction of matter in primordial compact objects . we compare this result to the current observational upper limit of @xmath20 , and show that either low accretion efficiency or low mass is required if dark matter is mostly composed of primordial compact objects . in ",
    "3 we consider low - efficiency accretion such as flows dominated by advection or wind outflow .",
    "we show that the constraints from ionization are especially tight on objects without horizons . in   4 we place this result in the context of previous constraints on , for example , primordial black holes as the main component of dark matter .",
    "we also discuss future improvements to our result .",
    "in particular , we show that the expected accuracy of optical depth measurements with map and planck could decrease the upper bound on @xmath21 by a further factor of @xmath0100 .",
    "if the number density of baryons is @xmath22 ( where in this entire calculation we assume @xmath23 ) and the ionization fraction is @xmath24 , then the optical depth to thomson scattering between redshifts @xmath25 and @xmath26 is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the thomson scattering cross section and @xmath29 is the distance traveled by a photon in this redshift interval . here",
    "@xmath30^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are the current contributions to the mass energy of the universe from , respectively , matter , curvature , and the cosmological constant . at @xmath23",
    "the first term dominates , so that @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the differential optical depth is then @xmath36 ( see also haiman & knox 1999 ) .",
    "this needs to be integrated out to the @xmath2 redshift of decoupling to determine the optical depth to scattering in the early universe .",
    "the main unknown in this expression is the ionization fraction @xmath24 . in the remainder of this section , therefore , we compute the ionization produced by radiation from accreting compact objects . in   2.1 we compute the luminosity and spectrum of this radiation .",
    "we assume bondi - hoyle accretion and a spectrum corresponding to that observed from many neutron stars and black hole candidates . in ",
    "2.2 we use the ionization balance equation to calculate the ionization produced by a single source .",
    "we include the effects of ionization by secondary electrons , which is a significant effect not included in the analysis of pregalactic black hole accretion by carr ( 1981 ) . in   2.3",
    "we show that the ionizing flux from sources spread throughout the universe increases significantly the ionization fraction . finally , in   2.4 we calculate the optical depth to thomson scattering out to the @xmath2 redshift of decoupling , including the effects of compton cooling by the microwave background .",
    "let us now consider accreting objects of mass @xmath37 .",
    "suppose that these masses are moving with the hubble flow , so that the main parameter governing the accretion rate is the speed of sound in the gas at infinity , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the polytropic index , @xmath40 is the mass of the proton , and @xmath41 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "for pure hydrogen ( @xmath42 ) , the mass accretion rate from a perfect gas with @xmath43 is then @xmath44 where @xmath45  k and @xmath46 is the temperature of the gas at infinity . for a primordial composition of 75% hydrogen and 25% helium by mass ,",
    "this accretion rate is more than doubled because helium has half the velocity for a given temperature that hydrogen does , and hence accretes at eight times the rate for a given mass density .",
    "we therefore take the coefficient to be @xmath47 .",
    "if accretion produces a luminosity with an efficiency @xmath48 , so that @xmath49  erg  s@xmath11 , then @xmath50 the best estimate of the baryon density in the current universe from big bang nucleosynthesis constraints ( tytler et al .",
    "2000 ) is @xmath51 at a redshift @xmath25 this density is therefore @xmath52 .",
    "hence , if the compact object accretes matter with the average baryonic density in the universe , the luminosity at redshift @xmath25 is @xmath53 pressure balance of a hot hii region with the cooler exterior universe may decrease the density of accreting matter and therefore decrease this luminosity ( see below ) . in accreting black hole sources from stellar mass to agn , and also in some accreting neutron stars , the spectrum often has a power - law tail with equal power in equal logarithmic intervals of the photon energy , up to some @xmath54 : @xmath55 .",
    "the results of our calculation are fairly insensitive to the assumed spectrum . normalizing this spectrum so that the total luminosity above @xmath56  ev is @xmath57 , the differential photon flux at energy @xmath58 a distance @xmath59 from the compact object is @xmath60 here @xmath61 is the optical depth at a distance @xmath59 from the source to photons of energy @xmath58 .",
    "note that carr ( 1981 ) chose a spectrum of a bremsstrahlung form ( @xmath62 ) , and hence had a different energy dependence and normalization for the photon number flux .",
    "a given photon can effectively produce many ionizations , because the ionized electrons can collisionally ionize other atoms ( see , e.g. , silk & werner 1969 ; silk 1971 ) .",
    "the collisional cross section exceeds @xmath63",
    "@xmath64 for electron energies between @xmath015  ev and 1  kev ( see dalgarno , yan , & liu 1999 for a recent discussion of electron energy deposition ) .",
    "dalgarno et al .",
    "( 1999 ) calculate that the mean energy per ion pair decreases with increasing initial electron energy , reaching a limit of 36.1  ev per pair at energies @xmath65200  ev . using their figure  6 ,",
    "we adopt an approximate value of @xmath66 hydrogen atoms ionized by a photon of initial energy @xmath58 ; this is a rough average over the energy range of interest , and we assume for simplicity that it is constant over that range .",
    "the effective ionization rate produced by the photons generated by accretion is therefore ( adapting the formula of carr 1981 ) @xmath67 where @xmath68  @xmath64 is the abundance - weighted ionization cross section at @xmath69 .",
    "the integrand in this formula is a constant factor @xmath70 times the integrand in the corresponding formula in carr ( 1981 ) .",
    "the difference arises because we assume a different form for the spectrum and account for the ionization produced by secondary electrons .",
    "the remainder of the analysis of the ionization region created by a single source follows the treatment of carr ( 1981 ) , with this factor included .",
    "this is a large factor , of order 25 for @xmath71  erg , and it therefore makes a crucial difference to the overall ionization . if @xmath72 , the ionization rate is approximately ( silk et al .",
    "1972 ) @xmath73\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath74 and the first factor in parentheses indicates the correction factor to the expression of carr ( 1981 ) . here @xmath75 is the ionized fraction at radius @xmath59 .",
    "the ionization balance equation is @xmath76 where around @xmath77",
    "k , the recombination coefficient not including single - photon transitions to the ground state ( which would release ionizing photons ) is @xmath78  @xmath79  s@xmath11 ( hummer 1994 ) .",
    "far from the accreting compact object , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 , the ionization fraction is @xmath82 where @xmath83^{1/3}\\ ; .\\ ] ] again , the initial factor in the equation for @xmath75 is the correction factor , which therefore increases the ionization fraction far from the compact object by a factor of @xmath05 ; note that the only remaining dependence on @xmath54 is @xmath84^{-1/2}$ ] , so this result is very insensitive to the high - energy cutoff of the spectrum .      the total ionization rate @xmath85 must be summed over the contributions of all sources . at large distances from a source , @xmath86 ,",
    "so that @xmath87 . for multiple sources separated by an average distance @xmath88 , the ionizing rate is larger than the single - source ionizing rate at a distance @xmath88 by a factor @xmath89 here @xmath90  @xmath91 is the number density of compact objects at redshift @xmath25 , where @xmath92 is the fraction of the closure density in compact objects .",
    "also , @xmath93 $ ]  cm is the mean free path to thomson scattering .",
    "the separation distance is approximately given by @xmath94 , so @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , @xmath96 the ratio of radii is typically @xmath97 , so the enhancement due to the contributions of multiple sources is approximately a factor of 50 .    when multiple sources are included , the ionization fraction ( for @xmath80 ) is increased by a factor that is approximately the square root of the factor by which the ionization rate is enhanced .",
    "at a distance @xmath59 the rate is enhanced by a factor @xmath98 and hence the ionization fraction including multiple sources is @xmath99 integrating this from @xmath100 to @xmath88 , the volume - averaged ionization is @xmath101 here @xmath102  cm .",
    "an evaluation of this expression for the ionization fraction requires knowledge of the luminosity of individual sources and the average temperature of the matter in the universe . as pointed out by , e.g. , carr ( 1981 ) , the dominant cooling process at high redshifts is inverse compton cooling off of the microwave background . if the temperature @xmath103 of the matter is much larger than the temperature @xmath104 of the radiation background , then the cooling rate per volume at redshift @xmath25 is @xmath105 the average heating rate is just the luminosity per source times the number density of sources : @xmath106 at @xmath107 , where the optical depth to thomson scattering exceeds unity and as we will see @xmath108 , the cooling rate dominates the heating rate and hence the matter temperature is locked to the radiation temperature during this epoch ( see also carr 1981 ) .",
    "this increases the recombination rate over most of the volume of interest , and therefore decreases the optical depth to scattering .",
    "inside the hii region , by contrast , heating dominates cooling and the temperature remains close to @xmath109  k for @xmath110 ; in fact , carr ( 1981 ) finds that the temperature is @xmath111 .",
    "the temperature difference means that pressure balance requires that the density inside the hii region be less than the average density by a factor @xmath112 ; note , however , that this configuration requires the support against gravity of a denser by a less dense medium , which therefore is in principle rayleigh - taylor unstable .",
    "hence , mixing could occur which would decrease the temperature and increase the density of the hii region .",
    "if mixing does not occur , the density of the matter accreting onto the compact object is decreased by a factor @xmath113 . the ionization fraction and hence the optical depth",
    "would therefore be reduced by the square root of this factor , or about @xmath114 . the uncertainty of whether there is an interchange instability and mixing thus produces an uncertainty of a factor @xmath02 in the optical depth to scattering .    with these contributions ,",
    "the average ionization is @xmath115^{1/2}z^{0.7}\\ ; .\\ ] ]    the differential optical depth to scattering is @xmath116 , so using @xmath117  @xmath91 and evaluating the constants , this is @xmath118^{1/2 } \\epsilon_{-1}^{1/2}(m / m_\\odot)^{1/2 } ( h_0/65\\,{\\rm km}\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}\\,{\\rm mpc}^{-1})^{-1 } f_{\\rm co}^{1/2}z^{1.2}\\,dz\\ ; .\\ ] ] here @xmath119 is the fraction of matter in compact objects .",
    "integrating from a small redshift to the redshift @xmath17 at decoupling gives finally @xmath120^{1/2 } \\left(h_0\\over{65}\\right)^{-1}\\ ; .\\ ] ]    the effect of this optical depth on the observed cmb power spectrum is not identical to the effect of the same optical depth if it came from sudden and complete reionization at some lower redshift @xmath121 .",
    "the reason is that the mechanism described here produces most of the optical depth at comparatively high redshifts , @xmath122 , and hence for optical depths in excess of unity the scatterings occur close to recombination where some of the primordial anisotropy is maintained . in contrast , scattering at low redshift exponentially suppresses the primordial anisotropy .",
    "however , if the optical depth is less than unity this effect is less pronounced in the reionization mechanism discussed in this paper , because scatterings occur over a wide range of redshift and hence tend to smooth out small - scale anisotropies in the same way as would happen due to scattering at much lower redshifts .",
    "these qualitative effects are confirmed by simulations with cmbfast ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 and subsequent papers ) , which show that for @xmath123 the constraints on the optical depth from the observed cmb power spectrum are roughly the same for this mechanism as for late reionization .",
    "the observational upper limit to @xmath124 from small - scale cmb anisotropy is @xmath125 if @xmath126 and the primordial power spectrum has an index @xmath127 ( griffiths et al .",
    "1999 ) . to be consistent with this limit",
    ", primordial compact objects must therefore be either low - efficiency accretors , low - mass objects , or a minor component of dark matter .",
    "given that the measured mass spectrum of machos in our galaxy has a peak in the @xmath128 range ( alcock et al .",
    "2000 ; note , however , that most of the mass in the halo need not be in machos [ gates et al .",
    "1998 , alcock et al .",
    "2000 ] and a higher - mass component is not ruled out [ lasserre et al .  2000 ] ) , explanation of these objects with a population that composes most of the dark matter in the universe requires low - efficiency accretion , which we consider in the next section .",
    "these constraints are particularly strict for higher - mass black holes .",
    "the joint limits on @xmath37 and @xmath129 are shown in figure  1 , for three different upper limits to the thomson optical depth : @xmath124=0.4 , 0.14 , or 0.05 , which are the optical depths obtained if the the universe was fully and suddenly reionized at a redshift of @xmath130=40 , 20 , or 10 , respectively .",
    "in the last few years there has been much discussion of the possibility that , for low accretion rates , an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) is set up in which the radiative efficiency onto black holes is low because the matter flows almost radially into the hole , taking almost all of its energy with it ( e.g. , narayan & yi 1994 ; abramowicz et al .",
    ". the radiative efficiency according to these solutions could be extremely low , and hence might allow a large matter density in black holes .",
    "if the compact object does not have a horizon , then an adaf will not reduce the radiative efficiency , so this is not a way out .",
    "another possibility is that most of the accreting matter does not reach the surface at all , perhaps because it is driven out in a wind .",
    "this is the basis of the advection - dominated inflow - outflow solution ( adios ) proposed by blandford & begelman ( 1999 ) .",
    "convective flow , in which the net inward flow rate at small radii is small , has also been found analytically by quataert & narayan ( 1999 ) and in numerical simulations by stone , pringle , & begelman ( 1999 ) .",
    "if in bondi - hoyle accretion the result of the accretion is inflow of a small fraction of matter combined with outflow of most of the matter , then the accretion efficiency onto even objects without horizons could be small .",
    "however , there is a crucial unsolved problem with these flows , which is whether they will remain at low efficiency indefinitely if there is a steady inflow of matter from infinity , as in bondi - hoyle accretion .",
    "if instead the accretion proceeds as in a dwarf nova , in which there is a long - term buildup of matter followed by a short - term , high - luminosity episode during which the accumulated matter is dumped onto the central object , then current accretion theory suggests the accretion will generate radiation efficiently regardless of the nature of the compact object . in such a case ,",
    "neither black holes nor any other type of primordial compact object are viable candidates for most of the dark matter in the universe .",
    "consideration of compact objects as components of dark matter has often been restricted to black holes , but many of the arguments apply more generally . black holes with masses in excess of @xmath131 are ruled out as a significant component of galactic halos because their dynamical interactions with globular clusters would destroy the clusters ( for a recent calculation see arras & wasserman 1999 ) .",
    "the lack of an increase in the number of low equivalent width quasars with increasing redshift ( expected to be caused by gravitational lensing ) rules out a contribution @xmath132 from any objects with masses between @xmath133 and @xmath134 that are more compact than their einstein radii ( dalcanton et al .",
    "the lack of observed lensing of cosmological gamma - ray bursts also allows weak limits to be placed on the contribution of black holes of various sizes : @xmath135 at the 90% level for @xmath136 , @xmath137 at the @xmath138 level for @xmath139 , and @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) or @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) at the 95% level for @xmath144 ( marani et al .",
    "1999 ) .    here",
    "we show that ionization from compact object accretion in the early post - decoupling universe is more significant than had been thought previously , because of the effects of secondary ionization by electrons .",
    "the result is that , barring inefficient accretion ( @xmath145 for @xmath146 , @xmath147 for @xmath148 ) , primordial compact objects in this mass range can not compose a significant fraction of the mass of the universe , because they would ionize the universe enough to conflict with the measured small - scale anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "if further analysis and numerical simulation of flows onto black holes demonstrates that the long - term time averaged accretion efficiency is @xmath149 , as might happen if matter tends to pile up as in a dwarf nova and then accrete quickly with efficient radiation , then all masses greater than @xmath150 are excluded from making a significant contribution .",
    "future cmb missions such as map and planck could strengthen these constraints considerably .",
    "the optical depth resolution of map is expected to be 0.022 , and of planck is expected to be 0.004 ( zaldarriaga , spergel , & seljak 1997 ; bouchet , prunet , & sethi 1999 ; eisenstein , hu , & tegmark 1999 ) . since the existence of a ly@xmath151 emitter at @xmath152 ( see haiman & spaans 1999 ) shows that reionization must have occurred before then , this means that both satellites , and especially planck , will be able to detect the effects of ionization regardless of the actual redshift of reionization .",
    "if @xmath153 then the redshift of reionization could even be determined directly with sirtf or ngst via , e.g. , analysis of the damping wing of the gunn - peterson trough ( miralda - escud 1998 ) or detection of transmitted flux between lyman resonances ( haiman & loeb 1999 ) . the upper limit on the product @xmath154 scales like @xmath155 ( or , for @xmath23 , like @xmath156 ) , so if @xmath153 this upper limit is decreased by almost a factor of 100 . in this case , barring extremely inefficient accretion , dark matter must be composed of less compact objects or of wimps .",
