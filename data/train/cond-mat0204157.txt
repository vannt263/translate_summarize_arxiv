    "<S> we propose a generalization of classical statistical mechanics which describes the behavior of dissipative systems placed in contact with a heat bath . in contrast to conventional statistical mechanics , which assigns probabilities to the _ states _ of the system , the generalized theory assigns probabilities to the _ trajectories _ of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the conditional probability of pairs of states at two different times is given by a path integral . </S>",
    "<S> we present two simple analytically - tractable examples which illustrate the predicted effect of temperature on the mean trajectories , hysteresis and drift of the system .    </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental question addressed in the present communication is : _ how does a dissipative system behave when it is placed in contact with a heat bath ? _ it should be carefully noted that the systems under consideration are dissipative _ ab initio _ , e.  g. , as a result of internal friction , viscosity , or some other dissipative mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the systems are irreversible , path dependent , and exhibit hysteresis . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the objective of the theory is _ not _ to understand how dissipation arises from the coarse - graining of a conservative system or in connection with first - order phase transitions ( see @xcite for notable examples of that line of inquiry ) . instead </S>",
    "<S> , the focus is in understanding how a heat bath influences the behavior of a dissipative system ; what are the statistical properties of its trajectories ; and how the effective behavior depends on temperature .    for definiteness , we consider systems whose state is defined by an @xmath0-dimensional array @xmath1 of generalized coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> the energetics of the system is described by an energy function @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the explicit time dependence of @xmath3 may arise , e.  </S>",
    "<S> g. , as a result of the application to the system of a time - dependent external field . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the system is assumed to possess _ viscosity _ , and , thus , the equilibrium equations are of the form : @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the viscous forces . </S>",
    "<S> these equilibrium equations define a set of ordinary differential equations which , given appropriate conditions at , e.  g. , @xmath6 , can be solved for the trajectory @xmath7 , @xmath8 .    if the system is conservative , i.  e. , if @xmath9 , the instantaneous state @xmath7 of the system at time @xmath10 follows directly from energy minimization , i.  e. , from the problem : @xmath11 in order to extend this variatonal framework to dissipative systems , we resort to time discretization , leading to a _ sequence _ of minimization problems of the form ( [ eq : mine ] ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we consider a _ time - discretized _ incremental process consisting of a sequence of states @xmath12 at times @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> we additionally assume that the viscous forces @xmath5 derive from a kinetic potential @xmath17 through the relation : @xmath18 and introduce the incremental work function : @xmath19 where the minimum is taken over all paths @xmath7 such that @xmath20 and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental property of the incremental work function @xmath22 is that it acts as a potential for the forces @xmath23 at time @xmath24 , i.  e. , @xmath25 in order to verify this property , we may consider a small perturbation @xmath26 , leading to a corresponding perturbation of the path @xmath27 , with @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> then , in follows that @xmath29 but the integral on the right hand side of this equation is to be evaluated along the minimizing path , and hence it vanishes identically . </S>",
    "<S> this gives the identity @xmath30 since the variation @xmath31 is arbitrary , it follows that @xmath32 as stated . from this property </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the equilibrium equation @xmath33 is the euler - lagrange equation corresponding to the minimum principle : @xmath34 this behavior is indistinguishable from that a conservative system with ` energy ' @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it should be carefully noted that @xmath36 is determined by both the _ energetics _ and the _ kinetics _ of the system . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , @xmath36 depends on the initial conditions @xmath37 for the time step and , therefore , varies from step to step , which in turn allows for path dependency and hysteresis , as required . </S>",
    "<S> a simple situation arises when the kinetic potential @xmath38 is convex and coercive , i.  e. , it grows as @xmath39 , for some @xmath40 , for large @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the minimizing path is unique and consists of a straight segment joining @xmath37 and @xmath42 . under these conditions , </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding incremental work function is @xmath43 where we write @xmath44 .    </S>",
    "<S> now , imagine placing the system just described in contact with a heat bath at absolute temperature @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the objective is to predict the ensuing behavior of the system . for conservative systems , </S>",
    "<S> such behavior is predicted by standard gibbsian statistical mechanics , to wit : the probability of finding a state @xmath1 at time @xmath10 obeys boltzmann s distribution , i.  e. , is proportional to @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 is boltzmann s constant . in particular , the states of the system at two different times are uncorrelated . </S>",
    "<S> we proceed to show that the analogy between the minimum principles ( [ eq : mine ] ) and ( [ minw ] ) provides a basis for generalizing gibbs s prescription to dissipative systems . however , in contrast to conventional statistical mechanics , which assigns probabilities to the _ states _ of the system , the extended theory assigns probabilities to the _ trajectories _ of the system .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin by assuming that the incremental processes are markovian , i.  e. , @xmath42 is correlated to @xmath37 but not to earlier states . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath49 be the joint probability of @xmath42 and @xmath37 , and let    @xmath50    be the corresponding probabilities of @xmath42 and @xmath12 . then the conditional probability of @xmath42 given @xmath37 is @xmath51 this probability may also be interpreted as the transition probability from state @xmath37 to the new state @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> _ we postulate that the transition probability @xmath53 is gibbsian _ , </S>",
    "<S> i.  e. , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is an incremental partition function . </S>",
    "<S> it therefore follows that : @xmath56 iterating this relation we obtain @xmath57 in the limit of @xmath58 and @xmath59 at fixed @xmath60 , ( [ eq : pq ] ) defines a path integral of the form ( see , e.  g. , @xcite ) : @xmath61 } \\euscript d q\\ ] ] for some system - dependent work functional @xmath62 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> this path integral gives the conditional probability @xmath63 of finding the system in state @xmath64 at time @xmath8 given that the system is in state @xmath65 at time @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the integrand of ( [ eq : path ] ) may be interpreted as relating to the probability of individual trajectories @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , given two trajectories @xmath67 and @xmath68 , their relative probabilities are : @xmath69}{p[\\bq_2 ] } = \\frac{e^{-\\beta w[\\bq_1]}}{e^{-\\beta w[\\bq_2]}}\\ ] ] it is noteworthy that , in contrast to the conservative case , the presence of kinetics renders states of the system at different types _ </S>",
    "<S> correlated_. however , this correlation may be expected to decay with elapsed time , conferring the system a _ fading memory _ property .    in the remainder of this letter we present two simple analytically - tractable examples which provide a first illustration of the theory , namely : a linear spring - dashpot system ; and dry friction . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to their value as illustrative examples , these simple models should also useful as a basis for constructing _ mean - field _ approximations to more complex systems . </S>",
    "<S> the treatment of general systems requires the use of numerical schemes such as the path - integral monte carlo ( pimc ) method @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the linear spring - dashpot system is characterized by an energy function and kinetic potential of the form :    @xmath70    where @xmath71 , @xmath72 is the spring constant , @xmath73 is the dashpot viscosity , and @xmath74 is a time - dependent applied force . for this system , the equilibrium equations ( [ eq : equilibrium ] ) reduce to : @xmath75 the corresponding incremental work function for this system is : @xmath76 and the evaluation of the partition function entails a simple gaussian integral . inserting the result in ( [ eq : pq ] ) yields @xmath77 in the limit of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , with </S>",
    "<S> @xmath78 fixed , the sum in the exponential of this formula converges to the riemann integral @xmath79 =      \\int_0^t \\frac{1}{2\\eta } \\big ( \\kappa q(\\tau ) - f(\\tau ) +      \\eta \\dot{q}(\\tau ) \\big)^2 \\ , dt\\ ] ] in the same limit , ( [ eq : pq1d ] ) may be written as the path integral @xmath80 which is of the anticipated form ( [ eq : path ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of ( [ eq : path ] ) is revealing . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is observed that the work functional @xmath81 $ ] integrates in time the square of the equilibrium equation ( [ eq : equilibrium1d ] ) , reduced to units of power by means of the factor @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , the path which contributes the most to the path integral is the _ critical path _ , i.  e. , </S>",
    "<S> the path @xmath83 which minimizes the work functional ( [ eq : wfunc1d ] ) . indeed , in the limit of zero viscosity or zero temperature , the _ only _ path which contributes to the path integral is the critical path , which in that limit coincides with the deterministic trajectory , i.  e. , with the solution of ( [ eq : equilibrium1d ] ) . for finite viscosity and finite temperature , however , all paths contribute to the path integral to varying degrees , the contributions becoming increasingly weaker as the trajectories depart from the critical path . </S>",
    "<S> the stationarity of @xmath84 $ ] yields the euler - lagrange equations for the critical path @xmath85 where @xmath86 and the solution @xmath83 is subject to the boundary conditions @xmath87 , @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that this equation is of second order in time , whereas the original equilibrium equation ( [ eq : equilibrium1d ] ) is of first order . </S>",
    "<S> this increase in order makes it possible to enforce boundary conditions at times @xmath89 and @xmath10 , in contrast to the original equation ( [ eq : equilibrium1d ] ) which only allows for initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we note that ( [ eq : equilibrium2 ] ) is obtained by _ squaring _ ( [ eq : equilibrium1d ] ) , and thus the solutions of the latter are subsumed within the former . however , by virtue of its higher order the euler - lagrange equation ( [ eq : equilibrium2 ] ) has solutions which do not satisfy ( [ eq : equilibrium1d ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it thus follows that the critical path does not coincide with the deterministic trajectory in general . </S>",
    "<S> conveniently , the path integral ( [ eq : path ] ) can be evaluated exactly in closed form ( e.  g. , @xcite and @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the result is : @xmath90 ) } \\label{eq : p(q)}\\ ] ] where the critical path @xmath91 is the solution of ( [ eq : equilibrium2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vis - lin-10 ] shows the evolution of the probability density for a linear loading history @xmath92 in terms of the normalized variables @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 . the mean value @xmath96 traces the critical path @xmath97 , which , as noted earlier , differs from the classical path at finite viscosity and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> an additional effect of viscosity , which is clearly evident in these figures , is to cause the width of the probability density to broaden in time , with the attendant increase in the uncertainty of the state of the system .    </S>",
    "<S> the work functional ( [ eq : wfunc1d ] ) appearing in the path integral representation ( [ eq : path ] ) is characteristic of systems whose kinetic potential @xmath38 exhibits quadratic behavior near the origin . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are cases of interest which do not fall into that category . </S>",
    "<S> a case in point is provided by _ </S>",
    "<S> dry friction _ , which is characterized by a kinetic potential which has a vertex at the origin . </S>",
    "<S> consider , by way of example , a one - dimensional system sliding against a frictional resistance @xmath98 under the action of an applied force @xmath74 such that @xmath99 . in this particular case    @xmath100    and the incremental work function ( [ w ] ) </S>",
    "<S> specializes to @xmath101 as expected from the rate - independent nature of dry friction , @xmath36 is independent of @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding partition function ( [ eq : z ] ) , transition probability ( [ eq : trans ] ) , and probability density ( [ eq : pq ] ) take the form : @xmath103 @xmath104 and @xmath105 respectively . an important feature of the transition probability ( [ eq : df : trans ] ) is that it depends solely on the difference @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the chain @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath14 , @xmath109 defines a random walk , and the probability @xmath110 corresponding to the limit of @xmath58 and @xmath59 at constant @xmath111 follows by an application of the central limit theorem . </S>",
    "<S> the result is : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the mean path traced by the system , and @xmath114 measures the deviation from the mean path . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that , in the limit of zero temperature , @xmath115 for as long as @xmath116 , with the system sliding off to @xmath117 instantaneously as soon as @xmath118 reaches @xmath119 . by way of sharp contrast , at finite temperature the system undergoes sliding even when the applied force @xmath74 remains strictly below @xmath120 in magnitude at all times . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the standard deviation @xmath121 from the mean path is predicted to be proportional to temperature . by way of illustration of this behavior , the trajectories of the system corresponding to applied </S>",
    "<S> cyclic loads of the form @xmath122 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dry ] in terms of the normalized variables : @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 . </S>",
    "<S> the ability of the theory to allow for _ hysteresis _ and to predict its temperature dependence is particularly noteworthy . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the response of the system is predicted to soften with increasing temperature , in keeping with numerical simulations of magnetic systems @xcite . </S>"
