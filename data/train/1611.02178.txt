    "piecewise - smooth dynamical systems have attracted a lot of interest in the last decade . they are widely used to model switching or impact behaviour in many different areas of science i.e. as biology , engineering , physics or mathematics @xcite .",
    "systems with dry ( or coulomb ) friction are prominent examples in the context of piecewise - smooth models @xcite .",
    "the main feature of this type of friction is that an applied force has to overcome a certain threshold to move an object ( sliding ) , otherwise the object rests ( sticking ) .",
    "this behaviour is usually modelled by a sign - function and allows a simple macroscopic description for systems where solid - solid interactions are important , e.g. as for stick - slip dynamics @xcite .",
    "adding noise to the dynamical equations of a piecewise - smooth system opens a whole new area of research , which is still in its infancy .",
    "the interplay of dry friction and random forces has been reported in @xcite .",
    "exact solutions are known for a few piecewise - smooth stochastic models , where e.g. the propagator can be obtained for the case of pure dry friction @xcite or in connection with laplace transforms @xcite .",
    "other analytical results are available in the framework of path integrals and weak noise approximations @xcite or first passage time problems @xcite .",
    "whereas the aforementioned studies are dealing with gaussian white noise , models with non - gaussian noise and dry friction have been investigated as well @xcite .",
    "the features of systems with dry friction subjected to random forces have also been observed in experimental set - ups @xcite . from a more rigorous mathematical point of view",
    ", the influence of a stochastic perturbation to a piecewise - smooth dynamical system has been considered in @xcite .",
    "whenever the characteristic timescale of the underlying dynamical system is large compared to correlation effects of the noise , a gaussian white noise is sufficient to describe the impact of random perturbations .",
    "however , if the correlation time of the noise is of the same order as the characteristic timescale of the system a correlated noise ( or coloured noise ) is required @xcite . analytical treatments of coloured noise are considerably hampered by the lack of detailed balance and an effective higher dimensional phase space . in this context",
    "the so - called unified coloured noise approximation ( ucna ) has been developed by jung and hnggi to obtain analytical expressions for stationary probability densities @xcite .",
    "coloured noise has been studied in many different research areas , e.g. magnetic resonance systems @xcite or neurodynamics @xcite .",
    "the purpose of our contribution is twofold .",
    "we want to investigate the impact of noise on piecewise - smooth dynamical systems in a simple setup which still allows for a partial analytic treatment .",
    "furthermore , the proper nonequilibrium aspects with lack of detailed balance , the occurrence of stationary probability currents , and potential transition phenomena will be a crucial part of our investigations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec:2 ] introduces the pure dry friction model with coloured noise and we present the main features of this system . in section [ sec:3 ] the stationary behaviour of the model is investigated with the goal to find analytical expressions for the stationary probability density in one dimension and for the equivalent two - dimensional model ; this is supported by numerical simulations of the density as of the stationary probability current .",
    "dynamical properties as the power spectral density and the distributions of sliding and sticking events are elaborated in section [ sec:4 ] and we conclude our studies in section [ sec:5 ] .",
    "we consider here the simplest two - dimensional case of a piecewise - smooth stochastic system , which does not obey detailed balance . to motivate our considerations let us recall the one - dimensional motion of a particle subjected to white noise .",
    "with a slight abuse of notation the corresponding langevin equation governing the velocity reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes a white gaussian noise with correlation function @xmath2 and @xmath3 contains the deterministic part caused by coulomb friction .",
    "here we have adopted units such that the noise intensity and the dry friction coefficient have been normalised to one , a case which can be always achieved by a suitable rescaling . to some extent eq.([eq:2a ] ) is not well defined at @xmath4 .",
    "one could cure such an inconsistency by considering the coulomb friction as the limiting case of the regular drift @xmath5 for @xmath6 .",
    "such niceties are not relevant for eq.([eq:2a ] ) as the white noise is not a function with well defined finite values and the stochastic model in a strict sense is not pointwise defined .",
    "nevertheless the formally written down fokker - planck equation with suitable matching conditions ensuring continuity of the density and continuity of the probability current captures all aspects of the dynamics and has been studied intensely in the literature , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the deterministic part without noise requires a more careful approach in terms of piecewise - smooth dynamical systems @xcite , in particular , in the presence of a finite amplitude driving force where stick - slip transitions occur .",
    "an obvious extension of the model described above , leading towards a two - dimensional stochastic nonequilibrium system , consists in studying the effect of coloured noise . to be precise",
    "we intend to replace the gaussian white noise by an exponentially correlated ornstein - uhlenbeck process @xmath7 , which is governed by the stochastic differential equation @xmath8 the noise correlation time @xmath9 will be the only effective parameter in our model . since the process @xmath7 can be viewed as a continuous function some care is needed when introducing the dynamics of the particle . for forces smaller than the dry friction coefficient , @xmath10 , and @xmath4",
    "the particle will stick while otherwise the sliding dynamics is still described by the aforementioned equation of motion .",
    "+ thus we end up with @xmath11 alternatively we could use the regularized drift @xmath12 and consider results finally in the limit @xmath13 . we will adopt both views throughout our exposition while we will , at the same time , avoid the considerably technical difficulties that would be related with a rigorous approach .",
    "since we consider a noise with finite correlation time but a damping which does not involve a memory kernel , the system violates detailed balance and describes a nonequilibrium process @xcite .    before we enter a more detailed discussion",
    "let us just illustrate the main phenomenon by time traces obtained from numerical simulations .",
    "throughout all our numerical investigations we apply an euler - maruyama scheme with step size @xmath14 for different values of @xmath15 and using the following condition to take the discontinuity caused by dry friction into account ( see eq.([eq:2c ] ) ) : for @xmath16 and @xmath17 , we set @xmath18 , as the particle sticks in this case at the origin and the force @xmath7 is not large enough to move it .",
    "time traces from the simulations are shown in figures [ fig:2a ] - [ fig:2c ] . at a scale of order one the effect of dry friction becomes visible for correlation times larger than @xmath19 .",
    "the particle sticks for considerable amounts of time at @xmath4 , as the stochastic force @xmath7 is not large enough to move the particle .",
    "it is this stick - slip phenomenon and the related intermittent motion which will be somehow at the centre of our studies , being the key signature of our piecewise smooth stochastic model .",
    "similar results as the features of this intermittent dynamics for high noise correlation times ( see figure [ fig:2a ] ) have been found in studies on dry friction and non - gaussian noise in the high friction limit @xcite and in an experiment of a rotating probe subjected to a granular gas in the so called rare collision limit @xcite .",
    "given the previous reasoning and the numerical findings we expect the stationary density to exhibit a singular component caused by particles sticking at @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding stationary distribution is thus expected to consist of a dirac @xmath20 component at vanishing velocities and @xmath10 , and a regular part describing moving particles with finite velocities .",
    "the analysis will be further hampered by the lack of detailed balance so that closed form analytical expressions are unlikely to be available .      to make some analytical headway",
    "let us first have a look at the marginal velocity distribution @xmath21 for which perturbative treatments in terms of the correlation time are available .",
    "we are interested in possible changes and similarities compared to the case of white noise for @xmath22 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we apply the unified coloured noise approximation ( ucna ) , developed by jung and hnggi @xcite , to our regularized system eqs.([eq:2b ] ) and ( [ eq:2d ] ) .",
    "this method can be seen as a kind of interpolation scheme for systems with coloured noise , as this method shows , under certain conditions , exact results in the limit of vanishing correlation @xmath23 and high correlation @xmath24 .    for the convenience of the reader , we recall the main steps of the derivation of the stationary probability density @xmath25 .",
    "if we eliminate the variable @xmath26 from eqs.([eq:2d ] ) and ( [ eq:2b ] ) we obtain the second order equation @xmath27 we introduce a new time scale @xmath28 , @xmath29 where we have the damping factor @xmath30 this factor approaches infinity for both limits @xmath23 and @xmath24 . hence , the setup is suitable for an adiabatic elimination scheme in the limit of small correlation times .",
    "if we neglect the second order derivative we obtain a simpler multiplicative stochastic process @xmath31 with a corresponding fokker - planck equation in the stratonovich sense @xmath32 since the adiabatic approximation has reduced the problem to a one - dimensional fokker planck equation the stationary distribution can be computed by straightforward integration @xmath33 in the dry friction limit @xmath13 the normalised stationary probability density reads @xmath34",
    "eq.([eq:2 m ] ) shows that the stationary probability density consists of two parts , a regular contribution for @xmath35 and a singular part for @xmath18 . the delta contribution in the density",
    "reflects the fact that the particle sticks at @xmath4 when the stochastic force is not large enough to move the particle .",
    "the regular part of the density describes the sliding motion of the particle for @xmath35 . by taking the white noise limit @xmath23 we arrive at the exact stationary probability density for dry friction with white noise ( i.e. @xcite ) . for high correlation times",
    "@xmath9 the sliding contribution decreases and the density is mainly determined by the delta peak .",
    "thus , by increasing @xmath9 we can observe a gradual transition from sliding to sticking motion .",
    "the appearance of a delta peak in the expression for the stationary probability density has also been found in studies on non - gaussian noise @xcite and experiments @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the perturbative approach can be confirmed by direct numerical simulations , see figure [ fig:2c ] for the comparison of the ucna with direct numerical simulations . by taking at about 100 realisations of time traces of length @xmath36 ,",
    "we observe good agreement for small correlation times .",
    "however , for values @xmath37 , deviations between numerics and analytics become visible .    .",
    "the black dots correspond to numerical simulations of eqs.([eq:2b ] ) and ( [ eq:2c ] ) , the red line corresponds to eq.([eq:2m1]).,scaledwidth=43.0% ]    in addition to the analysis of sliding events , eqs.([eq:2k ] ) and ( [ eq:2 m ] ) give as well an estimate for the singular part , in particular for the probability of sticking as a function of the noise correlation @xmath38 to obtain this result one needs to integrate the regularized version of the singular part over a small area around @xmath4 .",
    "+ figure [ fig:2d ] shows the comparison of the analytical approximation with the simulations and we observe a quite well agreement as the probability of sticking increases with increasing @xmath9 and approaches the value @xmath39 in the limit of high correlation times .",
    "overall , the analytic approximation seems to work rather well , especially for small @xmath9 .",
    "deviations become visible when the noise correlation time increases further ( see figure [ fig:2c ] for the case @xmath40 ) . to explain the deviations between the analytical approximation and the direct numerical simulations for the regular part / sliding events ( figure [ fig:2c ] )",
    ", we need to take a look for the conditions of validity of the ucna ; this approximation gives proper results for the case @xmath41 .",
    "but for higher values of @xmath9 , this approximation fails as in our case the contribution caused by the dry friction vanishes in the limit @xmath6 , i.e. , when considering the piecewise linear case .",
    "nevertheless , this analytic approximation scheme provides very useful information of the underlying nonequilibrium dynamics of our model .      to get deeper insight into the dynamics of our model , we study the two - dimensional equations of motion ( [ eq:2b ] ) and ( [ eq:2c ] ) with the aim to understand properties of the stationary probability density @xmath42 .    to begin with",
    "we perform numerical simulations of the dynamics of eqs.([eq:2b ] ) and ( [ eq:2c ] ) ( see above for details of the numerical integration scheme ) .",
    "density plots on a logarithmic scale of the full stationary distribution ( regular and singular part ) are shown in figure [ fig:2e ] .",
    "for @xmath43 the singular part hardly matters and results are almost indistinguishable from the white noise case within the resolution of our simulations .",
    "the regular density shows a gaussian profile in the @xmath26 direction as well as exponential decay in the @xmath44 direction . by increasing @xmath9 ,",
    "the density changes significantly as the singular part becomes noticeable ( cf .",
    "eq.([eq:2 m ] ) and figure [ fig:2c ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the regular part of the density becomes asymmetric as the two components in the half spaces @xmath45 and @xmath46 are shifted against each other .",
    "+   +    for further analytical insight we try to formulate the corresponding fokker - planck system . using the regularized version of the equations of motion , eqs.([eq:2b ] ) and ( [ eq:2d ] )",
    ", the fokker - planck equation reads @xmath47 there is no obvious way to compute the stationary solution because detailed balance is violated .",
    "the marginal distribution for the noise amplitude is however easily computed as @xmath48 and does not depend on the regularisation .",
    "hence eq.([eq:2q ] ) applies as well in the dry friction limit @xmath6 , which does not come as a surprise ( cf .",
    "eq.([eq:2b ] ) ) . in the dry friction limit",
    "the expression @xmath49 formally solves the stationary fokker - planck equation , see eq.([eq:2n ] ) in the limit @xmath6 , as long as @xmath44 is nonzero .",
    "it differs from the regular part of the marginal ( eq.([eq:2 m ] ) ) by the sign of the mixed @xmath50 term .",
    "certainly eq.([eq:2o ] ) does not provide an analytic solution for the stationary density as eq.([eq:2o ] ) does not obey the required matching conditions at @xmath4 . nevertheless , if the impact of the stick - slip phenomenon at @xmath4 remains localised then eq.([eq:2o ] ) provides the asymptotic behaviour for large values of velocities .",
    "in fact , this assertion can be verified by looking into the numerical data . in figure [ fig:2h ] slices of the regular density taken at constant values of the velocity show deviations from the gaussian profile close to the singular component , i.e. , at low velocities .",
    "however , the gaussian profile according to eq.([eq:2o ] ) is restored when we increase the velocity , i.e. , at regions in phase space further away from the sticking region .",
    "deviations from the gaussian profile or strictly speaking the asymmetry of the distribution in @xmath26 direction can also be observed in figure [ fig:2e ] ( bottom ) for a high noise correlation @xmath9 .",
    "a similar feature is displayed by slices taken at constant noise level , see figure [ fig:2l ] .",
    "the singular part of the distribution , that means the dynamics of sticking particles is entirely governed by eq.([eq:2b ] ) , that means by the fokker - planck equation of the ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "however , natural boundary conditions and source terms do not apply as particles perform stick - slip transitions .    for the singular part of the density at @xmath4 we have already indicted that increasing the correlation time results in a considerable decrease of the probability of sliding particles . as a result",
    "the main contribution to the marginal distribution , eq.([eq:2q ] ) , will come from the density at @xmath4 as , apart from an exponentially small contribution , particles become immobile . in fact , that is in quantitative agreement with direct simulations , see figure [ fig:2 g ] . for small values of the correlation time considerable deviations from the normal distribution",
    "appear as on the one hand particles become mobile frequently and on the other hand there is a constant stream of mobile particles getting stuck ( see as well figure [ fig:2a ] ) .",
    "in the region of the phase space close to the stick - slip transition the shape of the distribution is affected at intermediate values of the noise correlation .",
    "there is no obvious way to tackle the issue by analytical means , e.g. , with the matching conditions between the singular and the regular part .",
    "but one can at least have a closer look at the probability current which is a clear signature of the nonequilibrium properties of our model . by using the method from @xcite we",
    "compute the probability current directly from the time series of our model ( eqs.([eq:2b]),([eq:2c ] ) ) for different values of @xmath9 , see figures [ fig:2i ] and [ fig:2j ] .",
    "we can see the following behaviour of the probability current : the entire flow pattern is symmetric , and the main part of the current is concentrated in regions with low velocity @xmath44 . for @xmath51 the current predominantly points in the positive @xmath44-direction as particles are dragged by the external forcing . for larger positive values of @xmath44 the current turns and finally approaches the sticking manifold @xmath4 , @xmath10 , where particles change from sliding to sticking mode . as the stationary probability current is , by definition , solenoidal ( see eq.([eq:2n ] ) ) the current on the sticking manifold becomes large and points in the positive or negative direction , see figure [ fig:2k ] .",
    "when reaching the critical value @xmath52 particles start sliding again . in particular , the current on the sticking manifold @xmath4 and @xmath10 and the current entering or leaving this manifold obey matching conditions .",
    "hence , for the piecewise - smooth dynamics one can write down a system of two coupled fokker - planck equations , one governing the sticking and one governing the sliding motion , with appropriate matching conditions and source terms .",
    "it is however not obvious whether such a formulation for the regular and the singular component of the probability distribution would give more insight than direct numerical simulations of the associated langevin equation , let along providing a pathway for an analytical approach .",
    "figure [ fig:2k ] indicates a non - monotonic behaviour of the current by varying the correlation time of the noise @xmath9 : for low values of @xmath9 , the current is very small , as we are close to the white noise limit . by increasing @xmath9 the current increases as well up to a value close to @xmath53 .",
    "increasing @xmath9 further the current is decreasing and almost vanishing , see the results for @xmath54 in figure [ fig:2k ] . for higher values of the noise correlation",
    "the probability current decays rapidly outside of the interval @xmath55 . in view of the particular structure of the stationary density",
    "this is hardly surprising , as the singular component of the density dominates for high correlation times , the dynamics is dominated by sticking particles , and only a small part of the probability density contributes to the sliding motion and finally to the probability current .",
    "traditional correlation functions are a useful tool to study dynamical properties , in particular , within the context of linear response theories . from a theoretical perspective their analytical properties",
    "are related with the eigenvalue spectrum of the underlying equations of motion , e.g. with the spectrum of fokker - planck operators .",
    "furthermore correlation functions are experimentally accessible and they allow to introduce the concept of correlation times . as a shortcoming correlation functions",
    "may not allow for the proper characterisation of intermittent behaviour , such as stick - slip transitions , which needs then to be addressed separately by a suitable statistical analysis .      to begin with , we want to investigate how the correlation time of the noise @xmath9 influences the correlations in our system . to be slightly more precise we will discuss the @xmath9-dependence of the power spectral density of the velocity @xmath44 , and the corresponding linewidth .",
    "the latter provides insight into the structure of the eigenvalue spectrum of an underlying fokker planck operator governing the dynamics of the system . for the dry friction model with white noise , @xmath56 ,",
    "a spectral gap between the two first eigenvalues has been observed @xcite . in @xcite",
    "a closed expression for the power spectral density of the velocity has been derived based on the laplace transform of the propagator .    for noise with finite correlation time",
    "we mainly rely on numerical investigations since analytic expression for the stationary probability density are unknown .",
    "hence , we calculate the power spectral density of the variable @xmath44 by averaging over 800 numerically generated time traces of length @xmath57 .",
    "we base our analysis on the autocorrelations of the velocity .",
    "hence , the corresponding power spectral density predominantly probes properties of the sliding phase as velocities vanish in the sticking phase .",
    "figure [ fig:3b ] shows the numerical results of the normalised spectral densities for different values of @xmath9 .",
    "the normalised power spectral densities @xmath58 have a single central peak at @xmath59 indicating an exponential decay of the corresponding autocorrelation function . for small values of @xmath9 , and in accordance with the white noise limit , @xmath58 is a lorentzian with power law behaviour @xmath60 at an intermediate frequency range .",
    "such decay changes when increasing the noise correlation time @xmath9 , resulting in a decay proportional to @xmath61 at medium frequencies .",
    "the corresponding analytic behaviour indicates a smooth autocorrelation function at time zero .",
    "the complex valued singularities of the power spectral density are signatures of the the non - vanishing eigenvalue of an underlying fokker planck operator . for power",
    "spectral densities with a well defined central peak , the full width at half maximum @xmath62 can be related to the correlation time of the system @xmath63 via the wiener - khinchin theorem . following results for linear stochastic processes",
    "we define here a correlation time by @xmath64 . using a fit function of the form @xmath65 for the power spectral densities",
    "@xmath58 we evaluate the correlation time , see fig .",
    "[ fig:3c ] .",
    "the correlation time @xmath63 essentially coincides with the value of the white noise limit as long as @xmath66 .",
    "while there is no sharp transition , @xmath63 significantly increases monotonically when the noise correlation time exceeds a `` critical '' value of @xmath67 .",
    "hence , signatures of the stick - slip transition become dynamically visible above such a critical value .",
    "the transition - like feature is in accordance with the findings about the stationary density reported in the previous section , e.g. see figure [ fig:2d ] .",
    "the time traces shown in figures [ fig:2a ] - [ fig:2b1 ] suggest a closer relation of the dynamics with intermittency phenomena .",
    "thus , to probe directly the dynamical features of the stick - slip transition we look at the distribution of sticking and sliding times , i.e. , the distribution of time intervals the particle spends in states @xmath4 and @xmath68 .",
    "+ we start our investigations with the analysis of the sticking time events . as the dynamics of sticking particles is mainly determined by the exit time problem of the ornstein - uhlenbeck process , see eq.([eq:2b ] ) , this problem can be treated by analytical means , which can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "the laplace transform of the exit time probability density for an ornstein - uhlenbeck process like eq.([eq:2b ] ) with symmetric absorbing boundaries ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) and a fixed initial condition @xmath71 reads @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the parabolic cylinder function , @xmath74 denotes kummer s confluent hypergeometric function and we have used some identities for these functions @xcite . we set @xmath75 as the regime , where particles are sticking , is the interval @xmath76 , integrate over all possible initial conditions @xmath77 within this regime , assuming a uniform distribution for the initial conditions , and we obtain @xmath78 as it is not possible to obtain an analytical result for the inverse laplace transform of this expression , we use the talbot method to calculate the exit time distribution numerically @xcite .",
    "the results for certain values of @xmath9 are shown in figures [ fig:4a ] - [ fig:4c ] .",
    "one observes a localised peak in the distribution at @xmath79 , and for moderate to large times a simple exponential decay . for higher noise correlation times the exponential decay of the distribution becomes smaller , as it becomes more likely for particles to stick at @xmath4 , which is in accordance to the results in the previous sections .",
    "our numerical findings for the exit time distribution agree very well with the analytical estimate , i.e. the inverse laplace transform of eq.([eq:2r ] ) .",
    "it works particularly well for large values of @xmath9 and fails to be valid if we approach the transition value @xmath67 as stick - slip phenomena become just noticeable around this value .    for the remainder of this section we now focus on the statistics of the sliding events .",
    "figures [ fig:4e ] and [ fig:4f ] show the numerically obtained distributions over a wide range of noise correlation times . for small noise correlation distributions",
    "are unimodal with kind of a power law decay at an intermediate range .",
    "for a larger noise correlation the distributions develop a maximum at a finite time - so that the most probable sliding time becomes finite .",
    "figure [ fig:4f ] indicates a kind of universal behaviour of the distributions at long sliding times @xmath80 for large correlation times @xmath9 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the distributions found here shows a stunning similarity to characteristics of on - off intermittency @xcite as the power law decay is of the form @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "however , in the context of our model the role of the `` on '' and of the `` off '' state are somehow interchanged as this universal behaviour is assigned to the dynamics , which sticks in the chaotic attractor .",
    "looking for an analytically treatable counterpart , the problem of the sliding events could be related to an exit time problem with constant drift and coloured noise , which is hard to tackle for analytical results . for gaussian white noise and constant drift this problem",
    "can be solved analytically @xcite , and the exit time distribution shows a @xmath83 behaviour ; thus the universal power - law decay of @xmath81 appears here as well .",
    "we investigated a pure dry friction model subjected to coloured noise with emphasis to elaborate the stationary and dynamical behaviour in terms of probability densities . by applying the unified coloured noise approximation ( ucna )",
    ", we obtained an analytical expression of the stationary probability density for the velocity .",
    "in the white noise limit @xmath23 , we got the known result for dry friction and white noise , e.g. see @xcite .",
    "as the noise correlation time increases , a delta peak emerges in the stationary density for the velocity , as particles become more and more stuck at @xmath18 . by varying @xmath9 a transition form sliding to sticking dynamics could be observed .",
    "considering the equivalent two - dimensional system , we were able to derive an asymptotic expression for the stationary density for high velocities and high noise levels , far away from the stick - slip region .",
    "unfortunately there was no obvious way to obtain a full analytic expression for the joint probability density @xmath42 containing all the required matching conditions at @xmath18 as detailed balance is violated .",
    "the latter can be shown by computing the stationary probability current , which does not vanish .",
    "furthermore we studied the power spectral density for the @xmath44 variable numerically to obtain information about the velocity correlations or strictly speaking the first non - vanishing eigenvalue of the spectrum of the fokker - planck operator .",
    "below a `` critical value '' one recovers the result for white noise . increasing the noise correlation further ,",
    "the full width at half maximum decreases , which is connected to a higher velocity correlation in the system . another feature of the spectral density by varying @xmath9 was the changing shape : in the white noise limit or for low values of @xmath9 the density is a lorentzian . for values @xmath37",
    "the shape changes to a quartic spectral density with a @xmath84 decay for intermediate frequencies .    to complete our studies",
    ", we investigated the sliding and sticking time distribution as the time traces indicated a connection to intermittent type dynamics . whereas results for the sticking time distribution were accessible via the exit time problem for an ornstein - uhlenbeck process with symmetric absorbing boundary conditions , we had to rely on numerics for the the sliding dynamics as the connected exit time problem with coloured noise and a constant drift is hard to tackle for analytic expressions . for high noise correlation times",
    ", we observed an exponential decay of the form @xmath81 , which appears as well in the context of on - off intermittency .    the paradigmatic study of a piecewise smooth stochastic nonequilibrium model offers the potential to confirm the predicted signatures of the stick slip behaviour , e.g. a critical noise correlation time and on - off intermittency characteristics in experimental setups where coulomb friction is predominant and the time scale is comparable to the correlations of stochastic perturbations .",

    "<S> we investigate the impact of noise on a two - dimensional simple paradigmatic piecewise - smooth dynamical system . for that purpose </S>",
    "<S> we consider the motion of a particle subjected to dry friction and coloured noise . </S>",
    "<S> the finite correlation time of the noise provides an additional dimension in phase space , a nontrivial probability current , and thus establishes a proper nonequilibrium regime . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the finite noise correlation time allows for the study of stick - slip phenomena which show up as a singular component in the stationary probability density . </S>",
    "<S> analytic insight can be provided by application of the unified coloured noise approximation , developed by jung and hnggi @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of probability currents and a closer look at power spectral densities underpin the observed stick - slip transitions which are related with a critical value of the noise correlation time . </S>"
