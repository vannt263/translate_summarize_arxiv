    "@xmath5 is given by @xmath95 the fact that it is constant shows that the dilution from the expansion of the universe is exactly compensated by the particles created from schwinger and gravitational particle creation .",

    "the limit to flat minkowski spacetime is presented in ( [ m4 ] ) and agrees with the usual expression for the schwinger effect .",
    "+ going beyond the semiclassical limit is possible but is out of the scope of this paper . to do",
    "this one can compute a more general quantity : the fermionic induced current .",
    "the current is proportional to the number of pairs created in the semiclassical limit but allows to explore a regime where the notion of adiabatic vacuum and of particles does not necessarily exist .",
    "it is a more precise way of describing the schwinger effect because its definition does not depend on the time of creation of the pairs and the rough estimate ( [ estimate ] ) can be avoided .",
    "a calculation of the current induced by an electric field in @xmath1 is performed in @xcite . + throughout this paper the electric and gravitational fields have been assumed to be external sources .",
    "one of the next steps could be to consider backreaction effects of the newly created particles to the external electric and gravitational fields .",
    "to do so , for the electromagnetic side , the electric current needs to be computed and be plugged into the equivalent of the maxwell equation in curved spacetime . for the gravitational side , the density of particle needs to be plugged in the friedman equation .",
    "another direction could be to look for cosmological application _",
