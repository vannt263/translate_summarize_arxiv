    "in this note we sketch a technique for determining the existence and uniqueness of groundstates of supersymmetric matrix models with global symmetry , subject to dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "we consider one of the simplest possible benchmark models available .",
    "this allows us to illustrate the actual procedure on a concrete setting .",
    "the hamiltonian , given by ( [ hamil ] ) , is the canonical toy model which is often used to test spectral properties of the @xmath2 supermembrane . in the following we call it the @xmath0-model .",
    "we believe the approach we present below is new in the context of matrix models and its scope of applicability includes a wide range of physical settings .",
    "wavefunctions of matrix models have been investigated by means of different methods in the past .",
    "they provide a better understanding of m - theory , either from the point of view of supermembrane theory @xcite or from the point of view of other matrix models @xcite .",
    "they also play a role in supersymmetric yang - mills theories in the slow - mode regime @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-model was first introduced in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that zero is not an eigenvalue .",
    "numerical tests carried out in @xcite suggest the existence of more general weyl - type wavefunctions . see also @xcite .",
    "we now show analytically that the inhomogeneous boundary value problem associated to a zero eigenvalue for dirchlet boundary conditions on a compact domain @xmath3 has a solution which is unique .",
    "see ( [ bvp])-([bc ] ) . without loss of generality",
    "we assume that @xmath3 is a two - dimensional ball of finite radius @xmath4 .",
    "the supersymmetric hamiltonian to be considered is @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the supersymmetric charges in this case are given by the expression @xmath7 the wavefunctions are @xmath8 .",
    "note they are subject to zero boundary conditions , @xmath9",
    "the resolvent of @xmath10 is compact , so the inhomogeneous system @xmath11 for regular enough right hand side @xmath12 will have a unique solution if and only if zero is not an eigenvalue of @xmath10 .",
    "we show that this is indeed the case .",
    "assume that @xmath13 then @xmath14 according to the regularity properties of the elliptic operators , @xmath10 in this case , this condition holds true pointwise up to the boundary of @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath15 and denote by @xmath16 the components of the normal to @xmath17 at @xmath18 .",
    "the tangent to @xmath17 at @xmath18 is then @xmath19 and we must have @xmath20    the solution of problem ( [ zero ] ) is regular , so we can extend it continuously up to the boundary . then ( [ vanishingboth ] ) yields @xmath21 pointwise . since @xmath22 , if @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 a similar conclusion is obtained for @xmath26 .",
    "hence @xmath27 and @xmath28 must vanish on the boundary @xmath17 .",
    "now , by virtue of the cauchy - kovalewski theorem , cf .",
    "@xcite , and from the fact that the potential is analytic , we conclude that @xmath29 pointwise on the whole of @xmath30 .",
    "that is , the only solution to ( [ zero ] ) is the zero wavefunction .    in a paper",
    "soon to be completed @xcite , we will examine the existence and uniqueness of the solution of boundary value problems associated to the @xmath31 regularized model of the @xmath2 supermembrane on a bounded domain .",
    "this theory was introduced in @xcite for an unbounded domain .",
    "we expect to being able to examine the existence of massless groundstates in supersymmetric matrix models with global and gauge symmetries .",
    "the @xmath0-model @xcite is a well - known benchmark for testing spectral properties of the @xmath2 supermembrane .",
    "the existence of a groundstate was analyzed in @xcite by considering the whole space @xmath1 . in the latter case",
    "the model does not admit a solution @xcite . we have considered this system confined to a ball of finite radius . in this case zero",
    "is also not an eigenvalue for the space of wavefunctions which on the boundary .",
    "additionally we show that the inhomogeneous boundary value problem associated to zero eigenvalue has always a solution which is unique .",
    "we consider a viewpoint to determine the existence of groundstate wavefunctions which we believe is new in the context of matrix models .",
    "the conditions of supersymmetry and ellipticity of the hamiltonian operator are essential to this analysis .",
    "the results announced in this note can be further generalized to more interesting settings . a rigorous general framework in this respect is currently being consider @xcite .",
