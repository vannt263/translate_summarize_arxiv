    "neutral hydrogen ( hi ) absorption measurements of pulsar signals at @xmath9 cm are important probes of various properties of the interstellar medium such as the small - scale structure of of cold hi @xcite and calibrators of the pulsar distance scale and electron density models at large galactic distances @xcite .",
    "these measurements are complementary to interferometrically determined parallaxes , which can be utilized on nearer sources @xcite .",
    "we report new arecibo hi absorption observations of eight pulsars , and we use these measurements to study the electron density of the interstellar medium and the small - scale structure of neutral hydrogen clouds .",
    "sensitivity limitations indicate that few if any additional pulsar hi absorption measurements of electron density in the galactic plane at the intermediate first - quadrant galactic longitudes accessible to the arecibo telescope will be made in the next decade or so .",
    "hence it is an appropriate time to combine the new results with all previous pulsar hi measurements at these longitudes to globally assess the density in the galactic plane in this region .",
    "we will use this information to estimate the distance to the relativistic binary pulsar b1913 + 16 .",
    "in addition , hi absorption measurements on some of our high - latitude pulsars were originally measured over twenty years ago , during which interval the pulsars have moved many au through the interstellar medium . hence comparison of the old and new absorption spectra yields information on the small scale structure of the absorbing neutral hydrogen .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : the pulsar hi absorption observational technique is sketched in the next section (  2 ) .",
    "we present hi absorption spectra and kinematic distance results for low - latitude pulsars in  3 . in  4",
    ", we use all measured pulsar distances in the inner galactic plane visible from arecibo observatory to analyze the electron density in that region . in  4.1 , we review the latest work on the galactocentric distance of the sun and the orbital velocity of the local standard of rest in order to select an optimum model to use in refining pulsar kinematic distances and galactic electron densities .",
    "then in  4.2 , we apply the results of  4 and  4.1 to determine the distance of the relativistic binary pulsar psr b1913 + 16 .",
    "we provide absorption spectra of high - latitude pulsars in  5 , along with analyses of time - variability of absorption in those cases where earlier epoch data are available .",
    "finally , we discuss our conclusions in  6 .",
    "all observations were made with the 305-m arecibo telescope from 1998 to 2000 .",
    "the radio frequency signals near 1420 mhz were mixed to baseband , sampled , and recorded with the caltech baseband recorder @xcite , a 10 mhz bandwidth , fast - sampling receiver backend .",
    "every 100 ns , the cbr sampled complex voltages with four - level digitization from the two orthogonally polarized feed channels , and recorded the samples to tape for later processing .",
    "( for additional details of the observing techniques and equipment , see stanimirovi ' c et al [ 2003a , b ] ) .",
    "the data were then corrected for quantization @xcite , fourier transformed and folded modulo the apparent pulsar period with the supercomputers of caltech s center for advanced computing research , resulting in data cubes consisting of intensity as a function of pulsar rotational phase ( 128 phase bins ) and radio frequency ( 2048 frequency channels , each having 1 km / s width ) .",
    "subsequent processing at carleton college collapsed the data cubes into two spectra : the pulsar-_on _ spectrum is a sum of the spectra gathered during the pulsar pulse weighted by @xmath10 , while the sum of those gathered in the interval between pulses is called the pulsar-_off _ spectrum . here",
    "@xmath11 is the broadband pulsar intensity in a given pulse phase bin @xmath12 .",
    "two final spectra are formed and displayed for each pulsar .",
    "the pulsar _ absorption _ spectrum , which represents the spectrum of the pulsar alone less any absorption caused by intervening neutral hydrogen , is the normalized difference of the pulsar-_on _ and -_off _ spectra . in order to maximize sensitivity ,",
    "multiple integrations are summed with a weight depending on the square of the pulsar signal strength @xmath13 during each integration . in some cases ,",
    "additional sensitivity was achieved by hanning smoothing the final absorption spectrum , yielding a resolution of 2 km / s .",
    "( any absorption spectrum that has been hanning smoothed is labelled as such when displayed below . ) the hi _ emission _ spectrum is the time - integrated , pulsar-_off _ spectrum , calibrated in brightness temperature units by matching its peak with the leiden / argentine / bonn hi survey @xcite .",
    "all spectra were frequency switched and low - order polynomials were fitted to and removed from them in some cases in order to flatten intrinsic or scintillation - induced bandpass ripples .",
    "the basic observing parameters are tabulated for low- and high - latitude pulsars in the early columns of tables 1 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the quantities @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the system temperature and measured 1-@xmath16 noise in optical depth away from the hi line , are both given .",
    "the former value is the sum of an estimated 40 k receiver contribution , plus a sky background determined by extrapolating the 408 mhz sky temperature @xcite at the pulsar position to 1420 mhz with a spectral index of -2.6 .",
    "the hi emission line itself contributes significantly to the system temperature ( and hence to the noise ) at those velocities where it is present . to determine the expected optical depth noise at any velocity @xmath17",
    ", one may use @xmath18/t_{sys,\\rm off - line}$ ] , where @xmath19 is the measured brightness temperature of hi at that velocity .",
    "a low - latitude pulsar hi absorption spectrum can be used to set limits on the pulsar s distance , using the `` kinematic '' technique .",
    "a pulsar is farther than an hi cloud that absorbs its signal , and closer than one that does _",
    "not_. the latter `` no absorption '' criterion is impossible to ascertain in real spectra because of the inevitable presence of noise which could mask weak absorption .",
    "however it was shown by @xcite that emission features with @xmath20 k almost always exhibit significant absorption of radiation from background objects .",
    "therefore subsequent investigators have assigned an upper distance limit only at the velocity where one finds both no significant absorption , _ and _ an emission feature of @xmath20 k. we use a flat @xcite galactic rotation model and the iau galactic constants of @xmath21 kpc and @xmath22 km / s @xcite to convert the radial velocities to distance . the resulting model radial velocities are shown in a panel under each absorption / emission spectrum pair . we also add and subtract velocities of 7 km / s to our nominal velocities , in order to derive estimates of the uncertainties in distance limits due to streaming and random gas motions in the galaxy .",
    "these procedures are identical to those used in the critical evaluation of all such measurements then extant by @xcite , and by all subsequent pulsar hi absorption experimenters .",
    "hence our results are directly intercomparable with these earlier ones .",
    "our derived distance limits are discussed below for each pulsar , and are summarized in table 1 .",
    "see  4.1 for a discussion of modifications to our derived distances for different values of the galactic constants .",
    "the farthest observed absorption feature is at @xmath23 km / s , well before the tangent point .",
    "hence the pulsar lies beyond a lower distance limit of @xmath24 kpc .",
    "unfortunately the hi emission has @xmath25 k at all velocities where one might test for an upper distance limit via lack of absorption , because the @xmath26 line of sight rapidly leaves the hydrogen layer .",
    "since significant absorption could not in any case be guaranteed at the velocity of such weak emission @xcite , no upper distance limit can be set .",
    "@xcite observed this pulsar .",
    "their hi spectrum was contaminated by interstellar scintillation and was rather noisy , prompting us to reobserve it with greater sensitivity . the highest velocity absorption that @xcite could confidently detect was at @xmath27 km / s , leading to their limit of @xmath28 kpc ) @xmath29 .",
    "our new observations clearly exhibit absorption at @xmath30 km / s , near the tangent point .",
    "hence we revise the lower distance limit significantly upwards : @xmath31 kpc ) @xmath29 .",
    "the @xcite spectrum also showed an absorption feature at this velocity but it was not sufficiently above the noise to serve as a reliable kinematic distance indicator .",
    "the dip in the current absorption spectrum at @xmath32 km / s is probably noise and will not be used to set a distance limit .",
    "( it appears much more prominently in one of the two circular polarization channels than in the other , and is not visible in the @xcite absorption spectrum .",
    "furthermore , the nearby source g55.6 + 2.3=b1923 + 210 does not exhibit reliable far side absorption until @xmath33 km / s [ dickey et al 1983 ; colgan et al 1988 ] . )",
    "conversely , the _ lack _ of absorption in the @xmath34 k emission feature at @xmath35 km / s sets the upper distance limit of @xmath36 pc .      while the fich et al .",
    "model predicts a tangent point velocity of 48 km / s in this direction , we detect significant emission and absorption well beyond this velocity , with the last major feature centered near @xmath37 km / s .",
    "these features are due to the sagittarius arm @xcite . @xcite and @xcite also observe hi absorption out to these velocities in the nearby sources g50.625 - 0.031 and g51.4 - 0.0 , respectively .",
    "we choose the tangent point as our lower distance limit , so @xmath38 kpc @xmath29 .",
    "the lack of absorption in the @xmath39 k emission feature at @xmath40 km / s yields the upper distance limit : @xmath41 kpc",
    "the currently reported hi absorption distance measurements are probably among the last to be determined at arecibo in the foreseeable future , as all known pulsars having sufficient flux density to achieve adequate @xmath42 in a reasonable time have now been measured as well as is possible with this procedure .",
    "unfortunately galactic hi emission is now the dominant noise source , so that future receiver improvements will not significantly decrease the overall noise .",
    "therefore , new low - latitude pulsars discovered in the future in this longitude range will probably be too faint for the hi absorption technique , even at arecibo .",
    "consequently now is a good time to review all such measurements and their implications for the electron density in the inner galactic plane visible from arecibo .",
    "the dispersion measure @xmath43 of a pulsar , derived from multiple - frequency timing measurements and reported in @xcite , directly yields the path - integrated electron density along the line of sight : @xmath44 .",
    "hence our distance limits , @xmath45 , can be combined with the published dispersion measures to yield mean electron densities @xmath46 along the line of sight :    @xmath47    table 2 lists the electron density limits derived in this fashion from our measurements and from all earlier ones in similar directions ; i.e. , toward the inner galactic plane accessible to the arecibo telescope .",
    "note that the kinematic distances listed in table 2 were all derived with the standard procedures discussed above in  3 , namely the uniform criteria established by @xcite and the iau standard galactic constants @xcite .",
    "procedures to modify these values for other choices of galactic constants are given below in  4.1 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : density]a , we display measured limits on the mean electron density as a function of galactic longitude @xmath48 in the inner galactic plane visible from arecibo . only those pulsars from table 2 with @xmath49 and a lower distance limit @xmath50 kpc",
    "are included in fig .",
    "[ fig : density]a in order to concentrate on kpc - scale averages in the galactic plane .",
    "almost all of these measurements were derived from arecibo pulsar hi absorption spectra . while there is significant scatter",
    ", it is apparent that the measured densities tend to decline as the line of sight rotates away from the inner galaxy , with a notable drop in the region between the sagittarius arm ( the first arm interior to our location ) and the local spiral arm ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : galplane ] ) . @xcite",
    "were the first to have adequate @xmath46 measurements to infer that interarm densities are lower than those in spiral arms .",
    "as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : density]a , the numerous measurements made since that epoch serve to confirm and refine their suggestion , at least in this particular interarm region .",
    "indeed , the drop in @xmath46 as @xmath48 exceeds @xmath51 corresponds with the line of sight finally reaching a longitude where it no longer intercepts the sagittarius arm ( see fig . [",
    "fig : galplane ] ) .",
    "meanwhile , with only one exception , _ every _ pulsar measurement in the interarm range @xmath2 is consistent with a relatively low @xmath52 @xmath4 ( see below for further analysis ) . the electron density at lower latitudes sampled in fig .",
    "[ fig : density]a is clearly significantly higher , with an average in the vicinity of 0.05 @xmath4 ( plus superposed variations ) in the @xmath53 longitude range .",
    "it is also useful to compare our updated set of electron density measurements with the most widely used galactic density model ( ne2001 , cordes & lazio 2002 ) . fig .",
    "[ fig : density]b exhibits the measured limits on @xmath46 , normalized by the mean electron densities _ predicted _ by the ne2001 model .",
    "the measured - to - model electron density ratio hovers near 1 ( with some inevitable scatter ) for @xmath54 , indicating that the model fits the data adequately at those longitudes .",
    "however , at the higher longitudes @xmath2 discussed above , there is a tendency for the typical measured - to - model density ratio to lie below 1 , suggesting that the ne2001 model densities are somewhat high in this interarm region .    in order to further explore the electron density in this interarm region",
    ", we performed monte carlo simulations to assess the best value and uncertainty on @xmath46 and on the measured - to - model @xmath46 ratio for the pulsars in this region .",
    "of the ten pulsars with measured distance limits and limits on @xmath46 in this range ( see table 2 ) , we discarded the data from psr j1935 + 1616 since it lacks a measured upper distance and lower density limit .",
    "for each of the remaining nine pulsars , all possible distances between the measured upper and lower limits were rendered equally probable in our simulations by choosing distances randomly from a uniform distribution between the measured distance limits .",
    "note that the assumption of uniform probability is the simplest reasonable hypothesis for measurements such as these which have only a lower and upper limit .",
    "we find that @xmath55 ) ] @xmath4 , and that the ratio of measured - to - ne2001 electron density is @xmath5 for @xmath2 .",
    "future models should take this discrepancy into account .    for simplicity , both",
    "the measured and model densities discussed above are based on the standard iau galactic constants . as described below in  4.1 , the _ ratio _ plotted in fig . [ fig : density]b remains virtually identical if both constituents are rescaled to incorporate other choices of galactic constants .",
    "much progress has been made on galactic structure and kinematics in the @xmath56 years since the iau constants were defined .",
    "therefore it is useful to discuss improved measurements of @xmath0 and and @xmath1 , and to investigate the influence of these better values on the kinematic distances and electron densities discussed in  3 and  4 .    from remarkable proper motion and radial velocity measurements of the orbit of star s2 about sgr a * through much of its 15-yr period , @xcite find that the distance to the galactic center @xmath57 kpc . @xcite have made equally stunning interferometric measurements of the proper motion of sgr a * , which yield an angular velocity of the local standard of rest ( lsr ) about the galactic center , @xmath58 km s@xmath59 kpc@xmath59 .",
    "both of these measurements are notable in that they rest on far fewer assumptions than earlier determinations , and hence should be freer of systematic errors . consequently we adopt them in what follows .",
    "an even newer estimate of @xmath0 from infrared measurements of red clump giants in the galactic bulge @xcite yields a value of @xmath60 ( statistical ) @xmath61 ( systematic ) kpc , which is consistent with our above adopted value .",
    "consider material traversing a circular orbit in the plane at galactocentric radius @xmath62 .",
    "given a flat rotation curve with circular velocity @xmath1 , its radial velocity with respect to the lsr is @xmath63 . with @xmath64 , the distance as a function of @xmath65",
    "is given by    @xmath66    hence our new adopted galactic parameters , giving a small change in @xmath1 but a relatively large change in @xmath0 , result in a recalibration of the distance in a particular direction , accomplished by rescaling it with an approximately constant factor of @xmath67 .",
    "kinematic distance limits and galactic distance models that use the old iau galactic constants should be adjusted by this factor to reflect the improved constants .",
    "[ fig : rotcurve ] displays distance - radial velocity curves toward @xmath68 derived with the old and new flat galactic rotation curves . fig . [",
    "fig : rotcurve]a illustrates that the old and new model distances differ primarily by a constant multiplicative factor , as indicated in the previous analysis .",
    "it follows from the above , that when distance is _ normalized _ by @xmath0 , the old and new radial velocity - distance curves are almost identical ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rotcurve]b ) . such normalized distances are useful in the analysis of the acceleration of pulsars in the galactic gravitational field , as will be discussed in the next section (  4.2 ) .",
    "as described above , the new galactic constants would result primarily in the measured distances being rescaled by the ratio of new to old @xmath0 .",
    "the electron densities , including model densities that have been calibrated via pulsar kinematic distance measurements , would then be rescaled by the inverse of this ratio ( see eq .",
    "hence fig .",
    "[ fig : density]a would be thus rescaled ; while fig .",
    "[ fig : density]b would remain unchanged since it displays the ratio of two densities , each of which should be rescaled by the same factor .      the relativistic binary pulsar b1913 + 16 lies in the heart of the region of the galaxy that we are studying , at @xmath69 .",
    "the orbital decay of this system due to gravitational wave emission provides a strong test of relativistic gravitation @xcite .",
    "currently , the precision of the relativistic test is limited by uncertainties in the galactic acceleration of the pulsar and the solar system @xcite , which are currently dominated by uncertainties in the pulsar distance @xmath45 [ or more specifically , uncertainties in @xmath70 , the distance normalized by @xmath0 @xcite ] .",
    "hence it is very important to assess the current results in an effort to improve our knowledge of b1913 + 16 s distance .",
    "[ fig : density]a shows that the measured electron density appears to have a local minimum near the pulsar s longitude .",
    "the relatively low value of @xmath46 at @xmath71 is not surprising , since we noted in  4 that the line of sight in this direction traverses a long path _ between _ spiral arms ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : galplane ] ) .",
    "the tightest limits on @xmath46 in the whole inner plane visible from arecibo are for psr b1915 + 13 at @xmath72 , which happens also to be the pulsar closest to psr b1913 + 16 .",
    "hence we adopt the measured limits from b1915 + 13 , including an allowance for up to 7 km s@xmath59 non - circular velocities ( not shown in table 2 or fig .",
    "[ fig : density ] ) : @xmath73 note that this value is congruent with and has modestly tighter limits than the electon density derived in this interarm region in  4 .",
    "armed with our new estimate of @xmath46 , we use equation 1 to find the distance to psr b1913 + 16 , which has @xmath74 pc @xmath4 : @xmath75 kpc .",
    "our result can also be compared with the @xcite ne2001 model distance of @xmath76 kpc , which is lower for the reasons discussed above .",
    "@xcite used techniques similar to ours to estimate that @xmath77 . while the error bars of their and our estimates overlap significantly , we are not able to justify tightening them to the degree that @xcite did . finally , adopting what we judged in  4.1 to be the current best measurement of @xmath78 kpc ; eisenhauer et al .",
    "2005 ) leads to our best estimate of the distance to psr b1913 + 16 : @xmath79 kpc .",
    "as noted above , the uncertainty in the general relativistic orbital decay rate of this pulsar is currently dominated by the uncertainty in the quantity @xmath80 .",
    "for these purposes , it is useful to give @xmath81",
    "relatively nearby pulsars are excellent targets for studies of the tiny - scale atomic structure ( tsas , @xcite ) .",
    "comparison of their hi absorption spectra at multiple epochs as they move across the sky permits us to study structure down to au scales .",
    "we discuss here our measurements of five such pulsars .",
    "all but two have been previously observed , so we will search for changes between the previous and current epochs .",
    "the pulsars observing parameters , distances , and transverse velocities are listed in table 3 .",
    "the pulsars discussed in this section are all located at high galactic latitudes ( in all cases , @xmath82 ) . since their lines of sight",
    "leave the galactic hydrogen layer fairly quickly , they are not amenable to the kinematic distance technique discussed in  3 .",
    "conversely , we can not search for temporal absorption variations in the low - latitude pulsars of  3 because two have never before been observed , and the third s absorption spectrum was too noisy at the earlier epoch to yield meaningful differences .",
    "( indeed we reobserved it in order to more confidently measure its kinematic distance because the noise in the earlier spectrum precluded a secure result . )",
    "the hi absorption spectrum of this pulsar was first observed in 1976 - 77 by @xcite .",
    "that spectrum and our new one are plotted together in fig . [ fig : b0301 + 19 ] .",
    "both epochs spectra have a similar @xmath83 km / s resolution .",
    "both the _ integrated _ optical depth ( the equivalent width ) and the depth of most individual absorption components have changed significantly between the two epochs . although the early observations were gathered with a spectrometer that digitized the signal to only one bit , its response to rapidly varying pulsar signals was very well - characterized by @xcite .",
    "careful quantization corrections have also been made for the current epoch @xcite .",
    "hence we believe that both spectra are accurate and that the change is real .",
    "the channel spacing of the old and new spectra are 1.056 and 1.031 km / s , respectively . in order to study the absorption changes more carefully , we slightly coarsened the spacing of the new data via interpolation to match the channel spacing and center frequency of the old data .",
    "we also ensured that the old and new channel frequencies matched by verifying that the ( essentially noise - free ) _ emission _ spectra were consistent to less than a channel width .",
    "[ fig : b0301 + 19diff ] displays the old and ( resampled ) new absorption spectra ( top ) and their difference ( bottom ) .",
    "the difference spectrum also displays a @xmath84 noise envelope in order to assess the significance of variations .",
    "[ the noise envelope grows at the central velocities because the hi emission line itself contributes significantly to the system noise @xcite .",
    "] the difference spectrum clearly shows a general trend whereby the absorption line depth is greater at the later epoch in most of the central channels , with the largest single - channel difference being significant at the 2.6@xmath16 level .",
    "the @xmath85 year time baseline is unique in being one of the longest extant showing absorption variations , leading to a length scale of @xmath8 au which is second only to the psr 1557 - 50 scale of @xmath86 au @xcite .",
    "further implications of these results for small - scale structure in the interstellar medium will be analyzed in a separate paper ( stanimirovic et al , in preparation ) .",
