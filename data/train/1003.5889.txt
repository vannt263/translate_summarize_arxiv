    "obtaining unbiased spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for local and distant galaxy populations provides a crucial yardstick by which to compare their properties and eventually relate such populations along evolutionary paths within any given galaxy evolution framework .",
    "unbiased spectral line energy distributions ( hereafter sleds ) of the rotational transitions of molecules such as co , hcn , hco@xmath8 are of particular importance since :    * they can trace the mass distribution of the star formation fuel , the molecular gas , across its considerable range of properties ( @xmath9@xmath10(@xmath11@xmath12)@xmath13 , @xmath14@xmath15 ( 10200)k ) * relative molecular line strengths are in principle extinction - free probes of molecular gas properties and agn - versus - starburst as power sources of ir luminosities of galaxies ( meijerink & spaans 2005 ; meijerink , spaans , & israel 2006 ) * imaging their emission distribution and velocity fields at mm / submm wavelengths yields unique dynamical mass probes of deeply dust - enshrouded star - forming galaxies and qso host galaxies across the universe ( e.g. walter et al .",

    "2006 ) * cooling and thus the thermodynamic state of the molecular gas ( heated by stellar far - uv light , cosmic rays , and turbulent motions ) is regulated by [ cii ] , [ oii ] and high - j co line emission , which in turn may efficiently regulate the local jeans mass and the stellar imf ( elmegreen , klessen , & wilson 2008 ) .",
    "much of the star formation in the distant universe occurs in heavily dust - enshrouded ir - luminous systems ( e.g. smail , ivison , & blain 1997 ) , challenging to image at optical wavelengths even with the current 8 - 10 meter - class telescopes .",
    "thus it may well be that in the upcoming era of alma molecular lines will replace optical and even ir lines as the most potent probes of galaxy structure and of the power sources that drive galaxy evolution across cosmic epoch .",
    "the recent discovery of significant dust optical depths _ even at submm wavelengths _ in arp220 ( a local prototype of dust - enshrouded extreme starbursts ) by sakamoto et al .",
    "2008 further highlights how deeply obscured such extreme star - forming systems can  be .",
    "local templates are key in understanding not only the properties of local galaxy populations , but also of those in the distant universe . to this end",

    "the latter remain as the most effective beacons of the most distant galaxies where molecular lines have been detected ( walter et al .",
    "2004 ) , and can be the cause of distinct molecular gas excitation conditions in high redshift quasars ( schleicher , spaans , & klessen  2010 ) .",
    "in this paper we report on sensitive co j=65 line measurements for galaxies in our survey .",
    "this allows : a ) a first systematic glimpse of their high - excitation molecular gas phase , b ) constraints on their co sleds , and c ) direct comparisons with starburst and agn - dominated systems at high redshifts where predominantly only high - j co lines are currently available ( e.g. solomon & vanden bout 2005 ; omont 2007 ) . throughout this work",
    "we adopt a flat @xmath23-dominated cosmology with @xmath24kms@xmath25mpc@xmath25 and @xmath26 , and calculate luminosity distances using the ned calculator developed by wright ( 2006 ) .",

    "the availability of the co j=10 line flux ( @xmath31@xmath155.5k and @xmath32@xmath15410@xmath13 ) for all selected lirgs allows an inventory of _ all _ the co - rich molecular gas phases irrespective of their average excitation state , and is thus a prerequisite if the fraction of the star - forming dense and warm molecular gas is to be determined .",
    "the latter is constrained from high - j co line luminosities and reliable global co ( high - j)/(10 ) line ratios ( and hence our second criterion for source compactness ) .    finally , along with the aforementioned lirg sample , two local powerful agn",
    "were also included for multi - j co observations as a pilot study of the possible effects of the agn on the global molecular gas reservoir of their hosts , and to guide future efforts towards a large molecular line survey of agn - selected rather than starburst - selected systems .",
    "the two agn chosen are the powerful f - rii radio galaxy 3c293 whose powerful jets strongly interact with the ambient neutral gas ( morganti et al .",
    "2003 ) , and the optically luminous but radio quiet qso pg1119 + 120 .",
    "both have single dish and interferometric co j=10 line measurements that find its emission concentrated in regions with @xmath33@xmath345@xmath357@xmath35 around their active nucleus ( evans et al . 1999 , 2001 , 2005 ) , and thus satisfy our compactness criterion .",
    "we conducted the co j=65 measurements as part of our multi - j co and hcn line survey of lirgs in the local universe .",
    "the first co j=65 ( 691.473ghz ) line measurements with the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) atop mauna kea ( hawaii ) were conducted for the luminous ulirg / qso mrk231 and the lirg arp193 , using the old w / d band ( 620710ghz ) receiver ( operating in ssb mode ) on 20 of february and 22 of april 2005 respectively , under very dry conditions ( @xmath36@xmath340.035 ) .",
    "the typical system temperatures were @xmath37@xmath15(37005500)k ( including atmospheric absorption ) .",
    "the das spectrometer was used at its widest mode of 1.8ghz ( @xmath38780kms@xmath25 at 690ghz ) , and rapid beam switching at @xmath39=2hz with azimuthal throws of @xmath40 resulted in remarkably flat baselines .",
    "the beam size at 691ghz is @xmath41=8@xmath35 .",
    "good pointing with such narrow beams is crucial and was checked every 4560mins using differential pointing with receiver b3(350ghz ) .",
    "the latter technique can access many more compact sources in the sky in order to conduct pointing checks than direct pointing with the w / d receiver , and was found accurate to within @xmath42@xmath432.6@xmath35 ( rms ) .",
    "the aperture efficiency for these periods was found to be @xmath44=0.25 .",
    "the main set of co j=65 observations were conducted during several periods in january , february , march and may 2009 with the upgraded w / d receiver and its new sis mixers ( effectively the same type that will equip the alma telescopes at this waveband ) that dramatically enhance its performance .",
    "the resulting low receiver temperatures allowed very sensitive observations with typical @xmath45(15003000)k ( including atmospheric transmission ) for @xmath46@xmath470.0350.06 .",
    "dual channel operation ( two polarization channels aligned within @xmath301@xmath35 ) further enhanced the w / d band observing capability of the jcmt .",
    "the new acsis spectrometer was used at its widest mode of 1.8ghz ( @xmath43780kms@xmath25 at 690ghz ) , and in a few cases ( e.g. arp220 ) two separate tunnings per object with an effective bandwidth of @xmath153.2ghz ( @xmath151390kms@xmath25 ) ensured adequate coverage of co lines with fwzi@xmath10 8001000kms@xmath25 .",
    "rapid beam switching at @xmath48=4hz ( continuum mode ) with a throw of @xmath49 ( in azimuth ) yielded flat baselines under most circumstances .",
    "finally the pointing was checked every 4560mins by observing compact sources with w / d receiver itself , and differential pointing with the a3 receiver ( 230ghz ) , yielding rms residual error radius of @xmath42@xmath50@xmath51 ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "the aperture efficiency for these periods is @xmath44=0.32 , and a flux calibration uncertainty of @xmath1525% ( encompassing @xmath52 variations and 3-load calibration uncertainties ) was estimated from observations of several strong spectral line standards at @xmath43690ghz .",
    "a final set of co j=65 observations were obtained recently during several days between 12 and 23 of january , and 5 - 6 of february 2010 under dry weather conditions ( @xmath53@xmath340.05 ) that yielded typical system temperatures of @xmath54@xmath47(14002800)k .",
    "the spectrometer setup was identical to that used in our 2009 observations with two separate tunnings used to cover a wide line in a few objects ( e.g. mrk273 , ngc6240 ) . observations of mars yielded an aperture efficiency of @xmath44=0.35 , while the overal calibration uncertainty remained within @xmath4325% .",
    "the same beam switching scheme was employed while pointing was checked every hour and its accuracy remained within the range shown in figure  1 .",
    "we inspected each 10-min spectrum for baseline ripples and intensity `` spikes '' in individual channels .",
    "the edited co j=65 spectra were then co - added and are shown in figure  2 , overlaid ( mostly ) with co j=32 lines .",
    "the velocity - integrated line flux densities were then estimated from those spectra , after subtraction of linear baselines , using    @xmath55    where @xmath56=15.62 and @xmath57 is the aperture efficiency .",
    "the factor @xmath58=@xmath59 , with @xmath60 and @xmath61=(source diameter ) accounts for the geometric coupling of a gaussian main beam to a finite - sized disk - like source when @xmath62 is available .",
    "for point - like sources , even with the accurate tracking and pointing achievable by enclosed telescopes such as the jcmt , the residual rms pointing errors and the narrow beams of large mm / submm telescopes at high frequencies can lead to a substantial systematic reduction of the measured fluxes of compact sources . in papadopoulos et al .",
    "( 2009 ) this is shown to be    @xmath63    ( see also condon 2001 ) where @xmath64 is the rms pointing error per direction ( for identical error distributions per coordinate ) .",
    "thus in equation 1 , when @xmath65 , @xmath66 , since the geometric coupling correction is then overtaken by the pointing error correction .",
    "the archetypal starburst arp220 has been reobserved during our 2010 observing campaign , and a significantly larger ( @xmath432.6 times ) integrated line flux has been measured , along with a different line profile .",
    "the latter now agrees well with those from high - density gas tracers such as hcn j=32 ( see figure 3 ) which places the highest density gas at the high velocity component corresponding to emission from the eastern nucleus ( see greve et al . 2009 and references therein ) .",
    "we thus conclude that the first co j=65 measurement of arp220 reported by papadopoulos et al .",
    "2010 has likely been affected by a pointing offset of the order of @xmath42@xmath474.7@xmath35 ( @xmath433.3@xmath35 per direction ) .",
    "this is clearly an outlier of the distributions shown in figure 1 but is certainly possible and accounts also for the different co j=65 line profile shown in papadopoulos et al .",
    "2010 ( @xmath67@xmath434.7@xmath35 in this system of two co - bright nuclei @xmath681@xmath35 apart can yield a maximum apparent emission asymmetry of s(v@xmath69)/s(v@xmath70)@xmath150.54 between two intrinsically equal emission contributions at the velocity centers v@xmath69 and v@xmath70 of the two nuclei ) .",
    "finally our fast - switching scheme allows an independent estimate of the adjacent dust continuum from the line - free part of the spectrum , which we find to be @xmath71=@xmath72jy , in good agreement with the value given by dunne & eales 2001 rather than that in the jcmt calibrator database .",
    "the ramifications from this revision are discussed in section 3.2 .",
    "the sources , their coordinates and co j=65 line flux densities ( using equation 1 ) are tabulated in table 1 .",
    "the corresponding line luminosities are estimated  using    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the continuum - subtracted line brightness temperature emerging at the source frame , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the total linewidth and line - emitting source area , @xmath77 is the luminosity distance , and @xmath78 the line rest - frame frequency . substituting and converting to astrophysical units yields    @xmath79    while the conversion to ordinary luminosity units ( @xmath80 ) , used for the co sleds , is    @xmath81l_{\\odot}.\\ ] ]    in table  2 we tabulate the total ir luminosity l@xmath0 of each system , with any contribution from a warm agn - heated dust subtracted when possible . in that table",
    "we also list the ir luminosity due to star formation l@xmath82 ( see section  4 ) , as well as the @xmath83=@xmath84 and @xmath85=@xmath86 line ratios .",
    "the latter is currently the most widely available one for conducting comparisons between the excitation conditions in our local lirg sample and high - z starbursts , though for some high - z systems the `` neighboring '' j=76 transition rather than j=65 is the one available ( tacconi et al .",

    "such high sfes are one the many indicators of the extreme ism conditions found in such systems , with several studies ( e.g. solomon et al . 1992 ; aalto et al .",

    "_ this contradiction between the excitation conditions of the star - forming molecular gas and the emergent faint co j=65 line emission ( and thus low @xmath128 ) found in some lirgs becomes even more acute when additional information from other transitions tracing the same phase as co j=65 ( e.g. those of hcn ) is used to further narrow the expected range of @xmath100 . the ( u)lirgs arp220 and ngc6240 are excellent such examples , with a multi - j line survey of several heavy rotor molecules available to constraint the @xmath128 ratio ( see section 3.2 ) . for all other local lirgs",

    "this is a result of the high dust temperatures in the compact regions ( which makes their emission peak at wavelengths where the outer dust distribution remains very absorptive i.e. at ir / far - ir wavelengths ) , and their high dust optical depths over almost the entire observed range of a typical sed .",
    "the latter diminishes the emission contribution of those compact and warm starburst regions well below from being proportional to their dust mass content .",
    "one of the most unexpected discoveries made by _",

    "1998 , 2003 ) .",
    "this was deemed all the more perplexing for ulirgs since the [ cii ] fine structure line at 157.74@xmath1 m is the major ism cooling line and would thus be expected to be particularly bright in such extreme star - forming systems .",
    "various explanations have been offered for this such as : a ) absorption by a cooler dust _ foreground _ `` screen '' , b ) saturation of the [ cii ] line luminosity ( while the ir continuum rises unabated ) predicted for high density pdrs or pdrs in which the local uv radiation field is high and the gas density is low , c ) soft far - uv radiation fields ( see malhotra et al .",
    "1997 ; luhman et al .",
    "1998 for a review ) .",
    "significant submm dust optical depths for the bulk of the dust mass suggests a simple and common cause for the [ cii ] and the high - j co lines luminosity deficiency in some ulirgs since in an almost featureless black body dust continuum , no lines are expected from a concomitant isothermal gas reservoir . in particular the weakness of the co j=65 line argues against the most prominent alternative explanation given for the [ cii ] line luminosity deficit : the dense and/or strongly far - uv illuminated pdrs where in fact such high - j co lines ought to be very luminous .",
    "finally even modest submm dust optical depths such as @xmath219@xmath680.2 ( from equation 8 and @xmath220=@xmath221@xmath222 , @xmath191=40pc ) correspond to @xmath223@xmath431.3 ( for @xmath224=2 ) for the dust continuum at the rest frequency of the [ cii ] line , yielding a f(@xmath225)=@xmath226=0.56 reduction in line strength with respect to the optically thin case .",
    "high dust optical depths at short submm wavelengths in some lirgs ( worryingly amongst those frequently used as local analogues of high - z starbursts ) can significantly suppress high - j co or indeed any other high - frequency line emission from their starburst - fueling dense molecular gas distributions . in figure 9",
    "we demonstrate the effects of dust optical depth on the co sled of arp220 , the first case where these can be significant ( papadopoulos et al . 2010 ) . the highly - excited `` intrinsic '' co sled derived for its massive dense and warm gas phase ( greve et al .",

    "we adopted an emissivity law of @xmath224=2 and @xmath230=0.2 , 1.0 at the rest frequency of co j=32 ( @xmath15350ghz ) .",
    "these values bracket the range of submm optical depths deduced from submm interferometry ( @xmath231@xmath151 ; sakamoto et al .",

    "in such systems , unlike local lirgs whose molecular gas properties can be constrained by many low frequency molecular lines ( where dust optical depths remain negligible ) , separating dust optical depth effects from genuinely low - excitation gas can be  difficult .",
    "the physical conditions of star - forming molecular gas used to deduce its `` intrinsic '' co sled in lirgs ( section 3.1 ) are typical , however significant deviations do exist .",

    "the corresponding co sled for the dense gas in arp193 already turns over at co j=32 , in contrast to the hcn - bright star - forming phase of ngc6240 which is expected to emit copiously up to co j=109 ( figure  10 ) .",
    "it should be noted that besides similar @xmath250 , these lirgs both have @xmath176@xmath68(0.51)@xmath251@xmath89 ( for the co - h@xmath70 conversion factor of downes & solomon 1998 ) , global sf efficiencies @xmath252@xmath1050l@xmath253/m@xmath254 , and similar dense gas mass fractions as indicated by @xmath255=@xmath256 ( @xmath1110.05 for arp193 , and @xmath150.08 for ngc6240 ) .",
    "this shows that observables commonly available for lirgs such as ir luminosity , co j=10 , and hcn j=10 lines , may provide no indication of very different molecular gas excitation conditions and co sleds , at least on an individual object  basis .",
    "the rapid evolution of starburst events can in principle have short periods during which a ( u)lirg stays ir - luminous while its dense gas phase is strongly dispersed and/or depleted , by the formation of stars and their concentrated and coherent mechanical feedback ( loenen 2009 ) .",
    "this could place lirgs such as ngc6240 and arp193 at the two ends of such a short evolutionary track , but observations of similar objects are needed to decide such issues .",
    "finally we note that a population of near - ir selected gas - rich galaxies with ulirg - levels of star formation ( @xmath15100150@xmath257 ) but very low ( comparable to the milky - way ) levels of global molecular gas excitation , and star - formation efficiency similar to arp193 , has been recently revealed at high redshifts ( daddi et al .",
    "2008 ; dannerbauer et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "once both possibilities of large dust optical depths at short submm wavelengths and low gas excitation have been recognized as affecting emergent co sleds , they can be hard to tell apart without additional information from other lines tracing the dense star - forming phase .",
    "these are low - j transitions ( thus not affected by dust ) of hcn or cs , but can be difficult to detect on a routine basis , even in bright nearby lirgs , since the brightest such line : hcn j=10 , typically has @xmath258@xmath43(1/51/30)@xmath147@xmath259 ( e.g. gao & solomon 2004 ) .",
    "an incidious aspect of the aforementioned degeneracy is that some of the most extreme starbursts in the universe can show `` cold '' co sleds despite hosting intense star forming activity simply because their low co ( high - j)/(low - j ) line ratios are attributed to low - excitation ( i.e. non star - forming ) molecular gas rather than dust absorption .",
    "as already discussed in sections 4.1 and 4.2 , global dust emission can not provide a definitive distinction either , even with well - sampled dust seds in the crucial ir / submm range .    in figure 11",
    "we show a possible statistical distinction between these two possibilities using co j=10 ( the main bulk molecular gas mass tracer ) , hcn j=10 ( the most widely used dense gas tracer ) , along with co j=65 , 32 . the @xmath260=@xmath261 ratio ( table 2 ) is considered here as an approximate measure of the dense molecular gas mass fraction ( since @xmath262@xmath15410@xmath13 and @xmath263@xmath1112@xmath13410@xmath137@xmath13 ) , with little sensitivity to temperature since for both co and hcn j=10 : @xmath26445k .",

    "thus , unless one is willing to entertain the possibility of massive amounts of dense but otherwise sf - idle molecular gas in these ( mostly ) merger systems , _ such lirgs are likely to be starbursts with dust - suppressed high - j co lines .",
    "_    considering star formation as a process directly fueled by self - gravitating dense gas means that star formation switches on rapidly in the dense hcn - bright phase , with its typically short dynamical times @xmath266@xmath4310@xmath137yrs ( much shorter than giant molecular cloud evolutionary timescales of @xmath4710@xmath10510@xmath267yrs ) .",
    "this likely yields the tight @xmath28@xmath268 correlation in galaxies ( gao & solomon 2004 ) , extending `` down '' to individual gmcs and spanning 7 - 8 orders of magnitude in @xmath101 ( wu et al . 2005 ) .",
    "it also provides the basis for our aforementioned co - hcn line ratio diagnostic and its ability to `` weed - out '' dust - affected co sleds from genuinely low - excitation ones . in the few cases where multi - j dense gas tracers ( e.g. hcn , cs ) and dust seds are available to constrain the state of the dense gas in lirgs , it is always found in the warm and self - gravitating `` corner '' of the available parameter space , typical of star - forming gas ( mao et al .",

    "almost all of the good solutions found have @xmath293@xmath431549 , indicating highly unbound gas states .",
    "we must also note that in all solutions listed in table  4 the fit continues improving well past the @xmath14=310k limit of the lvg parameter grid , while gas densities remain high ( @xmath43(@xmath221@xmath290)@xmath294 ) . on",
    "the other hand the non - agn cool dust sed in 3c293 carries little luminosity ( @xmath295@xmath68@xmath296l@xmath254 ) and is typical for quiescent  ism .",
    "thus in the powerful radio galaxy 3c293 the molecular gas seems to be in a surprisingly hot , dense , and gravitationally unbound state , whilst the bulk of its concomitant dust reservoir maintains lower temperatures and has only a modest ir luminosity .",
    "tellingly , similar ism conditions have been reported for the turbulent molecular clouds in the galactic center ( rodriguez - fernndez et al .",
    "2001 ) where very warm and dense h@xmath70 is concomitant with cold dust ( pierce - price et al . 2000 ) , as well as in 3c326 , another another frii radio galaxy ( ogle et a. 2007 ) . in the latter case jet - induced shocks are also suggested as the culprit for a lirg - sized mass ( @xmath4710@xmath297m@xmath4 ) of very warm molecular gas ( @xmath14@xmath471251000k ) , despite star formation levels even lower ( @xmath470.1@xmath298 ) than those found in 3c293 .    in figure 12",
    "we show the range of co sleds corresponding to the shocked - excited ism environment of 3c293",
    ". clearly more observations of high - j co lines , now possible with the spaceborne herschel space observatory , are needed to better constrain them and verify shock - excited molecular gas over large scales in this powerful radio galaxy and other similar systems .",
    "the very large molecular gas reservoirs found around radio galaxies at high redshifts , and the potential feedback role of their energetic jets in inducing ( klamer et al . 2004 ) or hindering ( ogle et al . 2007 ) starbursts in galaxy - formation events at early cosmic epochs , makes a detailed study of shock - energized molecular gas even more important .",
    "distinct and accessible `` signatures '' of shocked molecular gas states on sleds of various molecules would be particularly valuable in the upcoming era of  alma .",
    "extremely dense and compact gaseous disks able to attain significant dust optical depths at short submm wavelengths in lirg / agn systems can have dramatic effects on their emergent ism lines used as agn - versus - starburst diagnostics . in the presence of such gas disks around agn , ism line diagnostic using ir and even molecular lines at short submm wavelengths",
    "( e.g. very high - j co lines ) to discriminate between dust - enshrouded agn - excited xdrs versus starburst - excited pdrs can be become difficult to employ .",
    "relative line strengths may then be more indicative of relative dust optical depths rather than intrinsic gas excitation properties and their causes .",
    "interestingly all four lirgs with @xmath299 ( i.e. iras02483 + 4302 , viizw31 , pg1119 + 120 , and mrk231 ) have face - on or nearly face - on molecular gas disks , indicated either by high - resolution co interferometry ( downes and solomon 1998 ) and/or by their narrow co line widths ( 3c293 is the only exception ) .",
    "this would be expected for gas disks where the smaller dust optical depths in face - on than in highly inclined gas disks along the line of sight would enhance their ( line)-(continuum ) contrast .",
    "nevertheless nearly face - on systems with low @xmath100 ratios do exist ( e.g. iras00057 + 4021 ) , and systematic co j=65 observations of optically - selected qso samples ( which will contain many more face - on gas disks ) would be valuable in revealing such geometric  effects .",
    "we report on our new sensitive co j=65 observations of lirgs and two powerful agn with the jcmt , part of a now completed multi - j co and hcn molecular line survey .",
    "our findings are as follows :    \\1 .",
    "large dust optical depths at short submm wavelengths can suppress the co j=65 line in some extreme starbursts by immersing it in strong continuum dust emission .",
    "this can yield faint co j+1@xmath97j lines for j+1@xmath3006 , even in ulirgs whose large amounts of dense star - forming molecular are intrinsically luminous in such lines .",
    "such high optical depths can easily account for the so - called [ cii ] line luminosity deficity known to exists in such systems .",
    "global dust emission seds can not unambigiously distinguish between high dust optical depths at far - ir / submm wavelengths or large amounts of cold dust , as they can both contribute to the far - ir / submm part of the dust emission sed in a similar fashion .",
    "the suppressing effects of high dust optical depths on the high frequency part of co sleds are difficult to distinguish from genuine low gas excitation .",
    "low - frequency ( @xmath301350ghz ) line observations of highly dipolar heavy rotor molecules ( e.g. hcn , cs ) , with their high critical densities but unhindered by potentially large dust extinctions at submm wavelengths , can `` break '' this degeneracy . in the simplest such application we propose that lirgs with large hcn / co j=10 but very low co ( 65)/(32 ) line ratios are likely to have dust - affected rather than low - excitation co sleds",
    "remarkably high co line excitation , above that typical for star - forming gas , is found for the hosts of two prominent agn , an optically bright qso ( pg1119 + 120 ) and a radio galaxy ( 3c293 ) .",
    "the latter could be the first known case of a shock - excited co sled , likely powered by a strong jet - ism interaction . as a result much of its large molecular gas reservoir is hot ( @xmath302@xmath6100k ) and dense ( @xmath94@xmath9810@xmath104@xmath13 ) while most of its dust mass remains `` cool '' ( @xmath185@xmath12615k ) typical of quiescent ism with low star formation rates .    in summary ,",
    "the emerging picture of co sleds in lirgs and agn seems diverse , with high dust optical depths at short submm wavelengths capable of `` quenching '' high - j co line emission in extreme starbursts while low global gas excitation remaining a possibility in such systems .",
    "finally , shocks and possibly x - rays seem capable of surpassing far - uv photons as the main excitation contributors in agn hosts . the now spaceborne herschel space observatory is ideally suited for fully characterizing these environments via high - j molecular line observations of local ir - bright galaxies and agn , paving the way for alma and the study of such phenomena across cosmic epoch .",
    "we would like to take this opportunity to thank the entire superb crew of people that make jcmt a success over so many years .",
    "special thanks to the telescope system specialists : benjamin warrington , jim hoge , jonathan kemp , and jan wouterloot for expertly assisting this project .",
    "jessica dempsey and per friberg deserve much credit for helping commission the w / d receiver , as well as iain coulson and antonio chrysostomou for supporting and flexibly allocating the generous amounts of time necessary to conclude this project .",
    "we would like to also thank holly thomas for assisting us with crucial aspects of telescope pointing .",
    "like all wines from the island of santorini , you are all good .",
    "finally we thank the referee for useful suggestions that much enhanced this work , and would like to thank again the referee of the paper by papadopoulos et al .",

    "<S> we report on new sensitive co j=65 line observations of several luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs : l@xmath0(81000@xmath1m@xmath210@xmath3l@xmath4 ) , 36% ( 8/22 ) of them ulirgs ( l@xmath5@xmath610@xmath7l@xmath4 ) , and two powerful local agn : the optically luminous qso pg1119 + 120 , and the powerful radio galaxy 3c293 using the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) on mauna kea in hawaii . </S>",
    "<S> we combine these observations with existing low - j co data and dust emission spectral energy distributions ( seds ) in the far - infrared - submillimetre from the literature to constrain the properties of the star - forming ism in these systems . </S>",
    "<S> we then build the first _ local _ co spectral line energy distributions ( sleds ) for the _ global _ molecular gas reservoirs that reach up to high j - levels . </S>",
    "<S> these co sleds are neither biased by strong lensing ( which affects many of those constructed for high - redshift galaxies ) , nor suffer from undersampling of co - bright regions ( as most current high - j co observations of nearby extended systems do ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find : 1 ) a significant influence of dust optical depths on the high - j co lines , suppressing the j=65 line emission in some of the most ir - luminous lirgs , 2 ) low global co line excitation possible even in vigorously star - forming systems , 3 ) the first case of a shocked - powered high - excitation co sled in the radio galaxy 3c293 where a powerful jet - ism interaction occurs , and 4 ) unusually highly excitated gas in the optically powerful qso pg1119 + 120 . in arp220 and possibly other ( u)lirgs very faint co j=65 lines can be attributed to _ significant dust optical depths at short submm wavelengths _ immersing those lines in a strong dust continuum , and also causing the c@xmath8 line luminosity deficit often observed in such extreme starbursts . </S>",
    "<S> re - analysis of the co line ratios available for submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) suggests that similar dust opacities may be also present in these high - redshift starbursts , with genuinely low - excitation of large amounts of _ sf - quiescent _ gas the only other possibility for their often low co ( high - j)/(low - j ) line ratios . </S>",
    "<S> we then present a statistical method of separating these two almost degenerate possibilities , and show that high dust optical depths at submm wavelengths can impede the diagnostic potential of submm / ir lines ( e.g. starburst versus agn as gas excitation agents ) , which is of particular importance for the upcoming observations of the herschel space observatory and the era of  alma . </S>"
