    "the milc collaboration is studying high temperature qcd with three flavors of improved staggered quarks  @xcite using the asqtad quark action  @xcite .",
    "simulations are being carried out with lattice spacings @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we are considering two cases : 1 ) all three quarks have the same mass @xmath5 ; and 2 ) the two lightest quarks have equal mass @xmath1 , while the mass of the third quark is fixed at approximately that of the strange quark @xmath0 .",
    "we refer to these cases as @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "we have carried out studies with @xmath8 for the @xmath6 case , and with @xmath9 for @xmath7 . at the masses we have studied to date",
    ", we find rapid crossovers , which sharpen as the quark mass is reduced , rather than a _ bona fide _ phase transition . during the past year",
    "we have extended and clarified our calculations of the quark number susceptibilities , which provide an excellent signal for the crossover , and which are directly related to event by event fluctuations in heavy ion collisions .",
    "comparison of susceptibilities at different lattice spacings show that our results are close to the continuum values .",
    "we have also sharpened our estimates of the crossover temperature for both the @xmath6 and @xmath7 cases .",
    "lattices for @xmath6 .",
    "[ rp_nf3_nt8 ] , width=259 ]    for both the @xmath6 and @xmath10 cases we have carried out thermodynamics studies on lattices with four , six and eight times slices , and aspect ratio @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 are the spatial and temporal dimensions of the lattice in units of the lattice spacing . at the lightest quark masses",
    ", we also performed some simulations with aspect ratio three , and obtained results that are indistinguishable from those with aspect ratio two .",
    "for both cases the standard thermodynamic quantities show a crossover from confined behavior at low temperature to deconfined behavior at high temperature , as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ rp_nf3_nt8 ] where we plot the real part of the polyakov loop for @xmath6 on @xmath14 lattices .",
    "there is a slight trend for the temperature dependence of the polyakov loop to be steeper for larger quark masses .",
    "this is to be expected , since at sufficiently large quark masses , it is a _ bona fide _ order parameter .",
    "the @xmath15 susceptibility @xmath16 provides a clear signal for the crossover .",
    "it is given by    @xmath17    we plot this quantity as a function of temperature on @xmath18 lattices in fig .  [ chi_tot_nf21_nt4 ] .",
    "note the increase in the height of the peak as the quark mass is decreased . our work and that of the bielefeld group  @xcite strongly suggests that in the real world , @xmath7 , there is no phase transition at the physical quark masses . with this assumption , we have estimated the critical temperature for @xmath7 at the physical value of @xmath1 through an extrapolation of the form     susceptibility as a function of temperature on @xmath18 lattices for @xmath7 .",
    "[ chi_tot_nf21_nt4],width=259 ]    @xmath19    where we evaluated @xmath20 for each value of @xmath13 and @xmath21 for which we have made measurements from the peak in the @xmath15 susceptibility . for a second order phase transition in the o(4 ) universality class at @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "we find that @xmath24  mev with a @xmath25 of 2.1 for 11 degrees of freedom .",
    "the first error is the fit error , the second from the uncertainty in @xmath26 , taken as 0.317(7 )  fm  @xcite . to test the sensitivity of @xmath20 to @xmath27",
    ", we have also performed a fit with @xmath28 , which yields @xmath29  mev with a @xmath25 of 1.5 for 11 degrees of freedom .",
    "so , the goodness of the fit does not allow us to prefer either of them .",
    "in order to study the quark number susceptibilities  @xcite , we introduce chemical potentials @xmath30 coupled to a set of mutually commuting conserved charges @xmath31 .",
    "the quark number susceptibilities are related to event - by - event fluctuations in heavy ion collisions  @xcite by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem        rather than choosing the three independent charges to be the number operators for up , down and strange quarks , it appears more physical to take them to be the @xmath36-component of isospin , @xmath37 , the hypercharge , @xmath38 , and the baryon number , @xmath39 .",
    "the rows and columns of the susceptibility matrix , @xmath40 are then labeled by @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in the @xmath6 case ,",
    "where @xmath44 , @xmath45 is a diagonal matrix , and there are no correlations among fluctuations in @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , while for the @xmath7 case , where @xmath46 , the only correlations are between fluctuations in hypercharge and baryon number . for temperatures below the phase transition or crossover ,",
    "the lightest particle that can be excited by a chemical potential coupled to @xmath37 is the pion , while for chemical potentials coupled to @xmath38 and @xmath39 it is the kaon and the nucleon , respectively . above the transition temperature",
    "each of the chemical potentials can excite quark states that are much lighter than hadrons , so we expect the diagonal elements of @xmath45 to increase sharply in the vicinity of the transition , and they do .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ qno_combo_new2 ] where we plot the diagonal elements of the susceptibility matrix , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , as a function of temperature for two light quarks with mass @xmath50 and one heavy quark with mass @xmath0 on @xmath51 lattices . @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    "have been multiplied by factors of 3/4 and 3/2 respectively , so that the quantities plotted approach the same high temperature limit as @xmath47 .",
    "also shown is @xmath52 , the only non - zero off - diagonal matrix element of @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "it measures correlations between fluctuations in the hypercharge and baryon number .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath52 in this figure is the geometric mean of those for @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the good agreement between these results , and similar ones on lattices with eight time slices , indicate that they are close to their physical values .",
