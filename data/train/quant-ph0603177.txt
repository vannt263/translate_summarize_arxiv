    "this paper is devoted to construct and characterize the analytic continuation of the lippmann - schwinger bras and kets , as well as the analytic continuation of the `` in '' and `` out '' wave functions .",
    "this paper follows up on ref .",
    "@xcite , where we obtained and characterized the solutions of the lippmann - schwinger equation associated with the energies of the physical spectrum .",
    "we showed in  @xcite that such solutions are accommodated by the rigged hilbert space rather than by the hilbert space alone . in this paper",
    ", we shall show that the analytic continuation of the lippmann - schwinger bras and kets is also accommodated by the rigged hilbert space rather than by the hilbert space alone .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the lippmann - schwinger bras and kets are distributions that act on a space of test functions @xmath0 .",
    "the space @xmath1 arises from invariance under the action of the hamiltonian and from the need to tame purely imaginary exponentials .",
    "these two requirements force the functions of @xmath1 to have a polynomial falloff at infinity .",
    "the resulting @xmath1 is a space of test functions of the schwartz type . in this paper",
    ", it is shown that the analytic continuation of the lippmann - schwinger bras and kets are distributions that act on a space of test functions @xmath2 .",
    "the space @xmath2 arises from invariance under the action of the hamiltonian and from the need to tame real exponentials .",
    "these two requirements force the elements of @xmath2 to fall off at infinity faster than real exponentials .",
    "more precisely , we shall ask the elements of @xmath2 to fall off faster than gaussians .",
    "the resulting @xmath2 is therefore of the ultra - distribution type .",
    "we recall that an ultra - distribution is an infinitely differentiable test function that falls off at infinity faster than exponentials .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtained the time evolution of wave functions and of the lippmann - schwinger bras and kets associated with real energies , and we saw that it is given by the standard quantum mechanical group time evolution . in this paper",
    ", we shall see that analytically continuing the time evolution of the wave functions results into a semigroup .",
    "we shall argue , although not fully prove , that analytically continuing the time evolution of lippmann - schwinger bras and kets also results into a semigroup .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we restrict ourselves to the spherical shell potential @xmath3 for zero angular momentum",
    ". nevertheless , our results are valid for a larger class of potentials that include , in particular , potentials of finite range .",
    "the reason why our results are valid for such a large class of potentials is that , ultimately , such results depend on whether one can analytically continue the jost and scattering functions into the whole complex plane . since",
    "such continuation is possible for potentials that fall off at infinity faster than any exponential  @xcite , our results remain valid for a whole lot of interesting potentials .    in this paper",
    ", there will be a change in notation with respect to ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we used the symbol @xmath4 to denote the `` out '' states , and @xmath5 , @xmath6 to denote the asymptotically free `` in '' and `` out '' states . in the present paper , for the sake of brevity",
    ", we shall use the symbol @xmath7 to denote the `` out '' wave functions @xmath4 , and @xmath8 to denote any asymptotically free wave function such as @xmath5 or @xmath6 .    throughout the paper",
    ", we shall always use radial analytic continuation , because the transformation @xmath9 converts a radial path of integration into another radial path , while it distorts horizontal paths of integration .",
    "since the physical spectrum of the spherical shell potential is @xmath10 , one may wonder if performing analytic continuations is somehow inconsistent . to qualm any doubts",
    ", we recall that the @xmath11 matrix , which is defined and unitary on the physical spectrum , is routinely continued into the complex plane . much the same way",
    ", one can continue the wave functions and the lippmann - schwinger bras and kets into complex energies .",
    "an important point is what happens with the self - adjointness of the hamiltonian on the space of test functions @xmath2 ( and also on @xmath1 ) .",
    "these spaces satisfy @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the domain on which the hamiltonian is self - adjoint  @xcite .",
    "thus , on @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the hamiltonian is not a self - adjoint operator but just the restriction of a self - adjoint one .",
    "as shall be shown , the analytically continued lippmann - schwinger bras and kets are eigenvectors of the hamiltonian with complex eigenvalues , and one may naturally wonder whether such complex eigenvalues are in conflict with the self - adjointness of the hamiltonian , which in principle forbids any complex eigenvalues . to see how self - adjoint operators can have complex eigenvalues , let us consider the 1d momentum operator @xmath14 .",
    "the eigenfunctions of @xmath15 are @xmath16 with eigenvalue @xmath17 .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath17 can in principle be _ any _ complex number , although of course the physical spectrum of @xmath15 is the real line and in the completeness relation there only appear real @xmath17 .",
    "similarly , the eigenvalue equation for the spherical shell hamiltonian is valid for any complex number ( if additional boundary conditions are not imposed ) . needless to say , the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian with complex eigenvalues are not in the hilbert space they are distributions and",
    "thus there arises no conflict with the self - adjointness of the hamiltonian .",
    "analytic continuations of the lippmann - schwinger equation have also been performed in  @xcite by assuming that , in the energy representation , the lippmann - schwinger bras and kets act on two different spaces of hardy functions .",
    "contrary to  @xcite , we shall not make any a priori assumption .",
    "rather , we shall simply obtain the analytic continuation and study its properties .",
    "as it turns out , the analytically continued lippmann - schwinger bras and kets do not act on spaces of hardy functions . therefore , our results differ drastically from those of  @xcite .",
    "the rigged hilbert space we shall use is very similar to , although not the same as the rigged hilbert space used by bollini _",
    "et al . _  to describe the resonance ( gamow ) states  @xcite .",
    "there are two major differences .",
    "first , bollini _",
    "et al . _",
    "use a space of test functions that fall off at infinity faster than exponentials , whereas we shall use test functions that fall off faster than gaussians .",
    "the advantage of using gaussian falloff is that , as will be discussed elsewhere , one can obtain meaningful resonance expansions .",
    "second , bollini _",
    "_  obtain many results by using the momentum representation and the fourier transform , whereas the present paper deals with the wave - number representation and the fourier - like transforms @xmath18 of sec .",
    "[ sec : wnumrepr ] .",
    "the advantage of the wave - number representation is that in such representation , the hamiltonian acts as a multiplication operator , whereas in the momentum representation , the hamiltonian acts as a complicated integral operator .",
    "the simplicity of the wave - number representation will allow us to go beyond the results of  @xcite .",
    "the ultimate goal we want to achieve by analytically continuing the solutions of the lippmann - schwinger equation is to obtain the resonance states .",
    "although this point will be treated elsewhere , we want to present a brief preview of the results .",
    "the resonance states are usually obtained by solving the schrdigner equation subject to purely outgoing boundary conditions , but they can also be obtained by analytically continuing the lippmann - schwinger bras and kets into the resonance energies .",
    "the results of this paper will enable us to do just so , and to obtain some novel properties of the gamow states .",
    "the resulting gamow states will turn out to be different from the so - called `` gamow vectors '' of  @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
