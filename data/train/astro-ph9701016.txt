    "the character of the emission line spectra of powerful radio galaxies is strongly determined by the ionization mechanism of the gas . for most low redshift ( @xmath20.1 )",
    "radio galaxies photoionization by a central agn describes rather well the general properties of the optical emission line spectra ( _ e.g. _ robinson et al .",
    "1987 ) . however , when the first high redshift radio galaxies ( hzrg , @xmath3 ) were discovered the situation was not so clear .",
    "these objects showed very blue colours and strong ly@xmath4 emission  properties expected for galaxies in the process of formation ( _ e.g. _ spinrad _ et al .",
    "_ 1985 , mccarthy _",
    "it was proposed that some of these hzrg , like 3c326.1 , were very young galaxies in which the strong ly@xmath4 emission was powered by the young blue stars ( mccarthy _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 ) .    however , detailed analysis of the spectra showed that young stars could not explain the general properties of the uv emission lines of hzrg ; in particular , the large emission line equivalent widths and the existence of highly ionized species , like civ and heii ( _ e.g. _ mccarthy _ et al",
    ". _ 1990 ) .    in the context of the unified schemes for powerful radio galaxies ( _ e.g. _",
    "barthel 1989 ) , we would expect these galaxies to harbour powerful agn .",
    "this , together with the fact that agn photoionization succeeded in explaining the optical emission line ratios of low redshift radio galaxies , suggested that the same mechanism dominates the ionization processes in hzrg ( mccarthy 1993 ) . in consequence ,",
    "most attempts to explain the uv emission line spectra of hzrg have invoked pure agn photoionization .    however ,",
    "both imaging and spectroscopy of hzrg show that strong interactions are taking place between the advancing radio jet and the ism of the host galaxy ( section 2 ) .",
    "such interactions will generate powerful shocks which will disturb the morphology , kinematics and physical conditions ( density , temperature , pressure ) of the gas and potentially modify its ionization state .",
    "currently a key issue in the study of these objects is the relative importance of jet - induced shocks and agn illumination : do shocks dominate the emission line processes ? or is agn photoionization dominant with the influence of the shocks mainly manifested in kinematic and morphological disturbances ?",
    "we have addressed this problem by studying the uv emission line spectrum of a sample of very hzrg ( @xmath51.7 ) , comparing their line ratios with both shock and agn photoionization models .",
    "we base our study on the uv lines because most of the information we have about hzrg is derived from studies of the uv emission line spectra . at such high redshifts",
    "the main optical diagnostic emission lines are shifted into the infrared , and most of the existing ir spectra for the hzrg are of poor quality .",
    "in contrast , at low redshifts we have the opposite problem : the optical diagnostic line ratios are well measured , but the uv spectra are of low quality .",
    "for the low redshift objects the optical line ratios have proved inefficient at distinguishing the ionization mechanism unambiguously , although it has been suggested that the uv line ratios might provide a stronger discriminant ( sutherland _ et al .",
    "therefore , the interest in understanding the emission of the uv lines can be extended to low redshift objects .",
    "we propose to develop a diagnostic method to discriminate between shock and agn ionization in radio galaxies at all redshifts .",
    "we review in section 2 the observational evidence for agn illumination and shocks in powerful radio galaxies .",
    "the data sample is described in section 3 and the diagnostic diagrams in section 4 .",
    "sections 5 and 6 present the models and the comparison with the data : section 5 concentrates on the effects of a ) varying the shape of the agn continuum and b ) changing the excitation and ionization mechanism ( shocks ) ; section 6 analyzes the effects that different physical conditions in the extended gas can produce in the observed uv spectra . in section 7 we extend our diagnostic method to low redshift radio galaxies .",
    "section 8 includes summary and conclusions .",
    "in the popular anisotropic illumination model ( _ e.g. _ fosbury 1989 ) , it is postulated that quasars hidden in the cores of powerful radio galaxies illuminate the ambient ism with intense cones of uv / x - ray radiation , with the radiation photoionizing the extended gas within the cones , leading to line emission .",
    "this model appears to be consistent with the observed properties of the majority of _ low - redshift _ radio galaxies .",
    "most importantly , the line ratios measured in the nuclear regions and eelr of radio galaxies , and the trends in these line ratios , generally agree well with photoionization models ( robinson _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 ; binette _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) . the ( weak ) alignment of the eelr with the radio axes ( baum & heckman 1989 ) and relatively undisturbed kinematics ( tadhunter et al .",
    "1989 ) are also consistent with anisotropic illumination by the broad radiation cones predicted by the unified schemes .",
    "although there are no radio galaxy eelr which show the clear cone - like morphologies seen in some seyfert galaxies , this is likely to be due to relatively sparse and inhomogeneous distribution in the early - type host galaxies ( tadhunter 1990 ) .",
    "anisotropic agn - photoionization of the ambient ism is also a viable model for _ high - redshift _ radio galaxies .",
    "the detection of scattered light from a hidden quasar ( and also broad line components ) in the polarized flux of several hzrg is strong evidence for the existence of luminous quasars which illuminate the ism ( _ e.g. _ cimatti _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , dey _ et al .",
    "moreover , the presence of large diffuse halos of ionized gas in some hzrg , which extend far beyond the radio structures strongly suggests the existence of a quiescent ism ionized by the central agn ( _ eg . _ van ojik 1995 ) .",
    "mccarthy ( 1993 ) constructed a composite radio galaxy spectrum from observations of galaxies with 0.1@xmath63 .",
    "photoionization calculations reproduce the radio galaxy spectrum rather well and this was presented as an argument in favour of the agn photoionization as the main ionization mechanism in radio galaxies .",
    "however , the composite was built from the spectra of very different objects covering a wide range in redshift , and it is dominated by one or two of the most highly ionized objects .",
    "thus the comparison of this composite spectrum with the models does not resolve the issue of the ionization mechanism for the general population of hzrg .",
    "villar - martn et al .",
    "( hereafter vmbf96 ) concluded that photoionization by the agn can explain the positions of a large sample of hzrg in the civ@xmath71550/ly@xmath4 _ vs. _ civ@xmath71550/ciii ] @xmath71909 diagnostic diagram .",
    "the sequence defined by the data can be parametrized in terms of the so - called ionization parameter , that is , the ratio of the density of ionizing photons impinging on the slab to the density of the outermost gas layer of the slab :    @xmath8\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 is the speed of light , @xmath10 is the density of the gas in the front layer and @xmath11 is the lyman limit frequency .",
    "@xmath12 is the monochromatic ionizing energy flux impinging on the slab . by varying the ionization parameter it is possible to produce the variety observed in the uv line ratios of hzrg .",
    "a similar result is obtained at low @xmath13 : the sequences defined by the optical line ratios of powerful radio galaxies are explained in terms of a sequence defined by @xmath14 ( robinson et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "a possible alternative ionization mechanism in these sources is the ionization by fast shocks produced by violent interactions between the advancing radio jet and the ambient gas : there is already clear evidence for such jet - cloud interactions in hzrg .",
    "firstly , whereas the gas kinematics in most nearby radio galaxies are consistent with gravitational motions ( tadhunter _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ; baum _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) , extreme non - gravitational motions are observed along the radio axes in the majority of hzrg ( van ojik 1995 ; mccarthy _",
    "secondly , the extended emission line regions ( eelr ) are often not only aligned with the radio axis , but closely correlated in detail with the radio emission ( chambers _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ; miley _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ; rigler _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ; van ojik 1995 ) .",
    "even when there are no direct radio / optical associations , the degree of collimation seen in the narrow jet - like eelr along the radio axes of sources like 3c  368 and 3c  324 ( longair _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) is difficult to explain without invoking interactions between the line - emitting gas and the radio jets .",
    "the radio - optical asymmetries ( mccarthy _ et al .",
    "_ 1991 ) , the relationship between optical structure and radio size ( best _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) , and the fact that the extent of the line - emitting gas is almost always smaller than that of the associated radio source ( van ojik 1995 ) , provide further evidence for a close association between the radio plasma and the warm emission line gas .    recently , we have made a detailed study of the eelr in a sample of low  intermediate redshift radio galaxies which show clear morphological evidence for jet  cloud interactions ( tadhunter _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; clark & tadhunter 1996 ; clark 1996 ; clark _ et al .",
    "this study provides clear evidence that jet - induced shocks determine the distribution , kinematics and physical conditions of the eelr along the radio axes of the objects in the sample .",
    "there is also evidence that shocks have an ionizing effect in these sources : in particular , the high temperatures indicated by the the [ oiii]4363/(5007 + 4959 ) ratio , and the low heii(4686)/h@xmath15 ratio measured in the extended gas , are more consistent with shock - ionization than agn - photoionization .",
    "even complex multi - phase photoionization models such as those presented recently by binette _",
    "( 1996 ) and simpson & ward ( 1996 ) can not reproduce the measured values of these two line ratios .    with the above discussion in mind , it is imperative that the uv line ratios of hzrg be compared in detail with the predictions of both shock - ionization and agn - photoionization models .",
    "we have constructed a sample which comprises 21 narrow line radio galaxies at high  z ( most of them have @xmath52 ) for which the uv civ@xmath71550 , heii@xmath71640 and ciii]@xmath71909 emission lines have been measured .",
    "we have excluded those objects which show evidence of a blr . in table  1",
    ", we list the object names , the line ratios of interest to us here , the redshift and the reference to the observations .",
    "most of the data are taken from the recent thesis by van ojik ( 1995 ) which includes objects selected on the basis of a very steep radio spectrum .",
    "the other objects have been selected from the literature with the criteria of having high redshifts , classified as narrow line radio galaxies and with measured fluxes for the three uv lines mentioned above .",
    "the line measurements refer to the integrated emission from the object collected with a long slit aligned with the radio axis . we know that at this redshift , the line luminosities are generally dominated by the extranuclear emission and we can be confident that the general properties of the emitting gas inferred from the spectra describe the extended emitting regions , rather than the emission line regions close to the nuclei .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the flux of some of the lines is poorly determined and the errors in the line ratios are large .",
    "the most accurate ratio is oiii@xmath75007/oii@xmath73727 whose value is in very good agreement with the -1.0 power law model while the low metallicity model can not account for it .",
    "the high values of the ratios oii / h@xmath15 and oiii / h@xmath15 , if confirmed , are also in better agreement with the hard continuum model .",
    "it is clear that optical line ratios are able to discriminate between these two possibilities .",
    "the acquisition of good quality optical ( rest - frame ) spectra of the hzrg will be crucial to test if the models valid for the uv lines can also fit the optical line ratios .",
    "in the above discussion we used the uv emission lines as a diagnostic to distinguish between shock and agn photoionization in the eelr of powerful high redshift radio galaxies .    at @xmath16 redshifts ,",
    "most of the information we have comes from the optical emission lines .",
    "the most recent shock models developed by dopita and sutherland ( 1995,1996 ) produce , in general , optical line ratios which overlap with the -1.5 pl predictions .",
    "therefore , the _ optical _ emission lines do not provide a clear - cut way to distinguish between the mechanisms .",
    "however , the uv line ratios offer a powerful diagnostic for _ low _ redshift radio galaxies with _ low",
    "_ @xmath14 values ( log@xmath17 -2.0 ) . for _",
    "high _ @xmath14 values , the distinction is difficult , due to the overlap of the shock and -1.5 power law models ( see above ) , and the diagnostics become inefficient at the high ionization end of the diagram . a comparison of fig .",
    "1 and 3 reveals that the -1.5 power law with log@xmath17 -2.0 lie far from the shock models , due to the much fainter civ emission . while these agn photoionization models produce @xmath18 )",
    "\\leq$]0.5 and @xmath190.2 , the values for the shock models are @xmath201.0 and @xmath200.6 and respectively .    as mentioned before , observations of low redshift radio galaxies with strong jet / cloud interactions show that the emitting gas has a low ionization level ( clark & tadhunter 1996 ) .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by the lines emitted by the `` cool '' high density ( i.e. low ionization parameter ) gas behind the shock .",
    "therefore , they are suitable for the diagnostics .",
    "a good example is the radio galaxy pks2250 - 41 .",
    "al ( 1996 ) have presented clear evidence of the presence of a jet / cloud interaction in the eelr of this object both from imaging and optical spectroscopy .",
    "the optical line ratios indicate that log@xmath21  -3 .",
    "thus the measured uv line ratios have the potential to determine which mechanism dominates the emission line processes in the eelr of this object .",
    "the possibility of a -1.0 pl ionizing continuum is rejected because it does not explain the optical line ratios : shock and/or -1.5 pl ( or hot black body ) are the main possibilities .",
    "we have studied the uv line ratios of a sample of _ high _ redshift radio galaxies to understand which is the main mechanism responsible for the line emission processes .",
    "the models which reproduce the optical line ratios of low redshift eelr ( -1.5 power law or hot black body and solar abundances of the gas ) can not explain the uv line ratios of very high redshift radio galaxies . we have investigated several possibilities to explain these discrepancies . the most suggestive one , i.e. shocks produced in jet / cloud interactions , fails to explain the data .    on the contrary , a harder ionizing agn continuum ( power law of index @xmath4=-1 ) and the classical -1.5 power law with a low metallicity produce an excellent fit to the data . the first possibility is supported by the existing evidence of an evolution towards harder continuum at higher redshifts of the mean spectral shape of the agn continuum . the second possibility is supported by the evidence provided by studies of absorption line systems in the line of sight of quasars , which demonstrate abundance of @xmath220.1 solar at very high redshifts .",
    "the uv diagnostic diagrams do not distinguish unambiguously between jet - induced shocks and agn photoionization for the hzrg with @xmath23 ionization state because the two sets of models overlap in the diagrams .",
    "we note , however , that not only are the sequences on the diagnostic diagrams better explained in terms of photoionization , but the overall ionization state of the hzrg is considerably higher than is measured in well - studied jet  cloud interactions at lower redshifts .",
    "our result do not contradict the existence of shocks in these objects .",
    "rather it suggests that the continuum emitted by the central agn is the main ionizing source , with the shocks having an important effect on the kinematics and morphology of the gas .",
    "for the lower ionization states , the distinction between the shock and photoionization models is more clear - cut , and the uv diagnostic diagrams are a promising means of distinguishing the major ionization mechanism in the low redshift jet  cloud interaction candidates .",
    "finally , we note that it is always dangerous to base strong conclusions about the ionization mechanisms on measurements of just a few emission lines in a particular spectral range .",
    "our results are suggestive but not conclusive .",
    "it is now essential to check the consistency of the model results by obtaining spectra which cover diagnostics in _ both _ the optical and uv for individual high and low redshift radio galaxies ."
