    "motivated from mean - variance hedging ( see , e.g. , dai  @xcite ) and utility based optimal portfolio choice ( see , e.g. , becherer  @xcite , musiela and zariphopoulou  @xcite ) in finance , and multi - channel ( or multi - valued ) image regularization such as color images in computer vision and network application ( see , e.g. , caselles _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , tschumperl and deriche  @xcite , and references therein ) , we formulate a new class of spdes , named _ high - order vector b - spdes with jumps _ , which allow high - order integral - partial differential operators @xmath0 and @xmath1 into both drift and diffusion coefficients as shown in the following equation , @xmath2 where the operator @xmath0 depends not only on @xmath3 but also on their associated partial derivatives , i.e. , for each integer @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath1 are defined by @xmath7 under certain type of lipschitz and linear growth conditions , we prove the existence and uniqueness of adapted triplet solution @xmath8 to these b - spdes .",
    "when the partial differential operator @xmath0 depends only on @xmath9 , and @xmath10 but not on their associated derivatives and @xmath11 , our b - spdes with jumps reduce to conventional bsdes with jumps ( see , e.g. , becherer  @xcite , dai  @xcite , tang and li  @xcite ) .",
    "bsdes were first introduced by bismut  @xcite and the first result for the existence of an adapted solution to a continuous nonlinear bsde was obtained by pardoux and peng  @xcite . since then , numerous extensions along the line have been conducted , such as , tang and li  @xcite get the first adapted solution to a bsde with poisson jumps for a fixed terminal time and situ  @xcite extended the result to the case where the bsde is with bounded random stopping time as its terminal time and non - lipschitz coefficient .",
    "currently , bsdes are still an active area of research in both theory and applications , see , e.g. , becherer  @xcite , cohen and elliott  @xcite , crpey and matoussi  @xcite , dai  @xcite , lepeltier _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , yin and mao  @xcite , and references therein .",
    "the study on spdes receives a great attention recently ( see , e.g. , pardoux  @xcite and hairer  @xcite ) .",
    "particularly , pardoux and peng  @xcite introduces a system of semi - linear parabolic spde in a backward manner and establish the existence and uniqueness of adapted solution to the spde under smoothness assumptions on the coefficients , and moreover , the authors in @xcite also employ backward doubly sdes ( bdsde ) to provide a probabilistic representation for the parabolic sde .",
    "since then , numerous researches have been conducted in terms of weak solution and stationary solution to the semi - linear spde ( see , e.g. , bally and matoussi  @xcite , zhang and zhao  @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "however , our b - spdes exhibited in are fundamentally different from the spdes as introduced in pardoux and peng  @xcite and as studied in most of the existing researches in the following aspects : first , our system formulation is a direct generalization of the conventional bsdes , i.e. , both the drift and diffusion coefficients of our b - spdes depend on the triplet @xmath8 and its associated partial derivatives not just on @xmath12 and its associated partial derivatives ; second , our b - spdes are based on high - order partial derivatives and are subject to jumps .",
    "one special case of our b - spdes available in the literature is the one derived in musiela and zariphopoulou  @xcite for the purpose of optimal - utility based portfolio choice , which is strongly nonlinear in the sense that is addressed in lions and souganidis  @xcite .",
    "note that the b - spdes presented in are vector b - spdes with jumps , which are motivated from various aspects such as multi - channel image regularization in computer vision and network application through vector pdes ( see , e.g. , caselles _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , tschumperl and deriche  @xcite , and references therein ) , coupling and synchronization in random dynamic systems through vector spdes ( see , e.g. , mueller  @xcite , chueshov and schmalfu@xmath13  @xcite , and references therein ) .    to show our formulated system well - posed , we develop a method based on a scheme used for conventional bsdes ( see , e.g. , yong and zhou  @xcite ) to prove the existence and uniqueness of adapted solution to our b - spdes with jumps in under certain lipschitz and linear growth conditions .",
    "one fundamental issue we need to handle in the method is the differentiability of the triplet solution to our b - spdes with jumps , which is a subtle part in the analysis due to the inconsistency of differential orders on two sides of the b - spdes and the partial differential operators appeared in the diffusion coefficient .",
    "so more involved functional spaces and techniques are required .",
    "in addition , although there is no perfect theory in dealing with the strongly nonlinear spdes ( see , e.g. , pardoux  @xcite ) , our discussions about the adapted solution to can provide some reasonable interpretation concerning the unique existence of adapted solution before a random bankruptcy time to the strongly nonlinear b - spde derived in musiela and zariphopoulou  @xcite .    in the paper , we also provide some discussion concerning our b - spdes under random environment , e.g. , the variable @xmath14 in is replaced by a continuous markovian process @xmath15 . to be convenient for readers , we present a rough graph in figure  [ twouserregion ] with respect to sample surfaces for a solution to a b - spde and in terms of sample curves for a solution to the b - spde under random environment .",
    "= 3.0 in    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ finited ] , we first introduce a class of b - spdes with jumps in finite space domain , then we state and prove our main theorem . in section  [ infran ] ,",
