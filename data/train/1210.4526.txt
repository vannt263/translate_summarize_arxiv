    "many pulsars exist in binary systems , however , it is possible to have an isolated pulsar , in which case one needs to take care to properly enforce baryon number conservation .",
    "this happens because , differently from pulsars in binary systems which can accrete matter from a companion , isolated stars can not and , therefore , they conserve baryon number . in this case , as was previously shown in refs .",

    "[ bind ] and [ eos ] was constant in the @xmath15 direction with @xmath69 g. one expects a non - constant magnetic field whose magnitude decreases as one goes out from the center towards the edge of the star . to allow for this ,",

    "it ranges from a lower value set to @xmath71 g at small baryon chemical potentials ( densities ) to a higher value set to @xmath72 g at high baryon chemical potentials ( densities ) following the prescription from refs .",

    "the variable magnetic field prescription employed only significantly modifies the behavior of the system at high densities and therefore does not change the minimum of the binding energy . as explained in @xcite , stronger magnetic fields are necessary at larger densities in order to conserve the magnetic flux . for an alternative explanation of how the magnetic field strength increases toward the center of the star see @xcite .",
    "the effects of considering a variable magnetic field can be seen in fig  [ eos2 ] , where the eos is shown .",
    "they only become visible at high densities .",
    "it is important to notice that the magnetic field in the center of the star never reaches @xmath77 , but only @xmath78 .",
    "this happens because the stars become gravitationally unstable for higher central chemical potentials .",
    "g.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we can ask ourselves if it would make sense to increase the magnetic field further than we have already done .",
    "the answer is probably not .",
    "beyond @xmath79 g the parallel pressure ( now including the field contribution ) begins to become negative in the center of the star , even using the variable magnetic field prescription . according to ref .",

    "having obtained the eos for the system including magnetic field effects we can use this as input to the tov equations @xcite as long as @xmath83 .",
    "we will use the transverse pressure to solve tov equation .",
    "this should be a good approximation when @xmath84 ; otherwise , one should also include the breaking of spherical symmetry in the solution of the gravitational metric .",
    "we will consider two different central magnetic fields of @xmath85 g and @xmath86 g , the latter of which is close to @xmath87 .",
    "the results can be seen in the mass - radius diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ mass ] . without magnetic field effects , the maximum mass decreases with time from ( i ) to ( ii ) as the star deleptonizes and becomes more isospin symmetric ( due to charge neutrality ) .",
    "actually , the star has more up than down quarks at ( i ) . from ( ii ) to ( iii ) the star s maximum mass decreases again as it becomes cold and loses thermal energy .",
    "on the other hand , when the ( variable ) magnetic field effects are included , the maximum mass increases with time , from ( i ) to ( ii ) and from ( ii ) to ( iii ) .",
    "the difference in the possible star masses between different snapshots is also larger and all stars are more massive .",
    "the bulk of these effects come from the inclusion of the magnetic field in the pressure and energy density .",
    "the analysis above works only for stars that are in binary systems , and therefore can change baryon number with time . in order to analyze isolated stars ,",
    "we need to constrain the star baryon number by the one at its first moment of evolution ( i ) .",
    "as can be seen in table [ table ] the maximum masses of stars in all cases now decrease with time .",
    "this result agrees with similar hadronic calculations @xcite .",
    "the corresponding radii , on the other hand increase with time .",
    "it is interesting to notice that within this analysis , the magnetic field in the center of stars from stages ( ii ) and ( iii ) only reaches about @xmath88 .",
    "the data from table  [ table ] with fixed baryon number is also represented by symbols in fig .  [ mass ] .     included , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    it is important to note that we assume that the magnetic field is constant in time in the analysis of different snapshots of the quark star evolution .",
    "such an assumption is reasonable considering that the timescale for the magnetic field decays is of the order of @xmath89 years @xcite .",
    "this should be contrasted with the timescale for the cooling of proto - neutron stars which is on the order of minutes .",
    "in this paper we have examined the effect of strong magnetic fields on proto - quark stars using the mit bag model .",
    "three situations were investigated : ( i ) fixed entropy per baryon @xmath60 with trapped neutrinos , ( ii ) @xmath61 without neutrinos and ( iii ) a zero temperature system with no neutrinos .",
    "the pressure anisotropy inherent to fermi gases in external magnetic fields was obtained both for fixed magnetic fields and for a scenario where the magnetic field varies with the baryon chemical potential .",
    "the conditions for chemical equilibrium between the quarks , leptons , and neutrinos were enforced . in the case of isolated proto - quark stars we incorporated the effect of baryon number conservation during its evolution .",

    "the maximum magnetic field generated in the star s interior at stage ( i ) of the evolution is on the order of @xmath93 .",
    "for the lower value of the magnetic field considered , this places us well below @xmath87 where the longitudinal pressure of the system becomes negative .",
    "in addition , the level of pressure anisotropy in this case is relatively small with @xmath94 , giving us some confidence in the use of isotropic tov equations which assume @xmath95 . for the larger value of the magnetic field studied ,",
    "we find that the longitudinal pressure is still positive ; however , the level of pressure anisotropy is quite large with @xmath96 . in this second case",
    ", it is questionable whether isotropic tov is sufficient to draw firm numerical conclusions ; however , as we have demonstrated , the qualitative behavior and pattern of evolution observed with this larger magnitude of the magnetic field are similar to those obtained with the smaller magnitude magnetic field .    additionally , our results show clearly that the mit bag model for a @xmath97 mev obtained from an investigation of the adequate stability window @xcite can not reproduce the very massive neutron star recently detected @xcite , not even if very intense magnetic fields are considered .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising since most models which are able to describe large mass stars rely on the existence of additional repulsive ( vector ) interactions .",
    "that being said , it is interesting to consider the effect of a magnetic field in the somewhat simple bag model in order to establish a baseline for other models .",
    "finally , we note that although the results presented imply that quark stars with @xmath98 g are only mildly anisotropic , larger central magnetic fields cause the pressures to become increasingly anisotropic",
    ". therefore , at such values of the magnetic field one should solve einstein s equations in an axisymmetric metric which is determined self - consistently from the axisymmetric energy - momentum tensor for the star .",
    "numerical solution for the axisymmetric case is needed and we are currently working towards this goal .",
    "other issues to investigate in the future are , for example , the inclusion of the effect of the anomalous magnetic moment and to further refine the stability windows for the bag model in the presence of a background magnetic field .",

    "<S> we use the mit bag model to analyze different stages of magnetized quark star evolution incorporating baryon number conservation and an anisotropic energy momentum tensor . </S>",
    "<S> the first stages of the evolution are simulated through the inclusion of trapped neutrinos and fixed entropy per particle , while in the last stage the star is taken to be deleptonized and cold . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , although strong magnetic fields allow for more massive quark stars , the evolution of isolated stars needs to be constrained by fixed baryon number , which lowers the star masses . moreover , magnetic field effects , measured by the difference between the parallel and perpendicular pressures , are more pronounced in the beginning of the star evolution when there is a larger number of charged leptons and up quarks . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that having a spatially varying magnetic field allows for larger magnetic fields to be supported since the model employed generates large magnetic fields only at high densities , where the longitudinal matter pressure is large enough to partially compensate for the negative magnetic field longitudinal pressure . </S>"
