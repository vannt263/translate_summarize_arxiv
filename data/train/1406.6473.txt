    "speech coding is the encoding of speech signals to enable transmission at bit rates lower than that of the original digitized speech .",
    "the human auditory system can capture only certain aspects of a speech signal .",
    "thus , perceptually relevant information of a speech signal can be extracted to produce an equivalent - sounding wave at a much lower bandwidth .",
    "linear prediction is a widely used compression technique in which past samples of a signal are stored and used to predict the next sample @xcite . in the basic linear predictive coder prototype",
    ", prediction is done over a time interval of one pitch period using adaptive linear delay and gain factors .",
    "this basic prototype produces intelligible but artificial - sounding speech output , and various techniques have been researched to improve the perceptual quality .",
    "variants to the linear prediction coders are code excited linear prediction ( celp ) and low - delay celp ( ld - celp ) which use forward and backward linear prediction respectively , along with the _ codebooks _ ,",
    "i.e. lookup tables with codevectors corresponding to speech residual signals @xcite . in mixed excitation linear prediction ( melp )",
    "@xcite , an additional classification of speech is introduced - the jittery voiced speech .",
    "mixed excitation , i.e the mixing of periodic and noise excitation , is another distinguishing feature of the melp model .",
    "this paper aims at comparing the three types of linear prediction based vocoders in terms of their bit rate and perceptual quality . in comparing vocoders ,",
    "subjective testing of the voice quality is a major step in the evaluation of a vocoder .",
    "a vocoder will finally be accepted in the market only if humans are satisfied with the voice quality .",
    "keeping this fact in consideration , subjective evaluation using the mean opinion score ( mos ) test has been conducted .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii gives a brief overview of the vocoder algorithms .",
    "the bit allocation and bit rate calculations are also described .",
    "section iii describes the method adopted in implementing and testing the vocoder .",
    "the results obtained and their implications are discussed in section iv , followed by concluding remarks .",
    "the linear prediction model forms the core of the celp , ld - celp and melp algorithms , as depicted in fig .  [ fig : core ] . in the lpc model",
    ", speech signals are classified into voiced and unvoiced signals .",
    "voiced signals are generated when the vocal cords vibrate and are represented in the lpc source - filter model as periodic excitation .",
    "unvoiced signals are generated by turbulence of air in the vocal tract and do not involve the vocal cords .",
    "these signals are usually represented as white gaussian noise .",
    "the lpc coder consists of a linear predictor having adaptive delay and gain factors @xcite .",
    "since there are sounds in speech that are produced by a combination of voiced and unvoiced signals , it has been observed that important perceptual speech information gets missed out from the predictor output .",
    "also a slight error in the predictor coefficients will lead to more speech information being missed out .",
    "this unaccounted residual output of the lpc coder contains important data on how the sound signal is perceived by the human auditory system .",
    "it was proposed in @xcite that the prediction residual signal could be used to enhance the perceptual quality of the coder output .",
    "a codebook containing a list of codevectors is searched to obtain a closest match to the residual signal .",
    "the index of the codevector is selected such that minimization of the perceptually weighted error metric is obtained .",
    "the codec earned its name due to the use of codebooks to obtain _ codes _ for modeling the speech signal .",
    "the same codebook is available at both the transmitter and the receiver . at the receiver",
    ", the index is used to obtain the codevector and use it in the synthesis filters .",
    "celp uses the analysis - by - synthesis ( abs ) method in which the transmitter _ analyzes _ the signal to produce linear prediction coefficients , and then uses these coefficients to _ synthesize _ the speech signal within the transmitter itself .",
    "an error signal is generated and codevectors are selected from the codebook in order to minimize the perceptually weighted mean square error . in the celp transmitter ,",
    "the transmitter first splits the input speech into frames of around 30 ms .",
    "short - term linear prediction is performed , i.e. formants ( peaks of the spectral envelope ) are estimated for each input frame .",
    "the transfer function of the perceptual weighting filter of celp is given by the following equation .",
    "@xmath0 where    @xmath1    @xmath2    where m is the lpc predictor order and @xmath3 s are the quantized lpc coefficients . after finding the short term lpc coefficients , each frame",
    "is split into four subframes , i.e. 7.5 ms each , which are given as input to the long - term prediction filter .",
    "the pitch and the intensity of the speech signal are estimated .",
    "an optional post filtering stage may be added after decoding to enhance the quality of the output signal .",
    "the celp bit allocation @xcite is shown below :    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the time domain waveforms , it can be concluded that the overall shape of the original wave has been preserved .",
    "however peaks have been clipped at certain portions which result in decrease in clarity of the speech output .",
    "the spectrograms show the frequency content of the speech waveforms as a function of time .",
    "the pitch and intensity graphs also show slight variations in the output of the vocoders .",
    "reliable estimates of the perceptual quality can be made only by conducting subjective tests using human listeners .",
    "all recorded input speech files were sampled at a rate of 8 khz .",
    "the details of speech input files are shown in table  [ tab : in_speech_files ] .",
    "the average input speech file size was 393.6 kb and average duration 24.59s .",
    "the mos scores corresponding to each input speech file and the average mos score obtained for each vocoder are shown in table  [ tab : mos ] .",
    "the mos scores in table  [ tab : mos ] show that ld - celp has the highest perceptual quality ( toll quality ) among the three vocoders .",
    "the perceptual quality of celp and melp vocoders is rated less , with celp scoring slightly higher than melp .",
    "the results of the comparison indicate that a choice can be made only based on the application of the vocoder . in applications where the focus is on low delay and high perceptual quality , as in two - way communication systems , the ld - celp algorithm at 16",
    "kb / s is the ideal candidate . in areas where low bit rate is essential",
    ", melp is the best candidate because it can work at bit rates as low as 2.4 kb / s and gives intelligible output .",
    "when both low bit rate and good quality are required , the celp coder at 4.8 kb / s seems to be the most suitable coder . in this study ,",
    "the number of evaluators for the mos test was limited to 10 due to time constraints . for more accurate results ,",
    "the number of evaluators needs to be increased .",
    "the authors would like to thank the students and faculty of the department for providing speech samples and for their participation in the mean opinion score testing .",
    "special thanks goes to karthika balan for her valuable help in the mos testing process .",
