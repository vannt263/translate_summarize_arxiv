    "<S> the formation of large scale coherent structures is widely observed in atmospheric and oceanic flows and ascribed to the nearly bi - dimensional nature of these flows . </S>",
    "<S> kraichnan showed that in two - dimensional ( 2d ) turbulence , the energy is transferred from the forcing scale to larger scales due to the conservation of both energy and enstrophy by the inviscid dynamics @xcite . in a confined flow domain and without large scale friction , </S>",
    "<S> the energy accumulates at the largest possible scale , thus generating coherent structures in the form of large scale vortices .    it has been observed in laboratory experiments that the large scale circulation generated by forcing a nearly @xmath0d flow at small scale can display random reversals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the large scale velocity has a bimodal probability density function ( pdf ) with two symmetric maxima related to the opposite signs of the large scale circulation . </S>",
    "<S> this regime bifurcates from another turbulent regime with a gaussian velocity field with zero mean when the large scale friction is decreased . </S>",
    "<S> when the friction is decreased further , the reversals become less and less frequent and a condensed state with most of its kinetic energy in the large scale circulation is reached @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a similar sequence of transitions is observed in numerical simulations of the @xmath0d navier - stokes equation ( nse ) with large scale friction and spatially periodic forcing @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> these transitions correspond to bifurcations of a mean flow on a strongly turbulent background for which no theoretical tool exists so far . </S>",
    "<S> we show in this letter that the truncated euler equation ( tee ) , _ i_.e . a finite set of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) for the amplitude of the large - scale modes without forcing and dissipation , can correctly describe these transitions . to wit , we compare the dynamical regimes observed in numerical simulations of the @xmath0d nse with the ones obtained with the tee when the characteristic scale @xmath2 of the initial conditions is changed , with @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the kinetic energy of the flow and @xmath5 is its enstrophy ( integrated squared vorticity ) </S>",

    "<S> microcanonical distributions are defined by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are respectively the energy and enstrophy of the initial conditions , and should be used to compute the pdfs in the reversal and condensed state ( see below ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the tee is obtained by performing a circular galerkin truncation at wave - number @xmath43 of the incompressible , euler equation @xmath44 , which is eq .   without forcing or dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> the tee in spectral space reads @xmath45 with @xmath46 the kronecker delta and with fourier modes satisfying @xmath47 if @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> note that , because of the free - slip boundary conditions eq .  , the fourier modes @xmath49 are real numbers . </S>",
    "<S> this truncated system exactly conserves the quadratic invariants , energy and enstrophy , given in fourier space by @xmath50 and @xmath51 .    for tee </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath43 as a free parameter and the same stream function expansion as that used for the ns eq .  </S>",
    "<S> , thus the numerical integration method is the same as the one described above for the nse . in both cases , the minimum wavenumber is @xmath52 . </S>",

    "<S> the effect of the large scale friction is to stop the inverse cascade before reaching the scale of the flow domain . </S>",

    "<S> when @xmath33 is large ( small friction ) , the kinetic energy accumulates at the scale of the flow domain and the condensed state is obtained .    </S>",
    "<S> although , we do not have a quantitative agreement between the transition values for @xmath54 for the tee and @xmath33 for the nse when using the relation between @xmath54 and @xmath33 displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](c ) , the same sequence of transitions is observed in both cases . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:1](d ) shows that we keep this qualitative agreement when the truncation is lower , @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> this truncation leads to only @xmath1 odes for the amplitudes of the large scale modes ( see supplemental material  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that this set of equations correctly describes the transitions observed between the different turbulent regimes observed in direct numerical simulations and experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> the tee model   is a finite number of quadratic nonlinear odes for real variables @xmath59 ( see the remark following eq .   about the amplitudes of the fourier modes noted @xmath59 hereafter to simplify the notations ) that conserve both the energy @xmath60 and the enstrophy @xmath61 ( see supplemental material  @xcite ) . by making use of the identities @xmath62 and @xmath63 we can write the total microcanonical phase space volume @xmath64 as @xmath65 with @xmath66 using the steepest descent method @xcite on the integral eq .  </S>",

    "<S> we can estimate the same way the phase space volume for a fixed value of @xmath72 by retracing the steps from eq .   to , but with the product and sums going from @xmath73 to @xmath74 instead of @xmath75 to @xmath74 . by combining these parametric representations </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain an explicit expression for the normalized pdf of @xmath72 that is shown in fig.[fig:1](d ) and displays a good agreement with the numerical results .    </S>",
    "<S> note that canonical distributions with quadratic invariants are gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> when there is condensation of energy at large scale , only a few modes are present and then the canonical distribution has no reason to reproduce the microcanonical distribution results  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 implies that @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the microcanonical pdf of @xmath72 has to obey @xmath80 for @xmath81 which forbids reversals of the large scale circulation . </S>",
    "<S> this represents ergodicity breakdown . </S>",
    "<S> our above results show that this breakdown is preceded by an ergodicity delay , in the sense that @xmath82 becomes very small @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the later result is expected since there exists a critical value of @xmath54 below which reversals are not possible in order to fulfill the conservation of both @xmath4 and @xmath5 . </S>",

    "<S> + although it can be expected that viscous dissipation is negligible for the dynamics of large scales , it is remarkable that taking into account the effect of large scale friction by selecting the value of @xmath87 in the initial conditions of the tee is enough to describe the bifurcations of the large scale flow using a small number of modes governed by the euler equation . </S>",
