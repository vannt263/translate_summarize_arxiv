    "hierarchical @xmath15cdm ( hlcdm ) models provide a successful paradigm for the growth of dark matter on large scales , but predictions of how galaxies evolve depend on the baryonic merger history , star formation , feedback , and other aspects of the baryonic physics . in this paper",
    ", we provide empirical constraints on the frequency of mergers and interactions , and their impact on the star formation ( sf ) of galaxies over the last seven gyr ( jogee et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "our sample consists of @xmath3  4500 galaxies with @xmath16 24 over the redshift interval @xmath8  0.240.80 ( lookback @xmath17  @xmath3  37 gyr and @xmath18 = 70  km  s@xmath10  mpc@xmath10 . ] ) , drawn from the galaxy evolution from morphology and seds ( gems ; rix et al .",
    "2004 ) survey .",
    "we use _ hst _ acs f606w ( @xmath19 ) images from gems , accurate spectrophotometric redshifts [ @xmath20/(1 + @xmath21 )  @xmath3  0.02 down to @xmath22 = 24 ] from combo-17 ( wolf et al .",
    "2004 ) , stellar masses based on combo-17 ( borch et al .",
    "2006 ) , and star formation rates ( bell et al .",
    "2007 ) based on combo-17 uv and spitzer data .",
    "we visually classified galaxies in the f606w images into the following two main visual classes ( vcs ) . ( 1 ) ` dist ' : this vc contains strongly disturbed galaxies with _ externally - triggered _ distortions indicative of a recent strong tidal interaction or merger .",
    "the distortions include arcs , shells , ripples , tidal debris , warps , offset rings , extremely asymmetric light distributions , tidal tails , and multiple nuclei inside a common body .",
    "( 2 ) ` normal ' : this vc contains the remaining galaxies .",
    "it includes e / s0 , sa , and sb - sd galaxies with no significant _ externally - triggered _ distortions , and the class `` irr1 '' of galaxies with _ internally - triggered _ asymmetries described below .",
    "many non - interacting galaxies have some low level of small - scale asymmetry in their rest - frame @xmath19 or @xmath23 band light due to star - forming regions or due to the low ratio of rotational to random velocities in low mass systems ( e.g. , in local i m and sm galaxies ) .",
    "these internally - triggered asymmetries differ in scale ( few 100 pc vs several kpc ) and morphology from the externally - triggered distortions listed in ( 1 ) .",
    "we also ran the cas code ( conselice et al .",
    "2000 ) on the the f606w images to derive asymmetry ( a ) , and clumpiness ( s ) parameters .",
    "the cas criterion ( @xmath24  0.35 and @xmath25 ) picks up only 37% to 58% of the strongly disturbed dist galaxies , as expected from simulations ( conselice 2006 ) .",
    "however , it is also contaminated by a significant number of relatively normal galaxies .",
    "the visual classification was performed by three classifiers to measure the dispersion .",
    "the largest uncertainties in the vcs are in the last bin ( @xmath8  0.6 to 0.8 ) due to surface brightness dimming and due to the rest frame wavelength ( @xmath26 ) shifting to the violet / near - uv ( 3700 to 3290  ) .",
    "we addressed these by verifying that the vcs of most strongly disturbed and normal galaxies do not change when we repeat the classification in all 4 bins using the deep goods f850lp images , whose redder pivot wavelength ( 9103  ) , ensures that @xmath26  @xmath12  5000   in all bins .",
    "further tests , including monte carlo simulations and comparisons with hudf images are under way .",
    "we summarize our current results below :    fig .",
    "1 shows the color - mass distribution of the sample . out to @xmath8  0.8 , the req sequence is complete for high mass ( @xmath27  @xmath6 @xmath7 ; @xmath28=804 ) galaxies ( borch et al .",
    "2006 ) , while the blue cloud is complete for intermediate mass ( @xmath27  @xmath13 @xmath7 ; @xmath28=3864 ) systems .",
    "the strongly disturbed ( dist ) galaxies , coded as orange stars , lie on both the red sequence and blue cloud .    the observed fraction @xmath4 of strongly disturbed systems among high mass ( @xmath5  @xmath6 @xmath7 ) galaxies is @xmath3  8% to 12% in each gyr bin over @xmath0   0.240.80 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "similar results are reported by lotz et al .",
    "the corresponding merger rate is @xmath3   a few @xmath9 galaxies gyr@xmath10 mpc@xmath11 .",
    "fig .  2 compares the observed fraction @xmath4 with the fraction of major mergers ( m1/m2  @xmath12  1:4 ; dashed lines ) and major+minor mergers ( m1/m2  @xmath12  1:10 ; solid lines ) predicted by lcdm - based semi - analytical ( sa ) , n - body , and sph simulations , namely hopkins et al .",

    "there is fair agreement between @xmath4 and the predicted fraction of mergers with m1/m2  @xmath12  1:10 .",
    "_ 4 . _ among @xmath5  @xmath13 @xmath7 systems over @xmath0  0.240.80 , the average sfr of strongly disturbed systems is only modestly enhanced with respect to normal galaxies over this redshift range ( fig .  3 ; see also robaina et al . in prep . ) .",
    "this modest enhancement is consistent with a recent statistical studies of the sf efficiency from based on large sets of numerical simulations ( di matteo et al 2007 ) .",
    "in fact , for this mass range , strongly disturbed systems only account for a small fraction ( @xmath14 30% ) of the cosmic sfr density over @xmath8  0.240.80 ( fig .  4 ) .",
