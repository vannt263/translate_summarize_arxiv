    "the structural and dynamical properties of bulk supercooled liquids are now relatively well understood in the range close to the crossover temperature of the mode coupling theory of the evolution of glassy dynamics , mct .",
    "@xcite this theory describes , in its ideal version , the relaxation mechanism of supercooled liquids as mastered by the cage effect . the motion of atoms or molecules is restricted by the presence of nearest neighbors that surround and trap the tagged particle forming a cage around it",
    "when the cage relaxes , due to cooperative motion , the particle diffuses .",
    "relaxation times of the cage diverge on approaching a temperature @xmath0 where , in this framework , the liquid undergoes a structural arrest . in most liquids this dynamical singularity is avoided since close to @xmath0 the hopping relaxation channel opens .",
    "the temperature of glass transition is reached when also hopping is frozen . in this context @xmath0 remains an important temperature that marks the ideal crossover from a regime mastered by the cage effect to one mastered by hopping effects .",
    "this crossover temperature can be estimated through an mct analysis of dynamical properties of the liquid both with experiments and computer simulations .",
    "relaxation modes described by mct are cooperative in character .",
    "cooperativity is a basic concept in several theories and models of the glass transition .",
    "the existence of cooperative rearranging regions , crr , intimately related to dynamic heterogeneities , can be a possible interpretative mechanism for the approach to the glass transition .",
    "@xcite the extent of the crr is expected to increases with decreasing temperature . in the presence of a restricted environment the behavior of these regions",
    "might be modified and this might imply a change of the dynamical behavior .",
    "confinement can therefore offer possible clues for a better understanding of general mechanisms for the glass transitions in the bulk .    to assess the validity and the possible limits of applicability of mct in confinement can help to bridge the concepts of hopping , caging and dynamical heterogeneities .",
    "these phenomena appear in fact all fundamental ingredients for the glass transition to occur .",
    "only very few computer simulation studies on the applicability of mct on supercooled liquids in confined geometries are available .",
    "@xcite a detailed comparison of the dynamics of a glass former in the bulk and in a confined state can give new insights in understanding the behavior of the supercooled liquids .",
    "this comparison can nonetheless be quantitatively carried out only if it is performed at equivalent thermodynamical conditions .    in this paper",
    "we consider one of the most studied model for glass former liquids , a lennard jones binary mixture , ljbm , which is known to test mct in its bulk phase  @xcite .",
    "we carry on a direct comparison between a set of simulations that we have previously published of the ljbm confined in a disordered array of soft spheres  @xcite and an equivalent bulk phase .",
    "the ljbm hosted by the matrix is in a strong confining environment where a large fraction of particles are interfacial  @xcite .",
    "this microporous medium can be considered a model for real compounds like silica xerogels.@xcite the confined liquid has been found in our previous works to test mct .",
    "@xcite recently the mean square displacement results for this system have also been found to fit in the framework of a recently proposed mean field theory of the glass transition .",
    "@xcite    a difficulty to face in the comparison with the bulk is the presence of variations of the local density of the confined ljbm as a function of temperature due to the soft sphere repulsive potential .",
    "there is not a unique way to define a free volume .",
    "@xcite therefore , in order to obtain a quantitative comparison of the dynamical properties we performed here computer simulations of the bulk liquid along a thermodynamical path where the @xmath1 values follow the isochore obtained for the confined system upon supercooling .",
    "this implies that for the bulk phase analyzed in this paper the approach to @xmath0 is not obtained along isochoric , isobaric or isothermal paths , as usually done for bulk glass formers .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in the next section we present the details of the newly performed bulk simulations , and a brief description of the previously studied confined ljbm .",
    "the third section describes the behavior of the density correlators in the @xmath2 relaxation region . the fourth section explores the role of hopping in bulk compared to confinement .",
    "the fifth section presents an analysis of dynamical clusters in the two systems .",
    "last section is devoted to conclusions .",
    "we report data analysis obtained from molecular dynamics simulations trajectories of a lennard - jones 80:20 binary mixture ( ljbm ) defined as in ref .   in the bulk phase .",

    "@xcite : @xmath135 which is the relative deviation between the @xmath136 obtained from simulations and the value it should have if @xmath137 was gaussian .",
    "the non gaussian parameter can be studied in order to quantify the effects of dynamic heterogeneity , as hopping processes , and it can also be obtained experimentally from the q - dependence of the debye waller factor .",
    "@xcite    in figure [ fig:13 ] , @xmath138 is shown as a function of @xmath117 for a and b particles for different temperatures . the same result for the confined system is reported for comparison  @xcite .",
    "we note that the @xmath138 behavior for both systems is similar to that found in several other simulations on bulk liquids close to glass transition  @xcite : @xmath138 increases significantly in the late @xmath139 relaxation region , near the onset of the @xmath2 relaxation , where it reaches its maximum , then it decays to zero as @xmath140 .",
    "furthermore , a master curve is found overlapping the individual curves in a time interval just before they attain their maximum .",
    "however we note that , in our confined system , such master curve is considerably less defined than in the bulk .    in the bulk system",
    "the non gaussian parameter appears very different for @xmath3 and @xmath4 particles and never exceeds the value of @xmath141 for @xmath3 particles .",
    "this can be connected to the observed negligible hopping above @xmath0 for @xmath3 particles . in the confined system we have instead similar parameters for @xmath3 and @xmath4 particles and their values grow substantially as we supercool . for the lowest temperature investigated in confinement",
    "the peak heights are around @xmath142 .",
    "hopping appears therefore to cause a much more marked deviation from gaussianity than mct behavior and it also seems to lead to a disappearance of the master curve .",
    "extensive investigations of ljbm with a large number of particles have shown recently the important role of the cooperative molecular motion in the interpretation of the slow dynamics and the behavior of the relaxation in liquids upon supercooling close to @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite we expect that confinement induces modifications in the crr mechanism .",
    "we have investigated for our ljbm both in bulk and in confined phases the possible existence of a spatially correlated dynamics .",
    "an estimate of the typical distance of the particles correlation can be obtained from an analysis of clusters of nearest neighbors . in our analysis",
    "two particles belong to the same cluster if the maximum distance they reach from each other within a fixed time @xmath143 is less equal than @xmath144 where @xmath145 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:14 ] we show the distribution functions of the size of the number of particles , @xmath146 of the dynamical clusters for different time ranges @xmath143 used in the sampling at different temperatures .",
    "we observe that in the bulk the larger clusters , corresponding to the shorter fixed times , arrive to circa @xmath147 particles and that at the lowest temperature investigated the distribution function of the clusters remains unchanged up to @xmath148 . in confinement",
    "the maximum size of the clusters does not exceed @xmath149 particles and persists only for a very short time also for the lowest temperature . in the bulk a very precise analysis of these spatial correlations has been already carried out for the same ljbm .",
    "the authors use a much larger sample and are able to distinguish between mobile and immobile particles .",
    "@xcite both these kind of particles show a distribution of the sizes similar to what found in our smaller bulk sample . comparing our analysis of the bulk and confined systems",
    "we observe that in confinement spatial correlations are strongly depressed .",
    "this can be connected to the fact that at variance with the bulk in the confined system hopping mechanisms intervene while cages are still relaxing .",
    "the authors of ref .   in their study of the bulk phase of the ljbm",
    "underline in fact the importance of subsequential relaxation processes for spatially correlated dynamics . at",
    "any given time most particles are localized in cages and a small fraction forms cooperative strings . once rearranged these particles become caged and others become mobile .",
    "the clarification of this point needs further investigation and can be possibly connected with the behavior of the inherent structures in confinement .",
    "we performed an accurate study of the behavior of a ljbm upon supercooling .",
    "the system has been studied along the thermodynamical path corresponding to the isochoric path of a previous study of the same liquid in confinement . in this way we could carry out a quantitative comparison between the two systems .",
    "the analysis of the density correlators in the alpha - relaxation region shows that the mct predictions are satisfied by our bulk system that approaches the critical curve upon decreasing temperature with a path where the volume is not constant .    on comparing the sisf of the bulk with the confined one we have confirmed and quantified the differences and analogies between the two systems that we did hypothize in our previous studies  @xcite .",
    "in particular we have observed a difference in the slope of the tail of the correlators and a much less defined plateau in confinement .",
    "this leads to a substantially lower value of the stretching parameter @xmath139 . besides the @xmath139 values do not reach a constant value upon decreasing temperature at variance with those of the bulk liquid .",
    "the crossover temperature in the confined case is lower with respect to bulk .",
    "discrepancies with the mct predictions for the exponent @xmath49 determining the asymptotic behavior of the relaxation time and the diffusion coefficient are found to be more marked in confinement .",
    "this can be ascribed to the hopping phenomenon that in confinement plays above and near @xmath0 a more significant role than in the bulk . in the bulk in fact",
    "hopping effects appear only for the smaller @xmath4 particles and in a time range well distinct from the time range of the cage effect . in confinement",
    "we observe hopping effects for both species of particles in a time scale that coincides with the time scale of caging . as a consequence mct behavior",
    "is partially hidden .",
    "in fact the ttsp is verified also in confinement but in a much smaller range of temperatures , analogously to the power law behavior .",
    "also the prediction that the exponent @xmath101 extracted from the von schweidler should be the same for @xmath3 and @xmath4 particles is verified only in confinement .",
    "hopping effects determine deviation from gaussianity more marked in confinement than in bulk .",
    "the non gaussian parameters are different for @xmath3 and @xmath4 particles in the bulk but they are very similar in confinement .",
    "finally our comparison of the cluster dynamics in confinement and in bulk shows that clusters in the confined system have smaller sizes and last shorter time than in the bulk .",
    "further analysis of cooperativity in confined glass former would require to study larger systems , but present results show that in the presence of a restricted environment cooperativity is at least partially inhibited ."
