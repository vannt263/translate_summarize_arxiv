    "in this paper , we consider an equation named after two important topics in the field of integrable systems  the kp hierarchy and the ultradiscrete systems .",
    "the kp hierarchy @xcite is a sequence of equations generated from a bilinear identity and plays an important role in the construction of a unified theory for integrable systems . by applying a transformation for the independent variables called the miwa transformation ,",
    "the kp hierarchy is rewritten in the form of the discrete kp hierarchy @xcite .",
    "the fundamental equation in the discrete kp hierarchy is a trinomial equation known as the hirota - miwa equation @xcite .",
    "it is known that all equations in the discrete kp hierarchy are generated by such trinomial equations @xcite and that most discrete integrable equations are obtained by taking some reduction for this equation .",
    "ultradiscrete systems are difference equations in which only @xmath0 and @xmath1 operators appear and which are obtained by a limiting procedure @xcite from canonical difference equations .",
    "the remarkable point of this procedure is that it preserves the good properties of integrable systems , although the dependent variables only take discrete values .",
    "the most famous example is the box and ball system ( bbs ) @xcite , which is a cellular automaton consisting of an infinite sequence of boxes and a finite amount of balls .",
    "the bbs has solitons and an infinite amount of conserved quantities and is obtained by the ultradiscretization of the kdv equation .",
    "it is an interesting problem to try to obtain the structure of the solutions to ultradiscrete soliton equations , as opposed to those of ordinary soliton equations . in previous papers @xcite , we proposed a recursive representation which corresponds to the notion of vertex operators , to several ultradiscrete analogues of soliton equations including the ultradiscrete kp equation .",
    "as an analogue of determinant - type solutions , the ultradiscretization of signature - free determinants is discussed in @xcite and the relationship between this type of solution and ultradiscrete soliton equations is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the establishment of relationships to other mathematical topics is also studied , for example , algebro - geometrical @xcite and combinatorial theories @xcite .",
    "recently , finding exact solutions to specific ultradiscrete systems became an active field of research .",
    "for example , negative soliton solutions were found in the analysis of the bbs with generalized dependent variables @xcite .",
    "we previously solved the initial value problem of this equation including negative solitons @xcite .",
    "soliton solutions with periodic phase term are presented in @xcite .",
    "such solutions do not appear in discrete integrable equations .    in this paper",
    ", we first propose yet another solution of the ultradiscrete kp equation .",
    "we secondly extend this solution to that of the ultradiscrete kp hierarchy and the non - autonomous one .",
    "we next discuss ultradiscrete specific solutions called backgrounds to this equation .",
    "finally , as an application , we consider the background solutions of the bbs with carrier ( bbsc ) , express this cellular automata as a lax form and discuss its compatibility condition .",
    "it is expected that the ultradiscrete kp hierarchy can be the master equation of the ultradiscrete as well as discrete systems .",
    "we define @xmath2 by @xmath3 for @xmath4 given by @xmath5 . here , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are parameters satisfying @xmath8 @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "[ mainthm ] @xmath2 satisfies equations : @xmath15    the first equation ( [ ukphier1 ] ) does not depend on @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "then , by regarding @xmath16 and @xmath17 as parameters , this equation is the ultradiscrete kp equation we proposed in @xcite . we shall call this equation the ultradiscrete kp equation for the variables ( @xmath18 ) . by focusing on variables",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath19 and regarding the other variables as constants , the function ( [ defkphtau ] ) is equal to the solutions we proposed previously in @xcite",
    ". therefore , it solves the equation @xmath20 we call this equation the ultradiscrete kp equation for the variables ( @xmath16 ; @xmath17 , @xmath19 ) .",
    "this corresponds to ( [ ukphier1 ] ) in the case where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are larger than @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively and the function depends on the form of @xmath23 and @xmath24 for independent variables @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we note that this function also solves @xmath27 by interchanging the roles of ( @xmath16 , @xmath25 ) and ( @xmath17 , @xmath19 ) .",
    "we call this equation the ultradiscrete kp equation for the variables ( @xmath28 )",
    ". we also note that if the function ( [ defkphtau ] ) solves ( [ ukphier1 ] ) , it also solves @xmath29 by combining arguments above .",
    "we call this equation the ultradiscrete kp equation for variables the ( @xmath30 ) .    before proceeding with the proof ,",
    "we introduce some lemmas .",
    "[ lem1 ] let @xmath31 for @xmath32 such that @xmath33 then , it holds that @xmath34    we omit the proof because it is the same as that of lemma 2 in @xcite .    [ lem2 ] when one requires that @xmath35 are solutions of ( [ ukphier1 ] ) and ( [ ukphier2 ] ) , one then has @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "we prove ( [ lem2 - 1 ] ) by induction . by employing @xmath38",
    ", we obtain @xmath39 adding the inequalities yields @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "the third argument is less than @xmath42 because of ( [ ukphier1 ] ) for @xmath43 .",
    "then , all arguments in the maximum are less than @xmath42 by the assumption of the induction and lemma [ lem1 ] .    the proofs of ( [ lem2 - 2 ] ) and ( [ lem2 - 3 ] ) are the same .",
    "now , let us prove theorem [ mainthm ] .",
    "we employ induction on n. it is trivial that @xmath44 solves these equations and we assume that @xmath45 satisfies ( [ ukphier1 ] ) and ( [ ukphier2 ] ) .",
    "let us prove ( [ ukphier1 ] ) first .",
    "by definition ( [ defkphtau ] ) , one has @xmath46 by virtue of lemma [ lem1 ] , the third argument of ( [ ukph1 ] ) can not yield the maximum because it is always less than the second .",
    "therefore , we can rewrite ( [ ukph1 ] ) as @xmath47 by employing the same reasoning , we obtain @xmath48    by the assumption , we have to prove that @xmath45 satisfies the equation : @xmath49    here , we consider each case for the values of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we note that in the case @xmath50 , @xmath10 should be equal to @xmath7 because of @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , we should consider six case @xmath52 or @xmath21 and @xmath53 , @xmath54 or @xmath55 . however , in the case @xmath52 and @xmath56 , ( [ ukphier1 ] ) reduces to ( [ ukpnnpm ] ) , which is already proven .",
    "therefore , it suffices to consider the remaining four cases .",
    "( i ) : :    the case @xmath57 and    @xmath58 .    in this case",
    ", @xmath45 depends on the form of @xmath59 for @xmath16 , @xmath26 , and @xmath19 .",
    "we arrange all of the shifts for the variables @xmath26 and @xmath19 to @xmath17 and omit these variables .",
    "then , ( [ mideq1 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath60 then , we should prove @xmath61 however , these inequalities are satisfied because @xmath62 is a solution of the ultradiscrete kp equation for @xmath63 .",
    "( ii ) : :    the case @xmath57 and    @xmath64 .    in this case",
    ", @xmath45 depends on @xmath24 for @xmath17 and @xmath26 .",

    "( iii ) : :    the case @xmath52 and    @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath45 depends on @xmath23 for @xmath16 , @xmath25 .",

    "( iv ) : :    the case @xmath57 and    @xmath53 .",
    "( [ mideq1 ] ) is reduced to ( [ ukphier2 ] ) for @xmath43 .",
    "let us next prove ( [ ukphier2 ] ) . by virtue of a method similar to that in the proof of ( [ ukphier1 ] ) , we should prove @xmath72 now , by employing lemma [ lem2 ] , this equation is reduced to @xmath73 similar to the proof of ( [ ukphier1 ] ) , we should consider each possible case for the parameters .",
    "the case where @xmath52 and @xmath56 is already proven in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we should prove the remaining four cases .",
    "( i ) : :    the case @xmath57 and    @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath45 depends on @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "now , by virtue of the relation @xmath76 , the equation is rewritten as @xmath77 therefore , we should prove @xmath78 this inequality is obtained by interchanging the roles of the variables between ( @xmath16 , @xmath25 ) and ( @xmath17 , @xmath19 ) in the case @xmath79 for ( [ lem2 - 2 ] ) .",
    "( ii ) : :    the remaining cases : ( [ mideq - b ] ) are reduced to ( [ ukphier1 ] ) for    @xmath43 .",
    "since the dependent variables @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath19 do not change in the recursion ( [ defkphtau ] ) in the proof in the last section , we can extend the above discussion in two ways .",
    "one way is to increase the number of independent variables . by introducing integers @xmath80 and @xmath81 satisfying @xmath82 , and variables @xmath83 and @xmath84",
    ", we define @xmath85 as @xmath86 where @xmath87 here , we omit subscripts which do not change in the equation . applying the proof to the variables ( @xmath88 ; @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) for @xmath91 , we obtain the ultradiscrete kp equation for ( @xmath88 ; @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) : @xmath92 by interchanging the roles of variables @xmath88 and @xmath89 , we also obtain the ultradiscrete kp equation for ( @xmath88 ; @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) .",
    "these equations are ultradiscrete analogues of the basic relation of the discrete kp hierarchy .",
    "the other way is by extending to non - autonomous systems .",
    "let us introduce functions @xmath93 and @xmath94 satisfying @xmath95 and @xmath96 for @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 instead of parameters @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "then , by denoting @xmath102 and @xmath103 , we can replace @xmath104 and @xmath105 with @xmath106 and @xmath107 respectively , in ( [ eta ] ) . here",
    "@xmath108 means @xmath109    combining these two generalizations yields the following theorem :    the function written as @xmath110 for @xmath4 given by @xmath111 solves the non - autonomous ultradiscrete kp hierarchy : @xmath112 where the tuple of variables ( @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 ; @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 ) is ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 ; @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath101 ) or ( @xmath89 , @xmath88 , @xmath121 ; @xmath101 , @xmath122 , @xmath119 ) for @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "in this section , we extend the start of the recursion ( [ defkphtau ] ) .",
    "first , we consider the case @xmath125 and @xmath126 for all @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 . in this case",
    ", @xmath130 depends only on functions in the form of @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "we denote this ( two variable ) function as @xmath133 , i.e , @xmath134 here , by virtue of lemma [ lem2 ] , one has @xmath135 then , @xmath133 solves the ultradiscrete kp hierarchy ( [ ukphier3 ] ) and ( [ ukphier4 ] ) becomes a trivial identity and all necessary inequalities to prove theorem [ mainthm ] are generated by the inequalities ( [ condbg0a ] ) and ( [ condbg0b ] ) . we note that we can also append a new soliton parametrized as @xmath136 and @xmath137 by the recursion ( [ defkphtau2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can choose arbitrary @xmath133 satisfying these inequalities for the start of the recursion , i.e. , we can choose a @xmath133 that satisfies @xmath138 and @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "however , it should be noted that we do not need to restrict @xmath141 and @xmath142 to @xmath143 , i.e. , we can construct solutions even if the suprema of the left hand sides of ( [ condbg1 ] ) and ( [ condbg2 ] ) are negative . this solution is called a  background \" , because all solitons evolve over it .",
    "different from soliton solutions , backgrounds can keep their structure under addition because the left hand sides of ( [ condbg1 ] ) and ( [ condbg2 ] ) are linear for @xmath133 .",
    "now , note that the solutions of the ultradiscrete kp equation in @xcite are special cases of the solution defined in ( [ defkphtau ] ) .",
    "the backgrounds are further special cases of the solutions in @xcite .",
    "it is known that the standard bbs has several degrees of freedom , for example , the capacity of balls for boxes at each site and for carriers at each time . by setting reductions properly ,",
    "we can obtain exact solutions of this system with backgrounds .",
    "we consider the case @xmath144 , @xmath145 and assume that @xmath130 depends on @xmath146 for @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 , i.e. , we consider the case where @xmath149 and @xmath150 are sufficiently large .",
    "we now introduce new independent variables @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 and new dependent variables @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "note that because of the constraints on @xmath158 , @xmath159 of section 3 , we have that @xmath160 , which means that the capacity of the carriers is greater than that of the boxes .",
    "then , the non - autonomous ultradiscrete kp equation for ( @xmath147 ; @xmath148 , @xmath161 ) and ( @xmath147 ; @xmath148 , @xmath162 ) is rewritten as @xmath163 here , we denote @xmath164 and set the boundary condition : @xmath165 for @xmath166 . due to these equations",
    ", @xmath167 equals @xmath168 .",
    "however , by virtue of the boundary condition , we also express this as @xmath169 therefore , one has @xmath170 which is the time evolution rule of the box and ball system with carrier ( bbsc ) .",
    "solutions to this equation are obtained by setting parameters @xmath171 for @xmath172 .",
    "soliton solutions for this system were first presented in @xcite and the direct relationship to the discrete case is shown in @xcite by ultradiscretizing soliton solutions of the discrete modified kdv equation .",
    "we note that we can also construct solutions of the bbsc multi - kinds of boxes and balls by properly setting different reduction conditions .    due to the specialization of parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 ,",
    "the background solution satisfying ( [ condbg1 ] ) and ( [ condbg2 ] ) is expressed as @xmath173 where @xmath174 is a function satisfying @xmath175 .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     we next observe the behavior of @xmath176 numerically by setting parameters @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 for @xmath184 , @xmath185 for @xmath186 .",
    "figure [ pic2 ] depicts @xmath176 in the range @xmath187 .",
    "two blocks of balls travel with at the same speed @xmath188 when @xmath189 .",
    "but when @xmath190 , a ball is injected the former block and passes the latter one finally .",
    "this phenomenon can be explained using the ultradiscrete miura transformation of @xcite .",
    "the dependent variables @xmath191 and @xmath176 satisfy the relationship : @xmath192    the following ultradiscrete - closed proof is originally presented in @xcite .    by subtracting left hand side from right hand side , we obtain @xmath193 here , by employing ( [ backlund1 ] ) and ( [ backlund2 ] ) , one can rewrite @xmath194 which is identically equal to @xmath195 because of @xmath160 .    due to the ultradiscrete miura transformation ( [ udmiura ] ) , the case where @xmath196 is achieved only if @xmath197 and @xmath165 .",
    "therefore , the length of a block increases at @xmath190 because of an increment of capacity of the carrier and the velocity of blocks in the bbsc ( [ bbsc ] ) .",
    "figure [ pic3 ] depicts the time evolution of @xmath191 which is obtained by ( [ udmiura ] ) from @xmath176 in figure [ pic2 ] .",
    "the contribution of @xmath198 is hidden in the degrees of freedom of solutions to ( [ ukdvnonlinear ] ) .",
    "to end this section , we stress that @xmath176 does _ not _ satisfy the ultradiscrete kdv equation known as the time evolution rule for the standard bbs : @xmath199 because this equation is obtained from by taking reductions @xmath200 ( and @xmath176 is the same ) from the ultradiscrete kp equation for ( @xmath16 ; @xmath17 , @xmath19 )",
    ". however , any @xmath176 that satisfies ( [ standardbbs ] ) also solves ( [ ukdvnonlinear ] ) , because one can represent @xmath201 in two ways .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a recursive representation of solutions to an ultradiscrete analogue of the discrete kp hierarchy and its background solutions as a starting point for the recursion .",
    "for the equation , we took two different types of independent variables @xmath88 and @xmath89 and chose one variable from one type and two variables from the other . in the proof",
    ", we employed the properties of two variables which belong to the same type .",
    "however , solutions no longer solve the equation if we choose all three variables from one type .",
    "the difference of type plays an important role in the ultradiscrete equations .    equation ( [ ukphier2 ] ) is considered to be obtained by ultradiscretizing a combination of some equations in the discrete kp hierarchy .",
    "in fact , we employ the reduction of ( [ ukphier2 ] ) as a lax form for the ultradiscrete kdv equation in section 6 .",
    "different from the discrete equations , ultradiscrete equations are not easily combined because of the @xmath0 operators . employing this reduction approach ,",
    "we can obtain variations of ultradiscrete soliton equations which have been previously been obtained from discrete equations by an ultradiscrete , closed , approach .    as discussed in section 3",
    ", we can consider that the recursion ( [ defkphtau ] ) does not depend on any other independent variables except @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in this case however , equation ( [ ukphier1 ] ) is essentially not a difference equation but just an ordinary algebraic equation .",
    "since the number of variables is greater than that of the equations , its solutions form a 1-parameter family .",
    "if this parameter satisfies a relation corresponding to ( [ ukphier2 ] ) , we can obtain new solutions by applying the recursion to these solutions .",
    "we believe that this can be explained by some elementary approach , for example , a geometrical one , which should represent the essence of the ultradiscrete soliton equations .",
    "the author would like to thanks professors t. tokihiro and r. willox for helpful comments .",
    "this work was supported by platform for dynamic approaches to living system from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology , japan ."
