    "single crystal sapphire ( @xmath3al@xmath4o@xmath5 ) is an important material used extensively in many areas of scientific research , particularly in optical , semiconductor and microwave technologies . in these fields ,",
    "one of its major roles is as the gain medium in masers@xcite and lasers@xcite , where it is intentionally doped with a high concentration of paramagnetic impurity ions .",
    "the high concentration case has been well studied , however the role of extremely dilute , naturally occurring impurity ions contained in ultra - high purity sapphire is less well known .",
    "such unavoidable paramagnetic impurity ions exist at a concentration of parts per billion to parts per million and have been particularly useful in a number of precision microwave experiments@xcite , allowing cryogenic sapphire oscillator technology to operate at its highest stability , and more recently facilitating the discovery of a number of nonlinear effects@xcite .    besides application to ultra - stable frequency sources , such systems are also eminently applicable in the framework of quantum measurement , control and computation . naturally occurring impurities in ` pure ' crystal resonators could lead to the realisation of microwave cavity qed ( quantum electrodynamics ) experiments in the strong coupling regime@xcite with unprecedented coherence times . for comparison , current technology in the realm of qubit devices consists mainly of on - chip superconducting transmission line cavities with state - of - the - art coherence times on the order of several tens of microseconds .",
    "recently , hybrid quantum systems have been proposed that involve coupling of solid state qubits , crystals intentionally doped with rare - earth ions , to microwave cavity modes in macroscopic classical resonators@xcite .",
    "such systems achieve spin and mode coherence times of the order of seconds and microseconds respectively .",
    "the latter can be improved by using an ultra - pure single crystal sapphire operating in a whispering gallery ( wg ) mode of resonance , offering coherence times on the order of 50 ms for a typical mode with @xmath6 ghz and @xmath7 . despite a very low concentration of impurities ,",
    "the ion - cavity photon interaction is clearly resolvable due to the extremely high quality factor of the wg modes .",
    "indeed , strong interactions between microwave photons and impurity spins in cavities based on ` pure ' crystals do not lead to an increase in microwave losses due to artificial doping .",
    "in addition , such media could be used to create a quantum interface between microwave quantum processing devices and optical communication links by using coupling between microwave and optical transitions in impurity ions .",
    "all of these challenging goals require a better understanding of ion energy level transitions , and ion - photon interaction in extremely low loss , ultra - pure systems .",
    "unlike other spectroscopic studies of doped sapphire crystals , here we use an ultra - sensitive approach to detect and analyse naturally occurring , extremely low concentration ion impurities .",
    "some preliminary observations of interactions with fe@xmath0 ions in such crystals have been made in the past@xcite .",
    "broadly speaking , the present work represents a systematic study of ion - photon interactions over the x and k@xmath8 band of microwave frequencies ( 8 - 20 ghz ) .",
    "such a complete spectroscopic study in this region is useful for all applications of sapphire in the microwave domain .",
    "in this work , we cool large cylindrical sapphire resonators close to 100 mk and use a novel technique exploiting extremely high @xmath9-factor whispering gallery modes as a sensitive probe of electron spin resonance frequencies under the influence of an external magnetic field . by sweeping an applied magnetic field and identifying avoided crossings between photonic whispering gallery modes and electron spin resonances ( esr ) of paramagnetic ions ,",
    "we observe the classically forbidden quadrupole transition of fe@xmath0 in sapphire , and describe the interaction of the inhomogeneously broadened fe@xmath0 esr with a number of paramagnetic spin species in the crystal .",
    "sapphire crystals have been measured using this technique previously @xcite , however these measurements were of low sensitivity . in the present work ,",
    "we refine the technique and present spectroscopic measurements at higher sensitivity than previously achieved .",
    "one factor in particular which led to the poor sensitivity in previous experiments was the absence of the usual copper cavity in which sapphire wg mode resonators are typically mounted to contain the stray field and ensure the highest @xmath9-factor .",
    "the bore size of the superconducting magnet was too narrow to allow a cavity to enclose the crystal , which resulted in lowered wg mode @xmath9-factors and thus lower sensitivity to weaker interactions .",
    "in addition , previous measurements were performed with a non - programmable magnet controller and thus the throughput and resolution of data was limited by having to continuously manually set the target field of the magnet . finally , previous measurements focused on fields and frequencies predicted by the fe@xmath0 hamiltonian , and thus interactions in regions away from this specific fe@xmath0 interaction were ignored .",
    "all these improvements lead to more systematic study of dilute impurities and their interaction with the field .      to characterize the various species of paramagnetic ions in sapphire ,",
    "it is possible to record the frequency and magnetic field response of a range of wg modes supported in the resonator . as a dc magnetic field",
    "is applied parallel to the @xmath10-axis of the crystal and swept in magnitude , the sapphire cavity transmission coefficient @xmath11 is measured for a spectrum of wg modes .",
    "the modes , with @xmath9-factors commonly in the range of @xmath12 in sapphire , act as extremely narrow band pass filters sharply defined in frequency when far - detuned from an esr transition .",
    "when the esr is tuned close to the wg mode resonance by the dc external magnetic field , the @xmath11 trace shows a shift in the wg mode frequency and a degradation of its q factor .",
    "fits were made to the @xmath11 data to find the lowest value of amplitude , corresponding to the field at which the esr transition is tuned on resonance with the wg mode .",
    "the modes were measured with an applied external dc magnetic field with a strength up to 0.9  t. whispering gallery modes act as extremely sensitive probes of the presence of impurity spins due to considerable photon - spin interaction .",
    "the strength of this interaction depends on the mode polarisation ( wgh , wge or hybrid ) , mode volume , mode quality factor and ion concentration .",
    "generally higher quality factors are preferable because they increase photon - spin interaction probability as photon lifetime in the cavity increases . by measuring a spectrum of wg modes across a broad frequency range ,",
    "it is then possible to determine energy levels of corresponding impurity ions , lande @xmath13-factors , photon - spin coupling , impurity concentration , esr linewidths , etc .",
    "the crystal under study was a highest - purity sapphire from gt crystal systems ( usa ) grown using the heat exchange method ( hemex ) and machined into a cylinder 50 mm diameter @xmath14 30 mm height .",
    "the concentration of fe@xmath0 impurity ions in the crystal has been measured previously to be approximately 100 parts per billion@xcite .",
    "such a concentration was achieved through an annealing process in air which caused mass conversion of fe@xmath1 to fe@xmath0 .",
    "the crystal is cut such that the @xmath10-axis of the crystal structure is oriented is parallel to the cylindrical @xmath15-axis of the resonator . to attain the highest quality factor whispering gallery modes at low temperature ,",
    "the crystal is mounted in a cavity manufactured from oxygen - free high thermal conductivity copper to avoid hot - spots at oxygen impurities .",
    "energy is coupled to the crystal through two straight antennae orientated 180@xmath16 from each other , entering through the top of the cavity and parallel to the @xmath15 axis of the crystal .",
    "the crystal was cooled using a cryogen - free dilution refrigerator ( dr ) , with a cooling power of 1.5 w at the second pulse tube stage ( 4 k ) , and @xmath17500 @xmath18w at 100 mk ( see fig .  [ ea2 ] ) .",
    "a superconducting magnet was attached to the 4 k stage of the dr , with the crystal mounted within a 1  k radiation shield which sits within the bore of the magnet .",
    "due to the small diameter of the magnet bore , the distance between the outer wall of the cavity and the inner wall of the 1  k shield inside the bore is approximatley 3  mm , permitting weak thermalization between the 1k  shield and the crystal .",
    "although the crystal is attached to the mixing chamber plate of the fridge ( @xmath1720 mk ) , after thermalization the crystal reaches an equilibrium temperature of @xmath17115  mk .",
    "the corresponding temperature sensor is directly attached to a copper block holding the crystal .",
    "a number of wg modes were measured in the resonator using a vector network analyzer at an excitation power between -90 and -30  dbm incident on the input probe antenna . at higher powers",
    ", the temperature of the crystal increases and nonlinear behaviour begins to occur in the crystal .",
    "the network analyzer in these measurements had an upper frequency limit of 20  ghz .",
    "the cables inside the dr were connected to each stage via a feedthrough and dc block to allow thermalization of both the inner and outer conductor , and to reduce temperature gradients in the system . in addition , 10  db attenuators were included in the line at the 4  k stage and 1  k stage of the dr , and a 20  db attenuator was attached at the mixing chamber stage .",
    "cold attenuation ensures a sufficiently low power signal is incident on the crystal without the addition of thermal noise from room temperature attenuation .",
    "the signal transmitted through the wg cavity passes through a low noise cryogenic amplifier ( @xmath19k stage ) separated from the cavity by an isolator ( @xmath20mk stage ) preventing the back action noise .",
    "another amplification cascade is used at the room temperature to ensure a better signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "matlab software was developed to automatically control the field strength of the magnet , and the sweep parameters and data acquisition of the network analyzer .",
    "the sweep rate of the magnetic field was set slowly enough that temperature of the copper cavity enclosing the sapphire was not significantly changed by induced eddy currents .",
    "a ramping rate of @xmath21  t / min was found to successfully ensure that all measurements were made at thermal equilibrium .",
    "a schematic of the experimental apparatus is shown in fig .",
    "the frequency stability of the measurement system is maintained by a hydrogen maser to avoid all long term fluctuations during the experiment .",
    "the most naturally abundant isotope of iron is @xmath22fe , with a nuclear spin @xmath23 .",
