    "due to the explosive growth in wireless data services , mainly driven by video communications , next - generation wireless systems will require significant advances @xcite in terms of data - rate , latency , and energy consumptions , as well as improved networking and resource allocation procedures .",
    "moreover , according to the emerging `` internet of things '' ( iot ) paradigm and the diffusion of machine - to - machine communications , next - generation wireless systems must be able to support an enormous number of low - rate devices , which will require new approaches and policies for spectrum allocation and management , including new forms of _ spectrum sharing _",
    ", where _ cognitive radio _",
    "( cr ) approaches @xcite are expected to play a major role . in cr techniques , secondary users ( sus )",
    "share a portion of the spectrum with licensed or unlicensed primary users ( pus ) .",
    "such an approach is beneficial , e.g. , for ultradense wireless systems @xcite , where medium - to - low - rate su terminals might share the spectrum with high - rate pu devices .",
    "the cognitive radio approach stems from the fact that a major part of the licensed and unlicensed spectrum is typically unused for significant periods of time , so called _ spectrum holes _ or _",
    "white spaces_. therefore , a simple opportunistic access paradigm consists of allowing the sus to transmit in an orthogonal fashion ( space , time or frequency ) relative to the pu signals , which will be referred to as _ orthogonal cr ( ocr)_. @xcite . such an approach requires a possible multidimensional space - time - frequency detection of pu users , called _ spectrum sensing _ @xcite . however , accurate detection of a vacant spectrum is not an easy task @xcite . moreover ,",
    "next - generation wireless systems mandate non - orthogonal primary and secondary transmissions @xcite , which will be referred to as _ non - orthogonal cr ( nocr)_.    there are two different visions in cr to accomplish spectrum sharing on a non - orthogonal basis @xcite : ( i ) sus can share pu communications resources , provided that they keep the interference to pu transmissions ( so called _ interference temperature _ @xcite ) below a very low threshold ; ( ii ) sophisticated encoding and decoding techniques are used to remove all ( or part of ) the mutual interference between pu and su transmissions @xcite , in order to relax the threshold on the su transmission powers . in the former paradigm , one of the major problem is to determine the interference level a secondary transmitter causes to a primary receiver ; in the latter one , sophisticated encoding techniques like dirty paper coding ( dpc ) @xcite require _ a priori _ knowledge of the primary user s transmitted data and/or how this sequence is encoded ( codebook ) .",
    "the underlying common feature of both approaches is the _ additive superposition _ of pu and su transmissions ( additive interference channel @xcite ) , i.e , pu and su signals add up .",
    "recently , we have proposed in @xcite a different nocr paradigm where the arithmetic operation of multiplication is used to superimpose a single su symbol on a primary signal composed of multiple pu symbols , through a single - channel amplify - and - forward ( af ) protocol .",
    "the main advantages of such a scheme can be summarized as follows : ( i ) under non - restrictive conditions @xcite , the su can transmit without a power constraint , while keeping the desirable property of not degrading ( but even improving ) the pu performance ; ( ii ) _ a priori _ knowledge of the pu data at the su is not required .",
    "however , the main limitation of the single - channel approach in @xcite is that only low - data rates can be achieved by the su .",
    "the aim of this paper is to improve the achievable data rates of the su by introducing the concept of _ convolutive superposition _ ,",
    "whereby the su data are superimposed on the pu received signal by means of a time - domain convolution .",
    "such a new code construction extends the multiplicative superposition scheme of @xcite along three lines :    1 .   we consider a cr system where modulation is based on _ orthogonal frequency - division multiplexing ( ofdm ) _",
    "@xcite , due to its advantages in multipath resistance , performance , spectral efficiency , flexibility , and computational complexity .",
    "the multicarrier nature of the pu transmission allows the su to be active over multiple primary subchannels , thereby attaining larger transmission rates compared to the single - channel scheme considered in @xcite .",
    "2 .   for each pu subchannel",
    ", we allow the su to transmit multiple symbols within a single ofdm symbol interval of the primary system , by jointly exploiting both white spaces ( i.e. , unused subcarriers of the pu signal ) and dirty spaces ( i.e. , subcarriers used by the pu ) .",
    "the multi - channel multi - symbol nature of the secondary transmission introduces additional degrees of freedom with respect to the single - channel approach of @xcite : the distribution of the available power over the transmit dimensions . in this regard ,",
    "we develop _ precoding _ strategies for the su transmission by considering either the case when channel state information ( csi ) is available at the secondary transmitter or this knowledge is missing .    the theoretical performance analysis of the proposed scheme is based on input - output mutual information and ergodic capacity of both the primary and secondary systems .",
    "results of comparisons studies with other cr approaches are also reported in terms of ergodic capacity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . the system model and the considered communication scheme",
    "are described in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "the capacity analysis for the pu is carried out in section  [ sec : analysis - pu ] .",
    "the information - theoretic analysis and precoding designs for the su are developed in section  [ sec : analysis - su ] , by considering different amounts of csi at both ends of the communication link .",
    "numerical results are reported in section  [ sec : simul ] , aimed at corroborating our theoretical findings .",
    "finally , the main results obtained in the paper are summarized in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "we consider a multicarrier cognitive network ( see fig .  [ fig : figure_1 ] ) composed by a primary transmitter - receiver pair ( nodes ptx and prx ) and one secondary transmitter - receiver pair ( nodes stx and srx ) .",
    "the nodes have a single antenna and operate in half - duplex mode , except for the stx which is equipped with two antennas ( one receive antenna and one transmit antenna ) that enable a full - duplex operation .",
    "the pu employs ofdm modulation with @xmath0 subcarriers , a cyclic prefix ( cp ) of length @xmath1 , and symbol period @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denotes the sampling period of the pu system .",
    "only @xmath5 out of the @xmath0 available subcarriers are utilized , whereas the remaining @xmath6 ones are unmodulated and called _ virtual subcarriers ( vcs)_. the stx exploits the pu transmission to deliver to the srx its own data , by simultaneously transmitting over the same subcarriers of the pu , as described in subsection  [ sec : stx - trans ] .",
    "it is assumed that the su perfectly knows the allocation of the vcs within the pu frequency range .      during an interval of duration @xmath7",
    ", the wireless channel between the pair of nodes @xmath8 , for @xmath9 and @xmath10 , is modeled as a causal linear time - invariant ( lti ) system spanning at the most @xmath11 sampling interval of the pu , i.e. , its discrete - time impulse response obeys @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "such an impulse response is fixed during the transmission of one ofdm symbol , but is allowed to independently change from one symbol to another . in the sequel , we will denote with @xmath14 the integer time offset ( to ) characterizing the @xmath15 link ( encompassing both the propagation delay of the wireless link and the processing time at node @xmath16 ) , which models the fact that the receiver @xmath17 does not know where the multicarrier blocks transmitted by node @xmath16 start .. ] we will assume that , for each @xmath15 link , the sum of the channel order and the to turns out to be within one pu symbol , i.e. , @xmath18 , such that the desired block received by node @xmath17 is impaired only by the interblock interference ( ibi ) of the previous block .",

    "additionally , as a performance comparison , we report the exact ergodic capacity @xmath287 of the ocr scheme , referred to as `` conventional ocr '' , when the su transmits only on the vcs of the pu , i.e. , @xmath467 in ; we also plot the worst - case capacity of the norc scheme @xcite when no csi is available , referred to as `` nocr @xcite '' , which is obtained from by setting @xmath468 , @xmath250 , and @xmath469^{\\text{t}}\\in { \\mathbb{r}}^m$ ] , where @xmath470 is given by with @xmath471 .            figs .",
    "[ fig : fig_6 ] and [ fig : fig_8 ] depict the capacity performance as a function of @xmath472 for different values of the ratio @xmath456 , with @xmath457 .",
    "results show that , regardless of the availability of csi at the stx , the performance of the proposed schemes ( with and without vcs ) rapidly improves when the stx is moving away from the ptx and , at the same time , it is approaching the srx .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that , when the distance @xmath436 between the ptx and the stx tends to be smaller than the distance @xmath473 between the stx and the srx , the signal - to - interference ratio at the srx increases .",
    "the conventional ocr scheme is able to compete with the proposed scheme with vcs only when the interference generated by the pu transmission over the @xmath474 link dominates the su signal , i.e. , the stx is too close to the ptx and , at the same time , too far from the srx .",
    "in particular , when @xmath475 , the conventional ocr scheme slightly outperforms the proposed scheme with vcs if there is no csi at the stx ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_8 ] ) .",
    "the motivation is that the uniform power allocation is suboptimal ( in the information - theoretic sense ) for the su when many subchannels are heavily contaminated by the pu interference .",
    "this problem is circumvented if csi is available at the stx and , hence , power can be optimally allocated on the subcarriers ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_6 ] ) . underneath all of this , it is noteworthy that the ocr scheme necessarily requires the presence of vcs ( i.e. , spectrum holes ) in the pu signal , whose presence might be difficult to reliably detect in practice .",
    "in contrast , our scheme can achieve satisfactory data rates even without exploiting the ( possible ) presence of vcs , especially when the stx is sufficiently close to the srx .",
    "in particular , when @xmath476 , the proposed scheme without vcs ensure a significant increase in data rate with respect to the nocr scheme proposed in @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig_8 ] ) , which not only is unable to exploit the presence of the vcs , but also assumes the transmission of one su symbol per pu data block , i.e , @xmath308 , and does not carry out the precoding of the su data .    figs .",
    "[ fig : fig_7 ] and [ fig : fig_9 ] report the capacity performance as a function of @xmath477 for different values of the power ratio @xmath458 , with @xmath478 .",
    "overall , it is evident that , compared to the other considered schemes , the performance advantage offered by the proposed scheme ( with and without vcs ) becomes more and more marked when @xmath458 increases .",
    "we remember that an increase in the power ratio @xmath458 is also beneficial for the pu system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_4 ] ) .",
    "for example , with reference to a primary wi - fi system with @xmath460 mhz , when @xmath461 , @xmath478 , and @xmath479 db , it results from figs .",
    "[ fig : fig_6 ] and [ fig : fig_8 ] that the su capacity of the proposed scheme with vcs is at least equal to @xmath480 mbps with csit and @xmath481 mbps with no csit , whereas , when @xmath365 is twice @xmath70 , these gains go up at least to @xmath482 mbps and @xmath483 mbps ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : fig_7 ] and [ fig : fig_9 ] ) , respectively .",
    "we proposed a spectrum sharing scheme which allows the su to concurrently transmit within the overall bandwidth of the pu system , by generalizing and subsuming as a particular case existing ocr and nocr approaches .",
    "contrary to the classical nocr paradigm , a key feature of the proposed scheme is that the concurrent su transmission improves ( rather than degrades ) the performance of the pu system , under reasonable conditions .",
    "another remarkable result is that , if the su is willing to spend extra transmit power , it can obtain a multicarrier link with a significant data rate .",
    "such a performance might be further improved by assuming that the stx has perfect knowledge of the relevant channel parameters , which allows one to use the waterfilling solution for precoding its information - bearing data .",
    "since @xmath333 in is a strictly increasing function of @xmath365 , @xmath366 .",
