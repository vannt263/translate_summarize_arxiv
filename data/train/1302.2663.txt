    "recent years have seen significant progress in the characterisation of star formation and feedback in high redshift galaxies .",
    "while much of these strides have stemmed from spectroscopic study of large samples of @xmath10 galaxies ( e.g. , shapley 2011 for a recent review ) , strong gravitational lensing is now playing an increasingly important role .",
    "as typical galaxies are often too faint and too small to study individually in great detail , the magnification provided by strong gravitational lensing ( often 10 - 30@xmath8 ) provides one of our only means of dissecting high redshift galaxies in great detail with current facilities .",
    "study of strongly - lensed gravitationally lensed galaxies helps high - redshift studies in two ways .",
    "first the flux amplification enables spectra of higher resolution and increased signal to noise , yielding unique constraints on the absorbing gas ( pettini et al .",
    "2002 , quider et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 , dessauge - zavadsky et al . 2010 ) and detailed emission line studies of the ionised gas ( e.g. , fosbury et al .",
    "2003 , yuan et al .",
    "2009 , hainline et al .",
    "2009 , bian et al .",

    "2011 , richard et al .",
    "2011 , wuyts et al .",
    "2012 , brammer et al .",
    "second , the increase in the apparent size of the lensed sources enables characterisation of the internal kinematics and metallicity gradients on scales as small as 100 parsec ( e.g. , stark et al .",
    "2008 , swinbank et al .",
    "2009 , jones et al .",
    "2010a , 2010b , 2012b ) .",
    "a tremendous amount of physical information becomes accessible through analysis of the optical spectra of the brightest lensed galaxies .",
    "the wide array of interstellar absorption features that are detectable in the rest - frame uv of bright lensed galaxies enable abundances to be measured for numerous chemical elements . in a detailed study of ms 1512-cb58 , one of the highest surface brightness",
    "lensed galaxies , pettini et al .",
    "( 2002 ) demonstrated that while the ism is already heavily enriched with elements released in type ii supernovae , those elements ( n and fe - peak ) produced on longer timescales ( via intermediate mass stars and type ia supernovae ) are significantly underabundant .",
    "these results provide a unique measure of the past star formation history , indicative of a picture whereby the bulk of metal enrichment has occurred in the past @xmath11 myr . whether these abundance patterns vary with redshift , galaxy mass , or star formation rate remains unclear owing to the small sample of galaxies bright enough for such detailed analysis .",
    "the absorption line measurements of ultra - bright lensed galaxies additionally provide our most complete picture of the kinematics and geometry of the interstellar gas . in the handful of lensed systems with detailed measurements ,",
    "absorption is seen over a velocity range of 1000 km s@xmath12 with respect to the stars .",
    "as expected , the bulk of the interstellar material in these systems is outflowing from the stars with typical speeds of 100 - 300 km s@xmath12 . in the case of ms 1512-cb58 , the rate at which mass is ejected in the outflow is shown to be comparable if not greater than rate at which gas is converted to stars ( pettini et al . 2000 , 2002 ) , consistent with recent inferences from the detection of a broadened component of h@xmath13 emission lines in unlensed @xmath1 galaxies from the sins survey ( genzel et al",
    ". 2011 , newman et al .",
    "further constraints on the outflow mass loading factor are of crucial importance to an understanding of how outflows regulate star formation and the chemical evolution of high redshift galaxies .",
    "with the development of adaptive - optics assisted infrared integral field spectrographs on 8 - 10 m telescopes , similarly unique insights are being achieved through measurement of the distribution of resolved properties within lensed galaxies at @xmath14 .",
    "most recently , resolved metallicity gradient measurements have been presented for five bright lensed galaxies ( jones et al .",
    "2010b , 2012b ; yuan et al .",
    "2011 ) with source plane resolution as fine as 300 pc .",
    "the current data point toward 2 - 3@xmath8 steeper metallicity gradients at higher redshift , as expected in realistic models of inside - out growth ( see jones et al .",
    "2012b ) ; yet with the small existing samples of lensed galaxies with resolved metallicity measurements , significant uncertainties in the average gradient evolution remain .    clearly the potential impact of lensing studies has been stunted by the small number of the brightest systems for which detailed analysis is possible . with only a handful of galaxies having absorption line measurements with adequate s / n and resolution , it is difficult to assess population averages of the mass loading factor and ism chemical abundance patterns .",
    "near - ir studies are more severely compromised , as many of the brightest systems happen to be located at redshifts which place their strong rest - optical emission lines behind sky lines .",
    "larger samples of bright @xmath14 gravitationally - lensed galaxies are required to build upon the emerging framework .",
    "fortunately , through a variety of imaging surveys ranging from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) to hst surveys of galaxy clusters ( e.g. , ebeling et al .",
    "2010 ) , the number of bright lensed galaxies has rapidly increased in recent years .",
    "our group is one of several ( see also e.g. , hennawi et al .",
    "2008 ; diehl et al . 2009 ; kiester et al . 2010 ; kubo et al . 2011 ; bayliss et al .",
    "2011a , 2011b ; bayliss 2012 ) that has actively exploited sdss imaging for the purposes of locating galaxy galaxy lenses . as part of the cambridge and sloan survey of wide arcs in thesky ; cassowary ) , we have developed a search algorithm which targets multiple blue companions ( or arcs ) separated by @xmath15 arcseconds from luminous red galaxies ( belokurov et al .",
    "the initial search ( belokurov et al . 2007 ) yielded discovery of sdss j1148 + 1930 ( the `` cosmic horseshoe '' ) , a highly - magnified @xmath16 galaxy bright enough ( r=19.5 ) for high resolution optical spectroscopy ( quider et al .",
    "2009 ) and emission line mapping ( jones et al .",
    "2012b ) , while subsequent exploration has yielded further candidates ( e.g. , belokurov et al .",
    "2009 ; pettini et al .",
    "2010 ; christensen et al .",
    "2010 ; brewer et al .",
    "typically the cassowary systems correspond to lensing of @xmath17 star - forming galaxies by an early type galaxy and fainter group companions at @xmath18 - 0.7 .    yet in spite of this progress , there still remains nearly 50 bright candidate lensed systems in our photometric catalog ( as well as catalogs of other teams , see wen et al .",
    "2011 ) without confirmed redshifts . among those lacking confirmation",
    "are potentially some of the brightest gravitationally - lensed galaxies on the sky . to help build a more complete redshift database of the optically - brightest lensed galaxies in the sdss footprint ,",
    "we have undertaken a spectroscopic campaign ( primarily with mmt , but also using keck , magellan , and lbt ) to obtain redshifts for bright lensed candidates in our cassowary catalog . through these efforts ,",
    "we present spectroscopic redshifts for 25 lensed cassowary sources at @xmath19 detected within sdss . as much of our focus is on the spatially - resolved and high spectral resolution study of high redshift galaxies ( e.g. , stark et al .",
    "2008 ; quider et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ; jones et al .",
    "2010a , 2010b , 2012b ) , we put significant effort into confirming those targets which are optimal for this study .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy of the new cassowary sample is under way and will be described in future papers .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in  2 , we review the lens search algorithm and describe the observations undertaken for this program . in  3 , we present the new redshift sample , providing a brief discussion of the spectroscopic properties of each new system . in  4 ,",
    "we describe preliminary lens models for select systems and comment on the typical star formation rates and stellar masses of the new cassowary sample . in  5 , we provide a more extended discussion of two lensed systems and describe some of the opportunities that will be made possible with the new sample .    throughout the paper , we adopt a @xmath20-dominated , flat universe with @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . all magnitudes in this paper are quoted in the ab system ( oke et al .",
    "we began a spectroscopic campaign of cassowary candidate lensed galaxies in september of 2011 .",
    "below we review our sdss lens search algorithm and then provide details of the instrumentation used on each of these facilities .",
    "an overview of the observations is provided in table 1 .      the cassowary survey ( belokurov et al . 2007 , 2009 ) is designed to find gravitational lenses with angular einstein diameters in excess of the size of the sdss fibre ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the motivation of the survey and the search procedure is described in detail in belokurov et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . here",
    "we provide a short summary .",
    "our lens search algorithm relies primarily on the sdss photometric catalogues , rather than the actual images .",
    "the basic idea is to find massive elliptical galaxies surrounded by smaller objects with the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) suggestive of star - forming galaxies at @xmath24 .",
    "the algorithm first identifies `` seed '' lenses by selecting massive luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) which we inspect for evidence of lensing .",
    "the lrg selection uses a modified version of the criteria presented in eistenstein et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , allowing for slightly lower surface brightness , fainter apparent magnitude and slightly bluer colours .",
    "the sdss photometric quality flags are used to cull the artefacts produced by severe blending and saturated stars .    in the second step , using the sdss neighbours list for each of our `` seed lenses '' , we identified systems with more than 1 blue neighbour within 10 - 20of the lens candidate .",
    "the exact criteria of how blue the arc candidates ought to be were tuned for different iterations of the search , but typically we require at least @xmath25 or @xmath26 where `` s '' refers to the blue lensed source candidate and",
    "`` l '' corresponds to the red lens candidate .",
    "the final step is to filter out false positives .",
    "there are several astrophysical phenomena other than strong gravitational lensing that could pass the first two filters .",
    "these include nearby spiral galaxies with prominent bulges , polar rings , and various configurations of minor mergers .",
    "we take advantage of the existing sdss spectroscopy to filter out the majority of the nearby spirals .",
    "the polar rings and the mergers are picked out by visual inspection of the sdss image cutouts .",
    "the final result of this procedure is a sample of @xmath27 cassowary gravitational lens candidates .",
    "we use this as the input catalog for our spectroscopic search described below .",
    "spectroscopic observations with mmt were conducted in longslit mode primarily with the blue channel spectrograph .",
    "we used the 300 line grating of the blue channel spectrograph , providing close to 5300    of spectral coverage .",
    "we typically used a central wavelength of 5500    with a uv-36 order blocking filter .",
    "we adopted a 1 arcsec slit width , providing a spectral resolution of 6.5   .",
    "observations with the blue channel spectrograph are optimal for confirming @xmath28 galaxies via detection of uv absorption lines .    in the redshift range @xmath29 , it is far easier to confirm star - forming lensed galaxies through detection of [ oii ] emission in the red .",
    "we have thus also conducted observations with the mmt red channel spectrograph .",
    "we used the 270 line / mm grating with a central wavelength in the range @xmath30   .",
    "as with our blue channel observations , we use a slit width of 1 arcsec , providing a spectral resolution of @xmath31   .",
    "the spectral coverage with this setting is 3705   , allowing detection of emission lines out to @xmath32   , depending on the central wavelength . during our red channel runs ,",
    "we occasionally targeted candidate @xmath1 lensed galaxies . in order to search for absorption from si ii @xmath331526 , civ @xmath331549 , and al ii @xmath331671 in these @xmath1 sources , we used the 300 line / mm grating ( with central wavelength of 5500   ) , providing useful coverage in the range 4230 - 7000   .",
    "exposure times varied from candidate to candidate depending on source brightness and conditions .",
    "we generally observed an individual galaxy for between 30 and 60 minutes .",
    "specifics for each source are provided in table 1 .",
    "the conditions were typically clear but not always photometric .",
    "seeing ranged from 05 - 15 , but for most successful observations , the average seeing was @xmath34 .",
    "reduction of blue and red channel longslit spectra were conducted using standard routines .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed with hear / th arcs .",
    "each spectrum was flux calibrated using spectral observations of standard stars .",
    "we obtained near - infrared spectra for several of the cassowary systems using the folded - port infrared echellette ( fire ; simcoe et al .",
    "2010 ) on the 6.5 meter magellan baade telescope .",
    "we used fire in echelle mode , delivering continuous spectral coverage between the z - band and k - band .",
    "the slit length of fire is 7 arcseconds .",
    "we adopted a slit width of 0.75 arc seconds , providing a resolving power of @xmath35 .",
    "the fire data were reduced using the custom firehose pipeline .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed using oh sky lines .",
    "we have thus far secured emission lines for four of the galaxies in the sample presented in this paper .",
    "details are listed in table 1 and 2 .",
    "we used the deimos spectrograph ( faber et al .",
    "2003 ) on the keck ii telescope to confirm redshifts of several of our cassowary candidates .",
    "these observations were typically conducted during runs focused on deep observations of @xmath36 galaxies . when conditions were not sufficient for such deep observations , we observed bright cassowary targets .",
    "we used the 1200 line / mm grating which has a spectral resolution of @xmath37   .",
    "these observations were focused in the red , providing spectral coverage of 2630    in the wavelength range of 7000 to 10000   .",
    "reduction was conducted using the standard spec2d deimos pipeline . in total , we confirmed the redshifts of four lensed galaxies with deimos .",

    "the sample presented in this paper will provide a major stimulus to efforts to use lensed galaxies as detailed probes of galaxy formation at high redshift .",
    "detailed optical and near - infrared follow - up of this new population is now underway and will be discussed in future papers . in the following we provide an initial exploitation of the sample using the existing data .",
    "most of the optically - bright lensed @xmath14 galaxies that have been studied in detail are broadly similar in their properties to typical systems within the population of uv - continuum selected galaxies ( e.g. , shapley 2011 and references therein ) . but as the sample of bright lensed galaxies increases , we expect to find outliers that offer unique insight into galaxy formation at high redshift .",
    "the @xmath5 arc in sdss j0846 + 9446 appears to be such a source .",
    "while this is by no means the brightest continuum source in our sample , the ews of the balmer lines are much larger than are typically seen in uv - selected galaxies ( see figure 3 ) , allowing us to detect h@xmath13 through h12 with the short 20 min integration detailed in table 1 .",
    "the flux ratio of h@xmath13 and h@xmath38 ( 2.79 ) suggest that the nebular gas is largely unattenuated by dust , while the rest - frame ew of h@xmath13 emission ( @xmath39  ) points to ionising radiation from a reasonably young ( @xmath40 myr for constant star formation history using nebular emission models described in robertson et al .",
    "2010 ) stellar population .",
    "the detection of [ oiii ] @xmath334363 ( figure 3 ) enables a measurement of the electron temperature ( t@xmath4110@xmath42 k ) which can be used along with the measured line ratios of the oxygen lines ( following izotov et al .",
    "2006 ) to compute the oxygen abundance of the gas .",
    "not surprisingly given the young age and lack of dust , sdss j0846 + 9446 appears to be one of the more metal poor galaxies known at high redshift with 12+log(o / h)@xmath43 ( @xmath44 z@xmath45 ) .",
    "the lower limit we place on the [ oiii ] @xmath335007 rest - frame ew ( @xmath46320   ) is in the range spanned by the population of extreme line emitting galaxies ( eelgs ) identified in imaging and grism surveys ( e.g. , kakazu et al .",
    "2007 ; hu et al . 2009 ; atek et al . 2010 ; van der wel et al . 2012 ) .",
    "the number density of eelgs at @xmath47 is large enough to indicate that they are likely an important mode of star formation among low mass galaxies at high redshift and may well represent the manner in which the stellar mass in dwarf galaxies is assembled ( e.g. , van der wel et .",
    "yet as a result of their faint continuum flux densities , our understanding of the detailed properties of extreme line emitters at @xmath48 remains limited ( see hu et al .",
    "2009 for a detailed discussion at @xmath49 ) .    by finding a highly - magnified example of such a system",
    ", we can begin to study this population in far more detail than would be possible in unlensed examples at @xmath50 . with the spectra we have acquired to date for sdss j0846 + 9446",
    ", we will be able to explore the relative chemical abundances in the ionised gas and to characterise the properties of the outflowing gas and stellar populations .",
    "such an in depth analysis is beyond the scope of the present catalog paper and will appear in a separate work .",
    "the rest - uv absorption line spectra presented in figure 2 provide information on the kinematics and chemical content of outflowing gas in galaxies at high redshift but do not reveal the exact location of the gas along the line of sight . without knowledge of the spatial extent of the outflowing material , it is virtually impossible to characterise the energetics associated with the outflows .",
    "spectra of bright background galaxies or quasars near the line of sight of a given galaxy provide a means of overcoming this shortcoming .",
    "steidel et al .",
    "( 2010 ) conducted a comprehensive analysis of composite spectra of galaxy pairs , providing constraints on the distribution and covering fraction of circumgalactic gas on physical scales spanning 3 - 125 kpc .",
    "the stacked spectra revealed metal line absorption at distances of @xmath52 kpc and ly@xmath13 absorption from neutral hydrogen on physical scales in excess of 100 kpc .",
    "a logical goal for the future is to extend constants on the spatial extent of outflows to individual systems .",
    "most unlensed galaxy pairs are much too faint for useful constraints on the spatial extent of outflows .",
    "steidel et al .",
    "( 2010 ) present a case study for one of the brightest pairs in their sample , revealing civ and al ii absorbing gas at an impact parameter of 16 kpc from a @xmath53 galaxy .",
    "the continuum magnitudes of this particularly pair ( @xmath54=23.5 and 23.7 ) are @xmath55 magnitude brighter than typical galaxies in their sample , making this a unique measurement at @xmath1 .",
    "lensing clusters offer a feasible way of constraining the spatial distribution of circumgalactic gas on a source by source basis .",
    "the cluster environment offers two advantages .",
    "first the surface density of background sources is enhanced , providing more probes of the spatial distribution of gas associated with any individual lensed galaxy .",
    "second , the flux magnification provided to lensed systems enables much higher s / n ( and higher resolution ) spectra to be obtained . with constraints from multiple impact parameters per galaxy ( at various position angles )",
    ", it should be possible to characterise the spatial and angular distribution of circumgalactic gas associated with an individual lensed galaxy .",
    "but with these advantages also comes difficulty , as knowledge of the impact parameters of the lensed background galaxies can only be obtained with a reliable cluster mass model , limiting analysis to well - constrained lenses .    the close proximity of a bright ( @xmath56 as measured in deeper imaging presented in dahle et al .",
    "2012 ) lensed @xmath57 galaxy to three bright images of a lensed @xmath58 quasar in sdss j2222 + 2745 ( figure 4 ) enables immediate constraints on the circumgalactic gas associated with the foreground @xmath57 galaxy .",
    "the brightest quasar images are separated by 14 , 15 , and 16 arc seconds with respect to the galaxy .",
    "but the relevant quantity for calculating the impact parameter is of course the separation in the source plane of the @xmath57 galaxy . using our lens model for this cluster ( see  4.2 ) ,",
    "we find that the quasar absorption line spectra probes gas associated with the @xmath57 galaxy on physical scales of 50 kpc . while each quasar image probes the same impact parameter , the individual spectra can be stacked allowing fainter absorption features to be detected .",
    "the relatively shallow spectra we have obtained with mmt provide a first glimpse of the spatial extent of circumgalactic gas around the lensed @xmath57 galaxy .",
    "it is immediately apparent in the 2d spectrum that the quasar continuum in image a is completely extinguished at the wavelength corresponding to ly@xmath13 in the rest - frame of the @xmath57 galaxy .",
    "the centroid of the @xmath57 ly@xmath13 absorption in the quasar spectrum occurs at roughly 4010    with strong absorption spanning @xmath59 - 4020   .",
    "this is not surprisingly somewhat bluer than the wavelength of the ly@xmath13 emission(4012   ) in the galaxy spectrum .",
    "metal absorption from the cgm of the @xmath57 galaxy is also apparent in quasar spectrum .",
    "we clearly detect civ absorption at @xmath60    and tentatively identify absorption from si ii @xmath331526 at 5034    in the quasar spectrum ( figure 5 ) . higher s / n and higher resolution observations are required to characterise the profiles of the absorption lines in both the quasar and galaxy .",
    "deeper spectra of the quasar images should reveal the presence of other ions associated with the @xmath51 galaxy at the 50 kpc impact parameter , providing a more detailed picture of the chemical makeup and ionisation state of material associated with the galaxy .",
    "meanwhile as deeper multi - wavelength images of the field around sdssj2222 + 2745 emerge , it should be possible to identify additional lensed systems behind the @xmath57 galaxy .",
    "spectra of these systems should yield a map of the spatial and angular distribution of outflowing gas associated with this galaxy .",
    "deep spectra of the background lensed galaxies can also provide information on the cgm of the quiescent central lens galaxy .",
    "in particular , if a significant component of cool gas resides in the halos of the early - type lens galaxies ( as expected from the qso absorption line results presented in werk et al .",
    "2012 ) , then we should detect absorption from mg ii or fe ii transitions in the spectra of the background source .",
    "given the range of angular separations between arcs and lenses , the background lensed galaxies probe impact parameters of @xmath61 kpc .",
    "to detect metal line absorption in the background lensed source requires that the lens be at high enough redshift to place either mg ii or fe ii transitions in the optical window .",
    "this limits the test to lenses at @xmath62 ( for mg ii ) and @xmath63 ( for fe ii @xmath332600 ) .",
    "as is clear from table 4 , many of the cassowary systems satisfy these criteria .",
    "we have examined the mmt source spectra for possible signs of absorption from cool gas associated with the lens . as noted in  3.2 , there are two cases in which we suggest that intervening absorption might be associated with the lens . in sdss j0145 - 0455 ( figure 2 ) , the absorption feature at 4244",
    "  might correspond to fe ii @xmath332600 absorption from the central lens",
    ". we should be able to confirm this identification through detection of mg ii absorption , but given the limited resolution of the mmt spectra , mg ii absorption at the lens redshift is blended with the broad civ absorption from the background arc .",
    "a higher resolution spectrum is needed to confirm the nature of the absorption system . in the arc toward sdss j1439 + 3250 ,",
    "we detect absorption at 3970   , which may stem from mg ii at the redshift ( @xmath64 ) of the lens .",
    "this identification is complicated by the fact that we have not yet confirmed the redshift of the arc , making it impossible at this stage to disentangle whether a given absorption feature stems from the arc or lens .",
    "several other systems with mmt spectra show hints of absorption at the wavelength expected for mg ii , but as a result of our limited s / n and low spectral resolution , it is not yet possible to make definitive identifications .    as higher s",
    "/ n and higher resolution spectra of the lensed galaxies emerge , it should become feasible to put constraints on the properties of cool gas associated with quiescent galaxies at @xmath65 .",
    "in the ideal scenario in which the background source forms a complete einstein ring , such absorption line studies offer the potential to create a full two - dimensional map ( at a single impact parameter ) of the cgm of the lens , complementing ongoing work with quasar absorption lines ( e.g. , chen et al .",

    "the discovery of bright gravitationally - lensed galaxies has begun to make a significant impact on our understanding of star formation and feedback at high redshift .",
    "once a field focused on the few bright highly - magnified galaxies known ( e.g. , pettini et al .",

    ", we present the results of a spectroscopic campaign aimed at confirming the redshifts of a larger fraction of the cassowary lensed candidates identified in sdss .",
    "our ultimate goal is to increase the number of suitable targets for resolved ifu infrared spectroscopy ( e.g. , stark et al .",

    "the spectroscopic data used to confirm redshifts in this paper were primarily obtained using the blue and red channel spectrographs on mmt , but we also observed select objects with spectrographs on keck , lbt , and magellan . through these efforts , we have confirmed the redshifts of 25 bright lensed objects ( 24 galaxies and 1 quasar ) in sdss .",
    "only two of the lensed systems ( the galaxy and quasar behind sdss 2222 + 2745 and the @xmath66 galaxy toward sdss j1138 + 2754 ) have been presented with redshifts ( dahle et al .",
    "2012 ; wuyts et al .",

    "we provide a brief discussion of the spectroscopic properties of each system , focusing on the absorption or emission features used for redshift confirmation .    with the new redshift catalog presented in this paper , the total number of spectroscopically - confirmed lensed systems in the cassowary sdss database now stands at 55 .",
    "our initial attempts at lens modelling of the cassowary systems suggests that source magnification factors are typically in the range of 5 - 10@xmath8 .",
    "given the range of sdss apparent magnitudes of the sources , we crudely estimate typical star formation rates ( 20 - 100 m@xmath45 yr@xmath12 ) and stellar masses ( 10@xmath68 - 10@xmath69 m@xmath45 ) of the @xmath1 lensed population .",

    "<S> bright gravitationally lensed galaxies provide our most detailed view of galaxies at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the very brightest ( @xmath0 ) systems enable high spatial and spectral resolution measurements , offering unique constraints on the outflow energetics , metallicity gradients , and stellar populations in high redshift galaxies . yet as a result of the small number of ultra - bright @xmath1 lensed systems with confirmed redshifts , most detailed spectroscopic studies have been limited in their scope . with the goal of increasing the number of bright lensed galaxies available for detailed follow - up </S>",
    "<S> , we have undertaken a spectroscopic campaign targeting wide separation ( @xmath2 3 ) galaxy - galaxy lens candidates within the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . </S>",
    "<S> building on the earlier efforts of our cassowary survey , we target a large sample of candidate galaxy - galaxy lens systems in sdss using a well - established search algorithm which identifies blue arc - like structures situated around luminous red galaxies . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we present a new redshift catalog containing 25 lensed sources in sdss confirmed through spectroscopic follow - up of candidate galaxy - galaxy lens systems . </S>",
    "<S> included in this new sample are two of the brightest galaxies ( @xmath3 and 19.7 ) galaxies known at @xmath1 , a low metallicity ( 12 + log ( o / h ) @xmath4 ) extreme nebular line emitting galaxy at @xmath5 , and numerous systems for which detailed follow - up will be possible . </S>",
    "<S> the source redshifts span @xmath6 ( median redshift of 1.9 ) , and their optical magnitudes are in the range @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we present a brief source - by - source discussion of the spectroscopic properties extracted from our confirmatory spectra and discuss some initial science results . </S>",
    "<S> preliminary lens modelling reveals average source magnifications of 5 - 10@xmath8 . with more than 50 gravitationally - lensed @xmath9 galaxies now confirmed within sdss , it will soon be possible for the first time to develop generalised conclusions from detailed spectroscopic studies of the brightest lensed systems at high redshift .    </S>",
