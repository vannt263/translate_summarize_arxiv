    "soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) are a subclass of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) that are characterized by episodic , dramatic x - ray and optical outbursts , which usually last for several months and recur on a timescale of decades . in the interim",
    "the sxts are in a state of quiescence during which the optical emission is dominated by the luminosity of the faint companion star @xcite . in quiescence",
    "the optical lightcurves exhibit the classical double - humped ellipsoidal modulation , which is due to the differing aspects that the tidally distorted secondary star presents to the observer throughout its orbit @xcite .    in outburst",
    "the high / soft and the low / hard x - ray states are commonly seen . in the high / soft state ,",
    "x - ray emission is dominated by thermal emission from an accretion disc extending close to the last stable orbit around a black hole . in the low / hard state ,",
    "the inner disc is believed to be truncated and emission appears to arise from an extended corona .",
    "similar ideas are involved for the advective models proposed for the quiescent state @xcite , but with the disc truncated at larger radii .",
    "the states of sxts are also classified by their x - ray timing properties ; the high / soft state shows low level red noise , whereas the low / hard state and very high states exhibit band - limited noise but with a low - frequency break at @xmath20.0230hz , and sometimes superposed qpos ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "although the spectral and timing properties during the quiescent state have not been well studied , one might expect similar properties , as the structure of the flow is believed to be similar to that in the low / hard state .",
    "the relatively high quiescent x - ray luminosity of v404cyg  with respect to other sxts indicates that there is still some continuing accretion .",
    "this is also supported by the short - term variability seen at all wavelengths in several quiescent photometric studies of v404cyg  ( @xcite ; zurita , casares & shahbaz 2003 ) .",
    "sub - orbital variability with an amplitude of 0.100.20 mag @xcite which is partly due to a @xmath26hr quasi - periodic oscillation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) is present in the optical .",
    "the h@xmath6 line profile also changes significantly on short timescales @xcite and seems to be correlated with the continuum @xcite .",
    "short timescale variations also appear in the infrared @xcite . at x - ray energies , _ rosat _ ( 0.12.4kev ) saw changes of a factor of 10 on timescales @xmath70.5 day .",
    "more recent observations with _",
    "( 0.3 - 7kev ) showed variability of a factor of 2 in a few ksec @xcite .",
    "finally v404cyg  is also a variable radio source on timescales of days , with typical variability in flux of 0.1 - 0.8 mjy @xcite .",
    "the origin of the variability remains uncertain , the most likely explanations are magnetic reconnection events in the disc or optical emission from an advective region",
    ". the other possibilities such as reprocessed x - ray variability and flickering from the accretion stream impact point are less likely @xcite .",
    "to determine if just one type of variability dominates or if the variability is a combination of mechanisms on different timescales , it is therefore important to perform a comparative study of the class .    in the optical ,",
    "the faintness of the sxts has usually limited the time resolution one can practically achieve .",
    "furthermore , observations have normally been constrained to a single waveband .",
    "ultracamwith 4-m class telescopes provides a unique opportunity not only to study photometric variability on the shortest timescales , but also in more than one waveband simultaneously .",
    "therefore we have embarked upon a programme to study the fast multicolour variability of quiescent sxts with ultracam .",
    "our main aims are to study the multicolour variability of the brighter sxts and to study variability in the fainter ones , faster than previously possible .",
    "we present here high time resolution multicolour observations of one of the brightest sxts , v404cyg .",
    "multicolour photometric observations of v404cyg  were taken with ultracamon the william herschel telescope atop la palma during the period 2002 sep 9 to 13 .",
    "ultracamis an ultra - fast , triple - beam ccd camera .",
    "the light is split into three wavelengths colours ( blue , green and red ) by two dichroic beamsplitters and then passes through a filter .",
    "the detectors are three back - illuminated , thinned , marconi frame - transfer 1024@xmath81024 active area ccd chips with a pixel scale of 0.3arcsecs / pixel .",
    "the ccds are cooled using a three - stage peltier device and water chiller , resulting in negligible dark current ( especially at these short integration times ) . with the frame transfer mode ,",
    "the dead - time is essentially zero ( for further details see @xcite ) .",
    "our observations were taken using the sloan @xmath9 , @xmath1and @xmath0filters with effective wavelengths of 3550 , 4750  and 7650  respectively .",
    "for the first 5 nights ( sep 9 to 12 ) , we used an exposure time of 5.0sec , which was short enough to give reasonable counts in the @xmath1and @xmath0bands .",
    "given the faintness of the object ( @xmath10=20.6 , @xmath11=18.4 ) and the short exposure times , few counts were obtained in the @xmath9 band . on the last night ( sep 13 ) we decreased the exposure time to 0.237sec . only data in the @xmath0band were usable .",
    "from hereafter , we will refer to the data taken with exposure times of 5.0 sec and 0.237sec as the `` slow''and `` fast''data respectively .",
    "the weather conditions during the observing run were on the whole very good .",
    "the night of sep 9 suffered from severe seeing ( 2 ) during the end of the night .",
    "no useful data could be obtained on sep 11 due to cloud .",
    "the night of sep 10 was photometric , so we observed the flux standard bd+353659 @xcite in order to determine the @xmath9 , @xmath1and @xmath0band instrumental zeropoints , which were then used to calibrate the data .",
    "on sep 14 , due to an earthing problem , the electronic bias level occasionally increased by a factor of 2 , however , this only affected runs 14(b ) and ( c ) .",
    "a log of the observations is given in table[table : log ] .",
    "the pipeline reduction procedures were used to debias and flat - field the data .",
    "the same pipeline was also used to determine lightcurves for v404cyg  and several comparison stars by extracting the counts using aperture photometry . as there is a line - of - sight contaminating star 1.5arcsec north of v404cyg",
    ", we obtained the combined counts using an aperture sufficient enough to encompass both stars .",
    "we determined lightcurves with different sized apertures , ranging from to 1.8 to 4.2arcsec .",
    "the optimal and most reliable results , given the contaminating star , were obtained using a large aperture of 3arcsec .",
    "the count ratio of v404cyg  with respect to the local standard ( 3.6 s 75.8e of v404cyg ) was then determined by subtracting the count ratio of the contaminating star with respect to the local standard determined from images taken under good seeing conditions ( 0.7arsecs ) , from the combined count ratio of v404cyg  ( i.e. v404cyg  + line - of - sight star ) with respect to the local standard . the local standard was chosen to have a similar colour to the contaminating star .",
    "the count ratio of the contaminating star to the local standard is 0.065 and 0.143 in the @xmath1and @xmath0bands respectively .",
    "the magnitude of v404cyg  was then obtained using the observed magnitude of the local standard , @xmath1=16.90 and @xmath0=15.12 ( @xmath70.01 mag uncertainty ) .",
    "the magnitude of the contaminating star was @xmath1=19.87 and @xmath0=17.23 .",
    "as a check of the photometry and systematics in the reduction and extraction procedures , we also computed lightcurves of a comparison star ( 13.2s , 17.1e of v404cyg ) .",
    "the magnitude of the comparison star was @xmath1=18.90@xmath120.03 , @xmath0=16.55@xmath120.02 .",
    "the mean @xmath1and @xmath0band magnitudes of v404cyg  were 19.77 and 16.57 respectively .",
    "we estimate the relative photometric accuracy to be 3.0 and 0.9 percent for the slow @xmath1and @xmath0band respectively and 6.0 percent for the `` fast''@xmath0band data .    by co - adding all the images from run 10(b ) on sep 10 taken under good seeing conditions , we estimate @xmath9=22.6@xmath120.7 for v404cyg .",

    "the x - ray transient gs2023 + 338 was discoverd during its ourburst in may 1989 by the all sky monitor aboard the ginga satelite @xcite .",
    "its high x - ray luminonsity suggested that , like other x - ray transients , the system was a close binary with an accreting compact object .",
    "the x - ray source was soon identifed with the known variable star v404cyg , which had been classified as a nova after its 1938 outburst @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations taken when v404cyg  was in quiescence revealed the companion to the x - ray source to be a g or early k - type star in an orbit with a period of 6.473d , which when combined with the secondary star s radial velocity curve implies a mass function of 6.3@xmath120.3@xmath13@xcite . later on , additional measurements determined the secondary star s rotational broadening , and refined the spectral type of the secondary star and the orbital parameters ; the orbital period is @xmath14=6.4714d and semi - amplitude of the secondary star s radial velocity curve is @xmath15=208.5@xmath16 , giving a mass function of f(m)=6.08@xmath120.08@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "since this mass function , which provides a firm lower limit to the compact object s mass , exceeds the maximum mass of a neutron star ( @xmath23.3@xmath13 ; @xcite ) , the compact object in v404cyg  is almost certainly a black hole .",
    "optical photometry of v404cyg  in the @xmath17-band revealed the secondary star s ellipsoidal variation @xcite but these were , however , severely contaminated by short - term variability .",
    "therefore , in an effort to avoid these problems , @xcite observed the lightcurve of v404cyg  in the @xmath18-band , where the flux from the k0iv star is substantially greater @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the ellipisoidal variations , which results from the tidal disortion of the secondary star gives the binary inclination angle , combined with spectroscopic observations yields the mass of the binary components .",
    "they concluded that the contamination in the infrared was small and deduced the black hole mass to be 12@xmath122@xmath13 .",
    "@xcite estimated the interstellar reddening to v404cyg , by comparing its observed colours with those of a k0iii star , after allowing for the accretion disc contribution to the observed flux .",
    "they obtained @xmath19 and a lower limit of @xmath20 .",
    "however , as one can see , the reddening determined in this way depends heavily on the disc contamination in the optical , which the authors measure with large uncertainites",
    ". a more accurate determination of the reddening was obtained by @xcite who obtained the @xmath18-band lightcurve of v404cyg   in quiescence and determined the binary inclination angle by modeling the secondary star s ellipsoidal modulation .",
    "assuming that the secondary star is a stripped giant @xcite they also determined limits to the reddening and distance to v404cyg , by matching the model stripped giant luminosity to that of the secondary star as predicted by the ellipsoidal model .",
    "assuming no disc contamination in the @xmath18-band , a reasonable assumption given that the disc contamination measured in the @xmath18-band was found to be negligible @xcite , and 10 percent in the @xmath11-band , they obtained 2.2@xmath213.3 ( 90 percent confidence ) .",
    "although the determination of the reddening through this method is model dependant , the uncertainites in the disc fraction and model dependant parameters such as the binary masses and inclination angle are less in the infrared compared to in the optical . given the uncertainties in determining the reddening using optical and infrared data , throughout this paper we will use a range of values for the reddening , 2.2@xmath214.0 and a central value of @xmath222.8 .",
    "the optical lightcurve of v404cyg  is dominated by the secondary star s ellipsoidal modulation , which is due to the observer seeing differing aspects of the tidally distorted secondary star .",
    "this modulation gives rise to two maxima and minima per orbital cycle .",
    "however , superimposed on the ellipsoidal modulation are the large 6hr flares seen previously @xcite and also many rapid flares ( @xmath20.5hr ) , similar to what is observed in the short orbital period sxts ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that the secondary star s ellipsoidal modulation is not linked to the variability , therefore if we want to determine the flux of the flares , its contribution must be first removed from the lightcurves .",
    "figure  1 shows the observed data .",
    "large amplitude flares which last a few hours or more , are observed only on sep 10 , 12 and 13 and are most likely related to the well known 6hr flare / qpo ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . on sep 9",
    "no large flare is seen . in order to isolate the flux of the flare",
    "we assume that the light produced by a flare is simply added to the quiescent spectrum , where the quiescent spectrum is the light from the secondary star s ellipsoidal modulation and the non - variable accretion disc .",
    "we first de - redden the observed magnitudes using the central value for @xmath23 of 2.8 ( see section[background ] ) and the ratio @xmath24=3.1 ( @xcite ) , giving @xmath1and @xmath0extinction values of 3.34 and 1.79 mags respectively and then convert the sloan ab magnitudes to flux density .",
    "we use the x - ray binary model described in @xcite with the binary mass ratio and inclination angle given in @xcite and @xcite respectively , to determine the ellipsoidal modulation .",
    "the model is not set up to compute sloan magnitudes , so we first compute the johnson - cousins magnitudes and then convert to sloan magnitudes using the colour transformations @xcite . we shift the model ellipsoidal lightcurve so as to fit the lower - envelope of the observed lightcurve .",
    "we use the data at phase 0.85 ( sep 9 ) to anchor the fit , since on this night the large 6hr flare is not seen and so the lower - envelope of these data most likely represents the light from the secondary star and non - variable accretion disc .",
    "figure  1 shows the data and the scaled ellipsoidal model .",
    "clearly the model fails to fit the @xmath1and @xmath0data near phase 0.0 ( sep 10 ) .",
    "this suggests that the accretion disc light is variable , most likely due to a residual superhump modulation as is observed in other quiescent sxts ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this will obviously introduce uncertainties in the subtraction procedure , however , we can obtain a good estimate for the flux of the flares , since on sep 12 and 13 the model fit partially matches the end and beginning of the large flares respectively . finally , the scaled ellipsoidal modulation is subtracted from the de - reddened lightcurve yielding the colour of the flares ( see figure  2 ) .    one should note that the conversion from magnitudes to flux density is colour dependant . in order to estimate the scale of this effect , we determine the fluxes obtained using spectra with different power - law indices ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the spectrum of the flares has a mean flux density ratio of @xmath260.40 ( see figure  2 ) which corresponds to a spectrum with a power - law index of @xmath2 - 2 .",
    "the ellipsoidal model has a colour ( @xmath1-@xmath0)=1.67 which corresponds to a spectrum with a power - law index of -2.8 .",
    "using these models , we estimate that the conversion from sloan ab mags to flux density units introduces an uncertainty in the colour @xmath27 of @xmath210 percent .",
    "it should also be noted that the residual superhump will introduce an additional uncertainty in the colour of the flare .",
    "since the superhump originates in the outer parts of the disc , it is most likely to have a cool spectrum .",
    "theoretical models for the behaviour of the quiescent accretion disc in v404cyg  indicates that the outer disc is optically thick and has a temperature of @xmath22000k ( narayan , barret & mcclintock 1997 ) .",
    "if this also represents the colour of the superhump , then assuming the superhump radiates as a blackbody , we estimate that it would add an additional uncertainty of 2 percent in the determination of @xmath27 .",
    "note that these uncertainties are much less than that due to the reddening ( see section[flarecharacteristics ] ) .",
    "[ profile ]      although large amplitude flares are observed on more than one night , it is only on sep 10 that a large flare is observed throughout the event .",
    "the shape of the large flares seem to be symmetric with similar rise and decay times . superimposed on these large flares",
    "are many rapid events which last typically @xmath20.5hr . furthermore , superimposed on these flares ,",
    "are still shorter term events on timescales of mins which show unresolved peaks ( see figure  3 ) .",
    "this makes it difficult to determine the exact shape of the flare events ; there is an indication that some of the flares on the shortest timescales have a burst - like profile [ e.g. see flare ( b ) on sep 13 ] .",
    "however , in general all the flare events appear to have a linear rise and decay . in table[table : flares ] we estimate some of the characteristics of the individual distinct flares which are shown in figure  3 .",
    "the flares typically have a rise time of 2mins and a duration of 6mins .    at first sight , once clearly notices that the monochromatic flux in @xmath0is larger than that it @xmath1 , at the peak of the large flares , i.e the flare at its peak has a relatively red spectrum . in general",
    "the colour flux ratio @xmath27 of these flares increases , becoming more blue at the peak .",
    "after the peak is reached , the flux and colour decreases becoming more red .",
    "the exception is the large flare on sep 13 ; the colour seems to increase continuously as the flare proceeds .",
    "the most prominent and distinct rapid flares are marked in figure  2 .",
    "the mean flux ratio @xmath27 of the large flares is @xmath20.4 .",
    "if we use the extreme values for the reddening @xmath23=4.0 and @xmath23=2.2 , then the flux ratio @xmath27 changes by a factor of 0.53 and 1.36 respectively .    to test if the flaring in the @xmath1and @xmath0bands are simultaneous we calculated the cross - correlation function .",
    "the cross - correlation function was symmetric and no time lag was found , so we conclude that the flaring in the two bands is simultaneous ( see figure  4 ) .",

    "although the sampling of ultracamis perfectly uniform , we use the method of lomb - scargle to compute the periodograms @xcite .",
    "the lomb - scargle method was chosen so that we could combine consecutive runs and confidently compute the periodogram . also ,",
    "in order to allow a direct comparison with x - ray pds , we use the same normalisation method as is commonly used in x - ray astronomy , where the power is normalised to the fractional root mean amplitude squared per hertz .",
    "the advantage of this kind of normalisation is that fractional rms amplitudes can be directly estimated from the level of the pds @xcite .",

    "a qpo feature with a centroid frequency at 0.78mhz (= 21.5mins ) is present , not surprising given that one can clearly see variability on timescales of 0.5 - 1.0hrs in the lightcurves .",
    "the fractional root mean squared amplitude is 3 and 1.3 percent for the @xmath1and @xmath0band qpos and was computed by integrating the gaussian function and taking the square root .",
    "we used run14(a ) , run14(d ) and run14(e ) to compute the pds .",

    "again the derived pds was flat , which is exactly as expected for white noise data ( see figure  5 ) .",
    "the outer regions of the accretion discs in quiescent sxts and dwarf novae ( dne ) are assumed to be very similar .",
    "therefore if the optical variability observed in the quiescent sxts originates from these outer regions , then they should have similar properties to those observed in quiescent dne .",
    "@xcite has performed a study of the rapid variability in cataclysmic variables .",
    "the slope of the pds in quiescent dne ( 1.6 to 2.6 ) seems to be in general steeper than those observed in quiescent sxts [ -1.0 to -1.52 ; @xcite and @xcite ] .",
    "this suggests that there is either more low - frequency variability in the lightcurves of quiescent dne compared to quiescent sxts , or that there is more high - frequency variability in the sxts .",

    "the slope of the @xmath0pds in v404cyg  is steeper than the @xmath1slope , suggesting that there is more low - frequency disc variability in @xmath0compared to @xmath1 .",
    "this difference could be attributed to more variability from outer regions of the disc , such as the stream / disc impact region or more high frequency variability in @xmath1from the inner disk .",
    "thus one expects the slope of the pds to be dependent on the observed waveband .",
    "@xcite determined the pds of the quiescent sxt a062000 and found a possible break in the pds at 0.95mhz , a feature which is also seen in the low / hard state of sxts ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "although the origin of the break frequency is uncertain , it could be related to the size of the inner advective region ; a low break frequency in quiescence would then be expected , as the advective region should be larger . if the break frequency is associated with a dynamical timescale , then it should vary as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the radius of the advective region ( see section[qpo - adaf ] ) .",
    "furthermore , as noted by @xcite the break frequency most probably scales with some characteristic length scale , which could depend on other parameters , as well as the inner disc radius .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that the observations of quiescent bh sxts can be explained by a two - component accretion flow model .",
    "the geometry of the flow consists of an inner hot advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) that extends from the black hole horizon to a transition radius @xmath38=@xmath39 @xmath40  ( @xmath40= @xmath41 is the schwarzschild radius for a black hole with mass @xmath42 ) and a thin accretion disk that extends from @xmath38  to an outer radius @xmath43 i.e. the radius of the accretion disc . a key feature of the adaf model of quiescent bh sxts is its low radiative efficiency .",
    "the bulk of the viscously dissipated energy is stored in the gas and is advected with the flow into the black hole .",
    "this naturally explains the unusually low luminosity of bh sxts , since in ns sxts , all the advected energy is radiated from the neutron star surface , resulting in a much higher overall radiative efficiency @xcite .",
    "an adaf has turbulent gas at all radii , with a variety of timescales , ranging from a slow timescale at the transition radius down to nearly the free - fall time close to the black hole . in principle",
    ", interactions between the hot inner adaf and the cool , outer thin disk , at or near the transition radius , can be a source of optical variability , due to synchrotron emission by the hot electrons in the adaf . for an adaf",
    "the variability could be quasi - periodic and would have a characteristic timescale given by a multiple of the keplerian rotation period at @xmath38 @xmath44s . where @xmath37 is the absolute radius and @xmath45 is in units of @xmath40 .",
    "one also expects slower variations , since the mass supply to the adaf originates at @xmath38@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that it is difficult to produce such rapid variations using the thin disc models .",
    "@xcite used the maximum velocity observed in the h@xmath6 emission line arising from the quiescent thin accretion disc to estimate @xmath38 .",
    "however , they note that measuring the maximum velocity is difficult , and so their estimate of 10@xmath46@xmath40  for @xmath38  should only be considered as an upper limit .",
    "if we assume that the 0.78mhz qpo feature observed in the pds ( see section[powerspectrum ] ) is the dynamical timescale at the transition radius , then @xmath38  lies at 10@xmath47@xmath40 , which is consistent with that estimated by @xcite .",
    "we can write @xmath38  in terms of the accretion disc radius .",
    "for the binary parameters of v404cyg  the outer radius of the disc lies at @xmath43=@xmath48@xmath40  or 12@xmath3 , and so @xmath38  lies at 0.04@xmath49or 0.5@xmath3 .",
    "it is interesting to note the similar timescales of the qpos we have discovered in v404cyg with those found in various x - ray / uv / optical observations of the double - degenerate lmxb , 4u1626 - 67 .",
    "@xcite used fast ccd photometry to reveal the presence of 3 oscillations : the 130mhz pulsation ( i.e. the well - known 7.66s x - ray / optical pulsation of the neutron star ) , a 48mhz ( @xmath220s ) qpo ( a broad oscillation seen before in x - ray , optical and uv wavebands ) and a 1mhz qpo .",
    "this latter oscillation had not been seen before , is not present in any x - ray observations , is quasi - sinusoidal in appearance , and is dramatically stronger in far uv hst data .",
    "@xcite concluded that the first 2 oscillations were clearly x - ray driven and the optical / uv analogues were due to reprocessing in the disc / companion star .",
    "however , the 1mhz qpo origin is extremely puzzling .",
    "the timescale is actually the same as the pronounced x - ray and optical flaring seen from 4u1626 - 67 during the 1970s and 80s , but this flaring behaviour has vanished since the torque reversal that occurred in 1990 . with no x - ray oscillation to drive this process , @xcite suggested that the 1mhz qpo is due to `` warping '' of the inner accretion disc and is of an appropriate timescale for the radius of the inner disc that is set by the magnetospheric corotation radius . in this way , the modulation would be expected to be much greater in the far uv ( inner disc ) than the optical ( in the outer , shielded regions ) .",
    "it is possible that , in spite of the fact that v404cyg almost certainly hosts a @xmath212  m@xmath50 black hole , this analogy can be applied from 4u1626 - 67 .",
    "the difference is in the origin of the truncated inner disc , which for v404cyg in x - ray quiescence is expected to be in an adaf phase @xcite .",
    "as one can see from figure  2 , on most of the nights there are numerous rapid flares ( @xmath70.5hr ) superimposed on the single large event ( @xmath2few hrs ) . given the uncertainties in the data , it is difficult to determine the shape and hence the physical parameters of these rapid events .",
    "we can however comment on the general physical properties of the flares using the large events ( @xmath2few hrs ) . using the flare flux density lightcurves",
    "we determine the flux density ratio @xmath27 and the blackbody temperature @xmath51 and equivalent radius @xmath52 . to determine the colour temperature corresponding to a given flux density ratio",
    ", we integrate blackbody functions with the ccd and sloan filter response functions and then determine the @xmath27 flux density ratio . given this blackbody temperature",
    "we can then determine the corresponding radius of the region that produces the observed dereddened flux at a distance of 3.5kpc @xcite .",
    "also , using the flux density ratio , the power - law index @xmath6 of the spectrum ( @xmath53 ) can be obtained .",
    "one can easily show that the power - law index is given by @xmath54 .    for sep 9 ,",
    "the flux density ratio @xmath27 remains constant at 0.5 ; @xmath6 and @xmath51 have constant values of @xmath2 - 2 and 5100k respectively .",
    "for the single large flare events on sep 10 and 13 , @xmath27 is correlated with the flux of the flare ; @xmath27 peaks at @xmath20.3 ; @xmath6 and @xmath51 peaks at @xmath2 - 2.5 and 4100k respectively .",
    "on sep 12 one can see that the blackbody radius and flare flux are correlated i.e. as the flare flux increases and decreases so does the equivalent blackbody radius .",
    "the blackbody radius increases from @xmath21@xmath3to @xmath22@xmath3 . the same is seen during the decay of the large flare on sep 10 , but to a lesser extent .",
    "however , it should be noted that the uncertainties in the reddening ( see section[background ] ) , which typically correspond to @xmath12700k in the @xmath51 estimates , are such that we can not comment on any colour or temperature variation during the flares .",
    "the peak flux produced by the large flare arises from a region that has a projected blackbody radius of 2@xmath3 and the rapid flares most likely from smaller regions . in other words ,",
    "the emitting area at the peak of the large flare covers at least 3 percent of the total disc emitting area .",
    "note that given the data presented here , we can not state where in the disc these large flares arise .",
    "however , it is most likely that the large flares originate in the outer regions of the disc ( see section[flarewhere ] ) .    during the large flares observed in v404cyg",
    "the power - law index of the spectral energy distribution is @xmath22.0 ( a range of 1.5 to 2.5 , depending on the flare ) .",
    "it is difficult to explain this in terms of optically thin synchrotron emission , unless the electrons follow a much steeper power - law energy distribution ( @xmath55 ) . for",
    "solar and stellar flares the power - law index of the electron energy distribution @xmath56 is @xmath22 @xcite , which corresponds to a frequency spectrum with a power - law index of @xmath6=0.5 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the frequency power - law index oberved in v404cyg  @xmath6 of @xmath22.0 implies a much steeper index for the electron energy distribution of @xmath56=5 .",
    "however , given the uncertainites in the reddening and therefore in the flux density ratio @xmath27 ( see section[background ] ) , we find a range of values for @xmath56 of 3.6 to 7.5 .",
    "it could be that the electrons are thermal and thus do not follow a power - law energy distribution . also , given that the geometry and physics around a black hole is presumably more extreme , such a steep index for the electron energy distribution is not completely implausible .",
    "the simple model for the flares of blackbody radiation from a heated region of the disc s photosphere ( i.e. photospheric in origin ) is unlikely .",
    "a more likely model for a thermal flare is emission from an optically thin layer of recombining hydrogen , which is essentially the mechanism generally accepted for solar flares .",
    "we therefore determine the continuum emission spectrum of an lte slab of hydrogen and then calculate the expected flux density ratio @xmath27 in the @xmath1and @xmath0bands using the same method as the blackbody case .",
    "we find that a continuum slab temperature of 8000k with a baryon column density of 10@xmath58@xmath59 ( taken from @xcite ) gives @xmath27=0.30 ; propagating the uncertainty in the reddening ( see section[background ] ) , we find the range for the slab temperature to be 5500k and 9100k . it should be noted that the hydrogen slab model does not include the contribution from balmer emission lines . since the @xmath1filter includes h@xmath60 ,",
    "our determination of the flux density ratio @xmath27 is biased .",
    "however , we can estimate the amount of bias given the h@xmath60 flux and equivalent width , 0.20mjy and 10  respectively @xcite . since the @xmath1filter has a width of @xmath22000 the contribution of the h@xmath60 emission line to the @xmath1flux density in v404cyg is only 1 percent , in constrast to that in aeaqr @xcite .",
    "since we only have observations in two wavebands , we can not accurately determine the physical parameters of the flares .",
    "however , it should be noted that the spectrum of the flare seems to be similar to that observed in aeaqr @xcite . using the colour information for the large flare events",
    ", we can say that the large flares arise from a region which extends a projected area which has an equivalent @xmath52 of @xmath22@xmath3 .",
    "one should regard the equivalent @xmath52 estimate as a lower limit , because the emission mechanism is unlikely to be blackbody .",
    "in general the rapid flares seem to arise from optically thin gas which has a peak temperature of @xmath28000k in the continuum .",
    "however , to obtain a more accurate estimate of the physical conditions of the flares , one must resolve the balmer jump and paschen continuum .",
    "spectroscopic observations suggest that the whole disc participates in the large flares , since the whole h@xmath6 emission line profile changes @xcite .",
    "this seems to contradict our earlier results , which suggest that the large flares arise from regions that cover only 3 percent of the disc s total area .",
    "however , this most likely indicates that the emission is optically thin , or that the emission area is small .",
    "also , given the low resolution of the spectroscopy , we can only really say that material from all around the disc is contributing , given that the line profile changes observed extend across the whole line profile and appear double - peaked .",
    "it is not possible to exclude the flares from arising from only the inner regions of the disc .",
    "@xcite have presented arguments that suggest the most likely mechanism for the flares is by local magnetic reconnection events in or above the accretion disc .",
    "it is believed that a dynamo mechanism , driven by the strong shear produced by differential rotation , operates in accretion discs ( @xcite ) .",
    "regions of oppositely directed magnetic fields develop within the disc or between the disc and corona and reconnect explosively , resulting in a flare @xcite .",
    "the duration of the flare is directly related to the shearing timescale . as suggested by @xcite , assuming that the range of flare durations observed in the sxts reflect their location in the accretion disc , then the flares with the longest duration represent the shearing timescale in the outer parts of the disc .",
    "thus the maximum flare duration should be limited by the outer disc radius and v404cyg  should show short - term variability , similar to what is observed in a062000 .",
    "the very rapid flares ( @xmath2mins ) observed in v404cyg  ( see figure  3 ) have a similar timescale to those observed in a062000 @xcite and seems to support the scenario that the large flares ( @xmath2 few hrs ) are produced in regions further out in the disc than the rapid ( @xmath20.5hr ) and very rapid ( @xmath2mins ) flares .    using the colour information about the large events ( @xmath2hrs )",
    ", we can say that the large flares are produced from a region which extends an equivalent blackbody radius of @xmath22@xmath3 .",
    "we can not determine the emitting area of the rapid flares ( @xmath20.5hr ) as the result may be biased due to the large flares .",
    "however , if our interpretation of the 21.5min qpo feature is correct , then these rapid flares are most likely produced near the transition radius of the adaf , in the inner parts of the disc .",
    "we can not determine the exact mechanism for the flare production .",
    "the flares could arise in optically thin gas with a temperature of @xmath28000k , most likely in a corona above the accretion disc , or from optically thin synchrotron emission .",
    "@xcite have argued that an adaf model is not required to reproduce the observed x ",
    "ray luminosities of quiescent sxts .",
    "they propose a model which consists of a standard thin disc with a hot corona , powered by magnetic flares .",
    "although this scenario seems appealing , it is difficult to see how the thin disc model could produce rapid variations .",
    "however , it should be noted that the explosive magnetic reconnection model described in @xcite could produce rapid variations from a thin disc , similar to an adaf .",
    "our observations suggest that for the rapid flares ( @xmath20.5hr ) at least , they are produced near the transition radius .",
    "however , it is only by obtaining precise velocity information about the flares , can we begin to place constraints on the exact location of the flares in the accretion disc .",
