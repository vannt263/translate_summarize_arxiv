    "neutrinos seem to be likely candidates for carrying features of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) @xcite . apart from masses and mixings , charge radius , magnetic moments and electric dipole moments are also signs of new physics , and are of relevance in terrestrial experiments , the solar neutrino problem @xcite , astrophysics and cosmology @xcite .    at the present time",
    ", all the available experimental data for electroweak processes can be well understood in the context of the standard model of the electroweak interactions ( sm ) @xcite , except the results of the super - kamiokande experiment on the neutrino mass @xcite . however",
    ", super - kamiokande not is the only experiments in disagreement with the sm , also are includen at gallex , sage , gno , homestake and lsnd @xcite .",
    "hence , the sm is the starting point for all the extended gauge models . in other words ,",
    "any gauge group with physical sense must have as a subgroup the @xmath5 group of the standard model , in such a way that its predictions agree with those of the sm at low energies .",
    "the purpose of the extended theories is to explain some fundamental aspects which are not clarified in the framework of the sm .",
    "one of these aspects is the origin of the parity violation at the current energies .",
    "the left - right symmetric model ( lrsm ) based on the @xmath6 gauge group @xcite gives an answer to that problem , since it restores the parity symmetry at high energies and gives their violations at low energies as a result of the breaking of gauge symmetry .",
    "detailed discussions on lrsm can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "although in the framework of the sm , neutrinos are assumed to be electrically neutral .",
    "electromagnetic properties of the neutrino are discussed in many gauge theories beyond the sm .",
    "electromagnetic properties of the neutrino may manifest themselves in a magnetic moment of the neutrino as well as in a non vanishing charge radius , both making the neutrino subject to the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "the present paper is an extension of previous work by one of the authors ( m. maya _",
    "_ ) , considering electromagnetic properties of the neutrino . in this work ,",
    "we start from a left - right symmetric model ( lrsm ) with massive dirac neutrinos left and right , with an electromagnetic structure that consists of a charge radius and of an anomalous magnetic moment , and we calculated the cross - section of the scattering @xmath7 . the feynman diagrams which contribute to the process @xmath8 are shown in fig",
    ". 1 .    in previous papers @xcite , possible corrections at the couplings of the fermion with the gauge boson were calculated , in particular the couplings @xmath9 and @xmath10 of leptons with the neutral boson @xmath11 , which have been measured with great precision in lep and charm ii @xcite . in this work",
    "we calculate the simultaneous contribution of the charge radius , of the additional @xmath12 gauge boson and of the angle @xmath2 parameter of the lrsm at the constants of couplings @xmath3 and @xmath4 . the charge radius in the lrsm considered is simply treated as a new parameter .",
    "one is thus dealing with a purely phenomenological analysis .",
    "for an analysis of the electromagnetic form factors of the neutrino from a point of see theoretical in left - right models , see for example the ref .",

    "we will assume that a massive dirac neutrino is characterized by two phenomenological parameters , a magnetic moment @xmath13 , expressed in units of the electron bohr magnetons , and a charge radius @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , the expression for the amplitude @xmath15 of the process @xmath16 due only to @xmath17 and @xmath18 exchange , according to the diagrams depicted in fig . 1 is given by    @xmath19    with    @xmath20    the neutrino electromagnetic vertex , where @xmath21 is the momentum transfer and @xmath22 are the electromagnetic form factors of the neutrino .",

    "the scattering cross - section in the center of mass system ( where @xmath42 is the square of the center - of - mass energy ) is given by    @xmath43    where the square of the total amplitude of transition @xmath44 is given in the eq .",
