    "this paper is a continuation of @xcite to which we will frequently refer in this paper . it will be followed by a third part @xcite , which deals with the critical case . in these papers , we study the random matrix ensemble with external source @xmath1 @xmath8 defined on @xmath9 hermitian matrices @xmath4 , with gaussian potential @xmath10 and with external source @xmath11 in the physics literature , the ensemble ( [ extsource1 ] ) was studied in a series of papers of brzin and hikami @xcite-@xcite , and p. zinn - justin @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our aim is to obtain rigorous results on eigenvalue correlations in the large @xmath12-limit using the steepest descent / stationary phase method for riemann - hilbert ( rh ) problems @xcite , thereby extending the works @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite who treated the unitary invariant case ( i.e. , @xmath13 ) with rh techniques .",
    "while the unitary invariant case is connected with orthogonal polynomials @xcite , the ensemble ( [ extsource1 ] ) is connected with multiple orthogonal polynomials @xcite . these are characterized by a matrix rh problem @xcite , and the eigenvalue correlation kernel of ( [ extsource1 ] ) has a direct expression in terms of the solution of this rh problem , see @xcite , @xcite and also formula ( [ kernelk ] ) below .",
    "the rh problem for ( [ extsource1 ] ) has size @xmath14 if @xmath15 is the number of distinct eigenvalues of @xmath1 .",
    "so with the choice ( [ extsource2 ] ) , the rh problem is @xmath7-matrix valued .",
    "the asymptotic analysis of rh problems has been mostly restricted to the @xmath16 case .",
    "the analysis of larger size rh problems presents some novel technical features as already demonstrated in @xcite and @xcite . in the present paper",
    "another new feature appears , namely at a critical stage in the analysis we perform a _ global opening of lenses_. this global opening of lenses requires a global understanding of an associated riemann surface , which is explicitly known for the gaussian case ( [ gausspotential ] ) .",
    "this is why we restrict ourselves to ( [ gausspotential ] ) although in principle our methods are applicable to more general polynomial @xmath17 .",
    "the gaussian case has some special relevance in its own right as well .",
    "indeed , first of all we note that for ( [ gausspotential ] ) we can complete the square in ( [ extsource1 ] ) , and then it follows that @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a gue matrix .",
    "so in the gaussian case the ensemble ( [ extsource1 ] ) is an example of a random + deterministic model , see also @xcite-@xcite .    a second interpretation of the gaussian model comes from non - intersecting brownian paths .",
    "this can be seen from the joint probability density for the eigenvalues of @xmath4 , which by the harishchandra / itzykson - zuber formula @xcite , @xcite , takes the form @xmath20 for the case ( [ gausspotential ] ) .",
    "here @xmath21 are the eigenvalues of @xmath1 , which are assumed to be all distinct in ( [ jointpdf ] ) . in the case of coinciding eigenvalues of @xmath1",
    "we have to take the appropriate limit of ( [ jointpdf ] ) , see formula ( 3.17 ) in @xcite .",
    "formula ( [ jointpdf ] ) also arises as the distribution of non - intersecting brownian paths .",
    "consider @xmath12 independent brownian motions ( in fact brownian bridges ) on the line , starting at some fixed points @xmath22 at time @xmath23 , ending at some fixed points @xmath24 at time @xmath25 , and conditioned not to intersect for @xmath26 .",
    "then by a theorem of karlin and mcgregor @xcite , the joint probability density of the positions of the brownian bridges at time @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the transition kernel of the brownian motion and @xmath29 is a normalization constant .",
    "let us consider a scaled brownian motion for which @xmath30 and let us take a limit when all initial points @xmath31 converge to the origin . in this case formula ( [ b1 ] ) takes the form @xmath32 this coincides with ( [ jointpdf ] ) if we make the identifications @xmath33 so at any time @xmath26 the positions of @xmath12 non - intersecting brownian bridges starting at @xmath34 and ending at specified points are distributed as the eigenvalues of a gaussian random matrix with external source .",
    "the connection between random matrices and non - intersecting random paths is actually well - known , see e.g.  the recent works @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references cited therein .",
    "zinn - justin showed that the @xmath35-point correlation functions for the eigenvalues of @xmath4 have determinantal form @xmath36 it was shown in @xcite that the average characteristic polynomial @xmath37\\ ] ] is a multiple orthogonal polynomial of type ii , which for the gaussian case ( [ gausspotential ] ) is a multiple hermite polynomial , see @xcite , @xcite , and that the correlation kernel @xmath38 can be expressed in terms of the solution of the rh problem for multiple orthogonal polynomials @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "we state the rh problem here for the gaussian case ( [ gausspotential ] ) and for the external source ( [ extsource2 ] ) where @xmath12 is even",

    "we suppose @xmath12 is even , and we let half of the @xmath70 s coincide with @xmath71 and the other half with @xmath72 .",
    "then as explained before , at time @xmath26 the ( rescaled ) positions of the brownian paths coincide with the eigenvalues of the gaussian random matrix with external source ( [ extsource2 ] ) where @xmath73 the phase transition at @xmath3 corresponds to @xmath74 so , by theorem [ maintheo1 ] , the limiting distribution of the brownian paths as @xmath75 is supported by one interval when @xmath76 and by two intervals when @xmath77 . at the critical time",
    "@xmath78 the two groups of brownian paths split , with one group ending at @xmath79 at @xmath80 and the other at @xmath72 .    as in @xcite",
    "we formulate our main result in terms of a rescaled version of the kernel @xmath38 @xmath81 for some function @xmath82 .",

    "@xmath90 is the constant from ( [ density1 ] ) .",
    "theorem [ maintheo2 ] is similar to the main theorems theorem 1.2 and theorem 1.3 of @xcite .",
    "it expresses that the local eigenvalue correlations show the universal behavior as @xmath91 , both in the bulk and at the edge , that is well - known from unitary random matrix models .",
    "so the result itself is not that surprising .",
    "to obtain theorem [ maintheo2 ] we use the deift / zhou steepest descent method for rh problems and a main tool is the three - sheeted riemann surface associated with equation ( [ pastur2 ] ) as in @xcite .",
    "there is however an important technical difference with @xcite . for @xmath5 , the branch points of the riemann surface are all real , and they correspond to the four edge points @xmath59 , @xmath68 of the support as described in theorem [ maintheo1 ] ( c ) . for @xmath92 ,",
    "two branch points are purely imaginary and they have no direct meaning for the problem at hand .",
    "the other two branch points are real and they correspond to the edge points @xmath59 as in theorem [ maintheo1 ] ( a )",
    ". see figure 1 for the sheet structure of the riemann surface .",
    "the branch points on the non - physical sheets result in a non - trivial modification of the steepest descent method .",
    "as already mentioned before , one of the steps involves a global opening of lenses , and this is the main new technical contribution of this paper .    the rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of the theorems with the deift / zhou steepest descent method for rh problems .",
    "it consists of a sequence of transformations which reduce the original rh problem to a rh problem which is normalized at infinity , and whose jump matrices are uniformly close to the identity as @xmath91 . in this paper",
    "there are four transformations @xmath93 .",
    "a main role is played by the riemann surface ( [ pastur2 ] ) and certain @xmath94-functions defined on it .",
    "these are introduced in the next section , and they are used in section 3 to define the first transformation @xmath95 .",
    "this transformation has the effect of normalizing the rh problem at infinity , and in addition of producing `` good '' jump matrices that are amenable to subsequent analysis .",
    "however , contrary to earlier works , some of the jump matrices for @xmath96 have entries that are exponentially growing as @xmath91 .",
    "these exponentially growing entries disappear after the second transformation @xmath97 in section 4 which involves the global opening of lenses .",
    "the remaining transformation follow the pattern of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and other works .",
    "the transformation @xmath98 in section 5 involves a local opening of lenses which turns the remaining oscillating entries into exponentially decaying ones .",
    "then a parametrix for @xmath99 is built in sections 6 and 7 . in section 6",
    "a model rh problem is solved which provides the parametrix for @xmath99 away from the branch points , and in section 7 local parametrices are built around each of the branch points with the aid of airy functions .",
    "using this parametrix we define the final transformation @xmath100 in section 8 .",
    "it leads to a rh problem for @xmath101 which is of the desired type : normalized at infinity and jump matrices tending to the identity as @xmath91 . then @xmath101 itself tends to the identity matrix as @xmath91 , which is then used in the final section 9 to prove the theorems [ maintheo1 ] and [ maintheo2 ]",
    "we start from the cubic equation ( [ pastur2 ] ) which we write now with the variable @xmath102 instead of @xmath103 @xmath104 it defines a riemann surface that will play a central role in the proof .",
    "the inverse mapping is given by the rational function @xmath105 there are four branch points @xmath59 , @xmath106 with @xmath107 , which can be found as the images of the critical points under the inverse mapping .",
    "the mapping ( [ mapping ] ) has three inverses , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , that behave near infinity as @xmath110 the sheet structure of the riemann surface is determined by the way we choose the analytical continuations of the @xmath111 s .",
