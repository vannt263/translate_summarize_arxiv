    "radio and x - ray radiation from solar flares have been used for many years to study energy release , plasma heating , and particle acceleration and transport .",
    "joint studies of radio and x - ray radiation are particularly powerful because they probe populations of electrons at different energies , ranging from hot thermal electrons to nonthermal electrons of tens of kev emitting at soft x - ray ( sxr ) and hard x - ray ( hxr ) wavelengths , and nonthermal electrons with energies ranging from hundreds of kev to several mev emitting @xmath1-rays and centimeter- and millimeter - wavelength radiation ( e.g. , takakura et al .",
    "1983 ; klein et al . 1986 ; bruggmann et al . 1994 ; ramaty et al .",
    "1994 , trottet et al .",
    "1998 , 2002 ) .",
    "flares are conveniently divided into two broad classes , impulsive ( or compact ) and gradual ( or extended ) flares ( pallavicini et al .",
    "1977 ) although more complex classification schemes have been proposed ( e.g. , bai & sturrock 1989 ) in response to more detailed and comprehensive observations .",
    "impulsive flares tend to occur in relatively high density , compact , coronal magnetic loops , and display a good correlation between the microwave and hxr emission ( kai et al .",
    "1985 , kosugi et al . 1988 ) .",
    "gradual events tend to occur in lower density , larger scale coronal loops , emitting for significantly longer times .",
    "they tend to be  microwave rich \" ( bai & dennis 1985 ) by a factor of @xmath2 compared to the microwave - hxr correlation of impulsive events ( kosugi et al .",
    "the spectral and temporal profiles of these two classes also follow a predictable evolution ( e.g. silva et al . 2000 ) .",
    "impulsive bursts show a soft - hard - soft spectral evolution in hard x - rays and a radio peak - frequency evolution that evolves from low to high , and often back to low ( melnikov et al .",
    "gradual bursts , in contrast , show a soft - hard - harder evolution in x - rays and a radio spectral peak that is often constant or slowly increasing in frequency with time .",
    "bursts that do not obey these general rules are often worthy of detailed study , especially when well observed , in order to test our understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms .",
    "the impulsive flare of 2001 october 24 at 23:10 ut is an example of such a burst , which was well observed by a broad suite of instrumentation operating at radio and x - ray wavelengths and therefore offers an opportunity to study a wide range of electron energies .",
    "the event stands out paradoxically as an extremely x - ray - poor impulsive flare , producing a moderately intense radio burst , yet very little euv , sxr , or hxr emission .",
    "it is similar in several respects to a radio burst studied by white et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , an event for which available radio data suggested that energy release occurred in a dense plasma ( @xmath3 @xmath4 ) .",
    "veronig & brown ( 2004 ) have identified a class of hxr sources that also occur in a relatively dense plasma ( @xmath5 @xmath4 ) . as we show here , the oct .",
    "24 event is another example of an event in which energy release occurs is a dense plasma .",
    "however , unlike the events studied by veronig & brown , the oct .",
    "24 event is highly impulsive ; and unlike the event discussed by white et al . , the oct .",
    "24 event shows significant radio spectral evolution .",
    "although the physical conditions and the evolution of the burst are unusual , we believe that the physical processes are not . the excellent observational coverage at radio and x - ray wavelengths provides us with the opportunity to address electron acceleration in a dense plasma environment in some detail .",
    "in particular , the excellent time - resolved radio spectroscopic data available from ovsa and the norp has allowed us to fit the data to a source model as a function of time and thereby deduce the time variation of source parameters .",
    "these , in turn , have yielded insights into the nature and consequences of energy release in a dense plasma .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  2 we present the radio , euv , and x - ray observations of the flare . in ",
    "3 we argue that the data may be understood in terms of fast electrons injected into a relatively cool , dense magnetic loop .",
    "we explicitly fit a time series of radio spectroscopic data to a simple model that embodies these assumptions using a nonlinear @xmath0 minimization scheme . the parametric trends to emerge",
    "show that the time series of spectra is well fit if the temperature of the ambient plasma increases in time .",
    "we discuss implications of the model fits for plasma heating , electron acceleration , and electron transport in  4 .",
    "we suggest that the lack of significant x - ray emission can be understood if the magnetic mirror ratio is large , thereby suppressing electron precipitation and reducing conduction at the foot points .",
    "the relatively high plasma density in the source renders it collisionally thick to electrons with energies of some 10s of kev .",
    "we argue that collisional heating yields the systematic plasma heating inferred from model fitting .",
    "furthermore , electrons are accelerated progressively to energies exceeding mev energies over over a time scale @xmath6 s. we suggest that stochastic processes may play a significant role in the acceleration and transport of electrons .",
    "we conclude in  5 .",
    "the flare on 2001 october 24 occurred in noaa active region 9672 at a heliocentric position of s18w13 from approximately 23:10 - 23:14 ut .",
    "ar 9672 was in a @xmath7 magnetic configuration and had produced m and x class soft x - ray flares in previous days . while the relatively strong radio event from ar9672 was noted by the noaa space environment center , it was incorrectly associated with an h@xmath8 subflare that occurred nearly concurrently , from 23:07 - 23:12 ut , in ar 9678 ( n06e33 ) .",
    "no h@xmath8 observations of ar 9672 are available at the precise time of the event .",
    "while no soft x - ray emission was noted by noaa / sec from either the h@xmath8 subflare in ar9678 or the radio burst in ar9672 , weak extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) , soft x - ray ( sxr ) , and hard x - ray ( hxr ) emissions were in fact detected from the flare in ar9672 by the _ transition region and coronal explorer _ ( trace ; handy et al .",
    "1999 ) , the _ yohkoh _ soft x - ray telescope ( sxt ) , and hard x - ray telescope ( hxt ) , respectively ( kosugi et al . 1992 ) , as was a weak sxr enhancement by the goes 10 satellite .",
    "the radio burst was well - observed in total intensity by the owens valley solar array ( ovsa ; gary & hurford 1994 ) , the nobeyama radio polarimeters ( norp ) , and by the nobeyama radioheliograph ( norh ; nakajima et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "1a provides an overview of selected x - ray and radio observations .",
    "the hxr and radio light curves show a simple , highly impulsive rise and exponential decay over a duration of approximately 4 min whereas the goes sxr bands decay to half their peak flux on a time scale @xmath6 min . the horizontal line at the top of fig .",
    "1a indicates the time range shown in fig .",
    ", the hxr light curve is shown with the norp frequencies .",
    "we now discuss the euv , x - ray , and radio observations in greater detail .",
    "to place the 2001 october 24 event in the broader context of events jointly observed in the radio and hxr bands , fig .",
    "2 shows a scatter plot of the 135 flares observed jointly by the norp at 17 ghz and the hxt l band during the lifetime of the _ yohkoh _ mission .",
    "analogous figures have compared the 17 ghz peak flux with the hxr counts from the hard x - ray spectrometer on board _ hinotori",
    "_ ( kai et al . 1985 ) and from the hxrbs experiment on board the _ solar maximum mission _ ( kosugi et al . 1988 ) .",
    "as in these previous examples , there is a clear correlation between the peak 17 ghz flux and the peak hxt l band count rate .",
    "the spearman ( rank ) correlation coefficient is 0.57 , and the two - sided significance of the correlation  i.e. , the probability that the correlation coefficient is larger than this value in the null hypothesis ",
    "is essentially zero , indicating the correlation is highly significant .",
    "the flare of 2001 october 24 has a peak flux of 425 sfu w m@xmath9 hz@xmath10 at 17 ghz .",
    "the regression curve implies that an hxt  l band count rate of more than 200 cts s@xmath11 sc@xmath11 is expected , yet a peak count rate of only 7 cts s@xmath11 sc@xmath11 is measured ( including a background of @xmath12 ct s@xmath11 sc@xmath11 ) .",
    "the flare is x - ray poor by a factor of @xmath13 relative to the regression curve .",
    "we use the term  x - ray poor \" rather than  microwave rich \" because , as noted in the introduction , the latter term is associated with gradual events showing excess microwave emission ( bai & dennis 1985 , cliver et al . 1986 , kosugi et al . 1988 ) .",
    "while the oct 24 event is very x - ray poor it was nevertheless detected by several instruments operating at euv and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "it was imaged by trace in the 171   band with a cadence of @xmath14  s and an angular resolution of @xmath15 .",
    "an image was obtained just prior to the impulsive rise at 23:10:46  ut and another was obtained at 23:11:26 ut ( fig  1b ) . a difference image formed from the latter image and one obtained at 23:10:05 ut reveals discrete kernels of emission ( fig .",
    "3a ) .    in soft x - rays",
    ", the goes 10 background level was approximately c2.3 and the enhancement above background was approximately b2 .",
    "the x - ray emission was too weak to trigger flare mode observing by the sxt .",
    "as a result , only one low - resolution ( 4.92 \" ) full - disk sxr image ( almg filter ) is available during this brief impulsive flare , at 23:11:46 ut ( fig  1b , fig .",
    "the _ yohkoh _ hxt typically observed flares in four photon energy bands ",
    "l ( 13.9 - 22.7 kev ) , m1 ( 22.7 - 32.7 kev ) , m2 ( 32.7 - 52.7 kev ) , and h ( 52.7 - 92.8 kev ) . in this case , however , the hxt flare mode was not triggered and counts were therefore recorded in l band only . the l band light curve ( fig .",
    "1 ) shows a simple impulsive spike with a maximum background - subtracted count rate of only 6 cts s@xmath11 sc@xmath11 and a fwhm duration of just 18 s. integrating over the full duration of the event yields sufficient counts to image the hxr source with an angular resolution of @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "the _ yohkoh _ wide - band spectrometer ( wbs ; yoshimori et al .",
    "1992 ) may have made a marginal detection in energy channels up to 50 kev ( h. hudson , private communication ) but given uncertainties in the calibration the implications for the hxr photon spectrum are highly uncertain .",
    "we therefore do not consider wbs data here .",
    "each of the maps shown in fig .  3 is compared with a magnetogram .",
    "the flare is associated with a magnetic bipole just south of the dominant sunspot group in ar 9672 .",
    "the length of the source is @xmath17 in sxr and its width is @xmath18 .",
    "the sxr and hxr sources are coincident ( cf .",
    "veronig & brown 2004 ) and are consistent with a magnetic loop or unresolved loops , the latter suggested by the discrete kernels seen in the trace 171 emissions , presumed here to be footpoint emission .",
    "radio imaging observations of the flare were obtained by the norh at 17 and 34 ghz .",
    "the norh observations were made early in the day , local time , and the angular resolution was therefore reduced in one dimension , yielding an elliptical beam of approximately @xmath19 at 17 ghz , and @xmath20 at 34 ghz , both with a position angle @xmath21 .",
    "4a and 4c show the 17 and 34 ghz maps in total intensity ( stokes i ) overlaid on the magnetogram .",
    "the source morphology evolves very little at radio wavelengths as a function of time ; we therefore show maps near the time of maximum intensity .",
    "the peak brightness temperature of the 17 ghz source is @xmath22 k whereas that of the 34 ghz source is @xmath23 k. fig .",
    "4b shows the 17 ghz map of the circularly polarized flux ( stokes v parameter ) superposed on the magnetogram , demonstrating that it is polarized in the sense of the x - mode with right - circularly polarized emission associated with positive magnetic polarity .",
    "the degree of circular polarization",
    "( i / v ) ranges from 20% left - circularly polarized ( lcp ; negative values of stokes",
    "v ) to 10% right - circularly polarized ( rcp ; positive values of stokes v ) . the observed change in the sense of circular polarization along the length of the loop from rcp to lcp reflects the reversal of magnetic polarity while the asymmetry in the degree of rcp / lcp polarization indicates an asymmetry in the magnitude of the positive and negative magnetic polarity .",
    "the sources observed in the sxr , hxr , and radio bands are coincident and quite similar in morphology .",
    "all imaging data are consistent with the illumination of a simple magnetic loop , or unresolved bundle of loops , straddling a magnetic neutral line .",
    "we note that the loop is not visible in the norh 17 and 34 ghz maps as a discrete feature in the active region prior to the flare .",
    "we estimate the 17 ghz brightness temperature prior to the flare is @xmath24 k.    the norp measures the total solar flux in stokes i and v at frequencies @xmath25 , 2 , 3.75 , 9.4 , 17 , 35 , and 80 ghz .",
    "referring to the norp observations summarized in fig .  1b , we note several features .",
    "first , the onset of the 35 ghz emission is delayed by @xmath26 s relative to that at 17 ghz which is , in turn , delayed by @xmath26 s relative to the onset of the hxt l band emission .",
    "second , the time of the 17 ghz flux maximum is delayed by @xmath26 s relative to that at 35 ghz and the maximum of the 9.4 ghz light curve is delayed by 12 s relative to that at 17 ghz .",
    "note , however , that a  shoulder \" in the 9.4 ghz emission roughly coincides with the 17 and 35 ghz maxima , a point discussed further in  4 .",
    "third , the decay profiles of the 9.4 , 17 , and 35 ghz light curves are nearly identical and are exponential after approximately 23:11:20 ut with a decay time of @xmath27 s. fourth , there is no detectable radio emission at 3.75 ghz .",
    "finally , while the flare was detected at 80 ghz the signal is very noisy ( 4 - 5@xmath28 ) .",
    "we note that both the sensitivity and the calibration of the 80 ghz flux on this date are rather poor , the absolute flux calibration being no better than @xmath29 ( h. nakajima , private communication ) .",
    "these features are confirmed and extended by the ovsa observations . on 2001",
    "october 24 , ovsa employed a high cadence observing mode to produce 24 point spectra between 1.2 - 14.8 ghz every 2 s in total intensity .",
    "a detail of the impulsive onset of the flare is shown in fig .",
    "5a which plots the hxt l band data , three ovsa frequencies ( 11.2 , 12.4 , and 14.8 ghz , labeled with a prefix  o \" ) , and three norp frequencies ( 9.4 , 17 , and 35 ghz , labeled with a prefix  n \" ) for a period of 20  s. the frequencies 12.4 , 14.8 , 17 , and 35 ghz show a progressive delay in their flux onset relative to the hxt l band emission .",
    "the onset of emission at 9.4 and 11.2 ghz show the opposite pattern , however .",
    "these trends are also clearly seen in the dynamic spectrum of the ovsa data ( fig .",
    "6 ) . for frequencies",
    "@xmath30 ghz the flux onset is increasingly delayed with frequency whereas the opposite trend is seen for @xmath31 ghz .",
    "5b shows a detail of the decay phase for the same selection of frequencies shown in fig .",
    "each frequency has been scaled so that for times later than 23:11:20  ut the light curves are overlaid , showing that the exponential decay from 9.4 to 35 ghz is essentially identical after 23:11:20  ut . fig .",
    "5b also illustrates the progressive delay of the flux maximum with decreasing frequency .",
    "this feature is more clearly illustrated in fig .",
    "6 , in which it is readily seen ( dashed line ) that the time of the flux maximum increases with decreasing frequency .",
    "there is no detectable emission below @xmath32 ghz .",
    "the radio spectral evolution of the flare is summarized in fig .  7 , which shows composite spectra using ovsa data ( plus symbols ) and norp data ( diamonds ) during the impulsive rise and exponential decay .",
    "the spectral maximum is near 17 ghz during the rise phase but declines to @xmath33 ghz during the decay phase .",
    "given the rather extensive data set it is useful to consolidate and summarize our findings regarding the flare on 2001 october 24 :    * the flare is one of the most x - ray poor events of those jointly observed by the norp and _ yohkoh _ hxt . * the norh 17 and 34 ghz images , and the _ yohkoh _ sxt and hxt",
    "l band images are all coincident and similar in morphology .",
    "the source is consistent with a simple magnetic loop or unresolved bundle of loops .",
    "the trace 171   difference image reveals small kernels consistent with loop foot points .",
    "* due to the paucity of x - rays , the photon spectrum was not measured and the electron spectrum is therefore unconstrained by hxr emission .",
    "* the observed radio emission is relatively strong and the spectral coverage is excellent , allowing the following observations to be made : * * radio emission is detected up to 80 ghz .",
    "the spectral maximum is @xmath34 ghz during the impulsive rise , declining to @xmath33 ghz during its decay .",
    "radio emission is undetectable below @xmath32 ghz . * * the impulsive onset of emission shows a progressive delay with _ increasing _",
    "frequency for @xmath35 ghz ; the trend reverses below @xmath36 ghz . * * in contrast , the time of absolute flux maximum shows a progressive delay with _ decreasing _",
    "frequency for all frequencies measured . * * for times later than approximately 23:11:20  ut the decay profile of the radio emission is independent of frequency over two octaves and is characterized by a decay time of @xmath37 s.    despite the relatively simple source morphology in the x - ray and radio bands , and the single impulsive spike shown in the hxr and radio light curves , this event displays considerable spectral richness at radio wavelengths . in the next section we develop a source model and perform parametric fits to the time series of radio spectra .",
    "the parametric trends to emerge from these fits then guide our physical interpretation of the event in  4 .",
    "we now direct our attention to the well - observed radio source and fit a simple model to the radio data as a function of time .",
    "a fully self - consistent , three dimensional , time - dependent , inhomogeneous model of the source is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we instead account for the essential features of the source in terms of a magnetized volume containing thermal plasma and energetic electrons .",
    "similar models have been developed to account for the spectral ( e.g. , klein 1987 ; benka & holman 1992 ; bruggmann et al .",
    "1994 ) , temporal ( e.g. , bruggmann et al . 1994 ) , or spatial ( bastian et al . 1998 ; nindos et al . 2000 ; kundu et al .",
    "2004 ) properties of radio observations . typically , these efforts have been strongly under - constrained in the temporal , spatial , and/or spectral domains . moreover",
    ", model fitting has typically been limited to adjusting model parameters until a reasonable fit by eye is obtained .    in the present case , we have comparatively good spectral and temporal coverage of the event at radio wavelengths . while imaging data are limited , the source is apparently rather simple .",
    "it is therefore possible to make simplifying assumptions regarding the source volume and to exploit nonlinear optimization techniques to fit the observed radio spectrum .",
    "moreover , such fits can be performed on the time series of spectra , from which the time variation of fitted parameters can be deduced . as such , the fitting represents a means of time - resolved radio - spectral inversion .",
    "while the model is admittedly crude , it nevertheless allows us to identify trends in the time variation of critical parameters in an unbiased fashion . in other words , rather than postulating a time dependence for physical parameters of interest , the time dependence emerges from the model fits . in this section we describe the model and the underlying assumptions , explore the parametric dependencies of the model , and then present the fitting scheme and the results derived from the fits in detail .",
    "we assume the observed radio emission is the result of gyrosynchrotron radiation from energetic electrons in a magnetic loop .",
    "a striking feature of the radio spectra is the relatively steep roll - off in the emission below @xmath38 ghz , with no emission detectable at all below @xmath39 ghz , a feature that persists for the duration of the event .",
    "the spectrum of the radio emission is clearly nonthermal , yet the brightness temperature of the 17 and 34 ghz sources is unexceptional , characteristic of optically thin emission .",
    "we therefore suggest that the razin effect ( razin 1960 , ginzburg & syrovatskii 1969 ) plays a role in this flare .",
    "the razin effect suppresses gyrosynchrotron emission in the presence of an ambient plasma below a cutoff frequency @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the thermal electron density and @xmath42 is the source magnetic field . for @xmath43 ghz and and an ambient density @xmath44 @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath45 g. for a given cutoff frequency @xmath46 , higher magnetic field strengths require higher thermal electron densities .",
    "the thermal free - free absorption coefficient at radio wavelengths is @xmath47 for coronal conditions ( dulk 1985 ) .",
    "the optical depth @xmath48 through a plasma layer @xmath49 is @xmath50 . substituting plausible values for the relevant parameters ",
    "@xmath51 k , @xmath52 cm , and @xmath53 @xmath4  we find that @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the frequency in ghz .",
    "the optical depth is even larger for cooler plasma .",
    "it is clear that if razin suppression is important , free - free absorption is , too .",
    "consequently , we assume that razin suppression and free - free absorption each play a role in determining the shape of the radio spectrum and include both in our model calculations ( cf .",
    "ramaty & petrosian 1972 , klein 1987 ) .",
    "as previously noted , the source morphology changes little during the event .",
    "we therefore consider a homogeneous source with an area @xmath56 @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) and a depth @xmath59 cm ( 12 \" ) , consistent with the x - ray and radio imaging ( see  2.4 ) .",
    "the source volume is assumed to contain thermal plasma with a density @xmath41 and a temperature @xmath60 , permeated by a coronal magnetic field @xmath42 with an angle @xmath61 relative to the line of sight .",
    "finally , it is assumed that an isotropic , power - law distribution of energetic electrons @xmath62 is uniformly mixed with the thermal plasma , with a normalization energy @xmath63 and a high - energy cutoff energy @xmath64 .",
    "the total number density of nonthermal electrons between @xmath63 and @xmath64 is @xmath65 .",
    "no electron transport effects are explicitly included in the model calculation .",
    "the computation of radio emission from even as simple a source model as this depends on many parameters . to make further progress , additional assumptions are necessary .",
    "first , we assume the magnetic field remains constant for the duration of the event .",
    "however , as a means of estimating the dependence of the fitted parameters on the magnetic field , different values of the magnetic field were assumed for different fitting runs .",
    "second we assume the number density of the background thermal plasma also remains constant . in fact , as discussed further in  3.3 , preliminary fits allowed @xmath41 to vary but the fitted values showed little variation with time .",
    "hence , it was typically held fixed .",
    "an additional justification for this second assumption is that , given the weak euv and hxr emission , there was little deposition of energy near the loop footpoints and hence , little evaporation of plasma into the coronal loop .",
    "the incremental increase in density due to evaporation is therefore presumed to be small .",
    "we do allow the temperature of the thermal background plasma to vary with time , however .",
    "finally , we note that the radio emission is insensitive to @xmath63 and therefore set it equal to 100 kev .",
    "to summarize , we model the radio source as a simple homogenous volume with an area @xmath66 and a depth @xmath49 .",
    "the volume is filled with a thermal plasma with a number density @xmath41 and is permeated by a magnetic field @xmath42 oriented at an angle @xmath61 to the line of sight ; @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath61 are assumed to be constant during the flare but the plasma temperature is allowed to vary . a power - law distribution of @xmath65 energetic electrons per cubic centimeter between energies @xmath67 and @xmath64 is uniformly mixed with the background plasma .",
    "the electron pitch angle distribution is assumed to be isotropic .",
    "typically two or three out of four parameters ",
    "@xmath65 , @xmath60 , @xmath64 , and @xmath68  were allowed to vary in fitting the data to the model .",
    "it is useful to make a brief aside at this point to outline the computation of the radio emission spectrum and to elucidate the dependencies of the computed spectrum on various parameters of interest . for the homogeneous source described above",
    ", the source flux at a given frequency is computed as ( ramaty & petrosian 1972 ; benka & holman 1992 )    @xmath69\\ ] ]    where @xmath70 is the index of refraction , @xmath71 is the total emissivity due to the free - free and gyrosynchrotron mechanisms , @xmath72 is the total absorption coefficient , @xmath73 is the solid angle subtended by the source , and @xmath74 is the distance from the observer to the source ( 1 au ) .",
    "the thermal free - free emission and absorption coefficients used for the computation of the source function are readily calculated ( e.g. , lang 1980 ) ; those for gyrosynchrotron emission and absorption are more problematic .",
    "the expressions for the emissivity and absorption coefficient given by ramaty ( 1969 ) , or variants thereof ( e.g. , benka & holman 1992 ) , are cumbersome and their calculation is computationally intensive . for the iterative @xmath0 minimization scheme we employ , it is far more efficient to use the approximate expressions derived by klein ( 1987 ) which include the effects of razin suppression and are quite accurate for radio frequencies greater than the first few harmonics of the electron gyrofrequency ( @xmath75 ) and for values of @xmath61 that are not too small ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "8 shows model spectra calculated for various sets of parameters .",
    "all four panels show a reference spectrum ( solid line ) due to gyrosynchrotron emission from electrons _ in vacuo _",
    "( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the parameters used for the reference spectrum are : @xmath78 g , @xmath79 , @xmath80 @xmath4 , @xmath81 kev , @xmath82 mev , @xmath83 , @xmath56 @xmath84 , and @xmath85 cm . in fig .",
    "8a the dashed lines indicate spectra where the source parameters are identical to those used to compute the reference spectrum except that an ambient thermal plasma is present in the source .",
    "the ambient plasma has a temperature of @xmath86 k and its density varies from @xmath87 @xmath4 to @xmath88 @xmath4 .",
    "the combined action of free - free absorption and razin suppression strongly reduces the radio emission below 10 - 20 ghz for values of @xmath89 @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , as the density increases , the high - frequency emission is enhanced .",
    "this enhancement is entirely due to the thermal free - free contribution .    in fig .",
    "8b , the temperature is again @xmath51 k and the ambient density is held fixed at @xmath53 @xmath4 . here , the magnetic field strength is allowed to vary from @xmath78 to 350 g. all other source parameters are identical to those used to compute the reference spectrum .",

    "the plasma becomes optically thin to free - free absorption ( @xmath92 k in this example ) and the spectrum becomes insensitive to further increases in temperature except the extreme low - frequency end of the of the spectrum where the emission is due to optically thick thermal radiation of the plasma and is proportional to its temperature .    finally , in fig .",

    "while the source model is relatively simple , it yields a wide variety of spectral shapes which , in turn , yield insight to the source parameters .",
    "we now turn to fitting this simple source model to the observed data .",
    "the excellent radio spectroscopic and temporal coverage of this event allow us to fit the observed radio spectra as a function of time .",
    "lee & gary ( 2000 ) used a similar approach to fit an electron transport model to ovsa data although a different `` goodness of fit '' parameter was optimized . here , we have developed a nonlinear code that adjusts model parameters to minimize the @xmath0 statistic using the downhill simplex method ( press et al .",
    "the @xmath0 statistic is computed as    @xmath94    where @xmath95 is the flux density at frequency @xmath96 observed by either ovsa or the norp , @xmath97 is the corresponding model value , @xmath98 is the estimated variance of the observed value , @xmath99 is the number of data points , and @xmath100 is the number of free parameters .",
    "the signal variance @xmath98 at each frequency is empirically known prior to the flare .",
    "it is the result of receiver noise , the sky ( 35 and 80 ghz ) , and the sun itself .",
    "radio emission from the flare makes an additional contribution that can be estimated from the known intensity of the signals and the properties of the instrument .",
    "we have fit the model to composite radio spectra observed by ovsa ( 5 - 14.8 ghz ) and the norp ( 17 , 35 , and 80 ghz ) .",
    "data points below 5 ghz are ignored because they contain no signal .",
    "inspection of the spectra indicates a probable systematic calibration error between the two instruments with a magnitude of @xmath101 ( fig .",

    "a total of 25 spectra were fit to data sampled between 23:10:54 and 23:11:44 ut , as indicated in fig .",
    "the spectra at earlier and later times had insufficient signal - to - noise ratios at too many points to yield reliable fits .",
    "while the spectral coverage of this event at radio frequencies is excellent , it is nevertheless insufficient to allow unique sets of parameters to be established from fits to the data .",
    "excluding frequencies below 5 ghz , we fit to only sixteen data points for each time average .",
    "indeed , as explained in  3.1 , many of the source parameters are held constant and only two or three out of four parameters were varied .",
    "clearly , the models resulting from this procedure , while providing good fits to the data , are non - unique .",
    "we set those parameters that remain constant for all fits to values we judge to be reasonable , but are fully aware that other , similar , values may in fact yield fits that are consistent with the data .",
    "we therefore consider the fits and the trends that emerge from the time series of fitted parameters to be qualitative guides in our physical interpretation of the flare in  4 .",
    "9 shows the results of two- and three - parameter fits to the 25 spectra observed from 23:10:54 to 23:11:44 ut . in the two - parameter fit ( solid line ) , only the number of fast electrons , @xmath65 , and the plasma temperature , @xmath60 , were allowed to vary and the spectral index and cutoff energy were held fixed , with @xmath102 and @xmath82 mev , respectively , as were all other relevant parameters : @xmath103 g , @xmath79 , @xmath81 kev , @xmath56 @xmath84 , and @xmath85 cm .",
    "the value for the spectral index is entirely consistent with previous findings ( e.g. , ramaty et al .",

    "three parameter fits are also shown , the third parameter being either @xmath68 ( dashed line ) or @xmath64 ( dotted line ) .",
    "as discussed in  3.1 , little improvement was seen in the ( three - parameter ) fits when the thermal plasma density , @xmath41 was free to vary .",
    "the fitted value of @xmath41 remained nearly constant ( @xmath104 @xmath4 ) in all cases and was therefore held fixed at this value for the fits shown in fig .",
    "when @xmath68 was allowed to vary it , too , remained relatively constant or in some cases showed a tendency to smaller values ; i.e. , spectral hardening . when @xmath64 was allowed to vary , best fit values during the rise phase of the flare yielded @xmath105 mev whereas for times later than approximately 23:11:12 ut , larger values of @xmath64 resulted ( @xmath106 ) mev .",
    "we note that the fits become insensitive to the precise value of @xmath64 when it exceeds @xmath33 mev because the high frequency radio data most sensitive to @xmath64 are sparse and , in the case of 80 ghz , poorly calibrated .",
    "10 shows a comparison between the fitted values for @xmath65 and @xmath60 resulting from the two - parameter fits and the radio and hxr emission as a function of time .",

    "the shaded area in each panel indicates the range of fitted values that result from varying the magnetic field strength .",
    "the time variation of @xmath65 and @xmath60 are shown for three fixed values of the magnetic field ( 150 , 165 , and 180 g ) .",
    "two points can be made about the apparent trends : first , the total number of energetic electrons tracks the variation of the high frequency ( 35  ghz ) radio emission for the interval that was fit quite well , as expected for optically thin emission .",
    "second , the temperature of the ambient plasma increases with time . with @xmath103 g , @xmath60 increases from @xmath107 k to @xmath108 k during the time range considered .",
    "both @xmath60 and @xmath65 depend on @xmath42 : the fitted value of @xmath65 decreases and that of @xmath60 increases with increasing @xmath42 . referring to fig .",
    "8c , we note that the fits are relatively insensitive to plasma temperature once @xmath60 approaches @xmath109 k ( fig .",
    "10b ) because the optical depth to free - free absorption becomes negligible .",
    "we find no evidence that the observed spectral evolution requires multiple discrete injections of electrons characterized by different energy distribution functions , as suggested by , e.g. , trottet et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , for certain events .",
    "we checked the fitted temperature and the emission measure implied by the assumed density ( i.e. , @xmath110 ) against the goes sxr observations for consistency ( white et al .",
    "a peak temperature near @xmath109 k is consistent with the goes 0.5 - 4 and 1 - 8   data but the density inferred from the goes data is perhaps a factor of two smaller than that assumed here . given that the goes event is very small and the uncertainties in the sxr background are relatively large , and given that the parametric fits depend on a number of assumptions , we conclude that the consistency between the fits and the sxr data is rather good .",
    "the  standard model \" of flares involves energy deposition in the chromosphere by a flux of nonthermal electrons precipitating from one or more magnetic loops , resulting in heating and  evaporation \" of chromospheric plasma into the corona where it emits sxr radiation .",
    "we suggest that a difference between this flare and the  standard model \" is that significant chromospheric evaporation did not occur .",
    "as noted in the previous section , the spectral fits do not require an increase in the thermal plasma density during the course of the flare .",
    "furthermore , there is a paucity of euv and sxr emission from hot thermal plasma , suggesting little increase in emission measure of coronal plasma and hence , little increase in the thermal plasma density .",
    "why is there so little chromospheric evaporation ?",
    "one reason may be that the flaring loop has a large ( albeit asymmetric ) magnetic mirror ratio , defined as @xmath111 , the ratio of the magnetic field strength near the magnetic footpoint to that at the loop top where the magnetic field is weakest , and @xmath112 is the loss - cone angle .",
    "a large value of @xmath113 implies a small value for @xmath112 , little precipitation of energetic electrons from the loop and hence , little euv and hxr footpoint emission .",
    "for example , a mirror ratio @xmath114 implies only @xmath115 of an isotropic particle distribution would precipitate from the magnetic loop if magnetic trapping and weak scattering were the only relevant transport processes ( e.g. , melrose & brown 1976 ) .",
    "a second factor is that the coronal loop , with @xmath53 @xmath4 , is collisionally thick to electrons with energies @xmath116 kev ( veronig & brown 2004 ) .",
    "such electrons would deposit the bulk of their energy in the ambient plasma rather than at the loop footpoints .",
    "one might suppose that if the precipitation of energetic electrons into the footpoints is limited , thermal conduction might nevertheless drive evaporation . however , if the mirror ratio is large the footpoint area is small and evaporation due to conduction can also be strongly reduced .",
    "these considerations are consistent with the observed morphology of the hxt l band source shown in fig .",
    "the idea of a large mirror ratio stands in contradiction to our simple model , for which a magnetically homogeneous source was assumed .",
    "this may not be a concern , however , if the magnetic loop is strongly convergent near the chromosphere ( dowdy et al . 1985 ) .",
    "the time interval during which plasma heating is observed via spectral fitting is from 23:10:50 to 23:11:20 ut , so that @xmath117 s. during this time , the data suggest the temperature of the ambient thermal plasma in the flaring source increased from 2 - 3 mk to 8 - 10 mk .",
    "we note that the source was presumably already heated from @xmath118 mk to 2 - 3 mk prior to the time range for which fits were computed . whether @xmath60 continued to increase significantly beyond 23:11:20 ut is not established because the model fitting becomes insensitive to temperature when @xmath119 k although the goes sxr emission suggest that it did not . since both the radiative and conductive loss times",
    "are long compared to the duration of the flare , the net change of thermal energy density during the observed temperature increase is @xmath120 ergs @xmath4 , yielding a mean energy deposition rate of @xmath121 ergs s@xmath11 @xmath4 . the magnetic energy density @xmath122 erg @xmath4 .",
    "hence , the energy deposition rate required to heat the plasma amounts to @xmath123 of @xmath124 each second and a total energy deposition of @xmath125 ergs .    what heats the plasma ?",
    "one possibility , to which we have already alluded , is energy loss via coulomb collisions . by virtue of its high density",
    "the coronal loop is collisionally thick to electrons with energies @xmath126 kev .",
    "unfortunately , no hxr observations of photon energies greater than the hxt l band are available because the flare did not trigger the _ yohkoh _ flare mode .",
    "the spectral index and low - energy cutoff of the distribution of hxr - emitting electrons are unknown and hence , the number of electrons with energies of 10s of kev , can not be inferred from the hxr observations . it may even be possible that thermal bremsstrahlung contributes to the hxt l band counts .",
    "however , if we suppose the mean energy of the hxr - emitting electrons is @xmath127 kev , then @xmath128 such electrons are needed each second to account for the plasma heating via collisions .",
    "we now consider the radio - emitting electrons .",
    "the peak number density of energetic electrons with energies @xmath129 kev was found to be @xmath130 @xmath4 .",
    "note that while @xmath65 is normalized to @xmath81 kev , for @xmath103 g the bulk of the emission at radio frequencies between @xmath131 ghz is in fact contributed by electrons with energies of @xmath132 mev , a result that has been previously noted ( ramaty et al .",
    "1994 , trottet et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ; lthi et al 2004 ) .",
    "the energy contained in these electrons is only @xmath133 ergs @xmath4 , an insignificant fraction of that required to heat the ambient plasma .",
    "we conclude that the radio - emitting electrons themselves play no role in heating the plasma ; but what if the power - law distribution of radio - emitting electrons extends to lower energies ?",
    "the collisional energy deposition rate is    @xmath134    with    @xmath135    where the approximate expression for the lifetime @xmath136 applies to mildly relativistic electrons ( melrose & brown 1976 ) . here",
    ", @xmath137 is the lorentz factor , @xmath138 , @xmath139 is the electron energy in units of 100 kev , and @xmath140 is the thermal plasma density in units of @xmath141 @xmath4 . taking @xmath102 (  3 )",
    "we find @xmath142 kev yields an energy deposition rate of 10 ergs @xmath4 s@xmath11 , in agreement with the mean energy deposition rate , and the total number of electrons @xmath143 kev is found to be @xmath144 @xmath4 s@xmath11 .",
    "the inferred electron energy and number density are similar to those needed to account for plasma heating by coulomb collisions .",
    "we conclude that the population of electrons responsible for the hxt l band emission and plasma heating can be regarded as part of the same power - law distribution of electrons responsible for the radio emission .",
    "while this picture is appealing , it is incomplete .",
    "thus far we have based our discussion on the results of the two - parameter ( @xmath145 ) fits to the time series of radio spectroscopic data for which the electron energy distribution is assumed to be a power - law described by fixed values of @xmath67 , @xmath64 , and @xmath68 . while there are hints in the three - parameter fits of possible evolution of @xmath68 and/or @xmath64 , such variations did not yield significantly better fits during the time interval considered . in ",
    "2.3 , however , we considered the impulsive onset of the event and found that onset time progressively increased with frequency for @xmath146 ghz ( fig .",
    "5a ) . the mean energy of the emitting electrons @xmath147 ( dulk 1985 ) ;",
    "hence , higher radio frequencies are emitted by higher energy electrons for a fixed magnetic field .",
    "the progressive delay in the onset of impulsive emission for @xmath35 ghz suggests that the more energetic the electrons , the later they appeared in the source .",
    "the onset times of emission for @xmath148 ghz may at first seem inconsistent with the trend seen at higher frequencies .",
    "however , they can be understood in terms of the overall pattern of strong free - free absorption diminishing with time as the plasma temperature increases .",
    "consider 9.4 ghz : at the time of flux onset the 9.4 ghz flux is strongly reduced by free - free absorption and razin suppression . as the plasma heats the free - free opacity declines and the gyrosynchrotron emission increases .",
    "the triangle at 23:11:02 ut in fig .",
    "1b , and the dotted line in fig .  7 , indicates the time of the 35 ghz flux maximum . in fig .",
    "1b it clearly coincides with the `` shoulder '' seen in the 9.4 ghz light curve , a feature that roughly coincides with the maximum of @xmath65 .",
    "it is not until the plasma heats still further that the free - free opacity becomes negligible at 9.4 ghz and the flux maximum is achieved , well after the maximum of @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , despite the complicating factor of free - free absorption , we conclude that the timing delays seen in the onset of the radio emission relative to the hxt l band , and from lower to higher frequencies , are consistent with progressive acceleration of electrons with time during the impulsive rise . the net time elapsed from the acceleration of electrons with energies of 10s of kev to those with energies of 100s of kev is @xmath149 s , and from 100s of kev to mev energies is @xmath150 s ( fig .",
    "after the initial energization to mev energies , there does not appear to be any further significant evolution of the form electron energy spectrum , as determined by spectral fitting .",
    "we return to this point below .    finally , we consider the observed frequency independence of the decay of the radio emission of this event , a feature shared with the flare described by white et al .",
    "this feature is clearly at odds with flare transport models in which the weak diffusion regime and magnetic trapping play a significant role ( e.g. , bruggmann et al .",
    "1994 ; bastian et al . 1998",
    "; lee et al .",
    "2000 ; kundu et al .",
    "if weak diffusion and trapping were relevant , higher energy electrons would be lost from the distribution more slowly than lower energy electrons because the collision frequency @xmath151 and the energy loss rate decrease with energy according to equation ( [ edot ] ) .",
    "consequently , higher frequency radio emission would decay more slowly than lower frequency emission ( see kundu et al .",
    "2001 for a vivid example ) .",
    "yet , the radio decay profiles for the oct 24 event are essentially identical ( fig .",
    "5b ) ; they are exponential with a decay time of 48  s for all frequencies with detectable emission for times later than approximately 23:11:20 ut .",
    "we conclude that while coulomb collisions play a dominant role in the energy loss of hxr - emitting electrons ( 10s of kev ) , they do not appear to play a role in the transport of the mev radio - emitting electrons . instead",
    ", wave - particle interactions mediate electron transport .",
    "to summarize our findings , electron acceleration occurs during the impulsive rise phase of the flare , progressing from energies of 10s of kev to more than an mev in @xmath152 s. there is no compelling evidence for further significant evolution of the electron spectrum during the remainder of the flare based on model fitting .",
    "the flare plasma is collisionally thick to electrons with energies of some 10s of kev ; these electrons heat the plasma .",
    "the increase in plasma temperature leads to a frequency - dependent decrease in free - free opacity , thereby explaining the increasing delay of the radio flux maximum with decreasing frequency .",
