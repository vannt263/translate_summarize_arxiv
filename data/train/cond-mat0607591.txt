    "oscillatory zoning ( oz ) is a phenomenon describing repetitive composition variations of binary solid solutions along their core - to - rim profile .",
    "traditionally , it was believed to be of rare occurrence and its existence was ascribed to variations of external parameters controlling the crystal growth , like temperature or concentration fluctuations . however , the development of more sophisticated observation techniques facilitated the detection of this phenomenon in all major classes of minerals and a wide range of geological environments @xcite .",
    "in addition to naturally obtained samples oz was experimentally reproduced in the absence of external fluctuations .",
    "_ @xcite were able to grow calcite crystals exhibiting oz of the mg dopant and putnis _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained end - member zoning in ( ba , sr)so@xmath0 crystals .    the experimental setup used by putnis _",
    "@xcite is sketched in fig .",
    "[ expputnis ] .",
    "it consists of two reservoirs , one filled with an aqueous solution of bacl@xmath1/srcl@xmath1 and the other with na@xmath1so@xmath0 .",
    "the two reservoirs are connected by a column filled with a silica - gel to inhibit convective transport . with the beginning of the experiment",
    "the reactants from the reservoirs start to diffuse toward each other through the column . as the diffusion fields of ba@xmath2 and sr@xmath2 from one reservoir and so@xmath3 from the other reservoir exceed the nucleation threshold product in the vicinity of the column center , nuclei form .",
    "the solution is then strongly supersaturated with respect to the freshly generated crystal seeds and the growth commences in a layer of few millimeters in width @xcite . after approximately one month",
    "the experiment was terminated .",
    "the obtained crystals exhibited oz although no external fluctuations were imposed on the system .",
    "thus it has been clearly shown that oz can be also attributed to intrinsic mechanisms resulting in spontaneous structure formation @xcite .",
    "the wide range of different crystals concerned suggests a certain universality of the underlying mechanism .     experimental setup in which oscillatory zoned crystals of ( ba ,",
    "sr)so@xmath0 were synthesized in refs .",
    "the reactants counterdiffuse in the column and ( ba , sr)so@xmath0 crystals nucleate .",
    "the upper window sketches the structure of the nucleation zone and the length scales involved . ]    the general principle causing oz is the autocatalytic or inhibiting interaction of the substrate with the end member concentration in melt or solution @xcite .",
    "if , for example , the crystal is rich in component a , this will lead to increased growth of this component in an autocatalytic way .",
    "its supply will eventually be limited by diffusion . during this phase the disfavored component b will accumulate in the solution , leading to a slight increase of b deposition .",
    "however , any small increase in b will show autocatalytic effects , whereas the growth of a slowly decreases .",
    "the combination of a relatively high b concentration in combination with the autocatalytically increasing growth rate will then lead to a phase of b dominated growth . with this , a and b have switched roles and one half cycle is completed . if the interaction of those two processes is interrupted , for example by stirring no oz will be observed @xcite .",
    "the specific interaction of autocatalytic growth and component accumulation is subject to the scenario employed and gives rise to different nonlinear schemes . the first quantitative model derived by haase _",
    "@xcite describes self - organized oscillatory zoning from the melt applying moving boundaries and a generically autocatalytic growth term . in a subsequent series of publications wang and merino introduced the boundary layer approximation for the treatment of zoned crystals grown hydrothermally @xcite , from solution @xcite , and from melt @xcite .",
    "later , non generic growth terms derived from the physics of growth processes from the melt were introduced by lheureux @xcite using constitutional undercooling and by wang and wu @xcite employing the excess enthalpy of crystallization .",
    "the most sophisticated models currently available for end member oz from solution have been developed by lheureux _",
    "these models apply the boundary layer approximation , as well , and in addition to the otherwise deterministic nature the influence of noise on the onset of oz is studied .",
    "the non - linear growth term applied is phenomenologically obtained from the local probability to find a matching kink site as proposed by markov @xcite .",
    "however , the local nature of this mechanism does not provide the synchronization effects necessary to describe homogeneous growth fronts resulting in the ring like composition oscillations found in the experiment @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a boundary reaction diffusion model for oz in binary solid solutions grown from aqueous solution .",
    "we abandon the boundary layer approximation and explicitly treat the diffusion above the crystal without further approximations .",
    "furthermore , the growth rate , being the central ingredient of every model , is derived directly from considerations of the physical growth mechanisms .",
    "we apply the concept of layer - by - layer growth under continuous generation of new steps which is , e.g. , relevant for growth by screw dislocations or 2d nucleation .",
    "the growth mechanism results as an interplay of different processes including bulk diffusion , adsorption , surface diffusion , and eventually desorption or incorporation into the crystal .",
    "the non - linearity necessary to generate oz is obtained by the composition - dependence of the mean life time of adatoms in the adsorbed layer or , equivalently , the interaction of adatoms with the crystal surface .    in sect .",
    "ii the different aspects of the model are introduced .",
    "the resulting model equations are summarized in sect .",
    "iii . then , sect .",
    "iv analyses this model close to the stationary point .",
    "v presents its numerical analysis , including all nonlinear effects .",
    "finally , the obtained results are discussed in sect .",
    "vi and concluded in sect . vii .",
    "the model under consideration describes the diffusion processes in the bulk solution , the growth process following from the coupling between crystal and solution , and the evolution of the crystal composition .",
    "based on the slow crystal growth observed in the experiments @xcite , we apply screw dislocations as the step generating mechanism and describe the subsequent growth process via step advance . screw dislocation driven growth can cross over to two dimensional nucleation , as shown by pina _",
    "et al . _",
    ". however , this will not affect the validity of the model because the specific process of step generation is not of immediate importance .",
    "we assume that after nucleation the crystal surface will reach a steady - state when the density of the step generating islands or spirals does not change any more , because of coalesence of the terraces according to @xcite .",
    "a refined model would be necessary to take into account any effects related to anisotropic growth as found by pina _",
    "_ @xcite or to account for the curvature of small spirals .",
    "since we are interested in the basic mechanisms we refrain from such detailed modelling and just consider infinite step trains which on average are a distance @xmath4 apart ; see fig .",
    "[ modelscheme ] .",
    "typically , @xmath4 is in the nanometer - regime .",
    "the coordinates @xmath5 , characterizing the distance from the crystal surface and @xmath6 , orthogonal to the steps , are indicated .",
    "this describes a one - dimensional crystal surface which starts at @xmath7 , i.e. the total system is a 2d - system .",
    "in general , quantities like the solute concentration @xmath8 depend on @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",
    "conceptually , the @xmath6-dependence can be separated into two different contributions .",
    "first , there exists a periodic contribution with quasiperiod @xmath4 .",
    "it expresses the fact that the concentration close to the steps will be smaller .",
    "however , in the limit , considered below , only the concentration , averaged over the length scale of @xmath4 , will enter .",
    "therefore this @xmath6-dependence of @xmath8 is not relevant .",
    "second , there can be variations on length scales much larger than @xmath4 .",
    "experimentally , it is observed that the growth behavior does not change along the surface of one crystallite of size 150  @xmath9 at a given time .",
    "furthermore , a straightforward extension of the stability analysis , presented below , shows that the maximum instability for fluctuations along one crystal surface are for zero wave vector .",
    "thus it is realistic to hope that the leading mechanism of oz can be derived from study of the @xmath5-dependence alone . in the present work",
    ", we will therefore neglect a possible long - range @xmath6-dependence and restrict ourselves to the 1d model .",
    "scheme of the 2d - model .",
    "the concentration is averaged over a sufficiently large @xmath6-region , giving rise to a 1d - model with a concentration @xmath10 . ]    in the present paper we deal with a two species model ( @xmath11 ) for the crystal growth from solution ( ba and sr , respectively ) , thereby neglecting possible variations of the so@xmath3 concentration .",
    "this can be justified in two ways .",
    "first , using the oz model by lheureux @xcite we have verified that a system with artificially fixed so@xmath3 concentration exhibits basically the same dynamics @xcite .",
    "second , it describes also the solid state formation for the three component system so@xmath3 , ba , and sr , studied by putnis _",
    "_ when the concentration of so@xmath3 is sufficiently high .",
    "the mole fraction of component 1 on the crystal surface is denoted by @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) . throughout this work",
    "we assume the same molar volume for both species in the solid phase .",
    "the central element of this model is the coupling term between the crystal growth rate and the surface species concentration .",
    "we have used the classical approach by gilmer _",
    "@xcite which itself builds on the bcf - theory @xcite : solute particles adsorb on the crystal surface and diffuse along it .",
    "if before desorbing they come into contact with a step on the crystal surface , they are incorporated . if they do not meet a step in time , they desorb and become part of the solution again .    on their path along the crystal surface",
    "the adatoms experience many different local environments depending on the crystal composition .",
    "the mean energy difference @xmath14 of the adsorption reflects the interaction with the crystal surface and the solvation process . within the mean - field description",
    "it can be approximated by a linear combination of the different adsorption energies : @xmath15 here , @xmath16 is the adsorption energy for component @xmath17 on a surface formed by component @xmath18 and @xmath19 represents the solvation energy of species @xmath17 .    in the subsequent mathematical treatment",
    "it is useful to rewrite expressions in the symmetrized form @xmath20 where the dimensionless potentials @xmath21 and the mean homogeneous adsorption energy @xmath22 have been introduced .",
    "here , @xmath23 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath24 the temperature .",
    "the potential @xmath25 represents the asymmetry between homogeneous adsorption energies , whereas @xmath26 is a measure for the preference of homogeneous over heterogeneous adsorption .",
    "we consider the case @xmath27 .",
    "the potential @xmath25 can be assumed to be nonnegative due to symmetry reasons ; see eq .  .",
    "the limit @xmath28 implies @xmath29 , so that the crystal growth properties of species 2 are independent of the composition of the crystal surface . the case @xmath30 , corresponding to a different type of crystal growth instability , is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the last parameter @xmath31 reflects the solution energy difference of the two types of particles .",
    "for the crystal growth two time scales are of primary importance .",
    "first , the inverse of the adsorption time @xmath32 denotes the rate with which a particle in the solution layer above the crystal surface adsorbs .",
    "thus , @xmath33 is the particle flux on the crystal surface where @xmath34 is the typical distance between atoms and @xmath35 the mean concentration of component @xmath17 in the solution just above the crystal surface .",
    "we assume that @xmath32 is the same for both species .",
    "second , @xmath36 is the mean residence time of adatoms on the surface .",
    "detailed balance between both time scales requires @xmath37\\,.\\ ] ] thus the composition - dependence of @xmath36 is due to the composition - dependence of the adsorption potentials @xmath14 . from @xmath36",
    "the mean diffusion length @xmath38 can be obtained using the einstein relation @xmath39.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the adatom diffusion coefficient @xmath40 characterizes the elementary atomic movements of the adatoms on the crystal surface .",
    "we also assume that @xmath40 is the same for both the species",

    "@xcite we have neglected a term , representing the equilibrium concentration which is irrelevant under significant supersaturation as present in the experiment .",
    "the adsorption of a particle is hindered by the breakup of the solution shell and consequently takes longer than a normal diffusion step in the solution bulk .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the adsorption time scale @xmath32 is much larger than the typical time scale @xmath45 of free diffusion in the solution , i.e. @xmath46 . since @xmath4 is also a microscopic length scale one may even expect that @xmath47",
    ". then the location of successive adsorption processes of the same particle are uncorrelated with respect to the position of the steps and this simple probabilistic approach becomes justified .",
    "the growth is supported by surface diffusion from both the sides of a step . in the limit @xmath48 the atoms adsorbing within the distance @xmath38 of a step",
    "will typically contribute to crystal growth , whereas all the remaining adatoms will desorb after some time .",
    "therefore , the probability to meet a step is of the order of @xmath49 and can more precisely be expressed as @xcite @xmath50 for arbitrary ratio @xmath51 one obtains an additional factor @xmath52 which in the limit @xmath48 turns out to be unity @xcite .    for later convenience",
    "we gather the system constants into a characteristic time @xmath53 and defining @xmath54 the individual growth rates can be written as @xmath55 then the resulting continuity relation at the crystal surface reads @xmath56 this expresses the particle flux , on the left side , from the solution to the crystal and , on the right side , in the continuous solution close to the surface .",
    "an analogous boundary condition has been used in the classical work by gilmer _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the description of the bulk solution follows the following picture : at the beginning of the experiment the components begin to diffuse from the reservoirs into the gel column .",
    "as their diffusion profiles begin to overlap close to the middle of the column and the nucleation barrier is overcome , crystallites form .",
    "due to the the narrow nucleation zone @xcite these nuclei must act as an effective sink with respect to the current of ba@xmath2 , sr@xmath2 , and so@xmath57 from their reservoirs .    based on these considerations , this model is set up as a source - sink - system with a gradient in between . in this aspect",
    "it differs distinctly from the models proposed by lheureux _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite , where the crystal is considered to be growing through a homogeneously supersaturated medium .",
    "consequentially an analogous boundary layer approximation can not be applied to the present system .",
    "experimentally , the following scales are observed @xcite : ( i ) growth velocity @xmath58  cm / s as estimated from the crystal thickness and the total growth time .",
    "( ii ) thickness @xmath59  cm of individual layers .",
    "( iii ) time @xmath60  s during which one pattern layer is formed .",
    "( iv ) bulk diffusion constant @xmath61  @xmath62/s .",
    "> from these observables two important length scales can be estimated .",
    "( i ) the length scale @xmath63 characterizes the spatial variations of the species distribution caused by oscillatory zoning .",
    "it is given by @xmath64  cm which is much larger than the crystal size .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the growth behavior does not change along one crystal surface , because during times of small change in @xmath12 the information about the local surface concentration can spread over the whole region . besides , it rationalizes the mean field approach discussed below .",
    "( ii ) furthermore , one may wonder to which degree the motion of the solid phase boundary caused by crystal growth can affect the diffusion fields . for small length scales the concentration field is determined by diffusion ( @xmath65 ) whereas for large scales it is determined by the ( nearly ) constant growth of the phase boundary ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the crossover length scale @xmath67 for which both processes are equally relevant can be thus estimated as @xmath68 which for the present situation is close to @xmath69  cm .",
    "this scale exceeds the system size by orders of magnitude .",
    "because of this estimate the effect of the growth induced motion of the crystallites boundaries on the solute diffusion is ignorable and the crystal surface can be regarded as fixed with respect to the mathematical model .    finally , we choose the external boundary condition such that the reservoir is characterized by a constant influx @xmath70 of solute into the system at @xmath71 where @xmath72 is an arbitrary large length scale .",
    "to complete the model , a governing equation for the evolution of the crystal surface composition is necessary . assuming a homogeneous distribution of the components throughout the surface , the composition change with the next time increment @xmath73 can be expressed as a function of the current composition @xmath12 and the relation of the growth rates @xmath42 : @xmath74\\,.\\ ] ] this relation reflects mass conservation and has already been used in previous work on oz @xcite .",
    "the 1d formulation of the model discussed above can be described as follows .",
    "diffusion of the components @xmath11 through the solution is considered within the region @xmath75 $ ] and is described by the equation @xmath76 where @xmath72 should be chosen large enough to satisfy @xmath77 . at the external boundary @xmath78 the influx of both the components",

    "the lines of the limit cycle connecting the increasing branches of the nullcline @xmath97 are not horizontal but inclined to the @xmath12-axis at a certain visible angle .",
    "it should be noted that this inclination is not a standard consequence of the finite ratio between the time scales of fast and slow dynamics because , otherwise , the form of these curves would deviate form the straight lines substantially .",

    "this effect of `` adhesion '' to the unstable branch of @xmath97 is of another nature than the well known `` french duck '' fragment of the limit cycle for standard relaxation oscillations ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , caused by the close proximity of the stationary point to the extreme of the nullcline .",
    "the two time patterns of the observed oscillations deviate substantially in shape both from the quasiharmonic oscillations and relaxation oscillations .",
    "especially for the flux @xmath226 the found pattern looks like a sequence of pronounced spikes joined by fragments of slow motion along the left decreasing branch of @xmath97 .",
    "the resulting crystal profiles are shown in fig .",
    "[ patterns ] . basically , the profiles are scaled mirror images of the time - dependent @xmath12 as shown in figs .",
    "[ f100 ] and [ f110 ] , because the growth velocity only weakly varies with time .",
    "as should be expected the spatial oscillation period is orders or magnitude larger than the atomic scale .",
    "we have presented a 1d model for oz . the growth rate as the central non - linear coupling term between the solution and the crystal was derived based on layer - by - layer crystal growth mechanisms . for this purpose particle adsorption , surface diffusion and finally desorption or inclusion processes at the steps",
    "are taken into account . this way",
    ", adsorbed particles do not only experience the local environment of their adsorption site , but a much more averaged one depending strongly on the composition of the crystal surface .",
    "this is an essential feature of the present model , because together with volumetric species diffusion it may provide the synchronization effect necessary to successfully describe the experimental findings in more than one dimension .",
    "our model ( eqs.- ) differs in several respects from the existing model of lheureux _ et al .",
    "( i ) the most essential difference is the choice of the growth mechanism , i.e. the definition of the growth rate @xmath231 . in refs .",
    "@xcite a phenomenological equation based on local atom adsorption @xcite is formulated .",
    "it is one of the simplest polynomial expression for @xmath231 which displays nonlinear behavior .",
    "( ii ) the boundary condition at @xmath7 used in @xcite for crystal growth from solution can be written as @xmath232 in our notation . here",
    "one uses @xmath233 .",
    "it is identical to eq .   if ( d / d@xmath234 . but as soon as @xmath12 changes with time both boundary conditions are not identical",
    "actually , to derive eq .   one can formulate the mass balance in a newly generated crystal layer .",
    ".   only emerges if the @xmath12-value in the layer at some time , determining the nature of the growth rates @xmath231 during the growth of the new layer is identical to the @xmath12-value in the resulting new layer . in general",
    "this is not the case .",
    "thus we feel that eq .",
    "is more generally valid although from a practical point of view no essential difference should be present .",
    "( iii ) we specify the gradient at @xmath78 whereas in @xcite the concentration is given .",
    "our choice is conceptually more simple because the value of @xmath72 does not enter the calculations ( see e.g. eq .  ) .",
    "however , the underlying physical picture does not change whether the gradient or the concentration itself are fixed as long as @xmath72 is sufficiently large .",
    "( iv ) another distinctive difference is the explicit calculation of the diffusion field in the solution above the crystal .",
    "we do not apply the boundary layer approximation , regarding a crystal growing through a supersaturated solution @xcite , but we neglect the spatial growth with respect to the diffusion .",
    "this way , we obtain a source - sink system with a diffusion field that has to be treated explicitly , because the interaction of particle accumulation or depletion on the solution side and the autocatalytic growth on the crystal side is essential for the existence of oz .",
    "in addition , we perform the stability analysis without further approximations",
    ". this may be essential because the oscillatory dynamics can stem from the counteraction of strong `` forces '' mutually compensating each other at the first approximation .",
    "we would like to mention that in @xcite the system of equations has been numerically solved without invoking the boundary layer approximation . on a qualitative level",
    "similar results were obtained as compared to the analytical treatment within the boundary layer approximation .",
    "( v ) the surface roughness parameter , used in @xcite , is not necessary in the present analysis .",
    "the proposed growth mechanism is valid for @xmath235 . in the limit of @xmath236 incorporation",
    "would be governed by the local crystal composition , again . in case of @xmath237 desorption",
    "can be neglected and nearly every adatom will be incorporated regardless of its type and @xmath12 .",
    "this would result in crystals exhibiting the stoichiometric compositions @xcite of the influx .",
    "the present model can not exhibit the bistability found in @xcite , because the composition of the only stationary point is determined by the influx ratio .",
    "any crystal growth with a composition different from this ratio will result in a buildup of the currently `` disfavored '' component until its growth rate increases .",
    "thus the oscillations have to revolve around or run into this fixed point .",
    "this corresponds well to the model picture , where a bistability is only possible if either the supersaturation is not high enough with respect to the minor component or if complementary crystals grow in close vicinity .",
    "the time scales of diffusion and crystal growth define the qualitative behavior of the oscillations . at very low concentrations the crystal growth rate and consequently",
    "the changes in crystal composition are very slow .",
    "the diffusive processes on the other hand are fast enough to counteract this and no oscillatory behavior is observed . with rising solute concentrations the growth rate increases as well , whereas the characteristic speed of diffusion stays constant resulting in soft transitions and sinusoidal oscillations .",
    "at even higher concentrations , the speed of crystal composition change supercedes the diffuse reaction of the solution by many orders , creating sharp transitions , closely following @xmath97 .",
    "this qualitative description coincides with the results from the linear stability analysis at low influx it is stable possessing two imaginary eigenvalues with negative real parts . at @xmath149",
    "the real part changes sign and the system becomes unstable .    finally , the numerical calculation of asymmetrical systems show the stabilization of a formerly unstable branch of @xmath97 .",
    "if the fixed point is shifted far enough onto the stable branch , the trajectories slowly approach it along the nullcline , but upon nearly reaching it are directed away with the onset of new oscillations .",
    "the amplitude of these oscillations can have continuously growing character or they can exhibit certain characteristic values",
    ". this might be the onset of frequency doubling and provide a route into chaotic behavior of the system .",
    "this however , is beyond the scope of the present manuscript .",
    "the presented boundary reaction diffusion model , describing oz of crystals grown from solution .",
    "thereby it applies a mechanism including surface diffusion , which can be derived from microscopic properties .",
    "oz arises due to diffusive build up of the disfavored component above the crystal until the autocatalytic growth process in combination with the large population turn the crystal composition in favor of the formerly disfavored species .",
    "a linear stability analysis was carried out without further approximations .",
    "the results correspond to the experimental findings of a supersaturation threshold before the onset of oz . numerical simulations of asymmetric cases show a stabilization of previously unstable parts of the system .",
