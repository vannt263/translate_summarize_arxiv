    "the electron transport properties of atomic point contacts between two metallic electrodes have been intensively studied during the past decade @xcite .",
    "contacts of this type are typically formed by using mechanically controllable break junctions ( mcbj ) or with the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) .",
    "it has been found that the conductance of such contacts depends strongly on the electronic structure of the metals , and for monovalent metals there is a tendency for quantization in units of the conductance quantum @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "point contacts formed from gold ( au ) , platinum ( pt ) , or iridium ( ir ) by one of the mcbj or stm methods have the further interesting property of being able to sustain single - atom thick chains , so called atomic wires @xcite . following their discovery ,",
    "a good amount of experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite work has been carried out to further investigate the conduction properties of atomic wires .",
    "it is by now well established that the zero - bias conductance of gold wires is close to one @xmath1 due to a single , almost fully open transmission channel at the fermi energy @xcite .",
    "however , less detailed work has been done in the study of truly nonequilibrium properties , such as the current - voltage characteristics @xcite .    in recent experiments ,",
    "the conductance vs. voltage characteristics @xmath2 of gold wires formed by the stm technique were measured @xcite .",
    "it was observed that the conductance often has a very pronounced , single drop from @xmath1 at a critical voltage @xmath3 mv , marking the onset of a dissipative process .",
    "the size of the drop was on the order of @xmath4 of @xmath1 .",
    "it was also found that stretching of the wire typically leads to an increase in the step , and to a decrease in the critical voltage @xmath5 .",
    "based on simple arguments for infinite single - orbital tight - binding chains , these findings were interpreted as a sign of the excitation of vibrational modes in the wire : only a single longitudinal mode with twice the fermi wave vector can be excited , since this corresponds to the momentum which must be transferred from an electron to the vibrations in a single backscattering process .",
    "although the validity of such arguments for a wire of finite length ( of typically less than 10 atoms ) can be questioned , the interpretation was backed up by first - principles calculations @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .   emphasize the importance of so - called alternating bond length ( abl ) modes , and in particular the longitudinal mode of highest frequency .",
    "although it seems evident that the interpretation based on vibrational modes is essentially correct , what is still lacking is a systematic study of the behavior of wires with varying numbers of atoms , and surrounded by various lead geometries .",
    "many questions of the basic physics are also still not very well understood : when exactly does the electron - vibration coupling lead to a drop and when an increase in the conductance ?",
    "why does there appear to be just a single drop in the experiments of ref .",
    ", although the momentum conservation is not exact ? what determines the height and width of this drop ? below we aim to discuss the possible answers to some of these questions .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on studying the current - voltage characteristics of gold wires .",
    "we use a slater - koster @xcite type tight - binding ( tb ) approach , where the parameters are taken from the non - orthogonal parametrization of papaconstantopoulos and coworkers @xcite .",
    "the use of such a parametrization @xcite makes the modeling of atomic wires computationally less intensive as compared with fully _ ab initio _ methods .",
    "the approach is still microscopic in that it takes into account the symmetries of the atomic @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 valence orbitals , which , via hybridization , form the conduction channels .",
    "it is also general enough to allow one to model everything within the same framework : we use the parameters to compute the total energy of the wire , and thus optimize the geometry .",
    "after this , the normal modes of oscillation and the electron - vibration coupling constants can be computed .",
    "finally , we calculate the transport properties using the non - equilibrium green function ( or keldysh ) approach .",
    "our implementation is very similar to that of ref .  , and the present work is , in essence , an extension of that to inelastic transport .",
    "in addition to the full _ ab initio _",
    "calculations @xcite , the effect of electron - vibration interactions on transport through molecular wires has been recently studied by some simple single - level models @xcite .",
    "the tight - binding approach stands somewhere in between these two extremes .",
    "we compute the conductance to lowest nontrivial order in the electron - vibration coupling constant .",
    "there are essentially two well - defined limits which can be studied . in the first limit",
    "the vibrational - mode distribution remains in equilibrium due to a strong coupling of the modes to an external equilibrium bath formed by the leads . in the opposite limit",
    "the distribution is driven to strong non - equilibrium by the bias voltage .",
    "these are the _ externally damped _ and the _ externally undamped _ limits of ref .  .",
    "however , in the first limit one should also account for the strong broadening of the vibrational modes .",
    "we derive equations which take this into account in a phenomenological manner .    with our simple , self - contained method of optimizing the geometry ,",
    "we obtain vibrational frequencies which are of the correct order of magnitude , usually to within a factor of two .",
    "we study how the positions and heights of the conductance drops due to the electron - vibration coupling vary with elongation of a linear wire , and find a good overall agreement with the experiments of ref .  .",
    "the height of the conductance steps grows together with the length of the wire , being typically of the order 0.5%  5% of @xmath1 for wires of 11 atoms or less . as found in the earlier calculations",
    "@xcite , we find that the highest - frequency longitudinal modes usually couple most strongly , although there seems to be no fundamental reason for a bias toward the `` abl '' modes .",
    "but in contrast to previous theoretical results , the conductance drop is usually found to occur in two or more consecutive steps which are due to several close - lying longitudinal vibrational modes .",
    "thus we find the `` mode selectivity '' to be only very approximate .",
    "however , the steps can be made to merge into a single one , when we introduce a large enough phenomenological broadening to the vibrational modes , such that the experimentally observed step widths of @xmath9 mev are accounted for .",
    "we also briefly study the conductance signatures of chains which have a zigzag - like form , instead of the linear one .",
    "the paper is divided into the following parts . in sec .",

    ", we simply use semi - infinite `` bars '' , where the repeat unit consists of two layers , with 12 and 13 atoms respectively , mimicking an infinite fcc [ 001 ] surface , where the @xmath12 axis is always chosen parallel to the axis of the wire .",
    "the particular choice for the leads should not be very important , as long as they are infinite in one direction , and wider than the contact region . in geometry",
    "b , the chain connects to small clusters of atoms or `` pyramids '' on the surfaces ( in our case consisting of 9 atoms ) , making it perhaps the more realistic one of the two . for technical reasons ,",
    "the geometry is divided into three parts , the semi - infinite left ( @xmath13 ) and right ( @xmath14 ) leads , and the `` central cluster '' ( @xmath15 ) , which also includes the pyramids if any .",

    "we shall also consider some simple models where the regions @xmath13 , @xmath15 , and @xmath14 are parts of an infinite linear wire .",

    "the solution of the inelastic transport problem involves a few rather separated sub - problems : the optimization of the geometry and evaluation of the vibrational modes , estimation of the electron - vibration coupling constants , and finally the calculation of the transport . in the following",
    "we give only a brief description of each of them , and refer the reader to appendixes for details .",
    "our basic approach is to solve for the elastic transmission problem exactly , and then to take the electron - vibration coupling into account in a slightly modified version of lowest - order perturbation theory .",
    "other works have considered the so - called self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) @xcite , where some of the terms in the perturbation expansions are effectively summed to infinite order . however",

    "the fermi wavevector is then @xmath203 , where @xmath204 is the inter - atomic distance .",

    "furthermore , if the atomic orbitals are invariant with respect to rotations around the axis of the chain ( @xmath6-wave , say ) the modes can only be longitudinal ones . as it happens , @xmath206 corresponds exactly to the brillouin zone boundary and thus to the highest - frequency modes .",
    "more technically , the momentum conservation can be seen to follow from the form of the fourier - transforms @xmath207 of the coupling matrix elements @xmath208 @xcite .",
    "we note that the momentum conservation can only be strictly valid if one considers the actual vibrational modes of the whole infinite chain .",
    "interestingly , it appears to remain approximately valid even if the vibrational modes are restricted only to a small , finite part of the chain @xcite .",
    "indeed , as found in ref .",
    ", when the fermi energy is in the middle of the band , there is only a single visible step in the conductance .",

    "although such a single - orbital model can correctly describe the most important experimental observations , it neglects some details of realistic gold wires .",

    "the density of states is defined as @xmath214 , where @xmath23 now stands for atomic sites and @xmath24 for orbitals .",
    "the results are very similar to those of the single - orbital chain @xcite , but the situation is a bit closer to what happens in the full @xmath10 model .",
    "for example , the hybridization of @xmath6 and @xmath209 result in a _ gap _ in the dos .",
    "if we still populate the chain with one electron per site , the fermi energy will again be in the middle of the lower band ( the `` @xmath6 band '' ) , and there is only a single drop in the conductance .",
    "this is illustrated by the @xmath215 ev case in fig .",
    "[ f.spzchain ] .",
    "but for @xmath121 s deviating from the center of the band , we find that the conductance step generally consists of several substeps , although the total step height remains almost the same .",

    "it must be noted , however , that the assumption of the wbl will break down if the fermi energy is very close to a band edge .    within this model of a gold chain , it is probably most physical to occupy the atoms with a single electron per site . however , in a more realistic description the @xmath6 and @xmath209 orbitals hybridize also with lower - energy @xmath8 orbitals . also",
    ", the real systems are not translationally invariant , and charge neutrality need not be fully satisfied locally . such things can complicate the picture enormously .",
    "furthermore , the arbitrariness of the charge - neutrality procedure in the full @xmath10 model below renders the position of the fermi energy with respect to the electronic structure of the wire somewhat uncertain .",
    "thus , as we shall see , all of the cases shown in fig .",
    "[ f.spzchain ] are actually good descriptions of our results for the full @xmath10 model .",
    "although at low temperature there can be several peaks , at higher temperatures the steps fuse together , since the vibrational frequencies of the different modes are quite close to each other .",

    "the small @xmath132 also affects the results in another way : since the `` lead coupling '' of vibrations is small , the wire heats , and the distribution functions @xmath128 differ strongly from the bose distribution .",
    "the signature of this heating is the steep downward slope of the @xmath2 curves at high voltage @xcite .",
    "we have also tested the effect of @xmath218th - nearest - neighbor hoppings and addition of nonorthogonality , but these have no essential qualitative effect on the results .",
    "these will be taken into account in the full @xmath10 parametrization , which we now turn to .",
    "in this section we describe a more realistic tight - binding approach to the problem .",

    "this type of @xmath10 tb approach is known to reproduce very well some nontrivial _ ab initio _ results , like the numbers of conduction channels and the formation of zigzag au chains @xcite .",
    "thus we can be confident that the method gives at least good order - of - magnitude estimates for all of the quantities which we shall be interested in .    however ,",
    "since the parameters are extracted from first - principles _ bulk _ calculations , they can not be exactly correct for atomic point contacts , where the important atoms of the structure are significantly less coordinated than in bulk .",
    "it has thus become customary in the method to `` correct '' the parameters in the central cluster in order to satisfy local charge neutrality .",
    "doing this typically brings the central cluster levels better in resonance with the lead orbitals .",
    "we compute the charge with the so - called mulliken population analysis ( see appendix [ s.cder ] ) , and only shift the on - site energies of the hamiltonian .",
    "tests with other ways of achieving neutrality give very similar results @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have compared to results obtained without charge neutrality , and again find that there is not much qualitative difference , although charge neutrality yields conductances closer to @xmath1 on average .",
    "also , without charge neutrality there appears to be a tendency for seeing lower - frequency vibrational modes in the conductance curves .",

    "we only optimize the geometry of the @xmath11 chain atoms  also in geometry b which has the `` pyramids '' .",
    "thus , although the interatomic distances change slightly from those of fig .",
    "[ f.chaindims ] , @xmath221 remains fixed .    to estimate the total energy @xmath42 ,",
    "we simply take a cluster which includes the wire and some atoms from the leads , solve for the electronic eigenstates @xmath225 , and then occupy the states according to charge neutrality .",
    "this energy , as a function of the @xmath90 wire coordinates , is then optimized with standard library routines .",
    "as known previously @xcite , it is often energetically favorable for the gold chains to exist in a zigzag - like pattern instead of a linear one . only after a sufficient amount of stretching ( i.e. , with a larger @xmath8 )",
    "does the linear configuration become stable , after which it remains linear until the wire breaks .",
    "we find that the maximum @xmath8 at breaking is , depending on the geometry , typically something between 2.702.85  .",
    "there is no clear trend with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "after the geometry is optimized , the energy function is used to compute the hessian matrix @xmath50 . the eigenvalues @xmath226 ( @xmath227 )",
    "are all positive , and the vibrational frequencies are simply given by @xmath228 . with both geometries , a and b",
    ", we obtain quite similar vibrational frequencies and modes . for a linear wire",
    ", the modes can be classified as longitudinal or transverse in character .",
    "the highest - frequency modes are then always longitudinal ones , and the highest of them is of the abl type @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most characteristic experimental property of gold chains is that they appear to have a conductance very close to the quantum of conductance @xmath1 .",
    "thus we shall briefly comment on the elastic transmission properties of the chains in our calculations .",
    "the present tb method was previously only used with bulk distances @xmath229  between all the atoms @xcite . in this case",
    ", we find very similar transmission functions @xmath230 for our geometry b. these are often characterized by very long plateaus ( of widths up to @xmath231 ev ) around the fermi energy @xmath121 , where @xmath232 .",
    "the same is true for the results with and without charge neutrality .",
    "however , when the geometry is optimized , the wide transmission plateaus close to one are replaced by larger oscillations . still , at the fermi energy , there is usually only a single open channel , which consists of @xmath6 , @xmath209 , and @xmath210 orbitals .",
    "sometimes , a small contribution is seen arising from a second channel , involving the other @xmath7 and @xmath8 orbitals , as will be discussed below @xcite .",
    "the transmission around @xmath121 varies between @xmath233 .",
    "the present method is known to reproduce experimental conductance histograms rather well @xcite . in particular , the conductance peak somewhat below @xmath234 is a very robust feature .",
    "we determine @xmath121 by charge neutrality in the leads ( or bulk ) .",
    "tests with shifting its value from this position by @xmath235 ev ( which simulates a gate effect ) showed no significant qualitative effects on the results .",
    "the position of the fermi energy with respect to the local electronic structure is still very important .",
    "this is because , besides the elastic transmission , the fermi energy also fixes the `` fermi wavevector '' , which again determines what vibrational modes can be excited . in the present tb method ,",
    "the use of bulk parameters and the charge neutrality procedure introduces some uncertainty in relation to this point .",
    "let us first discuss the basic observations using a simple example , namely , a linear chain of four atoms in geometry a. a schematic illustration of the vibrational modes is shown in fig .",
    "[ f.fourmodes ] for @xmath236  .",
    "there are four longitudinal modes and eight transverse modes .",
    "however , due to the fourfold rotation symmetry of the geometry around the axis of the wire , the transverse modes are all doubly degenerate .",
    "the zero - bias conductance is due to two partially open channels .",
    "the main contribution ( about 98% of @xmath1 ) is due to a channel ( @xmath237 ) formed from @xmath6 , @xmath209 , and @xmath210 orbitals , which have the symmetry of the geometry .",
    "in addition , there is a small ( less than 1% of @xmath1 ) contribution from a second , doubly degenerate channel ( @xmath238 ) , which consists of @xmath239 , @xmath240 , @xmath241 , and @xmath242 orbitals , which have a lower symmetry .",
    "thanks to the symmetry of the @xmath237 channel , only longitudinal modes have a finite coupling constant in its subspace ( @xmath243 ) . in the subspace of the @xmath238 channel , also the transverse modes have a finite coupling ( @xmath244 ) .",
    "thus we might expect that also the transverse modes give a small signal in the current .",
    "figure [ f.inel ] shows an analysis of the contribution from the different modes to the differential conductance @xmath117 .",
    "we divide this conductance into three parts according to the three current contributions : @xmath245 .",
    "here @xmath0 , @xmath246 , and @xmath247 .",
    "it is seen that @xmath248 gives always positive contributions to the conductance steps , while @xmath249 gives negative ones .",
    "as expected , we find that there is a finite step in both @xmath248 and @xmath249 due to _ all _ of the vibrational modes , also the transverse ones , although the latter are quite small . however , the contributions of @xmath248 and @xmath249 for the transverse modes almost perfectly _ cancel _ each other , such that only steps due to the longitudinal modes are seen in the total @xmath2 .",
    "this cancellation is apparently due to the exact fourfold rotation symmetry , and the mirror symmetry with respect to the plane cutting the wire in the middle . in less symmetric geometries",
    "the transverse modes can also give finite contributions to @xmath2 .",
    "in the case of zigzag wires , the distinction between longitudinal and transverse modes does not really exist , and all modes are always seen as steps in @xmath2 .",
    "an example of this is shown below . furthermore ,",
    "if the elastic transmission @xmath250 is very small , then also the transport coefficients @xmath143 and @xmath139 tend to be small , since they all depend on the matrix @xmath251 . in this way , for example",
    ", it may also be possible to have large _ positive _ steps in @xmath2 , but we never see them for the charge - neutral gold wires . for other materials ,",
    "the situation may be different .",
    "thus , we find that the conductance features depend in an intricate way on the symmetries of the geometry , the symmetries of the vibrational modes , the coupling constants , as well as the symmetries of the electronic states which are relevant at the fermi energy .      here",
    "we discuss in more detail , how our conductance - voltage curves for linear wires look like .",
    "figure [ f.comp1 ] shows an example for geometry a with a wire of @xmath252 atoms while fig .",
    "[ f.comp2 ] is for a wire of @xmath253 atoms in geometry b. in both figures , the left - hand panels are calculated at @xmath254 k and with a small @xmath132 , such that they are more or less in the externally undamped regime .",
    "the right - hand panels show two examples of the experimental results for a wire of approximately 7 atoms taken at the temperature @xmath254 k @xcite . comparing these to the theoretical curves on the left - hand side ,",
    "one immediately notices that if the conductance drop is to be due to a single mode , then the @xmath9 mev width of the peak in the experimental @xmath255 can not be explained by temperature alone @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy distance between the vibrational modes is rather large @xmath256 , so that at @xmath254 k , a peak consisting of several sub - peaks can usually be easily recognized .",
    "for example , the highest - frequency peak in fig .",
    "[ f.comp2 ] actually consists of two peaks , and it is still not wide enough . also in fig .",
    "[ f.comp1 ] there are at least three separate peaks visible .    thus we conclude that in the experiment there are probably other broadening mechanisms at play besides temperature . in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ f.comp1 ] we compare the experiment with a theoretical result broadened by a higher temperature , while in the right panels of fig .  [ f.comp2 ] we use the parameter @xmath132 to broaden the peaks . in the latter ,",
    "the system is already in the externally damped regime , with very little local heating : in addition to the broadening , the damping is signified by a smaller slope after the drop . in either case , the peaks due to individual modes are smoothed out to form a single one , with a width comparable to that seen in experiments . in this way , it is possible to obtain a rather good quantitative correspondence between theory and experiment .",
    "we have also studied systematically how the main features of the conductance - voltage curves vary when linear chains with atom numbers @xmath257 are stretched .",

    "the @xmath258 values fluctuate between @xmath261 and @xmath262 , but there is no clear `` parity effect ''  or at least the effect appears to reverse its direction after @xmath263 .",
    "the present method most likely does not describe such parity effects correctly .",
    "however , also different _ ab initio _ approaches are known to give conflicting results @xcite . in some calculations , the transmission has been found to oscillate also with the stretching of a wire with fixed @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the positions of the peaks move to lower voltages when the wire is stretched , as expected from the `` softening '' of the bonds , and the resulting decrease in the vibrational frequencies .",
    "there is also a clear trend toward lower frequencies with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "these findings are similar to what is seen in the experiment @xcite .",
    "also similarly , the peak heights increase with stretching , and with increasing @xmath11 , although the increase with wire length @xmath221 is not obviously linear as for the simple chain models of sec .",
    "[ s.simple ] @xcite .",
    "there is also a correlation between the zero - bias conductances and the peak heights : when the conductance is low , also the stretching behavior is rather anomalous ( in particular in the cases of 5 and 10 atoms . )",
    "the most visible difference between the results of fig .",
    "[ f.peaks ] and the experiment is that we consistently see signatures of several vibrational modes : typically there are two peaks visible in @xmath255 .",
    "however , the higher peak is always at a larger voltage and , as the number of atoms @xmath11 grows , the secondary peaks become less and less significant . for example , for @xmath264 atoms there is essentially only a single peak visible ( see fig .",
    "[ f.comp2 ] ) .",
    "this , however , is due to two close - lying modes : the highest - frequency `` abl '' mode , and the one next to it in frequency .",
    "as explained above , this discrepancy of several peaks can be corrected by increasing the parameter @xmath132 .",
    "note also that this behavior was already present in the chain model of sec .",
    "[ s.simple ] .",
    "we also see that the largest conductance drops are systematically at too high voltages compared to experimental values @xmath265 mv for a 7-atom chain .",
    "this is not surprising , given the simplified way in which we compute the vibrational modes .",
    "the frequencies of the vibrational modes might be lowered , if we also allowed for the motion of atoms outside of the chain . in other words ,",
    "it is possible that the lead coupling , done in a proper way , would lead to a `` redshift '' of the frequencies .",
    "as noted above , the electron - vibration coupling gives such a redshift @xcite , but this effect may be too small to explain the discrepancy .",
    "although the steps in conductance are almost always downward when @xmath258 is close to @xmath1 , sometimes also weak increases in the conductance at low voltage can be seen .",
    "these appear to be related to the longitudinal `` center - of - mass '' mode . for linear chains",
    ", we do not find any significant contribution from transverse modes , as explained previously .",
    "we have also studied briefly the zigzag chains shown in fig .",
    "[ f.lcr ] .",
    "figure [ f.zigzag6 ] shows a comparison between the signatures of a zigzag chain and a linear chain in the conductance - voltage curves @xmath2 . in this example , a chain of @xmath266 atoms in geometry a , and a large broadening of the vibrational modes ( @xmath267 mev ) was used .",
    "however , very similar results were found for various different atom numbers . for small values of @xmath8 ,",
    "the wire has a zigzag character , but at @xmath268  , the wire becomes linear .    for the zigzag chain , there are two well - separated ( series of ) conductance drops .",
    "the one at low bias is higher for small @xmath8 s .",
    "as the chain is stretched , the height of the lower - frequency step decreases , while that of the higher - frequency one increases . for the linear chain , there is essentially only one high - voltage drop , which is actually due to two different longitudinal modes . in the case of a zigzag wire ,",
    "the vibrational modes have complicated symmetries , and practically all of them are contributing to the current steps .",
    "however , here their identities are completely smeared out due to the broadening .",
    "this calculation provides a clear prediction of how the zigzag - to - linear transition may be seen in experiments .",
    "we have studied the onset of dissipation by excitation of vibrational modes in atomic gold wires , using a tight - binding model .",
    "we have studied in a systematic way how the stretching of wires with different atomic numbers affects the conductance steps , and find a reasonable agreement with experiments .",
    "previously such a study has only been done within simple chain models @xcite .",
    "we have also considered two different geometries , which yield qualitatively similar results . finally , we studied the conductance signatures of zigzag - type wires , and predict a double - step structure in contrast to the single step of linear chains .",
    "our results for the linear chains agree rather well with experiments and previous _ ab initio _ calculations , apart from the incomplete `` mode selectivity '' . in this context , we have pointed out the importance of taking into account the broadening of vibrational modes due to their coupling to the leads , especially in the limit where the vibrational mode distribution is assumed to be strongly damped .",
    "we derived equations in the wide - band limit , which take this into account in a phenomenological manner .",
    "the wide - band limit combined with the lowest - order perturbation approach ( presented in sec .  [ s.wbl ] and appendix [ s.form ] ) appears to provide a sufficiently good description of the phenomenology of electron - vibration interaction in atomic wires . to make further progress ,",
    "more detailed calculations of the lead - coupling of the vibrational modes are needed .    as explained above ,",
    "the condition which determines what modes yield conductance drops is essentially that of momentum conservation .",
    "we find numerically that the momentum - conservation idea works well also for finite wires with 10 atoms or more .",
    "however , in shorter wires , the electronic structure is very complicated , and the connection between symmetries of excited modes and those of the electronic states is hard to analyze .    even if there is approximate momentum conservation , there is no fundamental reason why only a single mode would be excited , or that the highest - frequency ( or other abl ) modes should necessarily be involved .",
    "this remains true also for very long wires , since at the same time when the momentum conservation becomes more and more accurately satisfied , also the energy density ( and hence momentum - space density ) of the modes increases .",
    "it is thus more likely that a large `` wave packet '' of several nearby phonon modes is always excited .",
    "however , the charge neutrality of the wire indeed appears to be favoring the highest - frequency modes , just as predicted by the simple chain models discussed in sec .",
    "[ s.simple ] . nevertheless , it is important to note that small differences in details of the geometry or the implementation may affect numerical values of results significantly .",
    "the band structure of an infinite , linear gold wire is already quite complicated @xcite , such that a small error in the fermi energy , and hence of the fermi wavevector , will immediately shift the resonance to slightly different vibrational modes .",
    "studying different materials ( pt and ir ) with this same method would be straightforward in principle .",
    "however , it seems that the parameters available for these materials are not very good for geometry optimizations of the wires .",
    "this is because the overlap matrices easily lose their positive definiteness when the validity range of the parametrization is exceeded ( with the gold parameters @xcite , such problems never appeared ) .",
    "thus , as already implied in ref .  , one should probably use more general _ ab initio _ methods , or at least parameters which have been specifically fit to work for chain geometries with a large span of interatomic distances .",
    "compared to _ ab initio _ methods , tb still has the clear advantage of being computationally efficient .",

    "<S> the vibrational modes , the coupling constants , and the inelastic transport are all calculated using a tight - binding parametrization and the non - equilibrium green function formalism . </S>",
    "<S> the electron - vibration coupling gives rise to small drops in the conductance at voltages corresponding to energies of some of the vibrational modes . </S>",
    "<S> we study systematically how the position and height of these steps vary as a linear wire is stretched and more atoms are added to it , and find a good agreement with the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider two different types of geometries , which are found to yield qualitatively similar results . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous calculations , we find that typically there are several close - lying drops due to different longitudinal modes . in the experiments , </S>",
    "<S> only a single drop is usually visible , but its width is too large to be accounted for by temperature . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to explain the experimental results , we find it necessary to introduce a finite broadening to the vibrational modes , which makes the separate drops merge into a single , wide one . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we predict how the signatures of vibrational modes in the conductance curves differ between linear and zigzag - type wires . </S>"
