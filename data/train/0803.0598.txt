    "galaxy clusters trace the densest environments in the universe . they thus constitute the best laboratories to study galaxy evolution since ( 1 ) they contain a large number of galaxies at essentially the same cosmic time , ( 2 ) their environment is extreme compared to the field so galaxy transformations are constantly present , and ( 3 ) they can be traced to large lookback times .",
    "yet the baryon budget in clusters is not all that well constrained mainly because it is not clear whether all baryonic constituents have been identified and quantified ( e.g. , ettori 2003 ; mccarthy , bower , & balogh 2007 ) . according to ettori ( 2003 ) these constituents",
    "are : hot baryons ( intracluster medium , 70% ) , cold baryons ( galaxies , stars and gas , 13% ) , and warm baryons ( unknown , 17 % ) .",
    "in addition to detecting galaxies and the intracluster medium in emission , clusters have recently been probed through absorption by metals in x - ray spectra of background agns ( takei et al .",
    "however , this absorption is rather associated with the hot intracluster gas and not with the cluster galaxies . since gas associated with",
    "_ field _ galaxies is known to produce detectable euv absorption in background quasar spectra , one could in principle probe the _ cold - warm _ ( @xmath21 k ) gas associated with cluster galaxies using this quasar absorption line ( qal ) technique .",
    "one great advantage of the qal technique is that it provides a sensitive measure of the gas that is independent of redshift and host - galaxy brightness .",
    "in this paper we present the first spectroscopic survey of background quasars having foreground clusters in the line of sight .",
    "the survey is aimed at probing metal absorbers possibly associated with the cluster galaxies .",
    "we concentrate on the incidence of the redshifted @xmath3   doublet , an excellent tracer of high - redshift galaxies ( bergeron & stasinska 1986 ; petitjean & bergeron 1990 ; steidel & sargent 2002 ; churchill et al .",
    "2000 ; zibetti et al . 2007 )",
    "for which extensive field surveys exist .",
    "the doublet has been used extensively in spectroscopic quasar surveys because it is a strong and an easy - to - find transition , and has a redshift coverage from the ground of @xmath22@xmath23 , matching imaging studies .",
    "redshifted metal absorption lines in a quasar spectrum appear together with absorption by neutral hydrogen in what is called absorption systems. the incidence of absorption systems , @xmath24 , i.e. , the probability of line - of - sight ( los ) intersection per unit redshift , and its equivalent width distribution , @xmath25 , are important observables as they depend both on the absorbing cross - section and number density of the absorbers .",
    "more importantly , these quantities can be measured without previous knowledge of the nature and environment of the absorbers , i.e. , galaxies , ly@xmath26  forest , etc .",
    "early  surveys ( e.g. , lanzetta , turnshek , & wolfe 1987 , tytler et al .",
    "1987 , steidel & sargent 1992 ) , sensitive to a rest - frame equivalent width ( rew ) threshold of @xmath27  , established a population of non - evolving absorbers up to @xmath28 with signs of clustering on scales @xmath29 km  s@xmath30  ( petitjean & bergeron 1990 ; steidel & sargent 1992 ) . more recent surveys ( churchill et al . 1999 [ hereafter crcv99 ] ; nestor , turnshek & rao . 2005 [ ntr05 ] ; nestor , turnshek & rao 2006 [ ntr06 ] , narayanan et al . 2007 , lynch , charlton & kim 2006 ; prochter , prochaska , & burles 2006 [ ppb06 ] ) have shown a clear dichotomy between strong and weak absorbers : the equivalent width distribution is steeper for weak systems than for strong ones , with a transition around @xmath31  .",
    "this has led some authors to propose different populations / environments for these two classes of systems ( ntr06 ) .    on the other hand , surveys of _ galaxies _ selected by -absorption",
    "have shown a population of normal morphology , bright galaxies , with absorption cross sections that range from a few to several tens of @xmath5 kpc  depending on rew .  was linked to bright galaxies early in the 90 s thanks to the work by steidel & sargent ( 1992 ) , bergeron & boiss ( 1991 ) , lanzetta & bowen ( 1990 ) , le brun et al .",

    "2002 ) , neutral gas ( ellison et al . 2004a",
    "; rao , turnshek & nestor 2006 ) , and also to large - scale structure ( williger et al .",
    "although it seems clear that  absorption arises in galaxies of a wide range of morphologies and luminosities ( kacprzak et al .",
    "2007 ) , the majority of the strong systems could be associated with blue , starburst galaxies ( zibetti et al .",
    "2007 ) with high metallicties ( ellison , kewley , & malln - ornelas 2005 ) .",
    "however , none of these identifications tells us where and through which processes the absorption occurs in these galaxies .",
    "if the  occurs in extended halos , the covering factor may be less than unity , so the halos must be patchy ( churchill et al . 2005 ; churchill et al .",
    "2007 ) . indeed ,",
    "this `` patchiness '' may point out to alternative explanations like  systems being the high - redshift analogs of local hvcs ;",
    "i.e. , warm ( @xmath32 k ) , massive ( @xmath33 m@xmath34 ) and compact , pressure - confined clouds embedded in a hot halo but still virialized ( e.g. , maller & bullock 2004 ) , or , alternatively , part of cool galactic outflows ( bouche et al .",
    "2006 [ bmpcw06 ] ) . in any case , and despite a yet unclear origin , there is overall consensus that  flags star - forming regions in a variety of galaxies .    do _ cluster _",
    "galaxies host  absorbers ?",
    "this question motivates the present paper .",
    "cluster galaxy properties are essentially different from field galaxies due to environmental effects . while the general galaxy population shows a wide range of mass , morphology , gas and stellar content , and halo sizes ,",
    "some of these properties have been found to depend strongly on their local galaxy density .",
    "for instance , in the morphology - density relation ( dressler 1980 ) early - type galaxies are concentrated toward the cores of the galaxy clusters , while late - type galaxies are found mainly in the lower density environments ( cluster suburbs or the field ) . similarly , the increasing fraction of blue galaxies in clusters with increasing redshift the butcher - oemler effect ( butcher and oemler 1984) was the first indication that the population of galaxies evolved .",
    "thus , clearly , detecting and studying  absorption in overdense regions like cluster galaxies has a twofold potential .",
    "it provides constraints to fundamental field properties of the absorption systems ( clustering , halo masses , and the absorber - igm connection ) ; on the other hand , it also provides independent clues to galaxy accretion and evolution in clusters , which may become a key complement to radio observations of cold gas in local and low - redshift cluster galaxies ( chung et al .",

    "aim a sample must be built that includes bright quasars ( suitable for high - resolution spectroscopy ) close in projection to and at higher redshifts than the clusters .",
    "we searched for potential quasar - cluster pairs in three ways : ( 1 ) search for known sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) quasars in fields of cluster candidates from the red - sequence cluster survey ( rcs ) ; ( 2 ) search for known or new quasars in fields of clusters from the chandra database ; ( 3 ) search in the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) for quasars close in projection to objects labeled as clusters or groups .    in the search",
    "we have imposed two broad criteria ] : ( 1 ) for each quasar - cluster pair we require @xmath37 , i.e. , the redshifted  doublet may be detected at the cluster redshift , @xmath9 , and is observable from the ground ; and ( 2 ) at @xmath9  the quasar line of sight ( los ) lies within a transverse ( physical ) distance of @xmath38 @xmath5 mpc  of cluster coordinates ( this distance was considered enough to probe well beyond the virial radius ) .",
    "we will refer to these criteria as the `` quasar - cluster '' criteria .",
    "we describe the cross - correlation of cluster candidates from the rcs with quasars from the sdss data release three ( sdss - dr3 ; schneider et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we do not use a later release because most of the extant  statistics were obtained using dr3 data .",
    "the rcs ( gladders & yee 2005 ) is a @xmath39 square degree optical survey conducted at cfht and ctio , aimed at finding galaxy clusters up to redshift of one with some sensitivity to massive clusters to @xmath40 .",
    "this survey has been carried out with observations in two bands , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , to obtain galaxy colors and thus to enhance the contrast between cluster and field galaxies ( gladders & yee 2000 ) .",
    "the main goal of the survey is to measure cosmological parameters through the evolution of the cluster mass function ( gladders et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the clusters have been selected from an overdensity in position , color and magnitude , and their redshifts have been determined from the loci of the red - sequence in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "the redshifts were estimated from simple stellar population codes and then calibrated through the comparison with spectroscopic redshifts for a sample at a wide range of redshifts ( gilbank et al .",
    "masses for the different clusters were determined by using the optical richness measured by the @xmath43 parameter ( yee & ellingson 2003 ) , and the relationship between @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( the mass interior to @xmath45 , where the average mass density is @xmath46 ) in yee & ellingson ( 2003 ; see also gladders et al .",
    "spectroscopy shows that the contamination of the rcs cluster sample , even at @xmath47 , is less than 10% ( gilbank et al .",
    "2007 ; barrientos et al .",
    ", in prep . ) , and",
    "as low as 3% at lower redshifts ( blindert et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "note that the rcs cluster sample we use is an inclusive sample of all rcs cluster candidates with no redshift restrictions ( other than the natural ones imposed by the survey design ) and no richness cuts .",
    "thus , it is likely less clean than the restricted best sample used in the analysis of gladders et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ; however , the inclusion of all candidates maximises possible overlap with the sdss quasar sample .",
    "although covering basically different areas , the cross - correlation of rcs clusters with sdss quasars from dr3 yielded 442 quasar - cluster pairs that met the quasar - cluster criteria ( 113 for @xmath48 @xmath5 mpc  and 36 for @xmath49 @xmath5 mpc ) .",
    "these quasar - cluster pairs are distributed in a common area of @xmath1 square degrees .",

    "[ fig_histo ] shows the transverse - distance and cluster - redshift distributions of the sdss - rcs sample . in the first one we plot the number of pairs found to have a given quasar - cluster distance . to see that this distribution results from a random distribution of clusters and quasars , we calculate the expected distribution ( the stright line in the figure ) defining a mean density as the total number of pairs divided by the area of a circle of radius @xmath50 @xmath5 kpc",
    "this comparison shows that all distances are well represented and that they roughly follow a uniform distribution , which is important for the homogeneity of the survey .",
    "the righthand panel of the figure shows that the redshift distribution of  systems found in sdss quasar spectra ( thin line ; ppb06 ) and that of the sdss - rcs sample have considerable overlap , meaning that our cross - correlation is well suited for searches of  in cluster galaxies .",
    "the sdss - rcs sample of 442 quasar - cluster pairs is composed of 190 quasars and 368 clusters .",
    "therefore , there are on average @xmath51 clusters per los , and @xmath1 % of the clusters are crossed by more than one los .",
    "regarding observability , roughly @xmath52 %  of the quasars are brighter than @xmath53 mag , and @xmath54 % of them are observable from southern facilities .      since both galaxy clusters and quasars are ubiquitous x - ray emitters , using archival chandra observations proved to be a successful way of selecting further targets for our study .",
    "from the chandra database we selected all public observations under the science category ` galaxy clusters ' .",
    "we imposed a maximum declination of @xmath55 degrees , and a chandra exposure time @xmath56 ksec to ensure significant detections of the quasar candidates .",
    "the clusters also had to have a determined redshift above @xmath57 .",
    "a final list of 29 observations that met these criteria were retrieved from the archive .",
    "next , we identified point - like sources in the x - ray data .",
    "we looked for candidate quasars located within a radius of @xmath58 from the cluster central position .",

    "we then searched for optical point - like counterparts to the x - ray sources in sdss images and obtained their @xmath41 and @xmath59 magnitudes from the apm catalog . imposing the criteria @xmath60 and @xmath61 , a total of 49 candidate quasars",

    "we find a median @xmath43 of 327 for an impact parameter of 2 mpc and 258 for the smaller aperture , i.e. , consistent with the larger sample .",

    "both selection effects are expected to increase the a priori hit probability .",

    "these and the arguments given in   [ sect - correlation ] lead us to conclude that the sdss - rcs sample , and thus also sample _ s2-best _ of pairs , is complete and homogeneous , at least at the same level as their parent surveys .",
    "another obvious strength of the quasar - cluster sample is that the search of absorbers in _ s2 _",

    "this is not completely true for _ s1 _ since those quasars were selected for follow - up spectroscopy _",
    "after _ the quasar - cluster selection .",
    "however , at the telescope , the targets were selected without prior knowledge of cluster redshifts ; moreover , even if this had been the case , the low - resolution spectra provided by the sdss do not permit an a priori selection of _ weak _ systems .",
    "therefore , there was no way to prefer quasars with absorbers .",
    "we discuss this further below in the context of absorber statistics .",
    "finally , the following caveat must be mentioned : brighter quasars are chosen for spectroscopy , which might be amplified by gravitational lensing by the absorber host galaxies ( see discussion in   [ sect - discussion ] ) .",
    "surveys of quasar absorption - line systems assess the completeness of the samples via cumulative @xmath243 as a function of rew threshold ( steidel et al . 1992 ) .",
    "since we have _ chosen _ our redshift path to include only spectral regions sensitive to @xmath111  , we consider the sample _",
    "s1 _ of absorbers to be nearly 100% complete .",
    "similarly , we assume that _ s2 _ is statistical in the sense that all  systems with @xmath159   were listed in ppb06 , who argue that their search is @xmath244 % complete .    as for the homogeneity of the samples , we have kept _",

    "s1 _ were selected as having a cluster in the los , and strong systems are readily seen in the sdss spectra . however",
    ", weak systems are not seen in the sdss and we know they do not cluster around stronger systems ( crcv99 ) .",

    "in other words , despite an obvious selection effect toward targets with clusters , _",

    "finally , note that the significance of our result for strong absorbers could increase if a larger cluster redshift path were surveyed .",
    "tables  [ tbl - samples ] and  [ tbl - hits ] show that only roughly @xmath246% of the quasar - cluster pairs results in hits .",

    "the _ weak _ population of  systems ( @xmath157  ) in clusters conform to the field statistics .",
    "the absence of an overdensity is not due to lack of sensitivity .",
    "this effect and the excess of strong systems make @xmath140 appear flatter on a log - log scale , so contrary to the field it can be fitted by a power - law over the whole range of rew .",
    "the most obvious interpretation for the observed overdensity of strong absorbers is that clusters represent a much denser galaxy environment than the field : an overdensity is expected if field and cluster galaxies share the same properties responsible for the absorption .",
    "below we discuss this possibility and then hypothesize on why this trend is seen only for the strong cluster absorbers ( thus producing a flatter rew distribution than in the field ) .",
    "finally , we assess the implications for the fraction of cold gas in galaxy clusters .",

    "[ eq - cosmo ] , @xmath144 is proportional to the average volume overdensity of galaxies in a cluster , @xmath256 . to calculate @xmath256",
    ", we assume that galaxies are spatially distributed in the same way as the dark matter , and therefore adopt a nfw density profile ( navarro , frenk & white , 1997 ) , which depends on the total mass of the cluster of galaxies .",
    "we then calculate @xmath256 within @xmath201 and @xmath245  @xmath5 mpc  from the cluster center , for masses corresponding to the range present in the rcs sample .",
    "given that the los will actually cross different density amplitudes as it passes through a cluster , we simply make an order of magnitude approximation and take half the actual overdensity at the impact parameter .",
    "the number density of galaxies within a cluster of galaxies is obtained assuming a halo occupation number corresponding to a magnitude limit of @xmath257 , which states that the number of galaxies populating dark - matter halos of a given mass is ( cooray 2006 ) @xmath258 whith @xmath259 , @xmath260 , @xmath261 , and @xmath262 .",
    "we then calculate the average density of galaxies above the same magnitude limit by populating all haloes in the millenium simulation ( croton et al .",
    "2006 ) using this same prescription , and then counting the total number of galaxies and dividing this by the total volume of the simulation .",
    "the results for later - type galaxies are displayed in table  [ tbl - galaxy ] .",
    "note that this estimate for @xmath256 includes only the cluster region ; thus , it is to be compared with @xmath263 , i.e. , the overdensity of absorbers after subtracting the field contribution .",
    "if we first concentrate on moderate mass clusters , @xmath264 , which vastly dominate sample _ s2 _ , we see the expected overdensity of cluster galaxies is quite in line with @xmath265 , the observed absorber enhancement , for @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xmath5 mpc  ( using for _ s2 _ fiducial values of @xmath266 and @xmath267 for the two apertures , respectively ; see table  [ tbl - hits ] ) .",
    "in other words , the probability of hitting a  galaxy in a cluster is the same as in the field .",
    "note that this does not imply that quasar los do not see the foreground clusters but rather that this probability scales with galaxy overdensity .",
    "the observed match between @xmath256 and @xmath263 supports the hypothesis that strong absorbers in less masive clusters and in the field share similar properties .",
    "the situation seems different for sample _ s2-best _ , which is dominated by more massive , @xmath268 , clusters .",
    "there we find that the absorber overdensity is enhanced by a factor of @xmath269 with respect to that one in less massive clusters .",
    "on the other hand , from table  [ tbl - galaxy ] we see that the more massive clusters provide a factor of 5 more galaxies than less massive ones .",
    "therefore , the overdensity of galaxies in massive clusters overpredicts the overdensity of strong absorbers by a factor of @xmath270-@xmath271 .",
    "we infer that on average and neglecting other effects , see next section the total cross - section of strong absorbers must be smaller in more massive clusters than in the field by a factor of @xmath51-@xmath271 .    it is tempting to draw conclusions also for @xmath49 @xmath5 mpc , despite the less significant signal observed in the absorber statistics . for both mass ranges ,",
    "the expected overdensity of galaxies increases by a factor of @xmath149 comparing the @xmath160 @xmath5 mpc  and the @xmath272 @xmath5 mpc  apertures . again assuming same properties as in the field , the absorbers statistics fails to reproduce such increase by that same factor of 4 ( since roughly the same @xmath144 is observed for @xmath18 and @xmath49 @xmath5 mpc )",
    "this could indicate the gas cross section is even smaller at distances closer than half mpc to the cluster center ( although the factor @xmath85 is still within @xmath273 confidence limits ) .",
    "although we will present elsewhere a study of gravitational lensing by the cluster galaxies in our sample , this effect deserves a few words here since it may have direct implications for @xmath136 .",
    "we are particularly interested in lensing magnification by the rcs galaxies and the possible bias it may have introduced in the sdss sample used here .",
    "inclusion of magnified quasars in magnitude - limited surveys like the sdss might increase the number of ( lens ) absorbers per unit redshift ( 1997 bartelmann & loeb 1996 ; smette , claeskens & surdej ) .",
    "lensing magnification has been reported not to induce a significant effect on the field statistics of strong  systems ( as observed in sdss quasar spectra ; menard et al .",
    "2007 ) . however , in our case the probability of strong lensing might be greatly enhanced due to not only the quasar light crossing the densest galaxy environments , but also to a possible combination of cluster / quasar redshift ratios of 1:2 that maximizes the probability of strong lensing for @xmath274 ( indeed , that probability is maximal at @xmath275 for @xmath276 ) .",
    "statistical overdensities of bright background quasars ( or paucity of faint quasars ) associated with foreground clusters or large structure have been already detected ( myers et al .",
    "2003 ; scranton et al .",
    "2005 ; but see boyle , fong & shanks 1988 ) .",
    "however , when searching for the lensing galaxies , one finds that the majority of them are early - type ( e.g. , fassnacht et al .",
    "2006 ) which are not expected to host strong  absorbers ( zibetti et al .",
    "we conclude that a great impact of lensing on @xmath144 should not be expected .",
    "nevertheless , if a fraction of these lensing galaxies indeed does act as strong  absorbers , then @xmath136 observed in our sample might be partly due to lensing .",
    "in such a case , the values quoted in   [ overdensity ] for the fractions of cross section that is expected from galaxy counts but not observed in absorption must be seen as upper limits , since they result from a sample that is biased toward more lensing absorbers .",
    "in contrast with strong systems , we do not detect an overdensity of weak absorbers in clusters , although our survey is sensitive enough in the @xmath157   range .",
    "as already stated , this dichotomy induces a flatter , more uniform , rew distribution than what is observed in the field , where weak absorbers have a much steeper distribution than strong absorbers .",
    "does this mean that neither gravitational lensing nor galaxy overdensity influence the weak absorber statistics ?",
    "since lensing magnification is a strong function of  rew ( bartelmann & loeb 1996 ) , @xmath136[@xmath157 ] is perhaps insensitive to lensing .",
    "however , it would be unlikely that also the galaxy excess that clusters represent had no influence on the incidence of the weak absorbers .",
    "this would require a physically distinct population of cluster absorbers , detached from the strong absorbers , that does not scale with galaxy overdensities .    alternatively , since either the absorber number density or filling - factor / cross - section affect the @xmath136 statistics , an interesting possibility is that we have detected the signature of _ processes _ giving rise to  absorption ( gas outflows or extended halos , the two current compelling scenarios ) that are at play in clusters in a different way than in the field .",
    "for instance , if we consider the extended halo hypothesis ( churchill et al .",
    "2005 ) , the low rate of weak  absorbers we observe in clusters might be due to truncated halos due to environmental effects .",
    "such an effect is expected if cluster galaxies lose their gas after a few orbits in processes like galaxy harassment and/or ram pressure stripping ( mayer et al .",
    "2006 ) , and it has actually been observed in 21 cm observations of low - redshift ( giovanelli & haynes 1983 ; chung et al . 2007 ; verheijen et al . 2007 ) and local ( bravo - alfaro et al . 2000 ) clusters .",
    "interestingly , ram pressure affects mostly less - massive galaxies ; on the other hand , according to some authors weaker systems seem to arise in under - luminous , less - massive galaxies ( churchill et al .",
    "2005 ; steidel et al .",
    "all this fits well with the lack of absorbing cross - section observed here for cluster galaxies associated with weak  absorption .",
    "if we instead consider the weak absorbers to be individual , small clouds that are distributed more densely toward the centers of galaxies , then weak  arises in sightlines through the outer parts of a galaxy ( e.g. ellison et al .",
    "this is supported by the typical sizes of strong / weak  which are an order of magnitude different ( ellison et al .",
    "if the strong systems arise in the centers of galaxies , then the cluster environment does not affect them , so that their observed overdensity traces the overdensity of cluster galaxies ( with gas ) .",
    "however , the weak population get destroyed in the cluster environment , and the fact that we do not detect an overdensity for them simply reflects that the field contamination dominates in our redshift path .",
    "our observations allow us to put limits on the shortage of total cross - section for weak systems .",
    "if the flat rew distribution is due to truncated halos , the excess of galaxy counts in table  [ tbl - galaxy ] correspond to the missing fraction in absorbing cross section .",
    "we then conclude that there is between one and two orders of magnitude less total cross - section of  gas having @xmath157 .",
    "several studies have shown that strong ( @xmath196 )  absorbers trace overdense regions .",
    "for example , cooke et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found that damped ly@xmath26  ( dla ) systems cluster like lbgs , which themselves have a non - negligible clustering signal .",
    "dla systems also cluster around quasars ( ellison et al . 2002 ; russell , ellison & benn 2006 ; prochaska , hennawi & herbert - fort 2007 ) , just as galaxies cluster around qsos , and also around themselves possibly revealing large - scale structure ( lopez & ellison 2003 ; ellison & lopez 2002 ) .",
    "more recently , bouche et al . ( 2007 ) have found clustering of strong systems around luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) .    at first glance",
    "our interpretation of gas truncation affecting only weak absorbers seems to go in the opossite direction of the results by bouche et al .",
    "these authors find that lrgs correlate more strongly with weak  systems ( @xmath277  ) than with strong ( @xmath278  ) systems . from their bias ratio they derive absorber masses , and",
    "find that stronger systems occur in galaxies associated with less massive dark - matter halos ( @xmath279 ) than weaker systems ( @xmath280 ) .",
    "the bouche et al .",
    "( 2007 ) data , however , reaches only @xmath281  , while with our technique we probe much deeper in rew .",
    "in fact , from our results it follows just the opposite , namely that the stronger systems correlate more strongly with galaxies : strong systems in our sample show more clustering with clusters than weak systems .",
    "this apparent contradiction becomes even more evident if one considers that lrg should flag clusters .",
    "but , as already stated , @xmath157   systems , might occur in much less massive ( dwarf ) galaxies that were not probed in that study .",
    "certainly a natural follow - up of the present study will be to indentify the absorbing galaxies from the rcs images and look for @xmath282 correlations .    finally , let us note that rew is basically a measure of the velocity spread ( ellison 2006 ) .",
    "one possible contribution to the overdensity of strong systems observed in clusters could be that cluster absorbers have larger spreads due to galaxy interactions , which is much more probable than for the field absorbers .",
    "indeed this effect has been proposed for ultra - strong absorbers ( @xmath283  ; nestor et al .",
    "in addition , a mild correlation between absorber assymetries and rew has been found in the field ( kacprzak et al .",
    "2007 ) that could be strenghtened in our sample due to galaxy interactions .",
    "the few cases in our high - resolution sample _ s1 _ that show resolved systems separated by several 100 km  s@xmath30 , all are weak systems . on the other hand , the few strong systems that are both in _ s1 _ and _ s2 _",
    "do not show particular kinematics when observed at high resolution ( e.g. , velocity spans of several 100 km  s@xmath30 ) .",
    "clearly , a larger sample of strong cluster absorption systems must be analyzed at high spectral resolution .",
    "regardless of what produces the observed overdensity of  in clusters , we can put constraints on the contribution of the absorbing gas to the budget of cold baryons in clusters . with its low ionization potential of @xmath17 ev",
    ",  is a good tracer of neutral gas .",
    "indeed , several surveys have shown that @xmath284   systems frequently occur in dla and sub - dla systems , i.e. , in gas that is predominantly neutral ( rao & turnshek 2000 ; rao , turnshek & nestor 2006 ) .",
    "since ionization corrections are negligible and since column densities in excess of @xmath285 @xmath286  ( the definition threshold of a dla system ) can be obtained easily in low - resolution spectra , measurements of the incidence of dla systems have led to robust estimates of the cosmological mass density of neutral gas , @xmath287 . at low redshift ( @xmath288 ) , where confirmation of the dla troughs at @xmath289   requires space - based observations , rao , turnshek & nestor ( 2006 ) have searched for dla systems using  ( redshifted to optical wavelengths ) as a signpost . by measuring column densities directly , these authors have found that @xmath54%  of systems with @xmath290   are dla systems ( with average column densities @xmath291@xmath292 @xmath286 ) . according to these surveys",
    "( see also rao & turnshek 2000 ) , the mass density provided by dla systems at @xmath293 is similar to the high redshift value , @xmath294 .",
    "for a universal baryon density of @xmath295 ( spergel et al .",
    "2006 ) , @xmath296 % of the baryons in the universe at @xmath297 is in dla systems ( at @xmath298 this fraction falls down to @xmath201% ; zwaan et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "an overabundance of strong  systems of @xmath131 , as observed in our cluster sample , with a 50% chance of being a dla system implies a factor of @xmath299 more neutral gas than the cosmic average .",
    "however , assuming overdensities ( by mass ) of over two orders of magnitude at the typical cluster radii probed here , @xmath45 , yields a tiny 0.1% of the cluster baryons in form of neutral gas .",
    "this small amount of neutral gas seems more consistent with that in present - day groups according to 21 cm surveys ( e.g. , pisano et al .",
    "2007 ; zwaan et al . 2003 ; sparks , carollo , & macchetto 1997 ) . if , as argued for dla systems ( e.g. , wolfe et al . 2004 ) , the neutral gas has served as fuel for star formation , then the small fraction of neutral gas in the rcs clusters probed here may be taken as evidence that star - formation either occurred at much earlier epochs than probed here @xmath300 or it was suppressed by the cluster environment early in the accretion stage .",
    "the flattening of the rew distribution we observe in clusters represents a qualitative difference with the field in terms of absorber populations .",
    "this difference strongly suggests that it is the cluster environment that drives the morphological evolution of cluster galaxies , and not the field population accreted by the clusters . if not",
    ", clusters would be more efficient in accreting strong absorbers , which seems unlikely .",
    "instead , it is more likely that galaxies giving rise to weak absorbers have lost gas due to the cluster environement",
    ".    the differing rew distribution we observe in clusters could be also partly due to a mix of evolutionary and morphological effects .",
    "studies using imaging stacking have shown ( zibetti et al . 2007 ) that strong absorbers arise in bluer , later - type galaxies and weaker systems in red passive galaxies .",
    "if this holds in our sample , it also fits well with our finding of a flat rew - distribution , considering that early - type galaxies in clusters evolve less rapidly than later - type ones ( dressler et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "as already stated , local cluster galaxies show a deficit of  as a function of distance to the cluster centers . already at @xmath301 mpc ,  disks",
    "do not exceed the optical radii ( e.g. , bravo - alfaro et al .",
    "if our sample includes the high - redshift counterparts to these galaxies , the lack of weak  overdensity may indicate that the processes giving rise to the stripping of gas were already in place at @xmath302 . on the other hand , the denser gas ( including molecular gas ; vollmer et al .",
    "2005 ) survives the passages through the cluster center . using the above argument again",
    ", this gas , more internal to the galaxies , may host the strong absorbers we believe track the galaxy overdensities .",
    "we believe the present work opens a couple of important prospects , both from the absorption - line and the host - galaxy perspectives .",
    "first , the high - resolution data can be used to perform further tests for the cluster environment .",
    "are the ionization conditions the same as in field  systems ?",
    "does the kinematics of strong absorbers give any hint of galaxy - galaxy interactions ?",
    "indeed , higher - ionization species such as  and  would perhaps be better suited for such tests ( mulchaey 1996 ) , but they require space - based observations .",
    "secondly , the galaxies giving rise to the observed  in clusters must be identified and their properties compared with the field .",
    "such a comparison should give important clues about the location of field  absorbers .",
    "our experiment can be repeated with rcs-2 , which will provide @xmath303 more clusters , and also better photometric redshifts . with a larger sample",
    "one could study possible evolutionary effects .",
    "for instance , is there an absorption - line equivalent of the butcher - oemler effect ? and , last but not least , the role of gravitational lensing must be further explored , specially its possible effect on the quasar luminosity function of cluster - selected samples .",

    "<S> quasar absorption line systems are redshift - independent sensitive mass tracers . here </S>",

    "<S> the total redshift path from an ad - hoc definition of cluster redshift path is @xmath8@xmath9  @xmath10 and @xmath8@xmath9  @xmath11 for the two samples , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the completeness level to be nearly 100 %  for @xmath12 detection thresholds of @xmath13 and @xmath14   in the two samples , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the results are : ( 1 ) the population of _ strong _  systems ( @xmath15  ) near cluster redshifts shows a significant ( @xmath16 ) overabundance ( up to a factor of @xmath17 ) when compared with the field population ; ( 2 ) the overabundance is more evident at smaller distances ( @xmath18 @xmath5 mpc ) than larger distances ( @xmath19 @xmath5 mpc ) from the cluster center ; and , ( 3 ) the population of _ weak _  systems ( @xmath20  ) near cluster redshifts conform to the field statistics . </S>",
    "<S> unlike in the field , this dichotomy makes @xmath7 in clusters appear flat and well fitted by a power - law in the entire @xmath12-range . </S>",
    "<S> we assess carefully all possible selection and systematic effects , and conclude that the signal is indeed due to the presence of clusters . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a sub - sample of the most massive clusters yields a stronger and still significant signal . since either the absorber number density or filling - factor / cross - section affects the absorber statistics , an interesting possibility is that we have detected the signature of truncated halos due to environmental effects . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we argue that the excess of strong systems is due to a population of absorbers in an overdense galaxy environment , and the lack of weak systems to a different population , that got destroyed in the cluster environment .    finally , comparison with models of galaxy counts show that there is proportionally less cold gas in more massive clusters than in low - mass systems , and two orders of magnitude less  cross - section due to weak systems than due to stronger systems . </S>"
