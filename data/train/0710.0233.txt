    "the qualitative behavior of the presented observable is similar to that for the bistable potential case .",
    "oscillations of the condensate energy are more pronounced for the symmetric potential that is related with higher initial values of @xmath483 .    it was shown that if one vacuum state among a set of vacuum states is fixed , it leads to some specific evolution of the system under action of the mean field .",
    "but there is an open question concerning occupation of other system states due to tunnelling process @xcite .",
    "this problem follows also from our treatment .",
    "this review is mainly based on the results obtained by the authors in the last years and aims to summarize the information about the kinetic description of vacuum particle creation .",
    "the latter results for the inertial mechanism with the time - dependent particle masses are stipulated at the phenomenological level .",
    "three basic quantum field models were considered here : massive scalar , vector and spinor fields . the constructed kinetic theory was applied ( sect .",
    "[ uni ] ) to a conformal cosmology model for investigation of matter created from vacuum in an early period of the universe evolution .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the density of the produced vector bosons is sufficient for explanation of the present - day density of cmb photons .",
    "the obtained results can be used for a subsequent study of different aspects of matter dynamics created from the vacuum in the early universe ( the equation of state , the long wave - length acoustic excitations , the back - reaction problem etc . ) . only the single mechanism of a mass change",
    "was considered where this change is induced by the conformal expansion of the universe whose action is switched on for the mass @xmath484 at some arbitrary initial time @xmath339 . for construction of a more elaborated theory , one should eventually take into account the inflation mechanism of mass generation acting during an earlier period of the universe evolution @xcite .",
    "it would be of interest to consider the generation of particles of different masses and quantum statistics using eq .",
    "( [ mass ] ) which is valid for all particles independently of their inner symmetry .",
    "interesting perspectives are opened up also by results of sect .",
    "[ meta ] , where some simplest quantum field models are investigated for scalar fields with various self - interactions and a corresponding quasiclassical nonstationary field ( the problem of a phase transition at the restoration of broken symmetry , particle tunnelling between states with a different vacua _ etc . _ ) .",
    "certainly , the considered examples do not exhaust all variety of systems , where the vacuum generation of particles is induced by the inertial mechanism .",
    "in particular , a large class of experimentally controlled models of meson and quark subsystems evolved close to a phase transition has remained beyond our scope . in addition , the investigation of two - particle correlations is of interest for description of some delicate experimental effects in nuclear reactions @xcite .",
    "the extension of the mean - field approximation to take into account the back - reaction and collisions is studied intensively with different methods in some scalar models @xcite .",
    "the important problem of relevant initial conditions also attracts attention in the context of heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "we did not worry much concerning relativistic invariant form of the developed formalism : it is an open question.the basis for its solution is the covariant hamiltonian formalism in relativistic kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "finally , some effects discussed here take place also in condensed matter physics and can be interpreted in the conceptual framework of the inertial mechanism ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite and references therein ) .",
