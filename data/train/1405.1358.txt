    "in describing low energy - momentum hadronic phenomena characterized by a scale @xmath12 that is sufficiently small compared with the chiral scale @xmath13 gev , we can eliminate from the lagrangian those degrees of freedom that pertain to scales higher than @xmath14 .",

    ", @xmath15 retains all symmetries of qcd , including ( approximate ) chiral symmetry .",
    "the effective nature of the theory is reflected in the presence of low - energy constants ( lecs ) , which parametrize the high - energy dynamics that has been eliminated ( integrated out ) in generating the low - energy eft .",

    "since @xmath25 , it is a common practice to combine the expansions in @xmath24 and @xmath26 ; thus , @xmath27-th order terms in hb@xmath10pt are those terms with a combined power of @xmath24 and @xmath26 equal to @xmath27 . for review articles , we refer to , _",
