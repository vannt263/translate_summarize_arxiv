    "ultracold atoms have proved to be exceptional many - body quantum systems , thanks especially to their tunable single - particle potentials and multi - particle interactions . the experimental ability in controlling",
    "the parameters of the atomic hamiltonian allow one to simulate and study some of the fundamental aspects of condensed - matter systems , including bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) , bosonic superfluidity , quantum magnetism , many - body spin dynamics , bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluidity , bec - bcs crossover , etc .  @xcite .",
    "in addition , by loading cold atoms into the periodic optical lattice potentials , which are formed by interfering counter - propagating laser beams , it has also been possible to realize hubbard - type lattice models and study strongly - correlated quantum phenomena  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "bosonic atoms in an optical lattice , whose low - energy dynamics is well - captured by the bose - hubbard model  @xcite , provide an ideal platform for the observation of mott insulator ( mi ) and superfluid ( sf ) phases as well as the mi - sf phase transition between the two  @xcite .    meanwhile , recent discoveries of topological insulators  @xcite , topological superconductors  @xcite and quantum spin - hall effect  @xcite have put topological phases of matter on the spotlight .",
    "it turns out that the interaction between the quantum particle s spin and its center - of - mass motion ( momentum ) , i.e. , spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , is at the heart of all of these modern condensed - matter phenomena , and creation and manipulation of a similar ( if not identical ) effect has been an intriguing possibility for the cold - atom community .",
    "however , since quantum gases are charge neutral , they do not directly couple to electromagnetic fields , and this prevented soc studies in atomic systems until to the advent of artificial gauge fields  @xcite . by coupling the internal states of atoms to their momentum via raman dressing of atomic hyperfine states with near - resonant laser beams , it has recently been possible to engineer atomic systems with abelian gauge fields . for instance , while there are many proposals for implementing atomic gases with various non - abelian gauge fields that may give rise to rashba , dresselhaus and weyl socs , several experimental groups have so far achieved only a particular form of an abelian gauge field that may be characterized as an equal rashba and dresselhaus ( erd ) soc  @xcite .",
    "note that a very recent proposal to realize soc in optical lattices does not rely on laser light to couple different spin states  @xcite .",
    "these experiments naturally lead the way to numerous other works on spin - orbit - coupled atomic systems , e.g. , topological superfluid phases of matter , bringing once again the condensed - matter and atomic - physics communities together .    motivated by these developments , here we consider a square lattice in two dimensions and study the effects of both the strength and symmetry of soc and zeeman field on the ground - state phases and phase diagram of the two - component bose - hubbard model .",
    "in particular , based on a variational gutzwiller ansatz , we analyze the competition between the interaction , tunneling , rashba and erd socs , and out - of- and in - plane zeeman fields on the mi - sf phase transition boundary and the nature of the sf phase nearby .",
    "in addition to the phase diagrams , one of our main results is as follows : gutzwiller calculations show that while the magnitudes of the order parameters are uniform across the entire lattice , their phases may vary from site to site due to soc , and therefore , the sf phase is a nonuniform one . we give a complete account and intuitive understanding of this soc induced nonuniform - sf phase and its resultant phase patterns , by supporting our numerical calculations with fully analytical insights .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : tcbhm ] , we introduce the spin - orbit coupled two - component bose - hubbard model , and derive the self - consistency ( total average number , polarization and sf order parameter ) equations using a variational gutzwiller ansatz . our numerical results for the ground - state mi , uniform sf and nonuniform sf phases , and the mi - sf phase transition boundary are presented in sec .",

    "it has long been established that the low - energy dynamics of quantum gases loaded into the periodic optical lattice potentials are well - described by hubbard - type tight - binding lattice models  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the simplest bose - hubbard model  @xcite , which takes into account the chemical potential and nearest - neighbor tunneling of atoms , and short - range ( on - site ) repulsive interparticle interactions , has proved to be quite successful in describing some of the cold - atom experiments where mi and uniform sf phases as well as the mi - sf phase transition were observed  @xcite .",
    "this success generated an enormous interest in this topic , and many extensions of hubbard - type models have not only been proposed but also realized in the recent literature , including different lattice geometries , longer - ranged tunnelings and interactions , multiple components , gauge fields , etc .",
    "a number of theoretical methods have been developed to tackle these lattice models , and among those the validity and limitations of the variational gutzwiller ansatz  @xcite , decoupling mean - field theory  @xcite , strong - coupling expansion  @xcite , and quantum monte carlo  @xcite approaches are well understood .    in this context , the two - component bose - hubbard model  @xcite was introduced about a decade ago to describe cold - atom experiments involving two types of bosons , in which the two components may correspond to different hyperfine states of a particular atom or different species of atoms .",
    "in addition to the phases that are similar in many ways to the mi and sf phases of the single - component model , these works proposed that paired - sf , counterflow - sf , density - wave insulator and supersolid phases may be created with the experimental realization of the two - component model .",
    "these possibilities already motivated a number of experimental studies on two - component systems  @xcite , opening up a new frontier waiting to be explored in the near future .",
    "in addition , excited by the recent realization of spin - orbit - coupled atomic bec  @xcite , there has been growing interest in studying the effects of soc on the two - component model  @xcite .",
    "for instance , it has been proposed that the soc gives rise to rich phase diagrams which exhibit spin textures in the form of spin spirals and vortex and skyrmion crystals within the mi phase  @xcite , and also a nonuniform twisted sf phase  @xcite .",

    "to understand the differences and similarities between these diagrams , first of all , we recall when @xmath222 and @xmath250 that the symmetry between @xmath75 and @xmath243 bosons is broken , and therefore , they do not simultaneously become sf , unless the soc strength is sufficiently strong . in a somewhat similar fashion , we find that increasing @xmath17 from 0 eventually causes simultaneous transition of @xmath75 and @xmath243 bosons to sf , even with a relatively small @xmath283 for our chosen model parameters .",
    "this is because both soc and in - plane zeeman field do not conserve spin , and they couple @xmath75 and @xmath243 bosons .",
    "however , the effects of on - site spin mixing due to @xmath17 is much more stronger than that of the off - site spin mixing due to soc .",

    "[ fig:2]-[fig:4 ] that the sizes of mi lobes shrink as a function of increasing soc strength , which is a result of increased mobility of @xmath6 particles as mentioned in the previous section .",

    "[ fig:3 ] that erd@xmath282 soc has negligible effects .",
    "these findings may explain why the effects of @xmath99 on the ground - state phase diagrams of rashba soc are stronger ( weaker ) than those of erd@xmath44 ( erd@xmath165 ) soc .",
    "this is because while the @xmath17 term competes with the @xmath308 component of the rashba soc for the value of @xmath184 , it does not compete with the @xmath309 component .",
    "therefore , @xmath99 has an intermediate effect on the phase diagrams of the rashba soc .",
    "similar to the erd@xmath282 soc , it should not be surprising that the rashba soc is also competing with the @xmath17 term for the value of @xmath184 , which can again be easily inferred by looking at the two extreme limits .",

    "this discussion shows thet @xmath99 reduces the four - fold degeneracy of @xmath184 to two - fold .",
    "in addition , we also note that @xmath99 breaks the rotational @xmath318-symmetry , and therefore , @xmath167 and @xmath168 are not necessarily equal to each other .",
    "this completes our analysis of in - plane zeeman field on the ground - state phase diagrams , and we are ready to conclude the paper with a brief summary of our results and an outlook .",
    "to conclude , here we considered a square lattice in two dimensions and studied the effects of both the strength and symmetry of soc and zeeman field on the ground - state phases and phase diagram of the two - component bose - hubbard model .",
    "in particular , based on a variational gutzwiller ansatz , we analyzed the competition between the interaction , tunneling , rashba and erd socs , and out - of- and in - plane zeeman fields on the mi - sf phase transition boundary and the nature of the sf phase nearby .",
    "it is already established in the literature that this method is equivalent to the mean - field decoupling theory at least in the absence of a soc , and therefore , it is expected to give qualitatively accurate description of the mi and sf phases .",
    "in addition to the phase diagrams , one of our main results is as follows : gutzwiller calculations showed that while the magnitudes of the order parameters are uniform across the entire lattice , their phases may vary from site to site due to soc , and therefore , the sf phase is a nonuniform one .",
    "we gave a complete account and intuitive understanding of this soc induced nonuniform - sf phase and its resultant phase patterns , by supporting our numerical calculations with fully analytical insights .",
    "one may extend this work in many directions .",
    "for instance , as we emphasized in the main text , recently proposed exotic magnetic phases exhibiting spin textures in the form of spin spirals and vortex and skyrmion crystals inside the mi lobes  @xcite are not accessible within a variational gutzwiller ansatz .",
    "however , there is no a priori reason why the method can not be used to investigate the spin - textured nonuniform - sf phases .",
    "since spin - textured sf phases have only been discussed in the literature for a weakly - interacting bose gas , such studies are especially of interest near the mi - sf phase transition boundary and the strongly - interacting regime .",
    "in addition , sf phases in this work are characterized by the order parameter @xmath319 , and therefore , single - particle and/or single - hole excitations are always gapped inside our mi lobes .",
    "however , this definition of the sf phase does not discriminate the possibility of exotic multi particle and/or hole excitations that may be gapless , our mi lobes may still have some sort of hidden sf orders .",
    "for instance , in the absence of soc and zeeman field , it is already known that a counterflow - sf phase of particle - hole pairs  @xcite characterized by the order parameter @xmath320 and a paired sf phase of two particles or two holes  @xcite characterized by the order parameter @xmath321 are possible when @xmath322 and @xmath323 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the effects of soc and/or zeeman field on the fates of such exotic sf phases is an uncharted territory .",
