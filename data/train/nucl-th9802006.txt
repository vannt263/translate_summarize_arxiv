    "recently , the possibility of the formation of chirally misaligned domains in very high energy collisions of hadrons or heavy nuclei has attracted a lot of interest .",
    "these domains are called disoriented chiral condensates .",
    "a dcc domain is a coherent excitation of the pion fields and corresponds to a local and coherent rotation of the chiral order parameter of the qcd vacuum .",
    "there have been considerable activities in both experimental and theoretical research on dcc .",
    "so far , analyses of high energy heavy ion collisions has focused on central collisions @xcite .",
    "it is because these collisions are thought to be the most effective ones in establishing the conditions required for the chiral phase transition in hadronic matter at high temperature or baryon density .",
    "here we discuss the possible importance of non - central collisions of ultrarelativistic heavy ions for the formation of dcc domains .",
    "the reasons are twofold , as we discuss in the following .",
    "although the possibility of dcc has been pointed out on general grounds @xcite , the only mechanism known to date for the formation of dcc domains is the quench mechanism proposed by rajagopal and wilczek @xcite .",
    "its essence is summarized by the important condition : at some initial moment , the matter must be out of equilibrium .",
    "a way of creating out - of - equilibrium field configurations in isospin space is to proceed through the following two - step process .",
    "1 ) first , create a thermally equilibrated and chirally symmetric phase of matter .",
    "2 ) then , let it cool down rapidly so that the configuration of the chiral fields remains around the symmetric point , while the effective potential favors a state with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry .",
    "central collisions are where the initial conditions are expected to correspond to the highest energy density .",
    "however , at the same time they are where the characteristic time scales are largest , because the heated volume is of maximal size . for the purpose of creating field configurations which are out of equilibrium in isospin space , a smaller time scale for the expansion of the system is better . in this sense ,",
    "central collisions are where the formation of dcc may be less likely . on the other hand ,",
    "it is less probable that chiral symmetry is restored in very peripheral collisions at all .",
    "thus , we conclude that it is quite important to investigate not fully central but also non - peripheral events in the dcc hunt .",
    "ultrarelativistic heavy ions are sources of strong electric and magnetic fields .",
    "when two high energy heavy nuclei collide and the chirally restored phase is created , strong electric and magnetic fields coexist .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the electric and magnetic fields affect the motion of the chiral field through the adler - bell - jackiw anomaly . in the following argument",
    ", we use the linear sigma model whose parameters are the same as those used in ref .",
    "the anomaly gives the following additional term to the effective potential , @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the electromagnetic fine structure constant and pion decay constant , respectively . by using the point charge approximation",
    ", one can express @xmath3 as @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the charge and mass of each colliding nucleus ( we are assuming that identical nuclei are colliding like at rhic ) , respectively , and @xmath7 with impact parameter @xmath8 , and @xmath9 we have taken the collision point as the origin of the coordinate system and the @xmath10 axis as the collision axis in the above expression .",
    "it indicates that the anomaly effect vanishes in very central collisions . in non - central collisions ,",
    "the anomaly effect vanishes on the scattering plane , and @xmath3 has definite signs in the upper and lower half - spaces , and they are opposite with each other .",
    "since the anomaly effect is proportional to @xmath11 and the duration of heavy ion collisions is short at high energies , the change of the average value of the @xmath12 field during a collision is almost negligible and only @xmath13 , the conjugate field of @xmath12 , is changed .",
    "thus , the effect of the anomaly is summarized as a quasi - instantaneous kick to the @xmath13 field which is coherent within the upper and lower half - spaces and takes opposite signs in each half - space @xcite .",
    "to uncover the effect of the anomaly induced kick on the formation of dcc , we have run dynamical simulations of the linear sigma model .",
    "the code is essentially the same as developed in ref .",
    "the details will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we have implemented the effect of the kick in the initial condition on the conjugate field @xmath14 , providing a uniform shift that is opposite in sign in the upper and lower half - spaces with regard to the scattering plane , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a parameter and we have defined the @xmath17 axis to be perpendicular to the scattering plane . in the following calculation , we shall take 0.1 for @xmath16 in order to simulate the situation expected to be realized at rhic and take the quench initial condition defined in ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to concentrate on the effect of the anomaly kick to the time evolution of the system ,",
    "we assume in this paper that the size of the system is infinite in the transverse directions , while we assume longitudinal boost invariance @xcite in the longitudinal direction .",
    "compared to the typical fluctuation of @xmath13 , the effect of the anomaly kick given by eq .",
    "( [ kick ] ) with @xmath18 appears to be completely negligible .",
    "our numerical simulations , however , show that a coherent kick of such a small amplitude has a surprisingly large effect on the time evolution of the @xmath12 field . in figs . 1 and 2",
    ", we show the distribution of the @xmath12 field , whose conjugate is kicked by the anomaly , and @xmath19 field , whose conjugate is not kicked , respectively , at @xmath20 fm in an event .",
    "the initial proper time @xmath21 has been taken to be 1 fm .",
    "we can clearly see the asymmetry in the time evolution of the @xmath12 field between the upper and lower half - spaces , while no such asymmetry is observed in the @xmath19 field .",
    "this tells us that a kick of small magnitude induces a coherent motion of the @xmath12 field .",
    "however , the pion field strengths themselves are not observables .",
    "it is the currents , the vector @xmath22 and axial vector current @xmath23 , that couple to physical observables , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are lorentz and isospin indices , respectively , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are defined as @xmath26 we show in fig .",
    "3 the behavior of @xmath27 and @xmath28 averaged over the upper and lower half - spaces and over 10 events .",
    "this vividly shows that striking coherence in @xmath28 throughout each of the upper and lower half - spaces so that each can be considered as a dcc domain defined by the distribution of @xmath28 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath27 does not show coherent behavior .",
    "neither does @xmath29 nor @xmath30 .",
    "we have confirmed that this is not affected by the finiteness of the system by carrying out simulations with finite transverse dimensions .",
    "we have pointed out , on the basis of two reasons , the importance of semi - central high energy heavy ion collisions in the search for dcc .",
    "first of all , it is required by the quench scenario .",
    "secondly , it is preferred by the chiral anomaly in heavy ion collisions .",
    "@xmath3 takes opposite signs in each side of the scattering plane and couples with the neutral pion field @xmath12 through the chiral @xmath31 anomaly .",
    "its effect can be summarized as a quasi - instantaneous kick to @xmath13 .",
    "its strength appears negligibly small , but our numerical simulations have indicated that the time evolution of the chiral order parameter is such that the anomaly - induced coherence in @xmath12 component is little affected by other field components in spite of their strong coupling at the lagrangian level . @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath28 show definite asymmetry between the upper and lower half - spaces , and are highly coherent within each half - space .",
    "thus , the anomaly induces the formation of dcc domains , which are aligned in space , i.e. , one in the upper half - space and one in the lower half - space , but misaligned in isospin space . because of its definite sign , the spatial asymmetry could serve as an additional experimental signal for the formation of dcc in heavy ion collisions , in the context of an event - by - event analysis with scattering plane identification , which is now experimentally feasible .",
