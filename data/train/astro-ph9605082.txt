    "two of the most constraining observed properties of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are their large luminosities over a broad range of energies ( @xmath1-ray through infrared ) and their rapid variability ( implying a small source size unless the emission is highly beamed ) .",
    "the inferred large energy densities have led to a standard model of the ultimate energy source being the release of gravitational potential energy of matter from an accretion disk surrounding a supermassive black hole ( e.g. , rees 1984 ) .",
    "although this general model has broad support , the specific physical processes that produce the complex , broadband spectral energy distributions ( seds ) observed from agn have not been clearly identified .",
    "it is believed that a mix of processes is important .",
    "the ultraviolet and optical emission may be primary radiation from an accretion disk ( shields 1978 ; malkan & sargent 1982 ; malkan 1983 ) .",
    "in low - luminosity objects starlight will contribute as well .",
    "thermal dust emission is an important ingredient of the infrared band ( barvainis 1987 ; sanders et al .",
    "the high - energy ( x - ray and @xmath1-ray)emission is not well understood .",
    "there are a variety of models for their origin ranging from electromagnetic cascades in an @xmath7 pair plasma ( zdziarski et al .",
    "1990 ) to thermal comptonization models ( haardt & maraschi 1993 ; haardt , maraschi , & ghisellini 1994 ) .",
    "furthermore , gas near the central source may reprocess at least some of the primary radiation via compton scattering , absorption , and fluorescent processes ( guilbert & rees 1988 ; lightman & white 1988 ; george & fabian 1991 ; matt , fabian , & ross 1993 ) .",
    "determination of the mix of physical processes that produce these large , broadband luminosities is a major unresolved issue in agn research , and multi - waveband variability studies are potentially highly constraining .",
    "causality arguments imply that if emission in a ",
    "secondary \" band is produced when photons from a   primary \" band are reprocessed in material near the central engine , then variations in the secondary band could not be seen to lead those in the primary band .",
    "furthermore , if the emission in any given waveband is a combination of two independent components ( with presumably independent variability behavior ) , then measurement of broadband spectral variability might allow them to be separated . finally ,",
    "if a characteristic variability time scale could be measured , it could be compared with those indicative of different physical processes ( e.g. , with the expected viscous , orbital , light - travel time scales ) .    in spite of the potential power of this approach",
    ", it has not until recently been exploited because of the very large amount of telescope time required . in several experiments designed to measure the size of the broad - line region in the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548 , variations at @xmath01400  ",

    "several authors constructed specific models of x - ray illuminated accretion disks to account for the ngc  5548 data ( collin - souffrin 1991 ; rokaki & magnan 1992 ; molendi , maraschi , & stella 1992 ; rokaki , collin - souffrin , & magnan 1993 ) as well as for ngc  4151 ( perola & piro 1994 ) .",
    "a strong test of the idea that the ultraviolet is produced by reprocessing x - ray photons could be made by measuring the time relationship between fluctuations in the ultraviolet and the x - rays , but previous attempts ( e.g. , clavel et al .",

    "the _ rosat _  pspc made a total of 13 observations of ngc  4151 between mjd 22.5 and mjd 28.0 .",
    "although the center points of the first 12 observations were almost evenly spaced ( every 0.5  day ) , the integration times varied from 0.8  ksec to 6.4  ksec . the two soft ( 0.10.4  kev and 0.50.9  kev ) bands , which showed no significant variability during the observations , are apparently dominated by emission from an extended component ( e.g. , elvis et al .",
    "1983 ; morse et al .",
    ". however , the hardest _ rosat _  band ( 12  kev ) showed variations significantly in excess of the measured errors .",
    "the _ rosat _  spectra were well - fitted by a non - variable thermal bremsstrahlung ( @xmath13  kev ) component that contributes most of the flux below 1.4  kev and a heavily absorbed ( @xmath14  @xmath15 ) power - law with fixed slope ( @xmath16 ) and variable normalization ( @xmath17 ph @xmath15 s@xmath18 kev@xmath18 ) that dominates at medium x - ray energies . however , the proportional counter data have low resolution and thus a range of other models can not be ruled out .",
    "the four _ asca _  spectra have higher resolution , allowing more detailed spectral analysis .",
    "these data were compatible with a model that includes warm and cold absorbers , thermal bremsstrahlung , a power - law and a 6.4  kev iron line . again , this is not a unique solution .",
    "the iron line shows significant broadening to the redward wing , suggesting a gravitational redshift that would constrain the material to lie very near the black hole ( yaqoob et al .",
    "the 12  kev _ asca _  data were used in the light curves along with the _ rosat _   points , with a 10% uncertainty added to account for possible calibration differences .",
    "the harder ( 210  kev ) _ asca _  data were not used for variability analysis because only four epochs were obtained .",
    "ngc  4151 was continuously observed with the osse instrument on _ cgro_. the broadband 50150  kev count rate showed weak but significant variability .",
    "the raw data were calibrated by convolving the detector response function with a model assuming a power - law with an exponential cutoff . see paper  iii for further details on the x - ray and @xmath1-ray data .",
    "ngc  4151 was near its historical peak brightness during this campaign .",
    "the average ( absorption - corrected ) flux in the 2 - 10 kev band was @xmath19 .",
    "this is bright compared to the compilation of results from _ exosat _ and _ ginga _ reported in yaqoob et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , which ranged from 0.8 to @xmath20 .",
    "the mean 1275    flux of @xmath21  erg @xmath15 s@xmath18 @xmath18 is higher than the range of @xmath22  erg cm@xmath18 s@xmath18 @xmath18 seen in 19781990 ( edelson , krolik , & pike 1990 ; courvosier & palatini 1992 ) , although the ultraviolet flux was a bit higher during the march 1995 astro-2 campaign ( kriss et al .",
    "during the period mjd 22.532.3 , the light curve of ngc  4151 was densely sampled by _ iue _ , _ rosat _ , _ cgro _ , and ground - based telescopes .",
    "the initial analysis of these data involved comparing fractional variability amplitudes during this period as a function of observing frequency .",
    "the normalized variability amplitude ( nva , or @xmath24 ) was computed as follows . for each band ,",
    "the mean ( @xmath25 ) and standard deviation ( @xmath26 ) of the flux points and the mean error level ( @xmath27 ) were measured . because the nva is intended to be free of instrumental effects , it was determined by subtracting in quadrature the measured mean error from the standard deviation , and then dividing by the mean flux .",
    "that is , @xmath28 note that this is essentially the same procedure used to derive @xmath24 in peterson et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and @xmath29 in edelson ( 1992 ) .",
    "these quantities are given in table  2 , along with the observing band , number of observations ( @xmath30 ) and the difference in days between the first and last observation ( @xmath31 ) during this intensive period .",
    "figure  2 is a plot of nva as a function of observing waveband .",
    "the nva shows a strong dependence on photon energy , increasing from @xmath32% in the optical to @xmath04% in the lwp and @xmath33% in the swp .",
    "the variability in the swp is clearly stronger than at longer wavelengths , but because of the lower variability levels and stronger starlight corrections , it is impossible to say if the optical and lwp have significantly different  non - stellar nvas . \"",
    "this strong wavelength dependence has been seen previously in ngc  4151 and other agn ( e.g. , edelson , krolik & pike 1991 ) , and is suggestive of the superposition of a non - variable soft component that dominates in the optical / infrared and a variable hard component that dominates in the ultraviolet .",
    "the nva also shows interesting behavior at high energies .",
    "the soft _ rosat _  bands show no evidence for any significant variations , with nva formally undefined as the observed variation levels are smaller than the instrumental errors .",
    "the medium energy 1.5  kev x - ray band shows the strongest variability seen in any band , with @xmath34% .",
    "this large difference is apparently due to the superposition of two components : a soft , extended ( and therefore non - variable ) component seen in spectra and hri images ( elvis et al .  1983 ) , and a harder , strongly variable component .",
    "however , this strongly variable component must cut off at some higher energies , because the _ cgro _  data show weaker variability , with @xmath35% in the 50150  kev band .",
    "unfortunately , there are two important energy ranges in which the variability properties of ngc  4151 during this campaign were not measured : the hard x - ray 250  kev gap between _ rosat _  and _ cgro _  ( the 210  kev _ asca _   data can not be used to measure a meaningful nva with only four points ) and the extreme ultraviolet 1200    ( 10 ev ) to 100 ev gap in the mostly unobservable region between _ iue _  and _ rosat_. the former waveband could contain the bulk of the luminosity of the putative primary emission component , and the latter , the bulk of the disk luminosity . these gaps do limit the power of these data ( see   4 ) , although we note that this campaign has produced the most densely sampled grid in time and energy band obtained of any agn to date .",
    "table  2 also gives the monochromatic variable luminosity , defined as @xmath36 .",
    "( @xmath37 is the observed monochromatic luminosity , as defined in   3.5 .",
    ") this parameter behaves somewhat differently than the nva . in particular ,",
    "the medium energy x - rays , which have the strongest nva ( @xmath38% ) actually show the lowest value of @xmath39 ( @xmath40  erg s@xmath18 ) .",
    "note however that the x - rays appear to be heavily absorbed ( @xmath09095% , see   3.5 . ) , so the intrinsic value of this quantity is actually much larger .",
    "these are the most densely sampled ultraviolet observations of any agn obtained to date , allowing examination of the short time scale variability properties .",
    "these data were used to measure the fluctuation power density spectra ( pds ) in four ultraviolet bands ( 1275   , 1330   , 1820   , and 2688   ) , on time scales of @xmath00.25  day .",
    "a regular grid of spacing 0.1  day was created , and the value at each point was taken to be the average of the nearest 12 points , weighted as @xmath41 .",
    "this resampling , which was necessary to mitigate problems introduced by the periodic @xmath00.1  day earth occultation gaps , destroys all information on shorter time scales .",
    "however , as seen below , the pds are dominated by noise on these shorter time scales , so this is not a problem .",
    "only the continuous data were used , and the mean was not subtracted .",
    "these resampled data were used to compute the pds in the four ultraviolet bands , the results of which are shown in figure  3 .    the pds of agn show no discrete features that would indicate periodicity . instead , the fluctuation power is spread out over a wide range of temporal frequencies .",
    "it is common practice to paramterize the pds of agn by the function @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the pds at temporal frequency @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the power - law slope .",
    "these pds have @xmath46 , making them the  reddest \" agn pds yet measured . by comparison ,",
    "the ultraviolet pds of ngc  5548 had a slope @xmath47 on time scales of weeks to months ( krolik et al .",
    "this indicates that the variability power is falling off rapidly at short time scales , and the bulk of the variability power is on time scales of days or longer .",
    "the x - ray pds ngc  4151 has @xmath47 time scales of hours to days and @xmath48 on longer time scales ( papadakis & mchardy 1995 ) . the fact that the ( rather noisy ) x - ray and ultraviolet pds appear to have different slopes over the same range of time scales may indicate that different processes power the variability at the two wavebands , although systematic differences in the data and reduction techniques for the two data sets make direct comparison difficult .",
    "the four pds in figure  3 look similar to within the noise . there",
    "do however appear to be some qualitative differences in the character of variations in different bands that can be discerned by direct examination of the light curves .",
    "in particular , the ultraviolet data give the impression that the most rapid variations occur at the shortest wavelengths , and are somewhat  smeared out \" to longer wavelengths .",
    "( the @xmath00.2  day  spikes \" in the 2688    light curve may be due to instrumental effects . )",
    "a similar effect has been seen at longer time scales in _ hst _ monitoring of ngc  5548 ( korista et al .",
    "such an effect would not be apparent in the above pds analysis .",
    "however , it is unclear how much of this is intrinsic and how much is due to instrumental differences , since the  variability - to - noise \" ratio ( that is , @xmath49 ) , decreases toward longer wavelengths in the ultraviolet , so that this experiment was less sensitive to rapid variations at longer ultraviolet wavelengths .",
    "because there was no measurable interband phase lag ( see   3.4 ) , a slightly different view may be obtained by measuring the zero lag correlations between variations in different wavebands . to investigate this , fluxes in a number of comparison bands (",
    "100  kev , 1.5  kev , 1330   , 1820   , 2688   , and 5125   ) were correlated with the 1275    fluxes . for each of the comparison bands ,",
    "each flux point was paired with the average of the two 1275    flux points measured immediately before and after that point , and 1275    uncertainties were taken to be the average of the uncertainties measured for the two data points .    the results are plotted in figure  4 . the number of points ( @xmath30 ) , linear correlation coefficient ( @xmath50 ) , spearman rank correlation coefficient ( @xmath51 ) , @xmath52-statistic , and y - intercept are tabulated in table  3 .",
    "the 100  kev fluxes ( @xmath53 ) show no correlation with 1275    ( or with any other band for that matter ) .",
    "this could suggest that the processes producing the @xmath1-rays are unrelated to those at work at lower energies , especially given the relatively low nva of the @xmath1-rays .",
    "the data are strongly correlated on these short time scales in all other cases , although the optical and x - ray correlations are a bit marginal , with @xmath54 for 18 points and @xmath55 for 17 points , respectively .",
    "note that perola et al .",
    "( 1986 ) found a similar ultraviolet / x - ray zero lag correlation in previous data over longer ( @xmath01 year ) time scales , although it was claimed that corrrelation broke down at the high flux levels seen in this experiment .",
    "following the regression line to zero flux at 1275    yields a positive excess at all wavebands except 1.5  kev x - rays .",
    "this means that if one would model the flux at each waveband as a combination of a non - variable component and a variable component produced by reprocessing emission from the other waveband , the variable component is always at shorter wavelengths , and the non - variable component becomes a progressively larger fraction of the total flux as the wavelength increases .",
    "the most detailed analysis undertaken with these data was to measure temporal cross - correlation functions between wavebands .",
    "if emission in one band is reprocessed to another without feedback , measurement of an inter - band lag would provide an important confirmation , and indicate which were the primary and secondary bands .",
    "this intensive monitoring of ngc  4151 is clearly better suited for this test than any previous campaign .",
    "unfortunately , even in these data , the 1.5  kev x - rays , which show the strongest variations , are clearly undersampled , as they were observed at a temporal frequency only one - tenth that in the ultraviolet . the differences between the sampling , variability levels , and signal - to - noise ratios in the different wavebands present problems for measuring the interband lag .",
    "below , a detailed analysis is presented of two independent techniques used to measure the interband correlations and lags : the interpolation and discrete correlation functions .",
    "cross - correlation functions were computed using the interpolation cross - correlation function ( iccf ) method of gaskell & sparke ( 1986 ) , as subsequently modified by white & peterson ( 1994 ) .",
    "as described by gaskell & peterson ( 1987 ) , the cross - correlation function was determined by first cross - correlating the real observations from one time series with values interpolated from the second series .",
    "the calculation was then performed a second time , using the real values from the second series and interpolated values from the first series . the final cross - correlation function",
    "was then taken to be the mean of these two calculated functions .",
    "a sampling grid spacing of 0.05  day was used because that is approximately the mean interval between the ultraviolet observations . because the x - ray and optical continuum light curves are much less well - sampled than the ultraviolet light curves , the x - ray and optical cross - correlations with the 1275    ultraviolet light curve were performed by interpolating only in the ultraviolet light curve .",
    "that is , the computed cross - correlation functions are based on the real x - ray and optical points and interpolated ( or regularized ) ultraviolet points , and no interpolation of the x - ray or optical data was performed .",
    "the cross - correlation functions for the various continuum bands were similarly calculated by the @xmath56-transformed discrete correlation function ( zdcf ) method ( alexander 1996 ) , which is related to the discrete correlation function ( dcf ) of edelson & krolik ( 1988 ) .",
    "this method is rather more general than the iccf as ( a ) it does not require any assumptions about the continuum behavior between the actual observations , and ( b ) it is possible to reject data pairs at zero lag ( e.g. , two points in different wavebands , measured from one spectrum ) , and thus avoid false zero lag correlations that might arise from correlated flux errors .",
    "the zdcf differs in a number of ways from the dcf , a notable feature being that the data are binned by equal population rather than into time bins of equal width @xmath57 .",
    "one advantage of this technique is that it allows direct estimation of the uncertainties on the lag without the use of more assumption - dependent monte carlo simulations .",
    "the maximum likelihood error estimate on the position of the true cross - correlation function peak ( @xmath58 ) is a 68% fiducial confidence interval , meaning that it contains the peaks of 68% of the likelihood - weighted population of all possible cross - correlation functions ( alexander 1996 ) .",
    "phrased more loosely , the confidence interval is where 68% of the cross - correlation functions that are consistent with the zdcf points are likely to reach their peaks .",
    "the accuracy of this error estimate is limited by the assumption that the distributions of the true cross - correlation points around the zdcf points are independently gaussian , which is only approximately true , but it does not require any further _ a priori _ assumptions about the nature of the variations or transfer function between bands .      the various columns in table 4 give the results obtained by cross - correlating the specified light curve with the 1275    light curve .",
    "the parameter @xmath59 is the maximum value of the cross - correlation function , which occurs at a lag @xmath60 .",
    "table  4 also gives the centroid of the cross - correlation function @xmath61 , which is based on all points with @xmath62 .",
    "the computed cross - correlation functions are shown in figure  5 ( iccf ) and figure  6 ( zdcf ) .",
    "the measured range of @xmath63 of the various bands with 1275     ( 0.20 to + 0.26 day for the 1.5  kev x - rays , 0.14 to + 0.01 day for 1820   , 0.05 to + 0.22 day for 2688   , 0.78 to 0.53 day for 5125   ) are all consistent with zero measurable lag .",
    "thus , we have assigned conservative upper limits on the lags of 1275     with 1.5  kev of @xmath64  day , with other ultraviolet bands of @xmath65  day , and with 5125    of @xmath66  day .",
    "the physical significance of these limits is discussed in   4 .",
    "figure  7 gives a broadband @xmath1-ray  optical snapshot sed , constructed by combining nearly - simultaneous observations consisting of the wise spectrum taken on mjd 25.6 , _",
    "spectra lwp 26907 and swp 49441 , taken near mjd 26.0 , the _ rosat _  observation centered at mjd 26.0 , and _ asca _  observation number 1 , centered near mjd 26.0 .",
    "because of the weak variability and low signal  to  noise in the @xmath1-ray band , the _ cgro _  spectrum was integrated over the entire campaign to produce the high - energy sed .",
    "additional ( non - simultaneous ) infrared data from edelson , malkan & rieke ( 1987 ) were used in the spectral fits (   4.2 . ) but are not shown in figure  7 .",
    "the data plotted are monochromatic luminosities , @xmath37 , as a function of frequency , @xmath67 .",
    "the quantity @xmath37 is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the flux density and @xmath70  mpc is assumed to be the distance to ngc  4151 ( tully 1989 ) .",
    "the sed of any seyfert 1 galaxy is of course a combination of a number of components , and in particular , we note that starlight from the underlying sab galaxy of ngc  4151 contributes a significant amount of the optical / infrared flux .",
    "peterson et al .  ( 1995 ) estimated that the underlying galaxy produced a flux of 19  mjy at 5125    in the @xmath71 wise aperture , in good agreement with the independent result reached in paper  ii of this series .",
    "this corresponds to approximately 25% of the 5125    flux at the light levels seen in this campaign , so the 5125    nva of the nuclear component ( excluding starlight ) is approximately 1.33 times the observed value quoted in table  2 . for a normal sab galaxy , approximately 42% of the light at 6925   , 31% of the light at 6200  ",
    ", 21% of the light at 4600   , and 4% of the light at 2688    would be due to starlight .",
    "finally , we note one other important feature in the sed : the soft x - rays show significant absorption due to line - of - sight gas intrinsic to ngc  4151 ( evident below 4  kev ) , and in our own galaxy ( evident below 0.3  kev ) .",
    "spectral fits indicate that approximately 9095% of the 12  kev luminosity appears to have been absorbed by gas along the line of sight ( see paper  iii for details ) , although this result is model - dependent .",
    "this would imply that the intrinsic 12  kev luminosity is 1020 times that observed .",
    "possible sources of the intrinsic absorption include partial covering by cold gas ( e.g. , holt et al .",
    "1980 ; yaqoob , warwick & pounds 1989 ; yaqoob et al .",
    "1993 ) or absorption in a warm , ionized medium ( weaver et al .",
    "1994a , b ; warwick , done & smith 1996 ) . similar behavior has been seen in the sed of ngc  3783 obtained during the  world astronomy day \" campaign ( alloin et al .",
    "1995 ) . a smaller fraction ( @xmath035% ) of the 210  kev flux",
    "is apparently absorbed , but unfortunately , the data are inadequate to characterize the variability in this band .",
    "ngc  4151 was monitored intensively with _",
    "iue _ , _ rosat",
    "_ , _ asca _ , _ cgro _  and ground - based optical telescopes for @xmath010 days in december 1993 .",
    "these observations provided the most intensively sampled multi - wavelength light curve of an agn to date .",
    "the major new observational results are as follows :    1 .",
    "ngc  4151 showed strong variability from the optical through @xmath1-ray bands during this period .",
    "the optical / ultraviolet / x - ray light curves are similar but not identical , with no detectable lags between variations in the different bands .",
    "the upper limits on the lags are , between 1275    and 1.5  kev , @xmath20.3 day ; between 1275    and 5125   , @xmath21  day ; and between 1275    and the other ultraviolet bands , @xmath20.15  day .",
    "the 100  kev variations are not clearly related to those in any other band .",
    "the strongest variability was seen in the medium energy x - rays , with the 12  kev band showing an nva of 24% .",
    "the variations were systematically weaker at lower energies , with nvas of 9% , 5% , 4% and 0.5% at 1275   , 1820   , 2688    and 5125   , respectively .",
    "however , the 100  kev light curve showed an nva of only 6% , and the soft ( @xmath721  kev ) x - rays showed no detectable variability .",
    "the observed luminosity ( as opposed to fractional ) variability was seen to be lowest in the 1.5  kev band , apparently due to strong x - ray absorption along the line of sight .",
    "the pds of all four ultraviolet bands are similar , showing no evidence for periodicity , but is instead being well modeled as a power - law with @xmath73 .",
    "the broadband sed shows a strong deficit in the soft / mid - x - ray , which is well - fitted as a factor of @xmath015 absorption by gas on the line - of - sight .",
    "finally , the character of the multi - wavelength variability in the seyfert  1 ngc  4151 appears to differ markedly from the only other agn monitored with similar intensity .",
    "the bl lac object pks  2155304 was observed continually for @xmath03 days at ultraviolet ( urry et al .",
    "1993 ) , x - ray ( brinkmann et al .  1994 ) , and optical ( courvoisier et al .",
    "1995 ) wavebands .",
    "multi - wavelength analysis by edelson et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found that the x - ray , ultraviolet and optical variations were almost identical in amplitude and shape , but that the x - ray variations led those in the ultraviolet and optical by @xmath023  hr .",
    "for these observations of ngc  4151 , and other seyfert  1s observed over longer time scales ( e.g. , clavel et al .",
    "1991 ) , the light curves do show significant differences between wavebands , with nva a strong function of energy , but no lag has been measured between variations at different bands .",
    "this is an observed ( and therefore model - independent ) example of an intrinsic difference between seyfert  1s and bl lacs .",
    "these results have important implications for models that attempt to explain the ultraviolet emission from agn .",
    "there are currently two broad classes of such models .",
    "the first hypothesizes that the bulk of the ultraviolet luminosity is produced internally by viscosity in the inner regions of an accretion disk surrounding a central black hole , and the second , that the observed ultraviolet emission is produced in gas illuminated and heated by the source that we observe at high energies . of course",
    ", the true picture could be a combination of these processes , a hybrid in which both intrinsic emission from an accretion disk and reprocessing of x - ray emission are important ( and , indeed , may feed back upon each other ) , or conversely , it may be that neither of these models is relevant .",
    "although the specific processes responsible for agn emission have not been clearly identified , there is broad support for the general model of a black hole and accretion disk ( see   1 ) . in this model",
    ", the emission from normal ( non - blazar , radio - quiet ) seyfert  1s like ngc  4151 is relatively isotropic , not significantly doppler - boosted or beamed towards earth . in this case , it is possible to use variability to place relatively model - independent limits on the central black hole mass ( and therefore the size scale ) .",
    "the most general is the eddington limit , which requires only that the source be gravitationally bound and possess a high degree of spherical symmetry .",
    "the minimum central mass given by this limit is @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the eddington luminosity and mass , @xmath77 is the thompson cross - section , and @xmath78 is the proton mass . as the integrated luminosity of ngc  4151 is @xmath79  erg s@xmath18 ,",
    "the eddington mass is @xmath80 .    for a source surrounding a black hole of mass @xmath81 , and schwarzschild radius @xmath82",
    ", the minimum variability time scale ( @xmath83 ) can be estimated from the size ( @xmath84 ) of the smallest stable orbit , which is @xmath85 for a schwarzschild black hole . for @xmath86 ,",
    "this implies @xmath87  cm or @xmath88  sec , which is not a significant constraint on data which were sampled every hour .",
    "a larger but more model - dependent constraint assumes keplerian orbits and uses the correlation between the widths of emission lines and the distances estimated from their lags to estimate the central mass . in the form in which this estimate is generally presented , the inferred mass is the true mass if the clouds travel on circular orbits . if the clouds are gravitationally bound , but non - gravitational forces ( e.g. radiation pressure or hydrodynamics ) affect cloud motions , the real mass is greater than this estimate ; if the motions are unbound , the real mass is smaller than this estimate .",
    "clavel et al .",
    "( 1987 , 1990 ) used this method to derive a central mass of @xmath89 for ngc  4151 .",
    "this corresponds to a smallest stable orbit of @xmath90  lt - min .",
    "again , this relatively weak constraint is not significant for these data .",
    "if the ultraviolet / optical continuum is optically thick thermal emission , the variability amplitudes can be used to constrain the temperature distribution .",
    "the simplest non - trivial general case is a flat , azimuthally symmetric disk with a local blackbody temperature that drops with radius as some power - law : @xmath91 .",
    "when @xmath8 is 3/4 , this is a fair approximation of a standard accretion disk , except at the smallest radii .",
    "by contrast , in a disk that radiates predominantly by reprocessed energy ( see   4.3 . ) , @xmath8 can be smaller , depending on the geometry of both the disk and the source of the primary radiation .",
    "if the local emission is described by a blackbody , the contribution of an annulus to the total disk flux density at a given frequency @xmath67 is @xmath92 where @xmath93 , and the starting and ending points of the integral are defined by the temperatures at the inner and outer radii of the ring .",
    "the increasing amplitude of variations with observing frequency is then naturally attributed to changing emission from the hotter regions ( that is , the inner disk radii ) .",
    "there is a test of the simplest case that produces simultaneous multi - wavelength variations , in which the emission from the outer disk ( @xmath94 ) is constant , and all of the variability is produced by a complete , simultaneous modulation of the emission from the inner disk ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "the only free parameter is the radius that separates the variable and constant parts of the disk , and this can be determined from the nva at a single wavelength .",
    "for example , using the 1275    variability amplitude of 8.6% gives @xmath96 for @xmath97 or @xmath98 for @xmath99 .",
    "this corresponds to a boundary at the disk radius where the temperature is 215,000 or 78,000 k , respectively .",
    "the last two columns of table  2 show how the percentage flux would drop if all of the emission inside this radius ( the putative variable component ) went to zero , including the effects of starlight .",
    "there is good agreement between the simple thermal model and the observed wavelength dependence of the variability amplitude for the standard accretion disk case , @xmath100 .",
    "this is not a strong function of how the inner boundary is chosen ; for the @xmath99 case , truncating the integration to between @xmath101 and @xmath98 changes the result by only 20% .    the success of this simple exercise motivated the fitting of the ultraviolet / optical sed with a standard model of a geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disk ( e.g. , following the formalism of sun & malkan 1989 ) .",
    "aside from the starlight , no additional long - wavelength component was included in the models , so no attempt was made to fit fluxes longward of 2  @xmath102 m .",
    "if the disk is assumed to be viewed face - on , and the black hole is spinning rapidly ( kerr metric ) , the best - fit model parameters are @xmath103 and @xmath104 yr@xmath18 . if on the other hand the black hole is assumed stationary ( schwarzschild case ) , the best - fit parameters are @xmath105 and @xmath106 yr@xmath18 . in either case , the accretion rate corresponds to 0.6% of the eddington rate .",
    "the black hole mass inferred from the schwarzschild fit agrees with the keplarian value obtained by clavel et al .",
    "( 1987 , 1990 ) .",
    "these fits give higher weight to the higher signal - to - noise optical continuum than to the ultraviolet continuum where the disk light dominates , which in turn requires a hotter disk and consequently a lower black hole mass ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "all the disk fits would give significantly larger black hole masses if the disk had a non - zero inclination .    integrating the multi - waveband disk emission out to a boundary radius of @xmath108",
    "lt - day shows that approximately 30% , 20% and 5% of the total disk flux at 1275   , 2688   , and 5125    is produced in the inner disk .",
    "( these numbers refer to the kerr model , but are not very model - dependent ; malkan 1991 . ) after correcting for the effects of galactic starlight in the @xmath109 aperture , the 5125    emission from the inner disk falls to @xmath04% . for @xmath110",
    ", this radius corresponds to @xmath111 these fractions are approximately the same as the largest peak - to - peak variations observed in these bands during the intensive 10 day multi - waveband monitoring campaign .",
    "thus , one consistent explanation for the decline in variability with increasing wavelength is that the variations occur entirely inside the inner disk . at a distance @xmath112",
    "lt - day from a @xmath113 black hole , the orbital time scale is @xmath01  day , whereas the dominant fluctuations clearly occur on longer time scales ( i.e. , the 1275  peak - to - peak variation was only 42% over the entire 10 day intensive campaign ) .",
    "thus , they could be associated with either orbital mechanics or thermal fluctuations in the inner disk .",
    "it must also be noted that this simple disk model does not produce any x - ray emission , although this is also likely to originate within the inner regions .",
    "these data also can be used to constrain models in which the ultraviolet radiation is produced in gas that is heated by the same x - ray continuum that we observe directly at higher energies . in this model ,",
    "time variations in the ultraviolet and high energy fluxes should be closely coupled : the ultraviolet becomes stronger shortly after the high energy flux rises , and the high energy flux may itself respond to changes in the ultraviolet flux if the ultraviolet photons provide seeds for compton upscattering into the higher energy band .",
    "the delays in both cases are essentially due to the light travel time between the two source regions .",
    "consequently , the ( reprocessed ) ultraviolet emission should vary simultaneously with the ( primary ) x - rays on time scales longer than the round - trip light - travel time between the emitting regions ( e.g. , clavel et al .",
    "the strong correlation between the ultraviolet and x - ray variations therefore supports the reprocessing hypothesis .",
    "the lack of any lag within the ultraviolet could be explained in two ways : either the sub - regions responsible for variations in different wavelengths are likewise very close to each other , or , as with the accretion disk model , only the hottest part of the region is varying . in the context of this model",
    ", the lack of any detectable lag implies that the x - ray and ultraviolet emitting regions are separated by @xmath20.15  lt - day , ( @xmath114  lt - day , because the light must travel in both directions ) , so the bulk of the reprocessing must occur in the central regions .",
    "perola & piro ( 1994 ) applied a more detailed reprocessing model to earlier x - ray / ultraviolet observations and predicted that high time resolution monitoring would measure lags of order 0.030.1  day ( rather close to but still formally consistent with the measured limits of @xmath20.150.3  day ) .",
    "the reprocessing model is supported by the broad profile of the iron k@xmath8 line , which suggests relativistic effects associated with an origin very close to a central black hole ( yaqoob et al .",
    "however , the _ asca _  observations ( and previous medium x - ray observations ) found no evidence for any significant  hard tail \" in the x - ray spectrum ( paper iii ; maisack & yaqoob 1991 ) .",
    "while the presence of the iron line implies reprocessing by some material , the lack of a `` reflection hump '' suggests that the material is not optically thick to compton scattering , as would be expected in the putative reprocessing disk .",
    "an associated problem is the overall energy budget .",
    "the total x - ray/@xmath1-ray flux must be adequate to produce the observed ultraviolet / optical / infrared flux , and the variable high energy flux must also equal or exceed that at lower energies .",
    "the observed , integrated 0.11  @xmath102 m flux is @xmath115 erg @xmath15 s@xmath18 . as strong ly@xmath8 and c  iv emission indicates that the ultraviolet bump extends to wavelengths substantially shorter than 1000   , the intrinsic",
    ", integrated flux is probably larger by a factor of @xmath03 , corresponding to a total ultraviolet / optical / infrared flux of order @xmath116 erg @xmath15 s@xmath18 .",
    "the observed , integrated 12  kev and 210  kev fluxes are @xmath117 erg @xmath15 s@xmath18 and @xmath118 erg @xmath15 s@xmath18 , respectively after correction for line - of - sight absorption ( which is particularly important at 12  kev ) , the intrinsic , integrated fluxes rise to @xmath119 erg @xmath15 s@xmath18 and @xmath120 erg @xmath15 s@xmath18 , for a total of @xmath121 erg @xmath15 s@xmath18 .",
    "this is not adequate to power the lower energies , but inclusion of the gro data and interpolating between asca and gro yields a ( rather uncertain ) integrated 1200  kev flux of order @xmath122 erg @xmath15 s@xmath18 .",
    "this would be of order the amount necessary to power the lower energies .",
    "however , the fact that the @xmath1-ray variations differ from those in all other wavebands suggests that the bulk of the 10200  kev emission ( which dominates the x - ray/@xmath1-ray flux ) arises in a component that does not fully participate in the reprocessing . in this case",
    ", the x - ray/@xmath1-ray luminosity would still be a factor of order @xmath03 too small , so at most @xmath01/3 of the observed infrared / optical / ultraviolet flux could be due to reprocessing .",
    "however , this can not be independently verified because the _ asca _  sampling above 2  kev is inadequate to characterize the variability , and indeed the entire 10 - 50  kev spectrum is interpolated , not observed .",
    "although the absolute x - ray luminosity changes are observed to be small compared to those in the ultraviolet / optical , spectral fits indicate that the x - rays are highly ( factor of @xmath01520 ) absorbed , and the intrinsic , absorption - corrected variations have more than enough power to drive the ultraviolet / optical variations . however , the nva , which measures the fractional ( as opposed to absolute ) variations is 24% in the x - rays , while it is only 9% , 5% , 4% , and 1% at 1275   , 1820   , 2688   , and 5125   , respectively .",
    "this indicates that at most 35% , 20% , 15% , and 4% of the emission at 1275   , 1820   , 2688   , and 5125    could be due to reprocessing , with the rest coming from a component with different ( slower ) variability . as with the previous analysis",
    ", this would indicate that at most @xmath01/3 of the ultraviolet / optical / infrared can be reprocessed emission from higher energies .      1 .",
    "ngc  4151 showed significant variability over time scales of days , so the emitting region must be smaller than of order a few light days across , assuming the emission is not beamed .",
    "the limits on the interband lags indicate that , if there is reprocessing of flux between bands , none of the emission regions could be larger than @xmath00.15  lt - day .",
    "the lower limit to the central black hole mass derived from the eddington limit is small ( @xmath123 ) , corresponding to a minimum variability time of only 10 sec , which is not a significant constraint .",
    "accretion disk fits to the sed yield a central black hole with a mass of @xmath124 , accreting well below the eddington limit .",
    "the fact that the low nvas decrease from medium energy x - ray to ultraviolet to optical wavebands is consistent with the accretion disk model if the bulk of the variable ultraviolet / optical emission originates in a region @xmath00.07  lt - day ( @xmath125 ) from the center .",
    "this model gives is no immediate explanation of the link between ultraviolet and x - ray variations .",
    "the reprocessing model predicts a strong correlation between ultraviolet and x - ray variability , which is observed . because the nvas become systematically smaller at longer wavelengths , and because the absorption corrected x - ray/@xmath1-ray luminosity is only much smaller than in the ultraviolet / optical / infrared , and at most @xmath01/3 of the lower energy emission could be produced by reprocessing .",
    "this suggests that perhaps the ultraviolet arises in a disk powered partially by illumination by an x - ray source and partially by internal viscosity and accretion .",
    "determining the exact mix of these emission components will require probing the ultraviolet / x - ray bands at the shortest accessible time scales .",
    "it is of particular importance to extend the coverage to the gap at x - ray energies harder than 2  kev .",
    "this is the goal of the upcoming coordinated _",
    "xte / iue_/ground - based observations of ngc  7469 , scheduled for the middle of 1996 , and it is hoped that they will shed further light on this important question .",

    "<S> this paper combines data from the three preceding papers in order to analyze the multi - waveband variability and spectral energy distribution of the seyfert  1 galaxy ngc  4151 during the december 1993 monitoring campaign . </S>",
    "<S> the source , which was near its peak historical brightness , showed strong , correlated variability at x - ray , ultraviolet , and optical wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> the strongest variations were seen in medium energy ( @xmath01.5  kev ) x - rays , with a normalized variability amplitude ( nva ) of 24% . </S>",
    "<S> weaker ( nva = 6% ) variations ( uncorrelated with those at lower energies ) were seen at soft @xmath1-ray energies of @xmath0100  kev . </S>",
    "<S> no significant variability was seen in softer ( 0.11  kev ) x - ray bands . in the ultraviolet / optical regime , </S>",
    "<S> the nva decreased from 9% to 1% as the wavelength increased from 1275    to 6900   . </S>",
    "<S> these data do not probe extreme ultraviolet ( 1200    to 0.1  kev ) or hard x - ray ( 250  kev ) variability . </S>",
    "<S> the phase differences between variations in different bands were consistent with zero lag , with upper limits of @xmath20.15  day between 1275    and the other ultraviolet bands , @xmath20.3  day between 1275    and 1.5  kev , and @xmath21  day between 1275    and 5125   . </S>",
    "<S> these tight limits represent more than an order of magnitude improvement over those determined in previous multi - waveband agn monitoring campaigns . </S>",
    "<S> the ultraviolet fluctuation power spectra showed no evidence for periodicity , but were instead well - fitted with a very steep , red power - law ( @xmath3 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> if photons emitted at a  primary \" waveband are absorbed by nearby material and  reprocessed \" to produce emission at a secondary waveband , causality arguments require that variations in the secondary band follow those in the primary band . the tight interband correlation and limits on the ultraviolet and medium energy x - ray lags </S>",
    "<S> indicate that the reprocessing region is smaller than @xmath00.15  lt - day in size . after correcting for strong ( factor of @xmath415 ) line of sight absorption </S>",
    "<S> , the medium energy x - ray luminosity variations appear adequate to drive the ultraviolet / optical variations . </S>",
    "<S> however , the medium energy x - ray nva is 24 times that in the ultraviolet , and the single - epoch , absorption - corrected x - ray/@xmath1-ray luminosity is only about 1/3 that of the ultraviolet / optical / infrared , suggesting that at most @xmath01/3 of the total low - energy flux could be reprocessed high - energy emission .    </S>",
    "<S> the strong wavelength dependence of the ultraviolet nvas is consistent with an origin in an accretion disk , with the variable emission coming from the hotter inner regions and non - variable emission from the cooler outer regions . </S>",
    "<S> these data , when combined with the results of disk fits , indicate a boundary between these regions near a radius of order @xmath5  lt - day . </S>",
    "<S> no interband lag would be expected as reprocessing ( and thus propagation between regions ) need not occur , and the orbital time scale of @xmath01  day is consistent with the observed variability time scale . </S>",
    "<S> however , such a model does not immediately explain the good correlation between ultraviolet and x - ray variations .    </S>",
