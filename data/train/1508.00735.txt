    "among methods allowing for hyperthermia in biological tissues , that based on the radiofrequency ( rf ) absorption by gold nanoparticles ( gnps ) got in the last years much attention , due to its important advantage  a deep penetration of the rf radiation into biological tissue ( @xmath130  cm at frequencies @xmath110  mhz ) .",
    "details and useful references can be found in the review by @xcite .",
    "@xcite in their experiments carried out at 13.56  mhz revealed that the heating rate ( hr ) depends on the particle size , namely that smaller particles are heated faster , presumably because of their higher resistivity .",
    "however , the exact physical basis of heat generation by nanoparticles remained so far unclarified .",
    "this is a serious obstacle for grasping the hr / particle size relation and hence for making `` intelligent choice '' of the gnp size , tailored to the particular use .",
    "for example , one may wish to assure an enhanced specific absorption rate ( sar ) to heat the gnp to necessary temperatures at minimum released power , avoiding at the same time an unnecessary heating of normal tissues during hyperthermia .",
    "according to standard definition , sar = @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the specific heat and @xmath4 is the hr ( temperature / time ) .",
    "the size dependence of the hr for the gnps used by @xcite is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_01 ] .",
    "as is seen , the hr attains maximal values , among the nanoparticles studied , in the smallest ones , of the 5  nm size .",
    "along with @xcite , also the observations of @xcite imply that the smaller the size of gnps ( for a given volume fraction of gold ) , the higher their hr : among experimentally studied gnps with diverse sizes , those of @xmath15  nm diameter exhibit the highest one .",
    "@xcite strengthened this conclusion , having stated that the gnps only of size 10  nm or less could be heated by the electromagnetic rf field ( again , the highest experimentally observed hr corresponded to the gnps of 5  nm diameter ) .    in this paper , a physical model of the size effect in heat generation and reduction of heat generation in aggregated gnps",
    "is proposed , in which the longitudinal acoustic vibrational modes ( lavms ) play an important role .",
    "none of the theoretical models reviewed critically by @xcite took these latter into account , whereas we will show that the inclusion of acoustic modes enables to explain a number of experimental results .",
    "besides , our findings make it possible to obtain an optimal size of gnps providing maximum sar .",
    "the manuscript is organised as follows .",
    "[ sec:2 ] shows that in large gnps ( of the diameter exceeding 162  nm ) the heating by rf radiation is possible owing to uncertainty in the fermi electron s momentum ; however , the use of this mechanism in hyperthermia can not be but very limited .",
    "for practical treatment , much smaller gnps need to be  and indeed are  used , revealing a pronounced size dependence of the heating efficiency .",
    "possible physical foundations of the related heating mechanism , along with explanation of the observed size effect , are discussed in sec .",

    "[ sec:4 ] , on the basis of conclusions drawn from sec .",

    "the general discussion of results is offered in sec .",
    "[ sec:6 ] , and the conclusion drawn in sec .",
    "[ sec:7 ] .",
    "first we discuss an issue of whether the phonons are at all needed for the rf absorption , and what are the conditions for the latter to happen in a `` conventional '' way .",
    "the key feature in absorption of electromagnetic waves by nanoparticles is quantization of energy levels , which become denser as the particle size increases .",
    "satisfying the conditions of conservation of both energy and momentum on absorption is not , _ a priori _ , possible without additional considerations , because the curvature / slope of dispersion relations are very different for electrons and photons .",
    "we consider first the case when no other players enter the picture , and assume the matching conditions to be satisfied within the uncertainty relation .",
    "to be specific , we take the gnp to be spherical , of diameter @xmath5 ; the rf of 13.56  mhz , like in the above experiment , corresponds to photon energy @xmath6  ev and momentum @xmath7  g@xmath8cm@xmath8s@xmath10 .",
    "the skin depth in gold at 13.56  mhz is about 20  @xmath11 m , i.e. , by orders of magnitude exceeding the gnp size .",
    "one can therefore assume that the electric field penetrates the volume and is of the same strength throughout the particle .    in metal particles as small as @xmath15",
    "nm , and even for much larger ones , the quantization ( discreteness ) of the electron energy spectrum is a crucial factor shaping their properties . speaking specifically about gold",
    ", one can advance far enough on the basis of the free - electron model , assuming one electron per atom and estimating the corresponding fermi energy .",
    "assume that the absorption happens due to transitions between discrete levels induced by quantum confinement ; the free - electron dispersion relation @xmath12 implies that the energy step @xmath13 must be accompanied by the correction of momentum , @xmath14 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_02 ] ) . for the relevant values of @xmath6  ev and the fermi velocity of gold as in the free - electron model ( @xmath15  m@xmath8s@xmath10 ) ,",
    "the momentum mismatch amounts to @xmath16  g@xmath8cm@xmath8s@xmath10 , two orders of magnitude larger than what the photon momentum ( see above ) could bring about .",
    "however , the small size of gnp may result in appreciable heisenberg s uncertainty of electron momenta in them and thus `` smear out '' the discussed mismatch condition .",
    "let us make some estimates to this end .",
    "following the pioneering works by @xcite , we remind a relationship between the diameter @xmath5 and the level spacing @xmath17 .",
    "assume that the electron energy level @xmath18 is the first vacant one above the fermi level @xmath19 .",

    "now , we turn to the momentum uncertainty arguments and assume for simplicity that the direction along the nanoparticle s diameter is collinear with the momentum @xmath33 and the fermi electron s momentum @xmath34 .",
    "then the uncertainty in the fermi electron s momentum in this direction equals @xmath35 . at @xmath32",

    "consequently , the momentum conservation law can be helped by such uncertainty , and the rf photon absorbed .",
    "we keep in mind , however , that the minimal gnp size for the direct rf absorption must be at least @xmath37162.1  nm . obviously as the particle size grows , the distance between quantified levels shrinks , so that an absorption of a given photon @xmath38 may bring about an excitation across @xmath24 ( an integer number ) interlevel distances .",
    "this situation is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_03 ] , which implies a parabolic dispersion law @xmath12 for different confinements ( particle sizes ) , in arbitrary scale .",
    "the effect of the momentum uncertainty is indicated by dots of different widths placed at the initial and final levels .",
    "some numerical estimates for the energy spacings and momentum uncertainties , relevant for the absorption of quanta at @xmath39  mhz ( @xmath38 = 5.6@xmath810@xmath40  mev ) are summarized in table  [ tab:1 ] .",

    "thus , the momentum conservation law can be fulfilled , and the 13.56  mhz photons absorbed , for gnps larger than @xmath1162  nm .",
    "consequently the latter , as it seems , can apparently be rf - heated `` directly '' , i.e. , without involvement of lavms , just by exciting the fermi electrons to the available energy levels above the fermi level . on the contrary , in gnps smaller than @xmath1162",
    "nm the separation between adjacent levels exceeds the energy of the rf quantum , and at `` working '' particle sizes which in fact show an enhanced absorption ( @xmath15  nm ) the level splitting becomes prohibitively large .",
    "an involvement of many photons in a single electron excitation is likely to be a very rare process .",
    "therefore , we have to bring another physical mechanism into consideration .",
    "longitudinal acoustic phonons seem to be able to intervene with energies of the `` correct '' order of magnitude .",

    "the observed size dependence of the hr can be explained by a mechanism of the gnps heating that attributes a crucial role in the absorption of a rf photon to lavm . to make reliable estimates , we need to know something about elastic properties of nanoparticles . a theoretical work by d.y .",

    "experimentally , j.  @xcite have recently found that ag nanoparticles can be deformed like liquid droplets but remain highly crystalline in the interior .    as was already admitted above",

    "is that the electrons are driven by , or themselves contribute to , the fluctuating electric field due to compression / dilation of the electron density in the course of lattice vibrations .",
    "obviously , only the longitudinal vibration mode can be `` useful '' in this sense .",

    "a fermi electron may absorb the energies of both the rf photon and the lavm .",
    "[ fig_04 ] shows how an inclusion of momentum @xmath54 and energy @xmath55 of such lavm ( @xmath56 numbers the energy steps in the vibration modes ) into the combined absorption makes possible to satisfy both conservation laws . in the absorption event , the gnp borrows energy from its lavms system",

    "zharov and co - workers @xcite , aiming to prevent metastasis , used magnetic trapping of tumour cells circulating in the bloodstream with their simultaneous photoacoustic and photothermal detection .",
    "to this end , the gold - plated carbon nanotubes were employed .",
    "as it seems , the use of the @xmath300  nm diameter gnps instead of gold - plated carbon nanotubes may help to extend this method over applications in the rf range as well .",
    "a recent work by @xcite describes a promising so - called `` quantum rattle '' , that is , a hollow spherical particle ( @xmath307  nm of total diameter ) with mesoporous silica shell ( @xmath308  nm thickness ) hosting both gold quantum dots ( auqds ) of @xmath309  nm diameter and gnps ( average crystallite size 7.3  nm in diameter ) .",
    "the quantum rattle is highly biocompatible and combines both cancer imaging and tumor treatment capabilities ( chemotherapy and photothermal therapy in near infrared range ) .",
    "all these advantages in matching and even outperforming the state - of - the - art nanotechnology - based medical agents are achieved thanks to just auqds , whereas a contribution of gnps is very small .",
    "specifically , the photothermal therapy using the quantum rattles is provided through excitation of auqds by an infrared laser , then the auqds emit infrared fluorescence and enough heat to kill cancerous cells . in these quantum rattles ,",
    "the gnps are likely just processing waste . meanwhile ,",
    "as their sizes ( 7.3  nm ) happen to fall close to the `` favourable '' range of @xmath300  nm , the presence of gnps in quantum rattles under discussion could be used for additional targeted heating of the latter by rf irradiation .",
    "another recent work by @xcite outlines the use of gold nanorods ( of 10 nm diameter / 41 nm length ) connected to nanodiamonds , whereby the gold part serves to hyperthermia , by near - infrared laser heating , and the nitrogen - vacancy centers in diamond serve for temperature sensing . here",
    "again , the use of nanoparticles of 5  7 nm size in place of nanorods would hopefully help to extend this technique over rf - induced hyperthermia .",
    "last but not least , the rf heating of gnps may be of interest for developers of therapeutic strategies targeting to inhibit amyloidogenic process in the alzheimer s disease .",
    "@xcite suggested to use in this context the gnps of @xmath310  nm size heated by the microwave 14  ghz radiation .",
    "chances are that using the gnps of `` optimal '' sizes would be useful for these tasks , too .",
    "we suggest a physical model of the size effect in heat generation in gnps , which also accounts for a reduction of heat generation as the gnps get aggregated . in this model ,",
    "the lavms ( dominating in the distribution of vibrational density of states ) play an important role ",
    "an apparently novel element in the related theory framework . according to our model",
    ", the heating of gnps is thought to consist of two consecutive processes : first , the fermi electron absorbs simultaneously the rf photon and the lavm available in the gnp ; hereafter the excited electron is relaxed , exciting a lavm with the energy higher than that of the previously absorbed lavm .",
    "the model predicts that the gnps to be effectively heated should possess diameters of @xmath311  nm , i.e. , very close to the experimentally inspected @xmath312  nm . the absorption band is expected to be very wide ( @xmath306  mhz",
    " 3  ghz ) .",
    "this allows the use of frequencies typical for the `` conventional '' rf hyperthermia ( without conducting nanoparticles ) .",
    "the energy release in the gnps can be optimized by tuning the rf frequency , searching a compromise between the hr energy transfer efficiency and a penetration depth of the rf radiation into the biological tissue .",
    "the gnps containing ta or fe impurity atoms are expected to be more effective heaters compared to nanoparticles of pure gold , due to enhanced electron density of states at the fermi level .",
    "gold nanoparticles with rare - earth impurity atoms are also brought into consideration as promising for the rf hyperthermia with conducting nanoparticles .",
    "the significance of the present study follows from the fact that the cancer specialists seeking approval for human clinical trials on the basis of their experimental results remain thus far in the dark in what regards the physical mechanism behind the observed trends .",
    "the authors sincerely thank drs .",
    "curley , muoz and gong for their kind permissions to use the figures from their works .",
    "we also would like to thank drs .",
    "muoz and kresch for useful discussions of their measurements of the phonon dos in gold .",
    "@xcite adopted the one - electron approximation to electrons in small metallic particles , whereupon d.y .",
    "@xcite predicted and j.  @xcite experimentally demonstrated the existence of the bulklike core region in them .",
    "this justifies considering the gnp as a crystalline one and permits to specify a relationship between the level spacing of electrons and number of atoms in gnp , using formulas for the free electron gas .",
    "a gnp of cuboid shape and consisting of @xmath21 atoms contains ( one `` free '' electron per atom of gold ) @xmath21 electrons filling the energy levels up to the fermi energy @xmath19 .",
    "the free - electron edos is ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath313 where @xmath314 is a number of states within the energy interval @xmath315 , @xmath75 is the cuboid s edge and @xmath316 the planck constant .",
    "then the total number of electrons is @xmath317 in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ eq : a1 ] ) , the spacing @xmath119 between the fermi level and nearest energy level above it equals @xmath318 , where @xmath319 , hence @xmath320 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a2 ] ) and ( [ eq : a3 ] ) , the kubo s formula is deduced : @xmath321",
    "assuming that the lavms propagate with ( longitudinal ) sound velocity @xmath123 along the circular contour at depth @xmath122 under the surface of spherical particle of diameter @xmath5 , the phonon energy quantum is @xmath322 $ ] .",
    "however , insofar as phonons are absorbed /created in the process of the electron excitations / relaxations , the phonon energies can only change in blocks , commensurable with the electron states quantization , i.e. , respecting the energy conservation condition of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mel ] ) , @xmath323 . only certain combinations ( @xmath141 )",

    "we note that the apparently `` competitive '' values of @xmath5 by their closeness to the reference values , namely , @xmath327  nm and 10.44  nm , can only be selected with much higher values of @xmath56 and , consequently , may only intervene with much sparser distribution , and hence much smaller impact , or their allowed vibration modes . for @xmath324",
