    "based on the scaling theory , it is expected that non - interacting electrons are localized for any weak disorder in two dimensions in zero magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this theoretical result was questioned when transport experiments in 2d silicon metal - oxide - semiconductor field - effect transistors ( mosfet s ) showed a metallic phase with @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the resistivity , at higher density of carriers than the critical density of carriers , @xmath3 and an insulating phase with @xmath4 at lower density of carriers , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "further experiments supported the observation of a mit in 2d systems @xcite .",
    "the interplay of disorder and electron - electron interaction can have an important effect in 2d systems .",
    "the recent experiments have shown that electron - electron interactions can lead to a possible metallic phase in the 2d electron gas .",
    "motivated by these experiments , we investigate the 2d disordered hubbard model at half - filling @xcite . in previous work , a possible metallic phase at @xmath6 with extended wave functions , sandwiched between a mott insulator for low disorder and a localized insulator for large disorder , is found . in the metallic phase ,",
    "the spectral gap is zero but antiferromagnetism is found to persist .",
    "the existence of a metallic phase is confirmed by the finite size scaling behavior of the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) . at intermediate disorder , the ipr for @xmath7 extrapolates to a finite value as @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the system is a localized .",
    "however , for the interacting system , @xmath9 , the ipr as a function of @xmath10 extrapolates to zero in the thermodynamic limit , implying a diverging localization length would occur in a metallic phase . the fact that the non - interacting system with the same disorder realization had a finite localization length indicates that interactions clearly played an important role in delocalizing the wave functions or at least in making them much more extended than the wave functions in the absence of interaction .",
    "the study of the hubbard model has been stimulated after the discovery of cuprate superconductors , such as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the doping concentration and @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the concentration of electrons @xcite .",
    "a systematic phase diagram of the copper oxide materials is shown in fig .  [",

    ", @xmath17 shows a dome shaped dependence on x. this doping not only gives superconductivity but also introduces disorder .",
    "a realistic modeling will therefore need to consider both effects of electron correlation and disorder .",
    "our focus is to understand the competition between random disorder and electron - electron interaction on the mott phase with long - range af order in 2d . in order to characterize the phases ,",
    "we calculate the temperature and frequency dependent conductivity and spin susceptibility .",
    "the calculation are done for the two - dimensional disordered hubbard model on lattices of size up to @xmath18 at @xmath6 and as function of temperature and disorder using a numerical hartree - fock self - consistent method .",
    "our results are reported at half filling for interaction strength , @xmath9 .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : dis_model ] , we give the model and the hartree - fock method . in section [ sec : dis_method ] , the self - consistent numerical method is presented . in section",
    "[ sec : dis_result ] , we give our results of the conductivity and spin susceptibility .",
    "this is followed by a concluding discussion and an outline of possible future research .",
    "we consider the disordered strongly correlated electron system described by the 2d one - band hubbard model with site disorder : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the near - neighbor hopping amplitude , @xmath21 is the on - site repulsion between electrons , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) is the creation ( destruction ) operator for an electron with spin @xmath24 on site @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the number operator at site @xmath25 , and @xmath27 is the chemical potential .",
    "@xmath28 is local disorder potential at site @xmath25 and is chosen from a uniform distribution , @xmath29 $ ] , where @xmath30 is the measure of the strength of disorder .",
    "the hubbard model with @xmath31 describes the essential physics of the copper oxide , @xmath32 , perovskites upon doping . at half filling , @xmath33 , with no disorder , the system at @xmath6 has long - range antiferromagnetic ( af ) order and is a mott - type insulator .",
    "the mean - field approximation is applied for the electron - electron interaction with the following prescription : @xmath34 then the effective hamiltonian , ignoring constant terms , @xmath35 , becomes @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 . in our calculation , we assume @xmath41 and @xmath42 are real so @xmath43 .",
    "we therefore have 3n variational parameters , @xmath44 for both spin species and @xmath45 at the @xmath46 site that must be determined self - consistently .",
    "explicitly , the effective hamiltonian for @xmath46 lattice sites in the bases , @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 with periodic boundary conditions is : @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "the inhomogeneous hartree - fock approximation for the disordered hubbard model generates a matrix with local densities , @xmath44 , and local magnetic fields , @xmath45 , which are variational parameters and must be solved self - consistently for each @xmath27 @xcite . for half filling , @xmath52 with no disorder but in the presence of disorder , @xmath27 is adjusted to satisfy the half filling condition .",
    "the initial input parameters for @xmath44 and @xmath45 are determined as follows : for low disorder we start the self - consistent procedure with an af initial condition for @xmath44 . on the other hand , for high disorder",
    "a paramagnetic state is used for the stating configuration . for both cases ,",
    "@xmath45 are chosen from an af initial condition from @xmath53 or @xmath54 . the initial condition for @xmath45 should not affect the results .",
    "the broyden method is used for achieving self - consistency efficiently @xcite .",
    "input and output fields are compared after each iteration and if the difference of the fields at all sites is less than @xmath55 , the self - consistentcy loop is exited . using these final self - consistent fields , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and eigenvalues , physical quantities of interest such as conductivity",
    "are calculated .",
    "we also test that the self - consistent values of the parameters are not dependent on the initial starting conditions for the parameters .",
    "our main effort in this part of the thesis is to calculate the frequency and temperature dependent conductivity and spin susceptibility , which are experimentally measurable and provide further characterization of these phases .",
    "summary of results are the following . in region 2 ,",
    "the conductivity near @xmath56 is most enhanced and shows the drude like behavior and the peak frequency , where the conductivity has the maximum value , is lowest .",
    "the drude model can explain non - monotonic behavior of the dc conductivity as a function of @xmath57 .",
    "the result of ac conductivity shows non - fermi liquid type behavior in region 2 .",
    "the sum rule is justified except for high @xmath57 at low disorder .",
    "the temperature dependent behavior of spin susceptibility , @xmath58 , shows the nature of moments . at high @xmath57 ,",
    "the moments are free as indicated by their curie behavior ; at low @xmath57 , @xmath58 is strongly suppressed because electrons get paired by forming singlet on low disorder and by on - site pairing on high disorder sites .",
    "the real part of frequency dependent conductivity , @xmath59 , is related to the imaginary part of the current - current correlation function @xcite , @xmath60=\\frac{\\mathrm{im}\\lambda(\\omega)}{\\omega},\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the fourier transform of @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the paramagnetic current density operator .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] shows @xmath59 for various disorder strengths and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] shows the gap of the conductivity as a function of disorder and the value of @xmath64 where the conductivity has a peak as a function of disorder .     the frequency dependence of the conductivity , @xmath59 , for @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the system size is @xmath67 , @xmath9 , and the data is averaged over @xmath68 disorder realizations .",
    "the low frequency region of @xmath69 for @xmath70 is obtained by a third order polynomial fit of the current - current correlation function , @xmath71 .",
    "for @xmath72 there is clearly a finite mott gap at the low frequency .",
    "thus , @xmath59 is suppressed at low frequency and there is a peak in the frequency when @xmath64 is around the mott gap . with increasing disorder the spectral weight above the mott gap",
    "is transfered to lower spectral region and the peak of @xmath59 moves to the low frequency . at @xmath73 ,",
    "the gap in the conductivity closes because energy scale of disorder is comparable with the gap . near @xmath70 ,",
    "the conductivity near @xmath56 is most enhanced and the frequency where the conductivity has the maximum value is lowest . for @xmath74 and @xmath75 ,",
    "the dc conductivity , @xmath76 , is zero due to the anderson insulating regime . in region 2 , the peak location of @xmath59 moves to the low frequency as the mott gap closes but with increasing disorder the peak location again moves to the high frequency in region 3,width=377,height=302 ]    [ cols= \" > , < \" , ]     at low temperature , for low disorder , @xmath77 vanishes indicating a spin gap .",
    "@xmath78 is finite due to long - range af order in the system .",
    "as @xmath57 increases @xmath77 and @xmath78 increase , reach a maximum at a characteristic temperature and decrease at higher temperatures .",
    "the spin susceptibilities are most enhanced at intermediate disorder , ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "also , the fitted parameters , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is used for the fitting the tail of @xmath77 , are considered to see local moments and the strength of paramagnetism . on the other hand ,",
    "the curie susceptibility of the spin at @xmath82 for localized electrons is @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the density , @xmath85 is 2 , and @xmath86 is a local moment .",
    "at high @xmath57 increasing disorder , the number of on - site coupling of up and down spin electrons increases because electrons can occupy the low disordered sites and not occupy the strongly disordered sites .",
    "these coupled sites and unoccupied sites have no contribution on local moments , so @xmath58 is more suppressed with increasing disorder at high @xmath57 .",
    "the plot of @xmath79 justify this description .",
    "these are increased with increasing disorder as expected . on the other hand , at low @xmath57 , we consider the pauli paramagnetic susceptibility for free electrons : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the bohr magneton and @xmath89 is the dos at the fermi level . for low disorder , there is a spin gap because dos@xmath90 .",
    "increasing disorder , @xmath58 is enhanced due to the increase of available states .",
    "increasing disorder further ( e.g. @xmath91 or @xmath92 ) , this enhancement disappears because of the suppressed local moments at strong disordered sites .",
    "in summary , we have calculated @xmath93 $ ] , the frequency and temperature dependence of conductivity , for the two - dimensional hubbard model with disorder at half filling using an inhomogeneous self - consistent hartree - fock numerical method .",
    "there is a gap in @xmath94 $ ] at low disorder .",
    "the characteristic temperature dependence of the conductivity in the mott insulator shows @xmath95 for low @xmath57 and @xmath96 at high @xmath57 arising primarily from a carrier dominated regime at low @xmath57 to a scattering dominated regime at high @xmath57 . upon increasing disorder ,",
    "the spectral weight around the mott gap is shifted to low frequencies and @xmath97 grows with disorder .",
    "@xmath97 is enhanced at intermediate disorder with @xmath98 for low temperature .",
    "however , @xmath97 is zero in the mott insulator and in the strongly localized regime .",
    "moreover , we have calculated @xmath99 , uniform spin susceptibility , and @xmath100 , staggered spin susceptibility . from the results of uniform static spin susceptibility , we considered the spin formation in each region .",
    "we have investigated the effect of an inhomogeneous magnetic field , @xmath101 considering the case with @xmath102 at all sites .",
    "we could have not seen any significant difference between two cases , @xmath102 for all sites and @xmath103 .",
    "thus , the inhomogeneous field can only select the z direction on the 2d system and physical quantities that do not depend on z direction are not depending on @xmath45 .",
