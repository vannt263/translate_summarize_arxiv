    "water maser emission ( @xmath9  cm in the rest frame ) is known to trace warm , dense gas at radii of 0.1 to 1 pc in the accretion disks surrounding supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it can also trace material heated by jet activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and wide - angle nuclear winds @xcite .",
    "emission from disks is visible when they are viewed close to edge - on and amplification paths are longest . several have been mapped with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) : ngc4258 @xcite , ngc1068 @xcite , and the circinus galaxy @xcite .",
    "`` maser disks '' may also exist in ic2560 @xcite , ngc5793 @xcite , and mrk1419 @xcite , though confirmation awaits further study .    triply peaked spectra characterize emission from accretion disks that are well populated by masers .",
    "emission close to the systemic velocity of the host galaxies ( i.e. , low - velocity emission ) occurs where orbital motion is transverse to the line of sight .",
    "high - velocity emission is symmetrically offset by the disk orbital velocities and arises in regions where the disk motion is parallel to the line of sight .",
    "velocities as high as @xmath10  have been observed ( i.e. , in ngc4258 ) .",
    "water maser sources in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are important astrophysical tracers in part because vlbi can provide maps of resolved disk structure ( e.g. , warping ) and dynamics ( e.g. , rotation curves and proper motions ) , as in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , only @xmath11 h@xmath0o masers are known in agn , and few of these exhibit triply peaked spectra .",
    "the discovery of new masers is a priority and a challenge .",
    "first , the emission is typically weak , and surveys must invest substantial time observing each target with the largest available apertures ( e.g. , 1 hour with a 100 m diameter antenna ) .",
    "second , mean detection rates in surveys are typically @xmath12% for seyfert  ii galaxies closer than @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "third , because the orbital speeds of disks ( and concomitant velocity range of maser emission ) can not be known in advance , surveys must have instantaneous bandwidths of thousands of .",
    "sufficiently broadband observing systems have become available to the general community only recently .",
    "we report the detection of seven new masers obtained in a high sensitivity , broad bandwidth survey of 160 nearby agn ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the survey was unusual for two reasons .",
    "first , we used a 70-m antenna of the nasa deep space network ( dsn ) to achieve high sensitivity ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "second , we used a custom built , portable , 5350-wide spectrometer .",
    "the survey , which is ongoing at dsn facilities in the northern and southern hemispheres , and the hardware will be discussed in detail elsewhere .",
    "the 70-m dsn antenna located at tidbinbilla , near canberra , is equipped with a cooled 18 to 26  ghz hemt receiver .",
    "the left circular polarization channel is limited by a selectable 600  mhz bandpass filter and downconverted to a band centered at 321.4  mhz . a second downconversion and bandpass filter",
    "deliver a 400 mhz baseband ( @xmath15  at @xmath9  cm ) at the input of a 2-bit , four - level , 4096-lag digital autocorrelator .",
    "survey observations were conducted between 2002 may and september .",
    "the zenith system temperature was typically 40k under good winter observing conditions , and zenith opacities were typically @xmath16 .",
    "the temperature was calibrated with respect to an ambient load .",
    "the peak aperture efficiency was @xmath17 , and we determined its dependence on elevation through antenna temperature measurements of pks1830@xmath18211 ( @xmath19  jy ) and pks1921@xmath18293 ( @xmath20  jy ) .",
    "we calibrated these flux densities against 3c286 ( 2.6  jy at 21.8  ghz ) with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) on 2002 september 9 and 12 .",
    "we measured and corrected for pointing errors ( at the 70-m antenna ) , which were under most circumstances on the order of @xmath21 or 8% of the half - power beamwidth . as a result",
    ", we estimate the flux density calibration of spectra is uncertain by @xmath22 .    to construct total - power spectra for each agn , we nodded the antenna between signal and reference positions . switching times of 30 or 45 s were usually sufficient to produce flat baselines in the spectra .",
    "we removed residual fluctuations by subtracting a running mean computed over intervals of 256 channels ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "heliocentric velocities were computed from sky frequencies determined by the digital tuning of receiver elements , using the radio definition of doppler shift .",
    "this calibration should be accurate to better than 0.1 .",
    "we checked it by observing the h66@xmath24 radio recombination line in w33 , which has a known local standard of rest velocity of @xmath25  @xcite , and for which we measured a velocity of @xmath26 .",
    "we observed 160 agn with the tidbinbilla antenna and obtained typical noise levels of 10 to 20 mjy ( @xmath27 ) with 30 minutes of on - source integration .",
    "we discovered seven new h@xmath0o masers ( table1 , figure1 ) .",
    "each detection has been confirmed through observation on more than one day .",
    "we have also measured positions for six of the new masers with the very large array ( vla ) of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) or the atca .",
    "these observing tracks were also used to estimate continuum flux density levels from the underlying agn at about @xmath28  cm ( table1 ) . where we detected continuum emission , it was coincident with the maser emission , to within estimated uncertainties ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "six masers lie in seyfertii objects , and one lies in a nucleus whose classification is ambiguous ( ngc2824 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the masers in ngc5643 and ngc6300 lie in galaxies that had been targeted in previous searches .",
    "@xcite reported noise levels of 59 to 87  mjy for ngc5643 and 59  mjy for ngc6300 in @xmath29  wide channels , after hanning smoothing .",
    "@xcite report noise levels of 119 and 109 mjy for the two galaxies respectively , with 0.8  wide channels . at the strength we measured ( @xmath30  mjy in a 1.3  channel without hanning smoothing ) , the maser emission in ngc5643 would have been detected at the 3 to @xmath31 level by these earlier observations , from which we conclude the maser emission varies significantly with time .",
    "the emission in ngc6300 is sufficiently weak that it would not have been detected by the earlier observations .",
    "two of the new maser sources exhibit discrete line complexes above and below the systemic velocity , which probably correspond to the high - velocity emission that is a characteristic of maser action in the accretion disks of supermassive black holes .",
    "eso269-g012 displays red and blueshifted high - velocity emission , symmetrically offset by @xmath32  kms@xmath33 from a narrow line near the systemic velocity of the galaxy ( figure2 ) .",
    "the inferred orbital speed is exceeded only by that of ngc4258 among known maser hosts .",
    "the high - velocity line complexes extend over @xmath34 , which may be due to the radial distribution of emitting gas .",
    "if the rotation curve is `` keplerian '' ( @xmath35 ) , then the outer radius of the molecular material in the disk would be @xmath36 times the inner radius .",
    "ngc6926 exhibits high - velocity emission that is symmetrically offset by up to @xmath37  from the systemic velocity ( figure1 ) .",
    "because the blueshifted emission is relatively weak , we have used the vla to confirm it is real .",
    "if the masers in eso269-g012 and ngc6926 lie in disks at radii of 0.1  pc , which is the radius of the innermost masers in ngc4258 , then the enclosed mass is on the order of @xmath38 to @xmath39 m@xmath40 .",
    "the corresponding centripetal acceleration in the eso269-g012 disk ( @xmath41 ) , which would be manifested by a secular velocity drift in the low - velocity emission , is @xmath42yr@xmath33 , which is large enough to measure readily within one year .",
    "the maser in ngc2824 lies in an early - type galaxy and displays an anomalously broad line profile ( @xmath43  half power full width ) .",
    "broad lines are also seen toward other early - type galaxies that host maser sources ( e.g. , ngc1052 , mrk348 ) , where the emission is seen toward radio jets rather than accretion disks @xcite . however , any correspondence between hubble - type and maser characteristics is tentative .",
    "for example , the maser in irasf01063@xmath188034 is broad @xcite , but the galaxy is believed to be type sa ( though it is difficult to classify because it is edge - on ) . in ngc1386 and irasf22265@xmath181826 , the relative positions of the masers and jets therein are unknown because the jets are undetected at about @xmath4  cm @xcite . for ngc2824 , we have established a 1 mjy ( @xmath31 ) upper limit on continuum emission at @xmath44  cm ( table1 ) .",
    "previously reported h@xmath0o maser emission in the circinus galaxy comprises two broad complexes of lines that bracket the systemic velocity ( @xmath45 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with spectral features offset by as much as @xmath46   @xcite .",
    "vlbi images ( @xmath47  mjy @xmath27 noise ) resolve a warped accretion disk and show emission with somewhat larger @xmath48  doppler shifts @xcite .",
    "this is the maximum detected orbital speed , and it corresponds to a radius of @xmath49 pc .",
    "we have detected weak ( @xmath50 jy ) high - velocity emission that establishes a @xmath51 to @xmath52  range of emission ( i.e. , doppler shifts up to @xmath53 ) .",
    "the rotation curve of the circinus accretion disk is approximately keplerian @xcite .",
    "if the new emission arises in the accretion disk , then it lies at @xmath7 pc radius ( @xmath54 schwarzschild radii for a @xmath55 m@xmath40 black hole ) , and future vlbi studies will be able to map the rotation curve and warp of the accretion disk over an expanded range of radii .",
    "we have detected new h@xmath0o maser sources in seven agn , as well as new high - velocity emission components in the circinus galaxy .",
    "two of the new masers exhibit high - velocity emission , indicative of emission from accretion disks .",
    "it should be possible to map these two disks with vlbi , trace their rotation curves , and weigh the central engines that bind them .",
    "ultimately , it may be possible to measure geometric distances to the two host galaxies , which would be significant because both lie in the hubble flow .",
    "one of the new masers lies in an early - type galaxy , and we speculate that it might therefore be associated with an as yet undetected jet .",
    "we have also discovered new high - velocity water maser emission in the circinus galaxy , vlbi observation of which could greatly improve our understanding of its accretion disk .",
    "we thank c. timoc and spaceborne , inc . for designing and building the correlator , and for technical support in the field .",
    "we are grateful for the invaluable support and assistance given by the management , operations , and technical staff of the cdscc , and in particular thank j. lauf for his technical assistance with our program early on .",
    "we also acknowledge the contributions of c. garcia - miro ( inta ) , j. f. gmez , e. jimnez bailn , and i. de gregorio - monsalvo ( laeff / inta ) to testing of the spectrometer and observing software at the madrid dsn station prior to the observing season in australia . this work was supported in part by r&d funds of the smithsonian astrophysical observatory .",
