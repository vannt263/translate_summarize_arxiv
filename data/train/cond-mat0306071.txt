    "figure ( [ fig4 ] ) ) and gives credit to the stripe picture of superconductivity in this material .",
    "it is , however , hard to explain the difference between fe and ni substitution to the otherwise overdoped @xmath123 sample . according to the theory @xcite one expects in this material incomensurate stripes and thus no influence of impurities on both @xmath3 and @xmath0 .",
    "the difficulty arises from the fact that both impurities ( @xmath124 and @xmath125 ) do change the transition temperature but the isotope shift is nearly constant for @xmath124 substitution .",
    "one explanation is that concentration of carriers may change in the doping process .",
    "the divalent @xmath124 does not change the concentration and the position of the fermi level remains roughly constant while trivalent fe ions change it driving the system effectively into underdoped or optimally doped regime .",

    "these issues have been recently addressed @xcite .",
    "the xanes experiments revealed large oxygen isotope effect on the stripe formation temperature @xmath127 , as also on effective supercarrier mass .",
    "this shows that electron phonon interaction does play a role in a stripe model of superconductivity and validates the above analysis and conclusions .",
    "we have studied the effect of various impurities on the isotope coefficient @xmath0 . while the in - plane and out - of - plane impurities affect the superconducting transition temperature quite differently ( _ c.f . _",
    "1 ) , their influence on @xmath0 is universal for angle independent scattering relaxation rate and density of states function .",
    "experimental changes of @xmath6 with @xmath4 for a number of high temperature copper oxides can be well described solely by the effect of impurities on @xmath47-wave superconductors .",
    "the angle dependence of relaxation rate and @xmath59 or the simultaneous presence of anisotropic scatterers of magnetic and non - magnetic nature adds new degrees of freedom which can be used to quantitatively describe the data .",

    "<S> the influence of various kinds of impurities on the isotope shift exponent @xmath0 of high temperature superconductors has been studied . in these materials </S>",
    "<S> the dopant impurities , like @xmath1 in @xmath2 , play different role and usually occupy different sites than impurities like zn , fe , ni _ etc _ intentionally introduced into the system to study its superconducting properties . in the paper </S>",
    "<S> the in - plane and out - of - plane impurities present in layered superconductors have been considered . </S>",
    "<S> they differently affect the superconducting transition temperature @xmath3 . the relative change of isotope shift coefficient , however , is an universal function of @xmath4 ( @xmath5 reffers to impurity free system ) _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ for angle independent scattering rate and density of states function it does not depend whether the change of @xmath3 is due to in- or out - of - plane impurities . </S>",
    "<S> the role of the anisotropic impurity scattering in changing oxygen isotope coefficient of superconductors with various symmetries of the order parameter is elucidated . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of the calculated and experimental dependence of @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the clean system isotope shift coefficient , on @xmath4 is presented for a number of cases studied . </S>",
    "<S> the changes of @xmath0 calculated within stripe model of superconductivity in copper oxides resonably well describe the data on @xmath8 , without any fitting parameters . </S>"
