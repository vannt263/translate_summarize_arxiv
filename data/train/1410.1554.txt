    "the birth of the topological insulators ( ti ) in recent years has been one of the most exciting events in condensed matter and material science fields due to their novelty and potential technological applications@xcite . shortly after the theoretical prediction@xcite",
    ", the first experimental realization of a time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) protected ti was reported in hgte/(hg , cd)te quantum wells@xcite .",
    "though in all the accepted experimental examples of ti to date , the presence of the topological state and most of its properties can be well understood within a noninteracting model , it is , however , generally believed that interactions can lead to qualitatively new topological phenomena in both two@xcite and three dimensions@xcite . in two - dimensions , the kane - mele ( km )",
    "model@xcite has played an especially important role in the study of @xmath0 ti [ also known as quantum spin hall insulators ( qsh ) ] .",
    "the km model consists of two time - reversed copies of the haldane model@xcite on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) honeycomb lattice , with real first - neighbor hopping and imaginary second - neighbor hopping arising from spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) . to study interaction effects ,",
    "the km model has been supplemented with an onsite hubbard @xmath1-term @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number of electrons on site @xmath4 with spin @xmath5 .",
    "the so called kane - mele - hubbard ( kmh ) model is investigated extensively@xcite , particularly with quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) which is free of the fermion sign problem@xcite .",
    "its phase diagram is now well understood . beyond the critical value of interaction strength @xmath6 ,",
    "there exists a magnetic phase transition which turns a topological state to an easy - plane antiferromagnetic order state .",
    "recently , several fermion sign - free extensions of the kmh model have been proposed and studied with qmc@xcite with the goal of understanding short - ranged interaction effects on the hopping - parameter - driven @xmath0 topological phase transitions at half - filling and at intermediate interaction , i.e. @xmath7 . the numerical results concluded that the onsite hubbard interaction leads either to stabilize the qsh against the parameter that drives the @xmath0 topological phase transition from a topological insulating phase to a trivial insulating phase or to destabilize it by making it more fragile to the parameter .",
    "though the @xmath0 topological phase transitions have been examined using qmc , there has been no proposal of an  analytically  physical picture that captures the numerical results .",
    "most important of all , without symmetry breaking , the conventional mean - field approximation in some cases does not provide any correction to realize the topological boundary shifts observed in qmc . in this brief review article",
    ", we propose an analytical method , dubbed perturbative mean - field ( pmf ) method , which combines the perturbative treatment and the mean - field treatment . for pedagogy and illustrating the power of the general analytical framework we introduce , we study three variants of kmh  generalized kane - mele model ( gkm ) , dimerized kane - mele model ( dkm ) , and stagger - potential kane - mele model ( skm ) described by eq .  , eq .   and eq .  , supplemented by a hubbard-@xmath1 term eq .",

    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 are the order parameters to describe the charge - density - wave and spin - density wave orders , where we have explicitly neglected the constant @xmath13 appearing in the mean - field hamiltonian since it only shifts the total energy .",
    "it is clear that the mean - field decoupled hamiltonian only gives an overall density correction which renormalizes the chemical potential without renormalizing the bare hopping amplitudes . for the skm described by eq .",
    ", we will see that the usual conventional mean - field treatment is enough to predict the shift of the critical value of the relevant parameter .",
    "however , for gkm and dkm described by eq .",
    "and eq .  , the relevant parameters that drive the topological transitions are the hopping amplitudes and the qmc explicitly sees that the critical values of the relevant hopping amplitudes shift in the presence of a  local  interaction , which can not be captured within the conventional mean - field picture . hence , an analytical method that is beyond the conventional mean - field treatment is needed .    in order to develop an analytical method which can generate terms that renormalize the hopping amplitudes from a ",
    "interaction @xmath1 , and , somehow , reproduce the results of the conventional mean - field treatment , we consider to expand the interacting term in series of @xmath14 for the partition function of the full interacting hamiltonian , @xmath15 , which mimics the way of doing perturbative analysis .",
    "the expansion to first order , @xmath16 , gives the term of the local interaction and under mean - field decoupling we can regain the results of the conventional mean - field treatment after re - exponentiating the term to be combined with the noninteracting hamiltonian @xmath17 .",
    "the expansion to second order of @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath19 , gives eight - fermion terms consisting of fermions at two different sublattices @xmath20 and @xmath21 of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the mean - field decoupling of the second - order terms give bilinear terms consisting of the total density at site @xmath22 @xmath23 and two - point correlation functions between sites @xmath4 and @xmath22 , @xmath24 .",
    "again we can re - exponentiate the terms to be combined with the original noninteracting hamiltonian @xmath17 and examine how the bare hamiltonian gets renormalized . during the mean - field decouplings of the first - order and second - order terms",

    "<S> time - reversal symmetric topological insulator is a novel state of matter that a bulk - insulating state carries dissipationless spin transport along the surfaces , embedded by the @xmath0 topological invariant . in the noninteracting limit , this exotic state has been intensively studied and explored with realistic systems , such as hgte/(hg , cd)te quantum wells . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> electronic correlation plays a significant role in many solid - state systems , which further influences topological properties and triggers topological phase transitions . yet </S>",
    "<S> an interacting topological insulator is still an elusive subject , and most related analyses rely on the mean - field approximation and numerical simulations . among the approaches , </S>",
    "<S> the mean - field approximation fails to predict the topological phase transition , in particular at intermediate interaction strength without spontaneously breaking symmetry . in this review </S>",
    "<S> , we develop an analytical approach based on a combined perturbative and self - consistent mean - field treatment of interactions that is capable of capturing topological phase transitions beyond either method when used independently . as an illustration of the method , we study the effects of short - ranged interactions on the @xmath0 topological insulator phase , also known as the quantum spin hall phase , in three generalized versions of the kane - mele model at half - filling on the honeycomb lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the results are in excellent agreement with quantum monte carlo calculations on the same model , and can not be reproduced by either a perturbative treatment or a self - consistent mean - field treatment of the interactions . </S>",
    "<S> our analytical approach helps to clarify how the symmetries of the one - body terms of the hamiltonian determine whether interactions tend to stabilize or destabilize a topological phase . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our method should be applicable to a wide class of models where topological transitions due to interactions are in principle possible , but are not correctly predicted by either perturbative or self - consistent treatments . </S>"
