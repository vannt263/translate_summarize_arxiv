    "proton acceleration from laser - plasma interaction has been of great interest to researchers over the past few decades @xcite because of its importance for a low - cost tabletop accelerators @xcite , fast ignition in inertial confinement fusion @xcite , high resolution radiographing @xcite , cancer radiation therapy @xcite and laboratory astrophysics @xcite .",
    "radiation pressure dominated acceleration ( rpda ) @xcite has been proposed as an effective mechanism to obtain hundreds of mev of monoenergetic and collimated proton beams .",
    "unfortunately , rpda suffers from multi - dimensional effects , such as the target deformation and the transverse `` rayleigh - taylor - like '' instability",
    ". the acceleration process can not be as stable as predicted by theory or 1d pic simulations , which results in a shortening of the acceleration length , a reduction of maximum energy and a broadening of the energy spectrum of the proton beam .    as a result",
    ", a lot of attempts have been made to suppress those multi - dimensional effects , among which are , the laser mode scheme @xcite , shaped target scheme @xcite and target composition scheme @xcite , etc . specifically speaking , with the optimized laser pulse ( like the transverse super - gaussian pulse or the laguerre - gaussian pulse ) and the corresponding shaped target structure , the target deformation problem can be prevented , effectively . despite all these efforts mentioned above , it is still difficult to obtain ultra - energetic protons , for instance , of the order of tens of gev or even higher .",
    "so , it is necessary to look for an alternative long - distance and stable proton acceleration mechanism .",
    "it is known that electrons can be accelerated stably over a very long distance in a plasma wakefield @xcite .",
    "this laser wakefield acceleration ( lwfa ) regime was proved to be theoretically capable to accelerate protons as long as they can get trapped by the fast - moving wakefield @xcite .",
    "further , a more specific theory about the trapping condition of protons was established by shen and his group @xcite . generally speaking , a proton pre - acceleration stage , which is used to increase the proton velocity , and a high plasma gas density , which is used to decrease the wakefield velocity ,",
    "are needed to satisfy that trapping condition . above theory has been verified by 2d pic simulations and optimized by adding a mass - limited target in the plasma gas region to improve the monochromaticity of the ultra - energetic proton beams , by combining lwfa with rpda .",
    "the combined acceleration regime has been further developed in many studies by using optimized laser modes @xcite and modulated underdense plasma gas @xcite , in order to get ultra - energetic and collimated proton beams .",
    "most recently , to further improve the energy spectrum of the proton beams , the target composition scheme has also been proposed and verified by 1d pic simulations @xcite . with the use of a multi - component target , on one hand",
    ", the heavy ions can supply excess co - moving electrons for protons , provide them with a negative - gradient `` bunching '' electrostatic field and preserve their stable acceleration . on the other hand",
    ", the heavy ion layer will be separated from the lighter proton layer , because of its smaller charge - to - mass ratio , and will expand in space .",
    "the expansion of the heavy ion layer behind the proton layer will protect it from the `` rayleigh - taylor - like '' instability . in such target composition scheme ,",
    "the pure h target is replaced by a ch target to ensure that a more stable rpda stage can be realized . with a more stable first stage",
    ", the protons in the ch target can be more efficiently injected into the wakefield than in the pure h target case .",
    "thus , improvement of the monochromaticity of the proton beams can be achieved after the second lwfa stage .    in this paper ,",
    "multi - dimensional effects in above target composition scheme in combined proton acceleration regime are investigated and verified by 2d pic simulations .",
    "it is found , in 2d cases , that using a ch target can not only lower the energy spread of the proton beam , but can also increase the maximum proton energy , as compared to the use of a pure h target .",
    "additionally , it is worth mentioning that the combined regime using h target requires an ultra - high laser intensity to get protons pre - accelerated strong enough by rpda in the first stage , so that they can get trapped by the fast - moving wakefield in the second stage and be further accelerated to ultra - high energy . by replacing the pure h target with a ch one , this high requirement for the laser intensity",
    "can be eased down . moreover ,",
    "the proton energy can be further increased by employing a longitudinally negative gradient of the background plasma density .",
    "a two - dimensional spatial and three - velocity fully relativistic electromagnetic particle - in - cell ( 2d3v pic ) code klap @xcite is used to verify this optimized combined proton acceleration regime .",
    "the total simulation box is @xmath6 with @xmath7 @xmath8 , which is the wavelength of the laser pulse , corresponding to a @xmath9 cells moving window .    , the thickness is @xmath10 and the transverse size is @xmath11 .",
    "the density of the background plasma is @xmath12 , the length is @xmath13 and the transverse size is @xmath14 .",
    "the tritium background plasma has an effective z / a ratio of the order of 1/3 . a circular polarized ( cp ) laser pulse with a transverse super - gaussian ( sg ) profile enters the simulation box from the left boundary.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the model is shown in fig.[fig.1 ] .",
    "a laser pulse is injected initially and propagates along z - axis from the left of the simulation box .",
    "the normalized amplitude of the circularly polarized ( cp ) laser amplitude is @xmath15 , with @xmath16 ( super - gaussian , transversely ) @xcite and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the vector potential , @xmath19 is the vacuum light speed , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the charge and mass of electrons , and @xmath22 is the laser period , respectively .",

    ". different ratio of @xmath32 to @xmath31 will be examined . for an underdense plasma gas ,",
    "the density is @xmath35 ( corresponding to @xmath36 @xmath29 ) .",
    "the density of this plasma gas is higher than in previous works @xcite , in order to ensure a formation of a slower and more stable wakefield , so that protons can be injected into the wakefield more efficiently .",
    "the tritium plasma gas with an effective z / a ratio of the order of 1/3 is chosen for the same reason .",
    "and @xmath37 in the moving window are calculated for the average energy . different density ratios of carbon to proton are shown in different color lines .",
    "the blue line ( @xmath38 ) means the pure h target , while the black , red , green , cyan and magenta lines are for ch targets with different carbon density ratios ; @xmath39 with all other parameters are given in the simulation model.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    fig.[fig.2 ] shows the average energy of the protons in @xmath40 and @xmath37 in the moving window , evolving with time from @xmath41 to @xmath42 in the lwfa stage .",
    "it is clear that using ch targets can improve the average energy of the protons , effectively .",
    "specifically , for the pure h case , proton energy gets saturated after @xmath43 , with about @xmath44 gev maximum energy . however , for ch cases , the proton energies get saturated earlier than in the h case , at @xmath45 with about @xmath0 gev maximum energy , thus increasing the proton average energy by about @xmath46 .",
    "this also indicates that the acceleration efficiency of ch targets is higher than that of h target .",
    "additionally , by increasing the percentage of the carbon ions density , the averaged energy and the effectiveness will increase , as well .",

    "not only are the proton maximum energies increased , but also their energy spreads are decreased .",
    "the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of pure h case is about @xmath2 , while that of the ch cases is about @xmath47 for @xmath48 case , @xmath49 for @xmath50 case and @xmath3 for @xmath51 case , respectively .",
    "all of above are smaller than that for pure h case . in fig.[fig.3 ] ( b ) , the phase space of the ultra - energetic protons shows the similar results as that in fig.[fig.3 ] ( a ) . despite a larger number of protons in pure h target ,",
    "the beam structure is quite spread in space and the maximum energy is only about @xmath0 gev . on the contrary ,",
    "the beam structures from the ch targets are very compact and almost all of the maximum energies are larger than @xmath52 gev .",

    "[ fig.4 ] can explain why the use of ch targets can accelerate protons to a higher energy in the lwfa stage . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] ( a ) , for the pure h case at @xmath45 , protons with the highest energy have been accelerated out of the wakefield region .",
    "in contrast , for the ch target , most protons are still located at the front of the wakefield , where @xmath54 is the largest , in fig.[fig.4 ] ( b ) .",
    "additionally , it is clearly seen that protons in h target are distributed sparsely in space , resulting in a tail structure with a lower energy behind the most energetic part . while the distribution of the ch protons is very compact with the equal high energy .",
    "when averaging around the region @xmath40 and @xmath55 at @xmath45 , there is no doubt that ch protons will get a higher energy , as compared to the pure h target protons .",
    "the longitudinal electrostatic field is also improved in ch target , as compared to the h case . as can be seen from fig.[fig.4 ] ( a )",
    ", @xmath54 is smaller in size and weaker in strength , as compared to that in fig.[fig.4 ] ( b ) . in the pure h target , because much of the laser energy is transferred to the relatively low - energy protons , which are distributed in the tail structure of the proton beam , the size and strength of the wakefield are decreased , as compared to those in ch case .",
    "moreover , when using a ch target , an optimized beam injection effect is realized .",
    "the proton beam has a compact structure , without the tail and such relatively low - energy protons in it . as a result",
    ", the laser energy can be transferred to the trapped protons more effectively .",
    "similarly , fig.[fig.4 ] can also explain why the use of ch target can optimize the proton energy spectrum . in the positive gradient `` debunching '' wakefield",
    ", protons at the front of the beam will experience a larger longitudinal electrostatic field and will be accelerated to a higher velocity , while those at the back of the beam will experience a smaller longitudinal electrostatic field and a lower speed .",
    "thus , the energy spread of the tail - structured proton beam of h target becomes broader than that of the compact - structured proton beam of ch target .",

    "furthermore , ( a ) and ( d ) are the result at @xmath56 , ( b ) and ( e ) are at @xmath57 , and ( c ) and ( f ) are at @xmath58 .",
    "all parameters are the same as for fig.[fig.2 ] . ]    by comparing the evolution of the electrostatic field in rpda stage , we can gain further understanding of the physical mechanisms leading to a proton beam quality improvement , when using a ch target instead of a h one .",
    "fig.[fig.5 ] shows the snapshots of @xmath54 and @xmath31 at @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "although the value of the @xmath54 for both targets is almost the same at the same time , there is a distinctive difference in the location of the proton beams . for ch target ,",
    "the protons are always located at the negative - gradient part , or the `` bunching '' part of @xmath54 , leading to the compact proton beam structure in fig.[fig.4 ] ( b ) , and resulting in a narrower energy spectrum .",
    "it is because there are heavy carbon ions behind protons , pushing them with coulomb repulsion effects .",
    "this will also lead to a larger @xmath54 , as can be seen in fig.[fig.5 ] ( e ) , as compared to that in fig.[fig.5 ] ( b ) at @xmath57 .",
    "however , for the pure h target , the protons are located at the `` bunching '' part of @xmath54 at @xmath56 , then at the peak part at @xmath57 and finally at the `` debunching '' part . from then on , the stability of rpda stage for pure h target becomes lower than that for the ch target .    in short ,",
    "our 2d pic simulation results agree with our former 1d analysis @xcite very well , indicating that the target composition scheme has an optimization effect on the combined proton acceleration regime .",
    "moreover , when considering multi - dimensional effects ( 2d pic ) , the optimization scheme performs even better , as compared to 1d scenario .",
    "not only are the monochromaticity of the energetic proton beams optimized , but also their maximum energies are improved .",
    "aiming at discovering the best set of laser and target parameters , which could improve the maximum energy and monochromaticity of the proton beam , parameter studies by varing the ch ratio , the laser intensity and the underdense plasma gas density profile have been done .",
    "fig.[fig.6 ] shows the influence of a number density ratio of carbon - to - hydrogen on the quality of the proton beam in the combined proton acceleration regime . by a series of 2d pic simulations with different density ratio of carbon - to - hydrogen",
    ", we found that , as the percentage of number density of @xmath59 increases , the maximum energy of the protons is decreasing , while the energy spread of the proton beam is increasing .",
    "for @xmath60 case , i.e. , when the percentage of @xmath59 gets @xmath61 , the maximum energy is only about @xmath62 gev and the energy spread is about @xmath2 .",
    "however , for @xmath51 case , or the percentage of @xmath59 is only @xmath47 , the maximum energy is almost @xmath1 gev and the energy spread is limited to only @xmath3 .",
    "the result clearly indicates that using a hydrocarbon target in the combined proton acceleration regime can largely improve the acceleration quality .    .",
    "all other parameters are the same as for fig.[fig.2 ] .",
    ", scaledwidth=70.0% ]      in addition to the ch ratio , here we also investigated the influence of laser intensity on the quality of the proton beam in the combined proton acceleration regime .",
    "as shown in fig.[fig.7 ] , by a series of 2d pic simulations within a given laser intensity range ( from @xmath63 to @xmath64 ) , the averaged proton energy is also increased , which is easy to understand .",
    "what interests us is that within above laser intensity range , the averaged proton energy of the ch target case is always larger than that of the h target case .",
    "the above results indicate that , if we want to accelerate the protons to a certain energy , we can use a lower laser intensity by replacing the h target with a ch one .",
    "on the other hand , at a fixed laser intensity , by using a ch target instead of a h one , we could get a higher proton energy .    .",
    "all other parameters are the same as for fig.[fig.2 ] .",
    ", scaledwidth=70.0% ]      at last , the influence of underdense plasma gas density profile on the proton beam quality is also investigated . in the electron lwfa regime",
    ", the dephasing length of the trapped electrons can be much longer by employing a positive density gradient@xcite .",
    "inspired by this improvement scheme , we can expect to improve the proton energy in the combined proton acceleration regime by using a negative gradient of the underdense background plasma ( bp ) gas .    .",
    "the green solid line is for the uniform bp case , while the black and red solid line are for the linearly and exponentially decreasing gradient bp case , respectively .",

    "[ fig.8 ] ( a ) shows the average proton beam energy for different underdense background plasma ( bp ) profiles .",
    "a linearly ( @xmath65 ) and an exponentially ( @xmath66}$ ] ) decreasing background plasma density are used to compare with the uniform case ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "as we expected , using a negative gradient of a background plasma can improve the average proton energy in the combined proton acceleration regime . and larger negative gradient results in a higher proton energy .",
    "from the energy spectrum of proton beams in fig .",
    "[ fig.8 ] ( b ) , the same result can be seen apparently .",
    "these results can be explained by analyzing the details of above acceleration carefully .",
    "for the uniform case , the trapped protons will catch up with the accelerating field at the laser front at about @xmath43 , and then these protons will stop acceleration and their energy will get saturated .",
    "however , for the negative gradient case , the phase velocity of the accelerating field becomes higher than before when it comes into the low density region .",
    "this theory has been well established in a number of former works @xcite and the velocity can be estimated as , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 . as the accelerating field moves faster , the trapped protons will stay in it for a longer time , and their energy will keep growing without getting saturated .    finally , it is worth mentioning that in the electron lwfa regime , as well as , in combined proton acceleration regime , the collimation quality is , as important as , the monochromaticity .",
    "however , the long acceleration distance in these regimes make it difficult to keep the energetic protons well collimated .",
    "moreover , laser - plasma instabilities and filamentation will also affect the transport of a laser pulse in the underdense background plasma . to improve the collimation quality , a lot of attempts",
    "have been made , including the famous plasma channeling scheme @xcite in the electron lwfa regime , and the transversely modulated background plasma density scheme @xcite , as well as , the lg laser pulse scheme @xcite in the combined proton acceleration regime .",
    "efforts of employing a channel - guided scheme in the combined proton acceleration regime have been made by our group and the result will be presented in future publications .",
    "in conclusion , a target composition scheme is proposed , based on 2d pic simulations , to optimize the maximum energy and energy spectrum of the combined proton acceleration regime ( rpda and lwfa ) . with the use of a ch target , instead of a h one , not only",
    "can the proton maximum energy be increased , but also the proton energy spread can be narrowed .",
    "for example , with the same laser intensity of @xmath69 @xmath5 and a tritium plasma gas density of @xmath36 @xmath29 , the use of @xmath70 ch target can improve the proton maximum energy by more than @xmath53 , from about @xmath0 gev to about @xmath52 gev .",
    "moreover , it can also optimize the energy spread by more than @xmath71 from about @xmath2 down to @xmath49 .",
    "explanations of the acceleration effectiveness and monochromaticity improvement have been made in both the rpda and lwfa stages . from the physical consideration",
    ", the carbon ion here plays a key role , leading to a more stable pre - acceleration of protons and then to a more compact beam structure in the lwfa stage . scaling studies of the ch ratio , laser intensity and background plasma density",
    "have been investigated in order to further limit the energy spread , to reduce the high requirement for the laser intensity and to increase the proton energy .",
