    "similarly , narrow quantum point contact constrictions allow experimentalists to control local scattering between counterpropagating integer @xcite or fractional edge channels @xcite .",
    "scanning gate microscopy ( sgm ) experiments on quantum point contacts in the integer quantum hall regime have complemented the conventional transport experiments by inducing a local potential perturbation in the electron gas near the quantum point contact with the scanning tip @xcite .",

    "an ac bias - voltage of @xmath12=20 @xmath13v was applied and the modulated source - drain current @xmath14 was measured simultaneously with standard lock - in techniques ( see fig .",

    "1b ) , not accounting for spin - splitting , four spin - degenerate even - integer edge channels will be present .",
    "once the tip approaches the qpc , the two depletion regions of the tip and the negatively biased gates are so close to each other that the innermost edge channels get reflected and the outer edge channels are still transmitted . consequently the detected qpc conductance @xmath23 is decreased in steps .",

    "if the tip is far away from the qpc constriction , we measure the bulk filling factor .",
    "if it approaches the qpc gap , edge channels get reflected one after the other , leading to stepwise reduced conductance values .",
    "the even filling factors are seen as very pronounced plateaus , the odd filling factors are less clearly seen .",
    "this is a manifestation of the relative magnitude of the energy gaps dominating transport : because the separation of landau levels @xmath24 is by orders of magnitude larger than the energy scale for spin - splitting , the zeeman - gap @xmath25 the respective plateaus are more or less pronounced , respectively .",
    "plateaus in the conductance as a function of tip position correspond to the length scale where the system can compensate for a change in the electrostatic potential without changing the filling factor in the qpc .",
    "thus one might assume that the width of the plateaus as measured with sgm is related to the width of the incompressible region in the center of the qpc @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , the first derivative of the measured source - drain current with respect to the tip position corresponds to the current density which flows in the respective edge channel @xmath26 .",
    "the images show that the current density is high in - between the plateaus and zero at the position of the plateaus which can be identified as the incompressible stripes .",

    "we start from a simple model capturing the essentials of the involved potentials and then calculate the regions of constant conductance in scanning gate images .",
    "+        we performed calculations using the saddle point model in a magnetic field by fertig and halperin @xcite ( fh - model ) , where electron - electron interactions are neglected .",
    "we compare the results with the model by chklovskii , matveev and shklovskii ( cms - model ) , where electron - electron interactions are taken into account @xcite . for both methods",
    "the potential landscape of the qpc as influenced by the scanned tip was approximated as a superposition of a saddle point potential ( qpc ) @xcite and a lorentzian potential ( tip ) @xcite + @xmath35    where @xmath36 and @xmath37 describe the curvature of the saddle point potential in @xmath22- and @xmath38- directions as extracted from finite bias measurements at @xmath39 t @xcite , @xmath40 describes the height of the lorentzian potential which is proportional to the voltage applied to the tip , and @xmath41 denotes the half width at half maximum of the tip - induced potential .",
    "if the tip is scanned across the saddle point , the coordinates @xmath42 and @xmath43 describe its position .",
    "+ if the tip is moved close to the qpc , @xmath44 describes a potential landscape , where saddle points which form in between the tip and the qpc walls dominate the current flow .",
    "the positions ( @xmath45 ) of extremal points of these potentials can be found with the condition    @xmath46    expanding the total potential in a power - series around the saddle point found in this way , one obtains    @xmath47    with the terms @xmath48 and @xmath49 which can be identified as the shape - parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 of the saddle point which is formed in - between the tip and the gates . according to @xcite only these shape - parameters of the potential at the saddle point and the relative position of the potential minimum towards the fermi energy are needed to calculate the transmission .",
    "it has been calculated within the fh - model for each position of the tip on a line across the center of the qpc ( green line number 2 in fig .",
    "this model accounts for non - interacting electrons in a potential landscape , however the included spin - splitting uses a g - factor which accounts for many particle interactions , as can be estimated from finite - bias measurements in a magnetic field @xcite . + also the calculations which follow the cms - model use the electrostatic model developed above to calculate the electrostatic width @xmath52 of the channel at the fermi energy @xmath53 mev as a function of tip position",
    "this is the width of the confining parabola in @xmath22-direction at @xmath54 . from this width",
    "the electron density in the center of the channel can be estimated to be @xcite    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the lithographic width of the channel of @xmath57 nm , @xmath58 is taken to be the bulk density of the 2deg as determined by qhe measurements . using the channel width and the density in the center of the channel , the transmission can be calculated for each position of the tip across the center of the qpc ( green line number 2 in fig .",
    "1b ) ) according to eqs .",
    "( 48 ) , ( 50 ) and ( 51 ) in @xcite .",
    "if the tip is placed close to the qpc - gap it is intuitively understandable that the superposition of potentials leads to a modified transmission of current , as the minimum of the confining potential is raised relative to the fermi energy and the width of the channel is also changed .",
    "the results of the fh- and cms - models are compared to experimental traces . in both calculations plateaus",
    "can be interpreted as the result of incompressible stripes , while the regions of finite slope represent the compressible stripes in the channel center .",
    "one can observe the trend that the calculations which follow the fh - model ( red curves in fig .",
    "5 ) overestimate the plateau width and underestimate the width of the sloped regions , thus giving an exaggerated impression of the incompressible stripe width .",
    "on the other hand the cms - model ( orange curves in fig .",
    "5 ) overestimates the width of the sloped regions and greatly underestimates the plateau widths , leading to compressible stripes which are broader than observed experimentally .",
    "our calculations are performed at zero temperature . including the effect of finite temperature would lead to a stronger smearing of the plateaus .",
    "the experiment is found in - between the extreme results of the two models",
    ". this may not be very surprising .",
    "the fh - model is based on non - interacting electrons .",
    "self - consistent calculations @xcite indicate that edge - reconstruction due to screening can not be neglected in the case of smooth gate - defined edges",
    ". however , the cms - model assumes perfect metallic screening by compressible stripes , an assumption that exaggerates the influence of interactions .",
    "in our measurements scanning gate microscopy has proven to be a powerful tool to explore the integer and fractional quantum hall effects , adding to conventional transport experiments the possibility to image in real space .",
    "stripes of constant conductance in the maps of conductance as a function of tip position can be identified as the incompressible regions , which form in the center of the constriction in the quantum hall regime .",
    "their real space and energy distribution can be studied in greater detail .",
    "taking the very local nature of the edge channels into account it seems surprising , that finite bias spectroscopy measurements show unambiguously , that the corresponding energy gaps of incompressible regions of a particular integer filling , here filling factor 2 factor do not depend on the position of the tip in the potential landscape .",
    "putting our results in a theoretical context we can show , that existing analytical theories qualitatively reproduce the results , but have a tendency to overestimate or underestimate screening effects .",
    "methods like sgm which give direct insights into the real space behavior of electron transport can connect the theoretical understanding of edge - channels to the world of experiments .",
