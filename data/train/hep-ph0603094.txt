    "we do not know what mechanism has been chosen by nature to break the electroweak symmetry .",
    "there is a general agreement in the sense that the higgs sector of the standard model is incomplete and new physics must exist at the tev scale in order to explain the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "an appealing possibility is that a new strong interaction breaks the electroweak symmetry through the formation of a condensate of new fermions which is not a singlet of the electroweak symmetry group .",
    "this hypothetical new interaction is generally called technicolor@xcite . in general ,",
    "technicolor models have a rich spectrum of composite pseudoscalar and vector states .",
    "some non - minimal models predict the existence of colored technihadrons such as color octet technirhos and color triplet technipions .",
    "they are the focus of this work .",
    "because technicolor is a strongly coupled theory , it is necessary to use effective methods in order to study its phenomenology . in general , the methods that have been proved useful in the description of the properties and interactions of usual hadrons are also used in the study of technihadrons .",
    "one of such methods is vector meson dominance ( vmd)@xcite . a related , but perhaps more elegant , method for describing such interactions is the so called hidden symmetry .",
    "a realization of this technique applied to a strong electroweak sector is known as the bess model@xcite .",
    "vmd was invented in order to describe the interaction of electrons with hadrons ( the rho meson and pions ) . in this scheme",
    "the electron interacts directly only with the ( proto-)photon while the pion interacts directly only with the ( proto-)rho meson .",
    "the interaction between electrons and pions is made possible by a mixing of the ( proto-)photon with the ( proto-)rho . in a similar way , it is assumed that the normal fermions interacts with technihadrons through a mixing of the standard model gauge bosons with the vector technimesons .",
    "nevertheless , some deviations from complete vmd occur in its original context@xcite .",
    "for example , it has been claimed that the decay of the usual ( qcd ) @xmath0 into a pair of leptons is better described if a direct coupling of the leptons to the @xmath1 is introduced@xcite . on the other hand , in @xcite",
    "it is shown that the introduction of a direct coupling of the photon to the charged pions , allows the abandon of the universality condition in order to obtain a correct pion form factor .",
    "moreover , we know that technicolor dynamics is not like qcd .",
    "all these circumstances motivate us to ask about the meaning of the limits on technirho production at the tevatron when departure from traditional vmd are consired .    in this work",
    "we investigate the consequences of deviations form complete vmd ( which we will call partial vmd ) for the production of a color octet technirho and a pair of color triplet technipions .",
    "the first studies of the color octet technirho phenomenology @xcite were done using a version of vmd ( generalized to color interaction ) based on non - diagonal propagators . in this work ,",
    "we start with a version of vmd which is equivalent to the previous one but is formulated in terms of mass - mixing terms .",
    "as it was previously shown @xcite , the mixing of the color octet technirho with the gluon can be described by the lagrangian :    @xmath2    where @xmath3    this lagrangian is invariant under @xmath4 provided that the fields transform as :    @xmath5    notice that the fields @xmath6 and @xmath7 are not physical fields because they are not mass eigenstates .",
    "we call them the proto - gluon and the proto - technirho , respectively .",
    "the physical fields can be written as :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 as usual , we estimate the value of @xmath9 scaling up the mixing between the photon and the usual rho meson obtained in normal vmd :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the number of technicolors . as usual , we set @xmath13 .    when the lagrangian ( [ eq : l1 ] ) is written in terms of the physical fields , we find that there is no coupling between a color octet technirho and two gluons @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown @xcite that an operator with dimension six exits that restores this coupling .",
    "this operator may be written as :    @xmath14    of course we do not know the value of the constant @xmath15 and hence an important uncertainty exists about the contribution of this operator .",
    "for simplicity , we work in the pessimistic limit assuming that the constant @xmath15 is small enough to make this contribution negligible .",
    "in fact , at the tevatron this term is not important due to the low gluon luminosity at large partonic center - of - mass energies @xcite .",
    "however , this term is crucial for the study of the color octet technirho phenomenology at the lhc . in this case",
    ", a reliable estimation of @xmath15 based on dynamical calculations would be very valuable , but this analysis is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "now we want to couple these fields to quarks . in normal vmd , this is done assuming that the quarks only interacts with the proto - gluon . nevertheless , because both , the proto - gluon and the proto - technirho , transform like gauge fields , it is possible to write a covariant derivative with both fields :    @xmath16\\psi.\\ ] ]    in this way",
    ", we introduce a direct coupling between the quarks and the proto - technirho which strength is measured by the parameter @xmath17 .",
    "this kind of direct coupling can be produced by extended technicolor although in this case it must be proportional to the quark mass and , hence , small .",
    "nevertheless because we do not know exactly all the properties of the underlying ( extended ) technicolor theory , we can not ignore the possibility that a more important coupling can be generated .",
    "when lagrangian ( [ eq : lag_q_gauge ] ) is written in terms of physical fields we obtain :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the usual qcd coupling constant . notice that the coupling of the gluon to quarks is the usual one and it is independent of @xmath17 . on the other hand , the coupling of the physical color octet technirho not only depends on @xmath17 , it vanishes for @xmath20 .",
    "that means that a relative small deviation from normal vmd can produce the decoupling of the physical technirho from quarks .",
    "of course this effect has important consequences for the present mass limits obtained at the tevatron .",
    "in order to evaluate the effects , on the technirho phenomenology , of such a modification of the technirho - quark interaction , we compute ( with the help of lanhep @xcite and calchep @xcite ) the cross section for the resonant production of dijets at the tevatron and we compare it with the experimental limits obtained by the cdf collaboration for a luminosity of @xmath21 pb@xmath22 ( run i)@xcite .",
    "we use the cteq6l @xcite parton distribution function , @xmath23 gev and we implement the following kinematical cuts :    @xmath24    and @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the jet pseudo - rapidity .",
    "as we have already said , we work in the limit where the color octet technirho does not couple to two gluons , hence it is produced only by quark fusion .",
    "for this reason , we do not interpret the experimental results as limits on the color octet technirho mass , but as limits on the @xmath17 parameter .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : x ] .",
    "the curves represent the @xmath27 c.l .",
    "limits on @xmath28 and the region between them is allowed .",
    "the region between the lines is allowed ]    the color - octet technirho remains invisible in this channel if @xmath29 .",
    "for the value of @xmath30 given by equation ( [ eq : sina ] ) , we obtain that the value of @xmath17 needed in order to explain the non - observabilty of the color - octet technirho at the tevatron is @xmath31 .",
    "this value of @xmath17 seems too high because it implies that etc would produce unacceptable big masses for the @xmath32 and @xmath33 quarks .",
    "nevertheless , this numerical result depends of the expression of @xmath30 shown in equation ( [ eq : sina ] ) that was scaled up from qcd .",
    "this procedure is highly dangerous because we know that technicolor s dynamics is not qcd - like .",
    "of coure , we can ask whether , in a realistic model , the mixing angle can be small enough in order to have an @xmath34 compatible with the @xmath32 and @xmath33 quarks . to our knowledge , this is an open question .    on the other hand , in the context of the top quark production in the so called extended bess model @xcite",
    "it has been considered a direct coupling of a color - octet vector resonances ( equivalent to our color - octet technirho ) to quarks of the same order of magnitude of the lower bound of our @xmath17 .",
    "let us turn again our attention to the color octet technirho production by gluon fusion , governed by the dimension 6 operator showed in equation ( [ eq : op6 ] ) .",
    "we have already said that this process is subdominant at the tevatron due to the low gluon luminosity at large partonic center - of - mass energies . nevertheless , it necessary to study its contribution",
    "when the coupling of the technirho to quarks is suppressed . in this case",
    "we compute the production cross using @xmath35 tev and we compare our results with the experimental limits on the production of a color octet technirho , in order to obtain limits on the parameter @xmath15 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : c_2 ] .",
    "the region below the curve is allowed     parameter .",
    "the region below the curve is allowed ]    notice that even for large values of @xmath15 the color octet technirho remains invisible in the dijet spectrum .",
    "we recall that , on the ground of dimensional analysis , the natural value of @xmath15 is of ordrer @xmath36",
    "another interesting process is the production of colored technipions . in this section",
    "we focus on the production of the color triplet ones . in the one family technicolor model , there are four color triplet technipions which we denote generically by @xmath37 .",
    "we assume that all of them have the same mass . in an exact analogy with the previous case",
    ", the lagrangian may be written in terms of our extended covariant derivative :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 in this case , the parameter @xmath40 measures the strength of the direct coupling between the proto - gluon and the color triplet technipion .",
    "the relevant feynman rules for the technipion pair production , written in terms of the physical fields , are shown in table [ tab : fr ] .",
    ".feynman rules relevant for the technipion pair production .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : gr ]    we estimate the pair production of color octet technirhos using only the diagrams a , b and d of fig . [ fig : lhc_diag ] because we expect that the dominant contribution to this process , at the lhc , comes from gluon fusion .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : lhc ] .",
    "it is expected that lhc will have a luminosity of @xmath41 pb@xmath22/yr",
    "so the color octet technirhos must be abundantly produced ( between @xmath42 and @xmath43 events per year in the whole possible mass range ) at the lhc .",
    "of course , a more detailed analysis taking into account realistic detector effects and background must be done , but such a work is beyond the scope of this paper .    ]",
    "we have written down the more general lagrangian ( using operators with dimension up to four ) that describes the interaction of the the color octet technirho with quarks , gluons and colored technipions .",
    "our lagrangian deviate from the usual implementation of vector meson dominance because it includes a direct coupling of the technirho to quarks .",
    "we found that the coupling of the physical technirho to quarks is modified in such a way that it can be significatively suppressed with respect to the usual expectations of normal vmd .",
    "in fact , we compared our predictions to experimental data from the cdf collaboration and we found that a relative small direct coupling can render the color octet technirho invisible .",
    "this effect has consequences also for the pair production of colored technipions , which becomes non - resonant .",
    "nevertheless , the data obtained at the tevatron exclude the existence of color triplet technipions for @xmath44 gev .",
    "finally , we propose to pay attention to the pair production of color octet technirhos as a viable discovery channel at the lhc .",
