    "clusters of galaxies are sites of strong morphological evolution of disk galaxies .",
    "while the fraction of ellipticals in clusters remains relatively unchanged with redshift , the fraction of spirals is 23 times larger in intermediate redshift clusters as compared to the present , with a corresponding decrease in the s0 population ( dressler 1980 ; dressler et al .",
    "this dramatic change in the disk galaxy population since @xmath2 suggests that processes associated with cluster virialisation cause the transformation of spirals to s0s .",
    "although a variety of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the morphological change of cluster disk galaxies , there is growing evidence to suggest that gravitational tidal effects are the predominant mechanism for these transformations .",
    "intermediate redshift clusters have an unexpectedly high proportion of galaxies with unusual morphology , suggestive of merging and tidally interacting systems ( e.g. lavery & henry 1988 ; thompson 1988 ; lavery , pierce & mcclure 1992 ; dressler et al .",
    "1994 ; couch , ellis & sharples 1994 ; oemler , dressler & butcher 1997 ) .",
    "furthermore , the dynamically interacting galaxies seem to be responsible for most of the galaxies that show spectroscopic signs of starbursts ( oemler et al .",
    "1997 ) , as may be expected from the consequences of tidal interactions ( e.g. barton et al .",
    "these tidal effects and gravitational interactions are able to transform spirals to s0s by gas stripping ( e.g. valluri & jog 1991 ) ; by the loss of angular momentum of the disk gas , igniting a powerful central starburst which can assist in the formation of a bulge ( e.g. hernquist & mihos 1995 ; barnes & hernquist 1996 ) ; by tidal heating of the disk stabilising it against gravitational instability and suppressing subsequent star formation ( e.g. gnedin 2003b ) ; by truncation of the halo , halting any further infall of cold gas ( e.g. merritt 1984 ; gnedin 2003b ) ; and by minor merger of two spirals to form an s0 ( e.g. bekki 1998 ) .    the correlation of star formation rate and local projected density which holds for galaxies up to several virial radii from the centres of clusters ( e.g. kodama et al . 2001 , 2003 ; lewis et al . 2002 ; gomez et al .",
    "2003 ) suggests that pre - processing due to tidal forces in galaxy groups is a significant means to change galaxy morphology ( e.g. zabludoff & mulchaey 1998 ) .",
    "however , recent numerical simulations demonstrate that the tidal forces associated with on - going cluster formation and sub - cluster merging also play a major role in the morphological transformation of cluster disk galaxies ( e.g. bekki 1999 ; gnedin 1999 , 2003a , 2003b ) .",
    "changes in cluster disk galaxy morphology were dramatic in the past .",
    "however it is important to consider whether such changes are continuing in clusters at the present epoch .",
    "if morphological transformations of cluster disk galaxies are occuring at the present , albeit on a reduced scale , the processes involved may be studied in much greater detail than is easily possible at higher redshifts .",
    "in fact , there is growing evidence that activity similar to that seen in distant clusters is still on - going at the present epoch . in previous work ( moss &",
    "whittle 1993 ; moss , whittle & pesce 1998 ; moss & whittle 2000 ) , we have shown that the residual spiral population of low - redshift clusters shares characteristics of the more abundant spiral population in higher redshift clusters .",
    "there is an enhancement of circumnuclear starburst emission in cluster spirals as compared to their counterparts in the field .",
    "moreover , a high proportion of the spirals in low - redshift clusters ( e.g. @xmath3 40% in coma ) have a distorted morphology , strongly correlated with circumnuclear starburst emission , typical of tidally disturbed systems .",
    "similarly caldwell & rose ( 1997 ) in a study of 5 nearby clusters , conclude that 15% of early - type galaxies show signs of on - going or recent star formation , characteristic of starburst or post - starburst galaxies , and that the frequency of such galaxies is enhanced as compared to the field .",
    "further evidence that tides and interactions are not solely the provenance of intermediate redshift clusters is provided by conselice and gallagher ( 1999 ) who show that distorted , interacting and fine - scale substructures are common in low - redshift cluster galaxies .",
    "our previous work was an h@xmath0 survey of spirals ( types sa and later ) in 8 low - redshift clusters , which we used to compare the incidence of star formation in clusters and the field .",
    "in the present paper we use the same data set to complete the survey for early - type galaxies , and compare emission for these galaxies between clusters and the field .",
    "such a comparison is of interest for several reasons .",
    "firstly , previous such comparisons have generally concluded that emission is reduced in cluster early - type galaxies as compared to similar galaxies in the field .",
    "however these earlier results have been cast in doubt due to the discovery of a previously unrecognised selection effect ( cf .",
    "biviano et al .",
    "our survey data is expected to be free of this selection effect , and we are able to provide an unbiased comparison of emission in cluster and field early - type galaxies ( see discussion in section [ scfcomp ] below ) . secondly , previous results for low - redshift clusters ( cf .",
    "caldwell et al .",
    "1993 ; caldwell & rose 1997 ) , lead to an expectation of an enhancement of starbursts in the cluster early - type population as compared to the field .",
    "using the present survey data , we can attempt to confirm this prediction . and",
    "finally , data for detected early - type and late - type emission - line galaxies ( elgs ) may be combined to gain further insight into processes affecting cluster galaxies particularly from the kinematical properties of the various elg subgroups .",
    "this last investigation is the topic for a subsequent paper ( moss 2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "identifications of elgs from combined h@xmath0 + [ nii ] emission for early - type galaxies from the h@xmath0 survey data have already been published for abell 1367 ( cf .",
    "moss , whittle & pesce 1998 ) in section [ opsurvey ] we list the early - type galaxies surveyed , and present elg identifications for the remaining 7 clusters . a comparison of emission in field and cluster early - type galaxies is made in section [ scfcomp ] . in section [ emmech ]",

    "the likely origin for this emission is discussed in section [ emmech ] below .",
    "the earliest studies which compared the frequency of emission between field and cluster galaxies were in agreement in finding , _ for a given galaxy morphological type _ , a lower frequency of elgs in clusters ( e.g. osterbrock 1960 , gisler 1978 , dressler et al .",
    "1985 , hill & oegerle 1993 ) . however biviano et al . ( 1997 ) identified a hitherto unsuspected systematic effect which causes an overestimate in the fraction of elgs at fainter magnitudes , due to the bias that operates against the successful determination of redshifts for faint galaxies without emission lines . when field galaxies are on average fainter than the cluster galaxy sample and redshift data are incomplete , this systematic effect works to overestimate the frequency of emission in field as compared to cluster galaxies",
    ".    based on the eso nearby abell cluster survey spectral data ( 5634 galaxies in the directions of 107 cluster candidates ) , biviano et al . concluded that the observed difference in frequency of elgs between field and cluster galaxies could be entirely accounted for by the variation in this frequency with galaxy morphological type , and the differing morphological mix between field and cluster galaxies . by inference ,",
    "there is expected to be no difference in the elg frequency for galaxies of a given morphological type between cluster and field environments , in disagreement with all earlier studies .    for the present prism survey , field and cluster galaxies",
