    "the strong interactions are described by qcd which is a su(3 ) gauge theory . at high energies ,",
    "the coupling constant is small and the theory can be treated with perturbative methods .",
    "when one considers processes involving high energies one finds very good agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results .",
    "however , many important aspects of strong interactions , like mass generation and quark confinement , are not yet completely understood because they involve the low - energy non - perturbative regime of qcd .",
    "so , it is important to look for alternative tools to deal with this non - perturbative regime .",
    "a traditional approach is to use lattice simulations that still do not furnish a complete description of low - energy qcd .",
    "a more recent proposal is to construct phenomenological models for strong interactions based on the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "these models are presently known as ads / qcd .",
    "the simplest model , known as hard wall , consists in using an ads slice with a size related to an infrared cut - off in the gauge theory .",
    "this model was used to estimate hadron masses @xcite .",
    "it presents confinement at zero temperature @xcite and deconfinement at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "another interesting ads / qcd model that leads to linear regge trajectories is known as soft wall . in this model",
    "a non - uniform background dilaton field plays the role of an effective infrared cut - off .",
    "this model was also used to calculate hadronic masses @xcite .",
    "the confinement / deconfinement thermal phase trasition in both models was studied in refs .",
    "it was found that there is a hawking - page gravitational transition such that the space with a black hole is thermally favored at high temperatures , while below some critical ( model - dependent ) value , the thermally favored space is a pure ads .    in this paper",
    "we are going to review some recent progress in using the soft - wall ads / qcd model to compute the spectrum of scalar glueballs in the finite - temperature plasma phase of qcd @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "we consider the ads black - hole spacetime for all temperature values .",
    "as commented above , for temperatures lower than a critical value the black hole is thermodynamically unstable and can be interpreted as a supercooled yang - mills plasma .",
    "the massless scalar field in the 5-d bulk is dual to scalar glueballs in the 4-d boundary theory and the black - hole quasinormal modes correspond to the poles of the retarded correlation function of the operator @xmath1 that creates scalar glueball states . with a numerical analysis , we obtain the real and imaginary parts of the quasinormal mode frequencies as a function of the temperature and the spatial momentum .",
    "the numerical computations at high temperatures were performed using series solutions of the equation of motion . at low temperatures , we found problems with the convergence of the series so it was necessary to use an alternative approach .",
    "we have chosen the breit - wigner method which has been recently applied to compute black - hole quasinormal modes in ref .",
    "we calculate the retarded green s function of scalar glueballs and verify that their poles coincide with the quasinormal mode frequencies .",
    "the imaginary part of the retarded green s function gives the spectral function , which we also analyze in this article .",
    "other recent results in scalar glueballs can be found in @xcite .",
    "for a general review on glueballs see @xcite .",

    "the coordinate @xmath7 is defined in the range @xmath8 and @xmath9 corresponds to the boundary of the spacetime .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 indicates the position of the event horizon which is related to the black - hole hawking temperature @xmath11 by the relation @xmath12 , where @xmath11 also represents the temperature of the boundary field theory .",
    "the @xmath0 black - hole spacetime considered here is associated to three distinct phases , each one corresponding to a range of values of the temperature parameter @xmath13 .",
    "the thermal competition between the black hole and thermal ads space is such that there is a hawking - page transition between spaces at @xmath14 .",
    "this transition is interpreted in the boundary field theory as a confinement / deconfinement phase transition .",
    "the black hole spacetime is the dominant configuration for @xmath15 , while the thermal ads space is the dominant one for low temperature values .",
    "hence , for @xmath16 , the plasma will be in a metastable ( unstable ) phase corresponding to a positive ( negative ) sign of the black - hole specific heat @xmath17 .",

    "the @xmath75-dependent terms are ultraviolet divergent terms that can be removed using a holographic renormalization procedure @xcite .      to find the glueball spectral function we need to compute the imaginary part of the retarded green s function @xmath63 . from equation ( [ greenfunction ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath76 the ratio @xmath77 can be computed by a direct numerical integration of equation ( [ schrod1 ] ) following the steps described , for example , in refs .",

    "the various peaks of @xmath80 correspond to the poles of the retarded green s function @xmath81 and are interpreted as glueball states in the gauge theory . according to the gauge / gravity duality , these poles are associated with the frequencies of the black - hole quasinormal modes .",
    "as it can be seen in the left panel of figure [ spectralfunction ] , the number of glueball states and their lifetimes ( the inverse of the half - width ) decrease with the temperature .",
    "in fact , there is a temperature value ( @xmath82 ) from which on there are no more peaks in the spectral function , characterizing a _ glueball melting_. for a fixed value of temperature @xmath83 , the position and the width of the peaks increase with the momentum @xmath84 , as shown in the right panel of figure [ spectralfunction ] .",
    "two different methods have been used to compute the scalar - field qnm frequencies of the ads black - hole spacetime ( [ background ] ) .",
    "the first one is a series expansion method @xcite , which reduces the problem to finding roots of a polynomial , and it is suitable to find qnm frequencies in the high and intermediate temperature regimes . the second method is based on the computation of breit - wigner ressonances @xcite , and it is efficient to investigate the spectrum for very low temperatures .",
    "the approaches are complementary and present a very good concordance in a wide range of parameter space @xcite .",

    ", the quasinormal modes tend to the spectrum of glueballs at zero temperature : @xmath88 . as the temperature increases the imaginary part of the frequency @xmath89 also increases , while the real part @xmath90 decreases with @xmath83 .",
    "it means that the mass and the decaying time of the glueball excitations decrease with @xmath83 for very low temperature values . in the intermediate- and high - temperature regimes ,",
    "the effect of the dilaton background field is small , and the qnms are essentially the same as those of the black hole solution with @xmath91 @xcite . in particular ,",
    "after reaching some minimum value the real part @xmath90 increases with temperature tending asymptotically to a linear dependence .",
    "in fact , the fractional differences between the cases with and without dilaton reach a value of the order of @xmath92 for @xmath93 , and tend asymptotically to zero in the limit of high temperatures @xcite .",
    "in this article we review recent progress @xcite on the study of the spectrum of scalar glueballs at finite temperature .",
    "the ads / qcd soft - wall model and a black - hole background spacetime have been used to investigate thermal effects on glueball excitations of the plasma phase . as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the black - hole space are associated to an unstable , metastable or stable phase of the dual theory according with the value of the temperature parameter @xmath94 .",
    "it was noticed the existence of peaks in the spectral function , corresponding to glueball states , only for temperatures lower than @xmath95 , a regime for which the black hole is in an unstable phase .",
    "so according to our results , we do not expect to find glueballs in the hot plasma phase ( @xmath96 ) of the qcd .",
    "similar results were recently obtained for scalar @xcite and vector @xcite mesons in the soft - wall model .",
    "it would be interesting to extend these computations to other fields and other ads / qcd models , like those of refs . @xcite .",
    "such analysis could reveal what aspects of our results are specific of the holographic model considered here and what aspects represent general characteristics of glueball excitations in the dual plasma .",
