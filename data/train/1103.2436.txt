    "strange stars are those which are built mainly from self bound quark matter .",
    "the surface density of strange star is equal to the density of strange quark matter at zero pressure ( @xmath0 ) , which is fourteen orders of magnitude greater than the surface density of a normal neutron star .",
    "the central density of these stars is about five times greater than the surface density @xcite .",
    "the existence of strange stars which are made of strange quark matter was first proposed by itoh @xcite even before the full developments of qcd .",
    "later bodmer @xcite discussed the fate of an astronomical object collapsing to such a state of matter . in 1970s , after the formulation of qcd , the perturbative calculations of the equation of state of the strange quark matter was developed , but the region of validity of these calculations was restricted to very high densities @xcite .",
    "the existence of strange stars was also discussed by witten @xcite .",
    "he conjectured that a first order qcd phase transition in the early universe could concentrate most of the quark excess in dense quark nuggets .",
    "he suggested that the true state of matter was strange quark matter .",
    "based on theoretical works of witten on cosmic separation of phases , the transition temperature is approximately @xmath1 , an acceptable qcd temperature @xcite .",
    "witten proposal was that the strange quark matter composed of light quarks is more stable than nuclei , therefore strange quark matter can be considered as the ground state of matter .",
    "the strange quark matter would be the bulk quark matter phase consisting of almost equal numbers of up , down and strange quarks plus a small number of electrons to ensure the charge neutrality .",
    "a typical electron fraction is less than @xmath2 and it decreases from the surface to the center of strange star @xcite .",
    "strange quark matter would have a lower charge to baryon ratio compared to the nuclear matter and can show itself in the form of strange stars @xcite .    just after the collapse of a supernova , a hot strange star may be formed .",
    "a strange star may be also formed from a neutron star and is denser than the neutron star .",
    "if sufficient additional matter is added to a strange star , it will collapse into a black hole .",
    "neutron stars with masses of @xmath3 with rapid spins are theoretically the best candidates for conversion to the strange stars .",
    "an extrapolation based on this indicates that up to two quark - novae occur in the observable universe each day .",
    "besides , recent chandra observations indicate that objects rx j185635 - 3754 and 3c58 may be bare strange stars @xcite .    in this article , we consider a hot strange star born just after the collapse of a supernova . here",
    "we ignore the effects of the presence of electrons , and consider a strange star purely made up of the quark matter consisting of the up , down and strange quarks .",
    "the energy of quark matter is calculated at finite temperature , and then its equation of state is derived . finally using the equation of state of quark matter ,",
    "the structure of strange star at different temperatures is computed by integrating the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations .",
    "different models have been used for deriving the equation of state of quark matter .",
    "therefore there is a great variety of the equations of state for this system . the model which we use is the mit bag model which was developed to take into account the non perturbative effects of quark confinement by introducing the bag constant . in this model ,",
    "the energy per volume for the quark matter is equal to the kinetic energy of the free quarks plus a bag constant ( @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "the bag constant @xmath5 can be interpreted as the difference between the energy densities of the noninteracting quarks and the interacting ones .",
    "dynamically it acts as a pressure that keeps the quark gas in constant density and potential .",
    "this constant is shown to have different values which are @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the initial mit bag model .",
    "since the density of strange quark matter increases from surface to the core of the strange star , it is more appropriate to use a density dependent bag constant rather than a fixed bag constant .    according to the analysis of the experimental data obtained at cern , the quark - hadron transition takes place at about seven times the normal nuclear matter energy density ( @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "recently , a density dependent form has been also considered for @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the density dependence of @xmath4 is highly model dependent . in this article",
    ", the density dependence of @xmath4 will be parameterized , and we make the asymptotic value of @xmath4 approach a finite value @xmath9 @xcite ,    @xmath10    the parameter @xmath11 has constant value which is assumed to be @xmath12 in this work , and @xmath13 is the numerical parameter which is usually equal to @xmath14 , the normal nuclear matter density .",
    "@xmath9 depends only on the free parameter @xmath15 .",
    "we know that the value of the bag constant ( @xmath4 ) should be compatible with experimental data .",
    "the experimental results at cern - sps confirms a proton fraction @xmath16 ( data is from experiment on accelerated pb nuclei ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to evaluate @xmath9 , we use the equation of state of the asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the calculations regarding this can be found in the next section .",
    "we use the equation of state of the asymmetric nuclear matter to calculate @xmath9 . for calculating the equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter",
    ", we employ the lowest order constrained variational ( locv ) many - body method based on the cluster expansion of the energy as follows @xcite .    the asymmetric nuclear matter is defined as a system consisting of @xmath18 protons ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 neutrons ( @xmath21 ) with the total number density @xmath22 and proton fraction @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the number densities of protons and neutrons , respectively . for this system",
    ", we consider a trial wave function as follows , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the slater determinant of the single - particle wave functions and @xmath28 is the a - body correlation operator ( @xmath29 ) which is taken to be @xmath30 and @xmath31 is a symmetrizing operator .",
    "for the asymmetric nuclear matter , the energy per nucleon up to the two - body term in the cluster expansion is @xmath32)=\\frac{1}{a}\\frac{<\\psi\\mid h\\mid\\psi > } { < \\psi\\mid\\psi > } = e_1+e_2 \\cdot\\ ] ] the one - body energy , @xmath33 , is @xmath34 where labels @xmath35 and @xmath36 are used for proton and neutron respectively , and @xmath37 is the momentum of particle @xmath38 .",
    "the two - body energy , @xmath39 , is @xmath40 where @xmath41 + f(12)v(12)f(12 ) \\cdot\\ ] ] in the above equation , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the two - body correlation and nucleon - nucleon potential , respectively . in our calculations",
    ", we use @xmath44 nucleon - nucleon potential @xcite .",
    "now , we minimize the two - body energy with respect to the variations in the correlation functions subject to the normalization constraint . from the minimization of the two - body energy , we obtain a set of differential equations .",
    "we can calculate the correlation functions by numerically solving these differential equations . using these correlation functions ,",
    "the two - body energy is obtained and then we can compute the energy of asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the procedure of these calculations has been fully discussed in reference @xcite .",
    "as it was mentioned in the previous section , the experimental results at cern - sps confirms a proton fraction @xmath16 @xcite , therefore to compute @xmath9 , we proceed in the following manner :    * firstly , we use our results of the previous section for the asymmetric nuclear matter characterized by a proton fraction @xmath16 . by assuming that the hadron - quark transition takes place at the energy density equal to @xmath45 @xcite , we find that the baryonic density of the nuclear matter is @xmath46 ( transition density ) . at",
    "densities lower than this value the energy density of the quark matter is higher than that of the nuclear matter . with increasing the baryonic density",
    "these two energy densities become equal at the transition density , and above this value the nuclear matter energy density remains always higher . * secondly , we determine @xmath47 by putting the energy density of the quark matter and that of the nuclear matter equal to each other .",
    "to calculate the energy of quark matter , we need to know the density of quarks in terms of the baryonic density .",
    "we do this by considering two conditions of beta equilibrium and charge neutrality .",
    "this leads to the following relations @xmath48",
    "@xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the chemical potential and the number density of particle @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "as mentioned , we consider the system as pure quark matter ( @xmath54 ) @xcite . thus according to relation ( [ eq3 ] ) , we have @xmath55 the chemical potential , @xmath52 , at any adopted values of the temperature ( @xmath56 ) and the number density ( @xmath53 ) is determined by applying the following constraint , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the fermi - dirac distribution function @xcite . in the above equation , @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the degeneracy number of the system .",
    "as it is previously mentioned , we consider the total energy of the quark matter as the sum of the kinetic energy of the free quarks and the bag constant ( @xmath4 ) . therefore , the total energy per volume of the quark matter ( @xmath61 ) can be obtained using the following relation , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the kinetic energy per volume of particle @xmath38 , @xmath64    after calculating the energy , we can determine the other thermodynamic properties of the system .",
    "the entropy of the quark matter ( @xmath65 ) can be derived as follows @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the entropy of particle @xmath38 , @xmath68k^2dk.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the helmholtz free energy per volume ( @xmath69 ) is given by @xmath70    the entropy per particle of the quark matter as a function of the baryonic density for two cases of the constant and density dependent @xmath4 at different temperatures are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] . for a fixed temperature",
    ", we see that the entropy per particle decreases by increasing the baryonic density and for all relevant densities , it is seen that the entropy increases by increasing the temperature .    in figs .",

    "we can see that the free energy of the quark matter has positive values for all densities and temperatures .",
    "for all densities , it is seen that the free energy decreases by increasing the temperature .    to obtain the structure of the strange star , the equation of state of the quark matter is needed . for deriving the equation of state ,",
    "the following equation is used , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the pressure .",
    "the pressure of the quark matter versus the baryonic density for two cases of the constant and density dependent @xmath4 are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] .",
    "it is seen that by increasing both density and temperature , the pressure increases .",
    "these figures show that for each temperature , the pressure becomes zero at a specific value of the density .",
    "we see that the density corresponding to zero pressure increases by decreasing the temperature .",
    "compact objects like white dwarfs , neutron stars and strange stars have limiting masses ( maximum mass ) and with a mass more than the limitting value , the hydrostatic stability of the star is impossible . for obtaining the maximum mass of the strange star , we use the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations @xcite ,    @xmath73      [ m(r)+\\frac{4\\pi r^3 p(r)}{c^2}]}{r^2      [ 1-\\frac{2gm(r)}{rc^2}]},\\ ] ]    @xmath74    by using the equation of state found in the previous section , we integrate the tov equations to calculate the structure of the strange star @xcite .",
    "the results of this calculation are given in the following figures and tables .",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] show the gravitational mass versus the central energy density at different values of temperature for two cases of the constant and density dependent @xmath4 . for each value of the temperature ,",
    "these figures show that the gravitational mass increases rapidly by increasing the energy density and finally reaches to a limiting value at higher energy densities .",
    "it is seen that the limiting value of the gravitational mass increases by decreasing temperature . comparing figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] , one concludes that at all temperatures , for the density dependent bag constant , the rate of increasing mass with increasing the central density , at lower values of the central densities , is substantially higher than that of the case for fixed bag constant , especially at zero temperature . in figs .",
    "[ figr90 ] and [ figrbn ] , we have plotted the radius of strange star versus the central energy density for both @xmath75 and density dependent @xmath4 at different temperatures . from figs .",
    "[ fig7]@xmath76[figrbn ] , it can be seen that at each central density , both mass and the corresponding radius increase by decreasing the temperature .",
    "the gravitational mass of strange star is also plotted as a function of the radius for the constant and density dependent @xmath4 in figs . [ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] .",
    "it is seen that for all temperatures , the gravitational mass of strange star increases by increasing the radius and it approaches a limiting value ( maximum mass ) .",

    "it is shown that by decreasing the temperature , the maximum mass of strange star increases .",
    "this behavior is also seen for the radius of strange star versus the temperature .",
    "meanwhile , the central energy density decreases by decreasing the temperature . by comparing tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ]",
    ", we can see that for all temperatures , the maximum mass and the corresponding radius calculated with the constant @xmath4 are less than those calculated with the density dependent @xmath4 .",
