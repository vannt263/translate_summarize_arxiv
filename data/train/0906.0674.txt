    "we take a _ rational polygon _ @xmath4 to be the convex hull of finitely many rational points ,",
    "not all contained in a line . in particular , all of our polygons are convex . given a positive integer @xmath5 , let @xmath6 be the dilation of @xmath7 by @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath8-dimensional case of a well - known result due to e.  ehrhart @xcite states that the number @xmath9 of integer lattice points in @xmath10 is a degree-@xmath8 quasi - polynomial function of @xmath5 with rational coefficients .",
    "that is , there exist periodic functions @xmath11 , @xmath12 , such that , for all positive integers @xmath5 , @xmath13 we call @xmath14 the _ ehrhart quasi - polynomial _ of @xmath7 .",
    "we say that @xmath7 has _ period sequence _",
    "@xmath15 if the minimum period of the coefficient function @xmath16 is @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "the _ quasi - period _ of @xmath14 ( or of @xmath7 ) is @xmath19 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a thorough introduction to the theory of ehrhart quasi - polynomials .",
    "our goal in this note is to examine the properties and possible values of the coefficient functions @xmath16 .",
    "the leading coefficient @xmath20 is always the area @xmath21 of @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath7 is an integral polygon ( meaning that its vertices are all integer lattice points ) , @xmath14 is simply a polynomial with @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the number of integer lattice points on the boundary of @xmath7 .",
    "now , pick s formula determines @xmath21 in terms of @xmath24 and the number @xmath25 of integer lattice points in the interior of @xmath7 . hence , characterizing the ehrhart polynomials of integral polygons amounts to determining the possible numbers of integer lattice points in their interiors and on their boundaries .",
    "this was accomplished by p.  r.  scott @xcite in 1976 :    given non - negative integers @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 for some integral polygon @xmath7 if and only if @xmath29 and either @xmath30 , @xmath31 , or @xmath32 .",
    "however , not all ehrhart polynomials of polygons come from _ integral _ polygons .",
    "hence , the complete characterization of ehrhart polynomials of rational polygons , including the non - integral ones , remains open . to this end",
    ", we define a _ pseudo - integral polygon _ , or _",
    "pip _ , to be a rational polygon with quasi - period  1 .",
    "that is , pips are those polygons that share with integral polygons the property of having a polynomial ehrhart quasi - polynomial . like integral polygons ,",
    "pips must satisfy pick s theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1 ) , so , again , the problem reduces to finding the possible values of @xmath25 and @xmath24 . in section [ sec : nonintegralpips ] , we construct pips with @xmath33 and @xmath25 an arbitrary positive integer .",
    "this construction therefore yields an infinite family of ehrhart polynomials that are not the ehrhart polynomial of any integral polygon .    in section [ sec :",
    "periodsofcoefficients ] , we consider the case where @xmath7 is not a pip .",
    "determining all possible coefficient functions @xmath16 seems out of reach at this time .",
    "however , one interesting question that we will answer here is , what are the possible period sequences @xmath15 ?",
    "p.  mcmullen showed that @xmath17 is bounded by the so - called _",
    "@xmath34-index _ of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "we state his result here in the full generality of @xmath35-dimensional polytopes :    [ thm : mcmullenbound ] given a @xmath35-dimensional polytope @xmath7 and @xmath36 , define the of @xmath7 to be the least positive integer @xmath37 such that all the @xmath34-dimensional faces of @xmath38 contain integer lattice points in their affine span .",
    "then the period @xmath17 of the @xmath34th coefficient of @xmath14 divides @xmath37 .",
    "in particular , @xmath39 .    observe that , by definition , @xmath40 .",
    "conversely , beck , sam , and woods @xcite have shown that , given any positive integers @xmath41 , there exists a polytope with @xmath34-index @xmath37 for @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , mcmullen s bounds on the @xmath17 s are tight for this polytope : @xmath43 .",
    "thus we have that @xmath17 is bounded by the @xmath34-index , and this bound is tight in some cases .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath34-index weakly increases as @xmath34 decreases . seeing this",
    ", one might hope that the @xmath17 s themselves are also required to satisfy some constraints .",
    "however , in section [ sec : periodsofcoefficients ] , we show that , in the case of polygons , @xmath44 and @xmath45 may take on arbitrary values .",
    "since we will be exploring the possible ehrhart quasi - polynomials of polygons , it will be useful to have a geometric means of constructing polygons while controlling their ehrhart quasi - polynomials .",
    "the main tool that we will use are piecewise affine unimodular transformations .",
    "following @xcite , we call these _ @xmath46-homeomorphisms_.    given @xmath47 and a finite set @xmath48 of lines in the plane , let @xmath49 be the set of connected components of @xmath50 . then a homeomorphism @xmath51 is a _ @xmath46-homeomorphism _ if , for each component @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the restriction to @xmath52 of an element of @xmath54 .",
    "the key property of @xmath46-homeomorphisms is that they preserve the lattice and so preserve ehrhart quasi - polynomials .",
    "in particular , we will be using @xmath46-homeomorphisms that act as skew transformations on each component of their domains .",
    "given a rational vector @xmath55 , let @xmath56 be the generator of the semigroup @xmath57 , and define the _ lattice length _ @xmath58 of @xmath59 by @xmath60 .",
    "thus , if @xmath61 , where the fractions are reduced , then we have that @xmath62 .",
    "define the skew unimodular transformation @xmath63 by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the determinant of the matrix whose columns are @xmath59 and @xmath66 ( in that order ) .",
    "equivalently , let @xmath67 be the subgroup of skew transformations in @xmath68 that fix @xmath59 . then @xmath69 is the generator of @xmath67 that translates @xmath70 parallel ( resp .",
    "anti - parallel ) to @xmath59 if the angle between @xmath59 and @xmath70 is less than ( resp .",
    "greater than ) 180 degrees measured counterclockwise .",
    "define the piecewise unimodular transformations @xmath71 and @xmath72 by @xmath73 and @xmath74 finally , given a lattice point @xmath75 and a rational point @xmath76 , let @xmath77 and @xmath78 be the _ affine _ piecewise unimodular transformations defined by @xmath79",
    "there does not exist a 2-dimensional pip @xmath7 with @xmath80 or with @xmath81 .",
    "however , for all integers @xmath2 and @xmath82 , there exists a pip @xmath7 with @xmath83 .    in ( * ?",
    "* theorem 3.1 ) , it was shown that if @xmath7 is a pip , then @xmath84 for @xmath85 . if @xmath86 , this implies that @xmath87 for all @xmath88 , which is impossible because , for example , some multiple @xmath89 of @xmath7 is integral .",
    "hence , @xmath90 when @xmath7 is a pip .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that pips satisfy pick s theorem .",
    "hence , we must have that @xmath91 .",
    "but if @xmath92 and @xmath93 , this yields an area less than or equal to 0 .",
    "since we are not considering polygons contained in a line , this is impossible .",
    "therefore , if @xmath94 , we must have @xmath95 and @xmath96",
    ". now let integers @xmath97 and @xmath2 be given .",
    "we construct a pip @xmath7 with @xmath98 .    if @xmath99 , consider the triangle @xmath100 it was proved in @xcite that @xmath101 is a pip .",
    "let @xmath7 be the union of @xmath101 and its reflection about the @xmath66-axis",
    ". then @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "moreover , @xmath104 ( correcting for points double - counted on the @xmath66-axis ) , so @xmath7 is also a pip .    if @xmath105 , consider the `` semi - open '' triangle @xmath106 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( the upper left of figure [ fig : onevertex ] depicts the case with @xmath107 . ) the ehrhart quasi - polynomial of @xmath101 is evidently a signed sum of ehrhart polynomials , so it also is a polynomial .",
    "we will apply a succession of @xmath46-homeomorphisms to @xmath101 to produce a convex rational polygon without changing the ehrhart polynomial .",
    "( the gray line - segments in figure [ fig : onevertex ] indicate the lines that will be fixed by our skew transformations . )",
    "let @xmath108 .",
    "hence , @xmath109 $ ] .",
    "( see figure [ fig : onevertex ] , upper right . )",
    "now act upon the triangle below the line spanned by @xmath110 ( resp .",
    "@xmath111 ) , with @xmath112 ( resp  @xmath113 ) .",
    "the result is @xmath114 ( see figure [ fig : onevertex ] , lower left ) . at this point",
    ", we have a convex rational polygon with the desired number of interior and boundary lattice points , so the claim is proved .",
    "however , it might be noted that we can get a triangle by letting @xmath115 , yielding @xmath116    a proof of , or counterexample to , scott s inequality for nonintegral pips eludes us .",
    "however , it is easy to show that any counterexample @xmath7 can not contain a lattice point in the interior of its integral hull @xmath117 .",
    "if @xmath7 is a polygon whose integral hull contains a lattice point in its interior , then @xmath7 obeys scott s inequality  that is , @xmath118 unless @xmath119 .",
    "we are given that @xmath120 .",
    "note that @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "since @xmath123 is an integral polygon , it obeys scott s inequalities : either @xmath124 or @xmath125 . in the former case",
    ", we have @xmath126 . in the latter case , we similarly have @xmath127 and @xmath128 , so either @xmath129 or @xmath130 .     of interior points in the case @xmath131 . ]",
    "if @xmath7 is a rational polygon , then the coefficient of the leading term of @xmath14 is the area of @xmath7 , so the first term in the period sequence of @xmath7 is @xmath132 .",
    "however , we show below that no constraints apply to the remaining terms in the period sequence :        fix a positive integer @xmath133 , and let @xmath136 be the line segment @xmath137 $ ]",
    ". then we have that @xmath138 , where the `` constant '' coefficient function @xmath139 has minimum period @xmath133 .",

    "more strongly , we have the following :    [ lem : coeffsofrectangleunionintegral ] suppose that a polygon @xmath7 is the union of @xmath148 $ ] and an integral polygon @xmath149 such that @xmath150)$ ] is a lattice segment .",
    "then @xmath151 has minimum period @xmath133 and @xmath152 .",
    "any integral polygon has period sequence @xmath153 , so we may suppose that either @xmath154 or @xmath155 .",
    "our strategy is to construct a polygon @xmath156 with period sequence @xmath157 and a triangle @xmath158 with period sequence @xmath159",
    ". we will then be able to construct a polygon with period sequence @xmath160 for @xmath161 by gluing @xmath156 and @xmath158 along an integral edge .          to show that @xmath156 has period sequence @xmath157 , we subdivide @xmath156 into a rectangle and three triangles as follows ( see left of figure [ fig : coefficientperiodsconstruction ] ) : @xmath164 let @xmath165 .",
    "write @xmath166 and @xmath167",
    ". then @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "let @xmath170 ( see right of figure [ fig : coefficientperiodsconstruction ] ) . though @xmath171 was formed from unimodular images of pieces of @xmath156 , we do not quite have @xmath172 .",
    "this is because each point in the half - open segment @xmath173 $ ] has two pre - images in @xmath156 .",
    "since this segment is equivalent under a unimodular transformation to @xmath140 $ ] , the correct equation is @xmath174    let @xmath175 .",
    "then @xmath101 is an integral triangle intersecting @xmath176 along a lattice segment , and @xmath177 .",
    "hence , by lemma [ lem : coeffsofrectangleunionintegral ] , @xmath178 has minimum period @xmath133 , and so , by equation , @xmath179 also has minimum period @xmath133 .",
    "it remains only to show that @xmath180 has minimum period @xmath132 .",
    "again , from , we have that @xmath181 from lemma [ lem : coeffsofrectangleunionintegral ] , we know that @xmath182 .",
    "therefore , by , @xmath180 is identically @xmath132 .",
    "we now construct a triangle with period sequence @xmath183 for integral @xmath155 .",
    "let @xmath184 mcmullen s bound ( theorem [ thm : mcmullenbound ] ) implies that the minimum period of @xmath185 is @xmath132 .",
    "hence , it suffices to show that the minimum quasi - period of @xmath186 is @xmath134 .",
    "observe that @xmath158 is equivalent to @xmath187 under a unimodular transformation .",
    "hence , one easily computes that @xmath188 .",
    "note that among the poles of this rational generating function are primitive @xmath134^th^ roots of unity .",
