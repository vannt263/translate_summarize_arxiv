    "radiative capture reaction rate far below the coulomb barrier is an essential input for quantitative understanding of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis @xcite .",

    "there are also a few three - body processes of significance for which experimental measurements are not feasible .",
    "theoretical evaluation of the radiative capture reaction rate is thus important .",
    "the radiative capture rate is composed of two distinct contributions , resonant and nonresonant processes .",
    "a potential model is often employed for the theoretical evaluation of the nonresonant capture rate . for two - body radiative capture processes ,",
    "it is a routine procedure once the model potential is given .",

    "one then calculates the capture reaction rate as a function of temperature by integrating the cross section over the collision energy with an appropriate boltzmann weight",
    ".    theoretical evaluation of radiative capture reaction rate for three - body processes is a much more difficult problem .",
    "it is well recognized that the triple - alpha radiative capture reaction to form @xmath1c is a key process to produce heavy elements  @xcite . at a temperature above 0.1 gk , a resonance state of @xmath2 of @xmath1c which is known as the hoyle state  @xcite contributes dominantly . below 0.1 gk ,",

    "it is by no means obvious how to define theoretically the cross section of the triple - alpha radiative capture process , because an analytic asymptotic form of the scattering wave function of three charged - particles is not known .",
    "one also needs to solve the three - body problem in a huge spatial region for reactions far below the coulomb barrier , since the alpha particles pass through a barrier for a long distance to penetrate it .    in ref .",

    "this procedure allows one to avoid the difficulty of calculating scattering solution for three charged - particles .",
    "however , a number of bound states need to be calculated in their approach .    in this paper , we propose a new computational method for the radiative capture rate .",
    "we will show that the radiative capture rate as a function of temperature may be calculated directly by solving an equation which looks like a time - dependent schrdinger equation along the imaginary - time axis .",
    "the new method requires neither any solutions of scattering problem nor any bound state solutions except for a final bound state wave function after the capture .",
