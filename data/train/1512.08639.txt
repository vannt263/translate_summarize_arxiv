    "generally speaking , pbhs of mass @xmath0 were formed at an epoch when the total mass enclosed within the hubble radius was of order @xmath0 , if we neglect critical behavior in gravitational collapse , mass loss due to hawking evaporation , and mass gain due to accretion .",

    "thus , pbhs can be seen as a probe into the early universe , high energy physics , and quantum gravity . in particular , since pbhs can convey information about primordial fluctuations , the observational constraint on the abundance of pbhs is complementary to the cosmic microwave background anisotropy observation .    to convert primordial fluctuations in a given cosmological scenario to the abundance of pbhs",

    "the process of pbh formation entails big bang , gravitational collapse , apparent horizon , relativistic fluid , primordial fluctuations and cosmological expansion .",

    "they also discussed the time evolution of the solutions , restricting themselves to the marginally bound case which is not relevant to the cosmological growing perturbation .",
    "it is important to see the condition for the occurrence and non - occurrence of naked singularities and its physical interpretation in the context of the nonlinear evolution of cosmological primordial fluctuations .",
    "we adopt the simultaneous big bang condition to extract a growing mode of adiabatic perturbations .",
    "the formation and evolution of cosmological nonlinear perturbations have been analyzed on the same grounds  @xcite .",
    "for these nonlinear cosmological perturbations , we investigate the formation of black holes and cosmological voids against the formation of shell - focusing and shell - crossing singularities and see how the deviation from spherical symmetry affects these physical situations for the first time .",
    "we also discuss the link between the current result and the physical interpretation by khlopov and polnarev  @xcite that shell - focusing naked singularities may be physically regarded as the onset of strong pressure gradient force .",
