    "two branches of computational physics , namely macro - scale continuous fluid dynamics and micro - scale molecular dynamics simulation , never stop efforts in extending their power to wider scales . for example , molecular dynamics simulation has been successfully applied to model mesoscopic three dimensional rayleigh - benard convection@xcite and by the same token fluid dynamics has been applied to simulate nano - scale convection behavior in electrochemical reactions@xcite . however , even though the proliferation of multiprocessor computers and parallel computation techniques have inspired the ambition of computer scientists , molecular dynamics simulation is still an torment for most large scale systems like macromolecules self - assembling problem whose size is micrometer scale comprising of hundreds of millions of atoms and whose phase transition time is longer than @xmath0 nanoseconds@xcite . in this circumstance",
    "coarse - grained ( cg ) method , as a promising way , and in some situations the only way@xcite , of bringing molecular dynamics simulation into large applications on multi-@xmath1s time scale or multi-@xmath1 m length scale has therefore been discussed extensively recent years@xcite .",
    "different from all - atom ( aa ) molecular dynamics , cg method usually subsumed high frequency intra - molecular vibrations into coarse grained sites . the low resolution model is then simulated in a carefully designed effective force field .",
    "this procedure has been proved available for protein dynamics@xcite , protein - membrane interaction simulation @xcite as well as protein folding@xcite .",
    "usually , the construction of a cg model includes three steps .",
    "the first one is to select the mapping from aa coordinates to cg coordinates , simply denoted as @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 represent the high - dimentional conformation vectors in aa and cg models , respectively .",
    "for example , while @xmath3 is the position vector of all hydrogen and oxygen atoms of waters , @xmath4 can be chosen as the position vector of the center of mass of water molecules , thus @xmath5 is a linear function of @xmath3 .",
    "it is also possible to design another mapping , for example , if selecting the spatial density of molecules , @xmath6 , as the coarse - grained coordinates , @xmath4 , where @xmath7 is the usual @xmath8dimensional spatial vector , we may bridge molecular systems to macroscopic continuous field models .",
    "the second step is to presume a formula as effective force field of cg model with some free parameters , @xmath9 , _",
    "e.g. _ , a pair additive interaction in one - site cg water model , @xmath10 . here",
    "values of the pairwise potential function @xmath11 at different pair distance @xmath12 are free parameters , @xmath13 is the distance between the @xmath14th and @xmath15th cg sites .",
    "if @xmath6 is chosen as the @xmath4 in continuous field model , @xmath9 might be a density functional as @xmath16  @xcite with the kernel @xmath17 as parameters .",
    "the final step of constructing cg models is to determine the free parameters @xmath18 by minimizing the difference between cg model and the referenced aa system . while the first two steps are usually set based on afore experience and knowledge of the studied systems , many different coarse - graining techniques have been developed to focus on optimizing @xmath9 in the @xmath18 parameter space , based on different measurement of inter - model distance .",
    "a quite recent review is shown in reference  @xcite . among of them ,",
    "the traditional coarse - graining methods calculate the distance based on equilibrium averages of some chosen physical quantities , such as the radius distribution function ( rdf ) of cg sites  @xcite , @xmath19^{2 } \\rho(r ) d r ,   \\label{distance - trad}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the ensemble averaged rdf of cg sites in the cg / aa model , and @xmath21 is an optional weight function .",
    "the traditional cg method has already been widely applied in various systems  @xcite .",
    "two known algorithms , iterative inverse boltzmann  @xcite and reverse monte carlo  @xcite are applied in the traditional cg techniques to optimize cg force field .",
    "the iterative inverse boltzmann method , introduced by reith",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite iteratively adjust inter - particle interactions based on an idea gas assumption which declares the rdf of cg sites is equal to the exponential of the pairwise potential function , explicitly @xmath22 $ ] for the pairwise potential function @xmath11 and the equilibrium averaged rdf @xmath23 of cg sites .",
    "the assumption can be exact only in the low density limit .",
    "but fortunately the iterative inverse boltzmann has been proved to be valid for dense systems like lennard - jones liquid  @xcite , tip3p water  @xcite and polymer systems  @xcite .",
    "similar to the iterative inverse boltzmann method , the reverse monte carlo ( rmc ) method  @xcite , also consists of iterative adjustment of interactions , only that modification to potential function in each rmc iteration cycle is determined by the steepest descent algorithm , which calculates the derivatives of the equilibrium averages of the chosen physical properties to update the @xmath11 .",
    "rmc has been used to determine ion - ion interaction in aqueous nacl solutions  @xcite , to study diffusive dynamics of liquid water  @xcite , to model behavior of mesoscopic lipids and lipids assembly in water  @xcite and to study bilayer membrane  @xcite .",
    "obviously , the optimized cg model based on the traditional cg method is dependent on the selection of physical quantities . to avoid ( or depress ) the dependence of estimating @xmath24 on the selection of physical quantities , an alternative cg method is to match whole the free energy surface of the aa model in the cg conformational space  @xcite , which is defined as , @xmath25 \\delta(x - x(q ) ) dq,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the boltzmann s constant and @xmath27 is temperature , @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 is the potential energy surface of the aa system , @xmath30 is the dirac-@xmath31 function .",
    "thus the distance between the cg model and aa system could be defined as @xmath32^{2 } \\rangle_{\\rho}$ ] , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is an optional probability density . by calculating values of the free energy @xmath35 at many sampled cg conformations , @xmath36 , based on a jump - in - sample algorithm  @xcite , we estimated the distance as @xmath37^{2}$ ] and optimized effective cg force field of tetrahedral molecular liquids  @xcite .",
    "the free - energy matching method is expected to better take into account the overall characteristic of the aa system in comparison with the traditional cg methods  @xcite , however more computational costs are usually required in the free - energy matching method than the latter .",
    "recently , by matching the total aa force on cg sites , a new cg method , force matching method  @xcite , has been presented and widely tested in various of systems ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the force matching method closely related to an improved variant of the free - energy matching cg method . replacing to the very time - consuming calculation of @xmath38",
    ", we may calculate the gradients of free energies , @xmath39 , for example , based on the blue - moon ensemble simulations  @xcite , and define the distance between cg and aa models as @xmath40 to optimize cg force field .",
    "while the cg mapping function @xmath2 is linear , in principle , the force matching method can give the same results of the cg method by matching the gradients of free energy .",
    "the force matching cg method ( or the more general free - energy - gradient matching method ) significantly decreases the required computational costs in comparison with the free - energy matching method , but similarly keeps the accuracy of the latter .    in the work we present a new methodology to optimize effective cg force",
    "filed based on matching the equilibrium probability density of aa system in the cg conformational space , named as distribution matching method .",
    "the ratio of the probability density function in cg model to that in aa model is expanded on a set of complete and linearly independent conformational functions ( _ i.e. _ , basis functions ) .",
    "we find the equilibrium fluctuation of the ratio of probability density functions accurately measures the distance between cg and aa models , since the fluctuation provides an upper limit of the error of reproducing aa equilibrium average of any conformational function in the cg model .",
    "the distribution matching cg technique has the almost similar computational cost as the traditional cg method but takes into account the overall characteristic of the free energy surface @xmath35 of aa systems , so it has the advantages of both the traditional cg method and the free - energy - based methods ( matching free energy or its gradient or force ) .",
    "this article is organized as follows , in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we first introduce the theories on definition of consistency between cg force field and aa force field , and then give the formulas of distribution matching inherited from consistency condition .",
    "after , details of an expansion of distribution function are outlined , two ways of applying the expansion to the distribution matching method are then present and compared in this section .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] starts from an application of the distribution matching method for water model .",
    "while groups of atoms in a aa system are mapped as cg sites , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath2 , the interaction among cg sites , @xmath9 , need to be optimized to minimize the difference between cg model and the aa system .",
    "it possibly requires @xmath9 matches the free energy surface @xmath35 in whole the cg conformational space @xmath4 , or more practice , in important ( and interesting ) cg conformational regions of @xmath4 .",
    "we define a weight function as ratio of two probability density functions , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the equilibrium probability density of the cg / aa model in the @xmath4 space , for example , @xmath43 and @xmath44 in canonical ensemble .",
    "the weight function @xmath45\\}$ ] characterizes the difference of the cg model from the aa models .",
    "considering the fact @xmath46 for any conformational function @xmath47 , the weight function can be expanded as a series of complete basis functions @xmath48",
    "@xcite , @xmath49 here @xmath50 denotes the ensemble average in the aa / cg model , @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the inverse covariance matrix of the basis functions which obey the equality , @xmath53 while @xmath54 is the covariant matrix of the basis functions in the aa model .",
    "we used einstein summation notation for greek superscript or subscript here and in the text below of the paper if without explicit expression .",
    "the fact @xmath55 is explicitly wrote out in eq .",
    "( [ fee : expansion ] ) .",
    "we can define the difference from the aa model to cg model as the equilibrium fluctuation of the weight function in the aa model , @xmath56 because @xmath57 gives the upper limit of the relative error of the ensemble means of any variable @xmath47 , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the fluctuation of @xmath48 in the aa system .",
    "it is worth to mention that @xmath57 is not a normal distance , since it is not symmetric about @xmath60 and @xmath61 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath62 .",
    "it is not difficult to define a symmetric distance , such as , @xmath63 , where @xmath64/2 $ ] is the average probability density and @xmath65 .",
    "for theoretical view points , it might be more robust to use the symmetric distance @xmath66 in optimization of cg effective force field .",
    "however , the minimization of @xmath67 is similar to that of @xmath68 except needing slightly more computational cost in comparison with the latter . in the current paper",
    ", we only use the @xmath68 to illustrate the optimization of cg force field , it is direct to extend the method based on the symmetric distance . actually , the only difference among the three distances is that the inverse covariance matrix @xmath69 are estimated in different equilibrium conformational samples , such as @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 . here",
    "@xmath73 .",
    "while the basis set @xmath48 is complete , eq.([fee : expansion ] ) is exact and independent on the applied cg potential @xmath74 , thus we have an analyzed expansion of free energy surface in ( any ) high - dimensional @xmath4 space , @xmath75 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & u(x ) - k_{b } t \\ln [ 1 - g_{\\mu\\nu}(cg ) a^{\\mu } \\ ; \\delta_{cg}a^{\\nu}(x ) ] .   % \\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx&u(x ) + k_{b } t g_{\\mu\\nu}(cg ) a^{\\mu } \\ ; \\delta_{cg",

    "although the expansion can not be expected to be accurate in every where of @xmath4 space , @xmath76 is able to be estimated very well from eq.([eq : s2 ] ) , if many ( but not very large number of ) basis functions are applied in the expansion .",
    "we can chose interesting physical quantities of the system as much as possible to capture the difference between the aa to cg models .",
    "the linear correlated basis functions are automatically discarded by @xmath77 in eq.([eq : s2 ] ) .",
    "in addition , since we estimate @xmath77 in a finite - size conformational sample of the aa system , the number of independent basis functions is not more than the size of the sample .",
    "actually , unless the difference between aa and cg models is very huge , the number of required basis functions is far smaller than the size of sample in estimate of @xmath76 .",
    "more detailed discussion about the completeness of basis function in estimate of @xmath76 is discussed in the reference  @xcite where we applied the same expansion in structuring and sampling conformational space of complex systems .",
    "now the difference between two models ( actually , two finite - size equilibrium conformational samples ) is calculable , the only thing left for constructing cg models is to minimize @xmath78 by consecutively adjusting the cg force field @xmath79 . if any one of basis functions is linearly depend on other basis functions , the covariant matrix @xmath80 will not have a full rank , then the inverse covariant matrix will be singular .",
    "in this situation , the basis functions can be rearranged so that linearly dependent functions can be eliminated .",
    "to do this we orthonormalize basis functions in the way that @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a set of orthonormalized functions that have a diagonalized covariant matrix @xmath83 whose diagonal elements is either zero ( or very small ) or unity . the orthonormal functions @xmath84 with zero ( or very small ) eigenvalues can be safely cast away in that they are linearly dependent on the other basis functions .",

    "this is largely because pressure difference is numerically independent on rdf differences .",
    "correction to the potential at this moment is roughly divided into two parts , one is the fine tune which add short wave length modification function @xmath204 to pair interaction , say @xmath205 ; the other part is the global shift which change the potential function significantly while holding the fine structure .",
    "one of the well known dilemmas in cg techniques is that the pressure correction would lead to less accuracy in representing of other properties@xcite such as isothermal compressibility and conformance of rdf .",
    "this effect is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : s2ext ] ) : when pressure consistency is taken into account , @xmath78 increases from @xmath183 to the value of @xmath206 .",
    "however on the other hand , cg with pressure correction shows greater extensibility than that without pressure correction at temperature @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "it indicates the additional pressure correction makes the cg model be more consistent with the aa system .",
    "another appealing feature fig .",
    "( [ fig : s2ext ] ) shows is that in the temperature region of @xmath209 , @xmath210 and @xmath211 , both of which are very small value . especially that in @xmath212 , @xmath78 is smaller that the best case of @xmath213 . since the rdf corresponding to @xmath214 is almost indecipherable , we can safely declare that @xmath212 is the effective temperature region for the potential obtained from our method .",
    "the present work introduces a new methodology , the distribution matching method , to optimize cg force field effectively and efficiently .",
    "consistency condition between cg and detailed atomistic model is given and reinterpreted as a requirement of matching of distributions thus equilibrium average of a set of sufficient and independent basis functions through the distribution expansion analysis .",
    "based on the analysis , we proposed a two steps protocol to construct effective cg force filed .",
    "the first step is to expand phase spaces differences between cg and aa model as linear combination of basis functions . in this part orthogonalization technique",
    "is suggested to avoid singularity led by linear dependencies among basis functions .",
    "the second step is to minimize the defined difference in whole the conformational space .",
    "two different minimization approaches are introduced in this part , namely the conjugate gradient approach and the direct iteration approach .",
    "both two approaches are demonstrated in the case of being applied to fit pairwise additive force field . with aforementioned two steps protocol",
    "we have been fully able to construct effective pair additive force field for cg models .",
    "we test this statement by applying the formulas to building one site model for tip3p water model . considering that pressure consistency",
    "is required in some situations we propose a method to correct pressure in accordance previous two steps protocol .",
    "it is enlightened by constraint optimization techniques . by adding a penalty item to the definition of phase space difference we are able to limit the pressure deviance .",
    "the effectiveness of pressure correction method is also verified in one - site cg water model .",
    "the present methodology is encouraging , its capability to reverse distributions of arbitrary functions defined in cg coordinate space indicates a wide applications in multi - scale simulations .                                                                             and @xmath193 in the first @xmath215 iteration steps using different optimizing algorithm .",
    "in the figure , the subscript notion _ conj _ refers to the conjugate gradient method ; _ direct _ means the direct iteration method ( see text ) . at the @xmath215th step , @xmath198 is @xmath192 with the conjugate gradient method , is @xmath216 with the direct iteration method , meanwhile @xmath217 is @xmath218 and @xmath219 , scaledwidth=50.0% ]     and density of @xmath220 .",
    "the inset shows an enlarged region of the first peak .",
    "the @xmath78 between the cg model without the pressure correction ( cg - npc ) and the tip3p model is @xmath183 , and @xmath193 between pressure corrected cg model ( cg - pc ) and tip3p model is about @xmath221.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]         from different methods , using versus not using pressure correction in particular , and then is tested in other temperatures from @xmath224 to @xmath225 .",
    "the results are then compared to tip3p simulations at the same temperature so as to calculate the free energy distances ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the circle line shows the dependence of @xmath78 on temperature for non - pressure correction pair potential , its value at @xmath226 is @xmath183 ; the triangle line show the results of the potential with pressure correction , its minimum value is @xmath206.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]"
