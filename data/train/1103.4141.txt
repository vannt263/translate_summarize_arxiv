    "@xcite these ripples appear clearly when water dripping from the top of the stick and gutter spreads effectively and covers the entire ice surface uniformly .",
    "the latent heat from the ice - water interface to the environment through the water film must be released during the freezing process .",
    "consequently , a negative temperature gradient develops ahead of the growing ice beneath the water film and the water is a supercooled .",

    "roughness height increases with increasing air temperature and lwc , whereas airspeed has little effect on roughness height .",
    "roughness spacing is of the order of a millimeter , decreases with increasing airspeed , and increases with increasing air temperature and lwc .",

    "the initial aufeis morphologies , characterized by wavelike or terraced forms , are shown in figure  [ fig : ripples ] ( d ) .",
    "their roughness spacing and height was found to vary with slope and wind speed . as the slope increases , their roughness spacing decreases and roughness height increases .",

    "the interactions between hydrodynamics , water chemistry , calcium carbonate precipitation and carbon dioxide degassing constitute a complex pattern formation of travertine terracing .",
    "@xcite the relationships between slope , discharge , terrace wavelength , depth and height are discussed by pentecost : @xcite inter - dam distances increase with large discharge , where dam is defined as terraces that are filled with water , forming pools and lakes .",
    "pools are shorter on steep slopes , instead height is larger .",
    "interestingly , variations of the inter - dam distances and ice ripple wavelength with slope show the same trend ( see fig . 5 in ref . and",

    "+     we can see common features for the surface roughness characteristics such as roughness spacing and height among phenomena mentioned above . for the first example , a theoretical model of the origin of ripples on icicles",

    "@xcite for the second example , in order to explain experimental results on glaze ice roughness diameters , accreted on naca 0012 airfoil leading edges reported by shin@xcite , tsao and rothmayer developed a high reynolds number triple - deck theory @xcite to describe the interaction between the air boundary layer , water film and glaze ice sheet .",
    "@xcite a novel broad - band ice instability mode was found in regimes with simultaneous air and wall cooling , but there was no well - defined maximum amplification rate wavenumber ( or equivalently , wavelength ) . to overcome this issue , the gibbs - thomson effect was introduced to stabilize the smallest scale icing disturbances . however , the length scale predicted by their theory was much smaller than the roughness spacing of the order of millimeters observed in the experiments of shin .",
    "@xcite for the third and final examples , the quantitative morphology and size distribution of aufeis and travertine terraces as a function of parameters such as slope , water flux and airspeed have not yet been studied in detail .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to construct a comprehensive model to elucidate common features for the roughness characteristics described above .    in this paper , in [ sec : model ] we propose a theoretical model to explain the effects of water supply rate , plane slope and wind speed on the roughness spacing and height of an initial aufeis ( icings ) , from the morphological instability of growing crystal under gravity and air shear stress driven water film . in a previous ice growth model",

    "@xcite in another model , water is driven by air shear stress alone , @xcite but the model is valid on a horizontal surface .",
    "however , by combining the two driving forces , the resulting model becomes more complex than the previous ones because air and water flows and temperature fields are highly coupled with the water film thickness .",
    "therefore , a numerical method is proposed to solve the governing equations for an air - water - ice multi - phase system . in [ sec : randd ] , the experimental results concerning the roughness characteristics of the initial aufeis observed by streitz and ettema @xcite will be explained theoretically . it will also be shown that the growth conditions of the ice - water interface disturbances are strongly affected by variable air stresses exerted on the water - air interface by the airflow .",
    "crucial evidence of the importance of such air shear stress disturbances will be shown by comparing theoretically calculated amplification rates of the ice - water interface disturbance with the ice surface roughness heights observed by streitz and ettema .",

    "in the experiments of streitz and ettema @xcite for an initial formation of aufeis on an inclined plane shown in figure  [ fig : ripples ] ( d ) , a wind tunnel set up in a refrigerated laboratory was designed to tilt only downwards , allowing the water to flow as a thin sheet driven by gravity and wind drag .",

    "these in turn affect the flow and temperature distributions in the water layer . in response to this change",

    "the air boundary layer , the unfrozen water and the ice substrate become a complex air - water - ice multi - phase system .",

    "m / s in figures  [ fig : parameters ] ( g ) and ( h ) , since the values @xmath321 , @xmath322 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 are comparable and small , the amplitude of the water - air interface becomes large , as shown by the solid curve of @xmath252 m / s in figure  [ fig : qa - ga-xi - ka ] ( f ) . on the other hand , for @xmath305 m",
    "/ s in figures  [ fig : parameters ] ( g ) and ( h ) , the values @xmath149 and @xmath150 are much greater than the values @xmath321 and @xmath322 .",
    "hence , the effect of the shear stress disturbances on the water - air interface is more dominant than that of gravity and surface tension .",
    "moreover , the amplitude of the water - air interface for small @xmath226 values becomes small compared to that for @xmath252 m / s , as shown by the solid curve of @xmath305 m / s in figure  [ fig : qa - ga-xi - ka ] ( f ) .",
    "this causes the decrease of @xmath327 or roughness height with @xmath7 in figure  [ fig : amp - parameters ] ( b ) .",
    "as the wavenumber increases , the term @xmath322 becomes the most dominant one , and the water - air interface tends to be flat because of the restoring force due to the surface tension , as shown in figures  [ fig : qa - ga-xi - ka ] ( d ) and ( f ) .",
    "a theoretical model to explain the roughness characteristics in an initial aufeis ( icings ) formation observed in the experiments of ref . was proposed , from a new morphological instability of an ice surface during growth under a supercooled water film driven by gravity and air drag . a numerical method to solve complex air - water - ice multi - phase system , where air and water flows and temperature fields are highly coupled with water film thickness ,",
    "was also proposed . using linear stability analysis , roughness characteristics such as roughness spacing and height of the ice - water interface",
    "were derived for various water supply rates , plane slopes and airspeeds .",
    "major findings are as follows : ( 1 ) the roughness spacing decreases with increasing slope and airspeed , whose trends are in qualitative agreement with the experimental results of ref . . moreover , the roughness spacing was found to increase with the water supply rate .",
    "in particular , roughness spacing depends mainly on water layer thickness .",
    "( 2 ) the upstream propagation of the ice - water interface disturbance was predicted .",
    "( 3 ) the amplification rate of the ice - water interface disturbance increases with slope , but decreases with airspeed . in the linear stability analysis",
    ", the amplification rate of the ice - water interface disturbance is expected to be relevant with the initial roughness height . in the experiments ,",
    "@xcite the roughness height increased with slope , but decreased with airspeed .",
    "therefore , the theoretical results herein are consistent with the experimental ones .",
    "also , the amplification rate was found to increase with the water supply rate for low airspeeds , which suggests that roughness height increases with water supply rate .",
    "the most important finding of this study is that in order to predict the roughness height at higher airspeeds , the influence of air shear stress disturbances on the water - air interface must be taken into account .",
    "otherwise , the disturbed part of the convective heat transfer rate at the water - air interface is not correctly predicted , and the roughness height is erroneously estimated .",
    "the roughness characteristics shown in the initial aufeis formation have common features with the roughness features observed in glaze icing and geological pattern formations . in order to extend the present model to practical aircraft and structural icing problems",
    ", we have to consider air , water and ice interactions near the stagnation point of objects , as shown in figure  [ fig : ripples ] ( c ) . in that case , water film on the object is formed by unfrozen impinging water droplets , the free stream velocity is not constant around the object and the angle changes locally along the object .",
    "therefore , the water supply rate @xmath205 used in the current model must be replaced by liquid water content ( lwc ) , and the values lwc , @xmath7 and @xmath4 must change locally along the position of the object . furthermore , gravity impedes the supercooled water flow due to air shear stress on the upper side of the object , while it magnifies the effect of air shear stress on the lower side of the object .",
    "in addition to this asymmetry , it will be necessary to consider heat conduction into the object beneath the ice sheet .",
    "although the method and fundamental ideas developed here can be applied to other phenomena by extending the current model , further research and laboratory experiments are necessary to validate our model proposed in this paper .",
