    "the ginzburg - landau theories have had an enormous influence on both physics and mathematics .",
    "physicists employ ginzburg - landau models in modeling superconductivity , superfluidity , and , more recently , for rotating bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , all systems which present quantized defects commonly known as vortices . in mathematics , starting with the work by bethuel , brezis & hlein @xcite , many powerful methods have been developed to study the physical london limit , _",
    "i.e. _ , as the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath3 tends to @xmath1 .",
    "this limit corresponds to the thomas - fermi regime in bec , and to an analogous regime in superfluids where the characteristic length scale @xmath0 is very small . in a two - dimensional setting , vortices are essentially characterized as isolated zeroes of the order parameter carrying a winding number , and in the london limit as point defects where energy concentration occurs . the question of whether energy minimizers develop vortices , where they appear in the domain , and how many there should be ( for given boundary conditions , constant applied fields or angular velocities ) has been analyzed in many contexts and parameter regimes .    in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the following ginzburg - landau energy , arising for instance in the physical context of a rotating superfluid . considering a bounded simply connected domain @xmath4 , a smooth vector field @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    ", we define the functional @xmath8 identifying @xmath9 with the complex plane @xmath10 , we denote by @xmath11 the _ pre - jacobian _ of @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath13-vector field @xmath14 may also be written as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the standard inner product of two complex numbers , viewed as vectors in  @xmath9 .    in the case of uniform rotation , that is @xmath17 and with @xmath18 a disk , serfaty @xcite studied minimizers of a closely related functional ( see remark  [ relfunct ] ) to determine the critical value @xmath19 of the angular speed @xmath20 at which vortices first appear ( see also @xcite for becs ) .",
    "she finds that minimizers acquire vorticity at @xmath21 for an explicitly determined constant @xmath22 . in a series of papers , culminating with the publication of the research monograph @xcite , sandier & serfaty developed powerful tools to study vortices in ginzburg - landau models .",
    "although they primarily work with the full ginzburg - landau model with magnetic field , the methods apply as well to the functional @xmath23 above .",
    "in particular , their results apply to the near - critical regime in _ simply connected _ domains . in our setting ,",
    "their results show that for any simply connected domain @xmath18 , the first order expansion of the critical value @xmath24 for vortex existence in minimizing configurations is also given by @xmath25 for some constant @xmath22 .",
    "moreover the locus of concentration of vortices for @xmath26 is given by the set of maxima of @xmath27 , with @xmath28 the solution of the following boundary - value problem : @xmath29 the constant @xmath22 is then determined by @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the maximum value of @xmath27 . if , for instance , @xmath32 is real - analytic and @xmath33 is nonnegative , then so is the solution @xmath28 , and the maximum is generically attained at a finite number of points in @xmath18 ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "in this situation , if @xmath26 , minimizers exhibit _ vortex concentration at isolated points _ , and the number of vortices remains uniformly bounded whenever @xmath34 is of order @xmath35 , see @xcite .",
    "the case of a multiply connected domain provides a slightly different qualitative picture . in a work on rotating bose - einstein condensates ,",
    "aftalion , alama & bronsard  @xcite considered a similar functional in a domain given by a circular annulus @xmath36 ( centered at the origin ) and again with uniform rotation @xmath37 ( see remark  [ relfunct ] ) . unlike the simply connected case , minimizers in the annulus may have vorticity without vortices , as the hole acquires positive winding at bounded rotation @xmath20",
    ". then point vortices are nucleated inside the interior of @xmath36 at a critical value @xmath24 , again of leading order @xmath38 . solving equation in the annulus @xmath36 ,",
    "one finds out that the set of maxima of the function @xmath28 is given by a circle inside @xmath36 ( see example  [ exhole ] ) .",
    "hence one can expect that , rather than accumulating at isolated points , vortices concentrate along this circle in the limit @xmath39 . the main feature proved in @xcite",
    "is that if @xmath40 , then vortices are indeed essentially supported by a circle @xmath41 and that the total degree of these vortices is of order @xmath42 .",
    "in other words , in the limit @xmath43 , infinitely many vortices concentrate on @xmath41 , a phenomenon that we call _ vortex concentration along a curve_. however the question of the distribution of the limiting vorticity around the circle was left open .",
    "subsequent results of alama & bronsard @xcite extend the result of @xcite to multiply connected domains and to the full ginzburg - landau model with magnetic field and pinning potential .",
    "in contrast with the previous case , concentration on curves might not be a generic phenomenon for the ginzburg - landau model with magnetic field in a general multiply connected domain .",
    "indeed , in this setting the vector field @xmath32 represents the electromagnetic potential and it is an unknown of the problem . the results in @xcite show that , for near - critical external applied fields , the concentration set of vortices is also given by the set of maxima of a certain potential related to @xmath32 .",
    "this set may contain finitely many points and/or closed loops .",
    "assuming that it contains closed loops , they prove that _ vortex concentration along a curve _ occurs , but the determination of the limiting vorticity was again left open .    to effectively separate the question of the nature of the concentration set from the question of localizing vortices , we instead start with a _ simply connected _",
    "domain @xmath18 , and we prescribe the function @xmath28 with @xmath44 in @xmath18 and @xmath45 , in such a way that @xmath28 is maximized on a _ prescribed curve _ @xmath46 .",
    "then , we define @xmath47 as our vector field .",
    "we will prove that vortices will be forced to accumulate on @xmath41 as @xmath0 tends to @xmath1 .",
    "the curve @xmath41 can be either a smooth jordan curve or a smooth embedded simple arc , compactly contained in @xmath18 . in this setting",
    ", we shall resolve the problem of distribution of vortices along curves , both for minimizers and in the more general setting of @xmath2-convergence . in the last section",
    "we will show that in a multiply connected domain , and for more general vector fields @xmath32 , the problem does not differ too much in nature , and that a similar analysis can be performed .    to state our main result",
    "we must give more specific hypotheses on @xmath28 and the angular speed @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that @xmath28 satisfies the following assumptions :    * [ h1 ] @xmath48 , @xmath44 in @xmath49 , and @xmath50 ; * [ sig ] @xmath51 is a jordan curve or a simple embedded arc of class @xmath52 .",
    "we further assume that @xmath53 is near to the critical value needed for the presence of vortices .",
    "more precisely , @xmath54 for some function @xmath55 satisfiying @xmath56 with @xmath57 as @xmath43 .    for @xmath58",
    "we consider the rescaled functional @xmath59 and for a nonnegative radon measure @xmath60 on @xmath61 , we define @xmath62 where the function @xmath63 denotes the dirichlet green s function of the domain @xmath61 , _",

    "[ bestn ] as a direct application of the results in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , we shall see in section 2 that for configurations @xmath82 with @xmath83-energy uniformly bounded from above , the vorticity distribution @xmath84 can be approximated ( with respect to the @xmath85topology ) by a measure of the form @xmath86 for some finite set of points @xmath87 and integers @xmath88 .",
    "in other words , each point @xmath89 can be viewed as an approximate vortex with winding number @xmath90 .",
    "thus the integer @xmath91 may be refered to as to _ approximate total vorticity _ of the configuration @xmath92 .",
    "it is commonly known that approximate vortices carry a kinetic energy essentially greater than or equal to @xmath93 ( see section  2 for more details ) .",

    "] , we deduce that if @xmath92 is energy minimizing , then @xmath99 and from theorem  [ mainthm ] , the minimal value of the energy expands as @xmath100    [ equimeas ] the value @xmath98 gives the electrostatic energy of a positive charge distribution @xmath60 on the set @xmath101 .",
    "the minimizer @xmath79 of @xmath80 over all probability measures on @xmath41 is called the _ green equilibrium measure _ in @xmath18 associated to the set @xmath41 , and gives the equilibrium charge distribution of a charged conductor inside of a neutral conducting shell , represented by @xmath102 . the value @xmath103 is refered to as to the _ capacity of the condenser _",
    "the interested reader can find in @xcite many results on the existence and general ( regularity ) properties of the equilibrium measures as well as some examples .",
    "for instance , if @xmath18 is a disc and @xmath41 is a concentric circle , then the equilibrium measure @xmath79 is the normalized arclength measure on @xmath41 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example  ii.5.13 ) , and thus vortices are asymptotically equidistributed along @xmath41 as @xmath39 .",

    "it is even singular at the endpoints , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example  ii.5.14 ) .",
    "[ diffsigma ] in the present results the structure and regularity assumptions on the set @xmath41 given in ( h2 ) are mainly motivated by the physical context of @xcite .",
    "however it will be clear that ( h2 ) can be relaxed into weaker statments .",
    "more precisely , the proof of theorem  [ mainthm ] relies on ( h2 ) only for the @xmath105 inequality , _ i.e. _ , claim _ ( iii)_. the construction of the recovery sequence ( see section  [ secupbd ] ) could be applied with minor modifications if the set @xmath41 is for instance a finite union of piecewise @xmath52 arcs / jordan curves .",
    "actually @xmath41 could even have a more general structure such as a non - empty interior . in this later case",
    "we assume that @xmath106 is made by finitely many arcs and jordan curves of class @xmath52 .",
    "then , given a nonnegative radon measure @xmath107 supported by @xmath41 , one can construct a recovery sequence for @xmath60 applying the approximation techniques of section  [ secupbd ] to @xmath108 and a more standard regularization procedure for @xmath109 as in @xcite .",
    "in section  [ annulus ] we will show how to apply the method to a multiply connected domain and a more general vector field @xmath32 .",
    "for simplicity , we shall consider only domains @xmath36 which are topological annuli , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath110 , where @xmath18 , @xmath111 are simply connected and @xmath112 . for multiply connected domains and/or a general field @xmath32 , there is an extra step involved in the analysis .",
    "indeed , the leading order term in the minimal energy ( of order @xmath113 ) is due to the curl - free part of @xmath32 which induces a diverging phase in any minimal configuration , and to the vorticity in the hole @xmath114 which acts as a sort of giant vortex ( by analogy with @xcite ) . in other words , to get information on the internal vorticity , one has to perform a second order @xmath2-convergence analysis . as in @xcite",
    "we first describe minimizing vortexless configurations ( _ i.e. _ , energy minimizers over @xmath115-valued maps ) which nonetheless have vorticity around the hole .",
    "then we show that for arbitrary configurations , the energy due to the curl - free part of @xmath32 and the hole decouples nearly exactly ( see proposition  [ energdecomp ] ) . after separating out this contribution to the energy , the residual energy functional resembles @xmath116 above , and",
    "the @xmath2-convergence analysis can be done in much the same way , with some care taken to control the residual vorticity around the hole .",
    "the result is stated in theorem  [ thmhole ] .",
    "the @xmath2-limit again involves a green energy for measures supported by a prescribed set .",
    "[ relfunct ] as mentioned earlier , the methods here may also be applied to other ginzburg - landau functionals which have the same structure as @xmath23 .",

    "serfaty considers in @xcite the minimization of this energy for rotating superfluids , with @xmath118 and under a dirichlet boundary condition @xmath119 .",
    "the minimization of the same energy under natural ( neumann ) boundary conditions also arises in a simplified model of thin - film superconductors introduced by chapman , du & gunzburger @xcite ( see also alama , bronsard & galvo - sousa @xcite ) . in this",

    "functional which resembles @xmath23 has been used in the modeling of rotating becs in certain anharmonic traps ( see @xcite ) , @xmath125 here @xmath37 is the velocity field of uniform rotation , and the function @xmath126 , positive in @xmath127 , gives the trapping potential which contains the condensate .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that @xmath128-minimizers develop as @xmath43 , infinitely many vortices concentrating along a circle for sufficently high rotation @xmath129 .",
    "we believe that similar results to the ones in section  [ annulus ] should hold , but the method is not directly applicable here .",
    "indeed , our analysis is based on  global energy estimates \" of @xcite ( see in proposition [ consvortexball ] ) and the presence of the inhomogeneity @xmath126 requires local estimates .",
    "moreover the analysis of vortices for the energy @xmath130 is complicated by the fact that @xmath126 vanishes on the boundary , and some delicate estimates are required so as not to lose too much information near the boundary .",
    "one may also consider the full ginzburg - landau model of superconductivity for complex order parameter @xmath131 and magnetic vector potential @xmath132 .",
    "for the ginzburg - landau model in a simply connected domain with constant applied magnetic field , sandier & serfaty ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 9.1 ) have proven a @xmath2-convergence theorem of the form of theorem  [ mainthm ] for applied fields of the form @xmath133 , where in that case it is appropriate to take @xmath134 this problem exhibits _ vortex concentration at points _ , and the limiting energy is obtained by rescaling around the points of concentration . the rescaled vorticity measures of minimizers converge to an equilibrium measure associated to a different problem in potential theory , a `` gauss variation '' problem whereby the charges are to be optimally placed in @xmath9 subject to an applied electric field ( see @xcite ) .",
    "concentration on curves is possible in multiply connected regions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the methods described here should apply in this situationl once adapted to the magnetic setting , although the energy obtained as a @xmath2-limit should be for the helmholtz ( and not the laplace ) green s function , @xmath135 .",
    "however , for the full ginzburg - landau functional with magnetic field in general domains , it is an interesting open problem in pde to determine which ( if any ) non - symmetric multiply connected domains exhibit vortex concentration on curves .",
    "we finally mention a recent paper by kashmar @xcite exhibiting concentration on a circle for a magnetic ginzburg - landau functional in the disc with an inhomogeneity @xmath126 as above described by a radial step function ( modelling for instance a superconducting body made by two different species ) . here",
    "again we believe that similar results should hold but the method does not directly apply due to the inhomogeneity of the ginzburg - landau energy density .",

    "<S> * abstract . * we study the variational convergence of a family of two - dimensional ginzburg - landau functionals arising in the study of superfluidity or thin - film superconductivity , as the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath0 tends to @xmath1 . in this regime and for large enough applied rotations ( for superfluids ) or magnetic fields ( for superconductors ) , </S>",
    "<S> the minimizers acquire quantized point singularities ( vortices ) . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on situations in which an unbounded number of vortices accumulate along a prescribed jordan curve or a simple arc in the domain . </S>",
    "<S> this is known to occur in a circular annulus under uniform rotation , or in a simply connected domain with an appropriately chosen rotational vector field . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that , suitably normalized , the energy functionals @xmath2-converge to a classical energy from potential theory . </S>",
    "<S> applied to global minimizers , our results describe the limiting distribution of vortices along the curve in terms of green equilibrium measures . </S>"
