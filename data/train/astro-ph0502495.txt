    "galaxy merging is thought to be the dominant process in the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this picture is broadly supported by both observations and simulations and fits naturally into the @xmath1cdm hierarchical cosmology ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "much , however , remains to be understood about the gas and stellar dynamics during mergers .",
    "for example , recent simulations indicate that not all mergers of gas - rich spiral galaxies result in a bulge - dominated remnant @xcite .",
    "although gas - rich starbursts may form many of the stars contained in elliptical galaxies , it is also likely that stars are later assembled into larger remnants via nearly dissipationless mergers , particularly during the formation of groups and clusters @xcite .",
    "there is in fact direct observational evidence for `` red '' mergers ( lacking significant star formation ) , both in local observations with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; masjedi and hogg , private communication ) and in a luminous x - ray cluster at @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the semi - analytic study of @xcite found that the most recent merger of a luminous elliptical galaxy ( @xmath3 ) is likely to have been between two bulge - dominated galaxies rather than two gas - rich spirals , again pointing to the importance of dissipationless merging for the evolution of elliptical galaxies .",
    "observationally , early type galaxies exhibit a well - defined correlation among their effective radii @xmath4 , luminosities @xmath5 ( or equivalently surface brightness @xmath6 ) , and central velocity dispersions @xmath7 .",
    "this `` fundamental plane '' @xcite is often expressed as @xmath8 and has been measured by many groups with varying results . for example , @xcite measured @xmath9 and @xmath10 from a set of 225 early - type galaxies in nearby clusters observed in the r - band .",
    "this is consistent with the original observations by @xcite and @xcite but noticeably different from the sdss determination ( based on @xmath11 early - type galaxies ) of @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite , values more similar to the k - band fundamental plane of @xcite .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is not currently clear .",
    "projections of the fundamental plane are also of interest in studies of galaxy evolution .",
    "the sdss team measured a radius - luminosity relation of @xmath14 and a faber - jackson ( 1976 ) relation of @xmath15 @xcite , while work by @xcite on the stellar mass content of sdss galaxies allowed @xcite to determine the scaling of effective radius with stellar mass : @xmath16    the fundamental plane  has typically been interpreted as a manifestation of the virial theorem , which relates @xmath7 and @xmath17 to the _ total _ enclosed ( dynamical ) mass @xmath18 and predicts a correlation in the fundamental properties of galaxies : @xmath19 giving the relation @xmath20 clearly this virial theorem expectation is incompatible with the observed fundamental plane  in equation  ( [ eqn : fp ] ) if light traces the dynamical mass ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "a systematic variation of @xmath22 with luminosity is usually assumed to `` tilt '' the virial theorem scalings into the observed ones . since @xmath23 this tilt could result from increasing @xmath24 with @xmath5 due to , for instance , varying metallicity or stellar population age , or from increasing @xmath25 with @xmath5 due to higher dark matter fraction in the central parts of more luminous galaxies .",
    "conflicting conclusions have been reported in the literature as to which of these explanations is correct ( for instance , compare @xcite with @xcite ) .",
    "structural or dynamical non - homology could also contribute to the fundamental plane  tilt ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "numerical simulations are a powerful way to assess the dynamics of galaxy mergers .",
    "there is a substantial body of work devoted to simulations of mergers of galaxies in the context of forming ellipticals ( for reviews , see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "several studies have in particular addressed the question of whether collisionless mergers of galaxies preserve the fundamental plane relations .",
    "these studies typically used simulations of @xmath26 particles ( per initial galaxy ) and have reached varying and sometimes conflicting results .",
    "for instance , @xcite studied mergers of one - component systems ( stellar bulges without dark matter haloes ) with @xmath27 and found that the merger remnants ended up very near the fundamental plane  defined by the progenitors .",
    "@xcite found that mergers of bulge - only galaxies remained on the fundamental plane , while mergers of galaxies containing both bulge and dark matter components produced a fundamental plane with a tilt larger than that observed .",
    "@xcite used repeated mergers of one- and two - component galaxies to follow the merging process over a large range in mass .",
    "they found that neither the @xmath28 nor the @xmath29 relation was preserved in their dissipationless mergers but the full fundamental plane of their merger remnants agreed with observations .    in this paper",
    "we carry out dissipationless mergers of early type galaxies , focusing on major mergers of two - component ( dark matter plus stellar bulge ) systems .",
    "we thus do not address the origin of either bulge - dominated galaxies or the fundamental plane but rather investigate whether dissipationless mergers maintain the tight fundamental plane relations , a scenario that is likely important for massive ellipticals .",
    "we pay particular attention to using cosmologically motivated models that include adiabatic contraction of dark matter haloes and merger orbits drawn from cosmological simulations .",
    "we also use a significantly larger number of simulation particles than many previous studies , which is necessary to avoid spurious two - body relaxation ( and an accompanying artificial expansion of the stellar bulge ) . in the next section ,",
    "we describe our initial models and choice of simulation parameters in more detail .",
    "section [ sec : properties ] discusses properties of both the stellar and dark matter components of the merger remnants in our simulations , including their radial density profiles , triaxiality , if and how the fundamental plane scalings and structural homology are preserved , and the changes in the mass ratio @xmath30 in the inner parts of the remnants .",
    "section [ section : discuss ] includes a discussion and summary of our results .",
    "our model galaxies consist of two components , a stellar bulge and a dark matter halo .",
    "we model the initial spatial distribution of the bulge with a @xcite density profile , @xmath31 with total stellar mass @xmath32 , quarter - mass radius @xmath33 , and half - mass radius @xmath34 .",

    "requires @xmath50 more simulation particles than a sharp truncation at the virial radius but keeps the outer part of the halo in equilibrium .",

    " simulations have shown it to be surprisingly accurate for modeling ellipticals .",
    "recent hydrodynamical simulations @xcite find that equation ( [ adiabatic ] ) overpredicts the amount of contraction at small radii but this difference is much smaller than the difference between haloes with and without adiabatic contraction , so we do not expect it to significantly affect our results .    fig .",
    "[ rhosig ] shows the initial density profiles ( top panel ) and 1-d velocity dispersions ( bottom panel ) of the stellar bulge ( symbols ) and dark matter haloes ( plain curves ) in our simulations .",
    "it also illustrates the effects of compression in the dark matter haloes ( solid vs dashed curves ) .",
    "the top panel shows that the mass density interior to @xmath53 kpc is dominated by the stellar component when the dark matter halo follows the nfw profile without compression , but compression increases the central dark matter density significantly and raises it to be larger than the stellar density at @xmath54 kpc .",
    "compression also steepens the nfw @xmath55 density cusp to nearly isothermal ( @xmath56 ) at @xmath57 kpc ( although the compressed density still asymptotes to @xmath58 at very small @xmath59 ) .",
    "the bottom panel shows that adiabatic compression increases the velocity dispersion of both the dark matter and stellar components .",
    "it is also interesting to note that regardless of compression , the mere presence of a stellar bulge in a dark matter halo increases the velocity dispersion of the dark matter component by up to a factor of @xmath60 ( for @xmath61 kpc ) in comparison with that of an nfw halo without a bulge ( dotted curve ) .",
    "this effect also greatly reduces the radius at which the `` temperature inversion '' characteristic of the nfw profile occurs .",
    "we construct the @xmath0-body models by setting the bulge and dark matter halo to be in equilibrium in the total gravitational potential .",
    "we assume that each component is both spherical and isotropic .",
    "the particle positions for each component are initialized from the density profile of that component .",
    "the particle velocities are drawn based on each component s equilibrium distribution function @xmath62 , which we calculate numerically using eddington s formula @xcite : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the density profile of component @xmath65 while @xmath66 is the _ total _ gravitational potential .",
    "( this is to be contrasted with the typical one - component model , where @xmath67 and @xmath66 are related by poisson s equation . )",
    "this method of selecting the velocities is self - consistent and makes no assumptions about the local form of the velocity distribution , allowing us to create stable initial conditions ( see @xcite for a full discussion of sampling velocities when constructing initial conditions for n - body models ) .",
    "note that while the _ positions _ of the particles in each component are the same as would be given in a one - component model , the _ velocities _ are not due to the presence of the other component .",
    "( top ) and 1-d velocity dispersion profiles @xmath68 ( bottom ) of the stellar bulge ( symbols ) and dark matter halo ( plain curves ) used in our simulations .",
    "the dark matter and bulge masses are set to be @xmath69 and @xmath70 here . an adiabatically compressed dark matter halo ( solid ) has a larger @xmath67 and @xmath7 than the standard nfw halo ( dashed ) in the inner tens of kpc .",
    "the velocity profile of a standard bulge - less nfw halo of the same mass is plotted ( dotted curve ) for comparison .",

    "table [ table - ics ] summarizes the parameters used in the galaxy models and simulations for our series of production and test runs . before adiabatic compression ,",
    "the initial haloes in our simulations have @xmath71 and concentration @xmath72 , giving a scale radius of @xmath73 kpc and virial radius of @xmath74 kpc .",
    "gravity is the only physics in our simulation , meaning we can in principle interpret the results at different mass scales by a corresponding scaling of time and length . in practice , however , the presence of a stellar bulge complicates this scaling ( see section [ section : discuss ] for details ) .",
    "we consider two values for the total dark matter to stellar mass ratios , @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) and @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) , which are chosen to be representative of the values estimated from sdss @xcite and weak lensing @xcite .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : properties ] , we do not find the merger remnants to depend sensitively on this ratio .",
    "we relate the remaining free parameter of the hernquist density profile  the length scale @xmath79  to the stellar mass using the observed @xmath80 relation of early - type galaxies in sdss @xcite rather than @xmath81 ( s. shen , private communication ) ] : @xmath82 our choices of @xmath83 and @xmath4 do not guarantee that the velocity dispersion @xmath84 of a model bulge will lie on the observed fundamental plane .",
    "in fact , observations of the fundamental plane  measure the faber - jackson @xmath85 relation while our simulations use the @xmath29 relation .",
    "we relate the two using the @xmath86 band values from sdss @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath87 in the @xmath86 band , consistent with the estimates of kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , we find that a bulge of @xmath88 should have a characteristic velocity dispersion of @xmath89 km / s .",
    "table  [ table - ics ] shows that this is reasonably consistent with the values we obtain from model m20 ( which includes adiabatic contraction ) and is noticeably higher than the uncompressed halo model ( m20u ) . in order to lie on the @xmath29 relation ,",
    "the uncompressed model must have a very large value of @xmath90 .",
    "adiabatic contraction ( and the associated increase in the dark matter fraction at small radii ) therefore helps put the initial galaxy models closer to the observed fundamental plane  ( see , however , @xcite for an alternate view ) .",
    "in addition to the internal structure of the bulge and dark matter halo , the orbit of a binary encounter is also important in determining the properties of the merger remnants .",
    "for instance , it is well - known that radial orbits tend to result in prolate remnants whereas orbits with significant angular momentum generally give oblate or triaxial end - products ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "most merger studies to date have assumed parabolic orbits with somewhat ad hoc impact parameters .",
    "we attempt to use more realistic orbits by drawing from recent results on the orbital distribution of merging dark matter haloes in cosmological n - body simulations .",
    "@xcite , for example , has analyzed the orbital parameters of minor mergers in the virgo consortium s n - body simulations of a @xmath1cdm model .",
    "he finds that the orbital distribution peaks at semi - major axis @xmath91 and eccentricity @xmath92 slightly less than 1 .",
    "@xcite studied similar quantities in major mergers ( with mass ratio within 4:1 ) and found that the distribution of circularities peaks at @xmath93 , consistent with the findings of benson , an earlier study by @xcite , and recent results from @xcite .",

    "we assign the radial and tangential velocities @xmath97 and @xmath98 of this orbit to agree with benson s analysis ( his figs .  2 & 7 , and equation",

    "the same is true for run n20 , which is identical to m20 aside from having lower orbital velocity .",
    "the radial merger ( run r20 ) , however , breaks homology significantly more than the `` most probable '' orbit . in all five production runs , the ratio of bulge - dark matter to bulge - bulge potential energy increases , reflecting the relative distribution of dark matter and stars , a point which we discuss further in section [ section : dmfraction ] .",

    "because our simulations involve only gravitational interactions , the results can be interpreted at different mass and length scales by an appropriate rescaling of time .",
