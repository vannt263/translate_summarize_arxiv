    "there has been a great deal of interest in the physics of heavy hadrons containing one heavy quark .",
    "the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) allows one to study the properties of the heavy hadrons in a systematic @xmath0-expansion .",
    "the leading term of the expansion gives rise to the spin - flavour symmetry of heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) .",
    "the corrections to the leading hqs results are determined by the small expansion parameter @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the scale of low energy physics ( for a review of hqet see  @xcite , for a review of hqs and the sum rule approach for heavy mesons see  @xcite ) .    among the well - known predictions of hqs",
    "are e.g.  the relations between different heavy hadron transition form factors .",
    "take for example , the @xmath15 electro - weak transitions .",
    "the six form - factors describing this transition are reduced to one universal isgur - wise function in the hqs limit  @xcite .",
    "even then one still remains with many non - perturbative parameters characterizing the process and the heavy baryons participating in it .",
    "these concern the functional behaviour of the isgur - wise function itself , the masses and residues of the heavy baryons , and , at next - to - leading order in the heavy mass expansion , the average kinetic and chromomagnetic energy of the heavy quark in the heavy baryon .",
    "all these non - perturbative parameters can be determined by using non - perturbative methods as e.g.  lattice calculations , qcd sum rule methods  @xcite or , in a less fundamental approach , by using potential models .    in the present paper",
    "we study the correlator of two heavy baryon currents in the hqs limit when @xmath16 . using the qcd sum rule method",
    "we calculate the masses and residues of the heavy baryons associated with the heavy baryon currents . in its original form the qcd sum rule method was suggested by shifman et al .",
    "@xcite as a tool to investigate the properties of light meson systems . later on the method was extended to the case of light baryons in  @xcite . the qcd sum rule approach has proven itself to be a very powerful non - perturbative qcd - based tool which takes into account the properties of the qcd vacuum .",
    "it allows one to obtain reliable estimates for hadron masses , their residues and their elastic as well as their transition form factors .    in the heavy - light sector the first leading order analysis ( leading both in @xmath0 as well as in @xmath1 ) of heavy meson properties within the qcd sum rule approach was performed in  @xcite .",
    "later on the heavy meson sum rule calculation was extended to include next - to - leading order radiative corrections .",
    "the next - to - leading order corrections proved to be rather important  @xcite .",
    "qcd sum rules for baryons with large but finite masses @xmath8 were first studied in  @xcite . later on the methods of hqet",
    "were incorporated in the sum rule analysis .",
    "the leading order qcd sum rules for heavy baryons were first considered in  @xcite , again to leading order both in @xmath0 as well as in @xmath1 .",
    "finite mass corrections to these sum rules were discussed in  @xcite .    in order to improve on the accuracy of the existing qcd sum rule analysis of heavy baryons one needs to avail of the next - to - leading order radiative corrections to the sum rules .",
    "this forms the subject of the present paper .",
    "we calculate the qcd radiative corrections to the leading perturbative term in the operator product expansion ( ope ) and , from these , we derive next - to - leading order qcd sum rules for heavy baryons in the hqs limit .",
    "we then go on to analyze the sum rules and compute the values of the masses and the residues of the heavy baryons at next - to - leading order accuracy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we introduce heavy baryon currents as interpolating fields for the heavy ground state baryons . in sec .",
    "3 we construct the correlator of two heavy baryon currents by means of the ope and define the spectral density . in sec .",
    "4 we present our results on the radiative corrections to the perturbative part of the spectral density and construct renormalization group invariant qcd sum rules by recapitulating some known results on the one- and two - loop anomalous dimensions of the currents .",
    "sec .  5 contains the results of our numerical analysis .",
    "6 , finally , contains our summary and our conclusions . in appendix",
    "a we provide a detailed collection of results on the calculation of the two- and three - loop contributions to the correlator of two heavy baryon currents .",

    "we have considered the operator product expansion of the correlator of two static heavy baryon currents at small euclidian distances and determined the @xmath1 radiative corrections to the first wilson coefficient in the expansion .",
    "based on this expansion we formulated and analyzed heavy baryon sum rules for the @xmath62-type and @xmath63-type heavy baryons using two different types of interpolating fields for the baryons in each case .",
    "we have discussed in some detail the scale independence of the @xmath1 sum rules which requires the consideration of the anomalous dimensions of the heavy baryon currents at the two - loop level .",
    "similar to the case of heavy mesons the qcd radiative correction to the first term in the ope is quite large and amounts to a @xmath5 change in the perturbative contribution .",
    "the radiative correction to the perturbative term increase the calculated sum rule values for the baryon masses by about @xmath64 and the residues by about @xmath6 relative to the corresponding lowest order values .",
    "the sum rule results do not depend very much on which of the two possible interpolating fields is used in each case .",
    "the sum rule analysis is , however , quite sensitive to changes in the assumed threshold energy of the continuum .",
    "this sensitivity is the main source of uncertainty in our results and is partly due to the use of diagonal correlators .",
    "qcd sum rules based on the diagonal correlators feature a leading order spectral density which grows rapidly as @xmath65 .",
    "this rapid growth introduces a strong dependence of the sum rule results on the assumed energy of continuum .",
    "second , the qcd radiative correction to the leading order spectral density is about @xmath5 at the renormalization scale @xmath66 . we may try to make the coefficient at @xmath1 in these corrections to be moderate considering the very low renormalization scale @xmath67 .",
    "we have not considered non - diagonal sum rules which come in when one considers correlators between two different currents with the same quantum numbers .",
    "these non - diagonal sum rules bring in some new features such as a more `` normal '' behaviour of the spectral density @xmath68 and thus probably more moderate qcd corrections to this spectral density . on the other hand ,",
    "the leading term for non - diagonal sum rules is proportional to the quark condensate , whose value @xmath69 is known only with an accuracy of 10% , which gives an additional uncertainty in the result for non - diagonal sum rules .",
    "the analysis of the non - diagonal sum rules will form the subject of a subsequent paper .",
