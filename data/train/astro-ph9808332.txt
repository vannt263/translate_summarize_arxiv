    "the primary purpose of the all - sky monitor on the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ is to alert the astrophysics community in a timely manner to the outbursts of transient x - ray sources and to changes of state of persistent sources .",
    "another purpose , which some may be consider to be a byproduct , is to record long - term x - ray `` light curves '' for the detected sources . here",
    "i review the results of a year and a half of operation of the asm , with selected illustrative examples of light curves and other results .",
    "first , the instrument design , operation , and data analysis is briefly described to provide background useful in interpreting the results .",
    "the numbers and types of transient sources that have been detected so far by the asm are then discussed .",
    "a selection of astrophysical investigations that may be supported by the asm results is described .",
    "finally , i give advice and encouragement on the use of asm data and results .",
    "the asm consists of three scanning shadow cameras ( sscs ) mounted on a motorized rotation drive .",
    "each ssc contains a position - sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) that views the sky through a slit mask .",
    "the pspc is used to measure the displacements and strengths of the shadow patterns cast by x - ray sources within the field of view , and to thereby infer the directions and intensities of the sources .",
    "each ssc is sensitive in the energy range of approximately 1.512 kev , with on - axis effective areas of @xmath010 @xmath1 , @xmath030 @xmath1 , and @xmath023 @xmath1 at 2 , 5 , and 10 kev , respectively , and with a @xmath2 ( fwhm ) field of view .",
    "the asm is operated so as to obtain series of 90s exposures , called `` dwells '' , during which the orientations of the sscs remain fixed .",
    "the drive assembly rotates the structure holding the 3 sscs by @xmath3 between dwells so that large portions of the sky are eventually scanned during each orbit of the spacecraft .",
    "the sensitivity is typically @xmath030 mcrab ( @xmath4 ) for a source in the central region of the field of view of an ssc for a 90s exposure .",
    "any given source is typically scanned 5 to 15 times over the course of a day , so that the sensitivity is of order @xmath010 mcrab on a daily basis .",
    "a more extensive description of the instrument , operations , and data analysis may be found in levine et al .",
    "when the asm first became operational , two sources were in outburst and were bright enough to be easily detectable .",
    "these outbursts were associated with the sources gro j174428 and x160852 ( see figure  [ fig : romefig1 ] ) .",
    "the asm has since detected the outbursts of quite a few other sources .",
    "while the majority of these sources were previously known or were discovered by other means , three of these transient sources were newly discovered with the pca , and two were newly discovered using the asm .",
    "this small number of new transient sources was a surprise .",
    "since the asm is significantly more sensitive than previous x - ray monitors , we anticipated that more previously unknown sources would be found .",
    "the sources that have been discovered with the pca include xte j1856 + 053 , xte j1842042 , and xte j1739302 , while xte j1716389 and xte j1755324 were discovered with the asm .",
    "the light curves of 6 selected sources which have been detected in outburst for limited periods of time are shown in figure  [ fig : romefig1 ] .",
    "as noted above , the bursting pulsar gro j174428 and the lmxb x160852 were already in outburst at the beginning of the _ rxte _ mission .",
    "the middle two light curves are of sources discovered with _ rxte _ ; one can see that xte j1856 + 053 underwent two distinct weak outbursts , while only one outburst of xte j1755324 has been observed .",
    "the spectrum of xte j1755324 was very soft near the peak of its outburst , and in fact was softer than any other source in the galactic center region that can be detected with the asm .",
    "its spectrum hardened considerably as its intensity decayed .",
    "the light curve of the rapid burster ( x1730333 ) shows recurrent outbursts which are spaced by @xmath0200 and @xmath0240 days .",
    "this confirms earlier indications that the source tends to go into outburst about every six months @xcite , and indicates that the outbursts most likely occur quasiperiodically .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : romefig1 ] shows the outburst behavior of aql x-1 in the _ rxte _ era .",
    "in addition to the two obvious outbursts , it appears that the asm just caught the tail end of an outburst as it first became operational , and detected a `` failed outburst '' starting around mjd 50240 .",
    "a number of systems show outbursts which appear according to an underlying periodicity . for systems such as gx3012 , exo2030 + 375 , and gro j2058 + 42 ,",
    "the outbursts are consistently detected , whereas in systems like 4u1145619 and 4u0115 + 63 only a few outbursts have been detected . in the latter two sources ,",
    "the outbursts are spaced at 187 d and 24 d , respectively .",
    "i should note that in gro j2058 + 42 the outbursts occur every @xmath055 d , while a spacing of @xmath0110 d is apparent in the light curve derived from observations with batse  @xcite .",
    "the light curves of 4u1145619 and gro j2058 + 42 may be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : romefig2 ] .",
    "some sources , such as grs1915 + 105 and gro j165544 , have undergone relatively long - lived outbursts .",
    "other sources , such as ks1731260 and xte j1716389 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : romefig2 ] ) , would not be classified as transients on the basis of _ rxte _ data alone , since their emission has persisted for the entire mission so far , but are nonetheless classified as transients since they were not detected in observations with other instruments on occasions prior to the launch of _",
    "we further illustrate the muddiness of the distinction between transient and persistent sources with the light curves of cen x-3 and cyg x-3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : romefig2 ] ) .",
    "one can see the large and unpredictable variation of the intensities of these two sources , which is not at all unprecedented among the so - called `` persistent '' sources .",
    "persistent sources also show state changes , with the hard / soft transitions of cyg x-1 being the archetype  @xcite .",
    "the asm has also detected x - ray emission during gamma - ray bursts and provided data for burst localization .",
    "early estimates of the numbers of gamma - ray bursts were low becuse of a lack of data on the x - ray intensity of bursts and because the long duration , often over 100 s , of bursts in the 212 kev band was not taken into account .",
    "since the asm typically rotates by @xmath3 every 90 s , the effective sky coverage for events that last @xmath0100 s is of order twice as large as for events which last a small fraction of 90 s. indeed , this factor made it possible for the asm to obtain crossed lines of position from the 1997 august 15 and 1997 august 28 gamma - ray bursts .",
    "in addition to alerting observers to interesting cosmic x - ray phenomena , the asm light curves may be directly of use in astrophysical investigations .",
    "one of the most obvious of these is a search for periodic variability that could reveal the orbital period of a system or some other interesting phenomenon .",
    "another type of investigation is the comparative study of the variability of different sources . in this section ,",
    "i suggest a few lines of investigation that are likely to be interesting .",
    "we and others have searched for periodic signals in the the asm x - ray light curves with the use of ffts and/or lomb - scargle transforms .",
    "figure  [ fig : asmpds ] shows examples of power density spectra constructed using ffts .",
    "significant signals are detected in the spectra of each of the four power density spectra . in the cases of x1624490 , am her , and lmc x-4 , the periodicities were known prior to the _ rxte _ era .",
    "the detection of the 3.09 h periodicity of am her was unexpected , in that the source is so weak ( @xmath01 mcrab ) that it is not detectable from direct inspection of the light curve itself . in the case of sco x-1 , two peaks at periods near 37 days ,",
    "stand out ( also see  @xcite ) .",
    "table [ tab : asmpers ] includes a list of periodicities that have either been detected in our analyses of asm data or have been reported in the literature based on asm data .",
    "most of these are unquestionably detected in the power density spectra that we have computed ; a few appear , in our analyses , to be based on peaks of marginal significance when the generally high noise level at low frequencies is taken into account .",
    "the 2.6 d periodicity in gro j165540 was reported by kuulkers et al .",
    "@xcite not on the basis of a feature in a power density spectrum , but on the basis of the detection of `` dips '' that occur at about the same orbital phase .",

    "rotation &    the quasiperiodic intensity variations seen in systems like her x-1 and lmc x-4 are most likely caused by a tilted precessing accretion disk .",
    "the asm light curve of smc x-1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : romefig3 ] ) strongly suggests that such a disk is present in this system , and this is confirmed by observations with other instruments  @xcite .",
    "quasiperiodic variations , on time scales much longer than the orbital periods , have also been seen in other systems , such as cyg x-2 , lmc x-3 , and 4u170544 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : romefig3 ] ) .",
    "it is natural to raise the question of whether the quasiperiodic variability in these sources is also caused by tilted ( or warped ) precessing accretion disks .",
    "this question can be extended to asking whether the apparently random variability of 4u1728 - 34 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , or the variability of 4u1820 - 30 , which seems to have a periodicity near p = 175 d ( smale & lochner  @xcite ) as well as random variability that is similar to that of 4u1728 - 34 , may also be caused by the same effect .",
    "one can speculate that disk tilt , warp , and/or precession may be evident as variability that can range from being rather periodic to being quite chaotic depending on the details of the accretion rate and disk structure .",
    "the light curves of the z - type lmxb s show definite similarities to each other . in particular , the light curves of the three z sources sco x-1 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : romefig3 ] ) , gx17 + 2 , and gx349 + 2 , show flares on top of a relatively constant baseline .",
    "the z sources gx51 and gx340 + 0 yield light curves which are better described by random variability within a limited intensity range rather than by a baseline with distinct flares",
    ". finally , cyg x-2 shows dips from a baseline that wanders in a quasiperiodic manner over a range of a factor of 3 or more in strength . from figure",
    "[ fig : romefig3 ] , one can see that the light curve of sco x-1 bears no resemblance at all to that of atoll sources like 4u172834 .",
    "another result that begs for explanation is the large degree of variation of the profiles and durations of the outbursts of transient sources .",
    "the outbursts of 4u163047 , grs1915 + 105 , gro j165540 , and grs1739278 are each quite different from any of the outbursts shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : romefig1 ] .",
    "i can also mention that the light curves and periodic spectral variation of cir x-1 must be telling us something of astrophysical importance , and dramatic spectral variations of cyg x-1 likewise .",
    "observers and students of bright x - ray sources will find asm data and results to be useful .",
    "the light curves can indicate good observing opportunities , and later , when interpretation is in order , can give context to `` snapshot '' observations .",
    "one can keep informed using the mit and gsfc web pages ( http://space.mit.edu/xte and http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/xte.html ) which have notes on source activities as well as the light curves .",
    "detailed analyses of a number of the brighter sources will be interesting ; the data are available to be downloaded and analyzed .",
    "these data include the individual intensity measurements from the 90 s dwells in each of three energy bands .",
    "while i strongly encourage the use of asm data , i should caution potential users to beware of the occasional individual measurement that is affected by a problem .",
    "patterns in the results are often much more reliable than a single high or low measurement .",
    "finally , our error estimates do not include contributions representing all systematic effects .",
    "the errors are undoubtedly underestimated for sources observed with other sources also present in the field of view .",
    "the systematic effects will be particularly obvious in long - term averages of measurements of weak sources .",
    "i would also encourage potential users to contact a member of the asm team with any questions that may arise .",
