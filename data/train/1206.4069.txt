    "differential equations are extensively used in modeling dynamical systems in science and engineering . when dynamical systems are under random influences , stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) may be more appropriate for modeling .",
    "the solutions of sdes are interpreted in terms of stochastic integrals @xcite .",
    "dynamical systems subject to gaussian white noise are often modeled by sdes with brownian motion , and the solutions are in terms of the ito integral @xcite .",
    "although the ito integral is self - consistent mathematically , it is not the only type of stochastic integrals that can be constructed to interpret an sde .",
    "other stochastic integrals , such as the stratonovich integral @xcite , have also been used to interpret an sde as a stochastic integral equation .",
    "there is no right or wrong choice when choosing either ito or stratonovich integrals in interpreting sdes mathematically , since the two integrals are equivalent and can be converted into each other , provided that the integrand satisfies certain smoothness conditions @xcite .",
    "however , these stochastic integrals have different definitions , and one may be more directly related to a practical situation than the other .",
    "while ito integral is a reasonable choice in many applications including finance and biology @xcite , stratonovich integral is believed to be more appropriate in physical and engineering applications @xcite .",
    "stratonovich integral has an extra term comparing with the corresponding ito integral : the so - called correction term @xcite .",
    "some authors @xcite attribute this correction term to the conversion from physical white noise to ideal white noise .",
    "this explanation is not necessarily convincing @xcite .",
    "dynamical systems driven by non - gaussian white noise , especially poisson white noise , have attracted a lot of attention recently .",
    "correction terms for converting ito sdes to stratonovich sdes with poisson white noise are presented in @xcite .",
    "although these correction terms have been accepted widely , there are some confusions @xcite .    in this paper , we consider nonlinear random vibration under excitations of either gaussian or poisson white noises , modeled by appropriate stochastic differential equations .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to explain the correction terms in both gaussian and poisson white noise cases , from a physical perspective .",
    "we will show that the correction terms are natural consequences of fundamental physical laws satisfied by the vibration system .",
    "note that conventional spectral analysis methods @xcite , which have found extensive applications in random vibration analysis , are not applicable in this case due to the nonlinearity of the system .    to this end",

    "( [ section1_tmp1 ] ) and ( [ solutionstobe ] ) are yet to be defined .",
    "as stated earlier , the stochastic integrals which can be used to interpreted sdes may not be unique .",
    "the question is that which stochastic integral will lead to the solution that is consistent with the physics of the system .",
    "one possible answer is to compare solutions to the sdes with the corresponding experimental results .",
    "however , this method may be impractical in many cases due to the high cost of performing the experiments , as one needs highly accurate data from sufficiently large number of samples in order to resolve the subtle difference in the theory .",
