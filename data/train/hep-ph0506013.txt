    "cp violation is one of the key ingredients required for baryogenesis @xcite . in most particle - physics models ,",

    "cp violation is built in via complex phases in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite , albeit with a very small amplitude .",
    "since sm cp violation is very small , it is not possible to obtain a sufficiently large net baryon to entropy ratio in this scenario .",
    "hence , in extensions of the sm additional cp violation is often introduced via cp - violating phases in an extended higgs sector to explain lepto / baryogenesis .    following earlier ideas of dolgov @xcite , we recently proposed an alternative dynamical mechanism of cp violation in the early universe @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . here",
    "we elaborate on this mechanism . in this scenario ,",
    "the lagrangian is cp symmetric .",
    "however , there are complex phases which arise as initial conditions for scalar fields in the early universe . in the framework of inflationary cosmology it is possible that these phases are coherent over the present hubble patch , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "these complex phases lead to cp violation .",
    "the magnitude of cp violation decreases as the scalar fields relax to their ground state .",
    "thus , in the framework of dynamical cosmological cp violation , large cp violation in the early universe leading to the observed baryon to entropy ratio is no longer in conflict with the small magnitude of the presently measured cp violation in the laboratory .    in @xcite",
    ", we discussed the general framework of dynamical cosmological cp violation in the case of a model with two complex scalar fields .",
    "we showed explicitly how the dynamics of the background scalar fields ( the `` condensates '' ) can lead to the generation of a cp asymmetry in the scalar field quanta which are generated via the decay of the condensates .",
    "we briefly mentioned how this cp asymmetry in the scalar sector can be transformed into a cp asymmetry of the fermions leading eventually to baryogenesis . in this paper",
    "we elaborate on these two issues .",
    "moreover we point out a second channel to produce cp violation in the fermionic sector directly from the dynamics of background scalar fields .",
    "we observe that non - trivial phases of the evolution of the condensate can induce complex yukawa terms in the lagrangian .",
    "this results in what we call the ` transient maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pontecorvo ) mns(p ) matrix' @xcite , and leads to cp violation in the leptonic sector .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we review the basic ideas of dynamical cosmological cp violation as discussed in @xcite and give a brief overview of the ways in which this can result in lepto / baryogenesis . in section 3",
    "we study the avenues for leptogenesis which make use of an asymmetry in scalar field quanta generated by the evolving background condensate . in section 4",
    "we study leptogenesis channels in which the background condensate directly induces the lepton asymmetry via the transient mns(p ) matrix . in section 5",
    ", we consider a specific leptogenesis channel and evaluate how the resulting lepton asymmetry depends on the parameters and initial conditions of our model . in section 6 ,",
    "we comment on other possibilities of realizing leptogenesis using complex initial conditions .",
    "we conclude in section 7 with a summary of the main results and a discussion of future directions of research .",
    "in this section , we review the scenario of @xcite in which nontrivial phases in the initial conditions of scalar fields lead to dynamical cp violation in a theory in which the lagrangian is symmetric under cp .",
    "we then explain how this dynamical cp violation can be transferred to fermions , leading to a lepton - anti - lepton asymmetry , and eventually to a baryon - antibaryon asymmetry .     * phases from initial conditions : * consider a toy model containing the two complex doublet scalar fields @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( we take doublets instead of singlets only to make the field content of the model look more like that of the standard model ) . for the moment , we say nothing about the quantum numbers of these two fields , except that they are the same for both @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "the scalar potential of the model is taken to be v(_1,_2 ) = _",
    "i=1,2 m_i^2 _",
    "i^_i + v_4(_1 , _ 2 )  , [ pot ] where it is assumed that @xmath4 , and v_4(_1,_2 ) = g ( _ 2^_1 ) ( _ 2^_2 ) + h.c .",
    ", [ pot2 ] where @xmath5 is a real coupling constant .",
    "it is natural to assume that only the neutral components of @xmath2 pick up an initial non - vanishing expectation value . from now on the @xmath2 s will denote the neutral components of the respective doublets .",
    "note that their potential will look exactly the same as eqs .",
    "( [ pot ] ) and ( [ pot2 ] ) , with the hermitian conjugates replaced by complex conjugates of the neutral components .    in the context of hot big bang or inflationary cosmology , it is natural to assume that the neutral scalar fields will start out displaced from their vacuum values . in a non - inflationary universe , the spatial gradients of these fields would be large and they would rapidly relax to their ground - state values .",
    "however , in the context of inflationary cosmology the situation is very different .",
    "if the mass of the neutral scalar fields is smaller than the hubble constant during inflation , the fields will evolve essentially as free scalar fields .",
    "that is , they will respond to quantum fluctuations like a free scalar field , and thus acquire a large root mean square expectation value when averaged over a region of radius @xmath6 ( a `` hubble patch '' ) . at the end of inflation , these neutral scalar fields will thus in general be displaced from the minimum of the bare potential energy function by an amount which is large compared to @xmath7 ( see e.g.  @xcite and @xcite for a review ) .",
    "after inflation ends , the hubble constant will gradually decrease , eventually falling below the mass scale of the scalar fields . at this point",
    ", these scalar fields will begin to roll towards their ground state .",
    "it is this dynamics in the post - inflationary universe which will lead to dynamical cp violation and resulting leptogenesis . to see this ,",
    "observe that although one of the two phases of the two neutral complex scalar fields can in general be eliminated by a phase redefinition , the second can not . if we choose the initial value of @xmath1 to be real ( and denoted by @xmath8 ) , but take the initial value of @xmath0 to have a phase @xmath9 , i.e.  to be @xmath10 , then in order to analyze the particle - physics processes one needs to consider fluctuations of the scalar fields around this complex initial condition ( background ) .",
    "this effectively introduces non - trivial complex phases in the scalar potential as well as in the yukawa interactions with the fermions , leading to cp violation . in this paper",
    "we examine ways in which such cp violation can be transferred to the fermion sector , concentrating principally on leptogenesis scenarios     * baryogenesis preceded by leptogenesis : * in order to produce a baryon - antibaryon asymmetry we first of all need processes which violate baryon number .",
    "secondly , we require c and cp violation @xcite ( for recent reviews on baryogenesis , we refer the reader to @xcite ) . in most baryogenesis scenarios ,",
    "the required cp violation is explicitly introduced into the lagrangian . however , as discussed earlier , in our approach this is not the case .",
    "rather , it is the initial conditions which generate this asymmetry .",
    "this dynamical mechanism of cp violation can be coupled to many of the well - known models of baryogenesis . however , in light of current data which points to a nonzero neutrino mass @xcite , one of the preferred mechanisms for generating the baryon asymmetry involves first generating a lepton asymmetry .",
    "this asymmetry then can be converted to a baryon - antibaryon asymmetry via baryon - number - violating sphaleron processes @xcite .",
    "as we emphasize below , this mechanism does not require any new baryon or lepton - number - violating terms in the lagrangian .",
    "in the following , we shall focus on this possibility .",
    "( note that , in this paper , we do not discuss the possibility of baryogenesis via quarks alone .",
    "however , it is straightforward to modify our scenarios to include cp violation in the quark sector directly . )",
    "note that it is not necessary to have more leptons than anti - leptons in order for the sphalerons to produce more baryons than anti - baryons .",
    "in fact , an asymmetry in only certain states is sufficient .",
    "this observation comes about because the weak interactions  and hence the sphaleron interactions ",
    "couple to only left - handed particles and right - handed anti - particles . since only these states",
    "are involved , the production of @xmath11 or @xmath12 can not lead to a baryon - antibaryon asymmetry . while it is true that a @xmath13 state can be converted into a @xmath14 state ,",
    "the rate is proportional to the mass of the @xmath15 . for light neutrinos ,",
    "this conversion rate is sufficiently slow that an asymmetry between @xmath16 and @xmath17 survives to the weak scale .",
    "thus , sphalerons can convert an asymmetry between @xmath16 and @xmath17 alone into a baryon asymmetry .    on the other hand",
    ", this does not hold for electrons since any generated asymmetry is washed out by the mass terms @xcite .",
    "thus , an asymmetry between @xmath18 and @xmath19 can not be converted into a baryon - antibaryon asymmetry via the standard electroweak sphaleron effects .",
    "the upshot of this discussion is that we can successfully obtain baryogenesis involving sphalerons provided it is preceded by one of two scenarios .",
    "either ( i ) we have full leptogenesis , i.e.  there is an asymmetry between lepton and anti - lepton number , or ( ii ) an asymmetry between @xmath16 and @xmath17 is created .",
    "the former case naturally suggests that there are more leptons than anti - leptons .. in this case of course one requires the presence of lepton - number - violating processes , as is required in thermal leptogenesis scenarios @xcite , for example .",
    "the latter scenario is in spirit similar to dirac leptogenesis @xcite , but it differs in two aspects .",
    "first , there need not be explicit lepton - number violation , and second , apriori the lagrangian is cp conserving .    in the following sections we discuss two distinct mechanisms for generating a lepton asymmetry .",
    "the first involves cp - violating scalar interactions which generate an asymmetry between scalar particles and their anti - particles .",
    "this cp asymmetry is then transferred to the lepton sector .",
    "the second uses what we call the `` transient mns(p ) matrix . ''",
    "note that , for either mechanism to work , one needs yukawa interactions between the rolling scalar fields and the sm fermions .",
    "however , the specific applications of these interactions depend on the mechanism , and are slightly different .",
    "* cp violation in the scalar sector : * we begin by considering mechanisms by which a cp asymmetry involving scalars can be transferred to the lepton sector . as discussed in @xcite ( and making use of the phase conventions discussed in section 2 ) we consider field fluctuations about the initial conditions : _2 = _ 2 - a_2  ,   _1 = _ 1 - a_1 e^i  .",
    "[ initc ] note that in the context of cosmologically evolving fields , the background fields @xmath20 vary with time .",
    "we shall address the dynamical evolution later ( in section 5 ) .",
    "for now , we mention that , in order for the cp - violating effects at different times to add up coherently , we work in the adiabatic approximation where we assume that the time - dependence of the background fields is slow compared to the interaction time scale of the fluctuations .",
    "we will focus on the time - dependence of the amplitude of the fields .",
    "however , in principle , the phase @xmath9 can also be time dependent @xcite .    the relations ( [ initc ] ) can be inverted and inserted into the scalar potential of ( [ pot ] ) . expanding the quartic term of ( [ pot2 ] ) , one finds both quadratic and cubic terms .",
    "dropping the primes , the cubic interaction terms become v_3 = g + h.c .",
    "[ cubic2 ] the induced couplings contribute to the decay @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this decay is cp - violating , as can be seen as follows .",

    "because these diagrams have relative weak and strong phases , one finds that the number of @xmath1 states is unequal to the number of @xmath22 states . basis .",

    "this is cp violation in the scalar sector . specifically , the relative asymmetry @xmath23 in the decay rates is a_cp ~2  .",
    "[ sacp ]    this asymmetry in the scalar sector must now be transferred to the leptonic sector .",
    "this happens through the yukawa interactions . as discussed , earlier , there are two possibilities .",

    "we refer to these as scenarios a and b , respectively .     * transferring asymmetry to fermions : * we begin with mechanism a and briefly discuss the generation of a cp asymmetry in the leptonic sector via the decay of scalar quanta . in this case one",

    "these initial conditions effectively lead to complex ( non - diagonal ) yukawa couplings , which again lead to mass matrices whose diagonalization includes cp - violating phases .",
    "however , in contrast to the sm , once the fields relax to their minima , the contributions to the masses are switched off , and the cp - violating mixing matrix vanishes .",

    ", the net baryon to entropy ratio is given by @xcite [ final1 ] n_b s ~ y_^2 y _ ( ) ( t_e ) , where @xmath83 is the typical value of a neutrino yukawa coupling constant from ( [ yukawa ] ) , @xmath84 is the cp asymmetry per decay from ( [ dcpyuk ] ) , @xmath85 is the number density of photons , @xmath86 denotes the entropy density , and @xmath87 the net baryon number density . a way to understand the above equation is as follows : @xmath88 is the cp asymmetry in the decay rate of @xmath35 quanta , @xmath89 is the rate of change in the number of @xmath35 quanta at time @xmath79 , the time when most of the net baryon number density is generated , and @xmath90 gives the time interval during which leptogenesis is effective and must be multiplied with the rate of generation of the baryon asymmetry to obtain the final baryon to entropy ratio .    in turn , the asymmetry factor @xmath84 in the above equation ( [ final1 ] ) is given by combining ( [ dcpyuk ] ) and ( [ ckmph ] ) and inserting the time evolution of the function @xmath71 .",
    "however , given the gauge symmetry of our model , the masses of both scalar fields @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the same and they will thus begin rolling at the same time with vanishing velocity . hence , @xmath71 will be constant in time .",
    "since we are also taking the phase @xmath9 to be constant , the phase @xmath54 and hence @xmath84 are independent of time .    to evaluate the order of magnitude of the result ( [ final1 ] ) , we must estimate the value of @xmath91 .",
    "from the equation of motion ( [ eom1 ] ) it follows that ( t_e ) ~ m _ ( t_e ) and hence [ final2 ] n_b s ~ y_^2 y _ m _ ^2(t_e ) . since the time @xmath79 is given by the saturation of ( [ constraint1 ] ) ,",
    "the photon number density is given by n_(t_e ) ~ m_^3/2 m_pl^3/2 , where @xmath92 is the planck mass , and we have used the friedmann equations to relate the temperature of the radiation bath ( whose cube yields @xmath85 ) to the hubble expansion rate at time @xmath79 which in turn is equal to @xmath76 .",
    "thus , ( [ final2 ] ) becomes [ final3 ] n_b s ~ y_^2 y _ ^2(t_e ) .",
    "we now add an additional constraint from cosmology : we demand that the energy density in @xmath35 at time @xmath79 be sub - dominant , i.e. [ bound ] m_^2 ^2(t_e ) t^4(t_e ) ~ h^2(t_e ) m_pl^2 , where @xmath93 denotes the temperature of radiation , and where in the second step we have again used the friedmann equations .",
    "recalling that @xmath94 , the inequality ( [ bound ] ) yields an upper bound on @xmath95 : [ bound2 ] ( t_e ) m_pl , a bound which is quite natural from the point of view of particle physics ( we can not trust the physics we used for field values larger than @xmath92 ) . inserting the bound ( [ bound2 ] ) into ( [ final3 ] ) , we obtain a bound on the strength of our baryogenesis scenario of the form [ final4 ] n_b s y_^2 y _ ( m_pl ) ^1/2 .",
    "this result demonstrates that our dynamical cp violation scenario can lead , even in the case of small coupling constants , to a large net baryon to entropy ratio .",
    "there are other ways of transferring a cp asymmetry in the scalar sector to the lepton sector . in this section ,",
    "we briefly describe some alternative mechanisms .",
    "* asymmetry due to scattering : * in sec .  3 , we considered the possibility that a cp - violating asymmetry in the scalar sector can be generated in the decay @xmath96 .",
    "this is then converted to a cp asymmetry in the lepton sector via the decay of @xmath1 scalars into neutrinos . however",
    ", a cp asymmetry in the scalar sector can also be created by scattering processes such as @xmath97 .",
    "this process is generated by the quartic interaction @xmath98 in ( [ pot2 ] ) and has an one - loop vertex correction due to the cubic interaction @xmath99 generated in ( [ cubic2 ] ) .",
    "once again , the asymmetry comes about because the coupling of @xmath1 to @xmath0 is complex , but @xmath100 interactions are real .",
    "this leads to a phase difference between the tree diagram and the one - loop vertex correction graph , and contributes to the asymmetry .",
    "the relevant feynman graph for this process is shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "= 1.9 in    the asymmetry which is generated between the cross - sections for @xmath1 and @xmath101 production ( via the cp - conjugate process ) is - |~ ( )  ;   =  .",
    "[ phi2asym ] in ( [ phi2asym ] ) @xmath86 is the center of mass energy for the scattering process and @xmath5 is the relevant quartic coupling in ( [ pot2 ] ) . following ( [ phi2asym ] ) , the asymmetry in the rate of @xmath1 production is _ _ 2 = ( - | ) n__2 = n__2  , [ rateasym ] where @xmath102 is the number density of the scattering of @xmath1 particles . and @xmath1 fields . ]    once again , in this case , the lepton asymmetry is generated by allowing the scalar @xmath1 to decay via the process @xmath103 .",
    "the lepton number asymmetry generated in this way is proportional to the yukawa coupling [ ( [ dasym ] ) ] : y_d_2 ^ 2 _ _ 2= n__2  .",
    "[ dasyms ] the interesting aspect of ( [ dasyms ] ) is that the asymmetry could be large for large values of @xmath102 , even if the yukawa coupling is small .",
    "simultaneously , the wash - out factor is not large because the inverse scattering may be kinematically suppressed if the initial masses are large compared to the final state masses . in our case",
    ", we have @xmath104 and we expect @xmath105 due to small yukawa couplings",
    ".    one can also produce a lepton - number asymmetry directly via the pair production of dirac fermions in the scattering process @xmath106 .",
    "the relevant diagrams are shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "taking the final state to be @xmath107 , we obtain an asymmetry which is approximately given by y_g|d_d_e d_e",
    "d_| n__2  . [ dasymf ] the asymmetry in ( [ dasymf ] ) is smaller that that generated in ( [ dasyms ] ) due to a larger yukawa suppression .",
    "= 1.9 in    finally , a word about majorana neutrinos .",
    "the above asymmetry which we have generated is suppressed if we use majorana neutrinos .",
    "this follows due to spin statistics , where we notice that our scalars have to generate final states in the p - wave mode and hence the scenario is disfavored if it involves majorana neutrinos .",
    "* exotic fermions : * finally , it is also possible to construct scenarios involving the use of exotic fermions to transfer the cp violation to the fermion sector . although we will not discuss such models in any detail , there are many possibilities . for example , the scalar fields @xmath2 can couple to such ( neutral or charged ) exotic fermion fields , so that the cp asymmetry in the @xmath2 is then transferred to the exotic fermion sector .",
    "the subsequent decays of exotic fermions into ordinary fermions creates the necessary lepton - number asymmetry .",
    "in this paper we have elaborated on the scenario of dynamical cosmological cp violation we proposed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the cp violating - phases are due to cosmological initial conditions for some new scalar fields @xmath2 ( which could be some of the moduli fields emerging from new physics at very high energies ) . here , we have focused on how to transfer the cp asymmetry from the scalar sector to the leptonic sector , and on the connection with baryogenesis .",
    "we mention several ways to achieve the transfer of the cp asymmetry to the leptonic sector .",
    "one intriguing possibility is that yukawa couplings between the scalar field @xmath2 and the standard model leptons could generate a transient ( in time ) mns(p ) matrix which generates a cp asymmetry in the leptonic sector , yielding an implementation of leptogenesis . in this model",
    ", we estimate the resulting net baryon to entropy ratio .",
    "as expected , the result depends on the initial values of the scalar fields .",
    "we find , however , that it is easy to generate a sufficiently large baryon asymmetry to explain the data , even if the coupling constants and the value of the cp violating phase in the scalar sector are small .",
    "note that our scenario does not assume any new sources of cp and baryon - number violation in the lagrangian .",
    "the cp violation comes from the scalar field initial conditions , and the baryon asymmetry is generated via sphalerons from an asymmetry in the left - handed leptons , an asymmetry which is compensated by an asymmetry in the right - handed leptons .",
    "a prediction of this scenario is that there should be an asymmetry in the number of right - handed neutrinos commensurate with the observed net baryon to entropy ratio .",
