    "breaking scale invariance explicitly , e.g. by introducing a fermion mass term in the action , and studying the scaling of field correlators as the breaking parameter tends to zero , has become a common way to characterise irfps in lattice studies e.g. @xcite .",
    "a theoretical understanding of the scaling laws is a necessary tool for these analyses , and a number of useful ( hyperscaling ) relations have already been investigated in our previous work @xcite . working out these scaling relations",
    "is an interesting theoretical problem , independently of its application to the analysis of lattice data .",

    "we discuss here the application of the scaling laws to a number of interesting physical cases , namely the scaling of the hadron size , the scaling corrections , and the determination of selection rules for field correlators .",
    "the fact that hadrons emerge in a mcgt is a non - trivial empirical fact . at least at weak coupling",
    "this can be understood as a consequence of the fermions decoupling below the mass @xmath3 , so that the low - energy dynamics should be described by a pure yang - mills effective theory , which is believed to be of confining nature @xcite . in practical lattice simulations confinement",
    "is identified through a non - vanishing expectation value for the polyakov loop , and it is characteried by the spectrum of the bound states that determine the correlators of gauge invariant interpolating fields as in qcd . in such a theory all hadronic parameters are controlled to leading order by the coupling @xmath3 , which breaks explicitly scale invariance , and whose scaling exponent characterises the long - distance dynamics .",
    "this is clearly at odds with the behaviour observed in qcd , where chiral symmetry breaking requires the goldstone bosons to be massless in the chiral limit , while the rest of the spectrum has a finite mass , which is dictated by some typical hadronic scale .",
    "we shall refer to the bound states of an mcgt as _",

    "being able to characterise the size of @xmath3-hadrons , and to compute the scaling of the size with the fermion mass is crucial in order to understand finite - size effects ( fse ) in the results of numerical simulations .",
    "when the volume of the lattice is not large enough to accommodate the @xmath3-hadrons , fse distort the spectrum , and may well obscure the scaling behaviour that one is trying to identify .",

    "the direction @xmath43 is relevant and irrelevant at uv and irfp respectively whereas @xmath42 is irrelevant at both fixed points .",

    "current lattice results seem to suggest that this is indeed the case for the theories that have been investigated so far",
    ". nevertheless it might be the case that four quark operators @xmath49 that do appear for example in extended technicolor ( tc ) models , become relevant , i.e. @xmath50 . in this case",
    "a situation like the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3-types ] ( right ) will apply : in the very far ir this operator will grow and drive the system away from the fixed point ; both the mass of the fermions and this additional coupling need to be tuned for the system to be on the critical surface .",

    ". this would be the equivalent of finding a perfect action for the irfp . in practice , e.g. when setting the bare parameters in a simulation at finite lattice spacing , it is impossible to tune the system exactly to this point .",
    "the simple plaquette action does contain higher dimensional couplings by construction , and an infinite amount of tuning is needed to find a perfect action .",
    "thus summa summarum the study of the scaling dimension of higher dimensional operators within mcgt will remain an important topic in practice .",
    "in this section we characterise the size of hadronic states in mcgts by studying the radius of their charge distribution .",

    "note that the structure @xmath59 vanishes by virtue of current conservation : @xmath60 . the function @xmath61 is known as a form factor : its value at zero momentum corresponds to the charge of @xmath52 under the current @xmath62 , and its derivative corresponds to the square of the charge distribution c.f .",
    "appendix [ app : charge ] .",
    "for instance for the pion form factor in qcd , @xmath63 we wish to emphasise that is not related to the pion s special role in qcd as should be clear from the notes in the appendix [ app : charge ]",
    ". we shall later on contrast the behaviour of the pion charge radius in qcd with the charge radius of a generic @xmath3-hadron . in order to determine the scaling exponents , following the notation in @xcite , we define @xmath64 and",
    "shall assume that the derivatives exist .",
    "our main interest is to establish the behaviour of the size of the @xmath3-hadrons as a function of the relevant perturbation @xmath3 .",
    "we will proceed in two steps : ( i ) we derive the relative difference @xmath65 , and ( ii ) we determine @xmath66 .",
    "* the mass dependence of the form factor , @xmath67 for shorthand , is summarised in a scaling law akin to eq .",
    ": @xmath68 where the dots stand for higher terms in the taylor expansion .",
    "note there is no dependence on the rg - scale as the current is conserved . from eq .",
    "it is immediate to deduce @xmath69 * second we shall show @xmath70 .",
    "it follows directly from our master formula @xcite : @xmath71 where @xmath72 are physical states .",
    "we note that @xmath73 ( since @xmath62 is a conserved current ) and that @xmath74 which implies that @xmath75 .",
    "since the energy momentum vector is free from anomalous scaling it counts like its engineering dimension in the formula in the nominator of the exponent in and therefore @xmath76 ( i.e. @xmath77 ) . another way to arrive at the same result is to notice that @xmath78 is equal to the charge and since the latter can not scale with external parameters like the mass this implies that @xmath78 is independent of the mass and thus @xmath77 .",
    "putting the two results together we get : @xmath79 and for the mean charge radius squared we obtain : @xmath80 where @xmath81 denotes the mass of the hadron @xmath52 and we have used the general result @xmath82 derived for the entire hadronic spectrum in ref .",
    "thus in summary the size of the @xmath3-hadrons is inversely proportional to the hadronic mass . whereas this result does not seem surprising it is of importance for controlling fse on the lattice .",
    "whereas the scaling laws gives information on the relative size of hadrons for different values of @xmath3 it does not determine its absolute size @xmath83 .",
    "the determination of @xmath84 could then be pursued by a measurement of the slope of the form factor through eq .  .",
    "using twisted boundary conditions could help in improving the momentum resolution , and hence in resolving better the slope of the form factor .",
    "the discussion of finite size effects in the context of the form factor can be found in appendix [ app : chargefse ] .    it would seem that the arguments of the form factor of a scalar coupled to a conserved current ought to generalise to higher spin hadrons .",
    "the application to the analogue of the proton electromagnetic form factor should be rather straightforward . in general a more detailed analysis",
    "would necessitate the consideration of the corresponding polarisation tensors .",
    "suppose two higher spin hadrons couple to an operator @xmath22 that is not necessarily related to a physical charge .",
    "even though @xmath85 in general , we anticipate that the extension of the overlap with the operator @xmath22 is determined by based which in turn follows from generic scaling arguments .",
    "let us briefly open a parenthesis here . since @xmath86 with @xmath87 ( c.f . fig .",
    "[ fig : coupling ] for an explanation of @xmath88 ) , @xmath89 , one concludes that for @xmath90 at least for sufficiently small @xmath3 to overcome the unknown @xmath91-coefficient discussed above .",
    "other than that the hierarchy is controlled by the positivity of @xmath92 which is of course dependent on the actual gauge theory .",
    "furthermore whereas the unitarity bound implies @xmath93 no lower bound exists other than the fact that for @xmath94 the operator becomes irrelevant which goes against our working assumption as well as all results , known to the authors , in the literature .",
    "it is interesting to contrast the behaviour of the mean charge radius of the ( pseudo)scalar meson in mcgt to the one obtained for the goldstone boson in qcd .",
    "more precisely , since in both cases the masses vanish in the limit @xmath95 it is clear from a heuristic viewpoint that , for a state with sharp momentum , the particle can not be localised and therefore one expects the charge radius to diverge .",
    "the functional behaviour of the divergence is though not clear a priori . in a theory where chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken ,",
    "the dynamics of the light goldstone bosons is described by chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the mean charge radius can be computed in perturbation theory , and it is found to diverge logarithmically with the pion mass @xcite .",
    "this difference suggests that the existence of a conformal fixed point could be characterised by studying the scaling of @xmath96 for the pseudoscalar meson .",
    "we wish to reemphasize @xcite that the scaling laws for the mass parameter imply that there is no remnant of the pion as a pseudo goldstone boson in a mcgt .",

    "in general we expect the constant to be finite with the possible caveat that the correlator , which is generally not a physical observable , is affected by ir - divergences .",
    "this criterion is unfortunately of limited use for standard gauge theories . in recent years",

    "these couplings are absent in the gauge theories currently studied on the lattice , and therefore it would seem that ir - conformal theories are indeed ir - conformal and not just ir - scale - invariant .",
    "let us add to this end that , currently , the only logical possibility for scale invariant theories to exist is if the theories can evade the strong version of the a - theorem at the non - perturbative level  @xcite , as the latter has been shown to be valid in perturbation theory some time ago  @xcite .      in the previous paragraph",
    "we discussed a possible recipe for discerning theories that have only one ( flavour independent ) coupling , and that are cfts and not sfts .",
    "the selection rules can also be useful in distinguishing cfts ( ir - conformal ) from confining theories . in the following",
