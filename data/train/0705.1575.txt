    "nonleptonic @xmath7-meson decays are of crucial importance to deepen our insights into the flavor structure of the standard model  ( sm ) , the origin of cp violation , and the dynamics of hadronic decays , as well as to search for any signals of new physics beyond the sm . however , due to the non - perturbative strong interactions involved in these decays , the task is hampered by the computation of matrix elements between the initial and the final hadron states . in order to deal with these complicated matrix elements reliably , several novel methods based on the naive factorization approach  ( fa )  @xcite , such as the qcd factorization approach  ( qcdf )  @xcite , the perturbation qcd method  ( pqcd )  @xcite , and the soft - collinear effective theory  ( scet )  @xcite , have been developed in the past few years .",
    "these methods have been used widely to analyze the hadronic @xmath7-meson decays , while they have very different understandings for the mechanism of those decays , especially for the case of heavy - light final states , such as the @xmath0 decays .",
    "presently , all these methods can give good predictions for the color allowed @xmath8 mode , but for the color suppressed @xmath9 mode , the qcdf and the scet methods could not work well , and the pqcd approach seems leading to a reasonable result in comparison with the experimental data .",
    "in this situation , it is interesting to study various approaches and find out a reliable approach .",
    "as the mesons are regarded as quark and anti - quark bound states , the nonleptonic two body meson decays concern three quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "it is then natural to investigate the nonleptonic two body meson decays within the qcd framework by considering all feynman diagrams which lead to three effective currents of two quarks . in our considerations , beyond these sophisticated pqcd , qcdf and scet",
    ", we shall try to find out another simple reliable qcd approach to understand the nonleptonic two body decays . in this note",
    ", we are focusing on evaluating the @xmath0 decays .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii , we first analyze the relevant feynman diagrams and then outline the necessary ingredients for evaluating the branching ratios and @xmath3 asymmetries of @xmath10 decays . in sect .",
    "iii , we list amplitudes of @xmath0 decays .",
    "the approaches for dealing with the physical - region singularities of gluon and quark propagators are given in sect .",
    "finally , we discuss the branching ratios and the @xmath3 asymmetries for those decay modes and give conclusions in sects .",
    "v and vi , respectively .",
    "the detail calculations of amplitudes for these decay modes are given in the appendix .",
    "we start from the four - quark effective operators in the effective weak hamiltonian , and then calculate all the feynman diagrams which lead to effective six - quark interactions .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for @xmath12 decays can be expressed as @xmath13+{\\rm h.c.},\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the wilson coefficients which have been evaluated at next - to - leading order  @xcite , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the tree operators arising from the @xmath18-boson exchanges with @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the @xmath22 color indices .",

    "( [ heff ] ) , we can then calculate the decay amplitudes for @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 decays , which are the color - allowed , the color - suppressed , and the color - allowed plus color - suppressed modes , respectively .",

    ", the decay amplitude of this mode can be written as @xmath29 .",
    "the explicit expressions for the amplitudes of these decay modes are given in detail in next section .",
    "the decay amplitudes of @xmath11 decay modes are quite different .",
    "for the color - allowed @xmath8 mode , it is expected that the decay amplitude is dominated by the factorizable contribution @xmath30  ( from the diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ tree ] ) , while the nonfactorizable contribution @xmath31  ( from the diagrams ( c ) and ( d ) in fig .  [ tree ] ) has only a marginal impact .",
    "this is due to the fact that the former is proportional to the large coefficient @xmath32 , while the latter is proportional to the quite small coefficient @xmath33 .",
    "in addition , there is an addition color - suppressed factor @xmath34 in the nonfactorizable contribution @xmath31 .",
    "in contrast with the @xmath8 mode , the nonfactorizable contribution @xmath31  ( from ( c ) and ( d ) diagrams in fig .  [ tree2 ] ) in the @xmath9 mode is proportional to the large coefficient @xmath32 , and even if with an additional color - suppressed factor @xmath34 , its contribution is still larger than the factorizable one @xmath30  ( from ( a ) and ( b ) diagrams in fig .",
    "[ tree2 ] ) which is proportional to the quite small coefficient @xmath33 .",
    "thus , it is predicted that the decay amplitude of this mode is dominated by the nonfactorizable contribution @xmath31 . as for the @xmath35 mode , since its amplitude can be written as the sum of the ones of the above two modes , it is not easy to see which one should dominate the total amplitude .",
    "the branching ratio for @xmath0 decays can be expressed as follows in terms of the total decay amplitudes @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the lifetime of the @xmath7 meson , and @xmath38 is the magnitude of the momentum of the final - state particles @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the @xmath7-meson rest frame and given by @xmath41\\ , \\left[m_b^2-(m_{d}-m_{\\pi})^2\\,\\right]}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as is well - known , the direct @xmath3 violation in meson decays is non - zero only if there are two contributing amplitudes with non - zero relative weak and strong phases .",
    "the weak - phase difference usually arises from the interference between two different topological diagrams . for three @xmath0 decays ,",
    "it is seen from the feynman diagrams in figs .",
    "[ tree]-[annihilation ] that there are no weak - phase differences , and hence no direct @xmath3 violation in all these three modes , we shall then consider the mixing - induced @xmath3 violation .    as the final states @xmath42 can be produced both in the decays of @xmath43 meson via the cabibbo - favored  ( @xmath44 ) and in the decays of @xmath45 meson via the doubly cabibbo - suppressed  ( @xmath46 ) tree amplitudes .",
    "the relative weak - phase difference between these two amplitudes is @xmath47 and , when combining with the @xmath48 mixing phase , the total weak - phase difference is @xmath49 to all orders in the small ckm parameter @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the @xmath51 decays can in principle be used to measure the weak phase @xmath52 , since the weak phase @xmath53 has been measured with high precision .",
    "the time - dependent @xmath3 asymmetry of such decay modes is defined as : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the mass difference of the two eigenstates of @xmath56 mesons , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are given as @xmath59 with @xmath60 where the rephase - invariant quantities @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 @xcite characterize the indirect , direct and mixing - induced cp violations respectively . as @xmath64 for neutral @xmath7 system",
    ", we have @xmath65 which characterizes direct cp violation . defining @xmath66 and @xmath67 as the amplitudes of @xmath68 and @xmath69 decay modes , respectively",
    ", we can further express these two cp asymmetries as @xmath70 where @xmath71 , and @xmath72 represents the relative strong - phase difference between the two amplitudes @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "similarly , we can define another two @xmath3-violating parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 for the @xmath75 decays @xmath76 with the parameter @xmath77 defined as @xmath78 are the charge conjugations of the amplitudes @xmath67 and @xmath66 .",
    "since the magnitude of the cabibbo - suppressed decay amplitude @xmath79 is much smaller than that of the cabibbo - favored decay amplitude @xmath80 , the ratio @xmath81 should be quite small and is found to be about @xmath82 in our framework .",
    "thus , to a very good approximation , @xmath83 , and the coefficients of the sine terms are given by @xmath84 to compare with the current experimental data , one usually define the following two quantities , which are given by the combination of two @xmath3-violating parameters @xmath57 and @xmath74 , @xmath85 which can provide constraints on the weak phase @xmath6 and the strong phase @xmath86 .",

    ", we may introduce an intrinsic mass scale realized in the symmetry - preserving loop regularization@xcite . at the tree level",
    ", it is equivalent to adopt an effective dynamical gluon mass in the propagator .",
    "practically , such a gluon mass scale has been used to regulate the infrared divergences in the soft endpoint region  @xcite @xmath127^{-\\frac{12}{11}},\\ ] ] the use of this effective gluon propagator is supported by the lattice  @xcite and the field theoretical studies  @xcite , which have shown that the gluon propagator is not divergent as fast as @xmath128 . taking the hadronic scale @xmath129 , the dynamical gluon mass scale can be determined from one of the well measured decay mode . numerically , we will see that taking @xmath130  mev , the dynamical gluon mass scale is around @xmath131 .",
    "another physical - region singularity arises from the on mass - shell quark propagators .",
    "it can be easily checked that each feynman diagram contributing to a given matrix element is entirely real unless some denominators vanish with a physical - region singularity , so that the @xmath132 prescription for treating the poles becomes relevant . in other words",
    ", a feynman diagram will yield an imaginary part for the decay amplitudes only when the virtual particles in the diagram become on mass - shell , thus the diagram may be considered as a genuine physical process .",
    "the cutkosky rules  @xcite give a compact expression for the discontinuity across the cut arising from a physical - region singularity .",
    "when applying the cutkosky rules to deal with a physical - region singularity of quark propagators , the following formula holds @xmath133-i\\pi\\delta[(k_1-k_2-k_3)^2],\\label{quarkd}\\\\ \\frac{1}{(p_b - k_2-k_3)^2-m_b^2+i\\epsilon}&=&p\\biggl[\\frac{1 } { ( p_b - k_2-k_3)^2-m_b^2}\\biggl]-i\\pi\\delta[(p_b - k_2-k_3)^2-m_b^2 ] , \\label{quarkb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath134 denotes the principle - value prescription .",
    "the role of the @xmath86 function is to put the particles corresponding to the intermediate state on their positive energy mass - shell , so that in the physical region , the individual feynman diagram satisfies the unitarity condition . equations ( [ quarkd ] ) and ( [ quarkb ] ) will be applied to the quark propagators @xmath135 and @xmath136 in equation ( [ anni1 ] ) , respectively .",
    "it is then seen that the possible large imaginary parts arise from the virtual quarks across their mass shells as physical - region singularities .",
    "it is seen that for theoretical predictions it depends on many input parameters , such as the wilson coefficient functions , the ckm matrix elements , the hadronic parameters , and so on . to carry out a numerical calculation ,",

    "in summary , we have calculated the decay amplitudes , strong phases , branching ratios , and @xmath3 asymmetries for the @xmath0 decays , including both the color - allowed and the color - suppressed modes .",
    "it has been shown that these decay modes are theoretically clean as there are no penguin contributions . as a consequence ,",
    "direct @xmath3 violations are absent .",
    "the contributions from the factorizable diagrams dominate all the decay amplitudes except for the @xmath142 process .",
    "all our predictions for branching ratios are consistent with the existing measurements . for the @xmath143 mode",
    ", our predictions will be faced with the future experiments as no data are available at present .",
    "due to small interference effects between the cabibbo - suppressed and the cabibbo - favored amplitudes , the non - zero @xmath3-violating parameters @xmath57 and @xmath74 have been predicted in the @xmath144 decay modes .",
    "it has been shown that the @xmath3-violating parameters have a strong dependence on the weak phase @xmath6 , but they are not sensitive to the dynamical gluon mass scale . with the angle @xmath6 varying within the range @xmath145 ,",
    "almost all of the values for the cp - violating parameters @xmath146 and @xmath147 are within the range of the current experimental data .",
    "thus no constraints on the weak phase @xmath6 could be obtained through those parameters based on the current experiment data , and more precise measurements are needed in future experiments .    in this paper , we have further shown that the divergence treatments used in our previous work  @xcite are reliable .",
    "namely , the endpoint divergence caused by the soft collinear approximation in gluon propagator could be simply avoided by adopting the cornwall prescription for the gluon propagator with a dynamical mass scale .",
    "note that when the intrinsic mass is appropriately introduced , it may not spoil the gauge symmetry as shown recently in the symmetry - preserving loop regularization  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , for the physical - region singularity of the on - mass - shell quark propagators , it can well be treated by applying for the cutkosky rules .",
    "the combination of these two treatments for the endpoint divergences of gluon propagator and the physical - region singularity of the quark propagators enables us to obtain reasonable results , which are consistent with the existing experimental data and also in agreement with the ones  @xcite obtained by using the pqcd approach .",
    "however , this is different from the treatment of the latter , where @xmath148 and sudakov factors have been used to avoid the endpoint divergence .",
    "it is noted that the resulting predictions for the branching ratios are in general scale dependence on the dynamical gluon mass which plays the role of the ir cut - off .",
    "this dependence should in principle be compensated from the possible scale in the wave functions which characterizes the nonperturbative effects . in our approach",
    ", the dynamical gluon mass may be regarded as a universal scale to be fixed from one of the decay modes .",
    "for instance , in our present considerations , if the decay mode @xmath149 is taken to extract the dynamical gluon mass scale , we have @xmath150 mev , and the resulting predictions for other decay modes can serve as a consistent check . within the current experimental errors and theoretical uncertainties for some relevant parameters",
    ", it is seen that our treatment is reliable . in order to further check the validity of the gluon - mass regulator method adopted to deal with the endpoint divergence , it is useful to extend this method to more decay modes . anyway",
