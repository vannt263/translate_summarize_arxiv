    "emulsions are mixtures of two immiscible fluids consisting of droplets of one phase dispersed into the other , stabilized against coalescence by surfactant . at low droplets volume fraction ,",
    "the emulsions have basically a newtonian behavior @xcite .",
    "when the volume fraction of the dispersed phase is increased , droplets come into contact .",
    "if a small stress is applied to a dense emulsion , the interfaces between the droplets can be strained to store surface energy ; it results in an elastic response @xcite . above a yield stress , they flow as a result of droplets rearrangements @xcite .",
    "the flow behavior of dense emulsions can be measured in classical rheological experiments , and seems to be well represented by a herschel - bulkley model @xmath1 ; in monodisperse emulsions , the exponent @xmath2 has been found to vary between @xmath3 and @xmath4 for volume fractions varying between 0.58 and 0.65 @xcite . at first glance ,",
    "dense emulsions behavior thus seems to be well understood and modelled .",
    "however , it has been shown recently that the behavior of dense emulsions @xcite , and more generally of pasty materials @xcite , may be much more complex than what can be inferred from simple rheometric experiments , particularly at the approach of the yield stress .",
    "the reason is that the flow behavior of materials is usually studied in viscosimetric flows @xcite , in which one measures macroscopic quantities ( a torque @xmath5 vs. a rotational velocity @xmath6 ) . a constitutive law relating the shear stress @xmath7 to the shear rate @xmath8 in any flow",
    "can then be derived easily from these macroscopic measurements provided that the flow is homogeneous . however , in complex fluids , this last requirement may not be fulfilled as the flow may be localized , as observed in many pasty materials @xcite , even in the cone - and - plate geometry @xcite .",
    "another problem of importance , that can complicate the analysis of the rheological data , is the existence of slippage of dense emulsions at the walls @xcite even with slightly roughened walls @xcite .",
    "these problems can be got round by coupling macroscopic torque measurements and local measurements of the shear rate , e.g. through mri techniques @xcite , optical methods @xcite or sound methods @xcite , in order to account for these heterogeneities and to get a proper constitutive law .",
    "local measurements in dense emulsions have recently yielded surprising results @xcite : in some emulsions , it is impossible to find a single constitutive law compatible with all flows .",
    "the constitutive law of the material then seems to depend on the velocity at the inner cylinder in a couette cell @xcite or the pressure gradient in a poiseuille cell @xcite .",
    "three main reasons have been evoked to explain the apparent absence of a constitutive law : thixotropy , non local effects , and shear - induced migration of the droplets .",
    "thixotropy may be a cause from the apparent absence of a constitutive law .",
    "long times may indeed be needed to reach a steady state . when the measurements are not performed in this steady state",
    ", it may then leave the idea that different laws are required to describe the flow of the sample . such long times to reach steady state have been evidenced in some experiments dealing with highly adhesive emulsion @xcite .",
    "importantly , @xcite , although they claim to have reached a steady state , were unable to account for the flows of their adhesive emulsion with a single constitutive law .",
    "note that we will study again the emulsion of @xcite in this paper .",
    "the apparent absence of a single local constitutive law may also be the signature of non - local phenomena .",
    "@xcite have actually proposed a non local model to describe the flows of jammed materials ( and thus dense emulsions ) , based upon the cooperativity of the flow . in these systems",
    ", flow occurs via a succession of elastic deformation and irreversible plastic events .",
    "these localized plastic events induce a relaxation of the stress on the whole system .",
    "their zone of influence is quantified by a length @xmath9 . in presence of high stress gradient or in the vicinity of a surface , this process creates non local effects : indeed , in these situations , the rate of rearrangements of the neighboring fluid differs from what would be the bulk rearrangement rate . as a consequence , these effects affect drastically the rheological behavior when @xmath9 is comparable to the size of the confinement .",
    "such behavior has been recently pointed out by @xcite . from experimental data ,",
    "the authors show that the cooperativity length @xmath9 is zero below the jamming concentration @xmath10 and is typically a few oil droplet diameters above @xmath10 . using a wide gap",
    "should then prevent us from being sensitive to these non local effects .",
    "we will check this feature by studying the flows of the @xcite emulsion in this paper .",
    "particle migration may also be a cause for the apparent lack of a local constitutive law @xcite .",
    "in multiphase materials , wide gap couette flows are indeed known to lead to concentration heterogeneities due to shear - induced migration of the dispersed elements toward the low shear zones .",
    "the migration of deformable particles , and particularly drops , has been much less studied than the one of rigid particles .",
    "single droplets have been found to migrate away from the rigid walls in any shear flow , due to asymmetric flows around deformed droplets @xcite .",
    "this leads to an equilibrium position somewhere between the walls , exactly at the center of the gap in the case of a narrow gap couette geometry , nearer from the inner cylinder in the case of a wide gap couette geometry @xcite .",
    "when dealing with a dilute emulsion , it has been observed , in contrast with dilute suspensions of rigid particles , that the equilibrium distribution of droplets is parabolic around a position that is near the equilibrium position of single droplets @xcite .",
    "the theoretical explanation is that all particles would tend to accumulate at the same equilibrium position between the walls , but their distribution is broadened by their binary collisions ( this second process may be modelled as it is for rigid particles ) .",
    "only rather dilute emulsions ( up to 10% of droplets ) have been studied so far , and nothing is known about what happens for higher droplet concentrations . in this case , one would expect the wall effect on the droplet migration to be negligible compared to the effect of the interactions between droplets ; then , one would expect migration to product the same effects as in suspensions , with the same kinetics as it has basically the same physical origin .",
    "we can thus expect that relevant information for migration in dense emulsions can be found in the literature dealing with suspensions of rigid particles . in suspensions of noncolloidal rigid particles , migration has been observed in many situations : wide - gap couette flows @xcite , parallel - plate flows @xcite , pipe flows @xcite . in wide - gap couette flows ,",
    "the consequence of migration is an excess of particles near the outer cylinder .",
    "migration is related to the shear - induced diffusion of particles @xcite : the gradients in shear rate that exist in all but the cone and plate geometry generate a particle flux towards the low shear zones ( the outer cylinder in the case of the couette geometry ) , which is counterbalanced by a particle flux due to viscosity gradients . in an alternative model",
    "@xcite , particle fluxes counterbalance the gradients in normal stresses .",
    "most experiments @xcite observe that migration in suspensions of volume fraction up to 55% is rather slow , in accordance with its diffusive origin .",
    "however , it was recently found in a couette geometry that in the case of very dense suspensions ( up to 60% ) , which exhibit an apparent yield stress , migration is almost instantaneous @xcite ( it lasts for a few revolutions ) so that it may be unavoidable .",
    "a reason for this very fast kinetics may be that particles are closely packed together : any shear may then push the particles towards the outer cylinder with an instantaneous long range effect on the particle concentration .",
    "migration may then be expected to be very fast for dense emulsions exhibiting a yield stress , i.e. in which droplets are in contact as the particles in the very dense suspensions of @xcite .    in this paper , we address the questions of the existence and the determination of a local constitutive law for the flows of dense emulsions . in this aim , we use a wide gap couette cell to avoid non local effects and we study in detail the question of shear - induced droplet migration in these systems .",
    "we also take care of performing our experiments in a steady state .",
    "we propose to couple macroscopic measurements and local measurements of concentration and velocity through mri techniques during the wide gap couette flows of dense emulsions .",
    "a new method designed to measure the local droplet concentration in emulsions is developed and we seek for the occurrence of migration on many formulations .",
    "local measurements of the constitutive law are then compared to purely macroscopic measurements .    in sec .",
    "[ section_display ] , we present the materials and the experimental setup .",
    "we present the concentration profiles obtained on all materials after long time experiments in sec .",
    "[ section_concentration ] .",
    "the velocity profiles are shown in sec .",
    "[ section_velocity ] .",
    "the macroscopic rheometrical measurements are displayed in sec .",

    "the results are analyzed in sec .",
    "[ section_local ] : we determine locally the constitutive law of the material from the velocity profiles and we compare macroscopic and local measurements of the constitutive law .",
    "as the timescale for the occurrence of migration is _ a priori _ very sensitive to the droplet size @xmath11 ( if a diffusive process is involved , it should scale as @xmath12 ) , we study dense emulsions of 4 different sizes : 0.3@xmath0 m , 1@xmath0 m , 6.5@xmath0 m , and 40@xmath0 m . moreover , as problems in defining a local constitutive law seem to be linked to the adhesion properties of the droplets @xcite , we took care of formulating adhesive and non adhesive emulsions .",
    "note in particular that we study the emulsions of @xcite and @xcite which posed problems in defining a single local constitutive law accounting for all their flows .",
    "the 0.3@xmath0 m emulsion is the adhesive emulsion of @xcite ; nearly monodisperse oil in water emulsions are prepared by shearing a crude polydisperse emulsion , composed of castor oil droplets in water stabilized by sodium dodecyl sulfate ( sds ) , within a narrow gap of 100 @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "the surfactant concentration within the aqueous phase is set to 8% wt . which leads to an adhesive emulsion @xcite .",
    "the oil volume fraction is 73% and the droplet",
    "mean diameter is 0.3 @xmath0 m with a polydispersity of about 20% which is enough to prevent crystallization .",
    "the 1@xmath0 m emulsion is a non adhesive emulsion .",
    "the preparation of the sample is the same as the one used to get the adhesive 0.3@xmath0 m emulsion .",
    "it is composed of silicone oil in water stabilized by sodium dodecyl sulfate ( sds ) .",
    "the surfactant concentration within the aqueous phase is set to 8.5% .",
    "the viscosity of the oil is 1 pa.s and the oil volume fraction is 75% .",
    "we prepared adhesive and non - adhesive oil in water emulsions , of 6.5 @xmath0 m mean diameter with a polydispersity of about 20 @xmath13 .",
    "these emulsions are composed of silicone droplets in a mixture of glycerine and water ( 50% w glycerine , 50% w water ) stabilized by 1% wt of brij and trimethyl tetradecyl ammonium bromide , sheared in a narrow gap couette cell .",
    "the trimethyl tetradecyl concentration within the aqueous phase is set to 1 or 6.5 wt @xmath13 , which leads to respectively adhesive and non - adhesive emulsions .",
    "the oil viscosity is 1pa.s .",
    "the oil volume fraction is 75% in all cases .",
    "note that the non - adhesive 6.5@xmath0 m emulsion is the same as in @xcite .",
    "note that the use of glycerol in the continuous phase prevents from obtaining accurate concentration measurements with the method developed below .",
    "only qualitative results can be inferred from the measurements : in particular , if the intensity profiles are unchanged after a flow , it means that there is no migration .",
    "we finally studied a large droplet brine in oil non - adhesive emulsion , of 40 @xmath0 m mean diameter with a polydispersity of about 50 @xmath13 , at a 88% concentration .",
    "the emulsion is prepared by progressively adding the brine ( solution of cacl@xmath14 at 300g / l in water ) in an oil - surfactant solution ( hdf 2000 ( total solvent ) + sorbitan monooleate at 2% ) under a controlled high shear with a silverson l4rt mixer .",
    "we carried out experiments with a velocity controlled  magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) rheometer \" .",
    "experiments are performed within a wide - gap couette geometry ( inner cylinder radius @xmath15 cm , outer cylinder radius @xmath16 cm , height @xmath1711 cm ) . in order to avoid slip at the walls ,",
    "sandpaper is glued on the walls .",
    "rheometric measurements are performed with a commercial rheometer ( bohlin c - vor 200 ) that imposes either the torque or the rotational velocity ( with a torque feedback ) .",
    "the whole geometry is inserted in a 0.5 t vertical mri spectrometer ( 24/80 dbx by bruker ) .",
    "the mri measurements allow us to get the local orthoradial velocity and the local droplet concentration of the material anywhere in the gap , with a radial resolution of 0.5 mm . for details on the mri sequence devoted to measure",
    "the local velocity and its application to rheology , see @xcite .",
    "a method devoted to obtain the local droplet concentration was developed specifically for this study and is presented hereafter .",
    "proton nmr relies on the properties of hydrogen nuclei , which bear a magnetic dipole . in a nmr experiment",
    ", the sample is put inside a strong , static , and ( as far as possible ) homogeneous field @xmath18 .",
    "the magnetization of hydrogen nuclei then tend to align along the static field .",
    "the sample develops a non zero magnetization density @xmath19 which follows the curie law : m_o(r)=_h(r)b_o[eq_magnetization]where @xmath20 is the hydrogen density at position @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the gyromagnetic ratio of hydrogen nuclei , @xmath23 is the planck constant , @xmath24 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath25 is the sample temperature .",
    "@xmath20 can be easily computed for any sample from its chemical formula and its density .    when put out of equilibrium , magnetization of liquids",
    "often develops a threefold dynamic behavior combining a precession motion around the permanent field of the magnet , and two relaxation processes : a mono - exponential decay of transverse components of @xmath26 with a characteristic time @xmath27 , and a mono - exponential relaxation of the longitudinal component of @xmath26 towards its equilibrium value , with a characteristic time @xmath28 .",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance technique consists in series of magnetization manipulation and measurements by means of externally applied additional magnetic field , aiming at getting information about physico - chemical properties of the sample . the magnetic resonance imaging extension of nmr permits to get , as far a possible , a",
    "space resolved view of the local magnetization density , and can make such analysis local and non - perturbative .",
    "because of signal to noise ratio limitations , the space resolution of mri facilities for imaging purposes can never be much better than about one hundredth of the size of the experimental setup , that is 1 mm in our working conditions , which is much too big to resolve independent droplets .",
    "measuring the water / oil ratio in a sample then requires to have a way to distinguish oil and water magnetization inside a single pixel of a mri image .    up to now",
    ", three main discrimination routes were already reported in emulsion literature .",
    "the first one relies on the so - called chemical shift difference between water and oil .",
    "actually , the exact precession frequency around the permanent field is closely related to the direct chemical neighborhood of hydrogen atoms . because all hydrogen nuclei of water are linked to oxygen atoms , and most of hydrogens in oily material are linked either to carbon or silicium atoms , water and oil magnetization always exhibit two different precession frequency .",
    "this chemical shift is quite small ( about 4 - 4.5 ppm relative difference , whenever carbon or silicon oils are used ) .",
    "nevertheless this shift can be accurately observed provided that @xmath29 inhomogeneities across the sample have a much smaller amplitude than 4.5ppm of the mean @xmath30 value ( e.g. , see spectrum by @xcite).indeed , the precession frequency is also proportional to local @xmath31 intensity , and one should avoid confusion between the original chemical shift and any spurious one originating from field heterogeneities .",
    "homogeneity constraints can be met when the fluid is embedded in a container with a simple - shape .",
    "reported studies making use of the chemical shift contrast then often deal with emulsions that are contained in a simple beaker , or even a cylindrical pipe displayed parallel to @xmath29 .",
    "quite early results deal with the use of chemical shift imaging ( csi ) for a quantitative assessment of oil / fat content in food emulsions @xcite , or the separation of oil and water components of an emulsion during a filtration process @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite managed to carry out quite well resolved local measurements of water / oil concentrations and/or velocities in model suspensions flowing through a pipe in a laminar regime .",
    "unfortunately , the chemical shift contrast can hardly be transposed in the case of a couette cell .",
    "the geometry is indeed more complex and involves edges between materials with different magnetic susceptibilities , prone to generate strong local field distortions .",
    "csi applications to couette flow are thus more difficult and actually quite rare . for instance , @xcite , who studied the mixing process of oil and water in an horizontal couette like device reported quite long measuring times and only poorly resolved pictures .",
    "a second way to discriminate between water and oil in an emulsion relies on @xmath28 relaxation time .",
    "@xmath28 ( as well as @xmath27 ) indeed strongly depend on a wide set of parameters , such as fluid composition , diffusion coefficient , temperature , or the presence of dissolved species . in water and oil",
    ", they usually turn out to be quite different .",
    "for instance , in our working conditions ( 0.5 t magnetic field ) @xmath28 and @xmath27 usually range between 2 and 3s in bulk water ( depending on water origin and dissolved minerals ) , while many carbonated and silicon oils exhibit @xmath28 about few 100ms , and @xmath27 even smaller . although the use of @xmath27 contrast was already reported as a promising nmr tool of characterizing droplet size in an emulsion @xcite , previous works involving imaging possibilities of nmr prefer @xmath28 contrast . as compared with chemical shift or @xmath27 , @xmath28",
    "physical value and @xmath28 measurement techniques are indeed fairly insensitive to field inhomogeneities .",
    "@xcite demonstrated this contrast to give quantitative information on the creaming process of an oil - water emulsion .",
    "more recently , few works showed its ability to work in more severe conditions .",
    "@xcite used @xmath28 to measure the fat fraction in an emulsion contained inside the stomach of a human volunteer . @xcite",
    "also reported the use of a @xmath28 based method to follow the droplet migration in a low concentrated emulsion under shearing in a couette cell .",
    "a third way also used to study the creaming of an emulsion @xcite , consists in preparing a water - oil emulsion based on deuterium oxide instead of normal water . because proton nmr is only sensitive to 1h nuclei , nmr or mri measurements",
    "then bring exclusive information on the oil phase .    in our work , we wanted to get independent information on oil and water phase .",
    "field inhomogeneities inside our couette cell were also in many places of the same order of magnitude as the chemical shift .",
    "this was mainly due to the covering of the surfaces of the cell with sand - paper , that was used so as to avoid slip problems .",
    "@xmath28 contrast was then regarded as the best contrast source . although details of our measurement method was quite different than that of @xcite it was also based on the so - called inversion - recovery technique . starting from a magnetization in equilibrium state ,",
    "it consists in putting magnetization upside down by means of an appropriate external field , and then to let it relax towards its equilibrium value . in a homogeneous sample with relaxation time @xmath28 and equilibrium magnetization density @xmath32",
    ", the magnetization about the main magnetic field should then read m(t)=m_o(1 - 2e^-t / t_1)where @xmath33 at the time of inversion . to perform an accurate analysis",
    ", we found necessary to consider additionally that the initial inversion can never be perfect : the magnetization about the main magnetic field then actually reads m(t)=m_o(1-ie^-t",
    "/ t_1)where @xmath34 reflects the actual inversion conditions : @xmath34 would be equal to 2 in perfect experimental conditions , but was actually always found to be slightly less than 2 .",
    "its exact value and space homogeneity depends on both the hardware and the sample .    in a water - oil emulsion",
    ", it is admitted that water and oil behave as two independent phases : the resultant magnetization is then the sum of the individual oil and water magnetization that relax independently .",
    "the mean magnetization inside a water oil - emulsion then reads m(t)=^w m_o^w(1-i e^-t / t_1^w)+^o m_o^o(1-i e^-t / t_1^o)[eq_relaxation ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the equilibrium magnetization density of bulk water and oil respectively , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the water and oil volume fractions ( @xmath39 ) , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the longitudinal relaxation time of water and oil respectively .",
    "@xmath34 is supposed to be the same in oil and water .    from eq .",
    "[ eq_relaxation ] , in order to observe only water droplets in a water in oil emulsion , @xcite used the fact that there is always a time during this relaxation process when the oil magnetization is zero .",
    "they made a mri picture of @xmath42 at this time , based on the assumption that @xmath43 everywhere in the sample .",
    "however , we think that the accuracy of such technique may be limited , because a wrong estimation of the actual @xmath34 factor , if not exactly 2 , or a wrong estimation of relaxation times will always lead to a wrong estimation of the time for which the oil magnetization is zero , and then , to an incomplete oil cancelling .    using in situ measurements of water and oil relaxation times , we developed another approach which consists in performing 3 mri measurements of the magnetization relaxation , for 3 carefully chosen waiting times , and then in solving an equation system , letting @xmath34 as a free parameter .",
    "we then obtain space resolved measurements of @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 as averaged at the pixel scale .",
    "the three waiting times are optimized for each sample in order to minimize the uncertainty on the magnetization values .",
    "as compared with the phase cancelling technique , we calculated that this method is much more accurate , and especially less sensitive to @xmath28 uncertainties when @xmath28 values in water and oil are clearly separated .    in order to get the material volume fraction from eq .",
    "[ eq_relaxation ] , in situ measurement of relaxation times were found to be a necessary step of the experimental procedure .",
    "indeed , as far as relaxation phenomena are considered , although water and oil mainly behave as if they would be independent phases , they interact anyway together with the surfactant at the surface of each droplet . relaxation times in water may then be influenced by the presence of the oil phase .",
    "relaxation times in oil may also differ from that of pure oil because aliphatic chains of surfactant molecules mix with oil in the vicinity of the droplet surface .",
    "the sensitivity to the droplet size was reported to be quite dramatic for @xmath27 value in water / oil emulsion containing a large amount of additional impurities @xcite .",
    "we believe in such system that @xmath28 and @xmath27 should qualitatively behave the same . in our samples , which are made of quite pure",
    "water and oil phases , the @xmath28 difference between the pure phases and the droplets was found to be of order 10% .",
    "this difference is probably too small to provide a quantitative sensitivity of our measurements to droplet size changes in our systems .",
    "anyway , @xmath28 changes , as small as they may be , have to be taken into account for the accuracy of local fraction measurements .",
    "eventually , @xmath28 may also evolve with any small change in the temperature of the sample .",
    "that is why before each concentration measurement , the actual relaxation times were measured .    as @xmath28 is sensitive to the details of the local structure of the material , @xmath28 measurements should be ideally space resolved .",
    "however , we worked here another way : we used an average @xmath28 measurement in the whole gap of the cell , discriminating water and oil on the basis of their chemical shift ( field inhomogeneities were too strong for a csi - based imaging , but were still ok for @xmath28 measurements ) .",
    "the average @xmath28 values for oil and water were then directly used to process the mri data .",
    "granted that processed oil and water volume fractions were then always found to be homogeneous within the gap of the cell , we had then an a posteriori confirmation that our global @xmath28 measurement were meaningful",
    ". one should be aware anyway that if any heterogeneity would have been detected in measured volume fractions , then it would have been necessary to shift to local @xmath28 measurements to ensure very accurate quantitative results ; measurements based on the global @xmath28 measurement would nevertheless provide a relevant estimation of the volume fractions .    finally , in order to obtain the local volume fraction @xmath47 and @xmath48 of each phases , it is sufficient to remember that from eq .",
    "[ eq_magnetization ] : @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the absolute uncertainty on the concentration measurement performed with this method was found to be of 0.3% from measurements performed on a homogeneous emulsion .",
    "note that when the proton density of the oil phase is not known , the comparison of the @xmath45 and @xmath46 measurements performed on the homogeneous emulsion ( of known volume fraction ) allows to recover its value .",
    "note also that a simple way to check for changes in the local concentration , and to evaluate the amplitude of these changes , consists in comparing the water and oil intensity profiles within the gap after shear to the profiles measured on the emulsion just after loading .",
    "these last profiles are performed on a homogeneous emulsion , any change in these profiles induced by shear would then mean that there is migration .      in the experiments presented hereafter , we control the rotational velocity of the inner cylinder . for all materials ,",
    "we first apply a constant rotational velocity of 20rpm to 100rpm until 10000 to 90000 revolutions have been completed .",
    "we record the evolution of the velocity profiles and the concentration profiles in time in order to check for the occurrence of migration ( see sec .",
    "[ section_concentration ] ) .",
    "afterwards , we measure the stationary velocity profiles and the stationary torque exerted by the material on the inner cylinder for various velocities ranging from 0.1rpm to 100rpm ( see sec .",

    "in order to search for the occurrence of shear - induced migration in dense emulsions , we sheared all materials for long times .",
    "we chose to apply velocities ranging between 20 and 100 rpm ; this ensures that in all cases the whole gap is sheared ( see sec .",
    "[ section_velocity ] ) .",
    "we also checked on the 6.5@xmath0 m emulsions that the same results are obtained when the flow is localized during the experiment ( i.e. when the material is sheared at 1 rpm ) .",

    "results for the 0.3@xmath0 m and the 40@xmath0 m emulsion are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_emul_concentration ] .",
    "note also that the relaxation times @xmath28 of the oil and water phases were not observed to change during all the experiments : as pointed out in sec .",
    "[ section_display ] , this is consistent with the fact that the droplet size is unchanged by shear and that all the measurements deal with the same homogeneous suspension .",
    "consistently , optical observations of the droplets after shear did not reveal size changes .    as noted in sec .",
    "[ section_introduction ] , up to now only rather dilute emulsions have been studied : we can not compare our results with any result from the literature dealing with emulsions .",
    "however , the relevant mechanism involved in migration of droplets in dense emulsions should be basically the same as in suspensions of rigid particles , namely a shear - induced diffusion of particles . from this model and results from the literature of migration in dense suspension",
    ", we can thus infer whether or not migration would have been expected in our systems . in the diffusive model of migration @xcite",

    "the gradients in shear rate that exist in a couette geometry then generate a particle flux towards the outer cylinder , which is counterbalanced by a particle flux due to viscosity gradients . as qualitatively confirmed experimentally @xcite",

    ", we can now evaluate the expected @xmath61 for complete migration in our experiment from experimental results from literature .",
    "actually , as shown by @xcite two inconsistent set of data exist , depending on the concentration : migration has been shown to occur much more rapidly for concentrations above 55% .",

    "let us recall that @xmath61 is the number of revolutions expected for _ complete _ migration , and that heterogeneities should be observable for a value of @xmath74 revolutions ( see @xcite and @xcite for measurements of transient concentration profiles in suspensions ) .",
    "if a shear - induced migration mechanism similar to the one observed in suspensions of rigid particles was acting in dense emulsions , we should therefore have observed migration in the 40@xmath0 m emulsion and in the 6.5@xmath0 m emulsions . on the other hand ,",
    "our experiments can not be used to conclude directly for the failure of a diffusive model of migration in the case of the smaller droplets ( 0.3 and 1@xmath0 m ) , but we can expect to predict what happens in this case from the @xmath75 scaling of the diffusion process if this process is relevant . even if it impossible to conclude definitely for the absence of migration for any strain , we can conclude that if a diffusive process acts in dense emulsions , it is much slower than the process involved in dense suspensions of rigid particles .",
    "importantly , our results provide reliable lower bounds for the occurrence of migration in dense emulsions . for practical purposes , in most flows and particularly in most rheometrical studies of dense emulsions",
    ", it can therefore be claimed that the emulsions remain homogeneous .",
    "surprisingly , our results contrast with what was observed by @xcite in dense suspensions of hard spheres where very fast migration was found to occur .",
    "a first reason could be that jamming prevents from migration in dense emulsions .",
    "however , it was found that migration in dense suspensions can lead to regions having a concentration higher than the maximum packing fraction @xmath10 above which there is no more flow @xcite : this shows that jamming does not necessarily prevents from migration .",
    "another reason could be that deformability of the particles play a central role .",
    "the shear stresses involved in the flow are of the order of 100 to 200 pa in all materials , whereas the typical stress due to surface tension range between 1000pa for the 40@xmath0 m droplets and 120000pa for the 0.3@xmath0 m particles .",
    "the droplets may then be poorly deformable ( except for the 40@xmath0 m emulsion ) under shear , but they must be deformed due to confinement and to their high concentration .",
    "in particular they should have flat contacts which may allow the droplets to slip easily past each other ; this is a major difference with the suspensions of hard spheres in which any shear may push the particles towards the outer cylinder with an instantaneous long range effect on the particle concentration thanks to the force chains originating from direct frictional contact forces .",
    "note that consistency of our observations with the modelling of shear - induced migration based on normal stresses is difficult to check as normal stresses in dense emulsions are poorly known .",
    "it should be noted however that the normal stresses due to surface tension should be of the order of the yield stress @xcite in dense emulsions , while normal stresses tend to diverge at the approach of the maximum packing fraction in dense suspensions of rigid particles ( this difference is linked to the deformability of the droplets leading to flat contacts as pointed out above ) .",
    "it is thus not unexpected from this point of view that the kinetics of shear induced migration in a couette flow , which depends on the spatial variation of the first normal stress difference and of the radial normal stress @xcite , is very fast near the maximum packing fraction in suspensions of hard spheres while it would have to remain slow in dense emulsions .",
    "anyway , it is not possible to be more quantitative at this stage and to state if migration would have been expected to occur within this picture in our experimental conditions .      in these experiments , after a 5 min preshear at 100 rpm , we measured the velocity profiles at various rotational velocities . in all systems ,",
    "the stationary velocity profiles were found to develop within a few seconds and to remain stable for hours .",

    ", this contrasts with the long time evolution of the velocity profiles observed by @xcite ; we will comment on this point below .",
    "the stability of the velocity profiles is also consistent with the absence of shear - induced droplet migration in all systems : as the behavior of dense emulsions depends on their concentration , changes in the concentration profiles in time would have led to changes in the velocity profiles in time .",

    "the local measurements obtained for the 0.3@xmath0 m adhesive emulsion are compared in fig.[fig_emul_local1]a with the law inferred from the purely macroscopic measurements ( see sec.[section_torque ] ) .",
    "we observe that both laws are very well matched .",
    "in particular , the macroscopic measurements also allow us to evidence the slope break in the constitutive law at low shear rate .",
    "this validate the use of a wide gap couette geometry as a tool to obtain the constitutive law of dense emulsions from purely macroscopic rheometrical measurements , provided that a proper analysis of the macroscopic data is performed .",
    "we recall that this agreement is due to four important features ( i ) we have shown that all dense emulsions seem to be free from migration and thus remain homogeneous during the experiments , ( ii ) the use of a wide gap prevents from the nonlocal effects observed by @xcite , ( iii ) the material is initially destructured and a steady state is studied ( this may have not be the case in the @xcite study ) , ( iv ) wall slip has to be negligible to allow for a proper analysis of the macroscopic data : this is ensured here by the use of rough walls of roughness larger than the droplet size , as shown below .      as pointed out in sec .",
    "[ section_velocity ] , our velocity measurement method does not provide the velocity at the walls : the first reliable data is obtained at around 0.5 to 1 mm from the inner cylinder . however , the local measurements of the constitutive law we have performed make it possible to study in more detail a possible wall slip effect . for a given rotational velocity of the inner cylinder ,",
    "the velocity of the emulsion expected at the walls can actually be computed thanks to the knowledge of the shear rate in the emulsion corresponding to the shear stress value at the wall .",
    "the same shear stress level was actually reached somewhere in the bulk of the material for a higher rotational velocity of the inner cylinder , and the shear rate corresponding to this shear stress was then measured locally thanks to the velocity profile measurement .",
    "the velocity profile expected in the zone near the inner cylinder can then be reconstructed from the velocity profile measured at some distance from the walls and from the expected shear rate near the wall .",
    "of course , this analysis is based on the hypothesis that the material is the same as in the bulk in this 0.5 to 1 mm zone near the walls , which may be no more true in a zone where there are nonlocal effects @xcite .",
    "note also that this method can be used only when the reproducibility of the experiments is very good ( allowing data measured at a given rotational velocity to be used to predict what happens at another velocity ) .",

    "[ fig_emul_velocity2_slippage]b that the dimensionless velocity profiles expected near the walls have a value that is very close to 1 .",
    "this analysis was performed on several velocity profiles , and in all cases the dimensionless velocity values predicted at the inner cylinder were found to be equal to 1 within 1% .",
    "we finally conclude that , thanks to the use of rough surfaces of roughness larger than the droplet size , there is probably no wall slip in our experiments ; if any , it is of order 1% or less .",
    "this feature shows that the macroscopic measurements performed with a wide gap couette rheometer with rough walls can be trusted : this explains the very good agreement observed in fig .",

    "in contrast with dense suspensions of rigid particles where very fast migration occurs under shear , we showed for the first time that no migration takes place in dense emulsions even for strain as large as 100000 in our systems .",
    "this may imply that another mechanism is involved in dense emulsions than in dense suspensions .",
    "the homogeneity of our materials under shear allows to infer their constitutive law from purely macroscopic measurements .",
    "this constitutive law is consistent with the one inferred from the velocity profiles .",
    "this contrasts with previous results obtained by @xcite within a microchannel where nonlocal finite size effects are likely to have prevented from obtaining a constitutive law .",
