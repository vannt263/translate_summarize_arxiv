    "the study of randomness started with poincar , but it took almost @xmath3 years for digital electronics to make enough computational resources available so that the investigation on the transition from order to randomness could lead to the fascinating issue of deterministic chaos .",
    "one hallmark of chaotic systems is the presence of recognizable patterns in their state space .",
    "pattern - formation plays a fundamental role in the definition of i ) _ structural complexity _ by crutchfield @xcite and ii ) a number of other complexity measures , such as the so - called statistical complexity ( scm ) , relevant for this paper . for an excellent review on complexity measures",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the scm , based on the notion of _ disequilibrium _ in statistical space , was proposed by lpez ruiz , mancini and calbet @xcite and improved upon later in several papers @xcite .",
    "the scm version employed here was advanced in @xcite . in a related vein , the importance of using a  _ causal _ \" probability distribution function ( pdf ) to analyze the stochasticity - degree of chaotic and pseudo stochastic systems",
    "was emphasized in @xcite and @xcite .    in this field of endeavor",
    "it is of importance to study just how the sampling period @xmath0-influences the final results given that digital instrumentation is widely used in concomitant experiments .",
    "the most common sampling criterion is given by the sampling theorem by nyquist and shannon @xcite .",
    "it stipulates that the _ exact reconstruction _ of a continuous signal is possible whenever its fourier spectrum vanishes for frequencies above a certain @xmath4 ( the bandwidth ) .",
    "an _ infinite _ number of regularly sampled values is required and @xmath0 must satisfy the inequality @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the nyquist - shannon minimum sampling interval . the exact original continuous signal is recovered from the time series by using an _ ideal low pass filter_. note that in actual scenarios the number @xmath7 of samples is always finite and an exact reconstruction is not possible .    in a different vein , takens @xcite demonstrated that chaotic attractors generated by dynamical systems may be _ reconstructed _ if one has access to the _ infinite _ time series of regularly sampled values for just one state variable .",
    "takens procedure allows one to obtain the main parameters characterizing the chaotic system , like lyapunov exponents , dimensions , etc . for an impressive web - site containing very useful routines for nonlinear time series analysis see @xcite .",
    "the ensuing reconstruction procedure uses  delayed - samples \" with @xmath8 as the delay time , to generate a @xmath9-dimensional vector ( in a @xmath9-dimensional embedding space ) .",
    "note that the time delay @xmath8 must be a multiple of the sampling period @xmath0 , since we only possess data gathered at those times .",
    "let us remark that in the context of takens theorem the vocable _ reconstruction _ adopts a different meaning than that assigned by the nyquist - shannon theorem .",
    "in this paper we differentiate between a _ takens reconstruction _ and a _ nyquist reconstruction_. _ we will carefully look at just how the representative point of a chaotic attractor in an entropy - complexity plane ( @xmath10 ) changes with the sampling period_. it will be shown that when the _ causal pdf _ prescribed by the bandt and pompe procedure @xcite is used , the ensuing complexity @xmath11 exhibits a maximum for a given sampling period @xmath12 .",
    "however , such maximum does not appear if the conventional histogram - approach is used instead in assigning a pdf to the time series and thus a @xmath13 is used .",
    "we call the later histogram - distribution a _ non - causal pdf_. in point of fact , that of causality constitutes a difficult topic ( see for instance @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "a _ causal pdf _ is one that takes into account the temporal correlation between successive samples , which entails using a pdf with a symbol assigned to each trajectory s piece of length @xmath14 .",
    "it is of interest , for both the takens and the nyquist - shannon reconstruction processes , to analyze the relation between _",
    "i ) _ @xmath1 and _ ii ) _ other related temporal quantities proposed in the literature such as @xmath8 or @xmath6 .",
    "this is one of the topics to be here investigated . in the case of takens reconstruction",
    "it is well known that for a finite number of samples @xmath7 the quality of the reconstruction requires the selection of an adequate value for @xmath8 .",
    "there exist in the literature several different recommendations for a  good \" @xmath15 , like the first zero of the autocorrelation function , the first minimum of the mutual information function , etc . @xcite . for an interesting discussion",
    "see @xcite . in the case of nyquist s reconstruction , a bandwidth criterium",
    "must be chosen in order to evaluate the nyquist - shannon time @xmath16 ( because the spectrum of chaotic systems is not band - limited ) .    in section [ sec : takens ] we review the takens embedding theorem and the delay embedding reconstruction process .",
    "section [ sec : nyquist ] deals with the nyquist - shannon reconstruction process . in section",
    "[ sec : cbp ] the specific scm used in the paper is reviewed .",
    "results for three paradigmatic examples : _",
    "( a ) _ the lorenz chaotic attractor ; _ ( b ) _ the rssler chaotic attractor and _ ( c ) _ the chaotic attractor named @xmath17 by chlouverakis and sprott @xcite are reported in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "the first two attractors have been extensively studied in the literature but they both have a correlation dimension @xmath18 while the attractor @xmath17 has @xmath19 , covering almost all the @xmath20 state - space .",
    "conclusions and remarks are included in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the analysis performed here has been experimentally verified @xcite .",
    "let @xmath21 be an @xmath22-dimensional continuous dynamical system .",
    "a scalar measurement @xmath23 is a projection of the state @xmath24 onto an interval @xmath25 .",
    "the goal of all the embedding theorems proposed in the literature is to obtain a @xmath9-dimensional _ embedding space _",
    "@xmath26 in which @xmath27 can be reconstructed by using only @xmath28 .",
    "this _ reconstruction _ does not need to be exact , especially in the case of chaotic dissipative systems that usually have attractors with box counting dimension @xmath29 smaller than @xmath22 , the dimension of the state space . in this context , _ reconstruction _ merely indicates that @xmath30 shares with @xmath27 some characteristics .",
    "the main requirements a reconstructed space must fulfill are :    1 .   uniqueness of the dynamics in the reconstructed space .",
    "2 .   the reconstructed attractor must have dimensions , lyapunov exponents and entropies identical to those of the original attractor .",
    "consequently , the embedding of a compact smooth manifold @xmath31 into @xmath32 is defined to be a one - to - one @xmath33 map @xmath34 , with a jacobian @xmath35 which has full rank everywhere .",
    "let us assume that an infinite length - time scalar series @xmath36 is obtained by measuring one component of the @xmath22-dimensional vector field at evenly spaced times @xmath37 , with @xmath0 the sampling period .",
    "a time - delayed vector field is constructed as follows : @xmath38    takens proved @xcite that time - delay maps of dimension @xmath39 have the generic property of being the embedding of a compact manifold with dimension @xmath9 , if : ( 1 ) the measurement function @xmath40 is @xmath41 and ( 2 ) either the dynamics or the measurement couples all degrees of freedom . in the original version by takens , @xmath9 is the integer dimension of a smooth manifold , the phase space containing the attractor",
    ". thus @xmath9 can be much larger than the attractor dimension .",
    "_ @xcite were able to generalize the theorem into what they call the fractal delay embedding prevalence theorem .",
    "let @xmath29 be now the box counting dimension of the ( fractal ) attractor .",
    "then , for almost every smooth measurement function @xmath42 and any sampling time @xmath43 , the delay map into @xmath32 with @xmath44 is an embedding if : ( 1 ) there are no periodic orbits of the system with period @xmath0 or @xmath45 and ( 2 ) there only exists a finite number of periodic orbits with period @xmath46 , with @xmath47 .",
    "thus the main result of the embedding theorems is that it is not the dimension @xmath22 of the underlying state space what is important for ascertaining the minimal dimension of the embedding space , but only the fractal dimension @xmath29 of the support of the invariant measure generated by the dynamics in the state space . in dissipative systems @xmath29",
    "can be much smaller than @xmath22 .",
    "let us further remark that in favorable cases an attractor might be reconstructed in spaces of dimension @xmath9 such that @xmath48 .",
    "for example , for the determination of the correlation dimension , events of measure zero can be neglected ; thus any embedding with a dimension larger that @xmath29 is sufficient .    from a mathematical point of view , and for an _ infinite _ number of data items ( known with infinite precision as assumed in embedding theorems ) , the time - delay @xmath8 is an arbitrary multiple of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , there exists no rigorous way of determining @xmath8 s optimal value .",
    "but in a real scenario with a _ finite number _ @xmath49 of data items , the specific value adopted by the time delay is quite important .",
    "moreover , it is even unclear what properties the optimal value should have for best estimating a continuous system s specific property .",
    "many different methods have been suggested to estimate the time - delay @xcite . in the case of takens reconstruction procedure",
    "it is possible to use a time delay @xmath50 as pointed out above .",
    "since in this paper the sample period @xmath0 will be movable we will consider that both times are equal ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the analysis of _",
    "( i ) _ linear autocorrelations and _ ( ii ) _ average mutual information for a time series are two of the criteria often used in the literature to determine the best @xmath8-region .",
    "several characteristic times have been recommended using these two types of analysis .",
    "let us recapitulate .    1 .   _ time - delays induced by the discrete linear autocorrelation function .",
    "_ let @xmath52 be the measured component of the vector field ( the time series ) .",

    "+ four characteristic time delays are considered here : 1 .",
    "the first zero crossing of @xmath53 ( if it exists ) .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath56 be , respectively , the sampling period and the first zero crossing of @xmath53 .",
    "the characteristic time is @xmath57 .",
    "the first zero crossing of @xmath58 gives the first minimum of @xmath59 .",
    "we call this characteristic time @xmath60 .",
    "the first zero crossing of @xmath61 yields the first curvature - change of @xmath59 .",
    "we call this characteristic time @xmath62 .",
    "4 .   let @xmath63 be the smallest @xmath64 making @xmath53 to decay to less than @xmath65 .",
    "the corresponding characteristic time is @xmath66 .",
    "+ 2 .   _ delay - time induced by the discrete mutual information function .",
    "_ let @xmath52 be the measured component of the vector field ( the time series ) .",
    "the discrete mutual information function is a vector @xmath67 , defined as : @xmath68 \\ .\\ ] ]    equation ( [ eq : infomutua ] ) is determined as follows : _ ( a ) _ the real interval @xmath69 $ ] covered by the time series is partitioned into @xmath70 subintervals , equal sized consecutive non overlapping subintervals ; _ ( b ) _",
    "@xmath71 is the probability to find a time series value , @xmath72 , in the @xmath73-th interval , and @xmath74 is the joint probability for simultaneously encountering a time series value , @xmath72 , in the @xmath73-th interval while the time series value found at the @xmath64-th posterior positions , @xmath75 , falls into the the @xmath76-th interval .",
    "this quantity can be quite easily computed , for sufficiently small sizes of the partition elements ( sufficiently high values of @xmath70 ) , and , provided the attractor dimension is @xmath77 , this expression has no systematic dependence on @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "there exist good arguments for asserting that , if the time - delayed mutual information exhibits a marked minimum for a certain value of the delay @xmath78 , then this is a good candidate for a  reasonable \" time delay . the corresponding characteristic time is given by @xmath79 .",
    "nevertheless when one finds that the minimum of the mutual information @xmath80 lies at considerably larger times than @xmath81 ( the decay of autocorrelation function ) , it is worth optimizing the time - lag inside this range @xcite .",
    "the well known nyquist - shannon sampling theorem @xcite is based on the fourier transform ( ft ) .",
    "it states that a function @xmath28 , @xmath82 $ ] , containing no frequencies higher than @xmath83 in its ft , is completely determined by giving its coordinates at an infinite series of points ( samples ) spaced @xmath84 apart .",
    "consider the case of chaotic signals that are not band - limited .",
    "a value of @xmath83 may be defined from the discrete ft as follows .",
    "let @xmath85 , be the discrete ft ( dft ) of @xmath86 defined by @xmath87 the power contained in the first @xmath64 frequency components of the dft s is given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 refers to complex conjugation while the index @xmath90 .",

    "the complexity measure constructed in this way is intensive , as many thermodynamic quantities @xcite .",
    "we stress the fact that the above scm is not a trivial function of the entropy because it depends on two different probabilities distributions , the one associated to the system under analysis , @xmath109 , and the uniform distribution , @xmath119 .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that for a given @xmath103 value , there exists a range of possible scm values @xcite .",
    "thus , it is clear that @xmath99 carries important additional information ( related to the correlational structure between the components of the physical system ) that is not contained in the entropic functional .",
    "a detailed analysis of the @xmath99-behavior demonstrates the existence of bounds to @xmath99 that we called @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "these bounds can be systematically evaluated by recourse to a careful geometric analysis performed in the space of probabilities @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath120 and @xmath121 depend only on the probability space s dimension and , of course , on the functional form adopted by the amount of disorder @xmath103 and the disequilibrium @xmath123 .",

    "the bounds also provide us with relevant information that depends on the system s particular characteristics , as for instance , the existence of global extrema , or the peculiarities of the system s configuration as pointed out above , the pdf @xmath109 itself is not a uniquely defined object and several approaches have been employed in the literature to  associate \" @xmath109 to a given time series .",
    "just to mention some frequently used @xmath124extraction ( from the time series ) procedures , one has : _ a ) _ frequency counting @xcite , _ b ) _ time series histograms @xcite , _ c ) _ binary symbolic - dynamics @xcite , _ d ) _ fourier analysis @xcite , _ e ) _ wavelet transforms @xcite , _ f ) _ partition entropies @xcite , _",

    "there is ample liberty to choose among them and the specific application must be carefully analyzed so as to make a good choice .",
    "@xcite showed that the last mentioned methodology may be profitably used in the plane @xmath10 so as to separate and differentiate amongst stochastic , chaotic , and deterministic systems .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that temporal correlations are nicely displayed by the bandt and pompe pdf .",
    "summing up , different _ symbolic sequences _ may be assigned to a given time series .",
    "if one symbol @xmath125 of the finite alphabet @xmath26 is assigned to each @xmath126 of the time series , the _ symbolic sequence _ can be regarded as a _ non causal coarse grained _ description of the time series because the resulting pdf will not have any _ causal information_. the usual histogram - technique corresponds to this kind of assignment . for extracting @xmath109 via an histogram one",

    "note that @xmath7 in equations ( [ eq : smax ] ) and ( [ eq : q0j ] ) is equal to @xmath129 .",
    "of course , in this approach the temporal order of the time - series plays no role at all .",
    "the quantifiers obtained via the ensuing pdf - histogram are called in this paper , respectively , @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "let us also point out that for time series with a finite alphabet it is relevant to consider a judiciously chosen optimal value for @xmath129 ( see e.g. de micco _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "_ causal information _ may be duly incorporated into the construction - process that yields @xmath109 if one symbol of a finite alphabet @xmath26 is assigned to a trajectory s portion , i.e. , we assign  words \" to each trajectory - portion",
    ". the bandt and pompe methodology for extraction of the pdf corresponds to this type of assignment and the resulting probability distribution @xmath109 is thus a _ causal coarse grained _ description of the system .",
    "note that , in the bandt and pompe approach a sort of _ coarse graining _ and _ word construction _ is effected ( for methodological detail see below ) .",
    "note that there are other ways to get a causal pdf .",
    "the advantage of the bandt and pompe approach lies in the fact that it solves the problem of finding generation partitions .",
    "thus one expect that for increasing patterns length ( embedding dimension ) the bandt and pompe approach retains all relevant essentials of the original continuous ( in space ) dynamics .",
    "the quantifiers obtained by appeal to this pdf are denoted in this paper as @xmath134 and @xmath135 , respectively .",
    "a notable bandt and pompe result consists in yielding a clear improvement on the quality of information theory - based quantifiers @xcite .    in summarizing now the approach , note that bandt and pompe @xcite introduced a simple and robust method to evaluate the probability distribution taking into account the time causality of the system dynamics .",
    "they suggested that the symbol sequence should arise naturally from the time series , without any model - based assumptions .",
    "thus , they took partitions by comparing the order of neighboring values rather than partitioning the amplitude into different levels .",
    "that is , given a time series @xmath136 , an embedding dimension @xmath137 , and an embedding delay @xmath138 , the ordinal pattern of order @xmath9 generated by @xmath139 is to be considered .",
    "to each time @xmath42 we assign a @xmath9-dimensional vector that results from the evaluation of the time series at times @xmath140 .",
    "clearly , the higher the value of @xmath9 , the more information about the past is incorporated into the ensuing vectors . by the ordinal pattern of order @xmath9 related to the time @xmath42 we mean the permutation @xmath141 of @xmath142 defined by @xmath143 in this way the vector defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : vectores ] ) is converted into a unique symbol @xmath144 . in order to get a unique result we consider that @xmath145 if @xmath146 .",
    "this is justified if the values of @xmath147 have a continuous distribution so that equal values are very unusual .",
    "for all the @xmath148 possible orderings ( permutations ) @xmath149 when the embedding dimension is @xmath9 , their associated relative frequencies can be naturally computed by the number of times this particular order sequence is found in the time series divided by the total number of sequences , @xmath150 in the last expression the symbol @xmath151 stands for  number\".thus , an ordinal pattern probability distribution @xmath152 is obtained from the time series .",
    "it is clear that this ordinal time - series analysis entails losing some details of the original amplitude - information .",
    "nevertheless , a meaningful reduction of the complex systems to their basic intrinsic structure is provided .",
    "symbolizing time series , on the basis of a comparison of consecutive points allows for an accurate empirical reconstruction of the underlying phase - space of chaotic time - series affected by weak ( observational and dynamical ) noise @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the ordinal - pattern probability distribution is invariant with respect to nonlinear monotonous transformations .",
    "thus , nonlinear drifts or scalings artificially introduced by a measurement device do not modify the quantifiers estimations , a relevant property for the analysis of experimental data .",
    "these advantages make the bp approach more convenient than conventional methods based on range partitioning .",
    "additional advantages of the bandt and pompe method reside in its simplicity ( we need few parameters : the pattern length / embedding dimension @xmath9 and the embedding time lag @xmath153 ) and the extremely fast nature of the pertinent calculation - process @xcite .",
    "we stress that the bandt and pompe s methodology is not restricted to time series representative of low dimensional dynamical systems but can be applied to any type of time series ( regular , chaotic , noisy , or reality based ) , with a very weak stationary assumption ( for @xmath154 , the probability for @xmath155 should not depend on @xmath156 @xcite ) .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath109 is obtained once we fix the embedding dimension @xmath9 and the embedding delay @xmath153 .",
    "the former parameter plays an important role for the evaluation of the appropriate probability distribution , since @xmath9 determines the number of accessible states , given by @xmath148 .",

    "this is what we do here ( in the present work @xmath160 and @xmath161 are used ) .",
    "of course it is also assumed that enough data are available for a correct attractor - reconstruction .",
    "the time - causal nature of the bandt and pompe pdf allows for its success in separating chaotic from stochastic systems in different regions of the plane @xmath162 @xcite .",
    "the main properties of the statistical complexity to be here employed are : _",
    "( i ) _ it is able to grasp essential details of the dynamics , because it employs a causal pdf , _ ( ii ) _ it is an intensive quantity ( in the thermodynamical sense ) and , _ ( iii ) _ it is capable of discerning both among different degrees of periodicity and of chaos @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath134 ( the normalized shannon permutation entropy ) and @xmath135 ( the permutation statistical complexity measure ) , like other information theory measures ( i.e. relative entropy , mutual information , etc . )",
    "are not system - invariant as fractal dimensions or lyapunov exponents are .",
    "however , these quantifiers provide important and valuable information on the dynamical system under analysis . for example",
    ", @xmath134 can be consider a good approximation to the kolmogorov - sinai entropy @xcite , a system invariant quantity .",

    "the entropy - complexity plane @xmath162 is quite useful for distinguishing between stochastic noise and deterministic chaotic behavior was recently illustrated in @xcite .",
    "in such a vein we first analyze the planar evolution of representative points for our systems as the sampling frequency changes ( see fig . [ fig : ch].a - c for the three sampled variables of the rossler system , fig .",

    "the reason for such behavior is , as we comment in sec .",
    "[ sec : takens ] , that for a very big sampling period the dynamical correlations between consecutive measures are lost due to the mixing behavior of the chaotic system under study .",
    "that is , the measures can be completely uncorrelated and present characteristics like random behavior ( @xmath201 and @xmath202 ) .",
    "on the contrary , for very small sampling periods @xmath0 the measures will be ( strongly ) time - correlated so that successive measures suggest being in the presence of a very ordered system ( @xmath203 and @xmath204 ) .",
    "the evolution of the system in the @xmath162 plane for regimes intermediate between these two extreme sampling - period instances will depend on the specific characteristics of the nonlinear system under study : whether it presents mixing or not ; its chaos - degree , etc .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that non linear correlations are the origin of the geometric structures that constitute the hallmark of deterministic chaos @xcite .",
    "precisely , in previous works @xmath135 was seen to be a measure of the complexity induced by these non linear correlations .",
    "our present results tell us that @xmath205  the sampling frequency corresponding to the point with maximum complexity  can be regarded as the _ optimum sampling frequency _ , i.e , the minimum sampling frequency that retains all the information concerning these structures .",
    "higher sampling frequencies imply an _ oversampling _ , producing unnecessary long files to cover the full attractor , while lower sampling frequencies make the time series to lose some vital information concerning nonlinear correlations . in the oversampled case ,",
    "specific @xmath9-length ordinal patterns @xmath206 and @xmath207 appear more frequently than any other ordinal pattern , causing a low entropy @xmath134 and a low complexity @xmath135 .",
    "points in the region with high entropy and low complexity of the @xmath162 plane correspond to _ undersampled trajectories _ of the continuous system .",
    "the samples are not correlated at all and the system behaves randomly .",
    "consequently , all the ordinal patterns appear with almost the same frequency , as the ensuing high entropies @xmath134 and low complexities @xmath135 reveal .",
    "the evolution of the representative point in the plane @xmath162 near the top limiting curve is typical of chaotic systems , as demonstrated by the authors of @xcite .",
    "let us stress the importance of using the bandt and pompe procedure to obtain the all - important pdf .",
    "a well - known result is that any chaotic map shares with its iterated maps the same histogram @xcite .",
    "this property is the basis of the _ skipping randomizing technique _ @xcite .",
    "for that reason de micco _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed the use of two different pdfs , as relevant for testing _",
    "( i ) _ the uniformity of @xmath208 ( the invariant measure ) and _ ( ii ) _ the mixing constant @xmath209 pertaining to a chaotic time series , as a means to generate pseudo random numbers .",
    "they proceeded to employ _ ( a ) _ a pdf @xmath210 based on time series histograms and _ ( b ) _ another pdf @xmath211 based on ordinal patterns ( permutation ordering ) that derives from appealing to the already cited bandt and pompe method @xcite .",
    "one may conjecture that continuous systems exhibit an analogous property , viz . , the sampling process does not significantly change the histogram of the time series and , consequently",
    ", any quantifier based on the pdf histogram is not sensitive to the sampling frequency .",
    "such conjecture is validated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bpvshist ] , where the statistical complexities @xmath135 and @xmath133 are depicted as functions of the sampling frequency for the @xmath178-coordinates of the three systems ( see fig . [",
    "fig : bpvshist].a for rossler s instance , fig .",
    "[ fig : bpvshist].b for lorenz case , and fig .",
    "[ fig : bpvshist].c for @xmath17 ) .",
    "a similar result is obtained if @xmath135 and @xmath133 are evaluated for the other coordinates @xmath180 and @xmath179 , and also if mean values @xmath212/3 $ ] and @xmath213/3 $ ] are used .",
    "consequently , we conclude that the usual histogram technique is not useful to analyze the effects of the sampling frequency and that a causal pdf ( here the bandt and pompe one ) _ must _ be employed instead .",
    "note that in figs .",
    "[ fig : ch ] and [ fig : bpvshist ] many irregularities of the trajectories become visible .",
    "these are produced by the nontrivial relation between @xmath135 and @xmath134 , and diminish as the number of realizations increases .",

    "the mean value of @xmath135 over coordinates @xmath178 , @xmath180 , and @xmath179 also exhibits a maximum for the @xmath1 indicated in column @xmath219 ( @xmath220 ) .",

    "figures closer to unity in column @xmath221 ( within each class of characteristic times ) are emphasized by using bold - types .    as we mention in sec .",
    "[ sec : cbp ] , the normalized shannon entropy and statistical complexity evaluated with pdf - bandt and pompe are not system invariant ( neither are other quantifiers derived by information theory ) .",
    "the values of these quantifiers depend on how the pdf is evaluated .",
    "however , they provide very useful information about the dynamics of the system under study .",
    "it is clear then that @xmath134 and @xmath135 and the quantities derived from them could attain different values according with the specific time series considered ( i.e. time series generated by the different coordinates of the system or a combination of them ) even if it is reasonable to expect that their corresponding values do not exhibit a strong dispersion .",
    "this assumption is clearly confirmed if we look at the values obtained for @xmath1 in table [ tab : chartimes2 ] , evaluated for different times series . as expected , the same kind of behavior is obtained in the case of @xmath222 ( average mutual information ) .    from inspection of the results displayed in tab .",
    "[ tab : chartimes2 ] we see that the time @xmath1 yields similar values to those obtained from the evaluation of the average mutual information @xmath222 . the largest difference between @xmath1 and @xmath222 ( see column 8 in tab .",
    "[ tab : chartimes2 ] ) is observed for the @xmath17 system .",
    "such disparity can be attributed to the fact that this system possesses an attractor with @xmath223 ( that covers most of the state - space ) in contrast with the other two systems considered here , the lorenz and rossler ones , which have @xmath224 @xcite .",
    "with regards to @xmath1 and the others special characteristic times ( for our three dynamical systems ) we can state that , in the rossler - case , such characteristic times are , respectively , the first minimum of the mutual information @xmath225 , the first zero of the autocorrelation @xmath226 , and @xmath6 , for @xmath227 . in the the lorenz - instance",
    "the characteristic times closest to @xmath1 are : the first minimum of the mutual information @xmath225 , the first change of curvature of the autocorrelation @xmath228 , and @xmath6 for @xmath229 .",
    "finally , for @xmath17 the characteristic times closest to @xmath1 are : @xmath81 , and @xmath6 for @xmath227 .",
    "the first minimum of the mutual information appears far from the @xmath230location .",
    "the shape of @xmath231 ( discrete mutual information ) is very irregular , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : im].c , which explains why such features takes place .",
    "for all the systems , the nyquist criterion provides smaller characteristic times if @xmath232 is used instead , illustrating thus on the difference between the _ exact reconstruction _ that is the goal of the nyquist - shannon theorem and the _ approximate attractor reconstruction _ that relies on takens theorem .",
    "note that the autocorrelation function is based just on linear statistics and does not contain any information concerning nonlinear dynamical correlations .",
    "kantz and schreiber @xcite stressed the drawback of using linear statistics for the lorenz system , with a typical trajectory staying some time on one wing of the butterfly attractor and spiralling then from the inside to the border before jumping to the other wing .",
    "the autocorrelation does not reveal the importance of the period of such  jumping \" between wings , but the mutual information does so .",
    "also , the autocorrelation of the squared signal is able to detect this periodic change @xcite .    to assess the quality of the takens reconstruction process using @xmath1 , @xmath181 is evaluated for an embedding dimension ranging from @xmath233 to @xmath193 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : d2a9 ] ) .",
    "the pertinent estimation of @xmath181 is compared with values reported in the literature for the continuous system @xcite .",
    "the subroutine _",
    "d2 _ of the tisean package @xcite was used for calculating @xmath181 .",
    "let us stress that the estimation of @xmath181 poses a very delicate problem , so that we refer the readers to the documentation available for the tisean package and also to the excellent book by kantz and schreiber @xcite . figs . [ fig : d2a9 ] show that @xmath12 produces a time series with a @xmath181 that turns out to be a better estimation for the correlation dimension of the continuous system than those obtained with higher ( under - sampled ) or lower ( over - sampled ) values for @xmath0 .",
    "similar results were obtained when we consider the evaluation of the maximum lyapunov exponent .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the time @xmath1 , for which one detects a maximum in the entropy - complexity plane @xmath234 , is unique for the three dynamical systems analyzed in the present work .",
    "we associate this sample - time with the one needed to capture all the relevant information related to the dynamics nonlinear correlations . recently",
    "soriano _ et al . _",
    "@xcite theoretically and experimentally studied a chaotic semiconductor laser with optical feedback .",
    "this is an extremely interesting system because dynamical systems with time delay , like the mackey - glass or a laser with delay feedback , exhibit different relevant time scales @xcite .",
    "consequently , additional complexity - maxima could be expected ( in addition to the one encountered in dealing with the chaotic systems of this paper ) . in the case of the laser",
    "studied in @xcite the main time scales are : i ) @xmath235 , the feedback - time providing the largest time scale , ii ) @xmath236 , that is the relaxation oscillation providing a shorter time scale , and finally iii ) chaotic oscillations , that govern the fastest time scale .",
    "experimentally confirmed that our prescription for @xmath1 corresponds to a maximum of @xmath135 , as found in all the chaotic systems studied in this paper ( see fig .",
    "10 in @xcite ) . to our knowledge , this is the first controlled experiment where our prescription has been to hold .",
    "sharing the point of view of abarbanel @xcite , our prescription for the sample period @xmath12 is based on the consideration of a fundamental aspect of chaos , namely , the generation of information . thus , our choice is made by taking into account an important property of the system we wish to describe .",
    "remark that stable linear systems generate zero information . in consequence ,",
    "information - generation @xcite is a property of nonlinear dynamics not shared by linear evolutions .",
    "finally , another issue to be aware of is the influence of noise . to verify the robustness of the criterion here advanced",
    ", gaussian noise was added to each system and the value of @xmath1 was obtained as a function of the signal to noise @xmath237 ratio ( @xmath238 ) of this gaussian noise . in all cases ,",
    "the value of @xmath1 remained constant ( up to three significant decimal digits ) for @xmath239 .",
    "if the noise - strength is higher , @xmath1 suddenly decreases as the representative point in the plane @xmath240 moves to the rightwards region ( stochastic region ) , where ordering - patterns are strongly affected by noise .",
    "our main goal here was to show that a particular version of the statistical complexity measure @xmath135 , evaluated by recourse to the probability distribution obtained via the bandt and pompe procedure , allows one to determine , under the light of a takens reconstruction procedure , convenient sampling periods .",
    "this is done so as to get time series useful for investigating chaotic behavior .",
    "this sampling - period was called @xmath1 , and the procedure was illustrated via a detailed consideration of three paradigmatic systems . on the basis of these significant examples we conjecture that our optimality criterion may be of general application for chaotic systems , since @xmath135 is a measure of the geometric structures produced by nonlinear correlations , always present in this class of dynamical systems .",
    "we showed that @xmath1 is compatible with those specific times recommended in the literature as adequate delay - ones in takens reconstruction .",
    "our results closely approach the exact nyquist - shannon reconstruction .",
    "this is so because high frequencies of the fourier spectrum are due to chaotic oscillations , and this is the case for the systems studied here . to our knowledge ,",
    "controlled experiments for different sampling times of the measured variables and large numbers of data have not yet been reported in the literature and the highest sampling frequency allowed by the digital acquisition system is the one usually adopted ( as an exception see @xcite ) . in the light of our present results",
    "it would be better , in practice , to assess the correct @xmath230value for a clever choosing of the sampling period .",
    "this permits one to cover the whole attractor - basin and retain in the reconstruction process the most important properties of chaotic systems . in view of the extensive use of digital acquisition systems in all kinds of experiments , we hope that experimentalists may consider the present contribution as a practical tool in their activities and may thus be able to validate our proposal .",
