    "in the theoretical treatment of the properties of nuclear matter , the relativistic phenomenological approach developed by walecka  @xcite , the so - called quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd - i ) , represents one of the important approaches to the highly nonlinear behavior of strong interactions at the hadronic energy scales . this model provides a thermodynamically consistent theoretical framework for the description of bulk static properties of strong interacting many - body nuclear systems @xcite .",

    "the model has been largely used in calculations of nuclear matter and finite nuclei ( see , e.g. , @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "an important aspect worth emphasizing concerning the walecka treatment is that it is based on standard quantum statistical relations , i.e. , fermi - dirac distributions . on the other hand , as is well known , some restrictions to the applicability of the standard statistical mechanics have motivated investigations of power - law or non - gaussian statistics , both from theoretical and experimental viewpoints . in this concern ,",
    "the tsallis nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite and the extensive generalized power - law statistics developed by kaniadakis  @xcite are the most investigated frameworks .",
    "several consequences ( in different branches ) of the former framework have been investigated in the literature @xcite , which includes systems of interest in high energy physics , namely , the problem of solar neutrino @xcite , the charm quark dynamics in a thermal quark - gluon plasma for the case of collisional equilibration @xcite , interpretations for central au - au collisions at rhic energies in a relativistic diffusion model ( rdm ) @xcite , among others ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "several physical features of the @xmath0-distribution have also been theoretically investigated as , for instance , the self - consistent relativistic statistical theory @xcite , nonlinear kinetics @xcite , and the h - theorem from a generalization of the chaos molecular hypothesis @xcite .    in this paper , by following our previous results  @xcite , we adopt the kaniadakis non - gaussian statistics and study the effects of the @xmath0-generalization for the fermi - dirac ( fd ) distributions on the qhd - i theory , especially what concerns its effects on the equation of state ( eos ) of the nuclear matter .",

    "we believe that it may have consequencies in astrophysical studies , mainly in what concerns the calculation of masses of compact objects , such as protoneutron stars .",
    "another interesting feature of the @xmath0-qhd - i is that , at temperatures in the range @xmath96 , phase transitions of first order can be avoided by a convenient variation of the parameter @xmath0 , which allows the determination of a critical @xmath76 parameter at the turning point of an isotherm at a given @xmath63 .    in the second case",
