    "in recent years a significant effort has been devoted to the understanding of glass - forming systems .",
    "recent theoretical and numerical results clearly show that the slowing down of the dynamics near the glass transition is strongly connected to the potential energy landscape geometry .",
    "the trajectory of the representative point in the configuration space can be viewed as a path in a multidimensional potential energy surface @xcite .",
    "the dynamics is therefore strongly influenced by the topography of the potential energy landscape : local minima , barriers heights , basins of attraction an other topological properties all influence the dynamics .",
    "the potential energy surface of a super - cooled liquid contains a large number of local minima , called _ inherent structures _ ( is ) by stillinger @xcite . all states that under local energy minimization will flow into",
    "the same is define the _ basin _ of the is ( valley ) . with this pictures in mind",
    "the time evolution of the system can be seen as the result of two different processes : thermal relaxation into basins ( _ intra - basin _ motion ) and thermally activated potential energy barrier crossing between different basins ( _ inter - basin _ motion ) . when the temperature is lowered down to the order of the critical mode coupling theory ( mct ) temperature @xmath1 the inter - basin motion slows down and the relaxation dynamics",
    "is dominated by the slow thermally activated crossing of potential energy barriers @xcite .",
    "if the temperature is further reduced the relaxation time eventually becomes of the same order of the observation time and the system falls out of equilibrium since there is not enough time to cross barriers and equilibrate .",
    "this define the `` experimental''glass transition temperature @xmath2 . the regime between @xmath1 and @xmath2 can not be described by the mct since it neglects activated processes responsible for barrier crossing . in mct",
    "the relaxation time diverges at @xmath1 , leading to @xmath3 , and the dynamics remains confined into a single basin forever .",
    "the essential features of mct for glass - forming systems are also common to the high temperature phase of some fully connected spin glass models @xcite , the most well known being the spherical @xmath0-spin spin glass model @xcite",
    ". we shall call these models _ mean - field @xmath0-spin - like _ glass models . as a consequence at the critical temperature @xmath1 , called @xmath4 in @xmath0-spin language",
    ", an ergodic to non - ergodic transition takes place .",
    "below this temperature the system is dynamically confined to a metastable state ( a basin ) @xcite since relaxation to true equilibrium can only take place via activated processes , absent in mean - field models .",
    "for these systems , nevertheless , it is known that the true equilibrium transition to a low temperature phase occurs below @xmath4 at the static critical temperature @xmath5 , also denoted by @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this is the analogous of the kauzmann temperature @xmath7 for liquids .",
    "the glass transition temperature @xmath2 of real systems sits somewhere in between @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "this transition , obviously , can not be reached even on infinite time in mean - field models .    despite these difficulties mean - field models , having the clear advantage of being analytically tractable ,",
    "have been largely used to study the properties of fragile glassy systems , especially between the dynamical temperature @xmath4 and the static temperature @xmath5 . the picture that emerges is however not complete since activated process can not be captured by mean - field models .",
    "therefore the relevance of mean - field results for real systems can not be considered completely stated .",
    "only recently activated processes in mean - field - like models have been invesigated in extended numerical investigation of _ finite - size _ fully - connected @xmath0-spin - like models @xcite . comparing the results with the observed behavior of super - cooled liquids near @xmath1",
    "we can conclude that , once activated process are allowed , mean - field @xmath0-spin - like models are highly valuable for a deep understanding of the glass transition in real systems .",
    "we report the main results obtained for the ising - spin random orthogonal model ( rom ) @xcite , defined by the hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath8 where @xmath9 are @xmath10 ising spin variables , and @xmath11 is a @xmath12 random symmetric orthogonal matrix with @xmath13 . for @xmath14",
    "this model has the same thermodynamic properties of the @xmath0-spin model : a dynamical transition at @xmath15 , with threshold energy per spin @xmath16 , and a static transition at @xmath17 , with critical energy per spin @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the free energy analysis ( tap ) @xcite reveals that the phase space is composed by an exponentially large ( in @xmath10 ) number of different basins , separated by infinitely large ( for @xmath14 ) barriers .",
    "each basin is unambiguously labelled by the value of the energy density @xmath19 of the local minimum contained within it , i.e. the is of the system . in this picture",
    "the dynamical transition is associated with is having the largest basin of attraction for @xmath14 , while the static transition with is with the lowest accessible free energy ( vanishing configurational entropy ) @xcite .    in the mean - field limit ,",
    "the allowed values of @xmath19 are between @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "solutions with @xmath19 larger than @xmath21 are unstable ( saddles ) , while solutions with @xmath19 smaller than @xmath20 have negligible statistical weight .",
    "moreover in the @xmath14 limit is with @xmath22 attract most ( exponentially in @xmath10 ) of the states and dominate the behavior of the system .",
    "other is are irrelevant for @xmath14 . for finite @xmath10",
    "the scenario is different since not only the basins of is with @xmath23 acquire statistical weight , but it may happen that solutions with @xmath24 and few negative directions ( saddles with few downhill directions ) become stable , simply because there are not enough degrees of freedom to hit them .    to get more insight the is - structure of finite systems we follow stillinger and weber @xcite and decompose the partition sum into a sum over basins of different is and a sum within each basin .",
    "collecting all is with the same energy @xmath19 , denoting with @xmath25\\,de$ ] the number of is with energy between @xmath19 and @xmath26 , and shifting the energy of each basin with that of the associated is , the partition sum can be rewritten as @xcite @xmath27\\ ] ] where @xmath28 can be seen as the free energy density of the system when confined in one of the basin associated with is of energy @xmath19 .",
    "the function @xmath29 is the _ configurational entropy density _ also called _",
    "complexity_. from the partition function we can compute the average internal energy density @xmath30 @xmath31 .",
    "the first term is the average energy of the is relevant for the thermodynamics at temperature @xmath32 , while the second is the contribution from fluctuations inside the associated basins . in the limit",
    "@xmath14 only is with @xmath22 contribute and @xmath33 for any @xmath34 . for finite @xmath10 , and @xmath32 not too close to @xmath4 ,",
    "the thermodynamics is dominated by is with @xmath24 and @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "this is more evident from the ( equilibrium ) probability distribution of @xmath19 since it is centered about @xmath36 indicating that is with @xmath37 have the largest basins .",
    "this scenario has been also observed in real glass - forming systems@xcite .    from the knowledge of is - energy distribution",
    "we can reconstruct the complexity @xmath29 since from eq .",
    "( [ eq : part ] ) the probability that an equilibrium configuration at temperature @xmath38 lies in a basin associated with is of energy between @xmath19 and @xmath26 is : @xmath39 / z_n(t ) .",
    "$ ] in the temperature range where this applies , the curves @xmath40 are equal , except for a temperature dependent factor @xmath41 , to @xmath42 . if the @xmath19-dependence of @xmath28 can be neglected , then it is possible to superimpose the curves for different temperatures , see fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] ( a ) .",
    "the data collapse is rather good for @xmath43 . above the curves",
    "can not be superimposed anymore indicating that the @xmath19-dependence of @xmath28 can not be neglected . in liquid",
    "this is called the anharmonic threshold @xcite .",
    "direct consequence of @xmath44 for @xmath45 is that in this range the partition function can be written as the product of an intra - basin contribution [ @xmath46 ) ] and of a configurational contribution which depends only on the is energy densities distribution .",
    "the system can then be considered as composed by two independent subsystems : the intra - basin subsystem describing the equilibrium when confined within basins , and the is subsystem describing equilibrium via activated processes between different basins .",
    "as the temperature is lowered and/or @xmath10 increased the two processes get more separated in time and the separation becomes more and more accurate . a scenario typical of super - cooled liquids near the mct transition @xcite .",
    "more informations on the is structure can be obtained from non - equilibrium relaxation processes . to study the non - equilibrium dynamics we quench at time zero the system from an initial equilibrium configuration at temperature @xmath47 to a final temperature @xmath48 and study the evolution of the average is energy per spin @xmath49 as function of time ,",
    "see fig.[fig : e - aging ] ( b ) .",
    "two different relaxation processes are clear seen . a first regime independent of @xmath50 , and a second regime independent of both @xmath51 and @xmath50 .",
    "the final temperature @xmath50 controls the cross - over between the two regimes .",
    "a similar behavior has been observed in molecular dynamics simulations of super - cooled liquids @xcite .",
    "the two regimes are associated with different relaxation processes . in the first part",
    "the system has enough energy and relaxation is mainly due to _ path search _ out of basins through saddles of energy lower than @xmath52 .",
    "this part depends only on the initial equilibrium temperature @xmath51 since it sets the initial phase space region .",
    "different @xmath51 leads to different power law .",
    "in particular relaxation must slow down as @xmath51 decreases since we expect that lower states are surrounded by higher barriers , in agreement with numerical data @xcite .    during this process",
    "the system explores deeper and deeper valleys ( basins ) while decreasing its energy .",
    "the process stops when all barrier heights become of @xmath53 . from now on the relaxation proceeds only via activated process .",
    "a first consequence is that lower the final temperature @xmath50 shorter the first relaxation , in agreement with our findings [ see figures [ fig : e - aging ] ] .",
    "the analysis of the distance between the instantaneous system state and the corresponding is , counting the number of single spin flip needed to reach the is , reveals that for all times the systems stays in configurations few spin flips away from an is .",
    "a similar study starting from equilibrium configurations at temperature @xmath54 evaluated comparing panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure [ fig : e - aging ] @xcite leads to similar numbers .",
    "we then conclude that during relaxation the aging system explores the same type of minima ( and basins ) visited in equilibrium at temperature @xmath55 .",
    "direct consequence is that once the system has reached the activated regime there can not be memory of the initial @xmath51 , and all curves with different @xmath51 but same @xmath50 should collapse for large time @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have shown that _",
    "finite - size _ mean - field @xmath0-spin - like models are good candidates for studying the glass transition .",
    "the key point is that near the glass transition the thermodynamics of the systems is dominated by the is distributions , therefore all systems with similar is distributions should have similar behavior .",
    "finite - size mean - field @xmath0-spin - like models have the double advantage of being analytically tractable for @xmath14 and easily simulated numerically for finite @xmath10 , offering good models to analyze the glass transition ."
