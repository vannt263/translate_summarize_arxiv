    "the first metrics one typically encounters in the study of general relativity are the minkowski spacetime metric and the schwarzschild spacetime metric , the latter given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the time coordinate , @xmath2 are spatial coordinates , and @xmath3 is some positive number .",
    "this represents the exterior region @xmath4 of a non - rotating black hole of mass @xmath3 in vacuum .",
    "a spacelike slice of this lorentzian metric can be obtained by taking a level set of @xmath1 ; under a coordinate transformation @xmath5 , the resulting 3-manifold is isometric to @xmath6 minus the ball of radius @xmath7 about the origin , with the conformally flat metric @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the usual flat metric on @xmath6 and @xmath10 .",
    "its boundary is in fact a minimal surface which represents the apparent horizon of the black hole .",
    "we will refer to this riemannian metric as the _ schwarzschild metric _ ( of mass @xmath3 ) .",
    "consider instead the metric @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "this gives a riemannian metric on @xmath6 minus a closed ball of radius @xmath13 about the origin that approaches zero near its inner boundary .",
    "one may loosely think of this manifold as a slice of a spacetime with a single `` black hole of negative mass . ''",
    "in fact , this metric has a naked singularity , as the singularity on the inner boundary is not enclosed by any apparent horizon . in this paper",
    "we introduce a theory of such `` zero area singularities '' ( zas ) , modeled on the `` schwarzschild zas metric '' ( i.e. , @xmath11 with @xmath12 ) , yet far more general .",
    "some of the interesting problems we address are :    when can such singularities be `` resolved '' ?    what is a good definition of the mass of such a singularity ?",
    "can the adm mass of an asymptotically flat manifold of nonnegative scalar curvature be estimated in terms of the masses of its singularities ?",
    "to say another word about the third question , recall the positive mass theorem of schoen and yau @xcite which states that , under suitable conditions , the adm mass of an asymptotically flat 3-manifold is nonnegative , with zero mass occurring only for the flat metric on @xmath6 .",
    "the riemannian penrose inequality @xcite improves this to give a lower bound on the adm mass in terms of the masses of its `` black holes . '' here , the case of equality is attained by the schwarzschild metric with @xmath14 .",
    "see appendix a for details on asymptotic flatness and adm mass .",
    "the main theorem of this paper is the riemannian zas inequality ( see theorems [ thm_zas_ineq ] and [ thm_zas_ineq_full ] ) , introduced by the first author @xcite .",
    "it is an analog of the riemannian penrose inequality , but for zero area singularities instead of black holes .",
    "specifically , this inequality gives a lower bound for the adm mass of an asymptotically flat manifold in terms of the masses of its zas .",
    "its proof assumes an unproven conjecture ( conjecture [ conj_conformal ] ) regarding the outermost minimal area enclosure of the boundary , with respect to a conformal metric . while the conjecture is known to be true in a number of cases , proving it remains an open problem .",
    "although we shall write `` the ''",
    "riemannian zas inequality in this paper , we remark that other similar inequalities may be discovered in the future that also deserve this title .",

    "we now determine the mass of @xmath19 assuming @xmath20 .",
    "the first step is to compute the regular masses of the concentric spheres @xmath21 : @xmath22 we can use lhopital s rule to evaluate this limit ( of the form @xmath23 ) as @xmath24 : @xmath25 this limit is @xmath26 if @xmath27 , finite but nonzero if @xmath28 , and zero if @xmath29 . for @xmath29 , this shows that the mass of @xmath19 is zero .",

    "let @xmath33 be the minimum value of the @xmath34-coordinate that @xmath35 attains ; then @xmath35 encloses @xmath36 , so @xmath37 . also , since @xmath35 converges in @xmath32 , the ratio of areas @xmath38 converges to 1 .",
    "using the proof of theorem [ thm_pos_cap ] , we can estimate the regular mass of @xmath35 : @xmath39 where the last equality comes from equations @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",

    "is a point deleted from the interior of a smooth riemannian manifold .",
    "such singularities can be viewed as zas .",

    "( the key tool is the existence of a harmonic function that blows up at the removable singularities . ) however , not all zas with zero mass are removable , as seen in earlier examples .",
    "there is also a notion of a `` removable @xmath76 singularity '' ; this occurs when an embedded circle is removed from the interior of a smooth riemannian manifold .",
    "the resulting space has a zero area singularity that is topologically a 2-torus .",
    "it is left to the reader to verify that removable @xmath76 singularities have mass equal to @xmath26 ( at least for a circle deleted from @xmath6 ) .",
    "thus , our definition of mass is not well - adapted to studying these types of singularities .      in this section ,",
    "we prove by example that there exists a zas that has a local resolution but no local harmonic resolution ; we begin by showing that the problem of finding a local harmonic resolution is equivalent to solving a linear elliptic pde .",

    "then @xmath52 is a local resolution of the zas of @xmath100 .",
    "we assume that if a local harmonic resolution exists , it is also spherically symmetric . by equation @xmath101 , the laplacian on functions of @xmath34 is given by @xmath102 thus , for our choice of @xmath103 , we have @xmath104 , so equation @xmath93 becomes @xmath105 where @xmath88 is the quotient of @xmath53 and the unknown harmonic resolution function .",
