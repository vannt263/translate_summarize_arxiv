    "<S> it is very interesting to perform the self - consistent calculations for @xmath0 hypernuclei in the qmf model without any freedom of adjusting parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> we start with the description of the @xmath0 hyperon in nuclear medium . </S>",
    "<S> the nucleon and the @xmath0 hyperon as composites of three quarks are described in terms of the constituent quark model , in which the constituent quarks satisfy the dirac equations with confinement potentials  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7 meson , which couples directly to the @xmath10 and @xmath11 quarks , provides a scalar potential to the quark and as a consequence reduces the constituent quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> the change of the nucleon properties under the influence of the @xmath7 mean field has been studied in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we now treat the @xmath0 hyperon in nuclear medium . according to the ozi rule , the non - strange mesons couple exclusively to the @xmath10 and @xmath11 quarks and not to the @xmath12 quark . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the state of the @xmath12 quark inside the @xmath0 hyperon will not be influenced due to the presence of the non - strange meson mean fields . </S>",
    "<S> we follow ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to take into account the spin correlations and remove the spurious center of mass motion , and then obtain the effective mass for @xmath0 hyperon as @xmath13 , while the effective mass for nucleon is expressed as @xmath14 . here </S>",

    "<S> the quark masses are taken as @xmath23 and @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the spin correlations ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) are fixed by fitting the nucleon and @xmath0 masses in free space ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) .    </S>",

    "<S> the results with the scalar potential are shown by solid curves , while those with the scalar - vector potential by dashed ones . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the effective nucleon mass has been discussed extensively in our previous work  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we now focus on the effective mass for the @xmath0 hyperon . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious that the reduction of @xmath33 is smaller than that of @xmath34 , since only two of the three quarks in the @xmath0 hyperon are influenced by the @xmath7 mean field . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the dependence of the effective masses on the @xmath7 mean field must be calculated self - consistently within the quark model , therefore the ratio of the variation of the effective mass for the @xmath0 hyperon to that for the nucleon , @xmath35 , is not so simple as a constant as in the rmf models  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are the meson masses . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath42 is the electromagnetic field which couples to the protons . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath0 hyperon is neutral and isoscalar , it only couples to the @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the @xmath7 meson on the @xmath0 hyperon is contained in @xmath33 , while the @xmath8 meson couples to the @xmath0 hyperon with the coupling constant @xmath43 ( for the nucleon , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) . in the qmf model , </S>",

    "<S> if we consider the spin of @xmath0 is carried exclusively by the @xmath12 quark , the spin - orbit interaction should come entirely from the thomas precession  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the correction , @xmath60 , could be added perturbatively to the @xmath0 single particle energies , so that the spin - orbit interaction corresponds to the formula from thomas precession  @xcite . with this correction , </S>",
    "<S> small spin - orbit splittings are obtained while the single particle energies are not much altered . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the spin - orbit splitting for the @xmath61 states ( @xmath62 ) in @xmath63 decreases to @xmath64 , while the value is @xmath65 without the perturbative correction . </S>",
    "<S> the recent experimental result  @xcite seems to reveal the splitting of @xmath66 for the @xmath61 states in @xmath67 .    </S>",

    "<S> the parameters in the qmf models have been determined in our previous work  @xcite , therefore no free parameter in the present calculation . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that the final results are insensitive to the choice of the @xmath12 quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that small spin - orbit splittings for the @xmath0 in those hypernuclei are obtained in the present model . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the spin - orbit splittings for the @xmath71 states ( @xmath72 ) in @xmath73 and @xmath74 decrease to @xmath75 and @xmath76 with the perturbative correction , while those values are about @xmath77 and @xmath78 without the perturbative correction . </S>",
    "<S> the small spin - orbit splittings were mostly worked out by adding tensor interactions in the rmf models  @xcite . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , we plot the scalar and vector potentials ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) for the @xmath81 @xmath0 state in @xmath73 and @xmath74 . the results with two types of confinement shown by solid and dashed curves are almost identical . </S>",
    "<S> the attractive scalar potential is mostly canceled by the repulsive vector potential , and their difference at the center of the hypernuclei is about @xmath82 .    </S>",
    "<S> the single particle energies in the present model seem to be slightly underestimated , which is opposite to the tendency in the qmc model . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the properties of @xmath0 hypernuclei are very sensitive to the effective coupling constants on the hadronic level , especially the two relative couplings @xmath83 and @xmath84  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the quark model value , @xmath85 , usually gives large overbinding of @xmath0 single particle energies . </S>",
    "<S> some effects , like correlated @xmath86 exchange , may cause the deviations of @xmath87 and @xmath88 from the quark model value of @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> most studies of the hypernuclei in the rmf models are performed by treating both @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( or only one of them ) as phenomenological parameters , which are fitted by using experimental data  @xcite . in the present model , @xmath90    /\\left[\\frac{\\partial        m_n^*}{\\partial \\sigma}\\right]$ ] </S>",

    "<S> the resulting @xmath0 single particle energies are slightly underestimated in comparison with the experimental values as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . the results can be largely improved if we use the scaled coupling constant , @xmath92 , which gives the @xmath81 single particle energy in @xmath74 to be @xmath93 in @xmath68 and @xmath94 in @xmath69 . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> the results in the qmc model ( without pauli blocking effect ) are overestimated in comparison with the experimental data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the scaled coupling constant , @xmath95 ( or @xmath96 ) , is required in order to reproduce the experimental single particle energies in the qmc model .    </S>",
    "<S> it is very interesting to discuss the origin of this difference , because of the similarity of the qmc and qmf models . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath91 has been used in both models , while @xmath87 has to be calculated with different approaches . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath87 obtained in the qmc model was very close to @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> this is related to its expressions for the effective masses , where the center of mass correction was assumed to be independent of the @xmath7 mean field , and parametrized into the term of @xmath97 . in our calculation </S>",
    "<S> , we keep the center of mass correction , which is found to decrease with increasing @xmath7 mean field , and then we get smaller values than @xmath89 for @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> this seems to be the dominant origin of the underbinding in the qmf model , to be contrasted with the overbinding in the qmc model .    in summary , we have reported the results of the first application of the qmf model to the description of @xmath0 hypernuclei . with the parameters determined by the properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei  @xcite , the calculated results for @xmath0 hypernuclei are acceptable . </S>",
    "<S> the small spin - orbit splittings for the @xmath0 in hypernuclei are obtained in the present model , while the single particle energies are slightly underestimated in comparison with the experimental values . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that about @xmath1 deviation from @xmath91 is required in order to reproduce the experimental single particle energies . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 reduction in @xmath88 provides @xmath98 less repulsion , so that the @xmath0 potential decreases to the empirical value ( @xmath99 ) . in the present calculation , </S>",
    "<S> the effective masses for the nucleon and the @xmath0 hyperon , which play important roles in getting the final results , are obtained with the assumptions that the spin correlations and the confining potentials are not modified in nuclear matter . </S>",
