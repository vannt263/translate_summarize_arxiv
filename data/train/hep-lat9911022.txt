    "the relevance of the chiral fermion issue to fundamental particle physics and to numerical qcd will be explained . in the second part",
    "the basic ideas of the overlap construction will be reviewed . in the third part",
    "i shall focus on the algebraic ( as opposed to kinematic ) meaning of the overlap . in the fourth part",
    "i shall discuss in greater detail the overlap dirac operator on the lattice . in the last part",
    "i shall deal with anomalies , the associated berry phases and f \" orster - nielsen - ninomiya gauge averaging in the context of naturalness .",
    "my main partner in the overlap construction was r. narayanan .",
    "i have also collaborated with p. huet , y. kikukawa , a. yamada and p. vranas .",
    "important contributions to the overlap development were also made by s. randjbar - daemi and j. strathdee .",
    "fermion chirality is one of the most fundamental properties of nature where it appears in association with gauge interactions .",
    "this combination can decouple from a more fundamental theory if anomalies cancel .",
    "it is however not trivial to achieve this decoupling outside perturbation theory , and for a while it was even thought an impossible feat .",
    "the overlap provides an example where the decoupling works in a non - perturbative framework . in a unitary framework",
    "the mechanism requires an infinite number of fermion degrees of freedom per unit four space - time volume .",
    "it would be a major achievement for lattice field theory if it turned out that a similar mechanism is operative in nature .",
    "more details regarding general relevance can be found in @xcite .",
    "the overlap is an outgrowth of a long sequence of papers starting from the fundamental discoveries in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and more specifically @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "my first papers on the subject were all written with narayanan who stayed my collaborator for a long time @xcite , @xcite . in parallel , important contributions to the overlap were made in @xcite .",
    "later , i continued to simplify the overlap in the vector - like context @xcite .",
    "let us start with a formally vector - like gauge theory : @xmath0    @xmath1 and @xmath2 are dirac fermions and the mass matrix @xmath3 is infinite .",
    "it has a single zero mode but its adjoint has no zero modes . as long as @xmath4 this setup is stable under small deformations of the mass matrix implying that radiative corrections will not wash the zero mode away .",
    "kaplan s domain wall suggests the following realization : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is fixed at @xmath8 for negative @xmath9 and at @xmath10 for positive @xmath9 ( @xmath11 . there is no mathematical difficulty associated with the discontinuity at @xmath12 .",
    "the infinite path integral over the fermions is easily `` done '' : on the positive and negative segments of the real line respectively one has propagation with an @xmath9-independent `` hamiltonian '' .",
    "the infinite extent means that at @xmath12 the path integrals produce the overlap ( inner product ) between the two ground states of the many fermion systems corresponding to each side of the origin in @xmath9 .",
    "the infinite extent also means infinite exponents linearly proportional to the respective energies - these factors are subtracted .",
    "one is left with the overlap formula which expresses the chiral determinant as @xmath13 .",
    "the states are in second quantized formalism . by convention",
    ", they are normalized , but their phases are left arbitrary .",
    "this ambiguity is essential , as we shall see later on .",
    "it has no effect in the vector - like case . in first quantized formalism",
    "the overlap is : @xmath14 the elements of the matrix @xmath15 are the overlaps between single body wave - functions , @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath17 s span the negative energy subspace of @xmath18 and the @xmath19 s span the negative energy subspace of @xmath20 .",
    "i used continuum like notation to emphasize that the hamiltonians are arbitrary regularizations of massive four dimensional dirac operators with large masses of opposite signs .",
    "the hamiltonians only enter as defining the dirac seas and there is no distinction between the different levels within each sea ; all that matters is whether a certain single particle state has negative or positive energy .",
    "thus , all the required information is also contained in the operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the sign function .",
    "thus the @xmath17 s are all the @xmath24 eigenstates of @xmath25 and the @xmath19 s are all the @xmath24 eigenstates of @xmath26 . to switch chiralities one only has to switch the sign of the hamiltonians .",
    "this is a result of charge conjugation combined with a particle - hole transformation .",
    "when @xmath27 is taken to infinity in lattice units one is left with @xmath28 with no gauge field dependence . on the other hand , @xmath26 always maintains a dependence on the gauge background and its trace gives the topological charge of the gauge field .",
    "more recently , a construction starting from the gw relation @xcite has been presented as new @xcite .",
    "this is misleading , since the `` new '' construction merely reproduces the structure of the overlap .",
    "the only differences are in technicalities surrounding the phase choice of the overlap .",
    "these technicalities are not trivial , but i would be surprised if any new particle physics were produced by this effort . to be sure , a successful completion of the phase choice program would be news in mathematical physics , and would make me happy .",
    "the proposal of the `` new '' construction was preceded by the observation that the overlap satisfies the gw relation @xcite , @xcite and that the overlap - gw relation is essentially one to one @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus , it should have been obvious that starting from the gw relation will lead to the overlap structure in the chiral case .",
    "the insistence of the proponents of the `` new '' construction to obscure its structural equivalence to the overlap has generated much confusion and waste of time , deflecting energy from some valid physics problems that are still open .",
    "for example , it is an important open question whether a genuinely different natural construction of chiral gauge theories is possible .",
    "the gw relation is a complicated way to write down what is best described as the algebraic content of the overlap .",
    "it is much simpler to rephrase and slightly generalize : the setup is that of a `` kato pair '' @xcite , an arrangement further developed in the quantum hall effect context by avron , seiler and simon @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "the core objects are the two hermitian reflections , @xmath26 and @xmath25 introduced above .",
    "they are equivalent to two orthogonal projectors @xmath29 , the kato pair ( @xmath30 ) . defining h=12(+^ ) ,",
    "s=12(-^ ) , we arrive at the following fundamental relations : h^2 + s^2 = 1 ,  \\{h , s } = 0 .",
    "these relations allow us to write any element in the algebra generated by @xmath31 and @xmath9 as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a central element .",
    "geometrically , @xmath34 and @xmath35 generate two orthogonal decompositions of the entire space @xmath36 .",
    "a natural operator mapping one subspace of one decomposition to another subspace of the other decomposition was introduced by kato .",
    "it coincides with overlap dirac operator .",
    "d_o = 12 ( 1+^)=^h = h . that it connects the two decompositions",
    "is evident from @xmath37 . in the overlap context @xmath38",
    "was found via the following easily proven identity : det d_0 = |det m|^2 .",
    "the following decomposition of the hilbert space into subspaces invariant under @xmath31 and @xmath9 holds : = ker ( h ) ker ( s ) _ .",
    "@xmath39 by virtue of @xmath40 .",
    "one also has ker(h)=ker(s-1)ker ( s+1 ) ,  ker(s)=ker(h-1)ker ( h+1 ) .",
    "a special property of the kato pair in the overlap context is that @xmath41 are both gauge field dependent and that for all backgrounds @xmath42 .",
    "one can introduce now a definition of index ( ^ , ) = dim ker ( s-1 ) - dim ker ( s+1)= tr s^2n+1 for any integer @xmath43 . to prove @xmath44-independence of the right hand side use @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "reversing the roles of @xmath31 and @xmath9 switches the sign of the index .",
    "it turns out that the index is exactly the topological charge of the gauge field as sensed by the overlap @xcite .",
    "moreover , if @xmath47 and @xmath48 are isolated points of the spectrum of @xmath9 and both @xmath49 and @xmath50 are finite dimensional the definition extends to @xmath51 .    until now the roles of @xmath31 and @xmath9 were symmetrical , and there is no massless fermion in sight .",
    "the entire setup is pure mathematics .",
    "the kinematic part of the construction is in the relationship between the reflections ( or projectors ) and the massive dirac operator .",
    "this is the basis of the lattice realization of the overlap idea to be covered in the next section . here",
    ", we shall devote a few lines to explain why the kato pair is an algebraic set - up which is essentially equivalent to the ginsparg wilson relation .",
    "the ginsparg wilson relation is : \\{d , _ 5 } = 2 d_5 r d .",
    "one adds to the above the following requirements : ( 1 ) @xmath52-hermiticity , @xmath53 ; ( 2 ) @xmath54=0 $ ] ; ( 3 ) @xmath55 ; @xmath56 is local in the site index .",
    "it goes without saying that @xmath57 and @xmath56 transform covariantly under gauge transformations and that @xmath57 should be local in some sense .    choosing @xmath58 it is obvious that @xmath38 satisfies the gw relation and the extra requirements with @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath26 , being associated with very massive fermions , will be essentially local . in the lattice context , as we shall see in the next section , some gauge backgrounds need to be excluded if locality is to hold absolutely .",
    "what may be less obvious is the other direction of the equivalence , namely , that the gw relation implies a kato pair .",
    "starting from the gw relation takes one back to the overlap situation at the algebraic level , i.e. , before the explicit form of the reflection @xmath26 is given . the reflection @xmath25 , which is quite free in the overlap , is restricted in the gw case to @xmath52 .",
    "the first step is to eliminate @xmath56 , by showing that any solution with @xmath59 produces a solution with an arbitrary @xmath56 .",
    "this can be done in at least two ways @xcite .",
    "the first starts from the main observation that the basic gw relation @xcite can be written as \\{d^-1(r ) - r,_5 } = 0 and therefore setting @xmath60 ensures that @xmath61 is a solution if @xmath62 is .",
    "although the inverse of @xmath63 is non - local by the well known no - go theorems , @xmath64 has only zeros at the `` doubler '' locations in the free case , and @xmath56 removes these zeros from @xmath65 , so that @xmath61 ends up local . once @xmath61 is local and doubler free in the free case , locality in the presence of lattice backgrounds that are sufficiently close to the continuum is assured .",
    "the second way is to set @xmath66 .",
    "so , nothing is lost or gained in principle by fixing @xmath59 .    for @xmath59",
    "it is trivial to go back to the reflections : one just looks at the formula for @xmath38 to define the operator @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "it is trivial that this operator is hermitian and squares to unity by the basic gw formula @xcite .",
    "so , @xmath62 is just another @xmath38 .",
    "now it is trivial to extract @xmath31 and @xmath9 , since @xmath25 is given as @xmath52 .",
    "also , it is a trivial matter to go to the matrix @xmath15 and the chiral case .",
    "the massless fermions enter as a representation of the difference between dirac operators with masses of opposite sign .",
    "there are no particular difficulties to regularize _ massive _ dirac fermions , in the continuum or on the lattice . on the lattice the spectra of the dirac operators",
    "get compactified and the regularization is fully non - perturbative .",
    "first , some notation : let @xmath68 denote @xmath69 link matrices on a finite @xmath70-dimensional hypercubic lattice .",
    "the directional parallel transporters @xmath71 are : t _ ( ) ( x ) = u_(x ) ( x+ ) .",
    "let @xmath72 with @xmath73 describe a gauge transformation .",
    "g(g ) t_(u ) g^(g ) = t_(u^g ) ,   where ,   u^g_(x ) = g(x ) u_(x ) g^(x+ ) .",
    "a lattice replacement of the massive continuum dirac operator , @xmath74 , is an element in the algebra generated by @xmath75 .",
    "thus , @xmath74 is gauge covariant .",
    "the wilson dirac operator , @xmath76 can be written as : d_w = m+_(1- v _ ) ;  v_^v_=1 ;  v_= 1-_2 t_+1+_2 t_^. the hermitian wilson dirac operator is @xmath77 . in terms of the continuum covariant derivative @xmath78 , for lattice spacing @xmath79 , @xmath80 , with no sum on @xmath81 .",
    "we choose the following norm definition for matrices @xmath82 : @xmath83 .",
    "the norm of a gauge covariant matrix is gauge invariant .",
    "@xmath84 is a maximal eigenvalue .",
    "our two reflections are defined by : ^= _ m+ ( h_w ( m ) ) = _ d+1 ;   =( h_w ( m ) )  with  -2<m<0 . for @xmath26 to be defined everywhere we need @xmath85 .",
    "this can be assured if the pure gauge action enforces an upper bound on the norms of @xmath86 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the following inequality , when meaningful , specifies what constraint would be sufficient : ^12 ^ 12 -|1+m| ,",
    "-2 < m < 0 .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath87 \\| = \\|1 - p_{\\mu\\nu}\\|$ ] is compatible with the continuum limit , where the @xmath71 s almost commute : @xmath86^\\dagger [ t_\\mu , t_\\nu ] = ( 1-p_{\\mu\\nu})^\\dagger ( 1-p_{\\mu\\nu})$ ] , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "any pure gauge action with the right continuum limit and close to it will strongly prefer configurations where all @xmath91 are close to unit matrix .",
    "on the other hand , a latticized instanton can be smoothly deformed to a trivial configuration , so there exist gauge field backgrounds for which @xmath92 has an exact zero mode .",
    "this is true of any @xmath93 in the range @xmath94 .",
    "the above analysis tells us that at least one plaquette will be relatively big for this configuration .",
    "unless we enforce the constraint fully , there always will be possibly rare configurations where @xmath26 is not well defined .    to fully appreciate the differentiation between the algebraic character of the gw relation and the more complete framework of the overlap ,",
    "let me give some examples of bad solutions to the gw relation : d^(1)_gw = 12 ( 1+_5 ( h_w ( m_1 ) ) , &   d^(2)_gw = 12 ( 1-_5 ( h_w ( m_2 ) ) ;  m_1,2 > 0 . + d^(3)_gw = 12 ( 1-_5 ( h_w ( m_3 ) ) ; &  -2 < m_3",
    "< 0 .solutions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) have always trivial index , ( 1 ) has no massless fermions at all , while ( 2 ) has 16 .",
    "( 3 ) is motivated by the @xmath41 symmetry , describes 15 fermions and has a nontrivial index , but 7 fermions contribute to it one way , and 8 the other .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath95 is well defined and gauge invariant , but the complex number itself is defined only up to phase . in the general case",
    "we have a @xmath96 bundle defined over the space of gauge fields with @xmath97 , a gauge invariant condition .",
    "@xmath98 is gauge field independent and gauge invariant and @xmath99 comes from a gauge covariant hamiltonian .",
    "thus , the @xmath96 bundle can be viewed as defined over the space of gauge orbits . with the exclusion of the points",
    "@xmath100 this space can support non - trivial @xmath96 bundles as required for anomalies .",
    "a more familiar way for physicists is to think in terms of berry phases .",
    "the main point is that the matrices @xmath101 are smooth in the link variables and this smoothness is inherited by the states @xmath102 . with it",
    "come the inevitable berry phase factors .",
    "the berry phase factors come from parallel transport on the space of gauge fields with berry s connection @xmath103 . assuming some choice of states @xmath104 ( possibly requiring patches with overlays ) berry s connection is the following one - form over each patch in the space of gauge fields : = v \\ { u } |d v \\ { u } .",
    "berry s phases come from wilson loop factors associated with @xmath103 .",
    "this makes it obvious why they are independent of the choice of phases for the @xmath104 .",
    "the non - triviality of berry s phase is locally measured by the associated abelian field strength , a globally defined two - form that usually does not vanish : = da .",
    "while @xmath103 depends on the phase choices of the @xmath104 , @xmath105 does not , a fact which is reflected by expressing @xmath105 in terms of the reflection @xmath106 alone : = -14 tr [ ( h_w ( m ) )  d(h_w ( m ) )   d(h_w ( m ) ) ] .    to understand the meaning of @xmath103",
    "let us review briefly one way of looking at anomalies in the continuum .",
    "we are restricting our attention to the non - abelian case .",
    "after all , in the four dimensional abelian case the gauge coupling is nt asymptotically free and the entire issue of mathematical existence of an interacting chiral gauge theory is a moot point .",
    "once one has some definition of a regulated chiral determinant one can take a variation with respect to the vector potential @xmath107 to get a current , a nonlocal functional @xmath108 of the gauge field @xmath107 .",
    "if the regulated chiral determinant is gauge invariant @xmath108 transforms covariantly under gauge transformations , but when there are anomalies and the regulated chiral determinant is not gauge invariant @xmath108 has a complicated transformation .",
    "however , one can always define a covariant current , @xmath109 which does transform covariantly .",
    "moreover , @xmath110 is a local , calculable functional of @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "one can not use @xmath111 to reconstruct a gauge invariant regulated determinant because it can not be written as the variation of a functional of @xmath107 since it does not obey the wess - zumion consistency conditions .",
    "if anomalies do cancel one can find a regularization ( at least in perturbation theory ) with @xmath112 ; then @xmath113 can be regulated first and a regulated gauge invariant determinant can be constructed .",
    "the main observation is that berry s connection @xmath103 on the lattice ( when summed over all fermion multiplet contributions ) plays the role of @xmath110 @xcite . to see this we view the lattice currents as one forms over the space of gauge fields .",
    "j_consistent = dv^| v = v^| d v _ + a . by definition , @xmath114 .",
    "the covariant current is j_covariant = v^| d v _ . and",
    "it is quite obvious that it has to transform covariantly because it is unaffected by a phase change in the choice of the @xmath115 and hence is insulated of any gauge breaking step .",
    "@xmath103 only depends on the overlap of the state @xmath115 with a state @xmath116 with @xmath117 close to @xmath118 .",
    "this is in contrast to the overlap or the currents where @xmath115 is overlapped with a very different state , @xmath98 .",
    "this is why @xmath103 is local in the gauge fields but the currents are not @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this interpretation of @xmath103 is made solid by the following result : consider an anomalous theory .",
    "one can find a two parameter family of gauge backgrounds which becomes a two torus when restricted to orbit space .",
    "@xmath105 can also be restricted to orbit space because it is explicitly gauge invariant .",
    "one can integrate @xmath105 over this two torus and the result is proportional to an integer .",
    "the integer is precisely the same as the one entering the anomaly coefficient .",
    "the result can be easily shown to be consistent with a known continuum expression .",
    "on the lattice this result means that there are `` monopole '' like singularities in @xmath103 .",
    "these singularities can not be removed by small deformations of the matrix @xmath119 .",
    "thus , we can not envisage altering @xmath119 so that @xmath103 vanish .",
    "but , if anomalies do cancel the obstruction is removed .",
    "on the basis of this i propose two conjectures @xcite :    * iff anomalies cancel can one deform the total hamiltonian so that one attains @xmath120 without the overlap going through any singularity . * if @xmath120 there is a natural phase choice for @xmath115 , determined by parallel transport with respect to an @xmath103 , such that the action of gauge transformations is non - projective : for any gauge transformation @xmath121 , its representation on the fermions , @xmath72 obeys g(g ) |v \\ { u } = |v \\ { u^g } .",
    "if these conjectures are true it would follow that one could fine tune @xmath119 so that , provided anomalies cancel , a natural smooth gauge invariant phase choice for the overlap exists .",
    "still , this solution , if it indeed works , looks somewhat contrived for nature because it requires a fine tuning of the hamiltonian used in the construction .",
    "i believe that this fine tuning is not necessary .",
    "if a fine tuned hamiltonian exists , any hamiltonian close enough to it would also work , although a residual gauge dependence would be present .",
    "one would simply average over the gauge degrees of freedom ( integrate them out ) and this would have no effect on the continuum limit @xcite . if anomalies do not cancel , the gauge dependence is always large enough that gauge averaging induces new non - local terms in the action .",
    "indeed , the gauge dependence contains a lattice version of a nontrivial wess - zumino term .",
    "when anomalies cancel but one still has a small amount of gauge breaking , gauge averaging only adds some extra gauge invariant local terms to the action .",
    "this has been shown numerically in a two dimensional chiral model @xcite .",
    "there exists an important special case where there are anomalies but @xmath105 vanishes .",
    "it is in four dimensions with gauge group @xmath122 and weyl fermions in the @xmath123 representation .",
    "then the matrix @xmath124 can be made real by a global base choice .",
    "still , berry s phase factors can take the values @xmath125 and thus witten s anomaly is reproduced @xcite .",
    "this again shows that in the overlap all anomalies are encoded in berry s phases .",
    "although the overlap at present does not provide a rigorous construction for chiral gauge theories in the non - abelian case , it has passed the boundary of physical plausibility , relegating the completion of this construction to the branch of mathematical physics . for physics",
    "the main question is : does there exist a truly new way to regulate chiral symmetries , or is the way opened by kaplan and by frolov and slavnov and subsequently realized by the overlap unique in some sense ?",
    "my research at rutgers is partially supported by the doe under grant # de - fg05 - 96er40559 .",
