    "the ratio of branching fractions @xmath14 is typically used instead of the absolute branching fraction of @xmath15 to reduce several systematic uncertainties , such as those on the experimental efficiency , the magnitude of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix element @xmath16 and the semileptonic decay form factors .",
    "the sm calculations on these ratios predict @xmath17  @xcite and @xmath18  @xcite with a precision of better than 2% and 6% for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "exclusive semitauonic @xmath7 decays were first observed by belle  @xcite , with subsequent studies reported by belle @xcite , @xcite , and lhcb @xcite .",

    "the combined analysis of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , taking into account measurement correlations , finds that the deviation is @xmath25 from the sm prediction  @xcite .",
    "so far , measurements of @xmath26 at the @xmath7 factories have been performed using hadronic @xcite or inclusive tagging methods @xcite .",
    "semileptonic tagging methods have been employed in studies of @xmath27 decays and have been shown to have similar experimental precision to that of the hadronic tagging method @xcite . in this paper , we report the first measurement of @xmath19 using the semileptonic tagging method .",
    "we reconstruct signal @xmath28 events in modes where one @xmath7 decays semitauonically , @xmath29 followed by @xmath30 ( referred to hereinafter as @xmath31 ) , and the other @xmath7 decays in a semileptonic channel @xmath32 ( referred to hereinafter as @xmath33 ) .",
    "in order to form @xmath19 , we also reconstruct normalization @xmath28 events in modes where both @xmath7 mesons decay to @xmath34 .",
    "we use the full @xmath4 data sample containing @xmath35 @xmath36 pairs recorded with the belle detector @xcite at the kekb @xmath5 collider @xcite .",
    "the belle detector is a general - purpose magnetic spectrometer , which consists of a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel threshold cherenkov counters ( acc ) , time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecl ) comprising csi(tl ) crystals .",
    "the devices are located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5 t magnetic field .",
    "an iron flux - return yoke located outside the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath37 mesons and to identify muons ( klm ) .",
    "the detector is described in detail elsewhere @xcite .    to determine the reconstruction efficiency and probability density functions ( pdf ) for signal , normalization , and background processes , we use monte carlo ( mc ) simulated events , which are generated with the evtgen event generator @xcite and simulated with the geant3 package @xcite .",
    "the mc samples for signal events are generated using the decay model based on the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) in ref .",

    "radially excited states are neglected .",
    "we consider @xmath42 decays to a @xmath47 and a pion , a @xmath48 or an @xmath49 meson , or a pair of pions , where branching fractions are assumed based on quantum - number , phase - space , and isospin arguments .",
    "the sample sizes of the signal , @xmath3 , and continuum @xmath50 @xmath51 production processes correspond to about 40 , 10 , and 6 times the integrated luminosity of the on - resonance @xmath4 data sample , respectively .",
    "charged particle tracks are reconstructed with the svd and cdc . all tracks other than @xmath52 decay daughters",
    "are required to originate from near the interaction point ( ip ) .",
    "electrons are identified by a combination of the specific ionization ( @xmath53 ) in the cdc , the ratio of the cluster energy in the ecl to the track momentum measured with the svd and cdc , the response of the acc , the shower shape in the ecl , and the match between the positions of the shower and the track at the ecl  @xcite .",
    "to recover bremsstrahlung photons from electrons , we add the four - momentum of each photon detected within 0.05 radians of the original track direction to the electron momentum .",

    "we then impose the following additional requirements : both pion tracks must have a large distance of closest approach to the ip in the plane perpendicular to the electron beam line ; the pion tracks must intersect at a common vertex that is displaced from the ip ; and the momentum vector of the @xmath54 candidate should originate from the ip .",
    "neutral pion candidates are formed from pairs of photons with further criteria specific to whether the @xmath59 is from a @xmath60 decay or @xmath61 decay",

    "the lepton identification efficiencies are separately corrected for electrons and for muons to account for differences between the detector responses in data and mc . correction factors for lepton identification efficiencies are evaluated as a functions of the momentum and direction of the lepton using @xmath122 and @xmath123 decays .",

    "we can not independently determine calibration factors for all @xmath61 meson decay modes as we use other decay modes when we calibrate each specific decay mode of a given @xmath61 meson . to estimate all the calibration factors correctly , we first perform the two - dimensional fit for each decay mode without weighting factors , and then iterate the fits using resultant weighting factors until all calibration factors converge .    similarly , we estimate calibration factors for events with correctly and falsely reconstructed @xmath91 mesons from a two - dimensional fit to @xmath92 .",
