    "semiconductor - based spintronic technology , where both the electrical charge and the spin of carriers are utilized for signal processing and storage , calls for the development of new ferromagnetic materials .",
    "the iii - v dilute magnetic semiconductor ( ga , mn)as , being compatible with conventional semiconductor technology , is considered a potential candidate for spintronics and has been intensely studied during the past few years.@xcite the ferromagnetic properties of ( ga , mn)as , successfully explained within the zener mean - field model@xcite , arise from the @xmath2 spins of mn atoms incorporated on ga lattice sites . the ferromagnetic mn - mn coupling is mediated by delocalized or weakly localized holes which are supplied by the mn atoms acting as acceptors on ga lattice sites .",
    "the mn spin system undergoes a ferromagnetic phase transition at the curie temperature @xmath3 which is suggested to strongly depend on both , the mn content and the hole concentration.@xcite ( ga , mn)as is grown by molecular - beam epitaxy ( mbe ) at low temperatures ( @xmath4250@xmath0c ) . in most cases , @xmath3 is increased by post - growth annealing at temperatures near or even below the growth temperature , resulting in values of up to 160 k in ( ga , mn)as single layers , as reported so far.@xcite this is commonly explained by the removal or rearrangement of highly unstable compensating defects such as mn atoms on interstitial lattice sites.@xcite the enhancement of the ferromagnetism associated with low - temperature ( lt ) annealing is suppressed in the presence of a thin gaas capping layer , indicating that diffusion of defects towards the surface plays a crucial role in the annealing process.@xcite it has been revealed by electrochemical capacitance - voltage ( ecv ) profiling and raman spectroscopy that in general the hole concentration @xmath5 is not constant throughout the ( ga , mn)as layer but exhibits a vertical gradient.@xcite starting at the gaas/(ga , mn)as interface , @xmath5 monotonously increases and reaches its maximum value near the sample surface .",
    "this finding is in agreement with the results of spin - wave resonance experiments which manifest the existence of a gradient in the magnetic properties.@xcite    for ( ga , mn)as , it is well known that , within a limited temperature range , a slight increase of the growth temperature results in a pronounced enhancement of both , @xmath3 and @xmath5.@xcite in addition , a significant increase of the surface temperature , induced by heat radiation from the effusion cells , has been detected during lt mbe growth of gaas.@xcite therefore , we suppose that besides annealing effects during growth a gradual increase of the surface temperature due do free carrier absorption is likely to account for the observed gradient . even though disregarded by most other groups so far",
    ", the presence of the gradient seems to be a general phenomenon , whereas its specific profile depends on several parameters such as sample thickness and growth conditions . from the @xmath5-dependence of @xmath3",
    "it becomes obvious that a pronounced variation in @xmath5 along the growth direction must have a strong impact on the electrical and magnetic properties of ( gamn)as .    in this work , the effect of annealing at 250@xmath0c on the depth profile of hole concentration in ( ga , mn)as epilayers with thicknesses between 0.2 and 1.2 @xmath6 m is studied by ecv profiling , micro - raman spectroscopy , conductivity measurements , superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetization measurements , and secondary ion mass spectroscopy ( sims ) .",
    "it is shown that the gradient in the carrier density plays a key role in the understanding of annealing - induced effects , such as the increase in conductivity and curie temperature . from our sims and ecv data",
    "we infer that , at least in thick layers ( @xmath4  1  @xmath6 m ) , out - diffusion of mn interstitials is not the dominant mechanism for the annealing - induced enhancement of the hole density , as recently proposed for thin layers ( @xmath7 100 nm).@xcite while most reports in the literature are on ( ga , mn)as epilayers with thicknesses in the range of 10 - 200 nm , where the gradient is probably less pronounced , thicker samples , as considered in this work , allow to map the depth profiles , e.g. , of the hole and mn concentration over larger distances , and therefore to get more detailed information to the understanding of the defect dynamics .",
    "provided that the fundamental diffusion processes during annealing are primarily independent of the layer thickness , the findings reported in this paper may be helpful in the interpretation of experimental data obtained from much thinner samples as well .",

    "this explanation also accounts for the fact that , compared to the total amount of mn inside the ( ga , mn)as layer , only a negligibly small fraction of mn effectively migrates out of the bulk .",
    "the second mechanism is more hypothetical and rests upon an assumed out - diffusion of highly mobile , possibly compensating , defects other than mn@xmath61 , acting at least partially as a trigger for the rearrangement of mn@xmath61 .",
    "arsenic located in interstitial positions ( as@xmath61 ) may be a potential candidate for such a defect .",
    "similar to lt gaas@xcite the lt mbe growth of ( ga , mn)as leads to the incorporation of excess as up to 2@xmath36 , acting at least partially as compensating donor defects.@xcite even though controversially discussed , several authors suggest that in lt gaas a considerable fraction of the excess as atoms is located in interstitial positions , acting as highly mobile defects , while the rest of the excess as is believed to be in antisite positions ( as@xmath63).@xcite as@xmath63 defects are known to remain stable up to 450@xmath0c and are therefore not expected to play a significant role in the physical processes taking place at 250@xmath0c.@xcite whereas a rearrangement of mn@xmath61 could be revealed in ( ga , mn)as by combined channeling rutherford backscattering and by particle - induced x - ray emission experiments@xcite , out - diffusion of as is difficult to verify . as atoms , which diffuse from interstitial sites to the sample surface during annealing , efficiently desorb at the surface and are therefore hardly detected by surface sensitive methods .",
    "the depth profile of the hole concentration in thick ( @xmath1 200 nm ) mbe - grown ( ga , mn)as layers , measured by ecv profiling , as well as its strong change upon post - growth annealing at 250@xmath0c has been shown to play a key role in the interpretation of conductivity and magnetization data .",
    "the annealing - induced increase in the total hole concentration , derived from ecv profiling , is in excellent quantitative agreement with the change in electrical conductivity measured _ in situ _ during annealing .",
    "the pronounced enhancement of the hole density near the sample surface , confirmed by micro - raman measurements , is accompanied by a distinct increase of the curie temperature .",
    "the particular evolution of the measured ecv profiles under continued annealing suggests that diffusion processes play a major role in the post - growth annealing of ( ga , mn)as . from a comparison between the ecv profiles and the mn distributions determined by sims , it is concluded that , in contrast to thin layers , the increase in hole density upon post - growth annealing in thick ( @xmath4  1  @xmath6 m ) samples is not primarily due to out - diffusion of mn@xmath61 .",
    "we suppose that a depth - dependent rearrangement of mn@xmath61 in the bulk , initiated by an out - diffusion of mn@xmath61 from the near - surface region , accounts for the change in the hole - density profile .",
    "alternatively , a process based on the out - diffusion of other highly mobile defects , such as as@xmath61 , has been tentatively discussed .",
