    "the interference of electrons is one of the most basic phenomena which illustrate the quantum nature of electrons . in recent years",
    ", technological advances have allowed electron interferometry to be used for a variety of investigations  @xcite",
    ". however , the quality of the interference pattern obtained with electrons is never as good as can be achieved with light or with neutral atoms .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that charged particles interact more strongly with their environment than do photons or neutral atoms , and are hence more subject to loss of quantum coherence , or decoherence .",
    "this can arise from a variety of effects , such as interaction with random fields in the interferometer or with thermal radiation .",
    "recently , sonentag and hasselbach  @xcite observed decoherence as a result of dissipative interaction with image charge fields near an imperfectly conducting plate . in principle , these effects could be removed if there are no photons or classical fields in the interferometer",
    ". however , there is still a decoherence effect even when the quantized electromagnetic field is initially in its vacuum state  @xcite .",
    "this effect can be interpreted as arising from photon emission by the electrons .",
    "the emission of a photon with sufficiently short wavelength can reveal which path a particular electron takes and hence acts to destroy the interference pattern .",

    "an equivalent description is in terms of a fluctuating aharonov - bohm phase .    in this paper",
    ", we will be concerned with the effects of squeezed photon states on the electron coherence .",
    "squeezed states describe reduced quantum fluctuations in one variable at the expense of increased fluctuations in the conjugate variable .",
    "one remarkable property is that they can exhibit locally negative energy densities .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood as a suppression of vacuum fluctuations .",
    "the normal ordered stress tensor operator is a difference between an expectation value in a given state and that in the vacuum , a difference which can become negative .",
    "as will be detailed in the next section , electron decoherence due to a fluctuating electromagnetic field can be ascribed to fluctuations of the aharonov - bohm phase . as we will demonstrate , it is possible to use squeezed states of the quantized electromagnetic field to reduce these fluctuations , leading to a decrease in decoherence , which we will call `` recoherence '' . squeezed states and coherent electrons were discussed in a somewhat different context by vourdas and sanders  @xcite , who developed a procedure by which coherent electrons may be used to measure quantum states of the electromagnetic field .    the outline of this paper is as follows : in sect .  [",
    "s : general_formalism ] , we outline the formalism of decoherence by a fluctuating aharonov - bohm phase .",
    "we then apply this formalism to the case of a single - mode squeezed state in sect .",
    "[ s : single_mode ] and calculate the degree of recoherence which is possible .",
    "these calculations are extended to multi - mode squeezed states in sect .",

    "[ sec : estimates ] . in sect .",
    "[ sec : final ] , we summarize and discuss our results . some of the properties of squeezed states are reviewed in the appendix . unless otherwise noted , we use lorentz - heaviside units with @xmath0 .",
    "here we briefly review the effects of electromagnetic field fluctuations on electron coherence  @xcite . consider a double slit interference experiment",
    "in which coherent electrons can take either one of two paths , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : paths ] .",
    "first consider the case of no field fluctuations .",
    "if the amplitudes for the electrons to take path @xmath1 and @xmath2 are @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , to point @xmath5 , then the mean number of electrons at @xmath5 will be proportional to @xmath6 in the presence of a classical , non - fluctuating electromagnetic field described by vector potential @xmath7 , there will be an aharonov - bohm phase shift of the form  @xcite .",
    "@xmath8 where the integral is taken around the closed path @xmath9 .",
    "this shifts the locations of the interference minima and maxima , but does not alter their relative amplitudes , the contrast .",
    "if the electromagnetic field undergoes fluctuations , then the situation is different . in this case",
    ", the fluctuating aharonov - bohm phase causes a change in the contrast by a factor of @xmath10 where we define the _ coherence functional _ by @xmath11 with the angular brackets denoting averaging over the fluctuations .",
    "this functional can be expressed as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the fine - structure constant and @xmath14 so far , we have not specified the source of the fluctuations , which could be thermal , quantum , or due to averaging over classical time variations  @xcite . in this paper , we will be concerned with quantum fluctuations in a squeezed vacuum state .",
    "in this section , we consider the special case where the quantized electromagnetic field is in a state in which one mode is excited to a squeezed vacuum state , and all other modes remain in the ground state .",
    "we take the excited mode to be a plane wave in a box with periodic boundary conditions , with wave vector @xmath16 and polarization @xmath17 , so the quantum state may be denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "the paths @xmath19 and @xmath20 are taken to be in the @xmath21 plane and we suppose that the electron wavepacket is prepared to be highly localized about the classical trajectory and its dispersion can be ignored in the classical limit  @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath22-component of the electron velocity is constant , and the trajectories @xmath19 and @xmath20 are chosen to be symmetric to one another with respect to the @xmath23 plane , then in a co - moving frame where the electron only has the sideways motion along the @xmath24 axis , the quantity @xmath25 can be greatly simplified to @xmath26    if we are only interested in the change of the fringe contrast due to the excitation of a particular squeezed vacuum mode , then after subtracting the vacuum contribution of all modes , we have the renormalized coherence functional given by @xmath27 here we use the subscript @xmath28 to denote the renormalized quantity , which has the minkowski vacuum term subtracted . in the coulomb gauge , the @xmath24 component of the vector potential in the plane wave expansion takes the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the unit vector along the @xmath24 axis and @xmath31 are unit polarization vectors .",
    "the quantity @xmath32 is the box normalization volume and @xmath33 . if we further assume that the mode @xmath34 is polarized in the @xmath24 direction , and its wave vector is directed in the @xmath35 direction , then the renormalized hadamard function in squeezed vacuum is given by @xmath36\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the complex squeeze parameter defined in the appendix .",

    "to evaluate @xmath15 , we pick a path which is twice differentiable , @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be thought of as the effective flight time and path separation , respectively .",
    "electrons which start from the source at different times will experience different fluctuations .",
    "we can study this effect by letting @xmath44 be the electron emission time , in which case the quantity @xmath15 becomes @xmath45\\notag\\\\ & = -\\frac{8\\pi\\alpha\\ , \\eta}{v\\bar{\\omega } } \\bigl[\\mu\\,\\cos(2\\bar{\\omega}t_0-\\theta)+\\eta \\bigr]m\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 ^ 2\\,.\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath49 does not depend on the electron emission time @xmath44 and is always positive definite , so the sign of @xmath15 is solely determined by the quantity @xmath50 .",
    "an intriguing feature is that the values of @xmath51 are not always negative , and they can be positive , depending on the parameters @xmath44 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "it implies that the amplitude factor @xmath54 may be larger than unity for some moments , which in turn means that the contrast on the screen can be higher than it would otherwise be for the vacuum state .",
    "this is generally interpreted as enhancement of coherence , or recoherence .",
    "this contrast change can not be observed right away when only one electron is released at each moment .",
    "we have to wait for sufficiently long time so that enough electrons are accumulated to have visible patterns . however , since @xmath44 is related to the electron emission time and is assumed to be a random variable , if the time scale of the measurement is much longer than the flight time @xmath42 , then it is an long - time - averaged result that should be observed , @xmath55 hence this time - averaged value of @xmath15 is always negative .",
    "this means that measurements which average over a long time will always find decoherence from the presence of the squeezed vacuum state , but measurements on shorter time scales have a chance to find @xmath56 , which means transient recoherence .",
    "this feature bears a strong resemblance to the issue of negative energy density .",
    "it is known that quantum field theory has the remarkable property that local energy density can be negative even though the energy density is a positive - definite quantity in classical physics . it is a general feature of both free and interacting theories that there exist states in which the energy density at a particular point can be arbitrarily negative  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the total energy , integrated over all space , is required to be non - negative .",
    "it is also shown that there exist quantum inequalities  @xcite which constrain the magnitude and duration of the negative energy density and flux .",
    "physically , the inequalities imply that the energy density seen by an observer can not be arbitrarily negative for an arbitrarily long period of time .",
    "marecki  @xcite has recently derived variants of the quantum inequalities for limiting the amount of squeezing which might be observed in photodetection experiments in quantum optics .",
    "therefore it is interesting to know whether there exists a similar inequality on the quantity @xmath15 , at least for the squeezed vacuum , to limit how positive it can be and for how long .",
    "define a new function @xmath57 which includes all @xmath58-dependence of the quantity @xmath15 , @xmath59 ,     \\label{eq : g}\\ ] ] with @xmath60 then @xmath15 can be expressed in terms of @xmath57 by @xmath61 and the behavior of @xmath57 will tell us how the quantity @xmath15 depends on the parameter @xmath58 . from fig .",
    "[ fi : squeezed_state ] , we see that @xmath15 is positive only if the time variable @xmath62 lies in the time interval between @xmath63 and @xmath64 . if we can somehow collect only those electrons that are emitted during those moments , then we can guarantee a positive average value of the quantity @xmath15 .",
    "hence the recoherence of the electron interference may be maintained and may remain strong enough to be observed .",
    "next , we will discuss how to compute the averaged value , @xmath65 , formed by averaging @xmath15 over the interval in which it is positive .      since only the function @xmath57 will affect the overall sign of @xmath15 , it is sufficient to calculate the time averaged value of @xmath57 between @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    ". then @xmath65 is just proportional to this averaged value @xmath66 .",

    "we intermediately know that @xmath57 will be identically equal to zero in this limit .",
    "the width of the interval , @xmath87 , approaches to a finite value @xmath88 .",
    "thus the average value @xmath89 will be vanishing accordingly .",
    "in contrast , the maximum of the function @xmath57 grows exponentially as @xmath58 increases , and the minimum decreases , approaching a lower bound of @xmath90 .",
    "the width of the interval , over which the average is performed , decreases to zero in the limit @xmath91 .",

    ", although the width of the integration interval vanishes as @xmath93 , the function @xmath89 is still bounded between @xmath94 and @xmath92 .",

    "one might be concerned that @xmath98 could lead to a violation of unitarity , but this is not the case , because the vacuum effect will always dominate and lead to @xmath99 .",
