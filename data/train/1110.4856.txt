    "some decades ago regge and wheeler began a pioneering study of a small perturbation in the background of a black hole in order to get information of the stability of this object  @xcite , a problem that was continued by zerilli  @xcite .",
    "the oscillations found in these studies are not normal modes due to the emission of gravitational waves ; thus , their frequencies are complex and , as a result , the oscillations are damped .",
    "the terminology quasinormal mode ( qnm ) and quasinormal frequency ( qnf ) , aiming to name these new modes and their frequencies , was first pointed out by vishveshwara  @xcite and press  @xcite . although initially studied in black hole backgrounds , the concept of qnm applies to a much broader class of systems .",
    "the qnms of black holes were first numerically calculated by chandrasekhar and detweiler  @xcite showing that the amplitude is dominated by a ringing characteristic signal at intermediate times .",
    "the qnms are independent of the particular initial perturbation that excited them . the frequencies and damping times of the oscillations depend only on the parameters of the black hole and are , therefore , the `` footprints '' of this structure .",
    "soon , the connection of qnms to astrophysics was established by noting that their existence can lead to the detection of black holes through the observation of the gravitational wave spectrum .",
    "the interest in qnms has motivated the development of numerical and analytical techniques for their computation ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "also , the study of the quasinormal spectrum gives information about the stability aspects of black hole solutions using probe classical matter fields ( scalar , electromagnetic , spinorial ) evolving in the geometry without backreacting on the spacetime background .",
    "much has been done in that direction , not only in four dimensions @xcite@xcite , but also in two @xcite , and in more than four @xcite .    aside from the study of the stability of the solutions , the qnfs are important in the context of the gauge - gravity correspondence , whose most celebrated example is the duality between the type iia - b string theory in @xmath1 spacetime and the four - dimensional supersymmetric yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "such a correspondence can be generalized for those cases in which there is an event horizon in the gravity side . in this case",
    "the hawking temperature of the black hole is related to the temperature of a thermal field theory defined at the anti - de sitter ( ads ) boundary .",
    "also , as a consequence of the correspondence , the quasinormal spectrum corresponds to the poles of thermal green functions @xcite , more precisely , the inverse of the imaginary part of the fundamental quasinormal frequency can be interpreted as the dual field theory relaxation time @xcite .    another interesting application of qnms appears in the context of black hole thermodynamics .",
    "some decades ago bekenstein  @xcite suggested that the horizon area of a black hole must be quantized , so that the area spectrum has the form @xmath2 , with @xmath3 a dimensionless constant to be determined .",
    "the first proposal to calculate this constant through qnms was made by hod  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the real part of the asymptotic quasinormal mode can be seen as a transition frequency in the semiclassical limit , and its quantum emission causes a change in the mass of the black hole , which is related to the area . in this way , the constant @xmath3 for a schwarzschild black hole was determined as @xmath4 .",
    "later , kunstatter  @xcite repeated the calculation quantizing the adiabatic invariant @xmath5 via the bohr - sommerfeld quantization and using the real part of the qnf as the vibrational frequency .",
    "the result was exactly the same as hod s .",
    "however , recently maggiore  @xcite pointed out that qnms should be described as damped harmonic oscillators , thus , the imaginary part of the qnf should not be neglected , and the proper physical frequency is the module of the entire qnf . moreover , when considering the quantization of the adiabatic invariant , the frequency to be considered is that corresponding to a transition between two neighboring quantum levels . with this identification ,",
    "the constant @xmath3 for a schwarzschild black hole becomes @xmath6 , a result that coincides with the value calculated by other methods  @xcite .",
    "the consequences of hod s and maggiore s proposals were promptly studied in several spacetimes  @xcite .    in this paper , we are interested in the study of the stability of the @xmath0 , three - dimensional lifshitz black hole found in the context of the so - called new massive gravity ( nmg )  @xcite . moreover , as an application of our qnm results we aim to calculate the area spectrum of this black hole .",
    "nmg is a novel parity - preserving , unitary  @xcite , power - counting super - renormalizable  @xcite , three - dimensional model describing the propagation of a massive positive - energy graviton with two polarization states of helicity @xmath7 in a minkowski vacuum , whose linearized version is equivalent to the pauli - fierz theory for a massive spin-2 field in three dimensions .",
    "the action of nmg consists of a `` wrong sign '' einstein - hilbert term plus a quadratic curvature term given by a precise combination of the ricci tensor and the curvature scalar , which introduces a mass parameter  @xcite . as with other massive gravity theories ,",
    "nmg also admits black hole - type solutions with several asymptotics and additional parameters  @xcite .",
    "even though this last feature could challenge the usual einstein - hilbert gravity , it is seen that the definition of mass in this new type of black holes is a conserved charge computed from a combination of the black hole parameters , which satisfies the first law of thermodynamics .",
    "a study of qnms in these static new type of black holes has been performed in  @xcite .",
    "the black holes we take into account for our study are asymptotically lifshitz , _",
    "i.e. _ , they exhibit the anisotropic scale invariance , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the dynamical critical exponent .",
    "specifically , we deal with the solutions found for the particular case of @xmath0 and a precise value of the mass parameter  @xcite .",
    "the general class of these solutions are important in the context of gauge - gravity duality  @xcite and were also investigated in other background theories  @xcite .",
    "no stability study of black holes with lifshitz asymptotics in three dimensions in the scenario of nmg has been performed yet .",
    "we aim to give some contribution to this issue by considering the qnf of scalar and spinorial matter fields in the probe limit , _ i.e _ , there are no backreaction effects upon the asymptotically lifshitz black hole metric .",
    "spinor fields have been extensively studied in general relativity @xcite@xcite , and their quasinormal frequencies have also been considered @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the lifshitz black holes and discuss their causal structure .",
    "sections 3 and 4 are dedicated to the study of stability under scalar and spinorial perturbations with special emphasis on the massless spinor for the latter . in section 5",
    "we present the numerical analysis for both kinds of perturbations showing the qnms and the corresponding qnfs computed in each case .",
    "section 6 is devoted to the calculation of the area spectrum of these black holes as an application of our quasinormal spectrum .",
    "finally , we discuss our results and conclude in section 7 .",
    "in this section we review the black hole solutions we will consider within this paper , and we comment some of their features .",

    ", it is found that the theory exhibits special properties at the points @xmath17 .",

    "besides , the surface @xmath28 acts as a one - way membrane for physical objects as we can see from the norm of a vector @xmath29 normal to a given surface @xmath30 .",
    "since @xmath30 has to be null in order to be a one - way membrane , the norm of @xmath29 must be null as well , _",

    "first of all , we must remove the coordinate singularity at @xmath28 . rewriting the metric in terms of null",
    "coordinates @xmath37 @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the tortoise coordinate shown in the next section , we get    @xmath40    which is manifestly regular at @xmath28 .",
    "finally , to construct the penrose - carter diagram ( fig.[penrose ] ) we use the following set of null coordinates @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "is light - like and covered by a regular event horizon @xmath44.,height=302 ]    from this diagram we see that the spacetime singularity is located at @xmath27 , as previously observed from the behavior of the kretschmann invariant .",

    "in this section , we analyze the behavior of a scalar field perturbation in the background of a three - dimensional lifshitz black hole .",
    "the scalar field obeys the klein - gordon equation , @xmath45 where @xmath13 is the mass of the field @xmath46 . performing the decomposition    @xmath47",
    "the klein - gordon equation takes the form , @xmath48    even though this equation has an analytical solution , as we will see in what follows , it is also useful to check the numerical results . with this goal",
    "we further decompose @xmath49 , where the _ tortoise _ coordinate @xmath39 is given by    @xmath50 \\,.\\ ] ]    in this way the klein - gordon equation reduces to    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the scalar effective potential given by    @xmath53    now let us come back to the issue of finding an exact solution for eq.([kg3 ] ) .",
    "we set the time dependence of the field @xmath54 as @xmath55 and redefine the radial coordinate as @xmath56 .",

    "as we are looking for quasinormal frequencies with negative imaginary parts , which give stable solutions , we find that for @xmath75 we need @xmath76 .",

    "in this section , we are going to consider a spinorial field as a perturbation in the spacetime given by the three - dimensional lifshitz black hole .",

    "therefore , the quasinormal modes for @xmath144 are necessarily stable  @xcite .    the numerical results regarding the decay of the scalar field are shown in figs.[escalar_varm]-[escalar_vark ] , and the comparison between the numerical and analytical results is displayed in fig.[comparacao ] .",
    "our results reinforce the conclusion already found analytically ; the @xmath0 lifshitz black hole is stable under scalar perturbations .",

    "the asymptotic behavior of the black hole under study might play an important role in the convergence of the method .",
    "nevertheless , a general criteria for the convergence of the horowitz - hubeny method remains an open question .",

    "therefore , we see that the horizon area for the @xmath0 lifshitz black hole is quantized and equally spaced .",
    "this result would not be expected for a theory containing higher order curvature corrections since , in general , black hole solutions in such theories do not have a proportional relation between their entropy and area , and consequently , both of them ( if any ) should not be quantized with an equally spaced spectrum for large quantum numbers  @xcite .",
    "however , it was already demonstrated that the @xmath0 , three - dimensional lifshitz black hole has an entropy proportional to its horizon area  @xcite .",
    "thus , our result ( [ areasp ] ) also states that the entropy should be quantized with a spectrum evenly spaced .",
    "nevertheless , we should stress that a generalization of this result for lifshitz black holes should wait for the calculation of the area spectra of other black holes of such a type . solely these studies can give a definite answer on this subject .",
    "we have studied the stability of the three - dimensional lifshitz black hole under scalar and spinorial perturbations in the probe limit through the computation of quasinormal modes . in addition , we have found the event horizon area quantization as an application of the results for quasinormal modes using maggiore s prescription .    regarding the stability ,",
    "we have not found unstable quasinormal modes in the range of parameters that we have considered ; all the frequencies have a negative imaginary part indicating that the modes are damped and thus , the perturbations decay , leaving the system stable against this particular sort of probe fields .    in the case of a scalar probe field",
    ", such results totally agree with the analytical expressions for the quasinormal frequencies ; they show a very large imaginary part and a very small real part .",
    "these modes are almost purely imaginary .",
    "we have implemented two different numerical methods in order to obtain the quasinormal frequencies and modes : the finite difference and the horowitz - hubeny methods .",
    "the former allows us to obtain the temporal behavior of the fields showing all the stages of the decay , while the latter gives only the frequencies values .",
    "as explained in section [ numerical ] , the horowitz - hubeny method failed in the calculation of the scalar frequencies as it can be observed in fig.[comparacao ] . on the contrary , the finite difference method has a very good agreement with the analytical expression ( [ freq_analitico ] ) .",
    "apart from the numerical factor , the asymptotic scalar frequency found in the present work is the same as the one calculated in the hydrodynamic limit of the scalar perturbations in the context of gauge - gravity duality@xcite .    regarding the spinorial perturbation ,",
    "our numerical results show that the probe massless spinor decays and , thus , the @xmath0 lifshitz black hole is stable also under spinorial perturbations .    as a by - product we also obtained the area spectrum of this black hole by means of the application of maggiore s method using our results for the scalar asymptotic quasinormal frequencies .",
    "equation ( [ areasp ] ) shows that the horizon area is quantized and equally spaced .",
    "furthermore , in light of the conclusions shown in  @xcite , the corresponding entropy should also have an evenly spaced spectrum .    finally ,",
    "although we have demonstrated the stability of the @xmath0 , three - dimensional lifshitz black hole under scalar and spinor perturbations , we should stress that the definite answer on stability should come from the gravitational perturbations , in particular , from the tensor part of the metric perturbation .",
    "it is well known that einstein gravity in three dimensions has no propagating degrees of freedom , however , the massive versions of the theory , _ e.g. _ , nmg , allow the propagation of gravitational waves .",
    "albeit this subject deserves further study , the calculation of metric perturbations is a formidable task that is out of the scope of the present paper . the analysis is not dead easy because the perturbation equation is a fourth order differential equation .",
    "thus , some other techniques need to be used together with the traditional qnm analysis  @xcite .",
