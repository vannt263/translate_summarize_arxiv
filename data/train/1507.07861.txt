    "the diffusive transport of particles in a confined geometry can be effectively controlled by varying the boundary shape .",
    "this approach has been widely adopted in natural and artificial systems including channels in biological membranes , nanoporous materials , microfluidics , and artificial ion channels @xcite .",
    "a large variety of quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) structures with modulated cross - section have been developed for applications in controlled drug delivery , biochemical sensing , particle sorting , brownian motors , and ion pumps @xcite .",
    "however , this powerful method has not been extensively applied to the control of @xmath0 such as light , microwave or acoustic waves .",
    "while wave diffusion is often described by the brownian motion , it has a fundamental difference from particle diffusion , i.e. , the scattered waves interfere and produce many important phenomena in mesoscopic physics , e.g. , anderson localization , universal conductance fluctuations , and enhanced backscattering @xcite . our aim is to control the mesoscopic transport by manipulating wave interference effects in a confined geometry .    a prominent interference effect in a lossless diffusive medium is the creation of open and closed channels , which are eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the field transmission matrix ( tm ) .",
    "the transmission eigenvalues are close to 1 or 0 , leading to a bimodal distribution @xcite .",
    "the open channels ( with transmission eigenvalues @xmath3 close to 1 ) have dominant contributions to the propagation of waves through random media , while the closed channels ( @xmath4 ) determine the reflected waves .",
    "thus by modifying these channels , one would be able to control wave transport .",
    "the key question is , then , how to modify these channels .",
    "a recent study has shown that the maximum transmission channel has a universal spatial profile ( inside a diffusive waveguide with uniform cross section ) , which can not be changed by varying disorder strength or by adjusting the width or length of the random media @xcite .",
    "the wavefront shaping technique has been successfully developed for selective coupling of light into open channels to enhance the total transmission or focusing through a random medium @xcite , but it can not modify the transmission eigenchannels . therefore , an efficient method for deterministic tailoring of the spatial structure of transmission channels is still missing .    in this paper , we propose and demonstrate an effective approach to manipulate the transmission eigenchannels to control diffusive wave transport .",
    "we show that by varying the geometry of a random waveguide , the spatial structure of open channels can be significantly and deterministically altered from the universal ones .",
    "this enables tuning the depth profile of energy density inside the random medium , thus controlling how much energy is concentrated inside the sample and where it is concentrated . by gradually increasing the waveguide cross - section , we are able to convert evanescent channels to propagating channels .",
    "in addition to controlling transmission , perfect reflection channels can be created in certain confined geometries , which do not exist in waveguides with uniform cross - section .",
    "we show that , unlike high reflection channels in uniform waveguides that exhibit shallow penetration into the disordered system , a perfect reflection channel can penetrate almost through the entire system but does not transmit any light .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of absorption , we can vary the decay length of energy flux inside a diffusive waveguide by modulating the cross - section of the waveguide along its axis .",
    "this can not be achieved in a waveguide of uniform cross - section , as the flux decay length is independent of the waveguide dimension and is determined only by the intrinsic disorder and dissipation .",
    "optical absorption is ubiquitous and it often weakens the localization effects @xcite , but our approach of using geometry to control wave transport by manipulating the structure of eigenchannels proves to be effective and robust against strong absorption . therefore the confined geometries enable us to control not only the amount of light being transmitted or reflected , but also the amount of energy concentrated inside the random media .",
    "although strong localization effects , absorption or asymmetric reflection from edges can modify the universal structure of transmission channels , but such effects also remove the open channels with perfect transmission @xcite .",
    "unlike these effects , the approach of varying shape of confined geometries gives the significant advantage and freedom to alter the spatial structures of eigenchannels while retaining the open eigenchannels with perfect transmission .",
    "aside from the fundamental importance , the ability of tailoring the spatial distribution of energy density of transmission eigenchannels can be exploited to manipulate light - matter interactions in highly scattering media , e.g. , light absorption , emission , amplification , and nonlinear optical processes @xcite .",
    "the potential applications range from laser surgery , photovoltaics , to random laser and energy - efficient lighting @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that the perfect reflection channels may greatly benefit sensing and imaging applications , as the light in such a channel would penetrate to a certain depth and then fully reflected to ensure an efficient collection of the probe signal .",
    "the conversion of evanescent waves to propagative waves and vice versa may be used to tailor optical excitations inside the random media . since the application of wavefront shaping technique to focusing or imaging through turbid media as well as enhancing total transmission depends on the properties of high transmission channels , our approach of modifying the transmission eigenvalues and eigenvectors by geometry provides a complementary degree of control . while the efficiency of wavefront shaping approach is reduced by incomplete channel control and measurement noise @xcite ,",
    "our approach is immune to such external factors .",
    "although the above results are obtained for light , they are also applicable to other classical and quantum mechanical waves .",
    "to manipulate transmission eigenchannels , we design and fabricate quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) waveguides of various geometries .",
    "the waveguide structures are fabricated in a 220 nm silicon layer on top of 3 @xmath5 m buried oxide by electron beam lithography and reactive ion etching @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the scanning electron microscope ( sem ) images of two fabricated waveguides .",
    "the waveguide contains a 2d random array of air holes that serve as scatterers for light .",
    "the air hole diameter is 100 nm and the average ( center - to - center ) distance of adjacent holes is 390 nm .",
    "the waveguide walls are made of triangle lattice of air holes ( lattice constant = 440 nm , hole radius = 154 nm ) that has a complete 2d photonic bandgap for the in - plane confinement of light .",
    "the waveguide is connected to a lead which is an empty waveguide ( without any air holes ) with a constant width to couple light in .",
    "@xmath5 m to @xmath6 @xmath5 m , and in ( b ) it is opposite .",
    "both have the same length @xmath7 = 80 @xmath5 m .",

    "the light is transverse - electric ( te ) polarized , with the electric field parallel to the plane of the waveguide ( @xmath8 plane ) . after propagating through the lead ,",
    "the light is incident onto the random array of air holes and undergoes multiple scattering in the 2d plane of waveguide .",
    "some of the light is scattered out of plane , part of which is collected by a 50@xmath9 objective lens ( na = 0.42 ) and imaged onto an ingaas camera ( xeva 1.7 - 320 ) . from the optical image [ fig .",

    "ensemble averaging is done by recording the intensity profile for 50 different wavelengths around @xmath11 = 1500 nm and three distinct configurations of air holes .",
    "further averaging is done by slightly shifting the input beam spot on the lead waveguide in the transverse direction @xmath12 to produce distinct speckle illumination for the random array of air holes , nevertheless , the incident intensity profile is always kept uniform across @xmath12 .",
    "all disordered waveguides studied in this work exhibit diffusive transport .",
    "the relevant parameters for light transport in the disordered waveguide are the transport mean free path @xmath13 and the diffusive dissipation length @xmath14 .",
    "the transport mean free path @xmath13 depends on the density and diameter of the air holes .",
    "the dissipation results from out - of - plane scattering , since the silicon absorption at the probe wavelength is negligible .",
    "this vertical leakage of light can be treated similarly as absorption and described by the diffusive dissipation length @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the ballistic dissipation time and @xmath17 is the diffusion coefficient @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are 2.2 @xmath5 m and 26 @xmath5 m respectively , which were extracted from the measured intensity distribution inside a waveguide of rectangle shape @xcite . since these two parameters depend only on the size and density of the air holes , we keep them the same for all waveguides with different geometries .",
    "this ensures the modification of light transport is purely due to the change in geometry instead of structural disorder or dissipation .",
    "in fig . 1 , the two waveguides have their width @xmath18 increase or decrease linearly along the waveguide axis @xmath19 . to illustrate how the transmission channels are modified by the linear tapering of the waveguide boundary , we first perform numerical modeling by excluding the effect of dissipation .",
    "this enables us to separate the effect of geometry from that of dissipation , which will be discussed in the next section . in the simulation ,",
    "the wavelength , refractive index , and polarization of light are the same as in the experiment .",
    "however , the dimension of the waveguide and the transport mean free path are scaled down to reduce the computing time .",
    "this should not change the conclusion of our results because the systems are still in the diffusive regime .",
    "the disordered waveguide has perfectly reflecting sidewalls and is connected to two leads ( empty waveguides ) at both ends .",
    "the refractive index in the empty waveguide is determined by the vertical waveguiding in the silicon layer , and its value is calculated to be @xmath20 = 2.85 . in the disordered waveguide , the presence of air holes ( @xmath21 , radius = 75 nm , filling fraction = 0.15 ) reduces the effective index of refraction to @xmath20 = 2.62 .",
    "the ( vacuum ) wavelength of the probe light is @xmath11 = 1.5 @xmath5 m , and the transport mean free path is @xmath13 = 1.1 @xmath5 m .",
    "the length of the disordered waveguide @xmath7 is set to be much larger than @xmath13 to ensure multiple scattering and diffusion of light .",
    "since the localization length ( @xmath22 ) is proportional to the width of the waveguide ( @xmath23 ) , the value of @xmath23 is chosen to make @xmath24 so that localization effects are negligible .",
    "we calculate the electromagnetic field inside the disordered waveguide by solving the maxwell s equations using the finite difference frequency - domain method ( comsol multiphysics ) . to construct the transmission matrix @xmath2 of the disordered waveguide , we use the guided modes in the leads as the basis . the input ( output ) lead waveguide has a constant width equal to the same width @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) of the disordered waveguide at the front ( back ) end @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , and it supports @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) guided modes . thus @xmath2 is a @xmath31 matrix , and its element @xmath32 represents the field transmission from the input @xmath33-th mode to the output @xmath34-th mode . the reflection matrix is constructed in a similar way by computing the reflected waves , and its dimension is @xmath35 .",
    "a singular value decomposition of the transmission matrix @xmath2 gives @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 is a @xmath31 diagonal matrix with @xmath38 $ ] non - negative real numbers , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the eigenvalue of @xmath41 and represents the transmittance of the @xmath42 transmission eigenchannel .",
    "@xmath43 is a @xmath44 unitary matrix that maps the field in the guided modes of the input lead to the eigenchannels of the disordered waveguide , and @xmath45 is a @xmath46 unitary matrix that maps the eigenchannels to the output waveguide modes .",
    "each column of @xmath43 represents an input singular vector , whose elements are the complex coefficients for the input waveguide modes that combine to couple light into a single transmission eigenchannel .",
    "the output field of a single transmission eigenchanel is represented by the column of @xmath45 , which is called the output singular vector .",
    "similarly the reflection eigenvalues @xmath47 can be obtained by singular value decomposition of the reflection matrix @xmath48 .    for comparison",
    ", we also compute the transmission eigenchannels in the waveguide of constant width @xmath23 . for @xmath23 = 5.1 @xmath5 m ,",
    "@xmath49 = @xmath50 = 19 , and there are 19 transmission eigenchannels .",
    "figure 2(a ) plots the transmission eigenvalues , 2 of which ( @xmath51 = 18 and 19 ) are many orders of magnitude smaller than the others and are not shown as they fall below the numerical accuracy .",
    "this is because the lead waveguide has larger refractive index than the disordered waveguide and support more guided modes .",
    "the disordered waveguide can support only @xmath52 = 17 propagating modes , thus 2 of the 19 transmission channels can not propagate inside the disordered waveguide and become evanescent .",
    "light can be coupled to these two evanescent channels with the extra modes that can be supported by the input lead waveguide .",
    "therefore , the eigenchannels of the transmission matrix can be divided into two categories : propagating channels and evanescent channels .",
    "the propagating channel has a spatial structure that varies on the scale of the mean free path .",
    "the evanescent channel features an intensity decay on the order of the wavelength , which is much shorter than the mean free path , and the corresponding transmission eigenvalue is essentially zero .    a gradual increase of the waveguide width along its axis increases the number of propagating modes that can be supported inside the disordered waveguide , converting the evanescent channels to the propagating channels .",
    "this is observed , as an example , in the tapered waveguide whose width is increased from @xmath25 = 5.1 @xmath5 m at @xmath27 to @xmath26 = 10.2 @xmath5 m at @xmath28 [ fig .",
    "1(a ) ] . with @xmath53 and @xmath54 ,",

    "2(a ) ] .    figure 2(b ) shows the spatial distribution of electric field intensity inside the tapered waveguide for the 18th and 19th transmission eigenchannels which have the lowest transmittance .",
    "both these channels have been converted from evanescent channels in a constant - width waveguide with @xmath23= 5.1 @xmath5 m to propagating channels in the tapered waveguide .",
    "@xmath10 exhibits a sharp drop near the front side of the waveguide . for a quantitative analysis , the cross - section - averaged intensity , @xmath57 \\int i(y , z ) dy$ ] ,",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "2(c ) for these two channels . for comparison , @xmath58 for the @xmath59 eigenchannel is added to the plot , and it displays an exponential decay with a constant rate .",
    "in contrast , @xmath58 for the 19th eigenchannel first decays very rapidly at small @xmath60 , and then changes to a much slower decay at @xmath61 0.07 .",
    "the number of guided modes in the waveguide is @xmath62 , where @xmath18 is the waveguide width at depth @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the effective index of refraction of the disordered waveguide . as @xmath23 increases with @xmath19 , the waveguide becomes wide enough to support additional modes .",
    "for example , at @xmath61 0.07 , @xmath50 is increased from 18 to 19 , thus the 19th mode is transformed from evanescent wave to propagating wave .",
    "consequently , the decay length of @xmath58 increases from @xmath63 0.14 @xmath5 m ( comparable to @xmath64 ) to @xmath63 1.8 @xmath5 m ( much larger than @xmath64 ) .",
    "similarly , the 18th eigenchannel is transformed from evanescent to propagating at a smaller value of @xmath61 0.05 , where @xmath50 is increased from 17 to 18 .",
    "hence , this conversion can be attributed to the gradual increase of the number of propagating modes that can be supported by the tapered waveguide at different depths .",
    "if @xmath11 and @xmath20 are fixed , the spatial position ( @xmath60 ) inside the tapered waveguide where the conversion from evanescent wave to propagating wave takes place is determined by the width at that position , thus the spatial position where such conversion occurs can be easily controlled by tuning the tapering angle .",
    "the disorder strength does not affect directly the location of conversion , however , a change in the disorder strength is often accompanied by a change in the effective index of refraction @xmath20 , which would modify the conversion depth .",
    "@xmath5 m , @xmath65 @xmath5 m ) supports 19 transmission eigenchannels of which 17 are propagating channels and 2 are evanescent channels , whereas the expanding waveguide ( @xmath66 @xmath5 m , @xmath67 @xmath5 m , @xmath65 @xmath5 m ) has 19 propagating channels of higher transmittance .",

    "tapering of the waveguide width breaks the symmetry of the spatial structure of the open channel and moves the peak of @xmath58 from the center of the waveguide towards the front end .",
    "the position of the peak does not depend on the disorder strength .",
    ", width=336 ]    the increase of the waveguide width also enhances the transmittance of all other transmission eigenchannels ( albeit not as large an enhancement as the above two ) which are also propagating channels in the constant width waveguide .",
    "consequently , the dimensionless conductance @xmath69 is larger , but the number of input modes remains the same .",
    "this behavior is distinct from the constant - width waveguide , where the increase of width also enhances @xmath70 , but the number of input modes increases simultaneously requiring additional degree of control of the input field for coupling into a single eigenchannel .",
    "the waveguide with increasing width can therefore be useful for applications related to enhancing transmission through random media by wavefront shaping technique with incomplete degree of control of the input field .",
    "furthermore , the spatial profiles of open channels are modified in the tapered waveguide .",

    "2(d ) , when the tapering angle of the waveguide boundary is merely @xmath73 , the peak of the maximum transmission channel has already moved significantly from the center @xmath74 to @xmath75 .",

    "although their profiles are slightly different , the peak positions are identical .    next we investigate the disordered waveguide with linearly decreasing width , as shown in fig .",

    "1(b ) is identical to light injection from the right end of the waveguide in fig .",
    "the transmission matrix of the waveguide in fig .",
    "1(b ) , @xmath78 , is the transpose of that in fig .",
    "1(a ) , and it also supports 19 transmission eigenchannels with the same transmittance . thus the conductance @xmath70 is identical for the two waveguides in fig .",

    "how much the peak shifts from the waveguide center depends on the angle of tapering . by changing the tapering angle ,",
    "the location of the intensity peak can be tuned deterministically , as seen in fig .",
    "this result illustrates that the maximum of the energy density can be positioned to different depths inside a random system by tailoring its geometry .    while the number of the transmission eigenchannels for the two waveguides in fig .",

    "the high reflection channel of a constant - width waveguide has shallow penetration into the random medium due to a rapid intensity decay .",
    "the perfect reflection channel , however , has a much slower decay and thus a longer penetration depth .",
    "a sharp drop of its intensity near the rear end corresponds to the cutoff beyond which no light propagates .",
    "the cutoff occurs at the position where the waveguide width is just large enough to support @xmath84 modes ( where @xmath50 is the number of propagating modes in the output lead ) .",
    "since the cutoff position depends on the tapering angle of the random waveguide , both the decay length of the intensity and the cutoff position in a perfect reflection channel can be deterministically and effectively controlled by tuning the tapering angle .",
    "for example , by increasing the tapering angle we are able to increase the penetration depth by shifting the cutoff position closer to the output end , as seen in fig .",
    "since light in the perfect reflection channels can penetrate deep into the scattering system , such channels can be used for probing inside turbid media . despite of the deeper penetration , all the light exits from the input end , making the collection efficiency of probe signal @xmath85 , which is extremely useful for sensing or imaging applications .",

    "in this section , we study the effect of light dissipation , which was not included the last section .",
    "previous studies have shown that loss has a profound impact on the transmission channels .",

    "the probability density distribution of transmission eigenvalues , @xmath93 , has 2 peaks , one at 1 and the other at 0 .",

    "although it reduces the throughput , loss allows us to manipulate the spatial decay of energy flux inside the random waveguide by geometry . in the absence of loss , the net flux @xmath107 , integrated over the cross - section of the waveguide , points in the @xmath19 direction and its value is constant along @xmath19 . by tailoring the boundary shape of the waveguide , the magnitude of @xmath108 changes , but it remains invariant with @xmath19 . with the addition of loss , @xmath107 decays exponentially along @xmath19 .",
    "if the waveguide has a uniform cross - section , the decay length is determined by @xmath14 , which is independent of the waveguide width or length .",

    "to conclude , we have demonstrated an effective approach to modify transmission eigenchannels of confined disordered media . using geometry",
    ", we can change the spatial profiles of the transmission channels significantly and deterministically from the universal one .",
    "it allows us to control the depth profile of the total energy as well as the energy density inside the random medium , thus controlling how much energy is concentrated inside the sample and where it is concentrated .",
    "the ability to tailor the spatial distribution of energy density can be exploited to manipulate light - matter interactions in scattering media , which will be useful for numerous applications .    by gradually increasing the cross - section",
    ", we can enhance the transmittance of all the transmission eigenchannels while keeping the number of input modes the same .",
    "such geometries can be useful for applications related to enhancement of total transmission by shaping the input wavefront , as in such structures there will be more open channels due to larger conductance .",
    "moreover , since the waveguide cross - section at the input end does not change , the number of input channels remains the same , and additional degree of control of the input field is not necessary for coupling into any one of the open channels .",
    "in addition , using geometry we can also convert evanescent channels to propagating channels and vice versa . in a waveguide with the output cross - section smaller than the input one , perfectly reflecting channels are created .",
    "the light injected to such a channel would penetrate inside the scattering media to a certain depth and then get fully reflected back to the input end .",
    "the penetration depth of such channels can be further tuned by geometry .",
    "such channels have potential applications for probing deep inside turbid media . since all the light exits from the input end , the collection efficiency of probe signal would be @xmath85 .",
    "we can further design geometries with opposite taperings to have the same transmission eigenvalues but very different eigenchannel profiles . by breaking the reflection symmetry of confined geometry ,",
    "the transmission eigenchannels become asymmetric . in the presence of dissipation",
    ", the decay of energy flux inside the diffusive waveguide can be changed by modulating the cross - section of the waveguide along its axis . in a diffusive waveguide with non - monotonic tapering boundary such as the lantern geometry , energy can buildup inside the random medium , which will benefit the applications of energy harvesting and tailoring of optical excitations inside scattering media .",
    "unlike the localization effects which are suppressed by absorption , our approach of using geometry to control light transport is effective even in the presence of strong absorption and does not require any change of structural disorder .",
    "thus this approach can truly complement the wavefront shaping technique to control mesoscopic transport of light with an additional advantage that the efficiency is not reduced by external factors such as incomplete channel control and measurement noise @xcite .",
    "the results discussed in this paper are also applicable to other waves such as microwaves , acoustics or matter waves .",
    "finally , we stress that the confined geometry enables manipulating the spatial structures of transmission eigenchannels while retaining the open channels with perfect transmission .",
    "this is advantageous compared to other approaches that rely on strong localization effects , absorption @xcite or asymmetric surface reflections from edges @xcite to modify the transmission channels as those approaches will also remove the open channels with perfect transmission .",
    "although in this paper we have focused only on the maximum transmission channel , in general using geometry the spatial profiles of the other low transmission channels can also be deterministically and significantly modified .",
    "since changing the confined geometry of a random medium corresponds to modifying its boundary condition , we expect that the green s function inside the random system can also be tailored .",
    "this implies that our approach of manipulating geometry may be applied to control various mesoscopic effects that depend on the green s functions inside the random media such as non - local intensity correlations , renormalization of the diffusion coefficient , the density of states etc .",
