    "the mass sheet degeneracy ( falco , gorenstein , & shapiro 1985 ; schneider & seitz 1995 ) constitutes one of the fundamental uncertainties in attempts at reconstructing galaxy cluster masses from the gravitational distortion of resolved background sources .",
    "it arises because the observed gravitational shear field is insensitive to magnification .",
    "a few methods were proposed to break the degeneracy by directly measuring either the magnification or the ( scaled ) surface mass density .",
    "broadhurst , taylor , & peacock ( 1995 ) suggested to compare the redshift and/or the magnitude distribution of the background sources in cluster fields with those measured in empty fields .",
    "kaiser ( 1995 ) and kneib ( 1995 ) showed that inferring the mean source redshift at a given apparent magnitude can help to break the degeneracy .",
    "bartelmann & narayan ( 1995 ) proposed and tested an algorithm that exploits the size distribution of the background sources and the conservation of surface brightness under gravitational lensing .",
    "an alternative cluster reconstruction technique suggested by bartelmann ( 1996 ) breaks the mass sheet degeneracy by simultaneously taking sizes _ and _ shapes of background galaxies into account .",
    "all these methods rest upon statistical information on intrinsic background galaxy sizes .",
    "they require accurate measurements of sizes and magnitudes or surface brightnesses of lensed galaxies . in principle , a single sufficiently precise measurement of the magnification of a standard candle by a cluster can lift the mass sheet degeneracy as well .",
    "suppose a standard candle is observed behind a lens , and its redshift is measured .",
    "assuming a cosmological model , the luminosity distance is known . the apparent magnitude expected from its luminosity",
    "can then be compared to the observed one , and any discrepancy between the two can be attributed to the magnification by the foreground lens .",
    "ideal standard candles are rare in cosmology .",
    "nevertheless , there is accumulating strong evidence that sn ia may well serve as approximate standard candles , especially if one takes the dependence of their peak magnitude on the light curve shape into account ( phillips 1993 ; riess , press , & kirshner 1995 ( rpk1 ) ; riess , press , & kirshner 1996 ( rpk2 ) ; hamuy 1996a ) .",
    "moreover , sn ia are ubiquitous , point - like sources , their distinct spectral lines allow for an accurate redshift determination , and as of yet they show no cosmological evolution . though rare in frequency ,",
    "each of their aforementioned characteristics makes sn ia excellent probes for the integrated matter density along their lines - of - sight , and the composition of the matter ( its graininess , occurrence of machos etc . ) .",
    "weak lensing by large - scale structure was shown to not significantly affect the sn magnitude ( frieman 1996 ; wambsganss 1996 ) , but this does not apply to galaxy clusters .",
    "similar arguments led kovner & paczyski ( 1988 ) to propose a possible identification of sne in giant arcs as a tool to establish the time delay between different images .",
    "giant arcs are less appealing than weak lensing by clusters because they are much more rare , and sensitive to the details of the density profile close to the cluster core .",
    "soucail & fort ( 1991 ) suggested the combination of giant arcs and a much less accurate `` standard candle '' , viz .  the tully - fisher relation , to estimate the hubble constant .",
    "this method suffers from several difficulties , a possible cosmological evolution of the tully - fisher relation , and the problematic determination of the inclination angle of the lensed galaxy .    in the rest of this paper",
    ", we present the basic considerations one has to take into account in order to employ sn ia for these purposes . in  [ sec : sn_cl ] we review the necessary facts about the sn population and the cluster model we use . in  [ sec : esti ] we estimate the number of expected sn in the background of a cluster , whose luminosity  distance mismatch is large enough to allow for the removal of the mass sheet degeneracy . in ",
    "[ sec : machos ] we discuss the use of a lensed sn ia as a probe for machos in the intracluster medium .",
    "we conclude with our results in  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the distribution of absolute peak magnitudes of sn ia is intrinsically narrow ( see branch & tammann 1992 for a review ) . from the hamuy ( 1996a ,",
    "b ) sample , we find the average absolute magnitude and its standard deviation to be @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , for @xmath13 in the b , v , and i bands , respectively is the absolute blue peak magnitude . ] .",
    "the quoted standard deviation is larger than the intrinsic one , since hamuy did not correct for reddening due to dust in the host galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : dis_sn]a shows the absolute - magnitude distribution of the sample .",
    "these results are in accord with branch & miller ( 1993 ) [ ( @xmath14 in b ] , and vaughan et al .",
    "( 1995 ) [ ( @xmath15 for a sub - sample ] .",
    "the latter two results were obtained by cross - comparison with other distance indicators , that are only available for relatively nearby galaxies .",
    "the results may therefore suffer from the intrinsic scatter in these other distance indicators .",
    "the hamuy ( 1996a ) sample includes distant galaxies ( up to @xmath16 ) whose redshift provides a good enough distance estimate .",
    "a substantial decrease in the scatter of the peak luminosity distribution is achieved if a correction that is based on the shape of the light curve ( lcs ) is applied in different bands ( phillips 1993 ; rpk1 , rpk2 , hamuy 1996a ) .",
    "this can also account for reddening due to dust in the host galaxy , the milky way , and possibly in the foreground cluster .",
    "after the correction , sn ia can be regarded as standard candles up to a small dispersion of @xmath17 .",
    "a parameter that is traditionally taken to govern the lcs is the decline in b magnitude 15 rest - frame days after maximum light , @xmath18 . according to the hamuy ( 1996a ) data",
    ", its distribution has a mean and standard deviation of @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : dis_sn]b shows the distribution of the rest - frame @xmath20 from the 29 hamuy ( 1996a ) sne .",
    "the small dispersion in @xmath20 is a reflection of similar timescales for the rise and decline of the light curves of different sn . in ",
    "[ subsec : rate ] we shall use a rise time of 5 rest - frame days .",
    "this corresponds to a magnitude difference of about @xmath21 .",
    "0.5truecm = 2.7 in 2truecm = 2.7 in -0.5truecm    the specific rate of sne ia , @xmath22 , ( measured in snu : sn per @xmath23 per century ) shows a rise with redshift .",
    "the local specific rate , @xmath24 , is estimated to lie between @xmath25 and @xmath26 snu , depending on the host galaxy type ( cappellaro 1993a , 1993b ; turatto , cappellaro , & benetti 1994 ; van den bergh & mcclure 1994 ; muller 1992 ) . the average rate at @xmath27 is estimated to be @xmath28 snu ( pain 1996 ) .",
    "the rate evolution may depend on galaxy evolution , the stellar mass function , different composition of late and early type galaxies at different redshifts , and a different fraction of massive blue stars that undergo a sn ia phase .    even though the evidence for a rise with redshift is still inconclusive , all of these dependencies lead to an increment of the average specific rate of sn ia with redshift .",
    "hamuy ( 1995 ) suggest that galaxies with younger stellar population produce the most luminous sne .",
    "branch , romanishin , & baron ( 1996 ) argue that sne ia preferentially reside in late type spirals .",
    "it is hence natural to expect a higher average specific rate of sn ia at higher redshifts .",
    "all theoretical and observationally motivated models for cluster density profiles agree on its parametric shape ( @xmath29 ) at intermediate radii ( @xmath30 ) between its core and outskirts ( gunn & gott 1972 ; filmore & goldreich 1984 ; bertschinger 1985 ; hoffman 1988 ) .",
    "mass profiles obtained from weak lensing corroborate this parametric form for a few specific cluster examples ( tyson & fischer 1995 ) .",
    "n - body simulations show a similar behavior ( navarro , frenk , & white 1996 ) .",
    "we hence use a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) as our cluster model , a density profile of @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion .",
    "cluster cores , if they exist , are of size @xmath33kpc , beyond which the cluster profile resembles the sis profile .",
    "note that this is the scale where weak lensing starts to serve as a tool for deriving the cluster density profile , and thus where the mass - sheet degeneracy comes in .",
    "since most sn ia lensed by clusters are expected to be found at radii larger than the core , the approximation of a sis profile is good enough for our purposes . at the other end , we are limited by the minimal magnification for a mismatch identification .",
    "this requirement sets the outer radius of interest .",

    "the cross section for sources that are magnified by more than @xmath44 by a sis foreground lens is @xmath45 hence , magnifications @xmath46 are distributed according to @xmath47 where the second expression follows from the normalization @xmath48",
    "we model the quality of the sn to serve as standard candles in terms of the natural width , @xmath49 , of the lcs  magnitude  distance relation .",
    "the magnification by a cluster boosts the apparent magnitude by @xmath50 .",
    "if the boost is large enough , a mismatch between the sn apparent magnitude ( corrected by the lcs ) and its luminosity distance will show up .",
    "the luminosity distance is calculated from the sn redshift , given the cosmological parameters ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , ( @xmath53 ) and @xmath54 ) .",
    "the closer the sn is to the cluster center , the larger is the magnification @xmath55 , and the more pronounced is the discrepancy .",
    "the boost allows to observe sources that without the presence of the lens would fall below the detection flux limit .",
    "a competing effect of the lens is the reduction of the surface number density of background sources by @xmath56 .",
    "the bigger the cluster appears on the sky , the more background galaxies it encompasses , and thus the more potential sne .",
    "this geometrical effect must be combined with the competing @xmath57 term in the magnification ( eq . [ eq : a_sis ] ) .",
    "we assume all sne reside in galaxies .",
    "we do not distinguish between early and late type galaxies , as sn ia occur in both , though there is an indication that sne are more frequent in late - type galaxies ( cappellaro 1997 ) .",
    "the relevant function one needs to know is thus @xmath58 , the number density of galaxies at redshift @xmath59 , and their luminosity distribution .",
    "it is also essential to know what the average number of sne is for these galaxies at a given redshift .",
    "if the rest - frame blue luminosity function of galaxies at the relevant redshift is known , we may adopt a value for the specific sn rate , @xmath22 , and obtain the sn ia average rate per proper time unit per comoving volume unit from @xmath60 with @xmath61 the schechter luminosity function at redshift @xmath59 (  [ sub_sec : ng_of_z ] ) . for this calculation",

    "we take the survey magnitude limit for sn identification ( as opposed to the follow - up ) to be @xmath100 .",

    "the threshold detection magnitude is expressed by @xmath102 , the difference between the peak magnitude and the identification magnitude we require .",
    "the factor @xmath103 accounts for the cosmological time dilation .",
    "as mentioned above , we neglect a possible fainter image in our calculation .",
    "a few comments have to be made regarding expression [ eq : rate ] . to begin with",
    ", we have neglected the redshift dependence of @xmath104 ( which propagates to @xmath86 ) , albeit we use a relatively low redshift ( @xmath27 ) for it .",
    "this is in spite of the expected ( and observed ) increase of the specific rate with redshift .",
    "even a mild increase reflects strongly in the expected rate .",
    "another comment on expression ( [ eq : rate ] ) regards the k - correction . strictly speaking ,",
    "since we integrated over @xmath105 for rest - frame blue magnitude , a k - correction will shift sne into a different observed band for each redshift , and thus also to different apparent magnitude ( because of different zero points for different magnitudes ) .",
    "we did not include the k - correction for three reasons :    1 .   the k - correction for sne of redshift higher than @xmath106 has not yet been calculated ( kim , goobar , & perlmutter 1996 ) .",
    "the k - correction at @xmath107 generally translates an apparent magnitude limit in b ( say 26 ) to be smaller in r and i ( say 2525.5 ) .",
    "the signal - to - noise in r or i , though , decreases as well and therefore requires longer integration time .",
    "as goobar & perlmutter ( 1995 ) pointed out , when one goes to higher redshift , the optimal filter is selected accordingly .",
    "perlmutter ( 1995 ) suggest that a more robust procedure ( than k - correction ) is to compare the lc in the band equivalent to the rest - frame b band .    in general ,",
    "thus , all the apparent b magnitude limits we quote are higher than the required magnitude limits if observations are carried out in the appropriate bands ( but recall that the signal - to - noise decreases in r and i ) .",
    "we model the absolute magnitude distribution of the sne ia ( @xmath108 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate ] ) ) as a @xmath109-function in peak absolute magnitude .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ fig : dis_sn]a , the observed distribution is narrow , and slightly skewed .",
    "there is higher probability to find brighter - than - average absolute magnitudes than dimmer - than - average . by using a @xmath109-function at the average , @xmath110",
    ", we underestimate the observed rate predicted by eq .",

[ eq : sn_in_vol ] ) , we calculate expression ( [ eq : rate_d ] ) in order to find the expected rate of observed sne with luminosity  distance mismatch behind a cluster .",
    "we choose the cosmological parameters ( @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 ) .",
    "we require a typical sn to be found about 5 ( rest - frame ) days prior to peak luminosity . this is equivalent to @xmath117 of @xmath118 magnitudes .",
    "we assume a natural scatter in the lcs - luminosity relation of @xmath119 ( rpk2 ) , and decide how many @xmath120 away from the average relation we would like a sn to be detected in order to claim a mismatch .",
    "this value for @xmath49 may be too optimistic for existing lcs methods . in principle , however , it is achievable especially if outlier sn are easyly identified and eliminated .",
    "figure [ fig : rate ] shows the expected rate for _ detectable _ sne behind a cluster at different redshifts .",
    "we choose @xmath121 for the cluster velocity dispersion .",
    "the different curves correspond to different magnitude limits for the sn detection .",
    "recall that these limits are a direct translation from the rest - frame b band to the actual observed bands , where one expects the limit to be @xmath122 magnitudes lower ( because of the zero - point shift ) .",
    "the integration over @xmath59 is carried out only up to @xmath123 to achieve agreement with the observed surface number density , and in order not to extrapolate the redshift dependence of the galaxy number density too far .",
    "since we did not include k - correction in our calculation , we do not specify the band of the magnitude limit . as was pointed out by goobar & perlmutter ( 1995 ) ,",
    "it is probably the i filter that is most suitable for @xmath124 sn detection and the i , j filters for sne of @xmath125 .",
    "increasing the magnitude limit beyond @xmath126 does not yield a higher rate because of the cutoff in the source redshift .",
    "the rate drops monotonically with lens redshift because the einstein angle of a sis is almost independent of lens redshift as long as @xmath127 .",
    "the redshift dependence of the rate is thus determined by the volume behind the lens that is spanned by the almost constant angular cross section of the cluster .    -2.0truecm",
    "3.6truecm = 3.7 in -1.0truecm    figure [ fig : rate ] indicates that if all lmc - like galaxies ( @xmath128 for @xmath129 ) host sne with the same average specific rate as observed at @xmath27 ( the contribution of galaxies dimmer than @xmath130 to @xmath86 is small ) , then we can expect to observe 1 - 2 sne behind each nearby cluster each year .",
    "since most sne will be at higher redshift , the cosmic time dilation reduces the expected rate ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : rate ] , [ eq : rate_d ] ) but at the same time widens the time window to catch the sn while its lc is rising . the necessary duration for the sn identification survey is therefore _ not _ inversely proportional to the ratio between the local and high-@xmath59 expected rate .",
    "if a mismatch of @xmath49 is found for a background sn , one has to decide what is the permitted range of variation for the sn absolute magnitude ( recall the magnitude probability is asymmetric , fig . [",
    "fig : dis_sn]a ) . for a permitted range of @xmath131 , and a @xmath93 mismatch detection , the lower and upper limits for the magnification",

    "the significance of these limits is much increased when combined with other reconstruction methods ( kaiser & squires 1993 ; squires & kaiser 1996 ; schneider & seitz 1995 ; seitz & schneider 1995 , 1996 , 1997 ; bartelmann 1996 ) .",
    "being a point source , the sn probes a single line - of - sight that intersects the cluster .",
    "inferring limits on the cluster mass from limits on @xmath55 may bear two caveats ; if the sn line - of - sight happens to pass near a cluster galaxy , the galaxy adds to the magnification , and the simple interpretation of the limits on @xmath55 in terms of limits on the cluster mass is no longer valid .",
    "barring dramatic magnification bias , the two - dimensional filling factor of galactic critical curves beyond @xmath38 is very small , and therefore the galaxy contributions can generally be ignored .",
    "a similar contribution to the magnification may arise due to intervening low mass objects ( intracluster machos ) .",
    "we discuss this possibility in the next section .",
    "the requirement for high enough a magnification in order to identify a mismatch in the luminosity - distance relation is essential only if we like to remove the mass sheet degeneracy .",
    "however , even if a sn is observed at radii larger than @xmath135 , it is still very useful as a point - like probe for the dense environment of the cluster . the spectral line identification , and",
    "the family of lcss , allow for an identification of many possible modulations of the light curve .",
    "the main source for such modulations are compact objects in the intracluster medium which induce microlensing events on top of the cluster magnification .",
    "the einstein radius of a point mass @xmath136 is @xmath137 @xmath138 is the effective lensing distance , with @xmath139 the angular diameter distance to the lens , the source , and between lens and source , respectively .",

    "the time scale @xmath143 of a sn ia at redshift @xmath144 is of order 100 days . even for higher redshifts ,",
    "this is the maximum relevant time - scale ( half a year ) due to observational constraints .",
    "the microlensing time scale @xmath145 is therefore compatible with @xmath146 only for very small microlens masses , @xmath147 .",
    "the time scale may be shorter due to the expansion of the sn photosphere .",
    "an estimate for this limit is obtained by requiring that the angular size of the sn not exceed that of the einstein radius . for a rest - frame expansion rate of @xmath148 cm s@xmath88 , the angular size of the sn photosphere at",

    "the rest of the detected sn can be combined together for the same purpose .",
    "since the magnification scales like @xmath198 and the number of sources scales like @xmath199 ( neglecting magnification bias ) , we expect the signal - to - noise ratio to be constant . statistical use of the sne on large radii yields a similar signal - to - noise ratio as for the sne that exceeded the mismatch threshold .",
    "any of the detected sn can serve as a point source with a typical light curve shape . any modulation of this light curve shape , or lack thereof , can put limits on the mass fraction of the cluster in the form of @xmath200 machos .",
    "this proposed survey shifts the focus from high redshift clusters as targets for high redshift sne to low redshift clusters as foreground lenses for the same , and farther sne . at the same time , the nearby observed cluster enhances the probability of finding serendipitous sne in it .",
    "the use of the cluster sne as point sources for macho search is somewhat less efficient because of the relatively small effective lensing distance @xmath201 , and the unknown position of the source within the cluster .",
    "the monitoring procedure of current observations will have to be modified , namely to allow for longer gaps between successive observations of the same cluster , but more observations in total during the year .",
    "the proposal demands a higher magnitude limit than the values that are currently used , both for the identification and for the follow - up .",
    "these limits , however , are not out of reach .      1",
    ".   we do not take into account the fainter image when multiple images appear on the image plane .",
    "we took the specific sn ia rate at @xmath27 and used it as the representative value for higher redshifts despite the prediction of increasing rate with redshift .",
    "we choose a @xmath109-function to represent the probability distribution of the sn absolute blue magnitude .",
    "the @xmath109-function is centered on the mean , even though the median of the distribution seems to be on the bright side . on the other hand ,",
    "note we have ignored a possible malmquist bias in the hamuy ( 1996a ) sample , a bias that tends to slightly shift the average towards brighter magnitudes . 4 .",
    "we considered only sne that exceed the detection ( magnitude limit ) threshold @xmath202 days ( rest - frame ) prior to peak luminosity .",
    "a weaker requirement ( only @xmath203 magnitudes below peak ) may suffice if a denser time sampling is devised , or if the sn is intrinsically more luminous than average ( and therefore rises and declines more slowly ) .",
    "we require a mismatch of twice the natural scatter in the lcs - luminosity relationship .",
    "a more modest requirement may be sufficient to establish limits on the surface mass density along the line - of - sight .",
    "we only integrate in redshift up to @xmath123 because of lack of knowledge of the number density of galaxies beyond this range .",
    "note that if we are not willing to extrapolate the galaxy number density beyond @xmath204 , but we still like to satisfy the observed surface number density of galaxies , the number density should rise even more steeply than assumed beyond @xmath67 .",
    "if this is the case , more sn ia fall under the magnitude limit of the survey , and the rate increases correspondingly .",
    "it seems that the main challenge for this proposed method is the high accuracy photometry needed .",

    "stromolo , australia ( schmidt 1996 ) ) .",
    "one survey fits this paper proposal if higher magnitude limits are applied ( abell cluster sn search , university of washington ) .",
    "these surveys objective is generally quite different from the investigation of galaxy clusters ( nevertheless , we have just heard that the sn cosmology project intend to propose a survey in the spirit of this paper ) .",
    "the expertise they have acquired for determining the value of the cosmological background parameters should serve them well in pursuing the nature and distribution of matter within this background .",
