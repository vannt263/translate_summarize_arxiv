    "the rate of dissociation of h@xmath16 by electron impact with lte vibrational population is taken into account ( stibbe & tennyson 1999 ) .",
    "although these lte reaction rates are over - estimates for h@xmath16 dissociation , there is no significant difference between models with and without collisional dissociation .",
    "h@xmath16 forms after the gas layer collapses , because the timescale of h@xmath16 formation is much larger than cooling timescale .",
    "the temperature in collapsed layer is too low for h@xmath16 to dissociate by collision .",
    "this is why collisional dissociation is ineffective in our models .",
    "we adopt the rate of photodissociation from th85 , @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the probability that photons of the interstellar radiation field penetrate to optical depth @xmath141 in a plane parallel cloud layer . photodissociating uv fields",

    "the rate at which cosmic rays destroy h@xmath16 is estimated by hm89 to be 2.29@xmath145 , where @xmath145 is the primary cosmic - ray ionization rate for atomic hydrogen .",
    "we include a simplified treatment of the conversion of singly ionized carbon c@xmath146 to carbon monoxide co following langer ( 1976 ) and nelson & langer ( 1997 ) .",
    "the simplified chemical model assumes the direct conversion of c@xmath147 to co , or vice versa , without accounting explicitly for the intermediate reactions .",

    "field ( 1965 ) analyzed the stability of uniform gas in thermal equilibrium .",
    "schwarz et al . ( 1972 ) analyzed the isochorically cooling gas without heating .",
    "our non - linear calculation , however , shows that the shock - compressed layer is almost isobaric . in this appendix",

    "coordinate @xmath162 , @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the contraction parameter . in these contracting coordinates",
    ", the velocity field can be written as @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the perturbed velocity relative to the contraction .            if we set the perturbed velocity @xmath166 equals to zero in the above equations , the equations governing isobarically contracting background are @xmath172 equation [ eq : eoc-0 ] leads @xmath173 .",
    "temperature is proportional to @xmath174 because unperturbed gas is isobaric . from equation [ eq : eoe-0 ]",
    ", we obtain the approximate solution for @xmath164 as @xmath175 where @xmath176 is a net cooling time defined by @xmath177 .",
    "this approximation is valid as far as variations of density and temperature remain small , i.e. @xmath178 . equation [ eq : eom-0 ] gives @xmath179 .",
    "thus , we consider uniform unperturbed state , @xmath180 .",
    "the isobarically cooling gas is characterized by a temperature @xmath181 and a number density @xmath182 which are functions of time , while the pressure @xmath183 is constant .                  where @xmath192 @xmath193 @xmath194 @xmath195 @xmath196 @xmath197 we adopt the collision mean free path , @xmath198 , instead of thermal conduction coefficient @xmath199 .",
