    "frank ruskey and carla savage in 1993 formulated the following problem @xcite : does every matching in a hypercube extend to a hamiltonian cycle ?",
    "more than two decades have passed and the question still remains open .",
    "it may be of interest that a complementary problem on the existence of a hamiltonian cycle avoiding a given matching in a hypercube has been already resolved @xcite .",
    "an important step towards a solution to the ruskey - savage problem was made in 2007 by fink who answered the question affirmatively for every perfect matching @xcite .",
    "note that this implies a  positive solution for every matching that extends to a perfect one , which includes e.g.  every induced matching @xcite .",
    "however , this result does not immediately provide a  complete answer to the original question , as hypercubes contain matchings that are maximal with respect to inclusion , but still not perfect . actually , to determine the minimum size of such a matching is another long - standing problem @xcite .",
    "the simplicity and elegance of fink s method inspired several generalizations @xcite , but none of them addresses the extendability of imperfect matchings .    as far as arbitrary matchings are concerned , there are only partial results that deal with matchings of linear size .",
    "the author of the current paper showed that a set @xmath3 of at most @xmath4 edges of the @xmath1-dimensional hypercube extends to a hamiltonian cycle iff @xmath3 induces a linear forest @xcite .",
    "this bound is sharp , as for every @xmath5 there is a non - extendable linear forest of @xmath6 edges @xcite . of course",
    ", these edges do not form a matching , so this does not imply a negative answer to the ruskey - savage problem . in the case when @xmath3 is a matching , the bound on @xmath7 was improved to @xmath8 by wang and zhang @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to derive a quadratic upper bound on the size of a  matching that extends to a cycle which covers at least @xmath2 of the vertices of the hypercube .",
    "our result is based on an inductive construction which combines a refinement of fink s method for perfect matchings @xcite with a lemma on hypercube partitioning due to wiener @xcite .",
