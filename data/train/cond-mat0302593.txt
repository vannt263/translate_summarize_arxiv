    "tsallis statistics , first proposed 14 years ago @xcite , is a field which attracts great attention nowadays .",
    "it has been applied to a variety of fields , among which are included : fully developed turbulence @xcite , anomalous diffusion @xcite , and the nos - hoover thermostat @xcite . + certainly , many proposals to explain its physical meaning , in particular the interpretation of the generalization parameter @xmath0 , have risen . some of them @xcite suggest that @xmath0 measures the fluctuation of a quantity pertaining the phenomenom in which the interpretation was proposed . + we follow the path initially proposed by plastino and plastino @xcite , and almeida @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the idea that tsallis power law canonical distribution is the probability function of a system which is in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath which has a _ finite number of degrees of freedom _ , and the quantity @xmath1 is the exponent of the energy in the accessible phase space volume of the @xmath2-th system which is proportional to the number of degrees of freedom of this system",
    ". it may either be positive or negative .",
    "+ it should be noticed that in this formalism the distribution is obtained in the first place ( instead of postulating an entropy functional and then finding the canonical form by optimization of the former ) from the system s phase space geometry .",
    "+ of course , this is only one case where tsallis statistics can be said to `` apply '' , since the generalization parameter @xmath0 , firstly free of interpretation , provides a very convenient way of describing a wide class of phenomena .",
    "henceforth , we will refer to our framework as the finite bath canonical ensemble , but still use the notation introduced previously .",
    "any quantities labeled by @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 belong to the composite ( observable+bath ) , observable , and heat bath system . +",
    "many theoretical developments were achieved along this line @xcite . also , a few simulations were performed in order to test the present approach @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the finite heat bath canonical ensemble may be found within these references .",
    "+ we propose here to simulate two simple systems in order to measure the square relative fluctuation ( srf ) of a system .",
    "we want to test the result found in @xcite .",
    "we do this by using a procedure in which we separate the degrees of freedom of a classical system , which is not is thermal contact with any heat bath , and define one of them as the observable system , and the other as the bath .",
    "this was primarly used in @xcite .",
    "+ we organize the paper as follows : in section 2 , we give a brief explanation of the relative fluctuation calculation made in @xcite .",
    "section 3 is devoted to introduce the model , the systems , and the simulations results . in section 4",
    "we discuss the physical meaning of this approach . in section 5",
    "we address our conclusions .",
    "in order to calculate the srf of a random quantity @xmath6 , we need to calculate the following expression : @xmath7 the angular brackets denote ensemble averages . + in @xcite ,",
    "the authors calculated equation ( [ x - relfluct ] ) for a system s energy @xmath8 .",
    "this energy is distributed according to the following power law canonical distribution : @xmath9^{\\frac{1}{q_2 - 1}},\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the partition function , the parameter @xmath11 satisfies : @xmath12 @xmath8 and @xmath13 are the observable and total energies .",
    "equation ( [ tsallis - function ] ) is just another way of writing the distribtuion function of a system in contact with a finite heat bath , therefore , it is not , from the very beginning , a distribution which arises due to the presence of unusual characteristics , such as long - range interactions .",
    "all the moments of @xmath8 were calculated in @xcite , and equation ( [ x - relfluct ] ) was written as : @xmath14 where : @xmath15 this expression is nothing less than the additivity of the exponents of the allowed phase space volumes of the three systems .",
    "+ the temperature of a system was defined in @xcite , through the equipartition theorem , and is given by : @xmath16 it may seem confusing the 3 @xmath0 s introduced above , one for each system , since the whole non - extensive statistics was primarily based on a single parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this approach necessarily leads us to the 3 @xmath0 s , since each system has its own phase space , and therefore , characterized by its own @xmath0 .",
    "fortunately , only one is really important , namely @xmath17 .",
    "this is the number which characterizes the distribution function of the observable system , and if this @xmath0 goes to @xmath4 , inother words , if the number of degrees of freedom of the bath goes to infinity , the distribution ( [ tsallis - function ] ) goes to the boltzmann - gibbs ( @xmath18 ) exponential , and the whole formalism , to the classical @xmath18 one .",
    "+ the simulation performed here intend to test the validity and accuracy of ( [ e1-relfluct ] ) .",
    "the results are presented in the next section .",
    "the idea here is as follows : suppose we have a system of @xmath19 particles in @xmath20 dimensions isolated from any other kind of interaction , which means that it is not coupled to an external bath .",
    "it has the following hamiltonian : @xmath21 where the first term in the right is the kinetic energy .",
    "the other two represent the potential part .",
    "note that there may be an interaction term in this system .",
    "then we pick one degree of freedom , say @xmath22 , and separate it from the rest of the hamiltonian : @xmath23 now we consider @xmath22 as our observable system and the rest of the original hamiltonian as the heat bath .",
    "since the number of degrees of freedom of @xmath8 is finite , in this case equals to @xmath24 , provided that @xmath25 is finite , the distribution of @xmath8 , or equivalently @xmath22 , is always a power law , and the results found in references @xcite can be tested .",
    "+ although it seems to be very simple to work in this approach , it should be employed very carefully .",
    "some cases are not direct as they seem to be , we must take into account the mixing of the coordinates .",
    "+ a great example is provided by the three dimensional harmonic oscillator , where @xmath26 . in this system",
    "we have three momenta and three positions .",
    "hence , it is tempting to use equation ( [ e1-relfluct ] ) to @xmath22 considering all the other degrees of freedom as the heat bath . in this case",
    "we would have the following numbers : @xmath27 these are not correct by the fact that @xmath22 only trades energy with its correspondent position @xmath28 , the other coordinates @xmath29 do not participate as a bath . in this case , the correct quantities are : @xmath30 for this reason , we can not consider the sum of any momenta as a system , for it will not span the whole allowed phase space .",
    "therefore , it is not ergodic .",
    "+ in a system which @xmath31 , all coordinates trade energy among themselves , and the bath for a single , or more , degree of freedom is defined by the rest of the coordinates .",
    "our second simulation is one of this case .",
    "when the system is coupled to an external bath , this carefullness is not needed since this interaction makes all the degrees of freedom to span the whole allowed phase space . +",
    "this approach was inspired by khinchin @xcite who suggested that degrees of freedom could be separated as a system and bath .",
    "+ thus , the simulations we present here do not describe a physical particle .",
    "they describes only a degree of freedom of a system .",
    "+      the first system to be simulated is , perhaps , the simplest one to consider .",
    "its hamiltonian reads : @xmath32 we take @xmath8 as the kinetic part , and the bath as the potential term .",
    "the values of @xmath0 for this problem are given in ( [ q - values ] ) .",
    "we notice that this is a symmetric situation , in the sense that if we choose the potential part as the observable system , the results will be the same .",
    "the srf for this system reads : @xmath33 the result of the simulations is presented in figure 1 .",
    "it should be noticed that the srf does not deviate much from the predicted value .",
    "+    as a by product of the simulation , we present , in figure 3 , the fit for the distribution of @xmath8 .",
    "the slope values @xmath34 . theoretically predicted value is given by the power of the structure function of the momentum : @xmath35    in this simulation , we have taken the following values for the important parameters : mass : @xmath36 , elastic constant : @xmath37 , time step : @xmath38 .",
    "the data for building the fit of the distribution were taken after the thermalization time was achieved .",
    "we estimated it at about : @xmath39 .",
    "we did this by observing the time evolution of @xmath40 , where @xmath41 represents the canonical variables , @xmath42 is proportional to the ratio @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the composed system s accessible volume and @xmath45 is its structure function , and is given by : @xmath46 and the overbar denotes time average .",
    "we test the approach of it to unity , for this can be a good estimate of the thermalization time of the system .",
    "+ we used a leapfrog routine to integrate the system .",
    "+      this system was inspired by the fermi - pasta - ulam model , and was first studied in @xcite .",
    "its hamiltonian is given by : @xmath47,\\ ] ] where @xmath48 denote the momentum and position of an oscillator , and @xmath19 is the total number of oscillators .",
    "+ first we will measure the srf of the kinetic energy of the first oscillator .",
    "we choose @xmath49.\\ ] ] from a simple scaling argument @xcite , we can easily calculate the @xmath0 s for this problem .",
    "they are given next : @xmath50 therefore , we have a relative fluctuation given by : @xmath51 in figure 4 , we present the results for several values of @xmath19 .",
    "+    in table 1 , we show the srf for the values of @xmath19 considered in the simulations .",
    "we see that while the number of oscillators increases , the srf approaches @xmath5 , its @xmath52 value .",
    "+    .relative fluctuation of @xmath53 for several values of @xmath19 [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a third test of relation ( [ e1-relfluct ] ) would be to study only a term in the potential energy , say @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath55 values may be , in some cases , not so hard to calculate , and ( [ e1-relfluct ] ) would be readly applicable .",
    "unfortunately , this procedure does not work , as we observed by studying the above term .",
    "although its mean value and srf converge , these values are not predicted by our calculations .",
    "we observed that this term does not obeys the equipartition , in other words , its mean value does not follow : @xmath56 this suggests that isolated terms in the potential are non - ergodic , although the whole potential energy is an ergodic one .",
    "+ in figure 5 , we show the time evolution of the quantity : @xmath57 which , by the former , should approach @xmath58 .",
    "clearly , we see that it does not .",
    "we have also observed this behaviour in other terms , such as @xmath59 .",
    "+ although the equipartition does not hold in this case , we could use the final value of @xmath55 and calculate the relative fluctuation of this term . once again",
    ", the value obtained does not coincide with the one observed in the simulations , not shown here .",
    "hence , we can not predict , with the tools of the canonical ensemble , for this @xmath54 term , any quantity , and , by the nature of the problem , we can also say that the other terms in the potential energy follow this line .",
    "+ the reason for this discrepancy may lie in the fact that no term in the potential energy is independent of any other term in the potential energy .",
    "in the kinetic part , no single momentum component is free , it interacts with the potential part , but it does not interact with the other momenta components .",
    "this is why the single terms in the potential energy do not span the allowed phase space .",
    "we saw that our separation of degrees of freedom scheme provides a simple way of studying systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the results obtained here are in very good agreement with the theoretical results .",
    "this fact indicates that the time averages of such finite systems coincide with their ensemble averages .",
    "this seems to be in contradiction with the thought that for statistical mechanics to apply , it is required infinite number of particles , or infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we state that this represents no contradiction at all for ensemble averages are taken with respect to the system s states of energy , and not with respect to the system s degrees of freedom .",
    "the number of states of energy of a system are always infinite in number for a classical system ( which is the case here ) .",
    "+ for example , consider a classical particle in a box .",
    "how many states of energy , i.e. how many values of the canonical coordinates @xmath60 , exist such that are compatible with the particle s energy ? clearly infinite .",
    "generally , every degree of freedom defines a surface in its own phase space , with an infinite number of points ( states ) .",
    "we have simulated two simple systems not in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath , in order to separate its degrees of freedom , and consider them as separate systems , one as the observable and the other as the heat bath .",
    "we intended to study systems with finite number of degrees of freedom , and therefore , to test the results found in @xcite for the square relative fluctuation of the observable system energy .",
    "+ our results are in very good agreement with the theoretical predicted value , hence indicating that these systems are indeed ergodic . + we can conclude that these finite systems do not represent a case of `` bad '' statistics , in the sense that the methods of statistical mechanics do not apply to them .",
    "certainly , the method of boltzmann - gibbs , which assumes an ideal thermostat in certainly not appplicable , but our procedure of considering the system decoupled from the ideal heat bath , hence not in equilibrium with such a system , is clearly a good framework to use .",
