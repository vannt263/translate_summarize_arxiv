    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite has proved very successful in order to describe the physics of mesons at very low energies . the key point of the whole approach is to identify the lightest pseudoscalar mesons @xmath2 and @xmath3 as the goldstone bosons associated to the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "these particles will be the only degrees of freedom at low energies and their interactions can be described in terms of the most general effective lagrangian which respects the chiral symmetry constraints .",
    "so far as this is a low energy approach , the amplitude of a given process is basically given as an expansion in the external momenta over the scale of symmetry breaking @xmath4gev .",
    "it is also possible to calculate loops , which increase by two the order of the term in the chiral expansion and generate logarithmic contributions as well as divergences .",
    "the former are very important at low energies since they can dominate over some polynomial terms and the latter have to be absorbed in the renormalization of the free parameters that appear at the next order in the lagrangian .",
    "it is therefore possible to obtain results which are finite to a given order in momenta .",
    "they provide a very good description of meson interactions up to about 500 mev in the best cases .    however , if one is interested in resonances in particular , as it happens in meson spectroscopy , it is little what one could do with just plain chpt . in this work",
    "we will review recently proposed new nonperturbative schemes imposing unitarity to the chiral lagrangian , thus enlarging the convergence of the chiral expansion and reproducing resonances .",
    "we will briefly comment on possible implications for meson spectroscopy .",
    "within the coupled channel formalism , the unitarity of the @xmath5 matrix reads @xmath6^{-1 } , \\label{iam}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is a _ known _ diagonal matrix , whose entries are just the phase space of the intermediate states .",
    "indeed , @xmath8 is the integral of the propagators of the two particles in the intermediate state . within chpt",
    "the amplitudes are obtained as an expansion in powers of momenta , i.e. @xmath9 , where the subscript stands for the order in the expansion .",
    "being basically a polynomial these amplitudes can only satisfy _ perturbative unitarity _ and they can not yield poles and therefore resonances .    within the inverse amplitude method @xcite , the chpt expansion is only used for @xmath10 , which is then used on the right hand side of eq.([iam ] ) .",
    "this procedure ensures _ exact _",
    "unitarity , while keeping the very same chpt expansion at low energies . using the complete @xmath1 calculation ,",
    "it was first applied to single channel @xmath11 and @xmath12 scattering and it was able to reproduce several isospin and angular momentum channels and to generate dynamically the @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 resonances @xcite . in principle , the iam calculations up to order @xmath16 need the complete chpt calculations up to the same order .",
    "the next step was motivated by the results obtained when unitarizing the lowest order @xmath0 chpt scalar amplitudes using the bethe - salpeter equations ( bs ) @xcite .",
    "remarkably it was possible to fit the meson - meson scalar phase shifts up to 1.2 gev and reproduce the @xmath13 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 resonances , just by setting the cutoff to a natural value around 1 gev , since there are no other free parameters .",
    "the link with the iam was established in @xcite : the bs solution is recovered from the iam if one approximates @xmath19 .",
    "but in order to obtain vector resonances the @xmath0 is not enough .",
    "unfortunately , the full @xmath1 calculation is not available for all the meson - meson scattering channels .",
    "however it was also shown in @xcite that in order to obtain a good results up to 1.2 gev , it is enough to add to the bs approximation the @xmath1 tree level , that is , @xmath20    the results are remarkable , as it can be seen in fig.1 , where we display an updated fit to the meson - meson phase shifts and inelasticities @xcite .",
    "compared with our previous work @xcite , we have also corrected a small error in one amplitude , which only has a minor effect .",
    "it can be noticed that we are able to reproduce together the @xmath13 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath14 , @xmath21 and @xmath15 resonances and the isospin zero state of the vector octet , @xmath22 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is also possible to find , in the unphysical sheets , the poles associated to these resonances ( see @xcite ) .    in table",
    "i we list the values of the fitted iam parameters .",
    "note that within this approximation , tadpoles and crossed loops are neglected and absorbed in the chiral parameters , so that we can not compare directly with the standard chpt coefficients .",
    "nevertheless they should be of the same order of magnitude , once the appropriate renormalization scale is used .",
    ".values of the chiral constants from the iam fit and chpt at their equivalent scales . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     if we had the complete @xmath1 chpt calculation for all the meson - meson channels and we used the same renormalization scheme as in standard chpt , the fitted parameters should be very similar to the standard ones .",
    "this has been checked with the single channel @xmath11 and @xmath12 scattering , but also by calculating the complete @xmath23 @xmath5 amplitude for the @xmath11 , @xmath24 coupled channels @xcite . in both cases the fitted parameters are perfectly compatible with those of standard chpt .",
    "further work is still in progress .",
    "chiral perturbation theory unitarized with the inverse amplitude method , describes correctly the dynamics of meson - meson scattering in coupled channels , generating :    * the @xmath14 and the @xmath15 , as well as a pole that corresponds to the @xmath22 , which , all together , form the lightest _ vector octet_. in order to obtain them it is necessary to include the @xmath1 chiral parameters .",
    "the nonet is not reproduced since in the su(3 ) limit the @xmath25 does not couple to two mesons . * the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath13 and @xmath21 .",
    "all their masses are below 1 gev , and _ the last two are very wide _ , not breit - wigner resonances . _",
    "all of them can be simply generated by unitarization of the lowest order chpt _",
    ", with just a cutoff as a free parameter .",
    "the role of the @xmath1 chiral parameters can be understood @xcite by writing a lagrangian with pions , kaons and etas , but also with heavier resonances coupled in a chirally invariant way .",
    "then one integrates out these heavier states and the resulting lagrangian is that of chpt , but now the values of the chiral constants can be related to the masses and widths of the preexisting heavier resonances ( `` resonance saturation hypothesis '' ) .",
    "most of the experimental values of the chiral coefficients are saturated by these estimates due to vector resonances alone ( that is vector meson dominance ) but some other parameters still need the existence of scalar states .",
    "recently @xcite , using the n / d unitarization method with explicit resonances added to the lowest order chpt lagrangian , it has been established that these heavier scalar states should appear with a mass around 1.3 - 1.4 gev for the octet and 1 gev for the singlet .",
    "in addition , the @xmath13 , @xmath21 , @xmath18 and a strong contribution to the @xmath17 , were also generated from the unitarization of the chpt lowest order .",
    "these states still survive when the heavier scalars are removed",
    ". that agrees with our observation that the @xmath13 , @xmath21 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are generated _ independently of the chiral parameters _ ,",
    "that is , of the preexisting scalar nonet , which is heavier .",
    "since chiral perturbation theory does not deal with quarks and gluons , it is very hard to make any conclusive statement about the nature of these states ( @xmath26 , four - quark , molecule , etc ... ) , unless we make additional assumptions .",
    "however , it seems clear that the nature of the lightest scalar mesons is different from that of vectors .",
    "in addition , the fact that we obtain simultaneously the above nine scalar resonances with the same procedure , seems to indicate that they are good candidates to form a complete @xmath27 nonet .",
