    "it therefore follows that , for any directed graph , we obtain a generalization of the tamari lattice . at the end of this chapter",
    ", we will comment briefly on the lattices that arise in this way , which include the cambrian lattices discussed in reading s contribution to this volume @xcite .",

    "a representation @xmath83 of @xmath2 is called a _ tilting object _",
    "if the only extension of @xmath83 with itself is the trivial extension , and @xmath83 has @xmath1 pairwise non - isomorphic summands ( @xmath1 being the number of vertices of @xmath2 ) . for @xmath215 , write @xmath216 for the subcategory of @xmath14 consisting of all quotients of direct sums of copies of @xmath19 .",

    "this poset structure is related to the one discussed in this paper , because if @xmath83 is a tilting object , then @xmath219 is a torsion class .",
    "further , the torsion classes arising in this way can be described : they are just the torsion classes which include all the injective representations of @xmath2 , see ( * ? ? ?",

    "thus , the torsion classes arising in this way form an interval in the poset of all torsion classes , whose minimal element is the torsion class consisting only of injective representations , and whose maximal element is the torsion class consisting of all representations .    in the case of @xmath148 , @xmath154 is sincere iff @xmath220 , since the injective indecomposable representations are those of the form @xmath221 for @xmath222 .",
