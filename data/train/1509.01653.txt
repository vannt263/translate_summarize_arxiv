    "millimeter wave ( mmwave ) communications is a key candidate technology for future 5 g cellular networks .",
    "this is mainly due to the availability of large spectrum resources at higher frequencies , which leads to much higher data rates .",
    "recent research suggests that mmwave systems will typically feature ( i ) large - dimensional antenna arrays with directional beamforming at the transmitter / receiver  which is motivated by the small wavelength that allows packing a large number of antenna elements into small form - factors ; and ( ii ) a dense deployment of base stations ( bss ) to ensure comparable coverage to ultra high frequency ( uhf ) networks@xcite .",
    "these mmwave design features are also attractive for rf ( radio frequency ) energy harvesting where a harvesting device may extract energy from the incident rf signals@xcite .",
    "this could potentially power the massive number of low - power wireless devices in future paradigms such as the internet of things@xcite .",
    "the signal propagation at mmwave frequencies , however , suffers from poor penetration and diffraction characteristics , making it sensitive to blockage by buildings@xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , unclear if mmwave cellular networks will be more favorable for rf energy harvesting compared to the conventional ( below 6 ghz ) frequencies .",
    "further , the network level design principles for mmwave energy harvesting systems are not well understood .",
    "this motivates a network view of energy harvesting in a mmwave cellular network .      in this paper",
    ", we provide a tractable framework to characterize the performance of wireless energy and information transfer aided by a large - scale mmwave cellular network .",
    "our analysis accounts for the key distinguishing features of mmwave systems , namely the sensitivity to blockage and the use of potentially large antenna arrays at the transmitter / receiver .",
    "we first consider mmwave energy harvesting , where devices only extract energy from the incident mmwave signals .",
    "our analysis models two operating scenarios , one where devices have their beams aligned to that of a mmwave bs , and the other where no such beam alignment is assumed . for both operating modes ,",
    "we derive simple analytical expressions for metrics such as the energy coverage probability and the average harvested power using tools from stochastic geometry .",
    "we then extend the analysis to characterize the overall ( energy - and - information ) coverage probability for the general case where a device extracts both energy and information from the mmwave signals . to get design insights",
    ", we examine the network level performance trends in terms of key parameters such as the mmwave network density and the antenna geometry parameters for both operating modes of the energy harvesting devices .",
    "numerical results suggest that narrower antenna beams are preferred when the users are aligned with a bs , whereas wider beams are favorable when no beam alignment is assumed .",
    "our findings also suggest that there typically exists an optimum transmit antenna beamwidth that maximizes the network - wide energy coverage for a given user population .",
    "this implies that the mmwave bss will need to adapt the antenna beam patterns depending on the fraction of the users operating in each mode .",
    "similar to the bs - related parameters , we also investigate the role of device - related parameters on system performance .",
    "for example , the overall ( energy - and - information ) coverage probability can be improved by optimizing over a design parameter ( power splitting ratio ) to optimally portion the received signal between the energy harvesting and the information decoding modules . another important design feature at the user is the receive antenna array .",
    "similar to the bss , the mmwave users can , in principle , benefit from using large antenna arrays . for low - power energy harvesting devices , however , the associated antenna circuity could increase the power consumption , offsetting the potential gains of large antenna arrays . to leverage multiple antennas at the receiver without resorting to power - hungry circuit components",
    ", we propose a simple switch - based receiver architecture for simultaneous energy and information transfer .",
    "simulation results reveal that the proposed low - power solution performs reasonably well compared to more advanced but power - hungry receiver architectures .",
    "wireless energy harvesting is becoming increasingly feasible due to the reduction in the power consumption requirements of wireless sensors and the improvements in energy harvesting technologies @xcite .",
    "this has also led to considerable research in advancing the theoretical understanding of wireless powered systems ( see @xcite for a comprehensive overview ) .",
    "for example , wireless energy and information transfer has been studied for different information - theoretic setups such as a broadcast channel@xcite , a fading channel@xcite , and an interference channel @xcite .",
    "many of these papers highlight the fundamental trade - off between energy and information transfer efficiency and characterize the achievable rate - energy regions for different practical receiver architectures@xcite .    wireless energy and/or information transfer in large - scale networks",
    "has also been investigated@xcite . in @xcite , the performance of ambient rf energy harvesting",
    "was characterized using tools from stochastic geometry . using a repulsive point process to model rf transmitters",
    ", it was shown that more repulsion helps improve the performance at an energy harvester for a given transmitter density . in @xcite ,",
    "cognitive radio networks were considered , and opportunistic wireless energy harvesting was proposed and analyzed . in @xcite , a hybrid cellular network architecture was proposed to enable wireless power transfer for mobiles . in particular ,",
    "an uplink cellular network was overlaid with power beacons and trade - offs between transmit power and deployment densities were investigated under an outage constraint on the data links .",
    "a broadband wireless network with transmit beamforming was considered in @xcite , where optimal power control algorithms were devised for improving the throughput and power transfer efficiency .",
    "simultaneous information and energy transfer in a relay - aided network was considered in @xcite . under a random relay selection strategy ,",
    "the network - level performance was characterized in terms of the relay density and the relay selection area .",
    "our work differs from the prior work in that we investigate wireless energy and information transfer in a large - scale _ mmwave _ cellular network . due to different physical characteristics and design features at mmwave",
    ", prior work on energy / information transfer in lower frequency networks does not directly apply to mmwave networks . in another line of work , the performance of mmwave cellular networks in terms of signal - to - interference - and - noise ratio ( sinr ) coverage and rate has also been analyzed using stochastic geometry@xcite .",
    "none of this work on mmwave networks , however , provides a performance characterization from the perspective of wireless energy and information transfer .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ secsys ] , we introduce the system model . section [ seceh ] presents the analytical results for mmwave energy harvesting .",
    "the case with simultaneous information and energy transfer is treated in section [ secswipt ] .",
    "we conclude the paper in section [ secconc ] .",
    "in this section , we introduce the network and channel models , followed by a description of the antenna model .",
    "the parameters defined in this section are summarized in table [ table1 ] .",
    "we consider a large - scale cellular network consisting of mmwave bss and a population of wireless - powered devices ( or users ) that operate by extracting energy and/or information in the mmwave band .",
    "the mmwave bss are located according to a homogeneous poisson point process ( ppp ) @xmath0 of density @xmath1 .",
    "the user population is drawn from another homogeneous ppp @xmath2 of density @xmath3 , independently of @xmath4 .",
    "in general , mmwave bss and users may be located outdoors or indoors .",
    "empirical evidence suggests that mmwave signals exhibit high penetration losses for many common building materials@xcite . assuming the building blockages to be impenetrable",
    ", we focus on the case where the bss and users are located outdoors .",
    "we say that a link is line - of - sight ( los ) or non - line - of - sight ( nlos ) depending on whether or not it is intersected by a building blockage .",
    "channel measurement campaigns have reported markedly different propagation characteristics for los / nlos links@xcite . to model blockage due to buildings , we leverage the results in @xcite where the buildings are drawn from a boolean stochastic point process .",
    "we define a line - of - sight ( los ) probability function @xmath5 for a link of length @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a constant that depends on the geometry and density of the building blockage process : a bs - receiver link of length @xmath6 is declared los with a probability @xmath8 , independently of other links . while conducting stochastic geometry analysis , we will apply this result to split the bs ppp into two independent but non - homogeneous ppps consisting of los and nlos bss .",
    "we allow the user population to consist of two types of users , namely _ connected _ and _ nonconnected_. a connected user is assumed to be tagged with the bs , either los or nlos , that maximizes the average received power at that user .",
    "moreover , for the connected case , we assume perfect beam alignment between a bs and its tagged user , i.e. , the bs and user point their beams so as to have the maximum directivity gain .",
    "further , we assume that a bs serves only one connected user at a given time . for a nonconnected user , we do not assume any prior beam alignment with a bs , i.e. , it is not tagged with any bs .",
    "this allows us to model a wide range of scenarios .",
    "for instance , due to limited resources , the mmwave network may ( directly ) serve only a fraction of the user population as connected users , leaving the rest in the nonconnected mode .",
    "another interpretation could be that due to the challenges associated with channel acquisition , not all the users could be simultaneously served in the connected mode .",
    "we let @xmath9 be the probability that a randomly selected node is a connected user , independently of other nodes . with this assumption",
    ", we can thin the user ppp @xmath10 into two independent ppps @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with respective densities @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "note that an arbitrary user , either connected or nonconnected , may experience an energy outage if the received power falls short of a required threshold @xmath15 .",
    "this threshold would depend on the power consumption requirements of the receiver . to capture the sensitivity requirements of the harvesting circuit ,",
    "we define @xmath16 to be the harvester activation threshold , i.e. , the minimum received energy needed to activate the harvesting circuit ( the energy outage threshold @xmath15 would typically be greater than @xmath16 ) .",

    "we define @xmath18 to be the energy coverage probability given an outage threshold @xmath19 for a connected user , while @xmath20 denotes the same for the nonconnected case . with these definitions , we can define the overall energy coverage probability @xmath21 of the network as @xmath22 where the energy coverage probability is a function of several parameters such as the bs density , the channel propagation parameters , as well as the antenna beam patterns at the transmitter / receiver . for cleaner exposition",
    ", we drop the subscript in @xmath19 or @xmath23 , using the notation @xmath24 when the context is clear . in section [ secstoch ] ,",
    "we provide analytical expressions to compute the energy coverage probability in a mmwave network .",
    "we now describe the channel model for an arbitrary user without losing generality .",
    "empirical evidence suggests that mmwave frequencies exhibit different propagation characteristics for the los / nlos links@xcite . while the los mmwave signals propagate as if in free space , the nlos mmwave signals typically exhibit a higher path loss exponent ( and additional shadowing)@xcite .",
    "we let @xmath25 and @xmath26 be the path loss exponents for the los and nlos links respectively .",
