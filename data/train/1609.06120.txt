    "however , no comprehensive , high quality line list has been published for this molecule , limiting the potential information that can be obtained . the exomol project @xcite aims to produce high temperature line lists of spectroscopic transitions for key molecular species likely to be significant in the analysis of the atmospheres of extrasolar planets and cool stars .",
    "the molecular data is crucial for accurate astrophysics models of the opacity , as discussed by @xcite and @xcite , and the spectroscopy of the object .",
    "however , from a chemistry perspective , vanadium is a transition metal in terms of its electronic structure and spectroscopic properties .",
    "this makes the electronic structure calculations much more difficult and gives higher uncertainties @xcite .",
    "vo absorption bands are generally present in cool late m class stars with effective temperature on order 2500 - 3000 k , mass less than 0.1 @xmath2  and are also expected to be observed in hot jupiter exoplanets @xcite .",
    "vo is generally present simultaneously with tio and has similar spectroscopic and thermodynamic properties , though its abundance is about an order of magnitude less than tio .",

    "note that even though the kurucz line list has very low frequency transitions , all transitions are electronic ; the infrared rovibrational transitions within the x state are not included .",
    "it is clear that the new vomyt linelist is significantly more complete , with more than 60 times more lines covering both shorter and longer wavelengths than either of the previous line lists .",
    "there are more electronic states considered , and more vibrational energy levels .",
    "the maximum rotational quantum number @xmath14 is slightly lower due to the fact we used a lower energy cut - off to exclude all spectral lines originating from initial energies greater than 20,000 @xmath1 .",
    "use of our partition function suggests that the kurucz and plez line lists are 90% complete at 2800 k , but fall to approximately 50% complete by 5000 k. this incompleteness means that for high temperatures significant sources of opacity will be missing .",

    "the kurucz linelist is significantly stronger than either the plez or exomol vomyt line lists .",
    "the three line lists have similar strengths around the b - x bands , though the exomol line list is generally strongest especially at regions far from the bandhead ; this is expected as it is most complete",
    ". the exomol vomyt line list has stronger transitions in the c - x bands than either the kurucz or plez line lists .",
    "looking to the longer wavelength regions , the plez line list does not represent the region longer than 2 @xmath0 m well .",
    "the kurucz linelist is better with some features , but the exomol vomyt linelist is significantly more complete .",
    "this is because the exomol linelist for the first time includes transitions from other electronic states , and from excited electronic states .",
