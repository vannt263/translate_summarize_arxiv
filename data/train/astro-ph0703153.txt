    "we then computed the aperture magnitude for all ground based and acs images using an aperture of 15 diameter .",
    "an aperture correction from 15 to 4  diameter has been first computed using point sources , and then applied to all sources in the optical ( acs and fors2 ) and near - ir ( isaac ) bands . although this aperture correction is not strictly equivalent to the smoothing technique , we have checked , using the acs data , that the two approaches give consistent results .",
    "the main advantage of using this approach instead of the smoothing one in this analysis is that we avoid significant source blending , especially in the central region of the cluster .",

    "indeed , rdcs j1252.9 - 2927  has not yet attained an equilibrium state as suggested by a more detailed analysis of the velocity distribution of cluster members .",
    "rdcs j1252.9 - 2927  is the most distant cluster for which a substructure analysis can be attempted .",
    "the kurtosis @xcite indicates that the velocity distribution of cluster members is not gaussian at the @xmath213% c.l .. the weighted gap procedure finds a significant gap in the space of ordered velocities and a 3d kmm study detects substructure in velocity at the @xmath214% c.l .. the substructure is composed by two groups of galaxies which are mostly distributed in a east - west direction on the sky , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figkmm ] .",
    "twenty - six galaxies are confirmed in the `` low - velocity '' group ( centered at @xmath141 km s@xmath3 with respect to the cluster mean velocity ) with a velocity dispersion of @xmath5 km s@xmath3 and located mostly to the west of the cluster center .",
    "twelve galaxies are confirmed in the `` high - velocity '' group ( centered at @xmath142 km @xmath215 with respect to the cluster mean velocity ) with a velocity dispersion of @xmath6 km s@xmath3 and to the east of the cluster center",
    ".    the existence of the above correlations between positions and velocities of cluster galaxies is a footprint of real substructure .",
    "in particular , it suggests that rdcs j1252.9 - 2927  is forming via a merger along the e - w direction .",
    "going further , we estimate the mass contained within @xmath216 for each group ( see section  [ vel_struct ] ) .",
    "the sum of these two masses is about half of the cluster mass , and it should be considered as a lower limit of the latter",
    ". these groups may be the virialized cores of two larger systems , with possibly @xmath217 and larger velocity dispersions .",
    "the fact that the x - ray emission presents a single peak , although elongated in morphology , indicates that these two groups have already started virialization .",
    "this is supported by the degree of merging of the group members as shown in fig .",
    "[ figkmm ] .",
    "our substructure analysis has thus found the remnant traces of two sub - clusters merging parallel to the sky as suggested by the lack of a clear bimodal distribution of the overall cluster velocity field .    by using the @xmath218 relation for groups in @xcite , we find that both groups have velocity dispersions consistent with the same temperature of @xmath502 kev .",
    "this temperature is inconsistent with the overall cluster temperature of @xmath506 kev , yet it corresponds to about half the total cluster x - ray luminosity according to the group @xmath219 relation @xcite .",
    "thus , both groups seem to be independently virialized and the sum of their x - ray luminosities would be approximately equal to the total cluster @xmath210 .",
    "the temperature value of the overall icm would have been the consequence of gas particle interactions at an earlier epoch during the merger of the groups . by the epoch of observation ,",
    "the overall icm is consistent with being in an almost isothermal hydrostatic equilibrium in a single potential well , while the groups are fossilized in the velocity dispersion substructure .",
    "the agreement of the observed cluster @xmath210 and @xmath211 values with the @xmath219 relation and the deviation of the cluster values from the @xmath218 relation show that the gas in the cluster is more relaxed than the galaxies . since galaxies behave more like dark matter particles , they still need more time to reach the @xmath218 relation expected for the cluster . in summary , the elongated shape of the cluster structure ( in all its components : baryons and dark matter ) and",
    "the substructure in velocity leads us to conclude that rdcs j1252.9 - 2927  has not yet reached a final virial state : we may be seeing gravitational collapse of two or more sub - clusters along a high density filament .    in this work we present an improved analysis of the near - ir color - magnitude diagram of galaxies in rdcs j1252.9 - 2927 , based on isaac data which have been reprocessed in order to optimise image quality and obtain more accurate photometry over the entire region covered by near - ir observations .",
    "we use only spectroscopic cluster members and the analysis extends over more than @xmath7 mpc from the cluster center , in contrast to previous studies .",
    "the fit to the red cluster sequence , including all passive spectroscopic members , yields slope and scatter values consistent with the result of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the early - type galaxy cluster population has formed most of its stellar content at @xmath220 and has passively evolved since down to the epoch of observation , as previously shown for @xmath11 clusters @xcite .",
    "if we restrict the fit of the cluster red sequence to spectroscopic members brighter than @xmath221 , the slope becomes significantly shallower , suggesting that the cm relation of passively evolving systems seems to be non - linear , although this could also be due to a selection effect .",
    "the [ oii ] emission line observed in 17 cluster galaxies allows us to estimate a lower limit value of @xmath222 yr@xmath3 for the median sfr in the cluster .",
    "only 5 out of 25 spectroscopic members that are brighter than @xmath223 show ongoing star formation .",
    "three star - forming galaxies have colors as red as galaxies in the red cluster sequence of both @xmath190 vs. @xmath42 ( optical ) and @xmath191 vs. @xmath25 ( near - ir ) color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "one additional star - forming galaxy is observed in the red sequence of the near - ir color - magnitude diagram but not in the optical one , suggesting that we are observing a dust - rich galaxy .",
    "finally , a highly obscured agn is observed to be a spectroscopic member of rdcs j1252.9 - 2927 , and we do not find any evidence of `` red mergers '' like those observed in the galaxy cluster ms1054 @xcite .",
    "the projected distribution of passive and star - forming galaxies in this cluster shows a spectrum - density relation that qualitatively resembles the observed morphology - density relation at @xmath11 @xcite : passive , early - type galaxies dominate the cluster core while star - forming , late - type galaxies are found in the outskirts of the cluster . from a dynamical point of view , we are witnessing hierarchical structure formation : we are observing a merger of two large groups of galaxies into a more massive structure .",

    "<S> we present results from an extensive spectroscopic survey , carried out with vlt fors , and from an extensive multiwavelength imaging data set from the hst advanced camera for surveys and ground based facilities , of the cluster of galaxies rdcs j1252.9 - 2927 . </S>",
    "<S> we have spectroscopically confirmed 38 cluster members in the redshift range @xmath0 . a cluster median redshift of @xmath1 and a rest - frame velocity dispersion of @xmath2 km  s@xmath3 are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> using the 38 confirmed redshifts , we were able to resolve , for the first time at @xmath4 , kinematic structure . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity distribution , which is not gaussian at the 95% confidence level , is consistent with two groups that are also responsible for the projected east - west elongation of the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the groups are composed of 26 and 12 galaxies with velocity dispersions of @xmath5 km s@xmath3 and @xmath6 km s@xmath3 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the elongation is also seen in the intracluster gas and the dark matter distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this leads us to conclude that rdcs j1252.9 - 2927  has not yet reached a final virial state . </S>",
    "<S> we extend the analysis of the color - magnitude diagram of spectroscopic members to more than @xmath7 mpc from the cluster center . </S>",
    "<S> the scatter and slope of non-[oii]-emitting cluster members in the near - ir red sequence is similar to that seen in clusters at lower redshift . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , most of the galaxies with luminosities greater than @xmath8 do not show any [ oii ] , indicating that these more luminous , redder galaxies have stopped forming stars earlier than the fainter , bluer galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> our observations provide detailed dynamical and spectrophotometric information on galaxies in this exceptional high - redshift cluster , delivering an in - depth view of structure formation at this epoch only 5 gyr after the big bang . </S>"
