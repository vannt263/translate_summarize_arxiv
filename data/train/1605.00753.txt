    "[ fig3 ] . using the parameter @xmath168 to speed up the cooling process",
    "was discussed by liu _",
    "_ physrevlett.110.153606 , which is in consistency with eq.(14 ) .",
    "( 2 ) the factor @xmath169 indicates clearly that the backflow from the non - markovian environment into the cavity field via the mechanical oscillator does indeed cool the mechanical oscillator with the processes @xmath170 and @xmath171 involved .",
    "certainly , the markovian environment of the cavity field is still needed since it is the final place for the lost energy of the mechanical oscillator .",
    "( 3 ) the frequency component @xmath172 @xmath173 yields the main contribution . if @xmath174 , the second term in eq .  ( 14 ) is fast oscillating and makes no contribution to the cooling .",
    "in order to maintain the optimal cooling effect , the frequency of the environment should be centered about the frequency of the mechanical oscillator .",
    "hence , when the non - markovian memory effect is included , even the temperature of the bath is much higher than that of the phonon mode , and the environment could be also regarded as a freezer in the cooling of the oscillator .",
    "+ in the review process of the paper , we noticed the new publication  cooling in which the ultrafast optimal sideband cooling with a non - markovian evolution is proposed .",
    "they optimally designed the coupling functions so as to optimize the cooling rate in both markovian and non - markovian environments for the cavity field as well as for the mechanical oscillator .",
    "different from the work reported in  @xcite , we aim to achieve lower phonon numbers in the long - time scale . through the analysis of the cooling mechanism in a non - markovian environment",
    ", we showed that the backflow from the non - markovian environment of the mechanical oscillator into the cavity field with the further decay into the non - memory environment of the cavity field is the cause for lower phonon numbers .",
    "this conclusion coincides with @xcite in which the non - markovian dynamics in the cavity field deteriorates their cooling protocol .",
    "in this paper , we put forward an environment engineering scheme for the mechanical cooling . making use of several spectra including the one obtained in the experiment @xcite",
    ", we showed that the cooling effect in the present scheme is better than that in a markovian environment .",
    "we also analyzed the cooling mechanism of a non - markovian environment .",
    "our analysis showed that the mechanical oscillator environment is not always detrimental to the cooling .",
    "if the environment possesses the non - markovian memory effect , not only is the entanglement physreva.91.022328,reich2015 protected but also the mechanical cooling is optimized .",
    "a high temperature bath could be also regarded as a freezer to the cooling of the oscillator .",
    "most importantly , with the present experiment technology , we can use a non - markovian environment to cool a mechanical oscillator so as to go beyond the limit of a markovian environment .",
