    "topological solitons arise in many classical field theories @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest systems to admit solitons is the sine - gordon model .",
    "these solitons are known as kinks and occur in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "the model is described by the lagrangian density @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a scalar field and @xmath2 is a coupling constant . applying the standard variational principle leads to the field equation @xmath3 this so - called sine - gordon equation has applications in a large number of areas of physical and bio - physical interest , including the josephson effect @xcite , nuclear physics @xcite , non - linear optics @xcite , ferromagnetic spin chains @xcite and wave propagation in brain microtubules @xcite , amongst others .",
    "taking a spin chain in the easy plane model of a ferromagnet as an example , @xmath2 is determined by the strength of the magnetic field , which occurs in a direction in the ( @xmath4-@xmath5 ) easy plane ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "when this system becomes inhomogeneous , that is the magnetic field has a @xmath6-dependence , then the corresponding parameter @xmath2 is also space - dependent .",
    "the bloch equation describing the system still leads to a sine - gordon equation , and solitons can still occur .",
    "we will not discuss physical interpretations further . in this paper",
    ", we shall be interested in the sine - gordon model with parameter @xmath2 , which , as a function of space , is of the form of a smooth well or barrier .",
    "for our system , @xmath2 will be positive and , far away from the origin , very close to unity .",
    "the interaction of a sine - gordon soliton with a potential obstacle was first investigated by fei et al @xcite .",
    "the authors investigated a kink incident on a point defect and found a novel behaviour in which , for certain incoming velocities , the kink is reflected backwards , due to its interaction with the defect .",
    "many of the results in @xcite were explained by goodman and haberman @xcite in terms of a two - bounce resonance model . in @xcite piette and",
    "zakrzewski investigated a sine - gordon kink interacting with a potential with a space - dependent term in the form of a rectangular well .",
    "they found that back - reflection for some incoming velocities also arises for this system and gave two effective models to account for this phenomenon .",
    "soliton interactions with rectangular wells have also been discussed for various other soliton systems @xcite . a kink interacting with a smooth well is discussed in @xcite in terms of the sine - gordon model and in for the @xmath7 model .",
    "while these papers address the dynamics of a kink interacting with a well , multi - kinks interacting with wells have so far not been investigated .    in this paper , section [ sgintro ] gives a review of sine - gordon kinks .",
    "then section [ potentials ] introduces a two - parameter family of space - dependent potentials which include a variety of wells and barriers . in section [ onekink ]",
    "the results of simulations of the dynamics of a single kink interacting with a particular well are given .",
    "following this , in section [ twokinks ] , the dynamics of a moving kink incident on a well with another initially at rest in the well are presented .",
    "the paper also gives plots of the scattering data for @xmath8-kink and @xmath9-kink systems with two different types of wells , these are discussed at the end of section [ twokinks ] .",
    "the paper ends with a conclusion .",
    "in this section , we recall some basic facts about sine - gordon kinks and set up our notation .    the energy of static sine - gordon kink is @xmath10 one can also define a super potential , @xmath11 given by @xmath12 the energy ( [ e ] ) can then be rewritten in terms of two integrals @xmath13 for a minimum energy soliton , we obtain the bogomolny equations @xmath14 where the @xmath15 sign gives a kink or anti - kink . substituting the solution of ( [ super ] ) into ( [ bog ] ) gives the kink field @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a constant of integration and corresponds to the position of the kink . the energy can then be evaluated to be @xmath18 so one has the bogomolny bound @xmath19 since the lagrangian density ( [ lagrange ] ) is lorentz invariant , a boost can be applied to ( [ sgkink ] ) to give a moving kink with field configuration @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the velocity of the kink , with @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the lorentz factor , and we have set @xmath24 for simplicity . there is a topological charge @xmath25 associated with a sine - gordon kink @xmath26 at @xmath27 the field @xmath28 needs to minimize the potential energy in ( [ e ] ) , hence we choose @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , equation ( [ n ] ) clearly takes integer values . for charge @xmath25",
    "the bogomolny bound becomes @xmath31 for the case of multi - kinks this bound can not be saturated as there is a repulsive force between two static kinks .",
    "indeed , in @xcite perring and skyrme show that the asymptotic interaction energy of two sine - gordon kinks is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the separation between the kinks .    as well as being lorentz invariant , the sine - gordon model is also fully integrable ( see @xcite for a review of integrable systems ) . therefore , it has the feature that solution generating techniques , such as the bcklund transformation , are applicable ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for @xmath34 this transformation can be used to obtain the field @xmath35 this describes two individual kinks , one static at negative infinity in time and the other travelling with speed @xmath21 at this instant .",
    "the field configurations of the kinks gradually approach each other with time and the solitons interact . for simplicity ,",
    "we have set @xmath24 in formula ( [ 2kinks ] ) .    in the sine - gordon model",
    "there is also a breather solution , which exists in the charge zero sector and can be interpreted as a kink anti - kink bound state .",
    "a solution that is a bound state of a breather and kink , the sine - gordon wobble , is described in @xcite .",
    "these solutions show interesting behaviour when they are interacting with square wells @xcite .     for various values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 detailed scattering experiments",
    "have been performed on the wells displayed with solids lines .",
    "these are the quartic well @xmath38 a narrow well without humps @xmath39 and a generic well with humps @xmath40 some other examples of wells are displayed in dotted lines , for example the double well @xmath41 .",
    "[ wells],width=453 ]",
    "in the following , we describe a class of space - dependent potentials , where the coupling constant @xmath2 in ( [ sgeq ] ) becomes space - dependent .",
    "square - well - type potentials have been discussed for example in @xcite .",
    "these have the disadvantage that they are not smooth . here",
    ", we propose a smooth two - parameter family of barriers and wells , with the additional advantage that there is an analytic solution for a static kink located at the centre of the barrier or well .",
    "figure [ wells ] displays the wells which we study in this paper , and figure [ barriers ] shows a selection of barriers .    the static kink ( [ sgkink ] ) located at @xmath42 solves the static field equations @xmath43 for constant @xmath44 by allowing @xmath2 to depend on @xmath4 we can find a two parameter family of kinks located at @xmath45 which solves the static field equations ( [ kinkeq ] ) .",
    "the kinks are given by @xmath46 provided that we set @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 note that the trivial vacuum solutions @xmath50 also satisfy ( [ kinkeq ] ) for all functions @xmath51 provided @xmath52 is an integer .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath53 and that the map @xmath54 leaves @xmath51 invariant .",
    "physically , this means that @xmath2 is the same for a kink @xmath55 and an anti - kink @xmath56 . in the following ,",
    "we restrict our attention to kinks and set @xmath57 . since the @xmath58 term dominates for large @xmath59 the parameter @xmath36 can take positive and negative values provided @xmath60 setting @xmath61",
    "also guarantees that @xmath62 which means that the kink located at @xmath63 given by ( [ sgkink ] ) tends to the exact solution for large @xmath64 that is when the kink is far enough away from the well . for @xmath65 , the asymptotics change . in this case , @xmath66 which tends to @xmath67 as @xmath68 since we want the usual sine - gordon kink ( [ sgkink ] ) to be an asymptotic solution , we only consider the case @xmath69    in order to determine the values of @xmath36 and @xmath70 for which @xmath51 is regular , we solve equation ( [ kinkeq ] ) for @xmath2 and obtain @xmath71 therefore , singularities can only occur for @xmath72 . with our choice of @xmath61",
    "we have @xmath73 hence , since @xmath74 is a monotonic function and @xmath75 , @xmath51 can only have singularities at @xmath76 , where @xmath77 taking the derivative of ( [ ax+bsinhx ] ) leads to @xmath78 this implies that @xmath79 for @xmath80 so that @xmath81 is a monotonic function whose only root is @xmath45 .",
    "we can evaluate the limit @xmath82 hence , @xmath51 diverges for @xmath61 and @xmath83 for @xmath84 the function @xmath81 has one maximum and one minimum and hence two non - trivial zeros .",
    "generically , @xmath51 will be singular for @xmath85    physical applications usually demand that @xmath86 this condition is satisfied provided @xmath36 satisfies the stronger inequality @xmath87 furthermore , we are mostly interested in wells located at the origin , which implies @xmath88    an interesting one parameter family is obtained by setting @xmath89 it follows from ( [ lim1 ] ) that @xmath90 therefore , we obtain a well with @xmath91 for @xmath92 whereas for @xmath93 this is a barrier .",
    "this one - parameter family is an example of a pure well or barrier , respectively , because the only extrema of @xmath51 is at @xmath94    fixing the value of @xmath95 and @xmath70 gives a cubic equation for @xmath96 which is most conveniently expressed in terms of the variable @xmath97 namely @xmath98 this cubic has the discriminant @xmath99 hence equation ( [ cubic ] ) has three real solutions for @xmath100 two real solutions for @xmath101 and only one real solution for @xmath102 .",
    "however , not all solutions will lead to regular wells .    in order to gain a better understanding of the various wells and barriers it is useful to calculate @xmath103",
    "when this limit vanishes we have a quartic well .    in figure [ wells ] , we considered wells with @xmath104 there is a one - parameter family of wells with humps on both sides for @xmath105 our main example is @xmath106 and @xmath107 there is another one parameter family of wells with @xmath108 which includes pure wells , the quartic well and double wells . as can be seen in figure [ wells ] ,",
    "the pure wells for @xmath108 are wider than the pure well at @xmath89 using equation ( [ lim2 ] ) we can derive the values for the quartic well , namely , @xmath109 and @xmath110 with @xmath111 for @xmath112 we obtain double wells , where there is a local maximum at @xmath113 and global minima at either side .    in figure",
    "[ barriers ] , we show interesting examples of barriers . again , there are pure barriers , barriers with wells at either side and volcano ( or double peak ) barriers .",
    "in this section , we consider a sine - gordon kink travelling towards our standard well with various initial velocities and plot the trajectories .",
    "we also calculate the critical velocities for different barriers and compare these to an analytic approximation .",
    "first , we briefly comment on our numerical scheme .",
    "the equations of motion for the kinks have been solved using a standard fourth order runge - kutta method with gridsize 10001 .",
    "plus and minus `` infinity '' are located at @xmath114 and @xmath115 respectively , so that the stepsize in space is @xmath116 the stepsize in time has usually been taken to be @xmath117 which is the same choice of parameters as in @xcite . for small initial velocities of the kink , larger values of @xmath118 are appropriate .",
    "figure [ 1kink ] illustrates all relevant phenomena for one kink interacting with a well .",
    "we have chosen the well with parameters @xmath106 and @xmath119 , which has a minimum @xmath120 and two humps at @xmath121 of height @xmath122 .    for low velocity @xmath123 , there is elastic back - reflection from the hump , so that initial and final velocity are equal in size , as in figure [ 1kinka ] . for higher velocity",
    "the kink overcomes the initial barrier and becomes trapped in the well which is illustrated in figure [ 1kinkb ] .",
    "the critical velocity @xmath124 is defined as the smallest initial velocity which allows the kink to cross the well ( or barrier ) . for the well discussed here , the critical velocity is @xmath125 an example of a kink crossing the well is given in figure [ 1kinkd ] where it can be seen that the kink gains speed inside the well .",
    "the most interesting behaviour happens for a narrow range of velocities just below @xmath126 as figure [ 1kinkc ] shows , the kink may enter the well , get reflected from the well and then leave the well travelling in the opposite direction .",
    "this type of behaviour has been discussed in detail in @xcite . for our standard",
    "well , this resonance window is very narrow .",
    "in fact the kink is trapped for @xmath127 is back - reflected for @xmath128 and trapped once more for @xmath129 for @xmath130 the kink escapes .      in this section",
    "we follow an argument in @xcite to calculate an analytic approximation to the critical velocity , @xmath124 .",
    "we then compare the analytic calculations with numerical results .    making use of the moduli space approximation @xcite",
    ", we make the ansatz @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the position of the solution as a function of time . substituting ( [ phix(t ) ] ) into ( [ lagrange ] ) we obtain @xmath133 note that @xmath2 is now a function of @xmath134 the lagrangian is then @xmath135 this has a non - trivial potential term , and the motion of a soliton on the moduli space is therefore not geodesic for non - constant @xmath136 this is expected as there will always be a static force on the solution when in the presence of a well or barrier such as the one in the model presented .",
    "the total energy of a soliton can be calculated @xmath137 in the absence of an obstacle , @xmath138 and the energy is @xmath139 for a soliton at rest i.e. @xmath140 the kink mass is @xmath141 in the case of a pure barrier , @xmath142 therefore , for a kink stationary on top of the barrier @xmath143 for a pure well , on the other hand , @xmath144 so a static kink at the bottom of the well will have mass @xmath145 otherwise , one can not say which inequality holds without explicitly evaluating the integral appearing in ( [ int ] ) .",
    "energy conservation dictates that in the case of elastic scattering the mass , @xmath146 of a static kink on top of a barrier , is related to the critical velocity , @xmath147 for the barrier by the following formula ( appearing in @xcite ) @xmath148 figure [ barriers ] shows some barriers of different types and heights .",
    "@xmath149 ) , a volcano barrier ( @xmath150 @xmath151 ) , and three pure barriers ( @xmath152 @xmath153 ) , ( @xmath152 @xmath154 ) and ( @xmath152 @xmath155 ) with height @xmath156 @xmath9 and @xmath157 respectively .",
    "[ barriers],width=453 ]    in table [ criticalv ] we present critical velocities calculated both numerically and using equation ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "it is clear that the theoretical approach is accurate for barriers that are monotonically increasing before the origin and monotonically decreasing afterwards .",
    "otherwise , there is discrepancy .",
    "this is explained by considering the fact that for all models investigated so far solitons have elastic scattering on barriers and inelastic scattering on holes .",
    ".the values of @xmath36 and @xmath70 are the parameters of the barriers discussed in figure [ barriers ] , the column `` mass '' gives the energy of the a kink located on top of the barrier , the two columns with @xmath124 compare the analytic approximation to the critical velocity to its numerical value , @xmath159 is the height of the barrier at @xmath45 and the final column gives the type of barrier.[criticalv ] [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "in general , the interaction of two kinks with a well is rather complicated because the trajectories depend on the initial positions and the initial velocities of both kinks . here",
    ", we restrict our attention to scattering processes when the first kink approaches the well with given initial velocity @xmath160 and the second kink is at rest in the well . our potential @xmath51 has been chosen , such that the first kink is given asymptotically by equation ( [ initialkink ] ) whereas the second kink is given by equation ( [ kinkatrest ] ) . the exact solution ( [ 2kinks ] ) can not be generalized to our wells . however , since kinks are exponentially localized , we can just concatenate the two kinks provided the first kink is far enough away from the well .",
    "figure [ 2kink ] illustrates some important trajectories for our standard well .",
    "when the first kink travels with small initial velocity , e.g. @xmath161 then there is elastic back - reflection , such that the final velocity of the first kink is @xmath162 and the second kink remains at rest in the well , see figure [ 2kinka ] .",
    "the trajectory of the first kink closely resembles the trajectory of a single kink in figure [ 1kinka ] .",
    "figure [ 2kinkb ] shows inelastic scattering where the first kink loses energy , and the second kink clearly gains energy because is it now oscillating in the well . in figure",
    "[ 2kinkc ] the second kink is knocked out of the well by the first kink which also escapes from the well .",
    "figure [ 2kinkd ] shows a similar scenario .",
    "the second kink is again knocked out of the well , whereas the first kink is now trapped in the well .",
    "it is worth comparing this outcome to the exact solution when there is no well . in this case",
    ", the first kink loses all its kinetic energy to the second kink , so that after the scattering event the first kink is at rest whereas the second kink moves with velocity @xmath163    we checked the range @xmath164 in detail , in the hope that there would be a double back - reflection , so that first kink and second kink both escape on the same side .",
    "but for our standard well , we were unable to find this kind of behaviour .    in figure [ 2kinkq ]",
    ", we discuss two interesting trajectories for the quartic well ( @xmath165 @xmath166 ) .",
    "this is a rather wide well which allows both kinks to be trapped .",
    "figure [ 2kinke ] shows an interesting quasi - periodic motion where the two kinks knock each other out of the centre of the well but not gaining enough energy to leave the well .",
    "figure [ 2kinkf ] shows a novel type of back - reflection .",
    "the first kink enters the well and speeds up , then hits the second kink and knocks it off the centre of the well .",
    "the second kink slows down , returns to the centre and gives the first kink enough kinetic energy to escape the well .",
    "figure [ vivf1 ] shows initial versus final velocity for our standard well . in the left figure , one kink travels towards the well with initial velocity @xmath163 for @xmath167 the kink is elastically back - reflected . as @xmath21 is increased , the kink is trapped . for @xmath168",
    "the kink escapes the well .",
    "as @xmath21 tends to one the kink feels the influence of the well less , so that the final velocity tends to the initial velocity for @xmath169 .",
    "the back - reflection at @xmath128 is too narrow to be detected with the resolution used for this figure .",
    "however , there is another backreflection at @xmath170    the right figure in [ vivf1 ] shows initial versus final velocity for our standard well , where a second kink is at rest inside the well .",
    "elastic scattering takes place for a longer range of initial velocity @xmath163 as the initial velocity of the incoming kink increases , the kink in the well is set oscillating more energetically . because of this , at some point the final velocity of the first kink starts to become less negative . at higher initial velocities the final velocity of the initially static kink increases and approaches one , while the final velocity of the other soliton takes the value zero in two separated `` windows '' , but is more negative between and after these windows .",
    "figure [ vivf2 ] shows initial velocity versus final velocity for a narrow well without humps . in the left figure , one kink travels towards the well with initial velocity @xmath163 there is a `` resonant window '' at @xmath171 where back - reflection occurs . in comparison to figure [ vivf1 ] the behaviour near the critical velocity is less abrupt . for large initial speed ,",
    "the initial velocity approaches the final velocity .",
    "however , there is a region where the curve appears to `` wobble '' . in terms of our numerical simulations",
    ", we have checked sensitivity to stepsize in time and space independently .",
    "the wobble is more sensitive to the stepsize in space , but appears to be a genuine phenomenon .",
    "this could be a novel feature due to our potential .",
    "the figure on the right in [ vivf2 ] shows initial velocity versus final velocity for the narrow well without humps , where a second kink is initially static in the well . at small to medium initial velocities ,",
    "elastic and in - elastic back - reflection occurs . for velocity @xmath172",
    "the static kink is ejected from the well and at marginally greater initial velocity , the first kink becomes trapped . for higher velocities",
    "both kinks escape the well in opposite directions . again",
    "the final velocity of the first kink is not a monotonic function of the initial velocity .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the interactions of kinks with wells and barriers .",
    "we introduced a novel class of smooth potentials which included pure wells and pure barriers of various heights and widths .",
    "these potentials also give rise to wells with two side barriers and barriers with two side wells , as well as double wells and volcano barriers .",
    "the main advantage of the proposed potentials is that the static kink - in - the - well solution is explicitly known .",
    "the asymptotic kink solution for a kink located at very large @xmath63 is also known .",
    "therefore , a kink can be scattered off a kink - in - the - well and the only relevant parameter is initial velocity of the incoming kink .",
    "when the exact solution of the kink in the well is not known , then the trapped kink tends to oscillate in the well , such that the scattering behaviour depends not only on the velocity of the incoming kink but also on the phase of the trapped kink , which is more difficult to control .",
    "we studied the scattering of one kink off a well , mainly focussing on our standard well with @xmath120 and two side humps , and reproduced all the known phenomena such as trapping , back - reflection and escape .",
    "we then compared numerically calculated critical velocities for various barriers to an analytic approximation assuming elastic scattering .",
    "as expected there was good agreement for pure barriers , and less agreement for the volcano barrier and the barrier with side wells .",
    "it would also be interesting to consider the two - kink system , with one kink initially static in a well and to compute the `` critical velocity '' of an incoming kink at which this static kink is knocked out of the well .",
    "the novel feature of this paper is the scattering of multi - kinks in the presence of a well .",
    "we calculated various trajectories for our standard well , such as elastic scattering , inelastic scattering , kink one replacing kink two in the well and a scattering where both kinks escape .",
    "unfortunately , we were unable to find a double back - reflection for our standard well , but it is likely that such a trajectory exists for the right choice of well parameters and initial velocity . for the quartic well , we found double trapping of kinks and a novel type of back - reflection .",
    "we also plotted initial velocity against final velocity , both for an empty well and a kink trapped in a well . in the case of our standard",
    "well with humps , we found that , for a single kink , the plot reproduced all the expected behaviour .",
    "in the case of an incoming kink and a kink initially in the well we found for small to medium initial velocities there is back - reflection that starts of as elastic then becomes inelastic .",
    "when the initial velocity becomes high , the static kink is ejected and there are two `` windows '' in which the initially moving kink is trapped . for a narrow well without humps",
    "the plot for a single kink revealed a `` resonant window '' and an interesting `` wobbling '' behaviour .",
    "the plots for two kinks showed that as the initial velocity increases , there is a point where the static kink is ejected and further on , the first kink becomes trapped . at high speeds both kinks escape the well , moving in opposite directions .",
    "again , the final velocity of the first kink is not a monotonic function of the initial velocity .",
    "a long term aim of this line of work is to be able to design wells which have desirable properties . in certain physical systems , it is possible to make the coupling constant inhomogeneous , e.g. the ferromagnetic spin chain described in the introduction @xcite .",
    "barriers and wells might then be used to control kink dynamics for example by acting as filters .",
    "an even more ambitious aim is discussed in @xcite where a particular kind of integrable point defect could be used to construct simple logical gates .",
    "our approach is applicable to various different systems .",
    "the @xmath173 kink allows similar wells and barriers which would enable the study of kink anti - kink scattering in the presence of barriers and wells .",
    "well interaction has also been discussed for various other solitons for example deformed sine - gordon models @xcite , @xmath7 models @xcite , q - ball systems @xcite or generalized sigma models @xcite where our approach may again prove to be useful .",
    "reference @xcite presents calculations for two interacting kinks using the method of manton for constant @xmath2 .",
    "in @xcite a moduli space approximation was proposed which also takes account of the degrees of freedom of the well .",
    "see @xcite for related work on the @xmath7 kink .",
    "our calculations imply that the an additional degree of freedom could be the slope of the soliton at the centre of the kink as parametrized by @xmath36 and @xmath70 .",
    "one could therefore investigate moduli space dynamics applied to the model described in this paper , where @xmath96 @xmath70 and @xmath17 for each kink become functions of @xmath174 and the degree of freedom of the well is also taken into account .",

    "<S> sine - gordon kinks are a much studied integrable system that possesses multi - soliton solutions . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies on sine - gordon kinks with space - dependent square - well - type potentials have revealed interesting dynamics of a single kink interacting with wells and barriers . in this paper , we study a class of smooth space - dependent potentials and discuss the dynamics of one kink in the presence of different wells . </S>",
    "<S> we also present values for the critical velocity for different types of barriers . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we study two kinks interacting with various wells and describe interesting trajectories such as double - trapping , kink knock - out and double - escape . </S>"
