    "core - collapse supernovae contribute to the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium ( and thus to the next generation of stars ) in two ways : they eject elements that were synthesized during the life of stars ( e.g. , helium , nitrogen , oxygen and carbon ) and they produce new and heavier elements during the explosion . although the link between core - collapse supernovae and the origin of heavy elements was done more than fifty years ago @xcite , there have been many new and exciting developments in the field of supernovae nucleosynthesis . here",
    "we want to summarize the nucleosynthesis in the neutrino - powered ejecta known as neutrino - driven wind of the newly born proto - neutron star .",
    "the lightest elements were produced in the big bang , followed by the formation of the first stars and by the production of heavier elements in subsequent nuclear burning phases in their interiors .",
    "the death of the first stars enriches the interstellar medium , and the next generations of stars reprocess the previously expelled material .",
    "this process continues in recurrent star formation , stellar evolution , and stellar death stages ( galactic chemical evolution ) .",
    "although this synthesis is believed to be generally understood , key questions in the physics remain .",
    "for example , how do massive stars die in core - collapse supernova explosions ? how are half of the elements heavier than iron produced ?",
    "core - collapse supernovae mark the end of the life of stars with at least eight times the mass of our sun , leading to the birth of neutron stars and stellar - mass black holes .",
    "after millions of years of hydrostatic burning , no further energy can be gained from fusion and the iron core collapses when it reaches the maximum mass stabilized by the pressure of a degenerate electron gas .",
    "the collapse suddenly stops , when the core is compressed to nuclear densities by gravity , and the inner core bounces back , forming a shock wave .",
    "this supernova shock loses energy by photo - dissociation of iron - group nuclei in the material encountered by the passing shock wave .",
    "this leads to a stalled shock , and it remains an open question how it re - accelerates and produces a successful explosion ( see refs .",
    "the best studied and still most promising mechanism to re - accelerate the shock is due neutrinos because they can transport the energy from the hot proto - neutron star to the shock .",
    "after the successful launch of the supernova explosion , the proto - neutron star in the center cools by emitting neutrinos .",
    "the energy deposited by these neutrinos via capture and scattering events powers a baryonic outflow that expands with supersonic velocities and is known as the neutrino - driven wind .",
    "this neutrino - driven wind is a promising site for different nucleosynthesis processes and was proposed as the main host for the r - process .",
    "the general conditions required for the r - process can be studied using analytic  @xcite and steady - state  @xcite models of neutrino - driven winds .",
    "these have established high entropy , fast expansion , and low electron fraction ( @xmath0 ) as necessary to obtain a high ratio of neutrons to so - called seed nuclei in the iron group or beyond ( neutron - to - seed ratio ) which act as seeds for rapid neutron capture to form the heaviest elements .",
    "parametric models show that a strong r - process can occur  @xcite , but only for conditions that are not reached in current long - time hydrodynamic simulations  @xcite .    at present",
    "it is unclear if the conditions in neutrino - driven winds are extreme enough for a successful r - process up to uranium , but it is certain that core - collapse supernovae are fascinating hosts where various nucleosynthesis processes produce neutron - rich and neutron - deficient nuclei . as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , neutrino - driven winds can also be the site where lighter heavy elements ( e.g. , sr , y , zr ) are produced by the weak r - process or by the @xmath1p - process .",
    "these can account for the suggested lighter element primary process ( lepp ) contribution  @xcite , responsible for the abundances of these elements at low metallicities in very old stars where the s - process is not active yet .",
    "the fingerprints of supernova nucleosynthesis are observed in our solar system .",
    "the solar photosphere and meteorites reflect the chemical signature of the gas cloud where the sun formed .",
    "these abundances show the combined results of different nucleosynthesis contributions and the imprints of nuclear physics .",
    "the fast decrease of the abundances towards the iron peak is due to the increasing coulomb barrier for charged particle fusion reactions ( with increasing proton number ) that hinders the production of heavier elements .",
    "then neutron capture takes over as main mechanism for forming heavier than iron - group nuclei , and one distinguishes between the s - process and r - process  @xcite , which yield double peaks in the abundances corresponding to neutron magic numbers , @xmath2  50 , 82 , and 126 .",
    "the oldest stars observed , known as ultra metal - poor ( ump ) stars , show lines of heavy elements in their spectra indicating that these elements were already expelled in very early r - process events  @xcite .",
    "these ump stars are very rare , however their detection is increasing successful with large - scale surveys and new telescopes  @xcite that are providing new insights in the origin of elements . when abundances of ump stars are compared to the scaled solar system abundances , there are two clear underlying trends : 1 ) for elements between barium and lead ( @xmath3 ) the relative abundances are the same in ump stars and in the r - process component of the solar system .",
    "this indicates that these elements are always produced in the same way by a",
    "_ robust r - process_. this robustness can be due to the astrophysical scenario in combination with nuclear physics aspects .",
    "2 ) the scatter for elements between strontium and silver ( @xmath4 ) indicates an additional contribution for the production of those _ lighter heavy elements_. this contribution may be associated with a weak r - process ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) involving charged - particle reactions  @xcite .",
    "the strong scatter of r - process contributions in comparison to regular supernova products like iron , measured e.g. , by the eu / fe - ratio , seems to give an indication that strong r - process events are rare but efficient when they occur  @xcite .",

    "[ sed : sum ] .    before immersing us into the neutrino - driven wind ,",
    "lets summarize a few useful concepts that will be used along the review .",
    "matter consisting of a composition of ionized nuclei can be described by the corresponding mass fractions @xmath6 summing up to unity ( @xmath7 ) . a quantity",
    "which is not weighted with the total mass but rather proportional to the number density of a nucleus is the abundance @xmath8 . if the mass density of a nucleus @xmath9 is divided by the mass of a nucleus @xmath10 , one obtains directly the number density @xmath11 , as @xmath12 in the appropriate units .",
    "the total abundance of electrons ( or also called electron fraction ) is identical to the total abundance of protons ( in free protons and nuclei ) @xmath13 and equivalent to the total proton - to - nucleon ratio @xmath14 .",
    "abundance changes ( @xmath15 ) can be described by differential equations for each nuclear abundance @xmath16 , related to decays , fusion reactions and three body reactions ( a sequence of two fusion reactions involving an intermediate particle - unstable nucleus , i.e. with a vanishing half - life ) , for details see ref .",
    "reactions with a ( thermal or non - thermal ) distribution of photons / neutrinos can be written like decay reactions ( after integrating over the photon or neutrino energy spectra ) with a decay `` constant '' having a temperature ( or more complex ) dependence .",
    "when a massive star collapses at the end of its live , gravitational energy is transformed into internal energy .",
    "this leads to a hot proto - neutron star with initial temperatures of @xmath17  mev . at this high temperature , neutrinos",
    "dominate the cooling and carry away the gravitational binding energy .",
    "inside of the newly born neutron star , densities are very high and neutrinos are thus trapped .",
    "neutrinos diffuse from the interior of the neutron star and can freely stream when their mean free path becomes comparable to the neutron star radius .",
    "the region from where neutrinos escape , the neutrinosphere , is different for every flavor and energy as neutrino - matter interactions are strongly energy dependent .",
    "the neutrinosphere region is located at the outer layers of the proto - neutron star where density and temperature present steep gradients .",
    "some of the escaping neutrinos deposit energy in the matter of this region mainly via charged - particle reactions : @xmath18 this injection of energy in the outer layers of the proto - neutron star causes that a significant fraction of mass of the outer neutron star layers is blown off in a _ neutrino - driven wind_.    the neutrino - driven wind sets in after the explosion and lasts for several seconds and even minutes .",
    "this deleptonization eventually leads to a cold neutron star , transparent to neutrinos , and to a significant amount of matter being ejected during the first 1020  s after the explosion .",
    "this initial cooling phase or neutrino - driven wind has been first described by duncan et al .",
    "( 1986 )  @xcite , a detailed study of the later cooling phase can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    during the kelvin - helmholtz cooling time scale",
    "( i.e. , the time it takes to radiate away the gravitational energy ) the neutrino luminosities and energies and also the neutron star radius and mass change only slowly .",
    "therefore , neutrino - driven winds can be assumed to be steady state outflows @xcite described by the following equations : @xmath19 for the mass , momentum , and energy conservation , respectively .",
    "here @xmath20 is a constant mass outflow , @xmath21 is the rest mass density , @xmath22 is the outflow velocity , @xmath23 is the mass of the neutron star , @xmath24 is the energy generation rate produced by neutrinos , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are pressure and specific energy that account for non - relativistic nucleons , relativistic electrons and positrons , and photon radiation @xcite .",
    "there are two types of solutions for these equations with physical meaning .",
    "1 ) for high mass outflows the velocity reaches the sound speed and shock region and neutron star are sonically disconnected .",
    "this is known as wind and it is schematically illustrated by the blue line in fig .",

    "2 ) when the velocity does not attain the critical sound speed , we talk about a breeze solution ( green lines , fig .",

    "-([eq : wind_eq_3 ] ) .",
    "the blue line corresponds to the physical supersonic solution that crosses the sonic point .",
    "some of the physical subsonic solutions are shown by the green lines and labeled as breeze .",
    "the grey lines represent mathematical solutions without physical meaning . ]",
    "steady state and analytic models have been developed to better understand neutrino - driven winds and their potential as r - process site , after the promising results of woosley et al .",
    "( 1994 ) @xcite .",
    "qian & woosley ( 1996 ) @xcite identified by means of an analytic model the wind parameters that are key for the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements .",
    "they assumed the wind to be a steady - state spherical outflow with boundaries at the neutrinosphere and supernova shock .",
    "seconds after the explosion the shock is at large radii and there are only small and slow variations in the global neutrino characteristics and the properties of the neutron star .",
    "these support the steady - state assumption and permit to describe the wind independently of details how the shock gets launched .",
    "the impact of neutron star mass ( @xmath27 ) and radius ( @xmath28 ) , and the neutrino luminosity ( @xmath29 ) and energy spectra ( @xmath30 ) on the wind parameters can be understood with the following relations  @xcite : @xmath31 the mass outflow ( @xmath20 ) gives the amount of ejected mass and thus the contribution of neutrino - driven winds to the enrichment of heavy elements in the universe , provided the conditions in these mass zones support their nucleosynthesis .",
    "the wind entropy ( @xmath32 ) and the expansion time scale ( @xmath33 ) are critical parameters to determine the composition of the ejecta .",
    "the reactions responsible for the synthesis of heavy nuclei start at @xmath34c which is produced from @xmath35he via three body reactions ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : nuc_par ] ) .",
    "the efficiency of these reactions depends on the range of temperatures and densities . in a radiation - dominated environment",
    "the entropy is given by a relation including temperature and density : @xmath36 .",
    "this is proportional to the photon - to - baryon ratio @xcite . at high entropies",
    "the temperature is also high for densities which permit three body reactions .",
    "high temperature causes photo - dissociation and prevents the formation of seed elements ( sect .",
    "[ sec : def ] ) .",
    "the expansion time scale also controls the efficiency of the three body reactions .",
    "if the expansion is very fast , alpha particles do not have sufficient time to combine into seed nuclei .",
    "therefore , entropy and expansion time scale are key to determine how alpha particles contribute to form seed nuclei .",
    "an additional wind parameter is the electron fraction which does not depend on the total neutrino luminosities and energies but on the relative contributions of neutrinos and antineutrinos to these quantities . in a neutrino - driven wind the two forward reactions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nue_n ] ) and ( [ eq : nuebar_p ] ) dominate and cause , e.g. , the proton abundance time variation to be @xmath37 in case of a weak equilibrium , i.e. , an equilibrium of production of neutrons and protons by these weak interaction reactions , we have @xmath38 .",
    "this gives a relation between @xmath39 and @xmath40 to be @xmath41 . on the other hand , the electron fraction @xmath42 ( the electron to nucleon ratio , being in charge equilibrium equal to the proton to nucleon ratio )",

    "the neutron - proton mass difference is @xmath51  mev . in order to have a neutron - rich wind , i.e. , @xmath52",
    ", the neutrino and antineutrino energies have to approximately fulfill @xmath53  mev .",
    "indeed , this is not found in recent spherically symmetric simulations @xcite where the neutrino outflow stays proton - rich . under such conditions",
    "the rapid neutron capture process to form the heaviest nuclei can not occur , ruling out the spherically symmetric neutrino - driven winds as its astrophysical site . however , this conditions become very favourable for the @xmath5-process  @xcite .    here",
    "we would like to shortly summarize the historical evolution of research efforts for the wind electron fraction .",
    "improvements in the neutrino reactions have resulted in a reduction of the electron antineutrino energy from the first simulations by wilson to the modern ones @xcite .",
    "moreover , all neutrino flavours have very similar energies which leads to proton - rich conditions since the requirement @xmath54  mev is not fulfilled .",
    "this is illustrated in the neutrino two - color plot presented in fig .",

    "the black contours correspond to @xmath57 and the grey contours to @xmath58.,width=302 ]    neutrino energies depend on the temperature of the medium in the region where neutrinos decouple from matter .",
    "this region is known as the neutrinosphere and its location is different for each neutrino flavor and energy . inside of the neutrinosphere , neutrinos are in thermal and chemical equilibrium mainly through charged - current reactions ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nue_n])-([eq : nuebar_p ] ) ) . outside the neutrinosphere , neutrinos escape and",
    "their temperature stays almost constant and approximately equal to the temperature at their neutrinosphere . because neutrons are more abundant than protons in the neutron star , electron neutrinos continue interacting up to larger radii and thus to lower temperatures than antineutrinos ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the muon and tau ( anti)neutrinos interact only via neutral - current reactions and decouple at smaller radii , therefore their energies are larger . during the first seconds after the explosion , the proto - neutron star deleptonizes and the amount of protons in the outer layers decreases . the electron antineutrino energies are thus expected to be higher than the electron neutrino energies . however , this simple picture is not valid and the spectra of electron neutrinos and antineutrinos are rather similar due to neutral - current reactions that act in a similar way on all neutrino flavors and become also important as the neutron star cools  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the latest investigations of charged - current neutrino opacity @xcite indicate that these cross sections can significantly change due to in medium modifications  @xcite . in the early supernova explosion phase ,",
    "mean field effects have a minor effect on the neutrino spectra because neutrinospheres are not at very high densities . in the region",
    "where mean field effects are relevant neutrinos are trapped .",
    "in contrast , during the neutrino - driven wind phase , neutrinospheres are at high densities ( @xmath60 ) and mean field effects are not negligible although they are not included in current supernova simulations  @xcite . as suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite , the consideration of in medium modifications could change the electron fraction towards more neutron - rich conditions ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "however , the exact @xmath42 value depends on medium correlations and the equation of state , both of which are still uncertain . in any case",
    ", these new results rise an exciting possibility of linking the wind nucleosynthesis to the behaviour of matter and neutrinos under extreme conditions in the proto - neutron star .",
    "in addition , neutrino oscillations ( see sect .  [ sec : add_ingredients ] for more details ) and the presence of light clusters such as @xmath62h , @xmath63h , @xmath63he @xcite also may change the electron fraction of the wind .",
    "a mass elements is ejected from the outer layers of the proto neutron star due to the energy deposited by neutrino .",
    "the nucleosynthesis in neutrino - driven winds starts at high temperatures and densities which keep the matter in nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) , i.e. , there is a balance ( i.e. , chemical equilibrium ) between nuclear reactions producing seed nuclei @xmath64 and photo - dissociation destroying those nuclei into nucleons : @xmath65 this leads to a relation between the chemical potentials , @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , the composition can be calculated utilizing boltzmann distributions for nuclei , neutrons , and protons .",
    "the composition is thus uniquely determined by the temperature , density , and electron fraction , being environment parameters : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the nuclear partition function , @xmath69 is the binding energy , @xmath70 is the planck constant , @xmath71 is the avogadro number , and @xmath21 is the baryon density . equation ( [ eq : y_nse ] ) indicates that the presence of a nucleus depends strongly on @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 . for moderate temperatures iron - group nuclei",
    "are favored in nse because of their large binding energies .",
    "in contrast , at high temperatures many energetic photons are available , and the result is a gas consisting mostly of nucleons and alpha particles in which it is difficult to build up heavy nuclei because they are quickly photo - dissociated ( see ref .",
    "very high densities would favor in contrast very heavy nuclei .",
    "the nse composition at high temperatures is dominated by alpha particles and nucleons .",
    "only when the temperature drops , the alpha particles recombine and form seed nuclei at expenses of nucleons whose abundances drop rapidly .",
    "as the expansion continues and matter cools , slower reactions fall out of equilibrium . at the breakdown of nse ( @xmath75  k ) for low densities , as occurring in the neutrino wind ,",
    "the composition is dominated by alpha particles and one talks about alpha - rich freeze out .",
    "alpha particles combine into seed nuclei starting with the triple - alpha reaction ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "if the amount of free neutrons is not negligible , @xmath34c forms also via @xmath77he ( @xmath78 ) @xmath79be ( @xmath80 ) @xmath34c  @xcite .",
    "these reactions depend strongly on the density and can be hindered if the expansion is very fast , i.e. , if the density does not stay for sufficiently long time in the range where these three body reactions are effective ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the production of @xmath34c is followed by the alpha process @xcite which consist of a sequence of alpha captures ( including @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 reactions ) combined with @xmath85 and @xmath86 reactions depending on the neutron - richness of the wind . these charged - particle reactions ( cpr )",
    "continue until temperatures are too low to overcome the coulomb barrier of nuclei ( @xmath87  k ) .",
    "the composition at cpr freeze - out consists mainly of alpha particles together with a few seed nuclei ( formed by the alpha - process ) and free nucleons .",
    "the proton or neutron richness as well as the ratio of nucleons and seed nuclei depends on the wind parameters and will determine the nucleosynthesis processes taking place in neutrino - driven winds .",
    "for example , the r - process can build heavy elements up to uranium if the neutron - to - seed ratio ( @xmath88 ) is sufficiently high . assuming the average mass number of seed nuclei is @xmath89 , the neutron - to - seed indicates the heaviest elements ( with mass number @xmath90 ) that can be synthesized : @xmath91 .",

    ", the behaviour of density and temperature after the wind termination may lead to variations of the neutron density , allowing to move to stability not only by @xmath109-decay but also by neutron captures  @xcite .",
    "this is very important because it implies that matter can cross to the neutron - rich side of stability and even produce neutron - rich isotopes .",

    "while @xmath189 and @xmath33-neutrinos are dominated by neutral current reactions , and pure scattering is not dominating the energy deposition nor changing the composition , electron neutrinos and anti - neutrinos act also via charged - current capture reactions ( with strong energy deposition ) which also determine the overall proton - to - nucleon ratio via @xmath190 and @xmath191 . due to the energy dependence ( and q - values ) of the neutrino and anti - neutrino cross sections ,",
    "the composition becomes neutron - rich if average energies of anti - neutrinos are larger than those of neutrinos by 4@xmath192 , if both are characterized by similar total luminosities .",
    "more generally also the luminosities of both species enter .",
    "early calculations in the 90s resulted in substantial mean energy differences between anti - neutrinos and neutrinos , caused a neutron - rich composition and high entropies of the ejected matter .",
    "the entropy @xmath193 , total proton - to - nucleon ratio @xmath42 , and the expansion time scale @xmath33 of ejected matter are the key properties for the composition of the ejecta ( possibly still modified by late time behavior not corresponding to free expansions if matter experiences reverse shocks due to collision with matter ejected in the prior supernova explosion ) .",
    "these early calculations predicted a large neutron - to - seed ratio after freeze - out of charged particles reactions , providing the basis for a strong r - process and the production of heavy nuclei up to th and u. this made the neutrino wind the most promising site for the r - process nuclei found in the solar composition and indicated a very strong production of r - process matter in the early galaxy , as massive stars producing supernovae are the fastest evolving species and the earliest polluters of the interstellar medium ( consistent with observations of low metallicity stars ) .",
    "these investigations also caused a large amount of parametrized calculations , studying r - process properties as a function of the three key parameters @xmath193 , @xmath42 , and @xmath33 .",
    "more recent core collapse simulations with late - time evolutions up to 10  s after core collapse , and improved micro physics and neutrino transport , resulted in anti - neutrino and neutrino spectra with smaller mean energy differences , and consequently a proton - rich composition of ejecta .",
    "this gave rise to a new process , the @xmath1p - process , where in a first step the more proton - rich conditions produce essential abundances of @xmath135ge ( decaying into @xmath135zn , thus going beyond @xmath181ni decaying into @xmath181fe ) which could explain that zn is co - produced with fe - group nuclei , as observed in low - metallicity stars .",
    "in a second step portions of @xmath135ge can be processed further up to a=90 nuclei , due to overcoming its long beta - decay half - life via an @xmath173-reaction with neutrons , produced by anti - neutrino captures on the remaining free protons in this proton - rich environment .",
    "this opened an option to explain abundances of light p - nuclei .",
    "recent calculations , including medium effects for neutrons and protons , which lead to effective q - values corrected by chemical potential differences have apparently again provided a change .",
    "the full consequences of this effect are not fully analyzed , yet , and surprises are still expected . in any case , both proton - rich and slightly neutron - rich conditions are adequate to synthesized lighter heavy elements such as sr , y , zr .",
    "their abundances have been attributed before to a not - yet understood lighter ( heavy ) element primary process ( lepp ) which is required in galactic evolution based on low - metallicity observations .",
    "in addition , the final understanding will probably only arise with the full understanding of core collapse supernova explosions from 3d hydrodynamical modeling .",
    "the latter is well on its way , but not yet established .",
    "thus , the neutrino wind properties will probably still provide further surprises and possibly even contain matter with properties covering all cases discussed above , due to the time evolution of neutrino spectra and luminosities .",
