    "there is now elastic electron - deuteron scattering data determining the electric form - factor @xmath1 up to @xmath2gev/@xmath3@xcite , the magnetic form - factor @xmath4 up to @xmath5gev/@xmath3@xcite , and the tensor - polarization form - factor @xmath6 up to @xmath7gev/@xmath3@xcite .",
    "these data restrict orbital and spin components of the deuteron wave function at scales as small as 0.2 fm , at which distance quark degrees - of - freedom ( d.o.f . ) , isobar components and meson - exchange currents all have a significant role .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix boundary condition method@xcite provides a hybrid quark / gluon and hadron model , incorporating all the above contributions .",
    "only a few of the parameters are not predetermined by data independent of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction and symmetry requirements .",
    "the remaining few are almost all determined by nn scattering data .",
    "essentially one parameter is free to determine the behavior of the three independent elastic electron - deuteron form - factors ( edff ) over the large range of momentum - transfers , @xmath8 .",
    "this parameter determines the relative amount of @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the deuteron , which profoundly affects the @xmath8 dependence of the spin and convective currents@xcite .",
    "the nn scattering is not sensitive to the ratio , but only to the sum .    following a review of the @xmath0-matrix method and its application to the nn system",
    ", three specific models for the @xmath11 , @xmath12 sector , of different levels of completeness , will be compared with the nn scattering and edff data . from these",
    "one can extrapolate to a model that represents all the data .",
    "at high momentum - transfer ( short range ) the running coupling constant of qcd is small , permitting a perturbative description in terms of current quarks and gluons ( asymptotic freedom ) . at low momentum - transfer ( long range )",
    "nonperturbative effects produce clustering into color singlet hadrons ( confinement ) .",
    "the transition between these extremes has been shown to occur over a small range of the running coupling constant@xcite , and therefore over a short distance .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix method@xcite is well suited to this situation in which two regions , each well represented by a different approximate hamiltonian , have their wave functions connected by a boundary condition at the separating surface .    for the qcd application , in which confinement",
    "requires the quark wave function to be small at the transition boundary , the suitable form of the @xmath0-matrix equation is@xcite @xmath13 with @xmath14 in which @xmath15 is the exterior wave function for hadron - pair channel @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the total energy , the poles @xmath18 are the energies of a complete set of internal states vanishing at @xmath19 , and the residues @xmath20 are given by absolute squares of the internal wave function derivatives at the boundaries .",
    "thus the @xmath21 are meromorphic functions with real poles of positive residue .",
    "the residues can be expressed as @xmath22 where the fractional parentage coefficients @xmath23 are geometric coefficients expressed in terms of clebsch - gordon coefficients of the spin / flavor / color space of the given quark configuration .",
    "therefore only the @xmath24 , representing the effective constant of distant poles and the pole at infinity , are free parameters .    the hadrons at @xmath25 interact via hadron exchange potentials , as given by known hadron masses and coupling constants fixed by independent experiments or symmetry conditions .",
    "the separation radius , @xmath19 , must be within the range of asymptotic freedom ( @xmath26 of the equilibrium radius of the interior bag model ) because of the sensitivity of @xmath20 to the derivatives at @xmath19 of the internal wave function .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) also requires that @xmath19 satisfy @xmath27 . using the low energy data",
    ", the latter condition fixes the value of @xmath19 with some precision , giving a value consistent with the first condition for the cloudy bag model , but not for the mit bag model@xcite , ruling out the latter for the multi - hadron domain .",
    "the cloudy bag model determines @xmath28  fm .",
    "the model then gives a good detailed fit to nn data for @xmath29  gev@xcite and also is consistent with some evidence for the lowest @xmath30 exotic resonance , @xmath31@xcite at 2.70 gev .",
    "these resonances , produced near the @xmath32-poles at @xmath18 correspond to multi - quark configurations other than the minimal @xmath33 and @xmath34 configurations .",
    "the lowest in the nn system is the @xmath11 , @xmath35 at 2.63 gev .",
    "the first @xmath32-pole in the nn system , corresponding to the @xmath36 ^ 6 $ ] configuration , is in the @xmath11 , @xmath35 state , 0.76 gev above the deuteron mass . as the width of the exotic resonance is only 0.03 gev , the @xmath37 are nearly constant .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that the interior wave function vanishes for constant @xmath32 , and the actual probability of being in the interior has been estimated to be @xmath38@xcite .",
    "this implies a large `` hole '' in the deuteron wave function , which has long been noted as a property of the edff and is also embodied in the effective `` hard core '' of nn scattering . in our model",
    "this apparent repulsion arises from the rapid change in the effective d.o.f . at @xmath19 .",
    "however at the energy @xmath18 there is `` matching '' of the interior and exterior wave functions , resulting in a substantial interior probability and a resonance .",
    "the fact that @xmath19 is 2 - 3 times larger than the cores of repulsive core models is compensated by the discontinuous increase of wave functions at @xmath19 , so that the experimental effective range parameters can be produced by both types of core effect .",
    "however the models differ at higher nn scattering energies for large @xmath8 edff .      in the @xmath11 , @xmath35 system , the nn @xmath39 and nn @xmath40 states",
    "are coupled to each other and to isobar channels by meson exchange potentials as well as the @xmath32-matrix .",
    "because of their low threshold mass and strong tensor coupling , the @xmath41 , @xmath10 and @xmath42 channels are most important and are included in all our models .",
    "nn @xmath39 and @xmath41 states have nonvanishing @xmath23 with the @xmath36 ^ 6 $ ] quark configuration , contributing to the @xmath32-pole residue .",
    "the nn@xmath43 channel also has a low threshold , and with its large width is of next importance to the deuteron .",
    "but over the energy range which includes the first exotics , other channels are also of some importance and the @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are included in our recent work .",
    "these channels modify the best choice of @xmath24 for the lower threshold channels , but have negligible components in the deuteron .",
    "the @xmath24 are sharply restricted by fitting the nn scattering data , which in the deuteron sector requires a fit to the @xmath47 phase parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath48 and @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath29  gev .",
    "for the models @xmath52 and @xmath53@xcite , which have only nn and @xmath54 channels , the lower energy behavior of the @xmath48 s and @xmath51 determine the nn sector @xmath37 , while the energy dependence for 0.4 gev @xmath55 0.8 gev fixes those coupling the nn and @xmath41 sectors , and the nn to the sum of @xmath10 and @xmath9 sectors .",
    "the last two have the same threshold behavior , affecting the elastic scattering in the same way .",
    "only detailed @xmath56-production data could separate them , so the ratio is free to adjust to the edff .",
    "the magnetic form factor @xmath8-dependence is very sensitive to the ratio because of the opposite spin and convection currents of these states@xcite .",
    "the model @xmath52 did not consider quark configurations@xcite . without @xmath32-poles",
    "the best choice of separation radius was @xmath57  fm .",
    "model @xmath53 included the lowest @xmath32-pole with @xmath28  fm as discussed above .",
    "as shown previously@xcite , @xmath52 and @xmath53 give equivalent fits to the @xmath48 s while case @xmath53 is a better fit to @xmath51 .",
    "30ex    [ fig:1 ]      in previous work@xcite , the edff for models @xmath52 and @xmath53 were calculated with the nonrelativistic , coupled channel impulse approximation ( ia ) and the meson - exchange current ( mec ) terms of @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , `` pair '' corrections and the @xmath61 term to first relativistic order . for the ia",
    "the isobar form factors are assumed proportional to the nucleon electromagnetic form - factors . in all cases",
    "the mec corrections to the isobar channels are neglected .",
    "both hhler et al.@xcite ( ho ) and gari - krmpelmann@xcite ( gk ) nucleon form factors were used .",
    "the results ( figs .  3 - 6 of @xcite ) are seen to be a good to @xmath1 for the ho choice and to @xmath4 for the gk choice . this is not inconsistent as @xmath1 is dominated by the nucleon electric form - factor and @xmath4 by the nucleon magnetic form - factor .",
    "the @xmath6 predictions were consistent with the very low @xmath8 experimental results available at the time .",
    "here we present , versus the extended data range of the edff , the results of models @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath62 where the first order relativistic correction has been added to the impulse approximation and the second order relativistic corrections have been included in the mec@xcite . for model @xmath62",
    "the ratio of @xmath63 to @xmath64 coupling to the nn sector was guided by the @xmath52 and @xmath53 model ratios .",
    "it has not yet been optimized to the data .",
    "also the balance of @xmath54 and @xmath65 coupling to nn and the value of the @xmath66 magnetic moment , unknown from independent data , have not been varied .",
    "table  [ tab:1 ] shows the results of model @xmath62 for the static properties of the deuteron . for models @xmath52 and @xmath53 the results are as stated in @xcite except for a small relativistic change in @xmath67 .",
    "@lcccccccc & @xmath68(mev ) & @xmath69 & @xmath70 & @xmath71&@xmath72 & @xmath73(%)&@xmath74&@xmath75 + model @xmath62 & 2.2247 & 5.21 & .006 & 3.24 & 1.79 & 0.71 & .273 & .860 + exp @xmath76 & 2.2246 & & & & & & .286 & .857 +    fig .",
    "2 fig.3    [ fig:3 ]    @xmath1 is shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that model @xmath62 with either choice of nucleon form - factors fits the data reasonably well for @xmath77 ( gev/@xmath78)@xmath79 , but is only large enough for larger @xmath80 when the gk choice is made .",
    "models @xmath52 and @xmath53 on the other hand are better with the ho choice for @xmath81 ( gev/@xmath82 ) , but at 6 ( gev/@xmath82 ) only model @xmath83 with gk is large enough .",
    "@xmath6 is shown in fig .",
    "3 . for the momentum transfer range",
    "there is negligible sensitivity to the choice of nucleon form - factors , as these cancel in the ratio of quadrupole to monopole electric amplitudes which dominates @xmath84 .",
    "the result is however very sensitive to the model used .",
    "the simple constant @xmath32-matrix model , @xmath52 , gives a good fit over the whole range of @xmath8 .",
    "model @xmath53 puts the maximum of @xmath84 at much too small a momentum transfer .",
    "this is related to the large amplitude ofthe @xmath85 , @xmath54 states in this model .",
    "model @xmath62 , with intermediate @xmath54 components , has the maximum of @xmath84 between that of models @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath4 for models @xmath52 and @xmath53 is similar to that of @xcite with minima at slightly smaller @xmath8 . however the minimum of @xmath4 for model @xmath62 is at much too small a value @xmath86  ( gev/@xmath3 ) .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix boundary condition model @xmath62 , with all the relevant isobar channels , reproduces the @xmath47 scattering phases well up to @xmath29  gev .",
    "it also reproduces very well the static properties of the deuteron and @xmath1 for @xmath87  ( gev/@xmath3 .",
    "it does not fit @xmath6 as well as the simpler model @xmath52 ( although it is better than model @xmath53 ) , and has the first minimum of @xmath4 at much too small a value . to correct the full model ( @xmath62 ) for @xmath4",
    ", the ratio of the @xmath88 to @xmath10 couplings to the nn sector needs to be varied . that , and perhaps a further substitution of @xmath66 coupling for @xmath54 coupling to the nn sector may also correct the fit to the maximum of @xmath6",
