    "turing instability constitutes a universal paradigm for the spontaneous generation of spatially organized patterns @xcite .",
    "it formally applies to a wide category of phenomena , which can be modeled via the so called reaction diffusion schemes .",
    "these are mathematical models that describe the coupled evolution of spatially distributed species , as driven by microscopic reactions and freely diffusing in the embedding medium .",
    "diffusion can potentially seed the instability by perturbing the mean - field homogeneous state , through an activator - inhibitor mechanism , and so yielding to the emergence of patched , spatially inhomogeneous , density distribution @xcite .",
    "the realm of application of the turing ideas encompasses different fields , ranging from chemistry to biology , from ecology to physics .",
    "the most astonishing examples , as already evidenced in turing original paper , are perhaps encountered in the context of morphogenesis , the branch of embryology devoted to investigating the development of patterns and forms in biology @xcite .    beyond the qualitative agreement ,",
    "one difficulty in establishing a quantitative link between theory and empirical observations has to do with the strict conditions for which the organized turing patterns are predicted to occur . in particular , and with reference to simple predator - prey competing populations ,",
    "the relative degree of diffusivity of the interacting species has to be large according to the theory prescriptions , and at variance with the direct experimental evidence .",
    "moreover , patterns formation appears to be rather robust in nature , as opposed to the turing predictive scenario , where a fine tuning of the parameters is often necessary .    in @xcite",
    "it was demonstrated that collective temporal oscillations can spontaneously emerge in a model of population dynamics , as due to a resonance mechanism that amplifies the unavoidable intrinsic noise , originating from the discreteness of the system . later on an extension of the model was proposed @xcite so to explicitly account for the notion of space .",
    "it was in particulary shown that the number density of the interacting species oscillates both in time and space , a macroscopic effect resulting from the amplification of the stochastic fluctuations about the time independent solution of the deterministic equations .",
    "more recently , butler and goldenfeld @xcite proved that persistent spatial patterns and temporal oscillations induced by demographic noise , can develop in a simple predator - prey model of plankton - herbivore dynamics .",
    "the model considered by the authors of @xcite exhibits a turing order in the mean field theory .",
    "the effect of intrinsic noise translates however into an enlargement of the parameter region yielding to the turing mechanism , when compared to its homologous domain predicted within the conventional linear stability analysis .",
    "this is an individual based effect , which has to be accommodated for in any sensible model of natural phenomena , and which lacks in the turing interpretative scenario , that formally applies to the idealized continuum limit .",
    "interestingly , as reported in @xcite , the discreteness of the scrutinized medium can yield to robust spatio - temporal structures , also when the system does not undergo turing order in its mean - field , deterministic version .",
    "starting from this setting , we present the results of our investigations carried out for a spatial version of the brusselator model , which we shall be introducing in the forthcoming section . as opposed to the analysis in @xcite",
    ", we will operate within the so called urn protocol , where individual elements belonging to the inspected species are assumed to populate an assigned container .",
    "the proposed formulation of the brusselator differs from the one customarily reported in the literature .",
    "additional terms are in fact obtained building on the underlying microscopic picture .",
    "these latter contributions are generally omitted , an assumption that we interpret as working in a diluted limit .",
    "interestingly , the phase diagram of the homogeneous ( aspatial ) version of the model , is remarkably different from its diluted analogue , a fact we will substantiate in the following .",
    "furthermore , when constructing the mean - field dynamics from the assigned microscopic rules , one recovers non - trivial cross diffusive terms , as previously remarked in @xcite .",
    "these are derived within a self - consistent analysis and ultimately stands from assuming a finite carrying capacity in a given spatial patch . as such , they potentially bear an important physical meaning which deserves to be further elucidated .",
    "this scheme , alternative to conventional reaction - diffusion models , calls for an extension of the original turing condition , that we will derive in the following .",
    "this is the second result of the paper .",
    "finally , by making use of the van kampen system size expansion , we are able to estimate the power spectrum of fluctuations analytically and so delineate the boundaries of the spatially ordered domain in the relevant parameters space . as already remarked in @xcite , the role played by the intimate grainess can impact dramatically the turing vision , returning a generalized scenario that holds promise to bridge the gap with observations .",
    "the brusselator model represents a paradigmatic example of an autocatalytic chemical reaction .",
    "this scheme was originally devised in 1971 by prigogine and glandsdorff @xcite and quickly gained its reputation as the prototype model for oscillating chemical reaction of the belosouv - zhabotinsky @xcite type . in the following",
    "we shall consider a slightly modified version of the original formulation , where the number of reactants @xmath0 and @xmath1 is conserved and totals in @xmath2 , including the empties , here called @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "moreover we will consider a spatially extended system composed of @xmath4 cells , each of size @xmath5 , where reactions are supposed to occur",
    ". implies imposing a finite carrying capacity in each micro - cell .",
    "this procedure defines the so called `` urn protocol '' , and allows for a technically easier implementation of the van kampen expansion as presented in @xcite . on the other hand , and besides technical reasons , assuming a limited capacity in space is a reasonable physical request .",
    "it is therefore interesting to explore how such a choice reflects on the subsequent analysis .",
    "let us anticipate that the presence of the empties @xmath3 will sensibly modify the mean - field phase diagram of the brusselator model , as concerns both the homogeneous and the spatial dynamics .",
    "conversely , the observation that the turing region gets enlarged by demographic noise holds true , irrespectively of the specific urn representation here invoked @xcite .",
    "] practically each cell hosts a replica of the brusselator system : the molecules are however allowed to migrate between adjacent cells , which in turn implies an effective spatial coupling imputed to the microscopic molecular diffusion .",
    "a periodic geometry is also assumed so to restore the translational invariance .",
    "although the calculation can be carried out in _ any _ space dimension @xmath6 ( see @xcite ) we shall here mainly refer to the @xmath7 case study , so to privilege the clarity of the message over technical complications .",
    "it should be however remarked that our conclusions are general and remain unchanged in extended spatial settings .",
    "mathematically the model can be cast in the form : @xmath8 where the index @xmath9 runs from @xmath10 to @xmath4 and identifies the cell where the molecules are located .",
    "the autocatalytic species of interest to us are @xmath11 and @xmath12 . the elements @xmath13 and @xmath14 work as enzymatic activators , and keep constant in number .",
    "as such , they can be straightforwardly absorbed into the definition of the reaction rates .",
    "let us label with @xmath15 ( resp .",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 ) the number of element of type @xmath11 ( resp .",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath18 ) populating cell @xmath9 . then , assuming @xmath2 to identify the maximum number of available cases within each cell , one gets @xmath19 a condition which can be exploited to reduce the actual number of dynamical variables to two .",
    "the dynamics of the model is ultimately related to studying the coupled interaction between the discrete species @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the migration between neighbors cells is specified through : @xmath20 assuming a perfect mixing in each individual cell @xmath9 , the transition probabilities @xmath21 read @xcite : @xmath22 where according to the standard convention , the rightmost input specifies the original state and the other entry stems for the final one .",
    "in addition , the migration mechanism between neighbors cell is controlled by : @xmath23 where the positive constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 quantify the diffusion ability of the two species and @xmath26 stands for the number of first neighbors . to complete the notation setting",
    ", we introduce the @xmath4-dimensional vectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 to identify the state of the system .",
    "their @xmath29 components respectively read @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the aforementioned system is intrinsically stochastic . at time",
    "@xmath30 there exists a finite probability to observe the system in the state characterized by @xmath31 and @xmath28 .",
    "let us label @xmath32 such a probability .",
    "one can then write down the so called master equation , a differential equation which governs the dynamical evolution of the quantity @xmath33 .",
    "the master equation for the case at hand takes the form @xmath34 \\biggr ] p(\\textbf{n } , \\textbf{m } , t ) , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where use has been made of the definition of the step operators @xmath35 and where the second sum in equation ( [ spme2 ] ) runs on first neighbors @xmath36 .",
    "equation ( [ spme2 ] ) is exact , the underlying dynamics being a markov process .",
    "the master equation ( [ spme2 ] ) contains information on both the ideal mean  field dynamics ( formally recovered in the limit of diverging system size ) and the finite @xmath2 corrections . to bring into evidence those two components",
    ", one can proceed according to the prescriptions of van kampen @xcite , and write the normalized concentration relative to the interacting species as : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 stand for the stochastic contribution .",
    "the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) is motivated by the central limit theorem and holds provided the dynamics evolve far from the absorbing boundaries ( extinction condition ) . here @xmath40 plays the role of a small parameter and paves the way to a perturbative analysis of the master equation . at the leading order one",
    "recovers the mean  field equations , while the fluctuations are characterized as next to leading corrections .",
    "the following section is devoted to discussing the system dynamics , according to its mean  field approximation .",
    "performing the perturbative calculation one ends up with the following system of partial differential equations for the @xmath41 and @xmath42 in cell @xmath9 :    @xmath43 , \\\\ \\partial_\\tau \\psi_i = & \\;b \\phi _ i - c \\phi _ i^2 \\psi _",

    "@xmath25 quantify the ability of the molecules to exit / enter a given patch of size @xmath5 .",
    "when @xmath5 gets reduced , @xmath24 ( resp .",
    "@xmath25 ) should correspondingly increase , so that the quantity @xmath52 ( resp .",
    "@xmath53 ) converges to a finite value ( the physical diffusivity ) when the limit @xmath54 is taken .",
    "this latter value is in turn the one that enters the continuous equations ( [ spmf1 ] ) .",
    "] as also remarked in @xcite , cross diffusive terms of the type @xmath55 appear in the mean - field equations , as a relic of the microscopic rules of interaction .",
    "more precisely , they arise as a direct consequence of the finite carrying capacity hypothesis .",
    "this observation materializes in a crucial difference with respect to the heuristically proposed reaction diffusion schemes and points to the need for an extended turing analysis , i.e. derive the generalized conditions yielding to organized spatial structures . before addressing this specific issue , we start by discussing the homogeneous fixed point of ( [ spmf1 ] ) . from hereon",
    "we will set @xmath56 , a choice already made in @xcite for the original brusselator model and which will make possible to visualize our conclusion in the reference plan @xmath57 for any fixed ratio of the diffusivity amount @xmath25 and @xmath24 .",
    "plugging @xmath56 into equations ( [ spmf1 ] ) and looking for homogeneous solutions implies : @xmath58    as an important remark we notice that in the diluted limit @xmath59 , the system tends to the mean - field of the original brusselator model , as e.g. reported in @xcite . for a proper tuning of the chemical parameters ( assigning significantly different strength )",
    "one can prove that , if initialized so to verify the diluted limit , the system stays diluted all along its subsequent evolution . as a corollary , the diluted solution is contained in the formulation of the brusselator here considered , this latter being therefore regarded as a sound generalization of the former . notice that when operating under diluted conditions , the cross diffusive terms appearing in the spatial equations ( [ spmf1 ] ) can be neglected and the standard reaction - diffusion scheme recovered .",
    "again , let us emphasize that it is the finite carrying capacity assumption that modifies the mean - field description .    system ( [ mf2 ] ) admits three fixed points , namely : @xmath60    the first of the above corresponds to the extinction of the species @xmath0 : it exists for any choice of the freely changing parameters @xmath61 and corresponds to a stable attractor for the dynamics .",
    "this solution is not present in the original brusselator mean  field equations and its origin can be traced back to the role played by the limited capacity of the container .",
    "the remaining two fixed points are respectively a saddle point and a ( non trivial ) stable attractor .",
    "they both manifest when the condition @xmath62 is fulfilled .",
    "the saddle point partitions the available phase space into two domains , each defining the basin of attraction of the stable points . when @xmath63 a saddle - node bifurcation occurs : the fixed points @xmath64 and @xmath65 collide to eventually disappear .",
    "the finite carrying capacity that follows the  urn representation \" of the brusselator dynamics destroys the limit cycle solution which is instead found in its celebrated classical analogue @xcite : no periodic solutions are found in the mean - field approximation , unless the diluted limit is considered .",
    "the specific nature of fixed point @xmath65 changes as a function of the parameters @xmath57 , as illustrated in figure [ fig_phase_diag ] . in region",
    "i , it is a stable node , while in ii it is a stable spiral .",
    "region iii identifies the parameters values for which it disappears .",
    "we are here concerned with the stability of the homogeneous fixed point @xmath65 to inhomogeneous perturbation : can an instability develop and yield to organized turing - like spatial patterns ?     as a function of the parameters @xmath57 : in region i the fixed point is a stable node , while in ii it is a stable spiral .",
    "the dashed line @xmath63 delineates region iii where the fixed point disappears , following a saddle node bifurcation .",
    "[ fig_phase_diag ] ]      to answer the previous question one has to perform a linear stability analysis around the selected homogeneous solution @xmath66 , hereafter termed @xmath67 , accounting for the effect of non homogeneous perturbation .",
    "the formal development is closely inspired by the original turing calculation , but now the effects of cross diffusive terms need to be accommodated for .",
    "the technical details of the derivation are enclosed in the annexed appendix , where the most general problem is defined and inspected .",
    "we will here take advantage from the conclusion therein reached and present the results relative to the brusselator model . in this specific case @xmath56",
    ", the dispersion relation ( [ pol ] ) reads in particular : @xmath68^{\\frac{1}{2 } } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 the perturbation gets amplified if @xmath70 over a finite interval of @xmath71 values . the edges , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , of the interval are identified by imposing @xmath74 which returns the following results : @xmath75^{1 \\over 2},\\ ] ] where @xmath76    by making use of conditions as derived in the appendix , the predicted region for the turing instability is traced in the @xmath57 parameter space for an assigned ratio of mutual diffusivity , see figure [ fig1 ] . when compared to the conventional turing analysis , based on the heuristically hypothesized reaction diffusion scheme ( i.e. removing the cross terms in eq .",
    "( [ spmf1 ] ) ) , the region of inhomogeneous instability shrinks , the condition for spatial self - organization becoming even more peculiar than so far believed .    up to now",
    "we have carried out the analysis in the continuous mean - field scenario neglecting the role of finite size corrections .",
    "stochastic fluctuations can however amplify due to an inherent resonant mechanism and consequently give rise to a large scale spatial order , similar to that predicted within the turing interpretative picture @xcite .",
    "the following section is entirely devoted to clarifying this important point .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "spatially organized patterns are reported to occur in a large gallery of widespread applications and are currently interpreted by resorting to the paradigmatic turing picture .",
    "this vision , though successful , relies on a mean - field description of the relevant reaction diffusion schemes , often guessed on purely heuristic basis .",
    "an alternative scenario would require accounting for the intimate microscopic dynamics and so encapsulating the effect of the small scale grainess .",
    "this latter translates into stochastic fluctuations that , under specific conditions , can amplify and so give rise to organized spatio - temporal patterns . in this paper",
    "we have considered a microscopic model of brusselator , and shown that turing like patterns can indeed emerge beyond the parameter region predicted by the conventional turing theory and due to the role of finite size corrections to the mean - field idealized dynamics .",
    "this result is obtained via a system size expansion which enables us to return closed analytical expressions for the power spectra of fluctuations .",
    "our results agree with the conclusion reached in @xcite for another model and employing different analytical tools .",
    "organized patterns can therefore occur more easily than expected , an observation that can potentially help reconciling theory and observations .",
    "in particular we find stochastic turing patterns to emerge for @xmath77 , a condition for which turing order is prevented to occur .",

    "let us start by the generic set of partial differential equations :        assume that in absence of diffusion ( homogeneous setting ) the model tends towards a fixed point specified by @xmath67 .",
    "in other words , @xmath79 , do not depend over space variables .",
    "allowing for diffusion , and imposing @xmath80 , can make the system unstable to spatial perturbation . to clarify this point ,",
    "let us start by considering the jacobian matrix for @xmath81 : @xmath82 the fixed point @xmath67 is linearly stable if @xmath83 has positive determinant and negative trace : @xmath84 assuming to hold one can proceed with a linearization of ( with @xmath85 @xmath86 ) around @xmath67 and so looking for the sought condition of instability . define @xmath87 , then become @xmath88 define the eigenfunctions of the laplacian operator as : @xmath89 and write the solution to eq.([lineartur ] ) in the form : @xmath90 assume @xmath91 , or equivalently label with @xmath25 the ratio of the two diffusivities ( after proper rescaling of the rate coefficients ) . substituting ansatz into eq .",

    "the actual dispersion relation , @xmath99 in the main body of the paper , is the one that displays the largest real part .",
    "we notice that ( i ) @xmath100 is always positive as @xmath101 by definition ; ( ii ) @xmath102 as @xmath103 and @xmath104 are concentrations ; ( iii ) @xmath105 due to .",
