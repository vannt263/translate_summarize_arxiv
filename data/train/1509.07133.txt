    "tsc also exhibits unique physical signature along its surface . despite there is a bulk energy gap , the surface of a tsc hosts @xmath1 gapless majorana ( real ) fermion modes that are robust , in the single - body mean - field framework , to all symmetry and bulk gap preserving perturbations .",

    "this reduces the integer classification of tsc into @xmath7.@xcite this suggests the many - body extension allows a continuous path that connects sixteen copies of a tsc to a trivial @xmath0-wave superconductor in three dimensions without breaking symmetry or closing the bulk gap .",
    "in fact , the surface majorana modes of _ any _ tsc can be gapped without breaking symmetries .",
    "however , there would generically be a residue topological order , unless @xmath1 is a multiple of 16 , that allows non - trivial anyonic excitations to live on the surface.@xcite as a result , these 3d bulk systems are still topologically distinct from a trivial state .",
    "similar phenomena were also seen in topological insulators@xcite in three dimensions and topological superconductors@xcite in one dimension .",
    "many - body interactions allow the surface dirac mode of a topological insulator to acquire an energy gap without breaking time reversal or charge conservation symmetries .",
    "however a non - trivial surface topological order would be left behind.@xcite this indicates the bulk insulator still carries a non - trivial @xmath8 symmetry protected topology ( spt ) even in the many - body framework . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath6 classification of time reversal symmetric bdi superconductors in one dimension breaks down to @xmath9 in the presence of strong interaction.@xcite    the topological order of a gapped symmetric surface of a topological insulator or superconductor was deduced mainly using vortex condensation or other topological field theory techniques .",
    "they do not specify the microscopic many - body surface gapping interactions that give rise to these exotic surface states .",

    "for instance a gap can be introduced when @xmath1 is even by inter - species single - body backscatterings which preserves symmetry.@xcite thus the surface classification becomes @xmath8 instead of @xmath6 even in the single - body framework . despite the discrepancy , the coupled wire model does bare resemblance to the original problem of topological superconductor surfaces , especially when the number of chiral species @xmath1 is odd .    a major result of this work is to construct many - body gapping potentials that freeze out all low energy degrees of freedom while preserving the non - local time reversal symmetry .",
    "this is achieved by _ fractionalizing _ or _ bipartitioning _ the majorana channels on each wire into a pair of independent sectors without interfering each other .",
