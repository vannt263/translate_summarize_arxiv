    "the design philosophy of the method is explained in the sections 5 and  9 of @xcite ; the technical details of the method are given in the sections 3 , 4 , 6 and the appendix of @xcite .",

    ", @xmath0 refers to the spatial attribute of interest ( such as hydraulic conductivity ) , @xmath1 indicates spatial location .",
    "geostatistical ( or `` structural '' ) parameters are denoted by @xmath2 ; anchors are denoted by @xmath3 . the forward process ( or model ) is denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite classifies on - site data into two types .",
    "type  a data ( @xmath5 ) are direct values of @xmath0 at individual locations .",
    "type  b data ( @xmath6 ) are functions of @xmath0 at multiple locations ( usually the entire domain ) .",
    "type  a data are so defined that they can be used directly in creating conditional fields ( see ( a-3 ) in @xcite , or ( 13 ) in  @xcite ) . as for type  b data , it is important to note that they are functions of the @xmath0 field .",
    "one can not establish correspondence between a type  b data component and the @xmath0 values ( or anchors ) at specific locations .",
    "moreover , type  b data may not be `` spatial '' or possess measurement `` locations '' in the usual sense .",
    "for example , the data may be a time series of tracer concentrations in a transport experiment , measured at one or more locations ; or they may even be a summary of such a time series .",
    "measurement locations , if any , of type  b data are an internal business of the forward model @xmath4 .",
    "they are not a concern to the inversion procedure .",
    "what the inversion procedure expects is a prediction vector @xmath7 , produced by the forward model for any field realization @xmath8 , that can be compared with the observed data vector , @xmath6 .    in the definition of type  a data ,",
    "@xcite calls @xmath9 a `` known function '' ( below formula  ( 1 ) ) .",
    "this is inaccurate . here",
    ", the data must be the spatial attribute @xmath0 itself ( at locations @xmath10 ) and not any transform thereof , because otherwise the use of the data @xmath5 in all subsequent formulas needs to be modified .",
    "however , the data may have been obtained through transformations .",
    "for example , one may arrive at an estimate of the hydraulic conductivity at location @xmath1 using empirical relations that connect conductivity with core - support geophysical properties obtained at that location . in this case , the type  a data @xmath5 are the estimated conductivity , rather than the geophysical property ( which is an empirical function of conductivity ) .",
    "the transformation may well be nonlinear .    at times",
    "@xcite is confused about the concept of type  b data and talks about anchors `` corresponding to '' specific type  b data components ; see , e.g. , paragraphs [ 18 ] , [ 58 ] , [ 82 ] .",
    "a further inaccuracy appears in paragraph  [ 44 ] of @xcite , which states that `` @xmath11 could be used to generate the field or possibly a number of fields @xmath12 '' .",
    "this statement is misleading in that @xmath12 ( value of the forward model ) is _ not _ a `` field '' . the use of the symbol @xmath12 here ( likewise in paragraph  [ 36 ] , and in the `` notation '' with entry `` @xmath12 '' ) is confusing , noticing that it has been declared in paragraph  [ 15 ] that `` the tilde sign over a variable denotes a field of that variable '' .",
    "it is noted that the type  b data ( i.e. @xmath6 ) need not be anything like a `` field '' in the meaning that is familiar to the audience of that article .",
    "for example , the vector @xmath6 may be the combination of a few head measurements and a time series dataset of tracer concentration . besides , @xmath7 , given a @xmath8 , can generate only one @xmath12 , not `` a number of '' @xmath12 .",
    "the reason is that the forward function is deterministic with @xmath8 .",
    "overall , the role of anchors is to connect data ( both types a and b ) with the unknown field @xmath0 . @xcite",
    "mistakenly mentions the role of the anchors as a `` mechanism for connecting between type  a and type  b data '' .",
    "a conceptual justification for the use of anchor is given in @xcite .",
    "the idea is that ( after appropriate choice of anchors and adequate inference of their posterior distribution ) anchors `` capture '' the information contained in data @xmath6 about the field @xmath0 , so that simulation of @xmath0 conditional on @xmath13 can be substituted by simulation conditional on the anchors .",

    "the importance of the numerical estimation of this likelihood is also shown in @xcite at multiple places , such as in paragraphs [ 23 ] , [ 33][37 ] , [ 73 ] , [ 121 ] .",
    "however , @xcite does not provide technical details of this component .",

    "3.1.1 ) and @xcite ) .",
    "this unfortunate omission creates an awkward situation : the article by @xcite presents a methodology without presenting how it works .",
    "the numerical procedure of likelihood estimation adopted in @xcite and @xcite is the @xmath17-th nearest neighbor estimator .",
    "let @xmath18 , ... , @xmath19 be an i.i.d . sample from the @xmath20-variate ( continuous ) distribution of @xmath21 , whose density function is denoted by @xmath22 . the density at @xmath6 ( i.e. the observed type  b data vector ) is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the identity function , @xmath25 is the euclidean distance , and @xmath26 is the volume of the unit hypersphere of dimension @xmath20 .",

    "@xcite suggests @xmath32 as an empirical choice of @xmath17 .",
    "there is a large statistical literature on multivariate density estimation .",
    "( `` likelihood '' is a probability density . )",
    "it is not difficult to adjust specifics of this procedure , but the spirit of nonparametric , numerical estimation remains .",
    "@xcite points out , using the observations in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* list after paragraph 4 in sec .",
    "6.2 ) , that only the likelihood at the observed @xmath13 value needs to be estimated ; moreover , the estimation may use a large sample size @xmath33 as long as computational resources permit .",
    "@xcite also cites the relatively low dimensionality of @xmath34 as a factor that contributes to the method s computational efficiency compared with `` full - grid inversion ''",
    ". however , anchored inversion and `` full - grid inversion '' use their respective parameter vectors , @xmath34 versus @xmath8 , in different ways ; their relative computational cost is unrelated to the comparison of their parameter dimensionalities .    as mentioned above , it is a signature of the method that no parametric form is assumed for the likelihood function @xmath16 ; rather , the likelihood is estimated nonparametrically .",
    "this decision is necessitated by the largely intractable model errors ; see @xcite for an explanation .",
    "@xcite states that the likelihood @xmath16 may be taken to be either parametric or nonparametric .",
    "the application paper by @xcite actually makes an attempt to assume gaussian likelihoods .",
    "however , it is important to note that the distribution of the forward process output is dependent on ( 1 ) the nature of the particular process ; ( 2 ) the field parameter ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) . the distribution ( both shape and parameters ) may change with any change of either of these two factors . besides , it is a misconception that parametric methods are more efficient than nonparametric ones",
    "this is the case only when the parametric form is correct .    on the other hand , if one does assume a parametric form for the likelihood function ( with known parameter values , whether or not the assumptions are reasonable ) , then the problem falls squarely in the realm of markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) and related sampling schemes . in that case",
    "there is no advantage in using the newly proposed method .",
    "the anchored inversion methodology is open and flexible with respect to the geostatistical formulation and the prior specification for the model parameters , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . nevertheless , these technical details _ are _ important because ( 1 ) one has to make choices for these technicalities in order to get the procedure running , and ( 2 ) the details affect the performance . of these technicalities ,",
    "the specification of prior is the most important .",
    "@xcite and @xcite adopt a geostatistical formulation that includes parameters for trend , variance , scale , nugget , and the matrn correlation .",
    "in addition , box - cox transform is performed to deal with possible nonnormality of @xmath0 .",
    "the prior for the geostatistical parameters @xmath2 is given by formula  ( a-2 ) in @xcite .",
    "this prior has been proposed by @xcite to work with the box - cox transform .",
    "this prior is re - used by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* formula  ( 11 ) ) . however , @xcite choses to drop the box - cox transform . as a result ,",
    "the reason for using this particular form of prior is lost .",
    "the same problem exists in @xcite .",
    "the matrn covariance ( or correlation ) model is an important tool in spatial statistics .",
    "@xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix ) include brief introductions to this tool .",
    "an especially valuable asset of the matrn model is its parameter @xmath35 , which concerns the smoothness of the random field bearing this spatial association modeled by the matrn covariance function .",
    "as @xmath35 increases , the field becomes smoother in a certain statistical sense .",
    "one can choose a particular value of @xmath35 based on this interpretation , as is done in @xcite . examining",
    "the full range of @xmath35 is usually not a good idea : it is both unnecessary and infeasible .",
    "it is infeasible because it necessitates numerical evaluation of the bessel function ( admittedly this is not a huge obstacle in this age ) .",
    "it is unnecessary because one or a few reasonable smoothness levels ( @xmath35 values ) usually provide adequate characterization of ones random field under consideration ( as far as smoothness is concerned ) . a deeper reason for skipping a `` full - range '' examination lies in the intimate interactions between the smoothness , scale ( or range ) , and variance parameters ; the interactions cause difficulties in identifiability .",
    "what is debatable in the use of the matrn model in @xcite and @xcite is that both articles advocate the notion that the full range of @xmath36 be explored for @xmath35 , and this act be interpreted as `` model averaging '' .",
    "the authors emphasize the notion that different values of @xmath35 can be viewed as different covariance models .",
    "if one limits @xmath35 to several discrete values , then the posterior of @xmath37 places certain weight on each of these values , hence the estimated correlation structure can be viewed as a weighted average of these special cases . if one picks a single estimate , it amounts to a selection from these several special cases .",
    "this model averaging or selection is accomplished via parameter estimation ( of @xmath35 ) , as opposed to some external measure that distinguishes the performance of those special cases considered .",
    "such model averaging interpretation is less useful when @xmath35 is treated as a continuous variable , because the continuously changing @xmath35 represents a coherent concept of `` smoothness '' , and thinking of each arbitrary value of @xmath35 as a special `` model '' in its own right is not beneficial .",
    "another situation where the `` model averaging / selection '' perspective is less useful is when the correlation function is not the sole focus of the discussion but rather constitutes part of a large parameter vector .    in the effort to introduce the matrn model and promote the `` model selection / averaging '' interpretation",
    ", @xcite makes some statements that harm the coherency of the description of the inversion method . in paragraph  [ 47 ] , for example , the article confuses the `` forward model '' with the `` covariance model '' .",
    "it refers to any particular value of the parameter vector @xmath34 as a particular ( forward ) `` model '' , and talks about the `` probability '' of each such model , while @xmath34 in mad is the model parameter and as such certainly can take different values according to its posterior distribution . in paragraph",
    "[ 48 ] it is claimed that `` equation  ( 3 ) ... could be written for each of the @xmath38 combinations of @xmath39 , @xmath40 instead of a single @xmath2 , @xmath3 combination '' .",
    "however , equation  ( 3 ) is about _ parameters _ @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which can take various values ( or `` combinations '' ) in the first place .",
    "the equation is never about `` a single @xmath2 , @xmath3 combination '' . for a single @xmath2 , @xmath3 combination , one needs only to plug the specific values into the equation .",
    "since anchors are parameters defined by the user , the user needs to make decisions on how many anchors to use and where to place them .    @xcite outlines factors that should be considered while determining the placement of anchors .",
    "further details are given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and paragraphs  67 of sec .",
    "9 ) . to summarize the main points , ( 1 )",
    "anchors should be placed where they are sensitive to the forward process @xmath4 so that information in the forward data @xmath13 is efficiently `` transferred '' to anchors ; ( 2 ) anchors should be placed where one s future prediction tasks need them most .",
    "the second point is referred to as `` objective oriented inversion '' in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* of sec .",
    "9 ) . of these two considerations ,",
    "the second is more important because one s goal is never to `` re - play '' the data - generating forward process @xmath4 , whose outcome is already known .",
    "when future prediction task is not yet known , one should aim for the anchors to achieve overall `` good '' and balanced representation of the entire field @xmath0 , with attention to regions possessing critical features .",
    "these considerations also appear in @xcite ( in paragraphs [ 58 ] and  [ 62 ] the authors re - term the second criterion `` targeted anchor placement '' ) , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "regarding the `` right '' or `` optimum '' number of anchors to use , zhang [ personal correspondence to murakami and rubin , 4 october 2008 ] suggests , `` the number of anchors should be determined based on a measure compromising the ` sharpness ' of conditioning and the identifiability of the parameters ( anchor values ) . with a small number of anchors , the conditioning ca nt be very sharp , because the variability in the field conditioning [ conditional ] on the anchors is still large . ''",
    "zhang [ personal correspondence to rubin , 21 december 2008 ] further clarifies , `` basically in the area of interest , we can distribute inverted anchors according to some recommended sampling design . then we can increase the number of inverted anchors and get prediction results .",
    "the right number of anchors is achieved when the prediction stabilizes . ''",
    "these suggestions are rephrased in @xcite and @xcite without implementation .",
    "implementation of this idea is likely to be nontrivial .",
    "@xcite mentions the possibility of incorporating multiple type  b datasets in a sequential manner , and outlines the conditions under which this is or is not suitable .",
    "this idea also appears in @xcite .",
    "the formula  ( 16 ) in @xcite is correct up to the second line .",
    "the third `` @xmath41 '' does not hold because @xmath42 one would have equality here if the two datasets @xmath43 and @xmath44 are independent , which usually requires that the spatial domains in which their respective forward processes take place are disjoint ( and far apart ) . in practical applications , however , this is unlikely to be the case .",
    "note , in particular , that the dependence between @xmath43 and @xmath44 is not diminished even if the two forward processes are of incomparable physical natures , for example one is a pumping test and the other is a tracer test .",
    "the dependence is due to the common @xmath0 field that underlies both tests .",
    "another situation in which one would have equality in the relation above is that @xmath43 is implied by @xmath45 , that is , any field @xmath8 conditional on any particular @xmath46 would reproduce ( i.e. predict by the forward model ) @xmath43 exactly .",
    "this can not happen in the current context .",
    "formula  ( 17 ) in @xcite assumes @xmath43 and @xmath44 are independent . as mentioned above",
    ", this assumption could be valid when the respective forward processes for @xmath43 and @xmath44 take place in disjoint and far - apart regions .",
    "the further condition of `` far - apart '' is needed because of spatial correlation in the @xmath0 field .",
    "when these conditions are met , @xmath43 and @xmath44 would be disjointly useful for their respective spatial regions .",
    "in such situations , it may not be appropriate to assume the different regions share the same value of the structural parameter @xmath2 .",
    "consequently , one may as well need to divide the entire spatial domain into isolated sub - regions and study them separately .",
    "this is not a typical scenario of experimental or observational studies .",
    "@xcite makes similar attempts and has similar problems .",
    "more discussion on this issue can be found in @xcite .",
    "very early development of the anchor idea benefited from the popular `` pilot point '' method ( ppm ) @xcite .",
    "this is shown in that @xcite used the name `` pilot point '' provisionally in describing the new concept , before the name `` anchor '' occurred to the author .",
    "( the name `` pivot point '' occurred before `` anchor '' but was abandoned ; see @xcite . ) some superficial similarities notwithstanding , the two methods are very different ; see @xcite for some discussion .    as is explained in @xcite , an important difference between ppm and anchored inversion",
    "is that the former produces an ensemble of pilot point values that are not a random sample of a clearly - defined target distribution , whereas the latter infers the distribution of anchor values ( along with other parameters ) following statistical rules .",
    "these observations are borrowed from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and zhang [ personal correspondence to rubin , 8 may 2008 ] .",
    "( see , e.g. , paragraph  [ 104 ] of @xcite and the 2nd paragraph of sec .  1 in @xcite .",
    ")    another issue with ppm is that it requires the geostatistical parameters ( @xmath2 ) to be pre - specified , and has no provisions for systematically updating these parameters in light of the type  b data @xmath13 ( @xcite and @xcite ) .    in ppm ,",
    "the same optimization procedure is applied to each ( vector ) value ever tried for the pilot points , and each value for the pilot points eventually leads to one realization of the field @xmath0 . as a result ,",
    "the computational cost is proportional to the number of field realizations created in the resultant ensemble . in anchored inversion , inference of the parameter ( both @xmath2 and @xmath3 )",
    "distribution requires a large number of field realizations .",
    "once this inference is done , creating field realizations ( to be used for characterization , analysis , prediction , etc . )",

    "when the field has a constant mean , the design matrix would be a column matrix of 1 s and @xmath54 would be of length 1 .",
    "this is not like what is stated in paragraph  [ 69 ] , `` all the terms in @xmath55 are equal to @xmath57 '' .",
    "the @xmath55 in formula  ( 12 ) is meant to be the mean of @xmath0 at locations @xmath10 .",
    "this mean is a function of the structural parameters ( in particular , the trend parameters ) as well as the location vector @xmath10 .",
    "it is a vector of length @xmath58 , and is not the model parameter @xmath55 in the previous paragraphs .",
    "( the length of the model parameter vector is independent of @xmath58 . ) however , its functional relation with the structural parameters is lost in  ( 12 ) .",
    "a similar confusion occurs in formula  ( 14 ) .",

    "the formulas  ( 11)(15 ) are taken from the appendix of @xcite , with necessary adjustment because the box - cox transform used in @xcite is dropped in @xcite .",

    "it is not possible to give correct versions of ( 12 ) , ( 14 ) , and ( 15 ) without introducing symbols that are not defined in sections 6.1.1 and  6.1.2 , because the concept of `` design matrix '' and the symbol @xmath55 defined in paragraph  [ 68 ] are problematic .",
    "the right - hand side of formula  ( 18 ) equals @xmath68 , which is the likelihood .",
    "optimizing the likelihood would lead to ml rather than map estimates .",
    "formula  ( 18 ) would be correct if the prior @xmath69 were flat .",
    "however , that would make the formulation non - bayesian , and hence unrelated to map . in paragraph  [ 90 ] , @xmath70 is referred to as `` prior '' .",

    "[ 91 ] appears the relation @xmath71 .",
    "however , @xmath8 does not appear in  ( 18 ) , hence @xmath52 is undefined .",
    "the method of anchored inversion has a number of notable features including ( 1 ) the anchor concept , which on the one hand creates a bridge between the spatial attribute field @xmath0 and the forward data @xmath6 , and on the other hand separates the dimensionality of the model parameter ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) from that of the numerical grid ; and ( 2 ) the recognition that the likelihood function is unknown and needs to be estimated nonparameterically .",
    "the method is general and in a sense modular , although these desirable features are not unique to this method .",
    "the anchor parameterization may be used in a bayesian way ( e.g. deriving posterior distributions ) or a non - bayesian way ( e.g. obtaining maximum likelihood estimates ) .",
