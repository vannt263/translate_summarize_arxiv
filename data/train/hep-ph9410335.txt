    "measurements of the spin - dependent structure function of the nucleon , @xmath0 , continue to generate enormous interest .",
    "not only has the precision with which the ellis - jaffe sum - rule is known improved , but with the addition of neutron data from slac and smc the bjorken sum - rule has also been tested @xcite .",
    "our aim is to provide a necessarily brief review of the situation with respect to the sum - rules .",
    "( for those interested in more detail we suggest some recent reviews @xcite . )",
    "we then argue that the emphasis in future should be much more on the shape and momentum dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "there has recently been substantial progress in understanding the flavour and spin dependence of the parton distributions in terms of the quark models familiar from low energy spectroscopy and we briefly recall the main ideas .    as nature",
    "has not seen fit to give us a free neutron target , nuclear and particle physicists must work together in order to extract @xmath1 .",
    "some very recent progress in the treatment of deep - inelastic scattering from the deuteron is reviewed .",
    "finally we highlight some important open questions which need experimental or theoretical attention .",
    "the spin structure function @xmath0 is determined by the difference in the cross section for a polarised , virtual photon to be absorbed by a nucleon with its spin anti - parallel and parallel to that of the photon g_1_-_. as the photon is absorbed by a spin-@xmath2 quark , in the former case the absorbing parton must have spin parallel to that of the nucleon @xmath3 while in the latter case it must be anti - parallel @xmath4 .",
    "it is usual to define the net spin ( helicity ) carried by quarks ( and anti - quarks ) of a given flavour as u(x , q^2)=u^-u^+^- ^ , etc .",
    "( quarks and anti - quarks have the same charge squared and contribute with the same sign . ) thus one easily finds g_1p(x , q^2)=\\{u(x , q^2)+ d(x , q^2)+s(x , q^2)+  } , and if we define the isovector , octet and singlet flavour combinations in the usual way q_3(x , q^2)&=&u(x , q^2)-d(x , q^2 ) , + q_8(x , q^2)&=&u(x , q^2)+d(x , q^2)-2s(x , q^2 ) , + q_0(x , q^2)&=&u(x , q^2)+d(x , q^2)+s(x , q^2 ) , we find g_1p(n)(x , q^2)=q_3+q_8 + q_0 .",
    "using current algebra the integrals of @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be related to the axial charges in neutron and hyperon @xmath7-decay q_3&=&_0 ^ 1dx q_3(x , q^2)=1.2570.003 , + q_8&=&_0 ^ 1dx q_8(x , q^2)0.590.02 , where the question mark indicates some residual uncertainty over the use of flavour su(3 ) symmetry . from the definition in equ.(4 ) it is clear that the integral of @xmath8 is just the fraction of the spin of the nucleon carried by its quarks , @xmath9 : = _ 0 ^ 1dx q_0(x , q^2 ) .",
    "within qcd there are also perturbative corrections which vanish logarithmically as @xmath10 , so that the integrals of the proton and neutron spin structure functions s^p(n)(q^2)=_0 ^ 1 dx g_1p(n)(x , q^2 ) , become @xcite : s^p(n)(q^2)&=&(1 - - 3.58()^2- 20.2()^3 ) ( q_3 + ) + & + & ( 1 - - 1.1()^2 ) , ( for three flavours ) .",
    "the bjorken sum - rule involves the difference of the integrals for the proton and neutron s^bj&=&s^p - s^n=(1 - - 3.6()^2)q_3 , + & = & 0.185atq^2=10 gev^2 .",
    "this particular sum - rule is extremely important as a failure would represent a failure of current algebra for the quarks @xcite .",
    "the ellis - jaffe sum - rule @xcite requires a dynamical assumption , namely that the polarisation of the strange sea of the nucleon vanishes , @xmath11 . with this reasonable assumption",
    "we find @xmath12 and hence s_ej^p&=&0.1710.004,(0.1610.004 ) , + s_ej^n&&=-0.0140.004,(-0.0100.004 ) at @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the latest experimental information was presented in detail at this meeting @xcite and therefore we simply state the results .",
    "the original emc measurement @xcite gave @xmath15 at @xmath16 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath9 of only @xmath17 ( 12% to 0(@xmath18 ) ) .",
    "it is clearly compatible with _",
    "none of the nucleon spin being carried by its quarks _ , which was the origin of the term ` spin crisis ' .",
    "this led to great interest in alternatives to the quark model , such as the skyrme model @xcite .",
    "indeed the question has been asked whether the quark model would have been taken seriously if this had been known in the 60 s  rather than the famous prediction @xmath19 . on the other hand",
    ", a cautious observer might add that the result is only 2 - 3 standard deviations from the ellis - jaffe prediction .    at this meeting",
    "new values were presented from the smc and slac groups .",
    "for the proton , smc finds @xmath20 at 10 @xmath21 , while a combined analysis with earlier proton data yields @xmath22 @xcite . the preliminary result reported from slac e143 was @xmath23 at @xmath14 , while for the deuteron and neutron they found @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively @xcite .",
    "these values are summarised in table 1 .    in all cases the experimental values are significantly below the theoretical expectation and it is common to conclude that the two experiments agree and that @xmath9 is of order one third . on the other hand ,",
    "we know that the integral of @xmath26 changes sign at @xmath27 ( to give the dhg sum - rule @xcite ) , so that there is a dramatic variation in the sum - rule , due to non - perturbative effects , between @xmath27 and 3 @xmath21 .",
    "vector meson dominance has been used by ioffe and collaborators to provide a physically reasonable , smooth interpolation between the low-@xmath28 and asymptotic regimes @xcite . at 3 and 10",
    "gev@xmath29 this approach suggests a correction to the measured sum - rule for the proton ( neutron ) of 29% ( 20% ) and 8% ( 6% ) respectively . while there is , as yet , no consensus on these values @xcite we find the sign and magnitude very reasonable .",
    "applying them to the results quoted above , we find the values for the integrals and corresponding spin fractions shown in table 1 .",
    ".integrals of @xmath30 and @xmath1 with and without a correction for the non - perturbative dependence on @xmath28 following refs.@xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     after correction for non - perturbative effects the experiments are consistent with an average value of the spin carried by the quarks of @xmath31  somewhat higher than the value of one third found without the correction .",
    "we believe that @xmath31 is probably the best estimate at the present time .",
    "it is roughly one standard deviation below the value of 60% implicit in the ellis - jaffe sum - rule .",
    "notice that this expectation is not 100% for the same reason that @xmath32 is not 5/3  the lower component of the quark wave function is p - wave and the quark spin most often points opposite to the total angular momentum .",
    "this is a simple , well understood , relativistic correction .",
    "clearly the data is no longer consistent with @xmath33 and a 1 @xmath34 deviation is not a crisis .",
    "nevertheless the physics is far from clear and in many ways the serious study of the problem is just beginning !",
    "much of the theoretical interest in the ellis - jaffe sum - rule , and most of the papers , have been concerned with the role of the u(1 ) axial anomaly in the flavour singlet piece , @xmath35 . following the work of efremov and teryaev and altarelli and ross @xcite ( etar ) ",
    "see also ref.@xcite  it is common to correct the naive parton model ( npm ) value for @xmath36 and @xmath37 by u(x , q^2 ) & & u(x , q^2)|_npm-(x , q^2 ) , + d(x , q^2 ) & & d(x , q^2)|_npm-(x , q^2 ) , + s(x , q^2 ) & & s(x , q^2)|_npm-(x , q^2 ) , where ( x , q^2)= _",
    "x^1c^g(,q^2 ) g(y , q^2 ) dy , and _ 0 ^ 1(x , q^2)=g . here",
    "@xmath38 is the fraction of the proton spin carried by gluons . in this picture _",
    "npm-3 , [ sigeqn ] and if ( following ellis and jaffe ) one sets @xmath37 to zero in the npm we find @xmath39 through the anomaly .",
    "clearly the residual discrepancy in the ellis - jaffe sum - rule could be fixed with @xmath40 , which corresponds to @xmath41 at @xmath13 , or @xmath42 at a quark model scale ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the latter agrees rather too well with the simple estimate of @xmath38 associated with one - gluon - exchange by brodsky and schmidt @xcite .",
    "certainly this result is far more reasonable that the values of @xmath44 required when @xmath9 was compatible with zero !",
    "we would like to emphasise that one wins in two ways through radiation of polarised gluons .",
    "firstly , as we have just seen , the point - like coupling to the quarks in the gluon reduces @xmath9 . secondly , however , these gluons carry spin away from the quarks . this correction was shown to amount to 5 - 10% in @xmath9 @xcite but as it involves non - perturbative qcd has generally been overlooked by the same groups who use equ.([sigeqn ] ) .    as usual with the anomaly",
    "there has been considerable controversy .",
    "the separation between @xmath45 and @xmath46 is not gauge invariant at the operator level .",
    "indeed this lies at the heart of the anomaly @xcite , which arises precisely because one can not satisfy chiral symmetry gauge invariance . in the operator product expansion ( ope )",
    "there is no operator corresponding to @xmath38 . from this a number of authors , notably bodwin and qiu , have argued that the first moment of @xmath47 should vanish @xcite .",
    "there has also been much debate over the infrared sensitivity of the separation of @xmath48 and @xmath46 [ 4,5,24 - 27 ] . in the end , for the gauge usually used in the parton model ( @xmath49 ) ,",
    "the correction is probably reliable .",
    "however this raises another problem , the shape of @xmath50 .",
    "as emphasised in ref.@xcite , the gluonic correction effects @xmath50 only at very small x ( well below 0.1 ) .",
    "this is well below the region where the calculations of @xmath51 deviate from the data .",
    "the study of the shape of @xmath50 , and particularly the mechanism for transfering strength from intermediate x to low x , is therefore a clear priority for future work . with this in mind , in the next section we present some simple ideas which help us to understand the shape of @xmath30 and @xmath1 . before closing",
    "we should mention that not everyone is convinced that the effects of the anomaly are confined to small x , and any hint of ozi violation in the purely valence region would be most interesting indeed @xcite .",
    "formally the twist - two parton distributions can be written @xcite q^(2)(x,^2)=_ndp |np|_+(0)|n|^2(m(1-x)-p_n^+ ) , with p_n^+=+p_z>0 .",
    "here @xmath52 are a complete set of states of momentum @xmath53 and rest mass @xmath54 and equ.(16 ) guarantees that the distribution vanishes for @xmath55 .",
    "this formal expression has been used extensively to calculate parton distribution for the mit bag model by the adelaide group @xcite .",
    "an important conclusion of that work is that the dominant contribution ( at the quark model scale @xmath56  c.f .",
    "refs.@xcite ) arises from a two - quark intermediate state , n=2 . for a simple nucleon wave function , with three quarks in the 1s - state",
    ", the matrix element @xmath57 should peak near @xmath58 .",
    "hence the maximum value of @xmath59 should occur at @xmath60  from the @xmath46-function  and the dominant contribution at large x will be the one associated with the lowest value of @xmath61 .",
    "this was first realised by close and thomas who stressed the importance for both the flavour and the spin dependence of the parton distribution @xcite .",
    "for example , using the standard su(6 ) wave function for the proton one easily finds that a valence d - quark has only an s=1 pair as spectator , while a u - quark has a 50 - 50 chance of s=0 or s=1 .",
    "whatever mechanism is used to generate the n-@xmath62 mass splitting ",
    "e.g. gluon exchange , pion exchange or instantons  gives typically @xmath63 .",
    "hence the u - quarks should dominate at large x ",
    "i.e. one expects @xmath64 as @xmath65 , as found experimentally .    for a polarised proton ( neutron ) only the valence @xmath66",
    "is found with an @xmath67 pair and hence @xmath66 should dominate at large x. from equ.(2 ) we see that @xmath30 must be positive , as must @xmath1 , at intermediate and large x. note that all this follows from the _ same physics _ required in low energy spectroscopy ( and a simple su(6 ) wave function ) .",
    "it works because deep inelastic scattering involves a light - cone correlation function and the energy of the quark is as important as its momentum .",
    "of course , a full calculation should also include the configuration mixing in the wave function , but this is not the _ leading _ effect .",
    "in passing we note that this same approach to calculating parton distributions leads to an unexpectedly large violation of charge symmetry for the minority valence quarks ( @xmath68 ) @xcite .",
    "it is somewhat disappointing that the focus on sum - rules means that we still do not know whether @xmath1 does become positive at intermediate and large x. although the approach just described is unambiguous , the inclusion of the correction associated with the axial anomaly could change this and it is very important to know .",
    "figure 1 illustrates this by showing the prediction for @xmath1 from the bag model ( with a bag radius r=0.6 fm ) @xcite , with and without a phenomenological singlet term added to fit the proton data @xcite .",
    "the dashed curve was then a prediction for @xmath1 published before the data .",
    "recall that the earlier phenomenology of carlitz - kaur @xcite and schfer @xcite used counting rules to parameterize the effect of admixing polarised gluons in the proton wave function .",
    "as we have already noted , this complements the work of etar - see also refs.@xcite .",
    "it would be desirable to have a full microscopic calculation , including this effect and the close - thomas mechanism , within a model which is consistent with low energy hadronic properties .    as a final consideration in calculating the shape of the spin distributions we must also mention the role of chiral symmetry .",
    "chiral quark models , like the cloudy bag@xcite , have proven very successful in dealing with low - energy hadronic properties .",
    "the charge form - factor of the neutron , @xmath69 , is a famous example , where the positive core and negative tail of the corresponding charge density is a first - order effect in the perturbative dressing of the nucleon bag  through the process @xmath70@xcite .",
    "( indeed , within the cloudy bag model an accurate measurement of the zero in @xmath71 would determine the radius within which the quarks are confined . ) for the spin problem the role of the pion cloud is more complicated .",
    "for the proton the dominant , pionic correction is @xmath72 , while for the neutron it is @xmath73 . combined with the reduction in the bare nucleon contribution through the wave function renormalisation constant , z , both of these effects tend to reduce the positive values of @xmath26 at large x @xcite .",
    "the only complete investigation of pionic corrections has been carried out for the ellis - jaffe sum - rule @xcite , where it gives a small reduction ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "this reduction would be larger were it not for an @xmath75 interference term .",
    "the x - dependence of the latter is a completely new term which has never been calculated .",
    "in order to study quark - parton distributions in the neutron , one must deal with either the deuteron or some heavier nucleus . in the spin - dependent case",
    "the two nuclei studied are polarised deuterium ( @xmath76 ) and @xmath77 .",
    "the simplest theoretical approach for deuterium is to approximate it as a free neutron and proton with polarisation ( @xmath78 ) - where @xmath79 is the deuteron d - state probability . at the next level of sophistication",
    "we have a convolution of the free nucleon structure function with the light - cone momentum distribution of nucleons in the nucleus @xcite : g_1d(x , q^2)=_n = n , p_x f_n / d(y ) g_1n(,q^2 ) .",
    "strangely the situation for polarised structure functions is better than for the unpolarised case , where data is still often analysed @xcite using  smearing functions \" pre - dating @xcite the original emc effect @xcite - and therefore ignoring binding corrections @xcite ( see however ref.@xcite ) .",
    "tokarev found that for the polarised case the convolution gave a result very close to that obtained with a constant depolarisation for @xmath80 @xcite - see also kaptari and umnikov @xcite .",
    "reassuring as these results may be , the only way to test the reliability of the convolution is to do better . even within the impulse approximation ( ia )",
    "one may ask , for example , whether off - shell effects might spoil the convolution form . for the unpolarised case this was studied by melnitchouk , thomas and schreiber @xcite who found that even in the bjorken limit the dirac structure of the nucleon involves not one but three functions ^=p_t^(_0(p , q)+_1(p , q)+_2(p , q ) ) . thus , whereas the free structure function involves one linear combination f_2^freem_0+m^2_1+pq_2 , obtained by tracing @xmath81 with @xmath82 , in a nucleus , where the nucleon propagator is @xmath83 , we find f_2^boundb_0+ap_1+aq_2 , which is proportional to @xmath84 .    to study the practical significance of this breakdown , one needs a covariant description of the @xmath85 vertex as well as the off - shell nucleon structure function . for the former we can use the vertex of refs.@xcite . for the latter melnitchouk , piller and",
    "thomas @xcite have employed a covariant version of the physics presented in sect .",
    "3 . that is ,",
    "they constructed a set of phenomenological functions for the @xmath86 ( di - quark ) vertices which were fitted to free nucleon data .",
    "as before , the di - quark states were either scalar or pseudovector .",
    "after considerable dirac algebra one finds that the anti - symmetric nucleon tensor , surviving for massless quarks , in the bjorken limit is _ a - s^=i ^ \\{q_p__5 g_(p ) + q_p_g_(q ) + q___5 g _ ( ) } , so that g_1n^freepq . for the deuteron case one must trace @xmath87 with a term involving @xmath88 , with the result : g_1d(x)_n = n , pdy dp^2\\{aq + pq ap g_(p)^n}. the last term is not present in the free case , so that in principle the convolution must fail .",
    "figure 2 shows the numerical results obtained by melnitchouk et al .",
    "@xcite for the ratio of the deuteron to isoscalar nucleon spin structure function . the full calculation ( solid line ) is very close to the simple approximation of a constant depolarisation ( dotted line ) for @xmath89 .",
    "this agrees with the result found in earlier work using the convolution approach .",
    "indeed we see from the dashed curve that an appropriate convolution is very close to the full off - shell calculation for all @xmath90 . in practice the additional term in equ.(24 )",
    "is of order @xmath91 and negligible for the deuteron . in the end",
    "the major uncertainty in extracting the neutron structure function is not the failure of convolution or even the assumption of a constant depolarisation , but the old chestnut of the lack of knowledge of the deuteron d - state probability .",
    "this ranges between 4 and 7% , with modern , non - local potentials preferring @xmath92 . at @xmath93 , for example , a variation of 1% in @xmath79 corresponds to an error of roughly 10% in @xmath1 @xcite . at present",
    "this is smaller than the experimental errors but will soon be significant .    to conclude this discussion , we must note that the ia is by no means secure . for heavier nuclei",
    "it has been shown to significantly overestimate the effect of binding because deep - inelastic scattering determines the energy and momentum distribution of quarks nucleons @xcite ! this has not yet been investigated for the deuteron where the ia may not be so bad .",
    "theoretical studies of @xmath94 have so far not gone beyond an essentially non - relativistic convolution because of the absence of a relativistic model of the necessary vertices . in view of the deuteron",
    "results it would be surprising if there were a major problem , nevertheless it should be checked .",
    "finally we note that the actual structure of the bound nucleon may change .",
    "for the unpolarised case this has been shown to be a very small effect @xcite within the guichon model @xcite .",
    "however , spin structure functions involve the lower components of the quark wave functions more directly and these change most in nuclear matter .",
    "it has been suggested in ref.@xcite , for example , that @xmath95 differs from the free value by about 5% .",
    "it is therefore an urgent matter to check this issue .",
    "as we have seen there has been remarkable progress in the experimental determination of the spin structure functions of the proton and the neutron .",
    "the bjorken sum - rule has been verified at the 10% level ( at 1@xmath34 ) . in view of its significance",
    "it is very important to continue to reduce this error . with respect to the ellis - jaffe sum - rule",
    "it is now clear that there is no longer a ` crisis ' in the sense that none of the nucleon spin is carried by quarks . with a reasonable estimate of the non - perturbative corrections",
    "we find that all experiments are consistent with @xmath96 compared with the expectation of about 60% of the nucleon spin carried by quarks .",
    "however , _ the end of the crisis is the beginning of some very challenging and fascinating physics_. it is now known that the regge behaviour usually assumed in extrapolating to @xmath97 is not appropriate to the flavour singlet component , which may have logarithmic corrections @xcite .",
    "bass and landshoff suggest these might contribute as much as 25% to @xmath9 @xcite , while close and roberts have suggested recently that the error might be even larger@xcite .",
    "there is as yet no consensus on the size of the higher twist corrections .",
    "both of these issues need thorough experimental study of the @xmath98 and @xmath28 variation of the structure functions as well as more theoretical work .",
    "the shape of the @xmath98 distribution of the neutron is still not well known . in view of the beautiful link between low energy hadron structure and parton distributions outlined in sect .",
    "3 it is very important to determine whether @xmath1 does become positive at intermediate and large @xmath98 . related to this is the question of whether strength is shifted from intermediate @xmath98 to the region below 0.1 , and if so what mechanism is responsible .",
    "the role of the axial anomaly is particularly fundamental , and can in principle be determined by comparing @xmath26 with a c - odd structure function like @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "the use of light nuclear targets to extract information on the neutron seems to be well under control .",
    "we have seen that an appropriate convolution formula is very accurate when compared with a full off - shell calculation . the major problem for the deuteron is the uncertainty over its d - state probability .",
    "this may also be a problem for @xmath77 .",
    "shadowing and meson exchange corrections have been investigated in detail for the unpolarised case @xcite but much more must be done for the polarised case @xcite .",
    "there is so far no estimate of the effect on @xmath26 of a possible change in the internal nucleon structure .    throughout our discussion",
    "we have followed the conventional approach of ignoring charm quarks ( i.e. @xmath100 is set to zero ) .",
    "since most data points are actually above charm threshold , this needs more investigation @xcite .",
    "a related problem concerns the suggestion of using neutrino proton elastic scattering to measure @xmath37 . as the neutral current couples to a non - singlet axial current",
    "it is less than obvious that such an experiment can yield information on a singlet quality like @xmath46 .",
    "thus one may learn about @xmath101 rather than @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the breadth of open questions in this field is enormous - ranging from issues of quark structure in nuclei , to pomerons and the axial anomaly .",
    "it is truly an appropriate meeting ground for nuclear and particle physicists and an appropriate beginning to the first joint spin conference .",
    "i am grateful to the organising committee(s ) for the invitation to present these thoughts .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank my colleagues , particularly s. bass , w. melnitchouk , g. piller , a. schreiber and f. steffens , who have taught me a great deal about the matters presented here .",
