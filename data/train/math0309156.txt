    "the two forces at its endpoints are equal in size and opposite in direction . with the polygons sharing parallel edges",
    "they can then be pieced together , edge to edge , as the faces of the dual graph , figure  [ figurewheel4recippseudoeplode ] .    ]    for a framework on a planar graph with only internal forces ( tension and compression in equilibrium ) , the creation of a complete reciprocal diagram ",
    "a second framework on the planar dual graph from all these patches  is equivalent to verifying the equilibrium of these forces .",
    "each set of equilibrium forces in a planar framework generates a reciprocal framework , unique up to translation , and each reciprocal prescribes a set of forces in equilibrium .",
    "reciprocal figures were first developed in the 19th century as a graphical technique to calculate when external static forces on a plane framework reach an equilibrium at all the vertices with resolving tensions and compressions in the members  @xcite , and were the basis for _ graphical statics _ in civil engineering in the last half of the 19th century .",
    "this technique has been rediscovered and applied by a number of authors , and was used to check the eiffel tower prior to construction @xcite .    classically , there are two graphic forms for the reciprocal . in the engineering work adapted to graphical techniques at the drafting table and presented by the mathematician and engineer cremona @xcite ,",
    "the edges of the reciprocal are drawn parallel to the edges of the original .",
    "we will use this ` cremona ' form of the reciprocal in most of our proofs .    in the original work of maxwell",
    "the edges of the reciprocal are drawn perpendicular to the edges of the original framework .",
    "this form is adapted to viewing the framework on a planar graph as a projection of a spatial polyhedron and the reciprocal as a drawing of the dual polyhedron .",
    "the surprise is that this image captures an exact correspondence : a framework with a planar graph has a self - stress if and only if it is the exact projection of a spatial , possibly self - intersecting , spherical polyhedron , figure  [ figurewheel4lpseudolift ] ,    .[figurewheel4lpseudolift ] ]    with non - zero dihedral angles directly corresponding to the non - zero forces in the self - stress of the projection @xcite .",
    "moreover , the reciprocal diagram is the projection of a very specific spatial polar of the original projected polyhedron",
    ". we will return to an application of this correspondence with spatial polyhedra in section  [ sectlift ] .",
    "this spatial polarity also reinforces the reciprocal relationship for plane frameworks , since either framework can be viewed as the original and the other viewed as its reciprocal .",
    "it is not difficult to check that given one presentation of the reciprocal , we can simply turn it @xmath3 to create the other presentation .    as a modern connection , we note that reciprocal diagrams were rediscovered as a technique to check whether a given plane drawing is the exact projection of a spatial polyhedron or a polyhedral surface  @xcite . here",
    "the reciprocal diagram is also called the ` gradient diagram ' , since the vertices of the reciprocal can be located as the points of intersection of normals to the faces of the original polyhedron , with the projection plane , with all normals drawn from a fixed center above the plane .",
    "these points are the gradients representing the slopes of the faces .",
    "this gradient diagram is a maxwell reciprocal with reciprocal edges perpendicular to the edges of the original @xcite .",
    "a related construction , starting with points on the paraboloid @xmath4 and their convex hull , creates the delaunay triangulation of the projected points , with the voronoi cells as a ( maxwell ) reciprocal diagram @xcite .",
    "here we pull together planar embeddings with the theory of reciprocals : we investigate when both the original graph drawing , or framework , and the reciprocal diagram are crossing free .",
    "we show in section  [ sectsimultaneously ] that interior faces of both drawings must be pseudo - triangles or pseudo - quadrangles , the outer boundary must be convex , and the self - stress generating the reciprocal must have a specific type of sign pattern .",
    "with one additional geometric condition on the self - stress at non - pointed vertices , these conditions become both necessary and sufficient for creating a reciprocal pair of non - crossing frameworks .",
    "the cases where the framework is a laman circuit ( an edge - minimal graph that can sustain a self - stress in a generic embedding ) , a pseudo - triangulation , or has a unique non - pointed vertex , are specially interesting , and addressed separately .",
    "there is a case that combines the three just mentioned : that of laman circuits embedded as pseudo - triangulations .",
    "previous work @xcite shows that all planar laman circuits admit such embeddings , and they have a unique non - pointed vertex . in section  [ sectsimultcirc ]",
    "we show that they produce non - crossing reciprocals . for sufficiently generic embeddings",
    "the reciprocals are also laman circuits realized as pseudo - triangulations with one non - pointed vertex , so the pairing is a complete reciprocity .",
    "this result is extended to the laman circuits realized as non - generic pseudo - triangulations , with self - stresses that are zero on some edges , again showing that the reciprocal is a pseudo - triangulation ( with several non - pointed vertices , in general )",
    ". moreover , any pseudo - triangulation with a self - stress and a non - crossing reciprocal occurs in a pair with a possibly singular pseudo - triangulation on a laman circuit .    section  [ sectlift ] studies the characteristic features of the lifts of such non - crossing reciprocal pairs . essentially , they look like negatively curved surfaces with a unique singularity at the vertex whose reciprocal is the outer face . in particular , that vertex is the unique local maximum of the surface , the outer face is the unique local minimum , and there are no ( horizontal ) saddle - points .",

    "in this section we assume no sign is zero , which is not really a loss of generality : if a self - stress is zero on some edges then it is a self - stress on the subframework on which it is not zero and the reciprocal depends only on that subframework .    in the reciprocal framework",

    "vertex - proper_. the reason for this terminology is that when rotating a ray around a vertex , the fastest ( `` proper '' ) way of going from an edge to the next one is to keep the direction of the ray for a convex angle and to change to the opposite ray ( `` changing signs '' ) when the angle is reflex .",

    "must be satisfied in both .",

    "2 .   pointed vertices with four sign changes , one of them at the big angle .",
    "non - pointed vertices , including any vertices with a flat angle , with four sign changes .",
    "moreover , vertices of @xmath6 in each of the cases , , and correspond respectively to faces of @xmath33 in the same parts of theorem  [ theorem - face - conditions ] , and vice versa .",
    "each of the cases of theorem  [ theorem - face - conditions ] , applied to a face in @xmath33 , gives the condition stated here for the reciprocal vertex of @xmath6 .",
    "see figures  [ figureorden0822bc][figureorden0822da ] .",
    "we will show below that the vertex conditions of theorem  [ theorem - vertex - conditions ] actually imply the face conditions of theorem  [ theorem - face - conditions ] .",
    "both the face and the vertex conditions admit a simple rephrasing in terms of vertex - proper and face - proper angles .",
    "namely :    1 .",
    "the face conditions are that there is exactly one vertex - proper angle in every pseudo - triangle , and no vertex - proper angle in the pseudo - quadrangles and the outer face .",
    "the vertex conditions are that there are exactly three face - proper angles at every pointed vertex and four at every non - pointed vertex other than the one reciprocal to the outer face , which has no face - proper angle .",
    "observe that a pseudo-@xmath22-gon with @xmath22 even ( resp .",
    ", @xmath22 odd ) must have an even ( resp .",
    ", odd ) number of vertex - proper angles , simply because it has an even number of sign changes . hence , the face conditions are that this number is as small as possible : 0 for pseudo - quadrangles and the outer face , 1 for pseudo - triangles",
    ".    similarly , the number of face - proper angles around a non - pointed ( resp . , pointed ) vertex must be even ( resp . ,",
    "again , the vertex conditions are that this number is as small as possible for the distinguished non - pointed vertex and for all pointed vertices ( but not for other non - pointed vertices ) , as the following result shows :    [ lemmapointed ] a self - stress produces at least three face - proper angles at every pointed vertex @xmath73 , ( unless it is zero on all edges incident to  @xmath73 ) .    observe that in order to meet the equilibrium condition around a vertex , no line can separate the positive edges of the self - stress incident to that vertex from the negative ones . in the case of a pointed vertex",
    "this rules out the possibility of having just one face - proper angle . indeed , if the face - proper angle is at the reflex angle then all signs are equal , and a tangent line to the point does the job . if the face - proper angle is convex , then a line through that angle does it .",
    "since the number of face - proper angles at a pointed vertex is odd , it must be at least three .    in theorem  [ theoremuniquemax ] , we prove an extra condition that the signs of a self - stress must satisfy in order to have a non - crossing reciprocal : the edges in the boundary cycle have opposite sign to those around the distinguished non - pointed vertex ( the one whose reciprocal is the outer face ) .",
    "the proof uses the relation between self - stresses and polyhedral liftings of frameworks .",
    "unfortunately , the purely combinatorial conditions on the signs of the self - stress stated in theorems  [ theorem - face - conditions ] and  [ theorem - vertex - conditions ] are not sufficient to guarantee that the reciprocal is non - crossing .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ figuresignvsframe ]    ]    where a framework and a self - stress satisfying them is shown in ( a ) , but its reciprocal ( b ) has crossings .",
    "it has to be noted that this example is a geometric circuit ; in particular it has a unique self - stress ( up to a constant ) .",
    "part ( c ) of the same figure shows a slightly different embedding of the same graph , for which the reciprocal ( d ) turns out to be non - crossing",
    ". in particular , there can be no purely combinatorial characterization ( that would depend only on the signs of the self - stress and on which angles are big / small ) of what frameworks have a planar reciprocal .",
    "but it is easy to analyze what goes wrong in this example : the signs around the interior vertex of degree five in part ( a ) should produce a pseudo - quadrangle , but instead , it produces a self - intersecting closed curve ( which can be regarded as a `` self - intersecting pseudo - quadrangle '' ) .",
    "the following statement tells us that such self - intersecting pseudo - quadrangles are actually the only thing that can prevent a non - crossing framework with the appropriate signs in its self - stress from having a non - crossing reciprocal :    [ badquadrangles ] let @xmath6 be non - crossing framework with a given self - stress @xmath102 .",
    "the reciprocal is non - crossing if and only if the signs of the self - stress around every vertex satisfy the conditions of theorem  [ theoremsimultaneous ] and , in addition , the face cycles reciprocal to the non - pointed vertices with four sign changes are themselves non - crossing ( and hence , pseudo - quadrangles ) .    that the reciprocal cycles of every vertex of @xmath6 need to be non - crossing for the reciprocal to be non - crossing is obvious . the reason why we only impose the condition on vertices of type ( 2.c ) is that the reciprocal cycles of vertices of types ( 1 ) , ( 2.a ) and ( 2.b ) are automatically non - crossing : there are no self - intersecting convex polygons or pseudo - triangles .",
    "let us see sufficiency .",
    "the conditions we now have on vertex cycles tell us that we have a collection of simple polygons ( one of them exterior to its boundary cycle , containing all the `` infinity '' part of the plane ) and that these polygons can locally be glued to one another : for every edge of every polygon there is a well - defined matching edge of another polygon .",
    "moreover , the fact that the orientations are all consistent implies that the two matching polygons for a given edge lie on opposite sides of that edge .    if we glue all these polygons together ( which can be done for any reciprocal , non - crossing or not ) what we get is a map from the topological dual of the framework @xmath6 ( with a point removed , in the interior of the face reciprocal to the distinguished non - pointed vertex ) to the euclidean plane .",
    "the local argument shows that this map is a covering map , except perhaps at vertices where in principle the map could wind - up two or more complete turns . but",
    "the covering map clearly covers infinity once , hence by continuity it covers everything once .",
    "this implies that the map is actually a homeomorphism .",
    "that is , that the reciprocal framework is non - crossing .",
    "one can say what the extra condition in theorem  [ badquadrangles ] means for the values of the self - stress in more explicit terms . for this",
    ", observe that a closed cycle is self - intersecting if and only if it can be decomposed into two cycles .",
    "translated to a vertex @xmath73 of @xmath6 this means that there are two edges @xmath35 and @xmath103 around @xmath73 such that the self - stress ( restricted to the edges around @xmath73 and the equilibrium condition at @xmath73 ) can be `` split '' into two self - stresses , one supported on the edges on one side of @xmath35 and @xmath103 and another on the edges on the other side . @xmath35 and @xmath103 are allowed to be used in both self - stresses , but if so with the same sign they have in the original self - stress .    to see this equivalence , the reader just needs to remember how to construct the reciprocal cycle of a given self - stressed vertex : consider all edges incident to @xmath73 oriented going out of @xmath73 and then place them one after another ( the end of one coinciding with the beginning of the next one ) , scaling each edge by the value of the self - stress on that edge ; in particular , reversing the edge if the self - stress is negative .",

    "we can now do a sweep around the maximal hub : we start with the plane of a face , then we rotate the plane about an adjacent spoke until we reach the next face , etc .",
    "the normals to these tangent planes track the reciprocal polygon , with a reciprocal vertex for the normal to each of the faces .",
    "if the base of the pyramid is not a convex polygon , then there is some segment of the convex hull between two vertices of the base polygon which does not lie in the polygon , placing all other vertices into one half - plane ( figure  [ figurecutwheels]b ) .",
    "consider the plane @xmath146 formed by this segment and the hub in space .",
    "this plane will place all of the pyramid in one half - space , touching it in at least two spokes .",
    "we claim that the normal @xmath61 to this plane is a crossing point of the reciprocal polygon .",
    "as we sweep around a spoke that lies in  @xmath146 , we will encounter @xmath146 as one of the tangent planes , and hence @xmath61 will appear on the edge reciprocal to the spoke .",
    "since this happens for at least two spokes , the reciprocal polygon is self - intersecting at @xmath61 .    since we know that the reciprocal polygon is non - crossing ( and non - touching ) we conclude that the original pyramid base must be a convex polygon .",
    "a direct analysis of the wheel now guarantees that all the signs of the spokes of the wheel are the same  and are opposite to the rim of the wheel , representing ridges . since the stress , and the signs , at the hub are the same in the larger framework",
    ", we conclude that any maximal vertex has all signs the same , and these signs are opposite to the boundary of the framework .    by theorem  [ theoremsimultaneous ] , we know that there is only one vertex with no sign changes in each side of a reciprocal pair of non - crossing frameworks , and that this vertex is the reciprocal of the boundary of the other framework in the pair .",
    "we conclude that there is a unique local maximum  the global maximum .",
    "this global maximum corresponds to the convex boundary polygon in the reciprocal .",
    "thus we have proved part  ( i ) of the theorem for a local maximum consisting of an isolated vertex .    if we can cut off a vertex @xmath73 of the lifting with a plane @xmath147 which is not necessarily horizontal , but cuts all edges between @xmath73 and its neighbors , the above argument applies without change .",
    "this section will still produce a spatial wheel which will project into a plane wheel with the hub inside the rim .",
    "any such vertex would have to be the reciprocal vertex of the boundary , and since this vertex is unique , we have proved statement  ( ii ) of the theorem .",
    "let us consider the case that a local maximum is not just a vertex but a larger connected set @xmath148 consisting of horizontal lines and horizontal faces .",
    "we can apply the argument of the previous paragraph to any vertex of the convex hull of  @xmath148 .",
    "given any local minimum that is not on the boundary , the same argument about the pyramid cut , and the sense of the reciprocal polygon applies .",
    "this gives a contradiction , so the only local minimum is along the boundary face , proving part  ( iii ) .",
    "statement  ( ii ) can be interpreted as saying that the maximum is the only ( locally ) strictly convex vertex of the surface .",
    "however , it is possible for a vertex @xmath73 to have all adjacent vertices in a _ closed _ half - space through @xmath73 .",
    "this can only happen for a pointed vertex and the half - space bounded by the plane of the face into which it points will for a pointed vertex .",
    "in particular , all boundary vertices have this property .",
    "we can derive the following consequences of the previous theorem :    [ corollaryopposite ] in a good self - stress , the edges incident to the distinguished non - pointed vertex have sign opposite to that of the boundary cycle .",
    "since the distinguished vertex is the maximum of the standard lifting , some ( hence all ) of its adjacent edges are ridges in it . in the contrary ,",
    "the boundary edges are valleys by definition of the standard lifting .",
    "[ corollarylevelcurves ] in the lifting of a good self - stress there are no ( horizontal ) saddle points .",
    "all level curves are simple closed curves , and as we increase the height the level curve moves monotonically from the boundary cycle to the distinguished non - pointed vertex .",
    "the reader has to observe , however , that the intermediate level curves need not be convex , even tough the boundary cycle and the level curves sufficiently close to the tip are convex .",
    "this happens , for example , in figure  [ figurenpr1both ] .",
    "there can not be any saddle points , because general morse theory on a disc with a horizontal boundary shows that a saddle point would require an additional local maximum or a new local minimum . in the absence of saddle points",
    ", morse theory also implies that all level curves are isotopic to one another , hence they are all simple closed curves because the boundary cycle is .",
    "[ corollary - twisted - saddle ] for any vertex except the maximum , there is a plane through that vertex that cuts the neighborhood in the `` saddle - point '' way into @xmath149 pieces .",
    "no plane through a vertex cuts the neighborhood into more than @xmath149 pieces , i.  e. , there are no `` multiple saddles '' .    more precisely , for every general direction in the interior of the reciprocal figure there is a unique vertex such that a plane with this normal through the vertex cuts the neighborhood in the `` saddle - point '' way into @xmath149 pieces . for planes with this normal ,",
    "all other vertex neighborhoods are cut into two pieces , with the exception of the peak , whose neighborhood lies entirely below the plane . for all directions in the outer face of the reciprocal , a plane with that normal will cut the neighborhood of every vertex , including the peak , into two pieces .",
    "the neighborhood of @xmath73 consists of an alternating cyclic sequence of edges emanating from @xmath73 and faces between those edges ; in the face @xmath150 reciprocal to @xmath73 , these correspond to vertices and edges , respectively .    for a given plane @xmath146 through @xmath73",
    ", we want to count how many faces incident to @xmath73 it intersects . in order to determine whether it intersects a given face @xmath83 between two neighboring edges @xmath88 and @xmath89 emanating from @xmath73 , we look at the relation between the reciprocal normal vector @xmath151 and the reciprocal vertex @xmath152 , forming an angle of @xmath150 with the incident edges @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath146 intersects @xmath83 if and only if    * @xmath153 and @xmath154 have different signs and the line through @xmath151 and @xmath152 `` cuts through '' the boundary of @xmath150 at @xmath152 , or * @xmath153 and @xmath154 have the same sign and the line through @xmath151 and @xmath152 is `` tangent '' to the boundary of @xmath150 at @xmath152 .    we know that the signs around @xmath150 have to satisfy the face conditions .",
    "it follows that @xmath151 has the above - mentioned relation to precisely 4 vertices of a face @xmath150 if @xmath151 lies in @xmath150 , and to precisely 2 vertices of @xmath150 if @xmath151 lies outside @xmath150 .",
    "this holds for the interior faces of the reciprocal ( pseudo - triangles and pseudo - quadrangles ) , and it can be easily proved by checking a few elementary cases and then showing that the number of `` related '' vertices does not changes as one moves @xmath151 , except when crossing the boundary of  @xmath150 .    when @xmath73 is the peak and @xmath150 is the outer face , @xmath151 is related to precisely 2 vertices of @xmath150 if it lies in the outer face , and to no vertices otherwise .",
    "the desired statements now follow easily .",
    "( the first part of the theorem , which is only a local statement about the neighborhood of @xmath73 , can also be proved directly in the original framework along the lines of the proof of theorem  [ theoremuniquemax ] by considering the geometry and the possible sign patterns of edges between two intersections with  @xmath146 . )",
    "the behavior exhibited in the previous corollary is analogous to what happens in the upper half of the _ pseudosphere _ , which is a surface in 3-space which serves as a model for ( a part of ) the hyperbolic plane , and has constant negative curvature everywhere .",

    "there are some similarities , in particular regarding the twisted saddle property discussed in proposition  [ corollary - twisted - saddle ] , but we have not explored whether there are any deeper connections to our present work .",
    "throughout this section we say that a non - crossing framework is _ good _ if it has some good self - stress , i.  e. , an everywhere non - zero stress that produces a non - crossing reciprocal .",
    "in particular , every almost pointed non - crossing framework is good .",
    "we do not define a framework to be good if _ all _ its self - stresses are good , simply because every framework with at least two ( linearly independent ) self - stresses has some bad self - stresses .",
    "indeed , let @xmath163 and @xmath164 be two independent everywhere non - zero self - stresses on a framework , and suppose they are both good .",

    "our characterization in   [ sectsimultaneously ] applies to all non - crossing reciprocal pairs based on a graph @xmath0 and its dual @xmath30 on the induced face structure of the embedding . in general , these reciprocal pairs are composed of pseudo - triangles and pseudo - quadrangles , with at least one non - pointed vertex .",
    "figure  [ figurenpr1both](a )    ]    contains such a pair of non - crossing reciprocals on a laman circuit , with the sign pattern of the corresponding self - stress , as predicted by theorem  [ theoremsimultaneous ] , and figure  [ figurenpr1both]b shows the lifts guaranteed by maxwell s theorem .",

    "we note that a small additional change in location , away from the original pair across this singularity , can make this pseudo - quadrangulation bad as the sign pattern is altered on the singular edge , see figure  [ figurepseudoquadbad ] .    ]",
    "this illustrates that , once we leave the realm of pseudo - triangulations , the big and small angles are not sufficient to determine whether even a generic framework on a laman circuit has a good self stress .",
    "[ open1 ] characterize directly by their geometric properties as embeddings , all non - crossing frameworks on a laman circuit @xmath0 with a non - crossing reciprocal .",
    "like all characteristics of a self - stress , the existence of a good self - stress on a framework is invariant under any _ external projective transformation of the plane _ , that is , a projective transformation in which the line being sent to infinity does not intersect any of the vertices or edges of the original framework .",
    "this invariance is a direct consequence of the map on the stress - coefficients induced by such a projective transformation , which does not change any signs and preserves all equilibria @xcite .",
    "these two properties of the map guarantee that all the necessary and sufficient conditions of  [ sectsimultaneously ] are preserved .    however , whatever projective property is required for a good self - stress , it is more refined than the simple choice of large and small angles , or even the oriented matroid of the vertices themselves .",
    "we do not have a firm conjecture for the geometry in the framework which determines that there is a good self - stress .",
    "such a good self - stress will be singular on any refinement of the framework to a pseudo - triangulation .",
    "the pure condition polynomials mentioned in the introduction , which are zero for edges dropped in a singular self - stress , are projective invariants @xcite . recall figure  [ figurepseudononcircuit ] , where the condition was the concurrence of three lines .",
    "it is possible that all the necessary information lies in the geometry of singular self - stresses on a pseudo - triangulation refining the pseudo - quadrangulation .",
    "it is natural to start with a non - crossing laman circuit pseudo - triangulation and generate denser examples by adding edges .",
    "but the refinement process does not preserve `` goodness '' in general , even if it is made with no addition of vertices .",
    "in figure  [ figurecounter ] we show an example of this .",
    "the framework on the left , without the edge @xmath172 , is an almost - pointed pseudo - triangulation , whose unique self - stress is by our results good ( its reciprocal is on the right ) .",
    "we claim that if we add the edge @xmath172 then there is no good everywhere - non - zero self - stress on the framework . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath163 be the self - stress of the pseudo - triangulation and let @xmath164 be the self - stress with support on the subgraph induced by the vertices @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath35 and @xmath175 ( including the edge @xmath172 ) . since this subgraph can be lifted to a roof - like surface , @xmath164 has one sign , say negative , on the boundary and the opposite sign in the interior .",
    "we assume that @xmath163 was also negative on the boundary .",
    "it turns out that @xmath163 and @xmath164 generate the space of self - stresses of the whole graph , but no linear combination @xmath176 will give alternating signs to the edges of the quadrilateral @xmath177 : if @xmath178 then @xmath179 and @xmath172 get the same sign ; if @xmath180 then @xmath181 and @xmath172 do .    ]    however , if a good pseudo - triangulation @xmath6 is refined to another pseudo - triangulation @xmath182 without adding vertices , we conjecture that @xmath182 is good too .",
    "our reason for this conjecture is that it is easy to prove that , at least , there is a self - stress in @xmath182 satisfying the vertex conditions of theorem  [ theorem - vertex - conditions ] .",
    "the idea of the proof is that one can go from @xmath6 to @xmath182 via a sequence of `` elementary refinements '' of one of the following types : addition of a single edge to divide a pseudo - triangle into two , or addition of three edges forming a triangle that separates the three corners of a pseudo - triangle , dividing it in four pseudo - triangles .",
    "( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  3 ) for a formal argument that these refinements are sufficient . ) in both cases , a simple case study together with elementary properties of self - stresses gives the required sign pattern .",
    "our conjecture reduces only to prove that the extra condition ruling out bad quadrangles can be obtained too .",
    "is it true that every pseudo - triangulation refinement ( with no extra vertices ) of a good pseudo - triangulation is good ?    and",
    "if one allows something more than simply adding edges :    to what extent can non - crossing reciprocal pairs be generated from laman circuit pseudo - triangulations via refinement ?",
    "solving any of these two problems could be a step towards the first problem we posed .",
    "liftings of pseudo - triangulations have also emerged recently in the context of `` locally convex '' functions over a polygonal domain subject to certain height restrictions  @xcite .",
    "we have seen here that , given a pair of frameworks whose reciprocals are both non - crossing , the lifted surface of each framework shares some characteristic properties of a pseudo - sphere .",
    "it would be of interest to see if this resemblance increases with the density of the framework .",
    "let @xmath183 be a sequence of laman circuit pseudo - triangulations such that each @xmath184 is obtained from @xmath185 by a making a henneberg ii move in a randomly selected face .",
    "with an appropriate normalization of the stresses , this defines a sequence of lifted surfaces , all of which have negative discrete curvature at every vertex except for a single maximum vertex .",
    "does this process converge to some limit ?",
    "what can be said about the limiting surface ?",
    "are there combinatorial conditions on the sequence of frameworks that ensure that the limit is something like a smooth pseudo - sphere ?",
    "one could ask the same question with a different model of generating `` random '' laman circuits .",
    "for example , the ppt - polytope of  @xcite is a polytope whose vertices are in one - to - one correspondence with the pointed pseudo - triangulations on a given point set . choosing an extreme vertex in a random direction , ( for a randomly generated point set ) produced a pseudo - triangulation , to which we can add an edge to create a `` random '' laman circuit .",
    "limit shapes like this have appeared in other contexts , for example for random convex polygons  @xcite .",
    "the results in  [ sectlift ] interpreted necessary conditions in  [ sectsimultaneously ] on the self - stress at the vertices and faces of the original non - crossing framework as necessary conditions on the lifting .",
    "it is natural to reverse this idea by starting from a piecewise - linear surface and projecting it back to the plane .",
    "which properties of a surface are necessary and sufficient ?    [ open2 ] characterize geometrically exactly which piecewise - linear spatial surfaces , projecting 1 - 1 onto the entire plane , project to planar frameworks with non - crossing reciprocals .",
    "if a graph admits several topologically different embeddings in the plane , one may decide to construct the reciprocal of a non - crossing framework on that graph taking as face and vertex cycles those of a different plane embedding from the one given by the framework . or",
    "one may not allow this but decide to call the reciprocal non - crossing if it is non - crossing as a geometric graph , even if its face structure is not dual to the one in the original .",
    "our characterizations of non - crossing reciprocal pairs do not address these situations .",
    "note that this is only an issue for non-3-connected graphs , and that graphs with cut vertices need not be considered : every self - stress can be decomposed as a sum of self - stresses supported in 2-connected components .",
    "there are two questions that should be addressed here .",
    "is there a non - crossing framework @xmath0 ( necessarily @xmath72-connected but not @xmath1-connected ) whose natural reciprocal has no crossing edges but is embedded differently from the graph - theoretic planar dual of @xmath0 ?",
    "we know that this can not happen when @xmath0 is a laman circuit ( see theorem  [ theoremsimultchararct ] ) , but for frameworks with more edges , the question is open .",
    "characterize pairs of non - crossing frameworks which are reciprocals to one another , but not necessarily with respect to the face and vertex cycles given by their embeddings as frameworks .",
    "we finish with perhaps the broadest question of all :    given a @xmath72-rigid planar graph , decide ( give a characterization , or at least a reasonable algorithm ) whether there is a non - crossing generic embedding of it that has a good self - stress .",
    "we know for example that for all laman circuits such an embedding exists : any generic pseudo - triangulation embedding works . in order for a generic framework to have a a self - stress on all edges , it must be @xmath72-rigid  remain rigid after deletion of any one edge @xcite .",
