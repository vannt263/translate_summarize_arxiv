    "the purpose of this paper is to present the yale - potsdam stellar isochrones ( yapsi ) , a new grid of stellar evolutionary calculations covering the low and intermediate mass regimes from the early pre - main sequence to the end of the red giant branch phase .",
    "our grid features a dense coverage of the mass range @xmath1 to @xmath11 that permits accurate interpolation in mass .",
    "a broad range of solar - scaled initial compositions is available , with metallicity in the range [ fe / h]@xmath12 to @xmath4 , and helium content @xmath13 to @xmath6 .    as a follow - up and extension of a previous paper @xcite ,",
    "a special emphasis of this work is on the construction of accurate mass - luminosity and mass - radius relations , in particular for low - mass stars ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the focus of the yapsi models tries to reflect the novel or recently renewed interests of the stellar physics community , for example in the characterization of open clusters ( e.g. , the wiyn open cluster study , @xcite , or the monitor project , @xcite ) , and even of field stars ( e.g. , gyrochronology : @xcite ; asteroseismology : @xcite ; direct interferometric measurement of stellar radii : @xcite ) , in the wake of space missions such as corot and _ kepler _ , and at the dawn of the gaia era ( gaia data release 1 has just been made public : * ? ? ?",
    "the theory of low - mass stars and substellar objects has a long history and presents peculiar challenges , most notably the treatment of the atmospheric boundary conditions and the equation of state ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "decisive improvement in these pieces of input physics were included in the lyon models of @xcite , which have been for a long time one of the main references for theoretical models of low and very - low - mass stars . since then",
    ", these authors have updated their calculations @xcite , while other groups have expanded and improved their grids towards the low - mass regime ( dartmouth : @xcite ; padova / parsec : @xcite ; victoria - regina : @xcite ; mesa : @xcite , among others ) .    in this sense ,",
    "the yapsi release is intended as an update and an extension of the yonsei - yale isochrones ( yy hereafter : @xcite ) , featuring models of low - mass stars that incorporate the latest improvements in the relevant input physics , and homogenizing the results of an early release @xcite with the yy database .",
    "care has been taken , whenever possible , to preserve compatibility with the utility codes developed for yy .",
    "some of the applications for which we envisage that the yapsi models are especially well - suited are highlighted as follows .",
    "the mass - luminosity relation ( mlr in the following ) and the mass - radius relation play a fundamental role in stellar astrophysics ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "they are especially important for exoplanet - host stars : the planetary radii are determined relative to ( and therefore only as accurately as ) the radius of their host star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the mlr provides both a stringent test of the input physics included in stellar models @xcite , and a crucial link between the luminosity of a star and its mass @xcite .",
    "the best empirical mlr for low - mass stars available so far , the result of more than 20 years of observational work , has just been published @xcite .",
    "the yapsi models are compared with this exquisitely precise empirical relation in section [ ssec_benedict ] .",
    "the mass - radius relation has received a great deal of attention in the context of the so - called  radius inflation problem \" . when sufficiently accurate measurements of stellar masses and radii are simultaneously available , stars of mass @xmath15 are found to have radii inflated by about @xmath16@xmath17 with respect to model predictions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ; see also section [ ssec_rinfl ] ) .",
    "the explanation of this discrepancy has been intriguingly linked by many authors to some piece of missing physics in the models , such as magnetic activity @xcite , magnetic fields @xcite , or , indirectly , to rotation @xcite .",
    "the yapsi tracks also include rotation - related stellar parameters , such as the moments of inertia or the convective turnover time scale , that are useful in studies of the angular momentum evolution in stellar interiors ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in applying the stellar age - dating technique of gyrochronology @xcite .    for detailed modeling of specific stars , we provide an interface between the yapsi tracks and an open - source , freely available ` fortran ` code that automatically performs a best - fitting search of the observed stellar parameters using a monte carlo markov - chain approach",
    "finally , the yapsi models can be useful in the classical isochrone fitting of the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of open and globular stellar clusters ( see section [ ssec_clusters ] ) .",
    "notably , the chemical compositions available in yapsi include , in addition to a typical span of metallicities , a broader range of helium abundances than is usually considered ; moreover , these two quantities are assigned independently of each other , i.e. , the full range of helium abundances is available at each metallicity .",
    "this is in contrast with the more widespread choice in the literature , where helium content is constrained to remain in lockstep with metallicity through a fixed @xmath7 relation , assigned on the basis of a galactic nucleosynthesis model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the plausibility of stellar helium abundances being locally uncorrelated with metallicity has been discussed in the literature in the past in several contexts ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and more recently @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the choice of independent metallicity and helium abundance parameters provides not only additional flexibility in stellar population studies , but also the ability to explore binaries and multiple stars that may have undergone enrichment through interaction during their evolution .",
    "together with the yapsi isochrones , we provide a ` fortran ` routine for interpolation in age , metallicity , and helium content , similar to the code available for the yy isochrones .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the input physics included in the models is discussed in section [ sec_input ] .",
    "the parameters of the grid and the stellar evolution tracks are described in section [ sec_tracks ] . the isochrones and their newly - implemented construction procedure",
    "are presented in section [ sec_isochrones ] . in section [ sec_observations ]",
    "we compare the yapsi mass - luminosity and mass - radius relations with the best observations available , and we discuss the isochrone fitting of the color - magnitude diagrams of selected open and globular stellar clusters .",
    "the models in the grid have been constructed using the yale rotational stellar evolution code ( yrec ) in its non - rotational configuration @xcite .",
    "the details of the microphysics used are as follows .",
    "the code uses the opal rosseland mean opacities in the temperature range @xmath18 @xcite , ramped with the  low temperature \" opacities of @xcite for @xmath19 .",
    "conductive opacities corrections are introduced for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , using an analytical fit based on the work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we adopt the @xcite value of the solar metallicity , @xmath22 .",
    "the treatment of convection is based on the mixing length theory @xcite , according to the formulation of @xcite .",
    "the extent of convective core overshoot is assumed to be proportional to the local pressure scale height @xmath23 at the edge of the core ( as defined by the schwarzschild criterion ) , scaled by the factor @xmath24 .",
    "the pressure scale height , however , approaches infinity at the stellar center , and it becomes physically unrealistic as a measure of overshoot length when the convective core is very small . as a solution ,",
    "our code uses the simple recipe suggested by @xcite , which limits the core overshoot length scale to a fraction of the geometrical distance to the stellar center .",
    "we assign @xmath24 according to the recent work of @xcite .",
    "these authors have determined the best - fitting value of the core overshoot parameter for a sample of accurately characterized stars , strategically distributed across the hr diagram to constrain its mass dependence . although the sample spans the range @xmath25 [ fe / h ] @xmath26 , no dependence of @xmath24 on metallicity was found .",
    "we have constructed a ramping function to fit the semi - empirical determinations of @xmath24 by @xcite ; see figure [ coreovsh ] .",
    "this can be contrasted with the approach in paper iv of yy @xcite , in which an estimate to the value of @xmath24 is taken to match the observed cmds of stellar clusters .",
    "other such approximations have been introduced by @xcite . for another approach to core overshoot , based on a diffusive treatment , see @xcite .     by @xcite ( black points ) are plotted together with our ramping function ( red line).,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    the standard choices of the equation of state ( eos ) and of the surface boundary conditions in yrec are the opal 2005 eos @xcite and the classical eddington gray @xmath27@xmath28 relationship , respectively . in order to meet the specific input physics requirements of low - mass models @xcite , for tracks of mass @xmath29 , the scvh eos @xcite is ramped with the opal 2005 eos in regions where @xmath30 k @xmath31 k. moreover , for the same mass range , surface boundary conditions providing the photospheric pressure in tabular form , derived from ` phoenix ` atmospheric models @xcite , are used in place of the gray eddington @xmath27@xmath28 relation .",

    "both helium and heavy elements diffusion are implemented in our models , based on loeb s formulation @xcite .",
    "no extra mixing to limit the effect of diffusion is included ( as required to match the observed surface abundances of population ii stars : e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "mass loss is not taken into account .",
    "the nuclear energy generation rates are those recommended by @xcite . as noted by @xcite , the most significant difference with the rates of @xcite , adopted in the yy calculations , is for the reaction @xmath32 , which has been revised by a factor of @xmath33 .",
    "the eos and the surface boundary conditions depend on the stellar mass as follows :    * _  low - mass configuration \" _ , opal@xmath34scvh eos , ` phoenix`derived surface boundary conditions : for tracks in the mass range @xmath35 ; * _  standard configuration \" _ , opal eos , eddington gray surface boundary conditions : for tracks in the range @xmath36 .    the two subsets overlap between @xmath37 and @xmath38 , to allow for intercomparison of the results . at given mass and chemical composition ,",
    "the evolutionary track is most affected by the different eos and atmospheric boundary conditions choices during the pre - main sequence contraction and the red giant phase .",

    "although the two strategies yield results in good agreement with each other for masses larger than @xmath43 , below this threshold the latter alternative results in systematically lower @xmath10 at a given mass , and should be preferred on theoretical grounds ( e.g. , * ? ?",

    "isochrones generated for the same parameters using the interpolation tool are compared with the custom - made ones in figure  [ isotest ] .",
    "the agreement is , in general , quite good .",
    "we note , however , that the largest differences between the interpolated and custom - made isochrones are found in the shape of the main sequence turn - off .",
    "this should be taken into account for applications requiring very high accuracy .",

    "<S> we introduce the yale - potsdam stellar isochrones ( yapsi ) , a new grid of stellar evolution tracks and isochrones of solar - scaled composition . in an effort to improve the yonsei - yale database , </S>",
    "<S> special emphasis is placed on the construction of accurate low - mass models ( @xmath0 ) , and in particular of their mass - luminosity and mass - radius relations , both crucial in characterizing exoplanet - host stars and , in turn , their planetary systems . </S>",
    "<S> the yapsi models cover the mass range @xmath1 to @xmath2 , densely enough to permit detailed interpolation in mass , and the metallicity and helium abundance ranges [ fe / h ] @xmath3 to @xmath4 , and @xmath5 to @xmath6 , specified independently of each other ( i.e. , no fixed @xmath7 relation is assumed ) . </S>",
    "<S> the evolutionary tracks are calculated from the pre - main sequence up to the tip of the red giant branch . </S>",
    "<S> the isochrones , with ages between @xmath8 myr and @xmath9 gyr , provide ubvri colors in the johnson - cousins system , and jhk colors in the homogeneized bessell & brett system , derived from two different semi - empirical @xmath10-color calibrations from the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide utility codes , such as an isochrone interpolator in age , metallicity , and helium content , and an interface of the tracks with an open - source monte carlo markov - chain tool for the analysis of individual stars . finally , we present comparisons of the yapsi models with the best empirical mass - luminosity and mass - radius relations available to date , as well as isochrone fitting of well - studied stellar clusters . </S>"
