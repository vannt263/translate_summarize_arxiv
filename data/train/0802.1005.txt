    "[ prp : hy2 ] @xmath813 contains all of its transpositions ; by lemma [ lem : gross ] it contains any @xmath814 , @xmath815 .    for @xmath816 , let @xmath817 and notice that by lemmas [ lem : two ] and [ lem : three ] , @xmath475 ( this is not true if @xmath818 ) . since @xmath41 is even there exists a component of @xmath500 , @xmath447 , that contains a hyperelliptic element , @xmath86 , for which both zeroes of order @xmath41 are at branch points . by lemma",
    "[ lem : br ] , @xmath754 contains all transpositions of the two zeroes of order @xmath41 , and by lemma [ lem : gross ] it contains each of the @xmath135 null @xmath283 involving only those two zeroes",
    ". therefore lemma [ lem : gross ] implies any null @xmath283 consisting of a single zero of order @xmath41 moving around @xmath278 and @xmath41 zeroes of order 1 moving around @xmath279 is in @xmath813 .    if @xmath818 we let @xmath819 and note that @xmath475 . by the same argument as above there exists @xmath509 such that @xmath820 contains each of the @xmath135 null @xmath283 involving only the two zeroes of order 4 .",
    "thus we get the null @xmath283 involving a zero of order @xmath821 and @xmath821 zeroes of order 1 moving one way around @xmath278 , and 4 zeroes of order 1 moving the other .",
    "we compose and cancel with null @xmath283 involving points of order 1 to get a null @xmath283 with a zero of order 2 moving around @xmath278 and two zeroes of order 1 moving around @xmath279 .",
    "this gives us any null @xmath283 consisting of a single zero of higher order moving one way around @xmath278 and zeroes of order 1 moving the other .",
    "these and the @xmath814 where @xmath822 generate all null @xmath283 .",
    "notice that there are strata of the form specified in proposition [ prp : hy2 ] for which there exist null @xmath283 to which lemma [ lem : gross ] does not apply .",
    "for example , in @xmath823 we can have a null @xmath283 consisting of the point of order 20 moving one way around @xmath278 and 20 points of order 1 moving the other , but since there are not 20 distinct points of order 1 we can not collide them to use the technique of lemma [ lem : gross ] .",
    "finally we would like to consider when @xmath289-commutators are contained in @xmath15 .",
    "[ prp : comm ] let @xmath824 , where @xmath332 and the @xmath41 are as in proposition [ prp : null ] .",
    "then for any @xmath707 , any @xmath289-commutator is in @xmath825 .",
    "let @xmath826 be the zeroes of @xmath50 of weight 1 , and @xmath827 the zeroes of weight @xmath6 . where @xmath41 is by assumption is less than @xmath332 , @xmath137 . by proposition",
    "[ prp : null ] @xmath501 contains all of its null @xmath283 .",
    "thus the following is also in @xmath825 : @xmath828 for @xmath829 and @xmath830 , @xmath277 commutes with @xmath831 . if @xmath829 but @xmath832 then @xmath833 = @xmath834 where @xmath835 is a square transposition of @xmath307 , defined appropriately with respect to @xmath836 .",
    "for example , in figure [ fig : kappa ] we have two points going around @xmath453 on a torus and an explicitly defined @xmath184 , with @xmath837 .    thus if @xmath830 ( [ eq : rho1 ] ) is equal to : @xmath838 notice that the maximal value for @xmath5 is @xmath839 , and this implies that @xmath840 for any @xmath14 .",
    "the first of the two elements in parentheses in ( [ eq : rho2 ] ) is in the kernel of @xmath29 , so we may apply corollary [ cor : imv2 ] to show that it can be written as a product of transpositions .",
    "proposition [ prp : hy2 ] says that @xmath501 contains all of its transpositions ; thus the element on the left is in @xmath501 .",
    "this in turn implies implies @xmath841 .",
    "if @xmath842 then ( [ eq : rho1 ] ) is equal to ( [ eq : rho2 ] ) except that the first element in parentheses will contain some additional @xmath184 s . however it will still be in the kernel of @xmath29 and again @xmath841 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath171 a zero of higher order and @xmath600 an edge between @xmath843 , we would like to show that @xmath844 is in @xmath501 , so we consider the following :    @xmath845 by assumption both @xmath846 and the elements in parentheses are in @xmath501 , so the whole element is .",
    "since @xmath847 commutes with @xmath848 , commuting the @xmath849 as in ( [ eq : rho2 ] ) gives us the desired result .",
    "finally , any product of square transpositions of two higher order zeroes is contained in @xmath501 by proposition [ prp : hy2 ] , because it is a product of transpositions .",
    "this covers all possible generators of @xmath850 $ ] .",
    "we summarize by answering the question of when @xmath851 is equal to @xmath852 .",
    "proposition [ prp : triv ] implies @xmath854 . by theorem [ thm : gen ] and corollary [ cor : gen2 ] @xmath47",
    "is generated by transpositions , square transpositions , null @xmath283 and in some cases @xmath289-commutators .",
    "proposition [ prp : hy2 ] , proposition [ prp : null ] , and proposition [ prp : comm ] show that all of these elements are in @xmath852 .    in @xcite",
    ", copeland shows a similar result for @xmath810 and @xmath855 .",
    "his techniques are somewhat different and rely on the fact that in the top stratum one may interpolate two quadratic differentials and expect the result to be in the same stratum .",
    "thus , for certain @xmath16 we have constructed @xmath856 .",
    "of course , we are actually interested in @xmath15 and would thus like to determine the kernel of @xmath28 .",
    "however , it may be difficult to say anything about this kernel .",
    "for example , let @xmath855 .",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 are both smooth connected complex varieties and @xmath857 is a dominant morphism of varieties .",
    "a fiber of @xmath858 is a copy of @xmath859 with a codimension 1 subset removed , so it is connected and has at least one smooth point .",
    "then there is a non - empty zariski open set @xmath860 such that @xmath861 is a fibration ( see @xcite , for example ) , and for a generic fiber , @xmath862 , of @xmath858 we have the following short exact sequence : @xmath863 similarly consider the projection @xmath864 given by @xmath865 .",
    "again , both @xmath11 and @xmath1 are connected , smooth , complex varieties and @xmath866 is a dominant morphism .",
    "further , notice that @xmath867 .",
    "in other words , the fibers of @xmath866 may be viewed as a codimension @xmath14 subset of the fibers of @xmath858 .",
    "thus the fibers of @xmath866 are also all connected , containing at least one smooth point , and for a generic fiber , @xmath868 , of @xmath866 , we again have the ses : @xmath869 since @xmath1 is simply connected , @xmath15 is isomorphic to the fundamental group of a generic fiber of @xmath866 .",
    "( one would expect similar arguments apply to any @xmath16 such that a generic fiber of @xmath858 is connected - for example any @xmath16 of theorem [ thm : c1 ] ) .",
    "if a generic fiber of @xmath866 were also a generic fiber of @xmath858 then we would have @xmath870 and the kernel of @xmath28 would , in fact , be trivial",
    ". however , it is possible that this is not the case , and in general considering the fundamental groups of specific , possibly singular , fibers of @xmath858 seems to be difficult .",
    "again for @xmath855 , for example , these fibers correspond to the complement of discriminant hypersurfaces in @xmath859 and there is a great deal of literature on the subject , but very little dealing with arbitrarily singular fibers .",
