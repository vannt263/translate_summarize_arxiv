    "stellar - mass black holes ( bhs ) are mostly detected through dramatic x - ray outbursts exhibited by transient x - ray binaries ( sxts ; @xcite ) .",
    "about 60 bh candidates have been identified in the 50 year lifetime of x - ray astronomy @xcite , although only 17 of these have been confirmed by dynamical studies i.e. they possess a mass function @xmath15 in excess of 3 m@xmath14 , where @xmath16 is the mass ratio of the companion star to the compact object .",
    "the reason for the low rate of confirmed bhs lies in the difficulty of detecting the companion star for quiescent optical magnitudes fainter than @xmath1722 .",
    "time - resolved spectroscopy with signal - to - noise ratio @xmath18 is typically needed to detect the weak absorption features and trace their orbital motion .",
    "determining the binary mass ratio is even more challenging as it also requires resolving powers @xmath19 to measure the rotational broadening of the absorption lines ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , moderately short integration times are essential to avoid significant orbital smearing .",
    "it should be mentioned that alternative methods based on the radial velocities of the disc emission lines are uncertain and prone to large systematic effects ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a critical review on the determination of system parameters in bh sxts can be found in @xcite .    in @xcite ( henceforth paper i )",
    "we showed that the full - width - half maximum ( @xmath2 ) of the disc h@xmath3 line in quiescent bh sxts scales with the velocity semi - amplitude of the companion star .",
    "we here present the discovery of a another correlation between @xmath0 and the ratio of the double peak separation to the line width .",
    "both relations open the door to constrain fundamental parameters and perform dynamical studies in much fainter samples of quiescent bh candidates than is currently possible .",
    "we have selected a sample of quiescent spectra of nine dynamical bh and two neutron star ( ns ) sxts from paper i , all with reliable mass ratio determinations .",
    "only mass ratios obtained by resolving the rotational broadening of the companion star ( the @xmath20 technique ) have been considered .",
    "table 1 presents our sample and the associated references .",
    "full observational details for every target are given in paper i. for the case of xte j1118 + 480 , we decided to include also 34 additional spectra obtained with the 10.4 m gran telescopio canarias ( gtc ) and reported in @xcite . note that gro j0422 + 320 is not included despite having a @xmath0 determination through the @xmath20 technique .",
    "this is because the resolution of the only three quiescent spectra available to us is too poor ( @xmath21% of the double peak separation ) for a realistic determination of the double peak separation .    for comparison",
    "we have also chosen a sub - sample of quiescent cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) from paper i. from the 24 possible cvs with reliable @xmath0 determinations , 13 have been rejected because the line core is dominated by a strong s - wave component which prevents us from measuring the double peak separation with the simple model outlined below . in any case , these are all cvs with large mass ratios @xmath22 which , as we will show later , are not relevant to our analysis . from the remaining 11 cvs , three have @xmath0 values based on the @xmath20 technique ( gk per , ip peg and ctcv j1300 - 3052 ) and another two on a direct determination of the radial velocity curves of both the white dwarf and the donor star ( u gem and wz sge ) . in the remaining six the companion star is not directly observed but robust @xmath0 values are available through modeling the eclipse of the white dwarf and the hot spot ( see e.g. @xcite ) . our cv sample is listed in table 2 .",
    "double peak separations ( @xmath1 ) were obtained by fitting a symmetric 2-gaussian model to the average h@xmath3 profile in every sxt and cv . in the case of eclipsing cvs",
    "we excluded those spectra obtained within @xmath130.05 phases from the time of the central eclipse .",
    "the fitted model consists of a constant plus two gaussians of identical width and height .",
    "the continuum rectified spectra were fitted in a window of @xmath1310000 km s@xmath23 , centered on the h@xmath3 line after masking the neighboring hei line at @xmath246678 . prior to the fit",
    ", the 2-gaussian model was degraded to the resolution of the data by convolution with the instrumental profile% ) on the ratio @xmath7 because both quantities are almost equally affected .",
    "] we adopted 1-@xmath25 formal errors on the fitted parameter as derived through @xmath26 minimization .",
    "1 displays some fit examples using our 2-gaussian model .",
    "in addition , @xmath2 values were extracted from single gaussian fits to the same average h@xmath3 profiles following paper i.    tables 1 and 2 list the parameter @xmath7 and its propagated 1-@xmath25 error as derived from our gaussian model fits .",
    "the evolution of @xmath7 with @xmath0 is presented in fig .",
    "the figure shows that @xmath7 varies very rapidly for small @xmath0 values , with a 10% increase for @xmath0 under 0.2 .    in order to understand this behaviour",
    ", we follow on from paper i and start by assuming that the @xmath2 of the h@xmath3 line is determined by gas with keplerian velocity at a characteristic radius @xmath27 , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 the roche lobe of the compact star , i.e.    @xmath30    on the other hand , the double peak separation is set by the velocity of the outer disc , whose radius @xmath31 is truncated by the tidal forces of the companion star @xcite .",
    "there is ample evidence for the outer disc velocities to be sub - keplerian ( e.g. @xcite ) and thus we decided to adopt    @xmath32    where the parameter @xmath33 accounts for the fraction by which the outer disc material is sub - keplerian . for extreme mass ratios",
    "@xmath34 the disc is effectively truncated at the resonance radius of the ( j=3 , k=2 ) commensurability or 3:1 resonance radius i.e. the radius at which the disc angular velocity is three times the angular velocity of the companion star ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore ,    @xmath35    where @xmath36 the binary separation . if we now bring eq . 3 into eq . 2 and use eggleton s relation @xcite to remove @xmath37",
    "we find    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the same expression as in eq .",
    "6 of paper i , i.e.    @xmath40    by computing the ratio between the double peak separation and the line width we have managed to cancel out the dependence on compact object mass and binary inclination .",
    "interestingly , in contrast with the @xmath12 correlation presented in paper i , eq .",
    "4 is very sensitive to the mass ratio for @xmath34 i.e. the typical values achieved by bh sxts .    for the sake of comparison",
    ", we also plot eq . 4 in fig . 2 for @xmath41 ( adopted from paper i ) and @xmath42 .",
    "although not intended to be a fit , the alignment of the data with the model indicates that eq . 4 provides a good description of the observations",
    "this endorses our interpretation that the strong dependence of @xmath7 with @xmath0 is driven by the truncation of the outer disc radius caused by the 3:1 resonance tide .",
    "the bottom panel in fig .",
    "2 also displays the evolution of @xmath7 for the cv sample , with the model for @xmath41 and @xmath43 superimposed .",
    "the comparison of the sxt and cv data with the model indicates that the velocities at the outer accretion disc are sub - keplerian by @xmath620% , in good agreement with other studies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "note that for @xmath44 the 3:1 resonance lies beyond @xmath60.9 @xmath29 and the outer disc radius is then limited by the largest non - intersecting orbits allowed by three - body interactions @xcite . under these circumstances ,",
    "the dependence of the outer disc radius on @xmath0 is very weak @xcite and , therefore , a nearly constant evolution of @xmath7 versus @xmath0 is expected for @xmath44 .    for practical purposes , we display in fig .",
    "3 the variation of @xmath7 versus @xmath0 in logarithmic units . a least - squares linear fit yields    @xmath45    witha pearson correlation coefficient @xmath46 . in order to estimate the error in @xmath0 implied by this relation we have computed the difference with respect to the true observed values for our 11 sxts .",
    "the distribution of differences can be approximated by a normal function with @xmath47 .",
    "this indicates that mass ratios can be realistically obtained from eq .",
    "6 with a typical @xmath48% uncertainty .",
    "the spectra that we have used to produce the @xmath8 correlation are orbital averages .",
    "this is party because individual spectra rarely possess enough signal - to - noise for the technique to be applicable . but also , because orbital means average out possible asymmetries in individual spectra from , for example , hot - spots or disc eccentricitiies which could potentially bias the determination of @xmath0 .    at this point",
    "we decided to explore the impact of line asymmetries in the results of our technique . since this can only be tested on data with sufficient signal - to - noise we have focused on the 154 high quality gtc spectra of xte j1118 + 480 obtained along four different orbits over two years .",
    "we have performed gaussian fits on every individual spectrum and computed mass ratios using eq .",
    "the distribution of @xmath0 values is found to peak at @xmath49 ( bottom panel in fig .",
    "4 ) , with 68% of the values contained between @xmath50 and 0.045 .",
    "this indicates that , if @xmath0 were to be obtained from a single individual spectrum , the typical uncertainty would be about @xmath1756% .    in order to trace the effect of line asymmetries we also extracted the @xmath51 parameter from each spectrum , with @xmath51 defined as the ratio of equivalent widths between the blue and the red part of the h@xmath3 profile",
    "the two halves of the line are set from the rest wavelength till @xmath132500 km s@xmath23 .",
    "for example , @xmath52 indicates a line with the red part stronger by 20% while @xmath53 implies a symmetric profile . a plot of @xmath0 versus @xmath51 ( see top panel in fig .",
    "4 ) seems to show a trend , with asymmetric profiles preferring slightly lower @xmath0 values , although the large scatter prevents from drawing a firm conclusion .",
    "however , as we have mentioned above , the technique outlined in this paper is most useful on phase averaged spectra because individual spectra typically have very limited signal - to - noise .",
    "consequently , we have extracted @xmath0 values by fitting gaussians to the four orbital averages of the 154 individual spectra .",
    "the distribution of @xmath0 values has a mean at 0.026 and a standard deviation of 0.005 , indicating that the typical error on phase averaged spectra is reduced to @xmath1719% i.e. smaller than the 25% uncertainty drawn from the correlation .",
    "we therefore conclude that the uncertainty expected from the application of our technique to phase averaged spectra is about 32% .",
    "in paper i we showed that the @xmath2 of the h@xmath3 line in quiescent sxts and cvs is formed at @xmath5442% of @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , it is tightly correlated with the projected velocity of the donor star @xmath55 and thus , the quantity @xmath56 can be used to extract dynamical information from single epoch low resolution ( @xmath57 ) spectroscopy .",
    "in addition , we showed that @xmath56 is weakly dependent on @xmath0 , resulting in a @xmath1727% flatter slope for ( long - period ) cvs .",
    "we here now present a new method to estimate the binary mass ratio in quiescent bh sxts from the properties of the h@xmath3 line .",
    "we have proved that the quantity @xmath7 is strongly dependent on @xmath0 , with a 10% variation for @xmath34 .",
    "the reason behind this is the efficient truncation of the outer disc radius by the 3:1 tidal resonance of the donor star .",
    "the correlation of @xmath7 with @xmath0 , therefore , opens a new avenue to measure mass ratios in quiescent bh sxts .",
    "the double peak separation can be solidly measured by fitting a symmetric double - gaussian model to phase averaged h@xmath3 profiles .",
    "we estimate that instrumental resolution better than 25% of the double peak separation is required to resolve the latter .",
    "this typically demands resolving powers of only @xmath581000 i.e a factor @xmath59 lower than required to measure @xmath0 using the @xmath20 technique .",
    "more significantly for observational feasibility , this method makes use of the disc h@xmath3 line which , with a typical @xmath60   , is much stronger that the weak atmospheric features of the donor star .",
    "the relations presented in this paper and in paper i thus allow for a reasonably accurate estimation of the system parameters in very faint sxts which otherwise can not be tackled with current instrumentation and standard techniques . as an example , we have applied our method to the bh sxts xte j1650 - 500 , xte j1859 + 226 and swift j1357 - 0933 .",
    "they all have @xmath61 and none of them has yet a mass ratio determination .",
    "we have produced averaged spectra for xte j1650 - 500 and xte j1859 + 226 using the data presented in table 1 of paper i. regarding swift j1357 - 0933 we have used a more recent and extended database reported in @xcite .",
    "fig.5 displays the averaged spectra of the three bhs together with the best double - gaussian model fits , which result in @xmath62 , 0.5741@xmath130.0072 and 0.5805@xmath130.0027 for xte j1650 - 500 , xte j1859 + 226 and swift j1357 - 0933 respectively .",
    "the mass ratios implied by eq . 6 are @xmath9 , 0.049@xmath10 and 0.040@xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the quoted uncertainties correspond to 68% confidence regions and have been computed using a monte carlo simulation with @xmath63 realizations .",
    "we note in passing that our mass ratio for swift j1357 - 0933 is in excellent agreement with an independent estimate based on the radial velocity curve of the wings of the h@xmath3 line @xcite .",
    "regarding swift j1357 - 0933 we are now in a position to present a credible bh mass based on our scaling relations . by combining our mass ratio with the mass function obtained by means of the @xmath56 correlation @xcite and a conservative estimate of the inclination angle @xmath64 @xcite we find @xmath65 m@xmath14 .",
    "this result confirms swift j1357 - 0933 as one of the most massive bh low - mass x - ray binaries in the galaxy , only rivaled by grs 1915 + 105 @xcite .    to conclude we would like to stress that the relations presented here and in paper i will help deepen the search for new bh transients to substantially fainter limits .",
    "they will also prove very useful in extracting fundamental parameters from large numbers of data to be delivered by new spectroscopic surveys such as gaia or weave .",
    "we would like to acknowledge the hospitality of the department of physics of the university of oxford , where this work was performed during a sabbatical visit .",
    "we also thank the anonymous referee for valuable comments which helped to improve the quality of the paper .",
    "we are grateful to serena repetto for bringing to our attention a mass ratio determination based on the @xmath20 technique for n. vel 93 ( = grs 1009 - 45 ) .",
