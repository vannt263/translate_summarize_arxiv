    "some time ago bender et al@xcite stated that it is not known if the spectrum of the anharmonic oscillator potential @xmath0 is discrete .",
    "several years earlier simon@xcite had given five proofs that the spectrum of such oscillator is indeed discrete .",
    "we are not aware of any calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of that anharmonic oscillator .",
    "for this reason we will provide some reasonably accurate results in this paper . in section  [ sec : rrvm ] we outline the application of the rayleigh - ritz variational method taking into account the point - group symmetry of the oscillator . in section  [ sec : moments ] we discuss two approaches based on the moments of the hamiltonian operator : the rayleigh - ritz method in the krylov space ( rrk)@xcite ( and references therein ) and the connected - moments expansion ( cmx)@xcite . in section  [ sec : results ] we compare and discuss the results obtained by the three approaches and draw conclusions .",
    "as stated in the introduction , we are interested in the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the anharmonic oscillator @xmath1 in this section we outline the application of the well known rayleigh - ritz variational method .",
    "we choose products @xmath2 of eigenfunctions @xmath3 , @xmath4 , of the harmonic oscillator @xmath5 as a suitable basis set .    like the pullen - edmonds hamiltonian@xcite the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) is invariant under the symmetry operations of the point group @xmath6@xcite .",
    "therefore , the appropriate basis functions are @xmath7 where @xmath8 an obvious advantage of using point - group symmetry is that we diagonalize the hamiltonian matrix @xmath9 for each irreducible representation @xmath10 separately .",
    "what is more : we can even split the calculation for the two - dimensional irreducible representation @xmath11 into its two components , which decreases the dimension of the matrices still further .",
    "thus , point - group symmetry simplifies all the calculations and enables us to interpret the results more clearly .",
    "we will refer to this rayleigh - ritz method with the harmonic - oscillator basis set as rrho .",
    "in this section we discuss two methods based on the moments of the hamiltonian operator @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a properly chosen reference function .",
    "the first one is the rayleigh - ritz variational method in the krylov space ( rrk ) spanned by the non - orthogonal basis set of functions @xmath14 which has been successfully applied to the pullen - edmonds hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "the second approach is the connected - moments expansion ( cmx ) developed by cioslowski@xcite who tested it on the ground state of the pullen - edmonds hamiltonian .",
    "amore and fernndez@xcite carried out a calculation of much larger order on the ground and excited states by means of the compact and most elegant formula developed by knowles@xcite that we also use in this paper .",
    "for the application of both moments methods we resort to the following reference functions @xmath15 \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ \\varphi",
    "_ { a_{2 } } & = & xy(x^{2}-y^{2})\\exp \\left ( -a\\left [ x^{2}+y^{2}\\right ] \\right )   \\nonumber \\\\ \\varphi _ { b_{1 } } & = & ( x^{2}-y^{2})\\exp \\left ( -a\\left [ x^{2}+y^{2}\\right ] \\right )   \\nonumber \\\\ \\varphi _ { b_{2 } } & = & xy\\exp \\left ( -a\\left [ x^{2}+y^{2}\\right ] \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ \\varphi _ { e } & = & \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{c } x\\exp \\left ( -a\\left [ x^{2}+y^{2}\\right ] \\right ) \\\\",
    "y\\exp \\left ( -a\\left [ x^{2}+y^{2}\\right ] \\right ) \\end{array } \\right .",
    ".\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the reference function @xmath16 was not considered in the application of these methods to the pullen - edmonds hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : e_x2y2 ] shows results for the lowest eigenvalues obtained by the three methods outlined above .",
    "the rrho ones are the most accurate because they are based on basis sets of dimension @xmath17 .",
    "the rrk and cmx results were obtained with smaller basis sets because their purpose is merely to verify the rrho results .",
    "the cmx is the less reliable of the three methods as argued elsewhere@xcite but it is a suitable independent test because it is not based on the variational method .",
    "it is possible to improve the rrk and cmx results by choosing @xmath18 conveniently ; however , here we simply chose @xmath19 that is not optimal for all the states .",
    "figures [ fig : a ] , [ fig : b ] and [ fig : e ] show contour lines for some of the states of the anharmonic oscillator obtained by means of the rrho .",
    "the two variational methods appear to converge rather slowly but smoothly from above as expected for such approaches .",
    "numerical instabilities appeared for the greatest rrho matrices and we estimated the eigenvalues from the best results that satisfied the well known variational inequality @xmath20 .",
    "the cmx does not give upper bounds but it approached the variational results satisfactorily .",
    "no anomalous behaviour was detected that could suggest that the spectrum is not discrete .",
    "therefore , present numerical results support the mathematical proofs given by simon@xcite and stand against the claim raised by bender et al@xcite .",
