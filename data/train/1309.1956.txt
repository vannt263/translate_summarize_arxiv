    "laminar and turbulent flow of superfluid @xmath10he around an oscillating microsphere ( radius @xmath11 = 0.12 mm ) has been studied in detail since 1995 @xcite . at small oscillation amplitudes the drag force is linear in velocity amplitude ( stokes regime ) and is determined by the normal fluid component . at temperatures below ca . 0.5",
    "k the linear drag is given solely by ballistic phonon scattering and vanishes as @xmath12 . above a critical velocity amplitude @xmath13 @xcite a transition to a large and nonlinear drag force is observed that scales as @xmath14 , see fig.1 .",

    "15% correction due to the principle of energy balance is needed @xcite . ) from a fit to the data we find that @xmath15 is given by the classical value @xcite @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the density of the superfluid and the coefficient @xmath18 = 0.36 is in agreement with what is known from spheres in fully developed classical turbulence .",
    "it is remarkable that for oscillating turbulent superflow we find @xmath19 to be identical to the value for classical turbulent dc flow .",
    "the shift of the drag force by @xmath20 is the signature of the superfluid : at @xmath21 = 0 an infinitesimal driving force will lead to the critical velocity @xmath4 .",
    "this transition is obviously the onset of turbulent flow . for velocities within a few percent above @xmath4 an instability of the flow",
    "is observed at temperatures below ca .",
    "0.5 k , namely an intermittent switching of the flow pattern between turbulent and laminar phases @xcite , see fig.2 where three time series are shown that were recorded at a constant temperature of 300 mk and at different driving forces . during a turbulent phase",
    "the drag is given by the large turbulent drag force and , hence , the velocity amplitude is low .",
    "when turbulence breaks down the velocity amplitude begins to grow due to the much smaller phonon drag . because the velocity amplitudes are above @xmath4 these phases of laminar flow ( better : potential flow ) break down and a new turbulent phase is observed .",
    "it is obvious that the lifetimes of the turbulent phases grow very rapidly with the driving force . in the following",

    "_ appears _ to be stable . in our earlier work",
    ", this switching behavior has been discussed in some detail @xcite . in this work ,",
    "a new and more detailed and more quantitative analysis of the mean turbulent lifetimes is presented . in particular , the  characteristic \" force @xmath7 is identified : it will be shown that it is due to the shedding of vortex rings of the same size @xmath11 as the oscillating sphere .",
    "this is a very plausible result , of course , but - to our knowledge - has not been derived quantitatively before .",
    "instabilities of the flow and switching phenomena due to emission of vortex rings have been reported with vibrating wires in superfluid @xmath10he @xcite and @xmath26he @xcite but no quantitative analysis of the turbulent drag force has been possible .",
    "also , it should be mentioned that vortex shedding from a spherical pendulum in water has been observed and beautiful pictures of vortex rings are presented @xcite . because of the viscosity of water and , hence , because of the existence of a viscous boundary layer on the sphere the analysis of the freely decaying pendulum oscillations is quite different from our analysis of the transient turbulence .",
    "+ our results for the mean turbulent lifetimes are displayed in fig.3 .",
    "we obtain for the 119 hz oscillator @xmath28 = 0.5 s and @xmath7 = 18 pn , while for the 160 hz oscillator we have @xmath28 = 0.25 s and @xmath7 = 20 pn .",
    "although we have data only for two frequencies it appears that @xmath7 scales as @xmath31 because @xmath32 = 1.16 and 20/18 = 1.11 . in the following",
    "we will first concentrate on the properties of @xmath7 by using dimensional arguments .",
    "in addition to its frequency dependence the force @xmath7 must be given by a product of the density of liquid helium @xmath33 kg / m@xmath26 , a length scale which we take as the radius @xmath34 mm of the sphere , and the circulation quantum @xmath35 m@xmath36/s .",
    "+   + the result is @xmath37 .",
    "the latter expression is more appropriate because @xmath38 determines the critical velocity , see above . of course",
    ", we must allow for a numerical factor @xmath39 which can be obtained only from the experiment :    @xmath40    from our experimental results for @xmath7 we find @xmath41 .",
    "what is the origin of @xmath7 ?",
    "we propose that a vortex ring of the size @xmath11 is shed by the sphere during each half - period @xmath42 .",
    "the power lost by the sphere amounts to the energy @xmath43 of the ring per half - period .",
    "for @xmath43 we take the usual formula , namely @xcite @xmath44.\\ ] ] the term in the brackets is roughly 14 .",
    "the dissipated power is then given by +    @xmath45 , +    i.e. , @xmath46 this result agrees with ( 2 ) and with our experiment : @xmath7 scales as @xmath47 and is independent of temperature , the numerical factor of 1.6 is close to our experimental value of 1.3 .",
    "we interpret the number @xmath48as the average number of vortex rings emitted per half - period .",
    "our data in fig.3 lie in the range @xmath49 .",
    "the drag force determines the velocity amplitude of the sphere : @xmath50 .",
    "we write @xmath51 where @xmath52 and the  characteristic \" velocity is @xmath53 = 0.34 mm / s , and is independent of any other quantity .",
    "we note that @xmath54 is of the same order of magnitude as the self - induced velocity of a vortex ring of size @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "+ we can assign now to any velocity coordinate of @xmath24 both the number @xmath55 of vortex rings that are shed per half - period and the lifetime @xmath56 .",
    "for example , for @xmath57 = 0.05 we find @xmath55 = 3.65 and @xmath58 s ( for the 119 hz oscillator ) , while for @xmath57 = 0.1 we have @xmath55 = 7.48 and @xmath59 s , which is much longer than the lifetime of the universe . from ( 5 ) also follows that the drag force can now be written as @xmath60 .",
    "+ for very small values of @xmath61 , i.e. , in the regime where we observe the intermittent switching , we may neglect the term @xmath62 in ( 5 ) and simply use @xmath63 , i.e. , we can plot the normalized lifetimes @xmath64,\\ ] ] see fig.4 .",
    "note the very rapid growth of @xmath65 in a very small interval of velocities ( @xmath66 above @xmath4 ) and the frequency independence of the data .",
    "+ from fig.3 the prefactors @xmath28 can not be determined as accurately as the forces @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , since we have data only for two oscillation frequencies , the frequency dependence of @xmath28 remains unclear at present , see below .     as a function of @xmath52 for the 119 hz oscillator at 301 mk ( blue squares ) and the 160 hz oscillator at 30 mk with 0.05% @xmath26he ( black dots ) .",
    "note the rapid increase of @xmath67 by almost 3 orders of magnitude over the small velocity interval of ca .",
    "0.5 mm / s and the frequency independence of the data.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "the exponential dependence of @xmath5 on @xmath68 may be described by rice s formula @xcite for gaussian fluctuations crossing a given level .",
    "it is applied here to fluctuations of @xmath9 crossing @xmath4 where turbulence breaks down .",
    "the average number per unit time of crossings of a given level @xmath69 below a mean at zero with negative slope is proportional to @xmath70 with @xmath71 being the variance of the fluctuations . postulating that the lifetime of a turbulent phase is ending at the first crossing of @xmath9 of level @xmath4 @xcite , we obtain ( 6 ) .",
    "@xmath72 is interpreted to be twice the average time between two crossings of the level @xmath4 @xcite , i.e. , for @xmath28 = 0.5 s or 0.25 s there are 4 or 8 crossings per second which means that the velocity of the sphere fluctuates at an average frequency of 2 hz or 4 hz , respectively .",
    "this could not be detected with our electronics .",
    "based on a quantitative analysis of the measured lifetimes of the turbulent flow around the oscillating sphere we have achieved a more detailed understanding of what causes the turbulent drag on the sphere .",
    "our model of vortex shedding from the sphere is plausible and describes quantitatively our experimental results on the transition to quantum turbulence . in our earlier work",
    "@xcite we had inferred the vortex line density from the velocity amplitude by making use of results based on dc vortex dynamics . as long as a theory of oscillating turbulent superflow is not available , these assumptions are not yet proven to be valid .",
    "in contrast , in our present work we are discussing only the forces @xmath3 and the resulting velocity amplitudes @xmath73 and , therefore , avoiding those uncertainties .",
    "+   + finally , we emphasize again ( as done already earlier @xcite ) : when the rapidly growing lifetimes of the turbulent phases begin to exceed the time of observation , driven superfluid turbulence _ appears to be stable _ , which is misleading because the lifetimes are _ large but finite and do not diverge_. a similar result has been found in turbulent classical pipe flow @xcite ."
