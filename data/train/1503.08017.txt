    "the simplest type of hybridization is the presence of a single two - level atom in the optomechanical cavity .",
    "both internal and motional degrees of freedom of the atom can be coupled to the motion of the mo .",
    "the presence of an atom in the optomechanical cavity can increase the strength of the coupling between the optical and the mechanical degrees of freedom . in this manner , the quantum behavior in an oms can be observed and controlled more efficiently .",

    "the nonlinear character of the oms plays an important role in our treatment .",
    "the system under consideration is a hybrid system formed by a single two - level atom which is trapped in a multimode fabry - perot cavity with a vibrating end mirror .",
    "we assume that the internal states of the atom are indirectly coupled to the mo vibrations via the common interaction with the cavity field .",
    "the system is affected by various dissipation mechanisms .",
    "separating time scales of dissipations allows us to generate the scss for time scales much larger than the atomic characteristic time and smaller than the mo characteristic time of decay .",

    "these states are highly nonclassical , i.e. , they show quadrature squeezing and they have wigner function with negative values in some regions .",
    "the curvature of the sphere is determined by the intensities of the optical fields as well as the coupling strength of atom - fields , which can be controlled experimentally .",

    "<S> a theoretical scheme for the realization of the sphere - coherent motional states in an optomechanical cavity in the presence of a two - level atom is proposed . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , the analogy between an atom - assisted optomechanical cavity and a laser - driven trapped - ion system is used . </S>",
    "<S> this analogy provides us with a theoretical tool to show how sphere - coherent states can be generated for the motional degree of freedom of the macroscopic mechanical oscillator from atom - field - mirror interactions in a multi - mode optomechanical cavity . </S>",
    "<S> some nonclassical properties of the generated state of the mechanical oscillator , including the degree of quadrature squeezing and the negativity of the wigner distribution are studied . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the effects of the dissipation mechanisms involved in the system under consideration , including the atomic spontaneous emission and the damping of the motion of the mechanical oscillator , on the generated motional sphere - coherent states . </S>"
