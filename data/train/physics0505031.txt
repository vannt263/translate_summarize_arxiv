    "corruption seems to be an unavoidable part of human social interaction , prevalent in every society at any time since the very beginning of human history till today . in sharp contrast to the high prevalence of corruption in many countries and the rather large literature on political , social and economical aspects of corruption",
    "there is only a small number of attempts to model the dynamics of corruption in a mathematically quantified way .",
    "the modelling approach in these few attempts essentially follows two paths .",
    "the first is in the sense of microeconomics and incorporates game theoretic aspects ( for a recent model in this direction see the book by steinrcken @xcite and the references therein ) or rules for maximizing a certain economically based profit functional ( @xcite@xcite )",
    ". then a set of differential equations for the evolution of the mean corruption is derived and a stability analysis done on that basis . in these models",
    "one usually makes rather detailed assumptions about the underlying organization structure on which the individuals interact .",
    "the second line of approach is more in the sense of cellular automata ( ca ) models with rather simple state variables and local interaction dynamics .",
    "for example in the article by wirl @xcite a simple 1-dimensional deterministic cellular lattice automata model is used to describe the propagation of corruption . nevertheless , as is well known in ca - modelling , the global dynamical picture can be highly complex and nontrivial .",
    "up to now all these attempts did not take into account the complex network of social relationships as the underlying structure for the spread of corruption . in this article we will present a model for the spread of corruption on complex networks in the spirit of epidemiology .",
    "the model describes aspects of the evolution of corruption in a virtual population and incorporates some basic universal features of corruption .",
    "the local interaction dynamics of the model is similar to cellular automata but `` lives '' not on a lattice type graph like most of the ca - models but on complex networks .    considering corruption as a nonstandard epidemic process relies on the plausible assumption that corruption rarely emerges out of nothing but is usually related to some already corrupt environment which may `` infect '' susceptibles",
    "of course the spontaneous decision of somebody to act corruptly is possible and could easy be handled in the model as an external weak source of infection .",
    "one of the very special features in corruption propagation which differs from what is used in describing classical epidemic processes is the threshold like dependence of the local transition probabilities . by this",
    "we mean that a noncorrupt individual gets infected with high probability if the number of corrupt individuals in the group of his direct social contacts ( encoded as the set of neighbors in a `` friendship '' or acquaintance graph ) exceeds a certain threshold number .",
    "otherwise if the number of corrupt individuals in somebodies social neighborhood is below that threshold value there is only a small probability to get corrupt via such `` local '' interactions .",
    "the second main difference to classical epidemic processes is the mean field dependence of the corruption process . by this",
    "we mean that an individual can get corrupt just because there is a high prevalence ( or believed prevalence ) in the society even when there is no corruption in the local neighborhood .",
    "there is another interesting mean field term entering the game , namely the society strikes back to corruption with an efficiency proportional to the fraction of the noncorrupt people",
    ". both mean field terms are nonlinear and together with the local propagation mechanisms they give rise to a rather complex dynamical picture .",
    "corruption is a substructure of human social interaction .",
    "common sense associates corruption mainly with a deviation from fair play interaction in the development of social relations .",
    "clearly what is meant be fair play depends on the cultural context of a given population / society .",
    "this vague description of corruption is in the spirit of sociology and psychology and differs from the more narrow corruption concepts usually considered in economics or political sciences .",
    "there , corruption is mainly seen as a misuse of public power to gain profit in a more or less illegal way . in any case",
    ", corruption has many different faces in its concrete appearance and no single model approach will be able to describe the whole picture in an adequate way .",
    "but this does not at all imply that mathematical models are useless in this situation .",
    "they can provide a substantial improvement in our understanding of corruption as long as one clearly defines the aim and limitations of the taken approach .    for the model approach developed in this article we will use the notion of corruption in the more general , first sense .",
    "more precisely our intention is to describe changes in mind ranging from damming of corruption as a criminal act to accepting corruption as an attractive option .",
    "therefore in this paper we do not introduce the group of state representatives or officials since we assume that the essential changes in mind which allow corrupt acts happen long before an individual is in the position to act corruptly .",
    "empirical investigations about motives and `` typology '' of corrupt actors ( see @xcite for results from case studies in germany ) have shown that the majority of individuals involved in corruption affairs are highly educated , well positioned with respect to social status and do not think to have done something wrong , indicating the importance of mind changes prior to corrupt acts .",
    "there is a notorious problem in finding good empirical data which would allow to estimate the prevalence of corruption .",
    "probably the greatest effort over the last years to measure the degree of corruption in various countries was made by `` transparency international '' ( ta ) , a non profit group of individuals and organizations which are highly concerned by the lack of sound data . since 1995",
    "they publish a yearly corruption report and a so called corruption perception index ( cpi ) @xcite .",
    "ta is well aware of the subjectivity in peoples perception of corruption but hopes that the large number of cases involved in the cpi averages out most of the bias .",
    "figure [ 62 ] gives a cpi - rank plot of the 2004 date from ta .",
    "note that a value of @xmath0 for the cpi corresponds to the absence of corruption . for 2004 finland holds the",
    "top ranking and germany is on place @xmath1 with an index of @xmath2 .",
    "[ ptb ]    corrpap1.eps    it is not our aim to explain the values of the cpi or other corruption data sets , since this would require a semirealistic modelling of the social and economical structure of individual countries which is completely illusionary at the present stage of research .",
    "rather we want to demonstrate which scenarios are dynamically possible and whether there are phase transitions .",
    "in this section we first describe the basic setting for our model structure .",
    "refinements and more detailed aspects will be discussed later on . due to the common view",
    ", corruption is first of all a property of the relations between individuals irrespectively which definition of corruption one uses . since an act of corruption requires that at least one of the participants in a corrupt relation has a mental state which tolerates or even assigns a positive value to ( his personal view of ) corruption we will focus mainly on the spread of this mental state change ( from not accepting to accepting corrupt acts as an option for one s own activities ) .",
    "therefore to discuss corruption as an epidemic process in the afore mentioned sense it is useful to assign a corruption property to the individuals themselves . in the simplest case",
    "we just have a time dependent @xmath3 state variable @xmath4 assigned to each individual , encoding whether the vertex is corrupt @xmath5 or not @xmath6 at time @xmath7 ( of course more refined scales for the degree of corruption are possible and will be discussed in a forthcoming paper ) .",
    "the underlying structure on which corruption spreads is a given finite graph @xmath8 from a random graph space @xmath9 with fixed vertex set @xmath10 furthermore we consider in this article only stationary graphs with no changes in time on the underlying graph structure ( the study of corruption on evolutionary graphs requires a paper in its own ) .",
    "the dynamics is specified by conditional transition probabilities @xmath11 which depend mainly on the states on @xmath12 and a meanfield term reflecting the influence of the total prevalence of corruption in the society . here",
    "@xmath13 is the usual graph metric on @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the degree of @xmath16 .",
    "we define @xmath17 as the density of corruption at time @xmath7 .",
    "the standing assumptions on @xmath11 are the following : @xmath18\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in other words the probability to become corrupt depends only on the local prevalence of corruption among the neighbors and the mean corruption in the society and individuals who became corrupt can cure from corruption with a rate proportional to the density of the noncorrupt individuals in the society . in classical i.i.d .",
    "epidemics one would have the following as functional dependence for the local part of the conditional probabilities : @xmath19 which is for small @xmath20 and @xmath21 proportional to @xmath22 for corruption the function @xmath23 is more like in voter models , that is below a critical value @xmath24 of the number of corrupt individuals in @xmath25 the value of @xmath23 is close to zero and above @xmath24 it is a number @xmath26 much larger then zero . due to this property local clustering can force the epidemics to spread whereas in classical epidemic processes high clustering slows down the spread of an infection due to reinfection of the already infected .",
    "we want to illustrate this by two simple examples .",
    "the simplest , almost trivial example is the @xmath27 lattice with additional edges to the next - nearest neighbors . setting @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath30",
    "it is easy to see that there is a nonzero probability for infecting all vertices starting with one infected individual at time @xmath31    the infection function @xmath23 will be the same as in example 1 .",
    "we start with a regular tree of degree 3 .",
    "replacing each vertex by a triangle and gluing the triangles along the former edges of the regular tree gives a regular graph of degree 4 where the triangle corners act now as the new vertices . in each neighbor pair of triangles @xmath32 ( that are the triangles which have a common vertex )",
    "we form an edge randomly between the set of vertices lying in @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( see fig .",
    "[ ptb ]    corrpap2.eps    once a triangle is infected the corruption jumps to all the three neighbor triangles due to the extra random edge present between each neighbor pairs of triangles .",
    "hence again we have a nonzero probability that the whole graph becomes infected .    in the above examples we have used a very simple and somehow extreme form of the infection function @xmath35 in the following we will investigate the situation for two canonical subclasses of infection functions .",
    "we say that @xmath23 is a vertex independent , fixed threshold infection function if there is a @xmath36 such that @xmath37 for @xmath38 and @xmath39 for @xmath40 for the second class of functions we assume the threshold to be degree dependent .",
    "namely we call @xmath41 a vertex dependent , relative threshold function if for some @xmath42 we have @xmath43 for @xmath44 and @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore we say that @xmath23 is a voter - type infection function if @xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "in this paper we will mainly investigate the spread of corruption for the fixed threshold case .    to distinguish between the different ways in which an individual can become corrupt we will speak about the @xmath51 or @xmath52 process . for convenience of the reader",
    "we give in tabular 1 a summary of the different processes .",
    "note that in contrast to standard voter models we do not have the possibility of a locally induced backflip from the corrupt state to the noncorrupt .",
    "a kind of quenched disorder could easily be introduced by randomizing the relevant parameters individually but this will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "generalizations of classical epidemic dynamics to processes with a local threshold have recently also been studied in the context of models of contagion ( see @xcite and references therein ) but not yet been mixed with global mean field processes .",
    "in the last 10 years there has been an enormous progress in understanding the fine structure of social networks .",
    "this is mostly due to the availability of large data sets for some special social networks like e - mail correspondence , coauthorship network in scientific publications and movie actor networks to name just a few prominent examples .",
    "all these networks of social relations share three remarkable properties of the associated graph which are : 1 ) the diameter scales at most logarithmically in size 2 ) the graphs have a very high , asymptotically non - vanishing clustering coefficient- in other words the graphs are locally far from being tree - like 3 ) the degree distribution follows a power law ( scale - free graphs ) . properties 2 and 3 have striking consequences for the spread of corruption as will be discussed later on .",
    "there exists meanwhile a large collection of algorithms to generate complex networks with the above mentioned properties .    a widely used quantity to measure",
    "the local clustering is the triangle number @xmath53 and it s averaged value @xmath54 .",
    "a natural generalization is the @xmath55 clique number @xmath56 defined as the number of complete graphs of order @xmath21 containing @xmath57 in social network graphs @xmath58 is usually proportional to @xmath15 and @xmath54 becomes independent of the population size for large @xmath59 and stays bounded away from zero .",
    "another very remarkable property of real networks is the power - law distribution for the degree . by an asymptotic power - law distribution for a discrete random variable @xmath60",
    "we denote every functional behavior of the form @xmath61 with exponent @xmath62 most real networks have exponents between 2 and 4 ( see @xcite for an excellent overview ) .",
    "classical epidemic processes on such graphs have been studied by many authors , and perhaps the most astonishing result in this context is the absence of an epidemic threshold in case the exponent is below @xmath63 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this phenomenon is related to the existence of a massive center of size independent diameter induced by the high number of hubs ( vertices with an exceptional large degree ) .",
    "hubs play also a significant role for @xmath64 - process as will be explained in the next section .",
    "one of the main differences between corruption epidemics and classical epidemics is the different effect of clustering on the epidemic threshold and the total number of infected individuals . in the classical situation any epidemics",
    "will be slowed down by the presence of local cycles due to the high probability of reinfection . in corruption epidemics",
    "local clustering may speed up the propagation of corruption due to the nonlinear dependence of the infection probability on the number of infected neighbors as was already demonstrated in example 1 in the previous section . in the next section we will give two further examples where the strength of this effect can explicitly be computed .",
    "in this section we want to look at some threshold properties associated to the @xmath65 process .",
    "we are still far from a good understanding of the quantitative picture of this kind of processes for a given type of graph , which is mainly a consequence of our lack of knowledge how to handle graphs with high local clustering in a mathematical satisfactory way . in this section",
    "we want to state just some general observations and numerical results concerning the spread of threshold - like dynamics .",
    "furthermore we will analyze two examples of tree - like graphs which might serve as an illustration .",
    "a more careful mathematical analysis of @xmath65 processes requires a paper in its own .",
    "one of the remarkable differences between a classical epidemic process and a process based on local threshold dynamics is the dependence on the initial number of `` infected '' vertices in the latter case .",
    "classical epidemics does not know such things- either an epidemic process is overcritical ( reproduction number @xmath66 ) and a single initial infected vertex infects with with positive probability a positive fraction of the whole population , or the process is below criticality ( @xmath67 ) and all infected will die out respectively become healthy . in corruption epidemics",
    "both parts - the mean field process as well the local @xmath65 process - can have phase transitions with respect to the initial number of corrupt vertices .",
    "that means , there is critical initial density of corrupt vertices @xmath68 such that for initial densities below @xmath68 the number of infected stays as it is or goes down to zero . above @xmath68",
    "the entire population becomes corrupt with high probability . as an illustration we give in fig .",

    "[ ptb ]    corrpap3.eps    although in this paper we mainly concentrate on the case of absolute threshold values @xmath36 we give for comparison in fig.[55 ] the edge density dependence result for a relative , degree dependent threshold @xmath72 .",
    "there is still a critical density but its value increases with the edge density since the mean threshold increases now proportional to the mean degree .",
    "[ ptb ]    corrpap4.eps    as already mentioned in section 3 one expects that the presence of clustering ( respectively many triangles ) decreases the critical density @xmath68 since the @xmath64- process can propagate more easily . in fig .",
    "[ 99 ] the effect of the increase of the triangle number is clearly to see .",
    "here we used a modified @xmath70 random graph space where randomly triangles are added ( keeping the total number of edges constant ) .",
    "the threshold value @xmath36 was chosen to be @xmath73 since for higher @xmath36 one has to add higher order complete subgraphs instead of triangles .",
    "[ ptbptb ]    corrpap5.eps    the next figure ( fig .",
    "[ 300 ] ) shows the dependence of the critical density on @xmath74 the two curves represent the threshold values for an end - prevalence of @xmath0 respectively @xmath75 percent .",
    "since the mean degree in this simulation is about @xmath76 one has a vanishing contribution of the @xmath64- process above @xmath77 .",
    "the critical threshold @xmath68 stays than essentially at a value given by the mean field process ( see next section for details ) .",
    "[ ptb ]    to get an impression of the contribution of the different kind of processes ( local @xmath64 and @xmath20 , global @xmath78 and @xmath79 - for details see next section ) to the end - prevalence we give in fig .",

    "[ ptbptb ]    corrpap7.eps    we turn now to a more theoretical consideration , namely which type of vertices ( type in the sense of degree and local clustering ) are especially well suited for the propagation of corruption via the @xmath65process .",
    "assume we have given a random scale free graph space @xmath9 with @xmath59 vertices .",
    "we further assume that there are two types of edges ( according to the way they where generated ) the independent ones , generated at random with just preferences to the degree ( like the preferential attachment rule by albert&barabasi or the `` cameo - principle '' in @xcite ) and local ones which are relevant for the creation of triangles .",

    "@xmath96 the power in the @xmath55dependence gets negative and hence the high degree vertices contribute almost nothing to the clique - clustering .",
    "of course all this consideration rely on the assumption of some kind of independence in the triangle - formation process . in any case",
    "this results indicate that highly clustered medium degree vertices are especially well suited for the spread of corruption .",
    "a similar kind of analysis can be carried out for random graph models which have an intrinsic high probability to generate local cliques e.g. intersection graphs ( for an introduction to random intersection graphs and comparison with erds - renyi random graphs see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the above arguments seem to support the conjecture that in corruption epidemics the vertices from the tail of the degree distribution play a less dominant role .",
    "this is indeed true in the case of a relative , degree - dependent threshold where hubs are much more difficult to infect than medium or low degree vertices . for absolute thresholds in the @xmath64- process",
    "the situation is more complex since for scale free degree distributions with small exponents ( @xmath97 ) there are other mechanisms than local clustering which can cause a radical dropdown of the critical initial density . in fig.[56 ] and fig.[57 ] we give numerical results for the relation between the critical density @xmath68 and the exponent @xmath98 keeping the edge density fixed .",
    "there is a clear phase transition around @xmath99 for @xmath100 and @xmath101 for @xmath102 .",
    "[ ptb ]    corrpap8.eps    [ ptbptb ]    corrpap9.eps    the explanation of this observation is closely related to a structural phase transition in scale free random graphs at @xmath103 - namely that for most vertices @xmath16 an asymptotically positive fraction of all vertices has bounded distance to @xmath16 . to link this property with the @xmath64 - process one has to look more closely on the degree - degree correlation in scale - free graphs . depending on the choice of the model one can have very different correlations like:@xmath104 .",
    "formula [ 111 ] holds for instance for the cameo - model ( @xcite ) whereas formula [ 113 ] is valid for scale - free graphs generated via the molloy&reed algorithm ( the later one represents the random graph space containing all graphs with a given scale - free degree distribution equipped with the uniform measure and was used for the simulations in fig.[56 ] and [ 57 ] ) .",
    "evolutionary graphs like the albert&barabasi model have usually asymmetric and more complicated correlations .",
    "since a detailed analysis of the @xmath64 - process for scale - free graphs is beyond the scope of this paper we just give a heuristic outline why in graphs with a correlation as in formula [ 113 ] the threshold density @xmath68 tends to zero as @xmath105 for exponents @xmath97 .",
    "for fixed @xmath106 and @xmath107 ( note that the typical maximal degree is about @xmath108 it is obvious that vertices @xmath16 with @xmath109 get almost surely infected ( as @xmath105 ) via the @xmath64 - process as soon as @xmath110 .",

    "the mechanism described requires @xmath59 to be large and therefore we conjecture that the difference to the numerical results depicted in fig.[56 ] ( phase transition at @xmath121 instead of @xmath63 ) is due to finite size effects . in the case of @xmath102 ( fig.[57 ] )",
    "the finite size effects are smaller and the phase transition is closer to @xmath63 .",
    "a similar kind of arguments shows , that the expected path - length is finite for @xmath97 .",

    "we give without proof the formula for the computation of the critical probability in case of a rooted random tree with arbitrary outdegree distribution .",
    "let @xmath171 be the generating function for the outdegree ; that is @xmath172 is the probability that a random chosen vertex has outdegree @xmath173 ( and hence total degree @xmath174 ) .",
    "the critical probability @xmath147 is given by the smallest @xmath145 such that the equation @xmath175 has a positive real solution .",
    "a careful reader may have noticed that there is a big structural difference between the generalized tree in example 2 of section 3 and the generalized tree just discussed above .",
    "namely the graph of the first example has the property , that any two vertices can be linked by a chain of triangle where neighbor triangles always have a common edge .",
    "the graphs in the examples of this section do not have this property since neighboring triangles have only a common vertex . for threshold values",
    "@xmath176 one has to consider chains of @xmath177 cliques .",
    "we say that a graph is well @xmath21 -linked if any pair of vertices can be linked by a chain of complete graphs of order @xmath21 such that all neighboring @xmath55 cliques have a @xmath178- clique in common . for well @xmath21- linked graphs the critical density @xmath179 is zero ( a finite number of initially infected vertices",
    "can already infected a positive fraction of the vertex set ) for @xmath65processes with @xmath180 whereas for graphs which are not well linked one needs a positive critical density .",
    "the above study on trees or generalized trees is insofar important as in most random graph models used for complex networks one has as a tree or generalized tree as the typical local structure around a random chosen vertex .",
    "furthermore the dependence of the corruption dynamics on graph properties like edge density or degree distribution is in large parts of the parameter space entirely caused by the @xmath65 process .",
    "in this section we want to have a closer look at the mean field dependence of the corruption process . to gain some insight in the possible type of behavior we start with some simple assumptions which will be refined later on .",
    "again we will argue in a discrete time model but the transition to continuos time makes no problem and gives the same results .",
    "let @xmath182 the density of corrupt people at time @xmath183 we assume that the affinity for an individual to change its behavior from noncorrupt to corrupt increases proportional to the corruption prevalence .",

    "formally this reads as @xmath185 with @xmath186 $ ] .",
    "corrupt individuals can recover due to state and police effects ( uncovering , fear etc . ) .",
    "again it seems reasonable to assume that the probability to recover is proportional to @xmath187 since only the noncorrupt part of a society is willing to fight corruption .",
    "formally we will assume that @xmath188 with @xmath189 $ ] .",
    "this gives @xmath190 with the two obvious fixed points @xmath154 and @xmath191 for @xmath78 @xmath192 there is a third intermediate fixed point @xmath193 an interesting phenomena happens for parameter pairs @xmath194 s.t .",
    "@xmath195 since under this conditions both fixed points at @xmath154 and @xmath117 are locally stable .",
    "hence there are two basins of attraction- one for @xmath154 and one for @xmath196 with @xmath197 as the boundary point .",
    "in other words , if the initial percentage of corruption is less @xmath197 corruption stays under control whereas for an initial value larger @xmath197 things run out of control and a corruption collapse takes place .",
    "of course this mean field part of the model is still very simplistic and one should not expect any quantitative fit with empirical data .",
    "but the qualitative statement seems to be quite stable with respect to modifications .",
    "for instance there are good reasons to believe that neither the mean field infection nor the mean field recover process are linear in @xmath198    we want to end this section with a small modification of the mean field `` ansatz '' where we include social weights .",
    "this is a natural and meanwhile very common approach in network dynamics and can easily be adopted to the corruption model . in the above argumentation on the attraction of becoming corrupt it is plausible to assume that corrupt individuals with high social influence have a stronger influence on the mean field probability to get corrupt than individuals with low social importance .",
    "a similar argument holds for the recover probability . as a simple measure for social strength we use the degree of the vertices since high degree vertices are more likely to play a dominant social role than low degree vertices .",
    "formally we introduce the weighted density @xmath199at time @xmath7 as @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the number of vertices with degree @xmath21 and @xmath202 the number of corrupt ( state @xmath117 ) vertices with degree @xmath21 at time @xmath7 . the mean field equation for group @xmath21",
    "is now given by@xmath203 .",
    "multiplying the last equation by @xmath204 and summing over @xmath21 gives @xmath205 which is the same as equation ( [ 100 ] ) .",
    "therefore the introduction of social weights does not add anything new to the dynamical picture .",
    "there is of course a difference in the interpretation since a small real initial prevalence of corruption can give rise to a high initial value of @xmath206 as soon as the corruption is concentrated at the high degree vertices . here",
    "also a difference between scale free networks and classical random networks is seen since in the scale free case high degree vertices ( hubs ) are much more frequent than in the classical case .",
    "in this paragraph we will investigate some aspects of the interplay between the mean field process described in the previous section and the local , threshold dependent , corruption propagation .",
    "for @xmath208 there is a core infected component generated via the @xmath65 process . to gain some insight how such a core infected part of the population changes the mean field dynamics",
    "we will assume that a certain fraction , say @xmath209 of the population is permanently infected and resistant to the @xmath52deletion process .",
    "denoting by @xmath210 the density in the noncore part of the population ( the normalization here is still with respect to the total population size ) we get the following mean field dynamics:@xmath211 . since the state where all individuals are infected is stationary we get the following set of fixed points:@xmath212 . for @xmath213",
    "there are no real fixed points except @xmath214 which becomes globally stable under this condition .",

    "furthermore in this case also the fixed point at @xmath217 becomes a local attractor .",
    "this is for instance the case when @xmath218 becomes very small and @xmath219 - being back essentially in the situation of the previous section . in case",
    "when @xmath220 it is easy to show that the fixed point at @xmath221 becomes a global attractor ( to see this just note that the derivative at @xmath222 is always positive for the relevant parameter intervals ) .",

    "one is always in the basin of attraction of zero for @xmath225 sufficiently small and @xmath226 ( in other words @xmath227 is never a global attractor ) one can now have the phenomenon that only the complete saturation with corruption is stable ( @xmath228 ) . as an example lets look at the case where @xmath229 . for @xmath223",
    "there is a fixed point at @xmath230 and hence for an initial infection density @xmath231 the pure mean field dynamics converges to zero . in the case @xmath232 one",
    "has for @xmath233 only the stable fixed point @xmath234 at @xmath235 there is a phase transition since a new indifferent ( slope 1 ) fixed point at @xmath236 emerges . for @xmath237 this fixed point bifurcates into two fixed points where the first one at @xmath238 becomes locally stable with a basin of attraction given by @xmath239 @xmath240    we close this section by presenting a numerical result showing the different contributions to the overall infection ( end - prevalence ) of the local and mean field processes as a function of the edge density in the random graph space @xmath241 .",

    "it is surprising that the system semi - stabilizes after an initial rapid increase in the prevalence for a rather long time ( fig.[6 ] ) . to a certain extend the results",
    "can be explained along the argumentation in section 7 . in fig.[800 ] the accumulated infection processes for the initial phase are shown . here the @xmath20- process , although undercritical , causes a redistribution of infection till a clustered configuration is reached such that the @xmath64- process can start .",
    "than the systems stays in almost complete balance till the @xmath181 process ( which is slow in all our examples ) wins ( fig.[801 ] ) .",
    "note the difference to fig.[4 ] , where the @xmath181 process never really contributes to the infection .",
    "finally we show two simulations for a sample of a random set graph model with about 1000 vertices ( fig.[20 ] and fig.[21 ] ) .",
    "although both prevalence curves look similar there is a clear difference in the process fine - structure ( fig.[22 ] and fig.[23 ] ) .",
    "in the first instance the @xmath244 and @xmath181 process are causing the collapse whereas in the second case the @xmath65 process in conjunction with the @xmath244 process is the main booster .",
    "the few examples of single simulation runs given in this section show already , that there are many different routes to obtain high prevalence in corruption typically interrupted by long phases of metastability .",
    "similar to other complex systems with hidden phase transitions ( e.g. the climate ) there can be an unnoticed small accumulation of infection till a critical density- a point of no return- of corruption is reached from which on an almost complete saturation of the society ( or a corresponding subsystem ) by corruption becomes the normality .",
    "one of the basic question in classical epidemics as well as in corruption dynamics is : what can be done to slow down the `` infection '' propagation or prevalence . knowing the different phase transitions and their dependency on structure properties and social parameters is of great help in designing proper prevention scenarios . in the following",
    "we will try to relate some of the findings from our model to what is considered by practicians as useful in corruption reduction .",
    "first we would like to emphasize again that the present model deals in a rather abstract way with the propagation of mental willingness to be corrupt and not so much with realized corruption which always requires a specific environment and additional structural assumptions . hence concerning corruption control",
    ", we only will be able to support certain prevention scenarios in the sense , that they go into the right direction and that there effect is strong or weak but without being able to make quantitative statements .",
    "the model presented in this paper contains , besides structural parameters for the underlying network , @xmath134 relevant parameters : @xmath64- characterizing the strength of the local threshold process , @xmath78- characterizing the strength of the mean field attraction on becoming corrupt , @xmath79- the strength of the `` society strikes back '' term , @xmath20- the strength of the classical epidemic process ( assumed to be very small ) and @xmath36- the height of the local threshold .",
    "three of the parameters- @xmath277 and @xmath20- are positively correlated to the spread of corruption whereas @xmath73 parameters- @xmath36 and @xmath79- are negatively correlated .",
    "as is well known from classical epidemic control for infectious diseases it is very hard if not impossible to change basic social parameters in a short time .",
    "this can only be achieved in a long running educational process .",
    "therefore not much can be done in avoiding high clustering in certain relevant areas of the society in order to prevent the emergence of highly connected corruption nets .",
    "as the name already indicates , transparency international favours as an effective tool to decrease corruption especially the increase of transparency in all forms of administrative decision making as well as transparency in financial affairs of socially exposed persons , institutions and companies .",
    "the effect of an increase of transparency translates into our model as an increase of the value of @xmath36 and a decrease of the values of @xmath278 and @xmath20 .",
    "strengthening of justice , police and similar instruments to fight and uncover corruption has again the effect of lowering @xmath78 ( via increase of fear ) but may also increase the value of @xmath79 ( uncovering rate ) . since an increase of @xmath79 above the value of @xmath78 and @xmath64 would perhaps require a total police state",
    ", it is illusionary to overcome corruption just by means of law , justice and police .",
    "besides necessary long term educational efforts in school and public to strengthen the moral resistance against corruption ( increase of @xmath36 and decrease of @xmath64 ) it seems a good strategy to make administrative and political decision hierarchies as independent and decentralized as possible to avoid high clustering .",
    "we would like to end these short remarks by a few comments on the role of hubs - the very high degree vertices typically present in scale free graphs - in corruption dynamics .",
    "while a priori not especially well suited to transmit corruption via the @xmath65 process due to the local tree like structure around the hubs ( compared with low degree vertices ) they nevertheless are more often exposed to corruption and have therefore a higher probability to get corrupt .",
    "if the hub density is sufficiently high ( as is the case for scale - free degree distributions with exponent @xmath97 ) and the degree correlation is stronger than additive many vertices are linked to the hubs via social dependencies and in turn also can get corrupt .",
    "furthermore they may play a fatal role in increasing the weighted corruption density relevant for the mean field process as was explained at the end of section 7 .",
    "the described situation is probably typical for strongly hierarchically organized countries or regional substructures e.g. systems with a dictatorial or monarchical tendency . in such societies",
    "a high prevalence of corruption seems almost unavoidable since the threshold @xmath68 is close to zero . for democratic societies",
    "it seems therefore wise , to watch the behavior of hubs- whatever their social interpretation might be- more intensively than the `` normal '' part of the society .",
    "in this article we have presented a first study of the spread of corruption on scale free and highly clustered networks .",
    "one of the main observations so far is the strong dependence of the asymptotic dynamics on the initial number of corrupt individuals .",
    "this holds as well for the mean field process as for the local dynamics .",
    "second there is a fatal resonance effect between global and local dynamics lowering dramatically the critical density of initial infection .",
    "as expected there is a positive correlation between clustering and spread of corruption respectively the critical initial density .",
    "scale - freenes seems to play an important role for the corruption process for distributions with small exponent ( @xmath97 ) and multiplicative degree correlation due to the high prevalence of infected hubs and the strong linkage of medium and low degree vertices to them . for higher exponents the dynamics",
    "is rather insensitive to the degree distribution .",
    "the strength of the degree correlation ( from weak - additive till strong - multiplicative or even higher powers ) in networks of social acquaintances seems to be related to the political and institutional structure of a society which favours liberal organization forms as being less vulnerable to corruption .",
    "there is a whole bunch of natural continuations or generalizations which have to be investigated next .",
    "clearly a deeper understanding of the pure @xmath65 process and its phase transitions is necessary .",
    "the mathematical problem is already highly nontrivial on trees .",
    "the following short list gives a selection of natural generalizations and refinements :                        besides the specific context of corruption dynamics there is a multitude of topics where the model presented in this paper could easily be adopted to .",
    "this includes so different themes as political opinion formation , social disorder processes , strategies for advertisement , doping usage , the spread of prejudices , migration dynamics , global terrorist networks and innovation processes . in all these examples",
    "one has a local and global dynamics very similar to the one described here .",
    "of course there are differences .",
    "for instance in many mind formation problems the state space of individuals is rather complex and the local dynamics allows for many transitions not just 0 - 1 as in the corruption model .",
    "furthermore aging phenomena and limits of resources could be included .",
    "but besides this addition of structure and complexity and the various interpretations there remains a good part of the findings of this work to be true .",
    "there will be phase transitions in the initial density of certain properties and there can be resonance effects between the nonlinear global and local dynamics - both making the prediction of future difficult and challenging",
