    "in this study we investigate whether present data from the cdf detector allow or preclude the production of a hypothetical new quark which decays to a final state with a high-@xmath3 lepton , large @xmath4 , and multiple hadronic jets having large total transverse energy @xmath5 thus mimicking top quark pair event signatures .",
    "we refer to the hypothetical new quark as @xmath0 for brevity , although such a signature could be a standard fourth - generation up - type heavy quark or any up - type quark .",
    "a number of theoretical models advocate a fourth chiral generation of massive fermions with the same quantum numbers as ordinary ones @xcite .",
    "precision measurements from lep exclude a light fourth neutrino @xmath6 with mass @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the mass of the @xmath9 boson .",
    "a fourth generation neutrino can not be too heavy due to sizeable radiative corections . despite this , reasonable constructions of a fourth generation exist that remain viable @xcite . in many theoretical models",
    "the addition of a fourth generation relaxes present bounds on the higgs .",
    "in addition frequently a small mass splitting between new heavy quarks @xmath0 and @xmath10 is preferred , such that @xmath11 and @xmath0 decays predominantly to @xmath1 ( a @xmath12 boson and a down - type quark @xmath13 ) @xcite . for the purposes of this analysis we assume",
    "that the new quark is pair - produced strongly , has mass greater than the top quark , and decays promptly to @xmath1 final states .",
    "the data we use in the analysis corresponds to 2.8 fb@xmath2 of integrated luminosity collected at the fermilab tevatron in @xmath14 collisions at @xmath15 tev .",
    "the cdf ii detector is described in detail in ref .",
    "we can parameterize coordinates in the detector using the azimuthal angle @xmath16 and the pseudorapidity @xmath17 $ ] , where @xmath18 is the polar angle measured from the proton beam direction .",
    "the transverse energy @xmath19 is defined as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the energy deposited in a calorimeter cluster .",
    "the transverse momentum @xmath22 of a track is the component of the track momentum transverse to the beam - line .",
    "the missing transeverse energy @xmath4 is the magnitude of the vector defined as -@xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the transverse component of the unit vector pointing from the interaction point to the calorimeter tower @xmath25 .",
    "this is corected for the @xmath22 of muons , which do not deposit all of their energy in the calorimeter , and tracks which point to uninstrumented regions in the calorimeter .",
    "highly energetic quarks ( such as the down - type quark produced in the hypothesized @xmath0 decay ) undergo fragmentation that results in jets of hadronic particles .",
    "jet candidates are reconstructed using the calorimeter towers with corrections to improve the accuracy of the energy estimation and are required to have @xmath26 gev and @xmath27 .",
    "candidate events for this @xmath0 search are required to have exactly one isolated electron or muon with @xmath28 gev / c , @xmath29 gev , at least four jets with @xmath30 gev .    to reduce the contribution of the qcd background we also require a lead jet with @xmath31 gev and two cuts one in the @xmath32 between the corrected @xmath4 and the lepton vs @xmath4 plane ( requiring @xmath33 where @xmath34 = 4.408 ; @xmath35 = 6.11 ) and one in the @xmath32 between @xmath4 and lead jet vs @xmath4 plane ( requiring @xmath36 where @xmath37 = 1.888 ; @xmath38 = 21.6 ) .",
    "the dominant contributing backgrounds after this event selection are from electroweak process as well as @xmath39 pair production .",
    "electroweak processes are dominated by @xmath12 + jets . for the @xmath39 background we use monte carlo ( mc )",
    "generated using an assumed top quark mass of 175 gev .",
    "the qcd background is modeled using a sample of data where the lepton i d cuts have been reversed .",
    "other backgrounds ( including @xmath9+jets , @xmath40+jets , @xmath41+jets and single top events ) have a smaller rate than @xmath12 + jets and in addition have been found to have similar kinematic distributions to @xmath12 + jes and so are modeled as one background using the @xmath12 + jets model .",
    "we utilize the fact that in our regime of interest the @xmath0 decay chain is identical to that of the top quark to reconstruct the @xmath0 mass in the same way as is done in the top quark mass measurement analyses .",
    "we use the template method for top quark mass reconstruction @xcite based on the best @xmath42-fit to the kinematic properties of the final top ( or @xmath0 ) decay products .",
    "the @xmath43 is given by the following expression :    @xmath44    where the invariant masses of the @xmath12 decay products @xmath45 and @xmath46 are constrained to the pole mass of the @xmath12 boson , and the masses of top and anti - top ( @xmath0 and @xmath47 ) quarks are required to be same .",
    "the jet and lepton energies as well as the unclustered energy ( @xmath48 ) are allowed to float within their resolution uncertainties .",
    "the transverse component of the neutrino momentum is determined as the negative sum of the lepton , jet and unclustered transverse energies : @xmath49    for each event there are total 4!/2 = 12 combinations of assigning 4 jets to partons .",
    "in addition , there are two solutions to account for the unknown z - component of the neutrino momentum .",
    "after minimization of the @xmath43 expression , the combination with the lowest @xmath43 is selected and the value of @xmath50 is declared to be the reconstructed mass @xmath51 of top ( or @xmath0 ) .",
    "we use the observed distributions of the @xmath51 and total transverse energy in the event @xmath52 to distinguish the @xmath0 signal from the backgrounds by fitting it to a combination of @xmath0 signal , top , electroweak background , and qcd background shapes .",
    "we use a binned in @xmath53 and @xmath51 likelihood fit to extract the @xmath0 signal and/or set an upper limit on its production rate .",
    "we chose to use bins of 25 gev in both @xmath54 and @xmath55 with @xmath54 in 26 bins from 150 to 800 gev and @xmath55 in 16 bins from 100 to 500 gev .",
    "the likelihood is defined as the product of the poisson probabilities for observing @xmath56 events in 2d bin @xmath25 of ( @xmath57 ) : @xmath58    the expected number of events in each bin , @xmath59 , is given by the sum over all sources , indexed by @xmath60 @xmath61 here @xmath62 is the integrated luminosity , @xmath63 is the cross section , and @xmath64 is the efficiency per bin of ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "we calculate the likelihood as a function of the @xmath0 cross section , and use bayes theorem to convert it into a posterior density in @xmath65 .",
    "we can then use this posterior density to set an upper limit on ( or if we get lucky , measure ) the production rate of @xmath0 .",
    "the production rate for @xmath12+jets is a free parameter in the fit .",
    "other parameters are related to systematic errors and treated in the likelihood as nuisance parameters constrained within their expected ( normal ) distributions .",
    "we adopt the profiling method  @xcite for dealing with these parameters , i.e. the likelihood is maximized with respect to the nuisance parameters .",
    "taking this into account the likelihood takes the following expression : @xmath66 where @xmath67 are the nuisance parameters , such as @xmath68 , @xmath62 and etc .",
    "@xmath69 are their central nominal values and @xmath70 are their uncertainties .",
    "@xmath71 is a gaussian function centered at @xmath69 of width @xmath70 .",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath0 depends on knowing accurately the distribution of ( @xmath57 ) in data .",
    "we consider several sources of uncertainty including the jet energy scale , @xmath12+jets @xmath72 scale , initial and final state radiation ( isr and fsr ) , parton distrubiton function ( pdf ) uncertaintity and others .",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath0 depends on knowing accurately the distribution of ( @xmath57 ) in data .",
    "one of the largest sources of uncertainty comes from a factor that has a large effect on the shape of the kinematic distribution , the jet energy scale .",
    "jets in the data and mc are corrected for various effects as described in  @xcite , leaving some residual uncertainty .",
    "this uncertainty results in possible shifts in the @xmath53 and @xmath51 distributions for both new physics and standard model templates .",
    "we take this effect into account by generating templates with energies of all jets shifted upwards by one standard deviation ( + 1 templates ) and downwards ( -1 templates ) respectively .",
    "we then use a template morphing technique that was developed in 2005 for a previous version of this analysis .",
    "we interpolate and extrapolate the expectation value @xmath59 at each bin @xmath25 as follows : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the nominal expectation value , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the expectation values from ( -1 ) and ( + 1 ) templates respectively , and@xmath77 is the nuisance parameter representing the relative shift in jet energy scale : @xmath78        the effect of the choice of the appropriate @xmath72 scale for @xmath12+jets production is evaluated by measuring the resulting change in the measured @xmath0 cross section given that @xmath0 exists .",
    "the @xmath72 scale is varied to @xmath80 and @xmath81 the expected change in the measured cross section is then interpreted as the uncertainty on the @xmath0 cross section itself .",
    "we measure this shift as a function of the @xmath0 cross - section by drawing pseudoexperiments from shifted templates and fitting them to the nominal distribution .",
    "the resulting shift is fitted to a linear function of that @xmath0 cross - section and is incorporated into the likelihood as an additive parameter to the @xmath0 cross section , so that the @xmath0 contribution to the expectation value @xmath82  ( [ mu ] ) in bin @xmath25 becomes @xmath83 where @xmath84 is constrained by a gaussian with a width , that is a half of the largest of the upwards or downwards shifts for each mass of the @xmath0 .           vs @xmath51 distribution showing hte data ( black points ) and the fitted number of background events : qcd ( dark cyan circles ) , @xmath12 + jets ( green squares ) , and @xmath39 ( blue triangles).,width=226 ]    ccc|ccc n & min @xmath85 & min @xmath53 & observed & expected & p - value + & [ gev / c@xmath86 & [ gev ] & & & + 1 & 475 & 775 & 0 & 0.021 & 1.000 + 2 & 450 & 750 & 0 & 0.116 & 1.000 + 3 & 425 & 725 & 1 & 0.228 & 0.2040 + 4 & 400 & 700 & 2 & 0.371 & 0.0540 + 5 & 375 & 675 & 3 & 0.718 & 0.0364 + 6 & 350 & 650 & 4 & 1.503 & 0.0660 + 7 & 325 & 625 & 4 & 2.876 & 0.3251 + 8 & 300 & 600 & 12 & 5.498 & 0.0110 + 9 & 275 & 575 & 14 & 9.885 & 0.1273 + 10 & 250 & 550 & 29 & 18.03 & 0.0105 + 11 & 225 & 525 & 41 & 31.34 & 0.0555 + 12 & 200 & 500 & 58 & 52.05 & 0.2219 + 13 & 175 & 475 & 92 & 91.14 & 0.4779 + 14 & 150 & 450 & 152 & 158.7 & 0.7141 + 15 & 125 & 425 & 222 & 231.0 & 0.7318 +    99 j. silva - marcos jhep 0212 ( 2002 ) 036 , [ arxiv : hep - ph/0204217 ] ; s. sultansoy _",
