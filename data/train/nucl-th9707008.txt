    "when it is completed in 1999 , the relativistic heavy ion collider@xcite ( rhic ) will be energetic enough to produce hadronic final states via , , and  interactions that coherently couple to the nuclei as a whole .",
    "the electromagnetic field of the heavy nuclei can be considered as a flux , proportional to @xmath0 of almost - real weiszcker - williams virtual photons .",
    "the requirement that the photons couple to the entire nucleus limits the maximum photon energy to @xmath5 , about 3 gev / c for gold beams at rhic .",
    "thus , the maximum  energy is about 6 gev ; at energies of a few gev , the luminosity will be comparable to those of the next generation @xmath6 colliders .",
    "interactions can probe a wide variety of physics topics .",
    "particle coupling to two photons is a measure of their internal charge ; @xmath7 mesons couple strongly , but glueballs and mixed states ( @xmath8 ) should have much smaller couplings .",
    "nonobservation in  collisions is therefore an important criteria for identification of glueball candidates@xcite .",
    "collisions can also probe spin 0 or 2 mesons with exotic quantum numbers .",
    "one interesting example is the near - threshold @xmath9 resonance , produced in  collisions at @xmath10 colliders . according to the particle data book , ``",
    "this process has not been explained by models in which only conventional resonances dominate''@xcite .",
    "collisions also produce large numbers of lepton and hadron pairs .",
    "lepton pairs can be used to measure the  and relative hadronic luminosity , and to search for nonlinear qed effects due to the large coupling ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "meson pairs can be used to measure form factors and for a variety of other qcd studies , and baryon pair production can test diquark based models@xcite .",
    "several authors have calculated the  luminosity produced by heavy ion colliders@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the  luminosity can be found by convoluting the photon fields of the two nuclei , and integrating over impact parameter @xmath12 greater than twice the nuclear radius @xmath13 .",
    "the latter criteria avoids events where hadronic collisions overshadow the  interaction , but cuts the usable luminosity by about 50% .",
    "figure  1 compares the usable  luminosities for rhic au , cu , and i beams to those of cleo at cesr and lep2 . the lighter nuclei benefit from the higher @xmath14 luminosity and beam energy , and smaller nuclear radius , which more than compensate for the reduced @xmath15 .",
    "because of the photon energy cutoff , final states are produced quite centrally , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . final states from @xmath16 have a wider @xmath17 distribution , and so , for a given setup , the experimental acceptance is lower .    due to the nuclear form factor ,",
    "the photons are almost real , with a maximum @xmath18 given by the nuclear size , about ( 30 mev / c)@xmath19 for gold .",
    "this cutoff limits the perpendicular momentum of the photons , @xmath20 ; this helps separate coherent from incoherent interactions .",
    "this is illustrated in fig 2 .",
    "the @xmath18 limit will slightly reduce the rate of pair production near threshold@xcite .",
    "in addition to  collisions , the virtual photons can also couple to the pomeron field of the other nucleus .",
    "the pomeron can be thought of as representing the absorptive part of the nuclear potential .",
    "interactions using proton targets were studied extensively at hera .",
    "rhic can study these interactions in a nuclear environment .",
    "one reaction of interest is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a vector meson . in the vector dominance model",
    ", the photon can be considered to fluctuate into a spin 1 @xmath7 state , which then interacts with the nucleus . by studying production rates of various sized mesons , and varying the nuclear radius by changing the beams",
    ", the interactions between quark pairs and nuclei can be studied@xcite .",
    "the kinematics are similar to processes , so similar detection techniques can be used .",
    "rhic will reach higher energies and luminosities than earlier nmc@xcite and fermilab e-665@xcite studies , producing 100,000 s of exclusive @xmath23 and @xmath24 mesons per year , large numbers of excited states , and the @xmath2 .",
    "the latter is of special interest because the large quark mass may require perturbative treatment .",
    "in addition to photon physics , double pomeron interactions can be studied .",
    "unobscured  interactions can only occur in the impact parameter range @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the range of the pomeron .",
    "the  cross section is thus sensitive to the range of the pomeron . as  and  final states have similar kinematics , a statistical separation is required for this measurement .",
    "the relative rates will depend on @xmath27 ; couplings will dominate for small nuclei and  for large .",
    "in many cases , the same final state can be produced through more than one intermediate state .",
    "therefore , the possibility of interference exists .",
    "one place where it should occur is between the reactions @xmath28 and @xmath29@xcite .",
    "the  and  interactions are out of phase , so the interference angle comes from the real part of the pomeron and phase shift of the vector meson in the nuclear potential .",
    "measurements of coherent interactions are only possible if the signals can be separated from incoherent backgrounds@xcite . this must be possible in both the final analysis and also at the trigger level ; the latter appears to be the harder problem .",
    "the major backgrounds to be rejected are grazing nuclear collisions , photo - nuclear interactions , beam gas events , debris from upstream beam breakup , and cosmic ray muons ; the latter two only affect triggering .",
    "star ( the solenoidal tracker at rhic ) , is a general purpose large acceptance detector@xcite .",
    "time projection chambers track charged particles with pseudorapidity @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "a silicon vertex tracker , time of flight system and tpc @xmath32 help with particle identification .",
    "an electromagnetic calorimeter covers the range @xmath33 .",
    "the coherent event trigger algorithms are based on requiring two or four tracks in the central tpc , with nothing else visible in the detector . triggering uses a different set of detectors .",
    "the initial trigger selection uses scintillators and wire chambers ( the anode wires in the tpc endcaps , with a fast readout ) surrounding the tpc to select events based on multiplicity and topology .",
    "two to five possible tracks are required , with a reasonable topology .",
    "timing may be used to help reject cosmic ray muons and beam gas .",
    "higher level trigger algorithms use better hit location information to select events with two or four charged tracks , with tighter topological cuts .",
    "then , the calorimeter and tpc tracking contribute , allowing cuts on neutral multiplicity , total charge , vertex position , and @xmath4 .",
    "monte carlo studies have shown that these trigger algorithms have good acceptance for coherent events , and adequate background rejection .",
    "we have simulated the  signals and backgrounds from grazing nuclear and beam gas@xcite .",
    "we generated tables of luminosity as a function of invariant mass and rapidity , and then created events based on these tables .",
    "@xmath4 spectra are included with a @xmath34 gaussian form factor .",
    "backgrounds were simulated with both the fritiof and venus monte carlos ; the @xmath4 spectra are compared in fig .",
    "2 .    in order to study the effectiveness of different analysis techniques",
    ", we considered three sample analyses that are representative of a wide range of reactions ; these analyses are listed in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath35 is a well understood @xmath7 meson , representative of a wide class of particles that decay to two charged particles .",
    "a spin 0 particle with the same mass and decay channel would have a slightly lower acceptance .",
    "@xmath36 near threshold ( 1.5 gev@xmath37 gev ) is both a very interesting physics signal , and also a good benchmark for medium mass processes decaying to four charged particles .",
    "finally , the 2960 mev @xmath38 @xmath39 resonance @xmath40 was chosen as a real challenge ; the luminosities are falling and the branching ratios are small .",
    "for each analysis , we developed a set of cuts based on the required charged and neutral multiplicity and event topology .",
    "we required @xmath41 mev , and an appropriate invariant mass and found the rates and backgrounds given in table [ tab : rates ] .",
    "although the fritiof and venus background predictions are different , this analysis shows that @xmath42 and threshold @xmath43 reactions should be clearly separable from backgrounds , while the @xmath44 may be accessible with particle identification .",
    ".rates and backgrounds for events for gold on gold collisions at rhic for 3 sample analyses .",
