    "the state of a classical composite system is described in the phase space as a product of its individual constituents separate states whereas the state of a composite quantum system is expressed in the hilbert space as a superposition of tensor products of its individual subsystems states .",
    "therefore the state of a quantum composite system is not necessarily expressible as a product of the individual quantum subsystems states .",
    "this peculiar property of quantum systems is called entanglement , which has no classical analog @xcite .",
    "recently the interest in studying quantum entanglement was sparked by the development in the fields of quantum information and quantum computing which was initiated in the eighties by the pioneering work of benioff , bennett , deutsch , feynman and landauer @xcite .",
    "although there is still no complete theory that can quantify entanglement of a general multipartite system in pure or mixed state , there are few cases where we have successful entanglement measures .",
    "most importantly , bipartite system in a pure state and mixed state of two spin @xmath0 possess such measures , also the pure and mixed multipartite systems using geometric measures such as geometric entanglement and relative entanglement@xcite . quantum information processing and quantum computations can only be performed in a many body system with very complicated arrangements concerning the properties of that system @xcite .",
    "the building unit , smallest for storing information in such a system ( qubit ) , has to be a well defined two state quantum entity that can be easily addressed , manipulated and readout .",
    "the basic idea is to define certain quantum degree of freedom to serve as a qubit , such as the charge , orbital or spin angular momentum .",
    "the next step is to define a controllable mechanism to form coupling between two individual qubits in such a way to produce a fundamental quantum computing gate .",
    "furthermore , we have to be able to coherently manipulate such a mechanism to provide an efficient computational process . on the other hand , quantum phase transitions in many body systems are accompanied by a significant change in the quantum correlations within the system , which led to a great interest in investigating the behavior of quantum entanglement close to the critical points of transitions @xcite .",
    "all these facts and developments sparked great interest in studying entanglement properties in many body systems in general and particularly in quantum spin systems in presence of external magnetic fields at zero and finite temperatures @xcite .",
    "there has been special focus on studying entanglement in one - dimensional spin chains , utilizing the possession of exact analytic solution for many of these systems @xcite .",
    "the raised question of the multipartite entanglement ( me ) versus bipartite entanglement ( be ) and whether they have to coexist and which one is the actual resource for the critical behavior in many body systems has stimulated many investigations . to address this problem several works",
    "have focused on comparing me with be in quantum spin systems .",
    "some of these works made use of the one tangle @xcite as well as the concurrence @xcite for that purpose without explicitly evaluating the global entanglement in the system .",
    "the one tangle @xmath1 represents the entanglement between a single spin with the rest of the system at zero temperature , which is equal to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the single site reduced density matrix . on the other hand",
    ", the sum of the squared of pairwise concurrences , @xmath4 , defines another quantity @xmath5 representing the weight of the pairwise entanglements in the system .",
    "the ratio @xmath6 was introduced as a measure of the fraction of the total entanglement attributed to the pairwise correlations .",
    "the quantification of the global multipartite entanglement in a many body system is a very hard task as it usually requires the solution of a big set of variational equations and the difficulty of the problem increases non - linearly with the dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "few different measures of global entanglement have been proposed , the most common among them are the relative entropy of entanglement @xcite , the robustness of entanglement @xcite , polynomial measure @xcite and the geometric measure @xcite .",
    "particularly , the geometric measure determines the distance between the state under consideration and the closet product state in the hilbert space .",
    "this measure has been used intensively to study the multipartite entanglement in many body systems and especially the one - dimensional spin chain systems utilizing the exact solutions that these systems have @xcite .",
    "natural systems of interest have strong interaction with its environment , which causes decoherence effects @xcite .",
    "particularly , practical many body systems are required to function at finite temperatures , which means that the system will be exposed to thermal excitations and therefore its mixed thermal states should be fully studied and understood .",
    "evaluating the density matrix of mixed thermal states of many body systems is very hard task due to the large size of the hilbert space of the system in that case .",
    "recently , so much attention has been directed to investigating me versus be in thermal states of many body systems and their relative robustness to temperature , exploring the feasibility of achieving hight temperature entangled states .",
    "the me and be properties in one dimensional @xmath7 spin model in an external field , using monte carlo simulation , were investigated @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the system possesses a factorized ground state @xcite signalled by vanishing @xmath1 and @xmath5 and a quantum phase transition corresponding to an anomaly in the ratio @xmath8 in the form of a narrow minimum versus the magnetic field .",
    "this suggests that the pairwise correlations suffer a big loss across the quantum critical point in contrary to me which dominates and as a result me can be safely considered as the actual resource for the observed quantum phase transition .",
    "the minimum of the factor @xmath8 was suggested as an estimator of the quantum critical points .",
    "also a class of one dimensional @xmath9 spin systems , with different degrees of anisotropy , was shown to have factorizable ground states @xcite where the pairwise entanglement range diverges while approaching this separable states indicating a long range reshuffling of entanglement . at finite temperature , using @xmath5 and concurrence , it was demonstrated that the system may emerge from a separable state into a mixed thermal entangled state with no pairwise entanglement present , i.e. containing only multipartite entanglement . me of a subsystem of three arbitrary spins in a 1d @xmath10 spin chain in an external magnetic field was evaluated @xcite , using the negativity between one spin and the other two @xcite , and compared with be of each pair of these three spins , it was shown that me enjoys a longer range compared with be through the chain . at finite temperature",
    ", it was demonstrated that me is more robust than be for a block of three adjacent spins , where me is still present though there is no pairwise entanglement left in the system .",
    "quite few works have studied the quantification and behavior of global multipartite entanglement in thermal states of many body systems and mainly focused on systems possessing analytic solutions such as one dimensional spin chains ( e.g. @xcite ) . to overcome the difficulties of evaluating the global entanglement in the thermal mixed states of many body systems ,",
    "there has been an approach to provide a transition temperature below which the multipartite entanglement is guaranteed in such systems based only on information about the ground state of the system and its partition function @xcite .",
    "using this approach , the robustness of me in thermal states of one - dimensional spin-1/2 @xmath10 system was investigated and the threshold temperature for vanishing entanglement was estimated @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that the threshold temperature increases montonically with the magnetic field in the region of large values of the field . due to the big computational difficulties ,",
    "there is a big lack in investigations in two - dimensional ( and higher ) quantum systems with few notable exceptions @xcite .",
    "these works have focused on studying entanglement in two - dimensional finite and infinite square lattices using monte carlo simulations or the projected entangled - pair states @xcite and used concurrence , one - tangle and fidelity to quantify multipartite entanglement and determine points of separable ground states and phase transitions at zero temperature .    in this paper , we consider two different systems of finite number of spins , each in presence of an external transverse magnetic field in contact with a heat bath at temperature @xmath11 .",
    "we provide an extensive investigation of a two - dimensional @xmath10 spin-1/2-star model but also study a one dimensional @xmath10 spin-1/2 chain for the sake of comparison with the two - dimensional system and the one - dimensional previous results as well .",
    "the number of spins in each system is 7 and the nearest neighbor spins are coupled through an exchange interaction @xmath12 .",
    "we investigate and compare the bipartite and the global multipartite entanglement of both systems under the effect of an external transverse magnetic field , thermal excitations and different degrees of anisotropy .",
    "we use the entanglement of formation and geometric entanglement as measures of the bipartite and global multipartite entanglements respectively .",
    "we show that , for both cases , in the anisotropic and partially isotropic systems at zero temperature the multipartite and bipartite entanglements can be maintained at high magnetic field values where the nearest neighbor and multipartite entanglements assume very small values but still much higher than that of the next to nearest ones .",
    "also we demonstrate that the threshold temperature , at which the entanglement vanishes , is higher for the nearest neighbor entanglement compared to both of the next to nearest neighbor bipartite and multipartite entanglements .",
    "therefore nearest neighbor bipartite entanglement is more robust to thermal excitations compared to the next to nearest bipartite and global multipartite entanglements in these systems .",
    "also we demonstrated how an impurity can be used to tune and enhance the threshold temperature of all types of entanglement .",
    "we also examined the persistence of quantum effects at high temperatures by observing the entanglement behavior and show that we may maintain non zero entanglement at considerably high temperatures by applying strong enough magnetic fields .",
