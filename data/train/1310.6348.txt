    "the bessel functions are defined by @xcite @xmath1 these functions satisfy several addition formulas @xcite .",
    "for example the graf s addition formula @xmath2 where @xmath3 for general @xmath4 and due to neumann ( 1867 ) for @xmath5 ( see @xcite ) . + another addition formula obtained by gegenbauer , is more connected with the theory of spherical waves .",
    "it is @xmath6 where @xmath7 are the ultraspherical polynomials ( see @xcite ) .",
    "+ formula ( 1.3 ) implies a product formula for bessel functions , important in harmonic analysis and applied mathematics .",
    "it is related to the generalized translation associated with the bessel operator introduced by j. delsarte @xcite .",
    "also , the product formula together with its positivity plays a central role in the development of the classical harmonic analysis .",
    "+ many @xmath0-analogues of the bessel functions exist .",
    "the oldest ones were introduced by jackson in 19031905 .",
    "they were rewritten in modern notation by ismail @xcite .",
    "other @xmath0-analogues can be obtained as formal limit cases of the three @xmath0-analogues of jacobi polynomials , i.e. , of little @xmath0-jacobi polynomials , big @xmath0-jacobi polynomials and askey - wilson polynomials .",
    "for this reason we propose to speak about little @xmath0-bessel functions , big @xmath0-bessel functions and aw type @xmath0-bessel functions respectively for the corresponding limit cases ( see @xcite ) . also observe that the little @xmath0-bessel functions were already given by jackson ( 1904 ) , and that they are often called jackson s third @xmath0-bessel functions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "+ in this paper we are concerned with the little @xmath0-bessel functions defined by @xcite @xmath8 it will be convenient to use the slightly different functions @xmath9 called normalized little @xmath0-bessel functions , which are defined by @xcite @xmath10 there are now several addition formulas available for little @xmath0-bessel functions . the first one is a @xmath0-analogue of graf s addition formula @xcite , established by r. f. swarttouw by using an analytic method .",
    "a special cases of this addition formula is a @xmath0-analogue of neumann s addition formula for little @xmath0-bessel functions @xmath11 .",
    "+ the second addition formula is also a @xmath0-extension of graf s addition formula .",
    "this formula has originally been discovered by koelink @xcite using the interpretation of the little @xmath0-bessel functions on the quantum group of plane motions .",
    "+ the third addition formula is a @xmath0-analogue of gegenbauer s addition formula derived by r. f. swarttouw @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper to point out that a new addition formula for the little @xmath0-bessel functions can be derived as a limiting case of an addition formula for the little @xmath0-jacobi polynomials established by floris and koelink ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our procedure is suggested by the observation that the normalized little @xmath0-bessel functions @xmath12 can be obtained as a confluent limit of the little @xmath0-jacobi polynomials .",

    "bessel functions are limit cases of some orthogonal polynomials .",
    "a well known limit transition is the one between the normalized jacobi polynomials and the bessel functions @xmath44 , which we can rewritten as @xmath45 where @xmath46 the @xmath0-analogue of limit transition starts with the little @xmath0-jacobi polynomials , which are defined by @xmath47 and which satisfy the orthogonality relation @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 see @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-analogue of the limit from the little @xmath0-jacobi polynomials @xmath51 to the normalized little @xmath0-bessel functions is given in the following proposition .",

    ", the summand of the sum at the right hand side can be majorized by @xmath57 and @xmath58 on the other hand a simple calculation shows that @xmath59 then the result follows from and by dominated convergence .",
    "another limit transition from orthogonal polynomials to the bessel functions , starts with the krawtchouk polynomials @xcite . in this work",
