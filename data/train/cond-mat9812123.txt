    "recently much attention has been attracted to the properties of la@xmath2a@xmath3mno@xmath1 , with a = ca , sr , ba , and related compounds , in which the colossal magnetoresistance and metal - insulator transition are observed.@xcite the parent compound , lamno@xmath1 , is insulating with layered - type antiferromagnetic ( af ) ordered state ( the a - type antiferromagnet ) , accompanied by the orbital order with alternation of @xmath0 orbitals occupied by a single electron of mn@xmath4 ions.@xcite such orbitally ordered states might be promoted by a cooperative jahn - teller effect,@xcite playing a decisive role in charge transport,@xcite but could also result from an electronic instability.@xcite the latter possibility is now under debate , as the band structure calculations performed within the extension of local density approximation ( lda ) to strongly correlated transition metal oxides , the so - called lda+u approach , give indeed charge - ordered ground states without assuming lattice distortions as their driving force.@xcite charge ordering was also found within the hartree - fock calculations on lattice models by mizokawa and fujimori.@xcite    the dominating energy scale in late transition metal oxides is the local coulomb interaction @xmath5 between @xmath6 electrons at transition metal ions which motivates the description of ground state and low - energy excitations in terms of effective models with spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "such models , introduced both for the cuprates,@xcite and more recently for the manganites,@xcite show that the spin and orbital degrees of freedom are interrelated which leads to an interesting problem , even without doping .",
    "orbital interactions in the ground state lead to a particular orbital ordering that depends on the magnetic ordering , and vice versa .",
    "an interesting aspect of such system is that the elementary excitations have either a pure spin , or pure orbital , or mixed spin - orbital character.@xcite this gives large quantum fluctuation corrections to the order parameter in af phases , and it was discussed recently that this might lead to a novel type of a spin - liquid.@xcite in a special case of ferromagnetic ( fm ) order ( which represents a simplified spinless problem ) , only orbital excitations contribute to the properties of the ground state and the quantum effects are expected to be smaller .    unlike in the cuprate materials ,",
    "hole doping in the manganites leads to fm states , insulating at low doping , and metallic at higher doping.@xcite although the fm phase is unstable for the undoped lamno@xmath1 , the building blocks are fm planes .",
    "a proper understanding of pure orbital excitations has to start from the uniform fm phase , where the spin operators can be integrated out .",
    "such a state could possibly be realized in lamno@xmath1 at large magnetic field and will serve as a reference state to consider hole propagation in doped manganites , similarly as the af spin state provides a reference state for the hole propagation in the cuprates .",
    "therefore , we consider in this paper an effective model with only orbital superexchange interactions which involves the @xmath0 states and results from the effective hamiltonians derived in refs . in the relevant high - spin state",
    "of course , it is identical for the cuprates and for the manganites .",
    "we note , however , that orbital interactions may be also induced by lattice distortions , but these contributions are expected to be less important than the orbital superexchange,@xcite and will be neglected .",
    "so far , little is known about the consequences of orbital excitations for long - range order and transport properties in doped systems , but it might be expected that such excitations either bind to a moving hole , or lead to hole scattering even when the spins are aligned.@xcite the knowledge of orbital excitations is a prerequisite for a better understanding of the temperature dependence of the resistivity and optical conductivity in the fm phase of doped manganites . although the double exchange mechanism is quite successful in explaining why the spin order becomes fm with increasing doping of la@xmath2a@xmath3mno@xmath1 , it fails to reproduce the experimentally observed temperature dependence of the resistivity.@xcite even more puzzling and contradicting naive expectations is the incoherent optical conductivity with a small drude peak observed in a fm metallic phase at higher doping.@xcite this behavior demonstrates the importance of orbital dynamics in doped manganites which appears to be predominantly incoherent in the relevant parameter regime.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows .",

    "we consider a three - dimensional ( 3d ) mott insulator with one @xmath0 electron per site .",
    "the effective hamiltonian which describes @xmath0 electrons in a cubic crystal at strong - coupling,@xcite @xmath7 consists of the superexchange part @xmath8 , and the orbital splitting term due to crystal - field term @xmath9 . here",
    "we will consider a special case of the fm @xmath0 band in which the spin dynamics is integrated out and one is left with the effective interactions between the electrons ( holes ) in different orbital states . in this case the only superexchange channel which contributes is the effective interaction via the high - spin state , and thus the interaction occurs only between the pairs of ions with singly occupied orthogonal @xmath0 orbitals at two nearest - neighbor sites ( two orthogonal @xmath0 orbitals are then singly occupied in the intermediate excited states ) .",
    "an example of such a model is the superexchange interaction in the fm state of lamno@xmath1 which originates from @xmath10 excitations ( with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 ) into a high - spin @xmath14 state @xmath15 , as shown schematically in fig .",

    ", one has to determine first the classical ground state of the system that will serve as a reference state to calculate the gaussian fluctuations . neglecting the irrelevant phase factors ,",
    "the classical configurations which minimize the interaction terms ( [ hamorb ] ) are characterized by the two - sublattice pseudospin order , with two angles describing orientations of pseudospins , one at each sublattice .",
    "as usually , the classical ground state is obtained by minimizing the energy with respect to these two rotation angles , i.e. , by choosing the optimal orbitals .",
    "let us consider first the term @xmath8 at orbital degeneracy @xmath54 .",
    "the superexchange interaction ( [ generic ] ) induces the alternation of _ orthogonal orbitals _ in the ground state in all three directions , and is equivalent to the _ two - sublattice af ( g - af ) order in the pseudospin space_. this configuration gives the lowest energy on the mean - field level , as the virtual transitions represented in fig . 1",

    "_ a priori _ , the optimal choice of the occupied orbitals could be unique on the classical level due to the cubic symmetry of superexchange interaction ( [ generic ] ) .",

    "the classical energy is @xmath109 therefore , one finds the same energy of @xmath103 as in a 3d model at orbital degeneracy .",
    "this shows that the _ orbital superexchange interactions are geometrically frustrated _ , and the bonds in the third dimension can not lower the energy , but only allow for restoring the rotational symmetry on the classical level and rotating the orthogonal orbitals in an arbitrary way .",

    "interestingly , the value of the field at which the orbitals are fully polarized is reduced by one third from the value obtained in three dimensions ( [ cos3d ] ) .",
    "this shows that although the orbital exchange energy can be gained in a 3d model only on the bonds along two directions in the alternating ( orbital - flop ) phase either at or close to @xmath54 , one has to counteract the superexchange on the bonds in all three directions when the field is applied .",

    "first we calculate nearest - neighbor correlation function in the ground state @xmath165 , where the operators with a tilde refer to a rotated basis , @xmath166 so that the correlation function depends on two angles : @xmath85 and @xmath167 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] the intersite orbital correlation in the ground state is shown as a contour - plot .",
    "white ( dark ) regions correspond to positive ( negative ) values , respectively .",
    "one finds that the neighbor correlations have their largest value if the orbitals are rotated by @xmath107 and @xmath168 ( or @xmath169 and @xmath170 ) , i.e. , under this rotation of the basis states the system looks like a ferromagnet , indicating that the occupied @xmath171 and @xmath172 orbitals are alternating in a 2d model , as shown in fig . [ fig : orbitals ] .",
    "note that quantum fluctuations are small as in the ground state and one finds @xmath173 .",
    "this demonstrates at the same time the advantage of basis rotation in the exact diagonalization study , because in the original unrotated basis one finds instead @xmath174 , which might lead in a naive interpretation to a large overestimation of quantum fluctuations .",
    "the ground - state correlations @xmath175 are in excellent agreement with the lswt results . by comparing the results obtained at @xmath176 , @xmath177 and @xmath178 we found that the calculated low - temperature correlation functions are almost identical in this temperature range , and thus the values shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] for @xmath176 are representative for the ground state .",
    "they demonstrate an instability of the system towards the symmetry - broken state .",
    "this finding is similar to the haf , where such a tendency could also be found , in spite of the relatively small size of the considered clusters.@xcite the intersite correlations decrease at higher temperatures , and thus the results at higher temperatures @xmath179 differ dramatically from those presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] . by investigating the temperature dependence of the orbital correlation functions",
    "it has been recently established that the orbital order melts at @xmath180.@xcite    next we discuss the results for the dynamical orbital response functions in the case of orbital degeneracy .",
    "the dynamic structure factors for the orbital excitations are defined as , @xmath181 the corresponding orbital response functions evaluated with respect to the _ rotated _ local quantization axis , @xmath182 and @xmath183 , are defined instead by tilded operators ( [ ttilde ] ) . the lsw approximation does not allow to investigate the consequences of the coupling of single excitonic excitations to the order parameter , represented by the terms @xmath184 , as these terms contribute only in cubic order when the expansion to the bosonic operators is made .",
    "therefore , the mixed terms involving products of @xmath185 and @xmath186 at two neighboring sites in the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ hamorb ] ) could contribute only in higher order spin - wave theory .",
    "this motivated us to perform similar calculations within finite temperature diagonalization for the simplified hamiltonian without these terms , which we refer to as the truncated hamiltonian .",
    "the transverse and longitudinal orbital response functions , @xmath187 and @xmath188 , calculated for the full orbital hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ hamorb ] ) , and with respect to the original choice of orbital basis @xmath55 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trans ] .",
    "the response functions consist in each case of a dominant pole accompanied by a pronounced satellite structure , both for the transverse and longitudinal excitations .",
    "the dominant pole energies are close to the two modes found by the spin - wave analysis , but the energies are lowered for those momenta which show strong satellite structures at higher energies . in order to establish that these satellite structures are , in spin - wave language , due to higher - order processes in spin - wave theory , we performed the same calculation for the truncated hamiltonian .",
    "one finds then an excellent agreement ( fig .",
    "[ fig : trans ] ) between the single modes which result from the numerical diagonalization and the position of the orbital - wave as determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega_phi ] ) .",
    "an additional numerical check was made using the rotated orbital basis which determines the transverse correlations @xmath189 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transrot ] . here",
    "@xmath107 and @xmath168 for @xmath81 and @xmath83 sublattice , respectively .",
    "in contrast to the unrotated orbital basis , we find that the dispersive poles in the longitudinal excitation spectrum vanish entirely",
    ". instead , this missing mode appears now in the transverse channel , where both modes are found and are accompanied by the satellite structures .",
    "we note that the response functions in the rotated basis resemble the response functions of a haf , where the spin - wave excitations are also found only in the transverse response function.@xcite as before , the satellite structures disappear and two distinct peaks with the same intensities are found , if the truncated hamiltonian is used .",
    "these two peaks merge into a single structure at those values of @xmath190 at which @xmath191 .",
    "the successful comparison of the lswt results with the numerical diagonalization is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : exact+lsw ] , where the first moment of the spectra of the full hamiltonian , the single mode which results from the truncated hamiltonian , and the dispersion from the lswt [ as found from eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega_phi ] ) at @xmath106 and neglecting the dispersion due to @xmath192 , @xmath193 are compared .",
    "clearly , fig .",
    "[ fig : exact+lsw ] shows an excellent agreement between the dispersions calculated within different approaches . from the fact that the first moment of the response functions for the full hamiltonian coincides with the response functions of the truncated hamiltonian",
    ", we conclude the lswt approach captures the leading terms in orbital dynamics , and the satellite structure for the full hamiltonian is due to higher - order orbital - wave interactions that are not taken into account within lswt .    as already discussed in secs .",
    "[ sec : model ] and [ sec : numerical ] , the orbitals are tilded in the direction of the effective orbital field due to the orbital splitting . this behavior is also found in our diagonalization studies , and one finds that the expectation values @xmath194 and @xmath195 depend on the orbital splitting @xmath77 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rotation ] ) .",
    "both correlation functions are calculated using the unrotated basis - set .",
    "although the crossover to the uniform state with @xmath51 orbitals occupied is smooth in the numerical study , the agreement with the result of the lwst approach is once again very good .",
    "in summary we considered the low - energy effective model for strongly correlated electrons in two - fold degenerate @xmath0 bands and investigated the consequences of the orbital degrees of freedom for a fm system at half - filling .",
    "although a saturated ferromagnet might only be realized in undoped systems in high magnetic fields , we believe that this model is a relevant starting point in order to understand the influence of orbital dynamics in fm doped transition metal oxides , such as the colossal magnetoresistance manganites .",
    "the fm state can be considered as the reference state into which holes are doped .",
    "we have shown that the orbitals order and alternate between the two sublattices , which is equivalent to the af order in the ( orbital ) pseudospin space .",
    "the orbital excitation spectrum consists of two branches , one of which is found to be gapless in the 3d system within lswt .",
    "this is a consequence of the degeneracy of the model at a classical level .",
    "thus , we find here a quite peculiar situation .",
    "although the hamiltonian is not invariant under a global orbital rotation @xmath56 [ see eq . ( 7 ) ] , and the correlation functions along the different directions change with @xmath56 , this rotation does not affect the energy of the _ classical _ ground state .",
    "it turns out , however , that quantum fluctuation corrections to the ground state energy _ restore the cubic symmetry _ and select the rotation angle at either @xmath142 , or @xmath196 , or @xmath197 .",
    "for these states the orbital excitation spectra are purely 2d , which demonstrates that in fact the _ effective dimensionality of the orbital model ( [ hamorb ] ) is reduced to two .",
    "_ we note that for a gapless 2d dispersion of the orbital excitations in three dimensions one expects that orbital long - range order disappears away from @xmath198 , like in the 2d heisenberg model .    the orbital model ( [ somfff ] ) has novel and interesting quantum properties , and is quite different from the heisenberg model .",
    "in contrast to the haf , the quantum fluctuations in zero field are _ smaller _ in the 2d than in the 3d orbital model , and the 2d model is therefore _ more classical _ due to the anisotropy of the orbital interactions . however , a finite splitting of the orbitals @xmath77 opens a gap in the excitation spectrum of a 3d model , and the quantum effects in an orbital - flop phase stable at small values of @xmath199 are then reduced .",
    "both in a 3d and 2d case , the orbital excitation spectra become gapless at the crossover value of @xmath77 at which the fm orbital order sets in .",
    "the quantum fluctuations are then identical and reach their maximum .",
    "we have verified that the linear approximation within the spin - wave theory reproduces the essential features of the orbital excitation spectra in the present situation , where the total pseudospin quantum number and the @xmath34th component of total pseudospin are not conserved .",
    "first of all , the results of the lswt and the first moments of the orbital excitation spectra obtained from the finite temperature diagonalization yield two modes in excellent quantitative agreement in a 2d model , when the anomalous interactions @xmath200 are neglected .",
    "second , the inclusion of these terms in exact diagonalization leads to a satellite structure in the response functions , while the first moment remains almost unchanged . in order to calculate the satellites observed in the exact diagonalization one needs to go beyond the leading order in the spin - wave theory , and include the cubic terms in the boson operators .",
    "the comparison with finite temperature diagonalization allows us to conclude that orbital waves with the dispersion of the order of @xmath156 are characteristic for the fm states of the undoped degenerate @xmath0 systems.@xcite    we believe that the presented analytic treatment of orbital excitations provides a good starting point for considering the dynamics of a single hole in the orbital model .",
    "this would allow to understand the origin of puzzling optical and transport properties of the doped manganites and clarify the expected differences with the hole dynamics in the @xmath201 model .",
