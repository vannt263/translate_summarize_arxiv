    "the interest in non - periodic tiling is shared by seemingly different groups of people , such as crystallographers , mathematicians , artists , or just individuals interested in the beauty of geometric patterns .",
    "the discovery of the first quasicrystals @xcite in the eighties of the last century triggered many solid state physicists and chemists to explore solids having structures intermediate between crystallographically ordered and completely amorphous materials .",
    "mathematicians designed new concepts to distinguish and classify structures showing aperiodic order .",
    "an extensive description of the achievements up to now is given in the excellent book by michael baake and uwe grimm @xcite .    a powerful way to generate",
    "an aperiodic tiling is by the repetitive substitution of a set of basic tiles , the socalled prototiles .",
    "the most commonly used _ tiling substitution rules _",
    "contain a prescription of the way in which the linearly expanded prototiles are replaced by a number of original prototiles .",
    "this type of substitution rule is called geometric in@xcite , to distinguish it from a combinatorial one .",
    "the most famous substitution tilings based on pairs of rhomb tiles with opening angles @xmath3 are the ammann - beenker ( @xmath4 ) @xcite and the penrose ( @xmath5 ) @xcite @xcite tiling .",
    "for the socolar ( @xmath6 ) @xcite and goodman - strauss(@xmath7 ) @xcite tiling a set of three rhomb tiles are needed .",
    "the goodman - strauss tiling was later generalised to arbitrary @xmath8 by harriss @xcite .",
    "his general substitution tile is composed of 16 prototiles , having edges with either a dent or a dimple in the middle with an edge angle of @xmath9 .",
    "special substitution rules had to be designed for the smaller substitution tiles . in the following section",
    "we will show that an even more general approach is possible .",
    "the model is based on the observation that the combined area of the pair of rhomb prototiles @xmath10 and @xmath11 is proportional to the area of the rhomb prototile @xmath12 , the proportionality factor @xmath13 being independent of @xmath14 .",
    "consequently , substitution tiles @xmath15 may be constructed from a combination of prototiles @xmath12 and pairs of tiles @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath17 and @xmath18 are their numbers respectively , the area of the substitution tile is    @xmath19        a second requirement for a tiling of the entire plane is to realize proper edge substitutions .",
    "we will assume that all four substitution tile edges have the same shape .",
    "neighboring edges at the opening angle are related by a rotation over that angle and opposite edges are related by a translation ( figure [ fig : substitutiontileedgeshape ] ) .",
    "this edge arrangement also ensures that the substitution tile area is equal to the inflated rhomb area , and , therefore , @xmath20 is equal to the _ areal scaling factor_. the angles between the outer prototile edges and the substitution tile rhomb edge will be called the _ edge angles _ @xmath21 . for now , we will assume that overhangs are not allowed and @xmath22 .",
    "the length of the substitution tile rhomb edge    @xmath23    is the _ inflation factor _ of the rhomb tiles . because the areal scaling factor @xmath20 is the square of @xmath24 , equations [ eq : arealeft ] and [ eq : inflationfactor ]",
    "can be combined into    @xmath25    this equality can only be satisfied , if the arguments @xmath26 and @xmath27 are both equal to an integer times @xmath9 for all @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "there are two solutions : either all angles @xmath21 are equal to an integer times @xmath9 , or all of them are equal to a half - integer times @xmath9 .    because the beginning and end of the substitution edge have to be at the endpoints of the substitution tile rhomb edge , the following relationship between the edge angles @xmath21 should be met : @xmath30    a general solution is that the edge angles @xmath21 occur in @xmath31-pairs or are zero and @xmath32 .",
    "this solution is valid if @xmath33 is a multiple of 3 .",
    "an example satisfying this condition is the lord tiling , having edge angles @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "@xmath36 in this case , and the edge sequence is @xmath37 . in this paper , however , we will only consider the more general @xmath31 pairing condition . ] , and equation [ eq : areacomp ] becomes    @xmath38    or @xmath39    equations [ eq : areaint ] or [ eq : areahalfint ] determine the type and number of prototiles @xmath16 from which the substitution tile can be constructed , once the shape of the substitution tile edge has been chosen . in view of the above considerations ,",
    "this edge shape may be characterized by a sequence of integers or halfintegers , the _ edge sequence _ @xmath40 , defined by @xmath41 , @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "if the finite edge angles are present as pairs in accordance with equation [ eq : sumedgesines ] , always a valid solution for the substitution tile is obtained , because both sides may be written as a sum of cosine terms having even valued coefficients .",
    "the pairing of the edge angles , therefore , guarantees that the substitution tiles are composed of an integer number of prototiles .",
    "equations [ eq : areaint ] or [ eq : areahalfint ] constitute a connection between the prototile edge angle pairs @xmath43 and the numbers of prototiles in a substitution tile @xmath18 , not their arrangement .",
    "the relations do not guarantee that a consistent set of substitution tiles can be found .",
    "however , in the following we will show that a general set of substitution rhomb tiles can be constructed for arbitrary @xmath33 and for an arbitrary substitution tile edge shape .",
    "we start with a construction of the circumpherence of the tile @xmath15 as described earlier and illustrated in figure [ fig : substitutiontileedgeshape ] .",
    "next , copies of the edges are translated to the breaks of neighboring edges .",
    "if the breaks of the upper and lower left edge are indexed as @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively , starting at the left corner as indicated in figure [ fig : generalscheme ] ) , one obtaines a grid of vertices @xmath46 , at which four prototiles meet .",
    "the one bounded by the vertices @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 is a prototile of the type @xmath50 .",
    "the vertices at diagonal positions are occupied by tiles @xmath12 , whereas one can find pairs of tiles @xmath51 at off - diagonal positions @xmath46 and @xmath52 .",
    "this general substitution rule may be represented by the following matrix    @xmath53    for later use one should note , that the prototiles parallel to the substitution edges , i.e. the rows or columns of the matrix , form worms , and the edges of the worms have shapes identical to the edge shape of the substitution tile .",
    "the prototiles are allowed to have indices @xmath54 or @xmath55 .",
    "these prototiles will have negative areas , meaning that they have to be subtracted from the tiling .",
    "we consider a tiling of the plane to be a legitimate one , if in the end there are no holes or overlaps .",
    "so , negative or subtraction tiles are allowed , if they remove all overlaps between tiles and do not leave holes in the tiling . in one of the next sections , we will reason , that this is presumably the case for substitution edges without loops . also the zero area prototiles for which @xmath56 or @xmath33 play a important role in our scheme and can not simply be neglected .",
    "we will now discuss one of the simplest examples of this general scheme , i.e. the one with @xmath57 and @xmath58 . from [ eq : areaint ] it follows that @xmath59 for @xmath60 we get @xmath61 and @xmath62 and the @xmath63 general substitution tile is @xmath64 the edge sequence is ( 1 , -1 ) and the inflation factor @xmath65 .",
    "tiles for @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath67 and @xmath68 tiles have been constructed using negative area prototiles.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    in figure [ fig : full - dent-9 - 2x2-tiles ] all first generation substitution tiles , constructed using the general scheme outlined in the previous section , are shown for @xmath66 .",
    "negative areas are colored white in a gray background .",
    "the @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath68 substitution tiles are constructed in exactly the same way as the general tile , i.e. the @xmath14 tiles are rotated over @xmath72 and connected with the unrotated @xmath73 tiles . for @xmath69 two zero area prototiles @xmath74 , which are lines of length 2 , a @xmath75 prototile and a @xmath76 subtraction prototile have to be used .",
    "the normal and subtraction tile annihilate each other , and the substitution tile is reduced to a zigzag line .",
    "this is most easily seen by considering tiles @xmath77 , and @xmath78 letting @xmath79 approach @xmath80 . for @xmath81 , on the other hand , the @xmath82 and the @xmath83 tiles do not overlap and the substitution tile consists of a positive and negative part .",
    "however , the total area is zero , as it should . for @xmath84",
    "the negative area @xmath85 tile cuts pieces off the other three prototiles . for @xmath86 the two prototiles",
    "@xmath87 partly overlap .",
    "this overlap is compensated by the negative area @xmath88 tile , leaving a fractional negative region shown in white .",
    "an essential result is that all these tiles have the same dents and dimples as the general tile and can be used to construct larger substitution tiles .",
    "[ fig : harris-5 - 2x2-edges ]     [ fig : kochedges ]     [ fig : kochtiles ]    the prototiles @xmath12 and @xmath89 have identical rhomb shapes and , therefore , one obtains an identical object if one replaces the other .",
    "the same holds if a prototile is rotated over @xmath90 .",
    "however , this is different for higher generation substitution tiles . although the substitution tiles @xmath15 and @xmath91 have the same basic rhomb shapes , their edge configurations are different . a replacement or",
    "a twofold rotation of one or more of the four prototiles , leads to 16 possible tiles with different edge shapes .",
    "the reasoning is as follows : if we fill up a next generation @xmath15 tile , there are four ways to put a @xmath12 or @xmath89 tile at the ( @xmath70 , @xmath70 ) position .",
    "subsequently , two out of four @xmath92 or @xmath93 tiles fit at the ( @xmath70 , @xmath94 ) and ( @xmath94 , @xmath70 ) position .",
    "finally , only one out of four @xmath12 or @xmath89 type tiles matches the edges already present at the ( @xmath94 , @xmath94 ) position .",
    "the total number of tile shapes is , therefore , sixteen .",
    "however , only four of them are consistent with the requirement that the four edge shapes are the same and related to each other by a translation or rotation as defined in figure [ fig : substitutiontileedgeshape ] .",
    "these are : a ) the basic substitution tile , b ) a substitution tile in which all constituent tiles in a ) have been rotated over @xmath90 , c ) a substitution tile in which the @xmath95 tiles are replaced by @xmath96 tiles and d ) a substitution tile in which all constituent tiles in c ) have been rotated over @xmath90 .",
    "another , simpler way to arrive at the four substitution rules is to consider the edge sequence of a tile .",
    "there are two ways to connect an edge between two corners of a rhomb .",
    "consequently , the number of different edge shapes for a substitution tile is @xmath97 , if @xmath98 is the number of prototile edges along the substitution tile edge , which is two in the case considered here .",
    "the four second generation substitution tile varieties are shown for @xmath5 in figure [ fig : fulldent-5 - 2x2-tiles ] and @xmath99 in figure [ fig : fulldent-8 - 2x2 ] .",
    "the first two are mirror symmetric , whereas the last two are asymmetric , but mirror images of each other .",
    "all four sets contain tiles with negative area parts .",
    "these negative areas account for overlapping dimples of neighbouring edges .",
    "they will naturally disappear if the next larger substitution tile is constructed , i.e. overlapping dimples will be filled up with dents of neighboring tiles . in some cases , notably the @xmath81 and @xmath86 tiles , new negative areas will appear at one end of the tile . also in most of the basic substitution tiles of set a ) , the upper part is a negative area part .",
    "second generation substitution tiles with @xmath100 do not have negative area parts for sets b ) , c ) and d ) . in set",
    "b ) this is due to the fact , that the @xmath81 and @xmath86 constituent tiles are used in a rotated position , so that no negative area parts stick out . in sets",
    "c ) and d ) the @xmath81 and @xmath86 prototiles have been replaced by the @xmath69 and @xmath84 prototiles respectively , not having negative area parts by themselves .    because the @xmath14-values of the prototiles in substitution tiles belonging to set a ) and b ) differ by 2 , the even and odd @xmath14 substitution tiles constitute separate subsets , both fully tiling the plane . for",
    "this is also true for sets c ) and d ) , whereas for odd @xmath33 the even and odd tiles intermix .",
    "some of the prototiles are cut into smaller and rather complicated shapes by the subtraction procedure .",
    "the latter is not unique , because the final surface is obtained by cutting the shape of the negative area out of one of two overlapping dents . in figure",
    "[ fig : fulldent-5 - 2x2-tiles ] this region has been filled in quite arbitrarily by showing a linepattern consistent with the symmetry of the tile .",
    "although we can not prove it rigorously , it appears that it will be possible to replace the mutilated tiles by half - prototiles ( triangles ) for @xmath33=5 .",
    "each new generation of @xmath57 substitution tiles will be fourfold in the same way as was described for the second generation .",
    "for each new generation , an edge segment is replaced by a two - segment dent or dimpel .",
    "already after a few generations a large number of different edge shapes are generated . in figure",
    "[ fig : harris-5 - 2x2-edges ] the edge shape is shown for three generations for @xmath5 .",
    "sometimes , overhangs or loops show up .",
    "the latter are due to overlapping neighboring dimples causing negative area parts at the circumpherence of a substitution tile . in figure",
    "[ fig : harris-5 - 2x2-edges ] this is seen to occur once . the way a next generation edge shape is obtained is reminiscent of the construction of a von koch curve @xcite .",
    "an important difference is that in the original von koch construction each segment is replaced by four instead of two new segments .",
    "the actual von koch curve is obtained if substitution rule b ) of figure [ fig : harris-5 - 2x2-edges ] is applied for each new generation .",
    "eight generations of these von koch edges are shown in figure [ fig : kochedges ] , and the corresponding von koch tiles in figure [ fig : kochtiles ] . a complete tiling of the plane",
    "may be generated using either the odd or even @xmath14 tiles .",
    "in section [ sec : generalmodel ] we found that there are two types of edge substitution rules , one with integer and one with half - integer edge angle fractions of @xmath90 , eqs .",
    "[ eq : areaint ] and [ eq : areahalfint ] respectively . in this section",
    "we will discuss the second case . from equation",
    "[ eq : areahalfint ]    @xmath102            if @xmath101 , it follows that @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "thus , like in the case of @xmath57 , four prototiles are involved , but the non - congruent tiles have @xmath14-values differing only by one instead of two , or    @xmath103    the edge sequence is @xmath104 and the inflation factor @xmath105 .    in figure [",
    "fig : halfdent-9 - 2x2-tiles ] the 1st generation substitution tiles for @xmath66 are shown .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath57 substitution tiles ( figure [ fig : full - dent-9 - 2x2-tiles ] ) , negative area tiles are not needed for the construction of positive area tiles .",
    "also in this case , there are four possible edge shapes for the second generation of substitution tiles , depending on how the first generation substitution tiles are combined ( see figure [ fig : halfdent-5 - 2x2-tiles ] for @xmath101 , @xmath5 tilings ) .",
    "the @xmath86 substitution tile of set ( a ) contains a negative area , because the dimples at neighboring edges overlap . in higher generation substitution tiles",
    "this negative area will also appear in the tiles with smaller @xmath14-values .",
    "for set b ) the negative half of the @xmath81 constituent tile does not show up , because it removes the overlap of two @xmath86 tiles .",
    "also in the higher generation tiles negative area will not be visible .",
    "in fact , the shape of the edge of the tiles of set b ) is identical to the shape of the harriss tiles .",
    "the tiles of set c ) and d ) are , like in the @xmath57 case , mirror images of each other . for odd @xmath33 , they can be split up into two sets , both giving a full aperiodic tiling of the plane , one with odd and one with even @xmath14-values .",
    "the one with even @xmath14 tiles is special because no @xmath81 constituent tiles are needed and , therefore , no negative tiles are involved . by neglecting the the @xmath69 tiles , the set of prototiles",
    "is reduced to a conventional one . for @xmath5 the tiling based on the even @xmath14 set , i.e. @xmath106 and @xmath107",
    "is already known as the `` binary '' or lanon billard ( lb ) tiling @xcite .",
    "the odd @xmath14 set contains the @xmath81 tile .",
    "its role is to remove a patch of prototiles at one side of an @xmath84 tile and add it to the other side . a tiling results which is very similar to the lb tiling .",
    "the prototile set for even @xmath33 comprises all @xmath14 tiles from 0 to @xmath33 .",
    "although the negative part of the @xmath81 tile is involved in the substitution rule , the prototiles are not cut up and a tiling consisting of complete prototiles results .",
    "the @xmath101 substitution tiles are identical to a subset of @xmath57 tiles with a doubled @xmath33-value and with even @xmath14-values .",
    "so , the tiles shown in figure [ fig : halfdent-5 - 2x2-tiles ] are also obtained as an even @xmath14 subset of the @xmath57 , @xmath108 case and the even @xmath14 subset of the @xmath57 , @xmath99 tiles shown in figure [ fig : fulldent-8 - 2x2 ] is identical to the @xmath101 , @xmath4 tile set .",
    "in this section we want to reformulate the rhomb substitution model in terms of the edge and tile substitution matrices .",
    "if overhangs are included , the prototile edges in a tiling will point into @xmath109 directions .",
    "each of these is replaced by a number of prototile edges in orientations determined by the edge sequence , i.e. @xmath110 in the same , @xmath111 in the opposite direction and @xmath43 with @xmath112 in directions differing by @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the edge substitution matrix , therefore , is    @xmath115    a tile with index @xmath14 is substituted by @xmath17 prototiles with index @xmath14 , @xmath116 with index @xmath117 and @xmath18 with index @xmath118 and @xmath119 , with @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",

    "this equality determines the type and number of prototiles in a substitution tile . a possible arrangement of the prototiles",
    "is obtained by drawing a grid using parallel copies of the edge .",
    "this arrangement can be expressed in the form of a matrix .",
    "the smallest ( @xmath63 ) substitution tiles were discussed in detail .",
    "two different types can be distingushed , those with an integer and those with a halfinteger edge sequence .",
    "the latter are of special interest , because some of the tilings do not contain tiles cut up by the application of subtraction tiles .",
    "an example is the lb tiling ( @xmath5 ) , which can be generalized to arbitrary @xmath33 .",
