    "the point of this paper is to construct a framework for combinatorially representing spin and spin - structures on triangulated manifolds in a manner suitable for computer implementation .",
    "this should be seen as part of a general effort to merge the techniques of algorithmic 3-manifold theory , such as triangulations , normal surface theory and geometrization with elements of 4-manifold theory .",
    "the governing perspective on spin and spin - structures in this paper comes from the obstruction - theoretic approach to spin structures of milnor @xcite .",
    "although milnor s approach is fundamentally combinatorial in nature , there is some non - trivial work translating milnor s language into a language a modern computer can use . in the end , we put combinatorial spin structures in a formalism perhaps most comparable to forman s discrete morse theory @xcite .",
    "it s assumed the reader is familiar with obstruction theory on manifolds along the lines of milnor and stasheff @xcite .",
    "other references like whitehead @xcite and gompf and stipicz @xcite are also excellent resources for basic obstruction theory .",
    "the types of triangulations allowed in this article are relatively flexible .",
    "for example , _ unordered delta complexes _",
    "@xcite suffice .",
    "the _ ideal triangulations _ of thurston @xcite , a further weakening of unordered delta complexes , are also perfectly acceptable . in short ,",
    "a _ triangulation _ in this paper is a space constructed by gluing simplices together via affine - linear identifications of their boundary facets , and where we demand that the characteristic maps of every simplex is an embedding when restricted to the interior of the simplex .",
    "denote the @xmath0-simplex by @xmath1 .",
    "given @xmath2 the @xmath3-th face map of @xmath4 is the map @xmath5 given by @xmath6 . given a permutation @xmath7 , the induced automorphism of @xmath4 is @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "an _ unordered delta complex _ is a cw - complex @xmath10 such that the domains of the attaching maps are the boundaries of simplices ( rather than discs ) , @xmath11 , and for each @xmath3 , the composite satisfies @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the appropriate characteristic map from the @xmath14-skeleton , and @xmath15 is some permutation .",
    "if all the permutations @xmath16 were the identity , @xmath10 would be an _ ordered delta complex_.    in the literature , there are several available tools for combinatorially representing @xmath17 and @xmath18-manifolds with additional structure on their tangent bundles .",
    "the kaplan algorithm @xcite was perhaps the first ( see @xcite  5.6 , 5.7 for a modern exposition ) .",
    "kaplan s algorithm gives a simple framework to represent spin structures on a @xmath17-manifold given by an integral surgery presentation , and provides a simple tool to determine when such spin - structures extend over the bounding @xmath18-manifold .",
    "another combinatorial representation of @xmath17-manifolds are _ spines _ , popularized by matveev @xcite .",
    "techniques to represent spin - structures on @xmath17-manifold and @xmath18-manifold spines were developed by benedetti and petronio @xcite .",
    "the techniques in this paper would be described as being in the language of the ` frame along the dual @xmath19-skeleton ' in @xcite .",
    "spin - structures on simplicially - triangulated @xmath17-manifolds can be described as combinatorial euler structures of turaev @xcite .",
    "tienne gallais has recently used this technique to study combinatorial euler structures on triangulated @xmath17-manifolds @xcite using forman s combinatorial vector fields to represent euler structures .",
    "one of gallais s observations is that with these techniques , not all combinatorial euler structures are represented on delta complexes .",
    "simplicial triangulations are required to capture _ all _ spin - structures using this technique .",
    "we wish to avoid simplicial triangulations , as unordered delta complexes have proven themselves to be rather efficient means for describing interesting manifold types in both 3-manifold theory @xcite and recently in 4-manifold theory @xcite as well .",
    "throughout this paper , @xmath20 will be a pl @xmath0-manifold .",
