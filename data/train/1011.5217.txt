    "graphene @xcite is a two - dimensional ( 2d ) material with a quasi - relativistic dispersion law that has attracted an outstanding attention of leading experimental as well as theoretical groups all over the world . in 2004 , researchers at manchester university first succeeded in experimental isolation of a monoatomic graphite layer graphene  on an insulating substrate @xcite .",
    "this technological breakthrough was immediately followed by transport measurements@xcite which have shown remarkable properties related to dirac nature of the charge carriers . in particular , a short and wide sample of clean graphene exhibits a pseudo - diffusive charge transport @xcite , with the counting statistics equivalent to that of a diffusive wire @xcite .",
    "this equivalence has been confirmed in recent measurements of conductance and noise in ballistic graphene flakes @xcite .",
    "in contrast to conventional metals , ballistic graphene near the dirac point conducts better when potential impurities are added @xcite .    quantum interference in disordered graphene",
    "is also highly peculiar due to dirac nature of carriers .",
    "in particular , at the dirac point , the minimal conductivity@xcite @xmath0 is `` protected '' from quantum localization in the absence of intervalley scattering @xcite or in the case of a chiral - symmetric disorder @xcite .",
    "away from dirac point , the concentration dependence of graphene conductivity in diffusive samples depends strongly on the nature of scatterers @xcite .",
    "the experimentally observed ( approximately linear ) dependence in most of the samples may be explained by strong impurities creating resonances near the dirac point ( `` midgap states '' ) @xcite , yielding @xmath1 .",
    "alternative candidates are coulomb impurities and/or ripples , leading to@xcite @xmath2 . the dominant type ( or types ) of disorder and",
    "the corresponding disorder strength depend , of course , on technology of the sample preparation .",
    "how important is the electron - electron interaction in graphene ?",
    "recent works demonstrated manifestation of the interaction in dephasing rate providing the cut - off to quantum interference phenomena @xcite , as well as in renormalization of conductivity @xcite .",
    "recent experiments also showed that the interaction plays a particularly prominent role in suspended graphene samples.@xcite in such samples the splitting of integer quantum hall transition ( attributed to interaction - induced spin / valley symmetry breaking ) is observed at magnetic fields as low as 2 t ( i.e. an order of magnitude less than in graphene structures on a substrate ) .",
    "furthermore , one observes also fractional quantum hall plateaus , which indicates the importance of electron correlations.@xcite continuous advances in fabrication of high - quality graphene samples are expected to lead to further enhancement of the role of interaction in graphene .    on the theoretical side",
    ", interactions may have a dramatic impact on quantum electronic transport , especially in systems of reduced dimensionality @xcite .",
    "very generally , the interaction - induced phenomena may be subdivided in two big classes , related to effects of renormalization and inelastic scattering , respectively . in the case of graphene ,",
    "the interaction physics becomes an even more complex problem , in view of the `` relativistic '' dispersion of carriers .",
    "interaction phenomena are particularly strong near the dirac point , where the density of states vanishes ( for a clean system ) , the screening by intrinsic carriers becomes very inefficient , and the drude conductivity ( in the presence of disorder ) is of the order of the conductance quantum .    the dimensionless bare coupling constant @xmath3 describing the coulomb repulsion in graphene samples on a sio@xmath4 insulating substrate is estimated to be @xmath5 and can be yet larger , @xmath6 in suspended graphene sheets .",
    "transport experiments on the interaction correction to conductivity in graphene on a substrate  @xcite have found much smaller values of the interaction constant ( or , equivalently , the interaction parameter @xmath7 ) which can be attributed to the renormalization effects which we briefly overview below .",
    "furthermore , the value of the effective fine structure constant of freestanding graphene as inferred from the results of recent experiments on x - ray scattering in graphite  @xcite was also found to be much smaller than the bare value of @xmath8 .",
    "the interaction effects in the clean graphene have been considered in refs .   within the weak - coupling renormalization - group ( rg ) scheme justified for a large number of flavors of dirac fermions .",
    "the main result of this consideration  @xcite is the renormalization of the fermi velocity and hence of the interaction parameter .",
    "this perturbative renormalization group for graphene thus shows that in the clean case the coulomb interaction is marginally irrelevant . in the disordered case ,",
    "a unified ballistic rg emerges describing renormalization of disorder couplings and of the interaction@xcite . in ref .",
    "the corresponding one - loop rg equations are derived for time - reversal - invariant disorder and in the limit of large number of valleys .    at sufficiently strong @xmath9 ,",
    "the coulomb interaction in a clean graphene has been argued to give rise to various instabilities  @xcite , in particular , to opening the gap in the dirac spectrum of the quasiparticles ( spontaneous mass generation ) .",
    "physically , this instability leads to a phase transition from the semimetallic state to an insulator state , known as excitonic semimetal - insulator transition  @xcite .",
    "recently , this type of instability has been studied by effective mean - field - type approach @xcite , renormalization group method @xcite , and lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "the mean - field consideration of the excitonic - type instability in graphene predicts a certain value of the coupling constant @xmath10 ( close to that in a suspended graphene ) at which the instability occurs . the predicted semimetal - insulator transition ,",
    "however , has not yet been observed in experiments in zero magnetic field .",
    "one of the possible reasons for that might be the presence of disorder @xcite . in strong magnetic field",
    " in the quantum hall effect regime the repulsive interaction between electrons may result in the stoner instability @xcite giving rise to spontaneous breaking of spin and/or valley symmetry .",
    "experiments do show splitting of quantum hall plateaus in strong magnetic fields @xcite , that is attributed to interaction effects .",
    "it has been debated in the literature whether the coulomb interactions in graphene can be theoretically addressed within the standard fermi - liquid - type perturbation theory that requires , in particular that the particle energy is much larger than the decay rate ( @xmath11 ) . in order to understand to what extent graphene is a fermi liquid , one has to explore interaction - induced inelastic collision rates",
    ". the inelastic quantum scattering rate at zero temperature ( and finite quasiparticle energy ) has been considered in refs .  .",
    "it was found in these works that the behavior at dirac point is rather peculiar and requires a careful incorporation of screening .",
    "another highly nontrivial feature of graphene is that inelastic electron - electron collisions may limit the conductivity at the dirac point without any disorder or phonon scattering @xcite .",
    "this peculiarity of graphene  which should be contrasted to conventional systems where interactions do not lead ( in the absence of umklapp scattering ) to finite resistivity  is a consequence of the particle - hole symmetry and decoupling between velocity and momentum . as a result , although the total momentum of interacting particles is conserved during inelastic collisions , the total current may relax .",
    "the collision - limited conductivity of undoped graphene is found to be inversely proportional to @xmath12 and depends on temperature only through the renormalization of @xmath9 .",
    "it was found that the energy relaxation caused by inelastic processes in graphene is fast , which allows one to treat the problem by using a relativistic hydrodynamic approach @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the inelastic electron - electron scattering in graphene within the keldysh diagrammatic approach .",
    "while we focus on the equilibrium situation in this work , we have in mind to extend the treatment of physics of inelastic processes to strongly non - equilibrium setups , which explains why we prefer to work in the framework of the keldysh formalism .",
    "more specifically , our main results are as follows :    * we demonstrate that finite temperature strongly affects the screening properties of graphene , which , in turn , influences the inelastic scattering rates as compared to the zero - temperature case .",
    "* focussing on the high - temperature regime , we calculate the quantum scattering rate which is relevant for dephasing of interference processes .",
    "we identify an hierarchy of regimes arising due to the interplay of a plasmon enhancement of the scattering and finite - temperature screening of the interaction .",
    "* we further discuss the energy relaxation and transport scattering rate in graphene .",
    "our results complement the kinetic - equation and hydrodynamic approaches@xcite for the collision - limited conductivity of clean graphene .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ secmod ]",
    "we define the model and develop the keldysh diagrammatic formalism for treating the problem of coulomb interaction in graphene .",
    "section [ secpolopt ] is devoted to the analysis of polarization operator of graphene .",
    "we first review and discuss the results for the zero temperature case .",
    "then we turn to the case of finite temperature and discuss the properties of the polarization operator . in particular , we compare the approximate form of the dynamically screened interaction propagator with the exact numerical results . in sec .",
    "[ secrates ] we calculate the inelastic scattering rates in the random phase approximation . here",
    "we use the finite - temperature polarization operator obtained in sec .",
    "[ secpolopt ] to treat the problem analytically .",
    "we discuss the asymptotics of the inelastic rates and show that dirac fermions show no fermi liquid behavior .",
    "further , in sec .  [ sectrateancond ] , we discuss the collision - limited conductivity obtained within the diagrammatic approach . in sec .",
    "[ secconcl ] we conclude and summarize the main results of this paper .",
    "technical details of the calculations are presented in three appendices .",
    "in this paper we consider clean graphene near the degeneracy point .",
    "the problem is described by the following hamiltonian , which is a sum of the dirac hamiltonian @xmath13 ( describing the physics of non - interacting electrons in graphene at not too high energies ) and the coulomb interaction term ,    @xmath14    here @xmath15 is the dielectric constant .",

    "however , within each chirality the conventional relation holds : @xmath36    next , we introduce the coupling constant for coulomb interaction in graphene @xmath37 which is similar to the fine structure constant @xmath38 but is @xmath39 times larger . the bare propagator of the coulomb interaction in reads ( in momentum space ) : @xmath40 throughout the paper we assume @xmath41 .",

    "another prominent example of a non - trivial behavior of relaxation rates related to the infrared singularities is a luttinger liquid ( disordered or clean).@xcite on the other hand , within the fermi - liquid theory of clean metals all the inelastic scattering rates behave in the same way , since the characteristic frequency / momenta transfer in the course of electron - electron collisions is determined by temperature .",
    "the goal of this section is to understand whether the situation in clean graphene is similar to the fermi - liquid or not .",
    "we have already mentioned in the introduction ( sec .",
    "[ secint ] ) the previous works on the inelastic quantum scattering rate in graphene  @xcite .",
    "these works addressed the scattering rate at the gr level at zero temperature and obtained the fermi - liquid - type result @xmath144 .",
    "naively , one could think that at finite temperature this consideration would lead to @xmath145 .",
    "however , since the gr result is completely determined by the `` mass shell '' ( @xmath146 ) ( see discussion in sec.[secpolopzt ] ) one concludes that the rpa - resummation ( which kills the on - shell interaction ) would yield @xmath147 for @xmath148 and arbitrary @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the finite-@xmath72 expectation based on the gr is also doubtful .",
    "how the quasiparticle broadening behaves in the experimentally relevant case of finite temperature is thus by far not obvious . as discussed in sec.[secpolopft ] , the finite density of states at non - zero @xmath72 leads to screening of the coulomb interaction , thus justifying the use of the rpa which then sums up the most singular contributions of the interaction for small momenta , @xmath149 . in this section",
    "we find the behavior of inelastic rates at finite temperature within the rpa .",
    "as we have already seen in section [ secpolopft ] , the behavior of the polarization operator at finite temperature is highly non - trivial .",
    "this leads to a rather rich behavior of the scattering rates .",
    "it turns out that , in addition to the temperature scale , two more characteristic scales appear which are relevant for relaxation rates : @xmath150 and @xmath151 . in this section",
    "we will distinguish between the four regimes ( i - iv ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ figscales ] .",
    "the contributions to each of the scattering rates from different regions ( 1 - 4 , see fig .",
    "[ figfinpolopareas ] ) of the momentum - frequency plane are calculated separately .",
    "one of the main manifestations of the inelastic scattering in electronic systems is the interaction - induced dephasing . in order to analyze the effects of dephasing in graphene",
    ", we will follow the route suggested by earlier works on 2d ( in particular , diffusive ) systems.@xcite a natural first step is to calculate the quantum scattering rate @xmath152 which is given by the imaginary part of the quasiparticle self - energy taken at the mass - shell .",
    "indeed , for conventional metals with parabolic dispersion , in the high - temperature ( ballistic ) regime , the dephasing rate @xmath153 to leading order is given by @xmath154 , see ref . .",
    "in the diffusive regime , the scattering kernel acquires an infrared singularity leading to a divergent @xmath154 at finite @xmath72 .",
    "this is a manifestation of the fact that the single - particle self - energy is not a gauge - invariant object ; no divergencies occur in observable ( gauge - invariant ) quantities , such as , e.g. , dephasing rate .",
    "however , even when the quantum scattering rate diverges , the calculation of it turns out to be instructive : a parametrically correct result for the dephasing rate can be obtained from the expression for @xmath154 supplemented with an appropriate infrared cutoff .",
    "it is thus useful to begin with analyzing @xmath154 .",
    "the peculiarity of graphene is that the self - energy is a matrix in the sublattice space , which has a non - zero imaginary part , @xmath155 [ eq .  ] , in the off - diagonal components .",
    "therefore , the definition of the quantum scattering time in graphene is actually not unique .",
    "indeed , one can associate with the quantum scattering rate the on - shell value of the imaginary correction to the energy in the full green s function , @xmath156 [ eq .  ] , similarly to the conventional fermi - liquid theory : @xmath157 here at @xmath158 we have taken the self - energy at the `` @xmath26 '' mass - shell corresponding to the positive energies , @xmath159 , and at @xmath160 on the `` @xmath27 '' mass - shell . clearly , @xmath161 for undoped graphene ( @xmath22 ) because of the particle - hole symmetry . within the rpa",
