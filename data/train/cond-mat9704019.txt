    "a central feature of the composite fermion ( cf ) theory @xcite of the quantum hall effect is that the interaction energy of electrons is transmuted into the kinetic energy of composite fermions . in other words , while the original problem had no kinetic energy ( more precisely , a constant kinetic energy ) but only the interaction energy , the kinetic energy is the important energy of composite fermions , the interaction between which is weak and can be neglected altogether to a good first approximation .",
    "the kinetic energy of composite fermions manifests itself in the form of landau levels ( lls ) of composite fermions , resulting in the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) , and , in an extreme limit , as the fermi sea of composite fermions at the half filled landau level .    in this work",
    ", we will compute the pair distribution function and the static structure factor for filled landau levels of composite fermions , corresponding to fqhe states at @xmath1 , as well as for composite fermions at zero effective magnetic field , using the recently developed lowest - ll representation of the cf wave functions that enables a treatment of large cf systems @xcite .",
    "the qualitative behavior of the results provides a striking evidence for fermi - sea - like correlations in a broad range of filling factors near the half - filled landau level .",
    "the results obtained below are valid to the extent the cf wave functions are .",
    "the cf wave functions have been compared extensively to the exact eigenstates , available numerically for systems containing @xmath2 particles , and found to have close to 100% overlap with them @xcite .",
    "it is quite plausible that the excellent agreement will persist to larger systems and also for other incompressible fqhe states , suggesting that the cf wave functions should be reliable up to 9/19 , which is the fraction closest to 1/2 where experimental indications for fqhe have been observed @xcite .",
    "there is sound experimental evidence that the cf description is valid for the compressible state at @xmath3 as well @xcite . here",
    ", the cf wave functions are expected to capture the short - distance behavior of the composite - fermi sea state but may not to be very useful for subtleties associated with the low - energy long - distance physics ; unlike the fqhe states , the composite fermi - sea is likely to be susceptible to perturbations due to the absence of a gap .",
    "fortunately , however , we will see that it is not necessary to go all the way to 1/2 to see fermi - sea - like correlations ; they are manifest even in incompressible fqhe states away from 1/2 , indicating that a composite - fermi - sea description of the half - filled ll state is valid , at least as a first order description .",
    "the issues concerning subtle and asymptotic deviations from a _ perfect _ fermi liquid , which can surely be expected given that there was no reason to expect any kind of fermi sea in the first place , are beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "another widely used approach for an investigation of the cf state is based on a chern - simons field theory @xcite , useful for a description of the low - energy long - distance physics of the compressible composite - fermi sea at @xmath3 , which has been found to be reasonably stable against perturbations @xcite .",
    "the complementary approach of the present work provides support to this conclusion .",

    "we will employ the spherical geometry in which @xmath33 electrons move on the two - dimensional surface of a sphere @xcite under the influence of a radial magnetic field @xmath34 originating from a magnetic monopole of strength @xmath35 at the center , which corresponds to a total flux of @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the flux quantum .",
    "an ideal limit of zero transverse width , no disorder , vanishing ll mixing , and fully - polarized electrons will be assumed , allowing us to consider spinless electrons confined to the lowest ll moving on a disorderfree two - dimensional surface .",

    "we now compute @xmath4 and @xmath5 for composite fermions .",
    "the former is given by the probability of finding a pair of composite fermions at a distance @xmath6 , while the latter is related to the equal time density - density correlation function for composite fermions .",
    "since the positions and the density operator are the same for electrons and composite fermions , @xmath4 and @xmath5 for composite fermions are the same as those of electrons , with the expectation values evaluated in the cf wave functions .",
    "two strategies will be employed for approaching the composite fermi sea state . in one ,",
    "we will obtain thermodynamic estimates for @xmath4 and @xmath5 for fqhe states at @xmath1 for @xmath75 , a result interesting in its own right , and look for systematic behavior leading to the composite fermi sea , obtained in the limit @xmath15 .",

    "the cf wave functions have been tested for 2/5 , 3/7 , 2/3 , and 3/5 for systems of up to 12 particles , and the energies have been found to be very accurate @xcite .",
    "we note that the cf state at @xmath81 is identical to the laughlin state @xcite , and that the non - interacting electron wave function @xmath43 becomes the fermi sea state in the limit of @xmath82",
    ".    the second approach will be to increase the number of particles while staying at a vanishing effective magnetic field of composite fermions .",
    "zero effective flux ( @xmath83 ) implies @xmath84 giving the compressible fermi sea state @xmath85 in the limit @xmath79 .",

    "we will consider only the  filled shell \" systems with @xmath86 , because the ground state here is a single slater determinant , making computations easier , and also because it is spatially uniform ( with @xmath87 ) making @xmath88 a function of @xmath89 alone .",

    "( [ gr ] ) is used for a monte carlo evaluation of the pair - correlation function of composite fermions , with the distance @xmath6 defined to be the arch distance between the electrons .",
    "we have carried out a systematic study as a function of @xmath33 for fqhe states at @xmath1 for @xmath75 .",
    "[ fig : fs_fig2 ] shows @xmath4 for the largest system studied at each fractions @xcite .",
    "there is no appreciable @xmath33 dependence for 1/3 to 4/19 , and also for 5/11 and 6/13 except for the last oscillation .",
    "[ fig : fs_fig3 ] shows @xmath4 for @xmath83 cf states for up to 36 particles .",
    "the result for 9 particles is virtually indistinguishable from that obtained by exact diagonalization @xcite , not surprising given that the cf wave function has a large overlap ( 0.99938 @xcite ) with the exact ground state .",
    "it is illuminating to contrast the oscillations in @xmath4 of the fqhe and the zero - effective - flux states with the @xmath4 of a filled fermi sea , as done in figs .",
    "[ fig : fs_fig4 ] and [ fig : fs_fig5 ] . an evolution into a fermi - sea - like state",
    "is evident upon moving to larger values of @xmath13 along the @xmath92 fqhe states , or upon increasing @xmath33 at zero effective flux , strongly indicating the presence of a fermi - sea - like state at @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , the lls of composite fermions bear a closer resemblance to a fermi sea than do the lls of electrons in two respects . first",
    ", more oscillations occur ; for example , two peaks can be seen right at 1/3 , the state with one filled ll of composite fermions , in contrast to the one filled ll of electrons , the @xmath4 of which does not have any oscillations .",
    "second , the peak positions are much better correlated with those of the fermi sea in figs . [",
    "fig : fs_fig4 ] and [ fig : fs_fig5 ] than in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs_fig1 ] .",
    "this implies that the formation of electron lls is a stronger perturbation on the fermi sea of electrons than the formation of cf - lls is on the fermi sea of composite fermions , or in other words , that the fermi sea of composite fermions is quite robust .    for a more quantitative analysis of the numerical results we investigate the behavior of @xmath4 at large @xmath6 . for the fqhe",
    "states the oscillations are suppressed beyond a certain distance , as evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs_fig4 ] for 1/3 , 2/5 , 3/7 , and 4/9 , as expected from the presence of a gap in these systems .",
    "we are interested in the power law fall off of @xmath4 in the composite - fermi - sea state . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs_fig4 ] , the first few oscillations do not change substantially as one goes from 4/9 to 5/11 to 6/13 .",
    "therefore , we attempt to estimate the @xmath4 of the composite fermi sea by fitting the first few oscillations by the function @xmath93 which provides a reasonable approximation to the actual @xmath4 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : fs_fig6 ] for a typical example . in all cases , we find that @xmath94 is close to 2 ( equal to 2 within the uncertainty in the fit ) , as anticipated in the above discussion .",
    "the presence of these @xmath95 oscillations and a power - law decay of the amplitude again provides a clear evidence for the existence of a fermi sea of composite fermions .",
    "the exponent @xmath96 is found to be smaller than 3 but larger than 2 ( recall that @xmath97 for the non - interacting fermi sea ) ; its value depends somewhat on the range over which the fit is attempted , so should not be taken literally .",
    "it is natural to ask if the pair correlation function of composite fermions looks like that of some kind of _ interacting _ electron liquid at zero magnetic field .",
    "interacting fermion states are often described by jastrow wave functions ; to make the analogy to composite fermions as close as possible , we try the following jastrow wave function for _ interacting _ electrons at zero magnetic field : @xmath98 the pair correlation function of this state is precisely that of the _ unprojected _ composite fermion wave function at @xmath3 .",
    "motivated by this , we have computed @xmath4 for the unprojected cf state at @xmath99 , also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs_fig6 ] .",
    "while it is qualitatively similar to the @xmath4 of the projected cf wave function , or also to the @xmath4 of the non - interacting fermi sea , its decay is best fit by @xmath100 .",
    "two conclusions may be drawn : ( i ) it may indeed be possible to find some wave function of interacting electrons at zero magnetic field , possibly of the form @xmath101 which would behave similar to composite fermions insofar as the pair correlation function is concerned .",
    "( ii ) the exponent @xmath96 is not universal ; it depends on perturbations , e.g. , ll mixing ( since the unprojected cf wave function simulates ll mixing to an extent @xcite ) .      in the spherical geometry ,",
    "the total angular momentum @xmath102 replaces the wave vector , and spherical harmonics are used to define fourier transforms .",
    "the static structure factor is given by ( for @xmath103 ) @xmath104 where the @xmath105 component of @xmath102 is taken to be zero without any loss of generality .",
    "the relation @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the radius of the sphere in units of the magnetic length , will be used to present the results as a function of the wave vector @xmath29 .",
    "the static structure function can be computed either directly from the wave function , or by a fourier transform of @xmath4 .",
    "we have confirmed that both are in agreement ; below we give results obtained by a monte carlo evaluation of @xmath5 from the above equation .",
    "the static structure factors for the systems of fig .",
    "[ fig : fs_fig2 ] and [ fig : fs_fig3 ] are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : fs_fig7 ] and [ fig : fs_fig8 ] .",
    "two aspects are noteworthy : @xmath5 are all quite similar , even for particles as few as @xmath108 , and contain a sharp structure at @xmath31 , also reported by haldane @xcite .",
    "it would be of interest to know if there is a real cusp at @xmath31 .",
    "this is related to the exponent @xmath96 characterizing the power - law fall off of @xmath4 . a value of @xmath109 would produce a cusp in @xmath5 , as seen by noting that the fourier transform of @xmath110 is equal to @xmath111 for @xmath112 and arccosec@xmath113 for @xmath114 . however , no cusp will occur for @xmath115 , suggesting that there may not be a real cusp in @xmath5 at @xmath31 but only a sharp peak .",
    "the situation is complicated by the fact that only discrete points are available for @xmath5 .",
    "the dynamic susceptibility @xmath116 of composite fermions has been considered within the framework of the chern - simons description in ref .",
    "@xcite , which finds a divergent behavior as @xmath117 at @xmath31 , but ordinary fermi - liquid type behavior away from @xmath31 .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with our results , as a divergence in @xmath21 will produce an enhancement of @xmath5 at wave vectors below , but close to @xmath0 , while for @xmath114 , @xmath5 would revert back to fermi - sea like behavior",
    ". however , the divergence found in @xcite is rather weak , and further analysis of this issue will be useful .",
    "using a modified variational wave function which is easily projected onto the lowest landau level , we have computed the pair correlation function and the static structure factor for composite fermions , and found clear evidence for fermi - sea - like correlations in the vicinity of the half - filled ll , making a compelling case for the existence of a fermi sea of composite fermions at @xmath3 .",
