    "rare b meson decays constitute one of the most important classes of decays since they are induced by flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) at loop level in the standard model ( sm ) .",

    "these decays are also sensitive to the new physics beyond the sm , such as two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) @xcite , etc .    among the rare b meson decays , the exclusive @xmath6 decay has received considerable interest in view of the planned experiments at the upcoming kek and slac - b factories and existing hadronic accelerators , which may measure the branching ratios ( @xmath7 ) as low as @xmath8 . since the @xmath9 decay has two photon system , it is possible to study the cp violating effects @xcite and it can be easily detected in the experiments by putting a cut for the energy of final photons @xcite .",
