    "human face conveys various biometric traits , such as gender , age , ethnicity , and expression , in which the estimations of face - based gender and/or age have attracted increasing attentions due to their wide real - world applicability in recommendation systems @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , security access control @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , biometrics @xcite , @xcite , entertainment @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and cosmetology @xcite , @xcite , etc .",
    "therefore , in this work , we concentrate on the problem of joint estimation for human gender and age .",
    "note that the proposed joint learning methods can act as a pioneering reference to develop methodologies for other joint estimations , e.g. , age / expression joint estimation .",
    "* gender classification * is usually handled as a typical binary classification problem and implemented using off - the - shelf binary classifiers , such as the neural networks based methods @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , the svm - based methods @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the boosting - related approaches @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , bayesian classifier @xcite , random forest based method @xcite , etc . besides the above representative methods , there have been other types of methods proposed for gender classification ( see @xcite ) .",
    "* age estimation * is relatively more challenging to evaluate , compared to the binary gender recognition , due to its multi - class characteristic , especially the ordinality in value . as a result , researchers have paid more attention on it and proposed a variety of methods .",
    "these methods can be roughly categorized into three families : classification - based ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , regression - based ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and their hybrid methods ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . when we treat each age as a generic class and",
    "thus we can perform age estimation using the multi - class classification framework . along this line , the artificial neural networks ( ann ) @xcite , conditional probability neural networks ( cpnn ) @xcite , gaussian mixture models @xcite , and extreme learning machines ( elm ) @xcite have been successively employed to age estimation .",
    "more recently , @xcite proposed to perform age classification by eliminating the variance of expressions . and",
    ", @xcite incorporated facial dynamics together with the facial appearance information for age estimation .",
    "actually , age estimation is more of a regression rather than classification problem due to its natural characteristics of continuity and monotonicity in aging . along this line",
    ", the quadratic function @xcite , @xcite , multiple linear regression @xcite , @xmath0-svr @xcite , sdp regressors @xcite , aging pattern subspace ( ages ) @xcite , multi - instance regressor @xcite , and knn - svr @xcite have been proposed to perform human age regression . besides the separate classification or regression based methods",
    ", @xcite established a so - called locally adjusted robust regression ( larr ) by assembling a series of classifiers and regressors , and obtained more competitive age estimation results .",
    "* joint estimation of human gender and age * is to estimate human gender and age jointly , apart from aforementioned separate ( or say single ) gender classification and age estimation . in real world applications",
    ", there is usually a requirement of joint prediction for human gender and age , where the gender information as well as the age of a potential customer is desired in such applications as commodity recommendation @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . to this end , @xcite and",
    "@xcite employed the off - the - shelf partial least squares ( pls ) , a kind of multi - output regressor , to make joint estimation for gender and age , as well as the ethnicity .",
    "and on the morph ii aging database , they obtained preferable estimation results .",
    "however , the pls is just a generic off - the - shelf regressor , which has not definitely considered the underlying relationship between the gender and age , as claimed in @xcite , @xcite , and what is worse is that the semantic discrepancy between the gender and age is not reflected between the responses of the pls .",
    "in addition , to perform feature selection for age estimation , @xcite adopted the multi - task learning framework by taking male - oriented and female - oriented age estimations as two tasks and enforcing group - lasso for group feature selection , provided that the gender labels of training data are known .",
    "although on aging datasets like fg - net they obtained competitive results based on the selected feature subset , it is essentially a pseudo - joint method , i.e. , the gender information is just used as auxiliary for age estimation , since that it makes estimation just for human age rather than the gender and age together , leading to the ignorance of their mutual relationship , and that its two - step strategy ( i.e. , _ multi - task based feature selection _ and then _ ridge regression based age estimation _ ) is practically complex and time - consuming .",
    "besides , @xcite adopted the highly - nonlinear convolutional networks to optimize the loss functions of gender , age and ethnicity jointly with sharing the same deep convolutional network structures , and on the morph ii dataset obtained more competitive estimation results .",
    "however , the work of @xcite just shares a common deep network learning structure without considering the inherent interactive semantic relationship between the gender and age , since in which the loss functions with respect to the gender and age are just simply accumulated together for optimization without coupling terms .    to overcome the drawbacks of the methods aforementioned , in this work we propose a general joint learning framework for human gender and age , in which gender estimation is took as a binary classification and age prediction as an ordinal regression problem .",
    "more crucially , as a key ingredient of reflecting the semantic discrepancy between human gender and age , the underlying relationship between their semantic spaces is formulated as a near - orthogonality regularizer and incorporated to regularize the learning . in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework",
    ", we exemplify it by respectively taking the widely used binary - class svm for gender classification , and the discriminant learning for ordinal regression / support vector ordinal regression for age estimation , and particularly coupling them with the proposed regularization manner .",
    "then we kernelize the joint learning strategy by deriving a representer theorem and using kernel trick .",
    "finally , through extensive experiments on three real - world aging datasets , we demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed joint learning strategy , compared to related methods . and to provide an intuitive illustration about the superiority of the proposed joint learning strategy over existing methods in terms of estimation for human gender and age , we compare them in table [ tab : drawbacks - of - existing - methods ] .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : related work ] , we make a brief review for related works .",
    "then , we propose our methodology for joint estimation of human gender and age in section [ sec : proposed - methodology ] . in section",
    "[ sec : experiment ] , we conduct estimation experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed strategy . finally , we conclude this paper in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "before presenting our methodology , in this section we briefly review some works mostly related to joint estimation for human gender and age .      in order to conduct joint age estimation for males and females with feature selection",
    ", @xcite adopted the multi - task framework regularized with the group - lasso strategy @xcite by taking male - oriented and female - oriented age estimations as two tasks . more specifically , for a given training set @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the @xmath4-th @xmath5-dimensional instance and its label from the @xmath6-th task , respectively , they performed joint age estimation for males and females through using the off - the - shelf multi - task feature selection learning which is formulated as @xmath7 } \\ ; \\frac{1}{\\sum_{t=1}^{2}n_{t}}\\sum_{t=1}^{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_{t}}\\|y_{i}^{t } - ( w^{t})^{t } x_{i}^{t}\\|_{2}^{2 } + \\lambda\\sum_{d=1}^{d}\\|w_{d}\\|_{2 } , \\end{split }      $ } \\ ] ] where @xmath8 \\in \\mathcal{r}^{d\\times2}$ ] consists of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 which respectively represent the projection weights for the two tasks ( corresponding to the male - oriented and female - oriented age estimations ) , and the second term in is the well - known group - lasso regularization and is usually used for joint feature selection among the tasks .",
    "taking the selected features learned by as new feature representation , liang et al .",
    "uniformly adopted the ridge regression ( rr ) to perform age regression for the males and females , and obtained better results than single - task based methods @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .      strictly speaking ,",
    "one typical work for joint estimation of human gender and age is the one performed by @xcite and @xcite , where a popular multi - output regressor , i.e. , the pls , was employed for the joint estimation . and",
    "on a large aging dataset , morph ii , they obtained competitive prediction results for gender , age as well as ethnicity .",
    "as for pls , it is a typical multi - output regressor which can model the mapping from the input features to the responses .",
    "more concretely , for given input matrix @xmath11 and output response matrix @xmath12 ( whose each response vector is concatenated from the multi - output variables , e.g. , the gender and age ) , both of which are centered with zero - means , the pls aims to compute two weight vectors , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , to maximize the following covariance @xmath15 where @xmath16 represents the covariance between the score vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "regressions can then be performed for both @xmath11 and @xmath12 based on the score vectors @xmath6 and @xmath19 computed by optimizing the , such that @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are called loading vectors , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the regression residuals of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "then , based on , we can compute a sequence of score and loading vectors to make the regression residuals small enough as @xmath25 according to the regression relationships between the loading vectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( @xcite ) , we have @xmath28 where @xmath29 , and @xmath30 stands for the regression residual . actually ,",
    "if the number @xmath31 of iterations is properly assigned , the residual @xmath30 can be omitted for practical applicability .",
    "+   + * remark : * it can be found from section [ sec : relatedwork - multitask ] that in the multi - task based age estimation , the gender information is just used as auxiliary to help select features for consequent age estimation , rather than estimated jointly with age . therefore , it is essentially not a real joint method . as for the pls",
    "based joint method reviewed in section [ sec : relatedwork - pls ] , when it is directly employed to perform joint estimation for human gender and age as in @xcite and @xcite , its two - dimensional output indicates the regressed gender and age results , respectively .",
    "however , by this way the heterogenicity between the discrete binaryness of gender and the continuous ordinality of age is seriously destroyed .",
    "in addition , as mentioned in section [ sec : introduction ] and demonstrated in table [ tab : drawbacks - of - existing - methods ] , neither the multi - task based ( see section [ sec : relatedwork - multitask ] ) nor the pls - based ( see section [ sec : relatedwork - pls ] ) method has respected the ordinal characteristic of human age , or the semantic discrepancy between human gender and age . consequently , their estimation results are sub - optimal and a more preferable joint estimation strategy for human gender and age is desired .",
    "in this section , we firstly attempt to propose a general learning framework for joint estimation of human gender and age , in which the binaryness of human gender and ordinality of human age are both considered , and in particular , the semantic difference relationship between the human gender and age is exploited and modeled to improve their estimations .",
    "then , we come to exemplify the framework for the following empirical evaluation .       indicates the discriminant direction for gender ( from females to males ) , while the @xmath32 represents the age regression direction ( from younger to elder ) .,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "+    now consider the situation that there is a set of human face samples associated with gender labels and age annotations , what we need do is to train a joint estimator in terms of the gender and age using the training set .",
    "for the sake of clarification , as illustrated in figure [ fig : illustration_of_joint ] , we let @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote the gender discriminant and age regression directions , respectively . in order to make the samples separated respectively on the negative and positive sub - axes along the @xmath33 in terms of gender label ,",
    "while in positive ( for male ) or negative ( for female ) sub - axis of @xmath33 the instances distributed ordinal along the @xmath32 with respect to the age value , the @xmath33 and @xmath32 should be generally located as orthogonal as possible to each other , as illustrated in figure [ fig : illustration_of_joint ] . by this way , gender classification along the @xmath33 and age estimation along the @xmath32 can be performed nearly without mutual collision , and more importantly , the semantic discrepancy between the gender and the age can be eliminated from each other in their individual discriminant or regression direction .",
    "that is , the gender can be classified along the @xmath33 without the need of considering the age variations , and vice versa . as a result",
    ", the estimation accuracy of gender classification and age regression can be improved . for simplicity of constructing a joint learning framework in terms of human gender and age",
    ", we mathematically formulate learning in such _ nearly orthogonal semantic spaces _ ( nosspaces ) as a regularization term @xmath34 clearly , according to the above analysis the @xmath35 should be as small as possible to achieve the desired joint estimation for the gender and age , as illustrated in figure [ fig : illustration_of_joint ] .    with the proposed joint learning regularization term @xmath35 , we come to propose a general joint learning framework for human gender classification and age estimation as @xmath36 where @xmath37 refers to binary classification loss function in terms of gender classification , e.g. , the widely used _",
    "hinge loss function _",
    "@xcite , @xmath38 refers to the empirical loss of age regression , such as _ squares loss _",
    "@xcite , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are trade - off parameters to balance the loss functions and regularizations .",
    "obviously , by imposing the near orthogonality penalty on the semantic spaces , gender classification and age regression can be learned jointly with specially considering their semantic relationships .    _ it is worth noting that _    1 .",
    "although the formulation is in form seemingly trivial , to the best of our knowledge , it is the first work in specifically exploring the semantic relationship between human gender and age . 2 .",
    "the nosspaces is similar _ in spirit _ to but different _ in essence _ from generic multi - task learning , because that in multi - task learning , different tasks are exclusively trained on their respective training data without data sharing , while in our framework the gender classification and age estimation are performed based on the same training data .",
    "more importantly , the formulation of nosspaces is relatively more concise than most of the multi - task learning methods .",
    "3 .   in theory",
    ", while there may be other strategies that can capture the semantic relationships between human gender and age , our joint learning methodology formulated in eq .",
    "is concise and easy - to - implement , and more importantly , we later will experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority over related methods .      in order to evaluate the proposed framework and without loss of generality ,",
    "we exemplify eq . by taking the widely used binary - class svm for gender classification , while the discriminant learning for ordinal regression ( kdlor ) and support vector ordinal regression ( svor ) for age estimation , respectively .",
    "+      with the proposed joint learning framework , we construct the first exemplified joint estimation model by respectively substituting the @xmath42 and the @xmath43 with the widely used binary svm and the discriminant learning for ordinal regression ( kdlor ) @xcite as @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the number of samples used for training in gender classification , @xmath33 and @xmath46 , respectively , denote the weight vector and intercept for gender classification , @xmath47 denote the @xmath4-th instance and corresponding gender label of @xmath45 samples , @xmath32 denotes the weight vector for age estimation , @xmath48 stands for the within - class scatter with @xmath49 being the total number of training samples of @xmath50 classes , @xmath51 the training samples set of the @xmath31-th class , and @xmath52 the mean vector of the @xmath31-th class , @xmath53 is interval margin between the classes , and @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are non - negative hyper - parameters .    due to the bi - convexity of with respect to @xmath57 and @xmath58 ,",
    "i.e. , it is convex with respect to @xmath57 with fixed @xmath58 , and vice versa .",
    "therefore , we can take an alternative strategy to solve @xmath59 . more specifically , for fixed @xmath32 , then becomes @xmath60 which is equivalent to @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the identity matrix of proper size .",
    "the sub - problem is convex and can be similarly solved by the same way for svm @xcite .",
    "when the @xmath33 and @xmath46 are solved by or , then they are constant and we come to optimize with respect to @xmath58 as @xmath63 which in form is equivalent to @xmath64    eq . in form",
    "is quite similar to the primal problem of kdlor , and thus can be solved similarly as in @xcite .    by alternating between and until convergence ,",
    "we can obtain the final solution for @xmath33 , @xmath46 , @xmath32 , and @xmath65 .",
    "and we summarize the complete procedure for joint svm and kdlor in table [ tab : algorithm svm - kdlor ] .    using the @xmath33 , @xmath46 , and @xmath32 solved by the algorithm in table [ tab : algorithm svm - kdlor ]",
    ", we can fulfil the goal of making joint estimation for human gender and age in the nosspaces . +      in order to evaluate the general feasibility of the proposed joint learning framework . besides the kdlor",
    ", we also adopt the support vector ordinal regression ( svor ) @xcite method , a well - known ordinal regression method , for age estimation .",
    "and we can construct the corresponding joint model by substituting the formulations of svm and svor into as @xmath66 where @xmath33 and @xmath46 , respectively , denote the weight vector and intercept for gender classification , @xmath67 denote the @xmath4-th instance and corresponding gender label of @xmath45 samples , @xmath32 and @xmath65 , respectively , denote the weight vector and intercept for age estimation , @xmath68 stands for the @xmath4-th instance from the @xmath69-th age of totally @xmath50 ages , @xmath70 represent the slack variables , @xmath71 are the thresholds of svor to be optimized , and @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are also non - negative trade - off parameters .    clearly , the formulation is also bi - convex with respect to @xmath72 and @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , we also take the alternative optimization to solve it .",
    "more precisely , for fixed @xmath72 , the becomes @xmath73 which is equivalent to @xmath74 where @xmath62 is the identity matrix of proper size .",
    "the sub - problem is convex and can be similarly solved by the same way for svm @xcite . then , when the @xmath57 are obtained and fixed , the problem becomes @xmath75 or equivalently , @xmath76 which is the same in form as the problem ( 5 ) of @xcite , and can be similarly solved as in the literature .    to obtain the final @xmath77 , we repeat the alternative optimization process between and until convergence , and summarize the algorithm in table [ tab : algorithm svm - svor ] .",
    "when the @xmath33 , @xmath46 , @xmath32 , and @xmath65 are obtained by the algorithm listed in table [ tab : algorithm svm - svor ] , we can make predictions for human gender and age .",
    "in real applications , usually the associated data are not linearly separable . in order to handle such applications",
    ", we need to extend the joint learning framework in eq . to higher - dimensional nonlinear spaces . before that",
    ", we firstly give the specific representer theorem for the @xmath78 and @xmath79 involved in the joint learning framework as below .    [ theorem : nosspaces - representation ] the @xmath78 and @xmath79 in eq .",
    "can be respectively expressed as a linear combination of training samples as @xmath80 and @xmath81 , with @xmath82 and @xmath83 being the combination coefficients and @xmath84 the feature mapping function defined on training samples @xmath85 .",
    "( see the for the proof . )",
    "according to theorem [ theorem : nosspaces - representation ] , the @xmath78 and @xmath79 can be respectively expressed as a combination of the training samples : @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and then nosspaces in eq . can be mapped into the nonlinear feature space with kernel trick and expressed as @xmath88 where @xmath89 stands for the kernel matrix with @xmath90 .      with theorem [ theorem : nosspaces - representation ] , the joint learning models in eq .",
    "can be reformulated in the nonlinear nosspaces as @xmath91 with the assumption that the training samples have been centralized within each class beforehand , and @xmath92 represents the @xmath4-th column of the total kernel matrix @xmath89 , and @xmath93 stands for the sub - block kernel matrix between the @xmath31-th class samples and the entire training set , i.e. , it is a sub - matrix of the @xmath89 .",
    "similarly , the joint svm and svor in eq . can be transformed into the form as @xmath94 where @xmath95 denotes the @xmath4-th column of the @xmath96 , where the meaning of @xmath96 is the same as in eq . .",
    "by comparing the forms of eqs with , with , respectively , it can be found that their forms are correspondingly similar , and thus the models in eqs . and can be solved similarly according to the algorithms summarized in tables [ tab : algorithm svm - kdlor ] and [ tab : algorithm svm - svor ] , respectively .",
    "in this section , we conduct experiments to evaluate the proposed strategy on three benchmark aging datasets , respectively .      in the experiments , we make evaluations of the proposed methods on three well - known aging datasets , fg - net , morph album i , and morph album ii .",
    "the fg - net dataset consists of 1,002 facial images captured from 82 persons . in order to evaluate the proposed joint learning methods with respect to male and female age prediction",
    ", we select a subset of fg - net with age ranging from 0 to 36 years old , since that there are very few female samples older than 36 years . for the morph album",

    "<S> in human face - based biometrics , gender classification and age estimation are two typical learning tasks . </S>",
    "<S> although a variety of approaches have been proposed to handle them , just a few of them are solved jointly , even so , these joint methods do not yet specifically concern the semantic difference between human gender and age , which is intuitively helpful for joint learning , consequently leaving us a room of further improving the performance . to this end , in this work we firstly propose a general learning framework for jointly estimating human gender and age by specially attempting to formulate such semantic relationships as a form of near - orthogonality regularization and then incorporate it into the objective of the joint learning framework . in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework </S>",
    "<S> , we exemplify it by respectively taking the widely used binary - class svm for gender classification , and two threshold - based ordinal regression methods ( i.e. , the discriminant learning for ordinal regression and support vector ordinal regression ) for age estimation , and crucially coupling both through the proposed semantic formulation . moreover , we develop its kernelized nonlinear counterpart by deriving a representer theorem for the joint learning strategy . </S>",
    "<S> finally , through extensive experiments on three aging datasets fg - net , morph album i and morph album ii , we demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed joint learning strategy .    </S>",
