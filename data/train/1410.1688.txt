    "magnetic shape memory alloys ( msma ) are excellent candidates for technological applications due to their coupling between different degrees of freedom , such as caloric , magnetic , elastic etc . , that introduce multifunctionality in these materials . the magneto - structural coupling results in a phase transition between high temperature austenite structure and low temperature martensitic variants driven by magnetic field under ambient conditions .",
    "microscopically , this martensitic transformation is merely a consequence of reshuffling of atomic planes , which is often mediated through different periodically modulated meta - stable structures called premartensitic structure .",
    "very often , the microscopic origin behind the martensitic phase transformation can be explained by softening of some phonon modes , related to the softness in elastic stiffness constants caused by the nesting topology between parallel fermi surfaces due to intense electron - phonon coupling.this has been the case for almost all the ternary msma s crystallizing in heusler structure .",
    "the most extensively studied ternary msma is ni@xmath0mnga , which in single crystal environments and close to the stoichiometric composition , exhibit nearly 10@xmath3 magnetic field - induced strains ( mfis ) under a magnetic field of less than 1 tesla@xcite , making it a strong contender for micro - mechanical sensors and actuators . the structural instability of ni@xmath0mnga in the austenite phase has been linked with an anomalous phonon softening of transverse acoustic ta@xmath0 branch along [ @xmath4 direction .",
    "the softening occurs at a fractional wave vector @xmath5=(0.33,0.33,0 ) and it becomes more prominent as one approaches towards the martensitic phase with decreasing temperature@xcite . the phonon softening has been found to correlate with the premartensitic phase , which is anticipated by the precursor phonon softening at that wave vector .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering experiments and elastic constants measurements on the high temperature phase corroborated the theoretical calculations of softening of acoustic branch .",
    "a complete softening of acoustic ta@xmath0 branch along [ @xmath4 direction with unstable phonon modes was reported theoretically in ni@xmath0mnal@xcite .",
    "later , moya _ et al .",
    "_ verified the kohn anomaly observed in the theoretical study of ta@xmath0 branch in this material by performing inelastic neutron scattering experiment on nearly stoichiometric ni@xmath0mnal @xcite .",
    "however , the experimental softening is not complete since the phonon frequencies remain finite even at lowest temperature .",
    "this could be related to the fact that the composition needed for the martensitic phase transformation to occur in ni@xmath0mnal is slightly off - stoichiometric@xcite .",
    "first - principles calculations observed similar phonon softening of the same acoustic branch in ni@xmath0mnin , ni@xmath0mnsb , and ni@xmath0mnsn@xcite .",
    "although ni@xmath0mnga near the stoichiometric composition is the first discovered ternary system in heusler structure exhibiting magnetic shape memory effect , and has been studied extensively revealing a lot of interesting physics , its use in practical applications is hindered due to the martensitic transformation temperature being lower than the room temperature , and poor ductility in poly - crystalline phase @xcite .",
    "attempts were made to improve the functionality of the material by introducing disorder with various possibilities and replacing ga conjointly with al , ge , in , sn and sb . however , the yield is not as fruitful as expected .",
    "therefore , a quest for new msma began with higher operating temperatures and better elastic properties compared to ni@xmath0mn_x_. recently , mn@xmath0niga has been reported to be a msma with promising functional properties @xcite .",
    "it has a martensitic transformation temperature close to room temperature ( 270 k ) and much broader hysteresis loop @xcite .",
    "an excellent two - way shape memory effect with strains of 1.7@xmath3 and field controllable shape memory effect up to 4@xmath3 has been observed experimentally in single crystalline environment @xcite .",
    "experiments with poly - crystalline sample found the martensitic transformation temperature to be at 230 k @xcite .",
    "it also observed that the structural transformation is dependent upon residual stress . according to the analysis of their powder x - ray diffraction data , the system undergoes a martensitic transformation to either a non - modulated tetragonal structure or a monoclinic modulated structure at room temperature , depending upon the residual stress .",
    "neutron powder diffraction experiments on this system confirmed the presence of an orthorhombic modulated structure , which is independent of temperature @xcite .",
    "these results generated interests in this system in the context of understanding its structural stability and connections to shape memory effect .",
    "another reason is that this material draws attention due to its relatively high curie temperature ( t@xmath6 588 k ) @xcite compared to ni@xmath0mnga . in this respect , it is notable that mn@xmath0nisn also has a high t@xmath7 ( 530 k)@xcite .",
    "driven by the possibilities of realizing new msmas with functionalities better than the ni@xmath0mnx ones , first - principles electronic structure calculations have been done on mn@xmath0ni_x _ ( _",
    "x_= al , ga , in , sn ) systems @xcite .",
    "the results are quite encouraging as the total energy calculations predicted transformations from cubic austenite to a non - modulated tetragonal phase at low temperatures conserving the volume , a signature of shape - memory property .",
    "these results thus open up the possibility to further investigate the origin of such transformations and their consequences in these materials .    in this paper",
    ", we , therefore , make an attempt to understand the physical origin behind the transformations by examining the vibrational properties of these materials in a systematic way .",
    "we compute the phonon dispersion , the vibrational density of states , the elastic constants and the fermi surfaces in order to see whether connections to the martensitic transformations can be made for these materials .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we provide details of the computational methods used , in section iii , we discuss the phonon dispersion relations , the vibrational densities of states , the inter - atomic force constants , the elastic constants and the fermi surfaces in order to ascertain the mechanisms driving the martensitic transformations and finally we summarize our results indicating their relevance for future research .",

    "ultrasoft pseudo potentials ( uspp)@xcite were used to accurately calculate the electronic ground states .",

    "plane waves with energies up to 544 ev were used to describe electronic wave functions .",
    "fourier component of the augmented charge density with cut - off energy up to 6530 ev was taken after convergence tests .",
    "the brillouin zone integrations were carried out with finite temperature methfessel - paxton smearing@xcite method using 12@xmath812@xmath812 uniform @xmath9-mesh , which effectively leads to 364 @xmath9-points in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone .",
    "the value of the smearing parameter was taken as 0.27 ev .",
    "such choices of the parameters ensure the convergence of phonon frequencies within 5@xmath3 .",
    "the phonon dispersion relations were computed using density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt)@xcite . the dfpt scheme is employed to accurately calculate the dynamical properties in condensed matter systems with the precision at par with the electronic structure calculations .",
    "the energy threshold value for convergence was 10@xmath10 ry in phonon calculations .",
    "dynamical matrices were conveniently calculated in reciprocal space from the ground state charge density and from its linear response to the distortion in the ionic configurations .",
    "fourier transform was employed thereafter to obtain the real space force constants .",
    "the dynamical matrices were calculated in a 4@xmath84@xmath84 @xmath11-point grid for all the structures .",
    "convergence of phonon frequencies within @xmath12 was ensured by comparing frequencies calculated directly and frequencies obtained by the fourier transform of the dynamical matrices .",
    "such convergence tests ensured accuracy in elastic constants as they are calculated from the slopes of the phonon dispersion curves .",
    "the fermi surfaces were calculated on @xmath13 highly dense uniform @xmath9-point grid . it may be noted that the strength of the phonon anomaly is extremely sensitive to temperature .",
    "an increase in temperature can reduce the nesting features of fermi surfaces and thus weaken the anomaly . in dft based calculations , the smearing parameter @xmath14 plays the role of fictitious electronic temperature .",

    "the total energies as a function of lattice parameters were fitted to murnaghan equation of state to accurately calculate the equilibrium lattice constants .",

    "the phonon dispersion spectra calculated at those lattice constants along [ @xmath4 highly symmetric direction in the irreducible segment of the brillouin zone ( ibz ) are shown in fig .",

    ", this branch shows an anomalous behavior .",
    "therefore , our aim is to investigate the behavior of acoustic ta@xmath0 branch along [ @xmath4 direction .",
    "the most important features in the dispersion curves are the anomalous dips of the acoustic ta@xmath0 branches where the phonon frequencies become imaginary , suggesting instabilities in the cubic austenite structures which usher in a phase transition to stable martensitic phases in all four materials . in mn@xmath0niga and mn@xmath0nial ,",
    "the acoustic ta@xmath0 branches have negative slopes at @xmath17 point , indicating a pure elastic instability in their parent structure .",

    "for mn@xmath0niin , the instability of ta@xmath0 branch starts from @xmath5=0.3 producing maximum of the dip at wave vector @xmath5=0.50 . for mn@xmath0nisn , unlike the other materials , the softening extends up to the wedge of the brillouin zone with the maximum of the dip at @xmath5=0.50 .    in previous studies of lattice dynamics on ternary msmas with heusler structures ,",
    "phonon anomalies of ta@xmath0 were correlated with the precursor phenomenon prior to the martensitic phase when the systems are cooled from high temperatures .",
    "the wave vectors corresponding to the imaginary phonon frequencies indicated shuffling of atomic planes which stabilize the ( c / a)@xmath181 phases compared to the parent phase ( ( c / a)@xmath191 ) .",
    "the occurrence of 3 m , 5 m and 7 m modulated structures and even incommensurate structures were confirmed experimentally .",
    "possibilities of such modulated structures can be inferred from the anomalies in our calculated dispersion relations for mn@xmath0ni_x _ systems .",
    "a modulated structure with a periodicity of 8 atomic planes ( 2 m structure ) can be associated with an instability at @xmath5=0.25 , one with a periodicity of 6 atomic planes ( 3 m structure ) can be associated with an instability at @xmath5=0.33 and one with a shuffling of 14 atomic planes ( 7 m structure ) can be associated with an instability at @xmath5=0.29 . for mn@xmath0nial ,",
    "the unstable mode occurs for @xmath5=0.0 to @xmath5=0.35 with the maximum of the dip at @xmath5=0.25 .",
    "this suggests the possibilities of occurrence of several modulated phases . the commensurate wave vector closest to the maximum of the dip in the ta@xmath0 branch of of mn@xmath0niga occurs at @xmath5=0.33 which can be related to the occurrence of the 3 m structure .",
    "since , in mn@xmath0niga , the imaginary frequencies extends up to @xmath5=0.50 , in addition to aforementioned modulated structures 5 m , modulation can also be observed at @xmath5=0.43 which stabilizes with the shuffling of 10 atomic planes . in cases of mn@xmath0niin and mn@xmath0nisn",
    ", the maximum in the dip of the ta@xmath0 branch occurs at @xmath5=0.5 , which although can not be connected to the known modulated structures mentioned above , but the extent of the instabilities in these systems can be connected to the 3 m and 5 m modulations .",
    "these suggest possibilities of occurrence of new kinds of modulations leading to precursor phenomena in these materials or that there may be more complicated structures with co - existence of multiple modulated phases .",
    "signatures of 7 m modulated phases have been observed experimentally @xcite in mn@xmath0niga , but the occurrences of these were either dependent on the amount of stress in the system @xcite or on the sublattice occupancies @xcite .",
    "thus , no definite conclusion on the kind of modulation in this system and the resulting pre - martensitic structures can be made from the available experimental results . detailed systematic calculations on the non - cubic variants for these systems are to be carried out in order to settle the issue .",
    "however , this is beyond the aim and scope of the present study .",
    "energetically lowest optical t@xmath2 branch is raman active in nature with [ @xmath20 polarization and the other optical branches are infrared active with t@xmath21u symmetry .",
    "it is known that phonon branches with same symmetry would repel each other . since",
    ", acoustic ta@xmath0 branch also has same state of polarization ; it would be repelled by the t@xmath2 branches . in a previous theoretical study , zayak _",
    "_ @xcite argued that due to this repulsion the ta@xmath0 branch is pushed downward and becomes unstable . to prove this , they compared the position of t@xmath2 branches at @xmath17 point of some stable heusler alloys at cubic phase like co@xmath0mnga and co@xmath0mnge to unstable systems like ni@xmath0mn_x _ ( _ x _ = ga , ge , in , al ) and illustrated that energetically lowered t@xmath2 branches in the unstable alloys compared to those alloys with stable cubic phases , produce the necessary repulsive thrust to the lowest vibrational branch . the results in fig . 2 suggest the same explanation for the phonon instabilities in mn@xmath0ni_x_. the repulsion due to the already low lying t@xmath2 modes at the @xmath17 point for all four materials push the ta@xmath0 frequencies down setting up the unstable modes . in reference 30 , the authors attributed the occurrence of anomalous unstable modes in ni@xmath0mnga to the inversion of modes of ni and ga .",
    "they showed that the contributions to the t@xmath2 branches come from the dynamics of ni atoms and due to the inversion of optical modes , the ni atoms vibrate at lower frequencies making the frequencies of the t@xmath2 mode lower .",
    "the repulsion of ta@xmath0 modes by these t@xmath2 modes pull the frequencies of the former down making them imaginary .",
    "for the materials investigated here , an analysis of the vibrational amplitudes show that the t@xmath2 modes are dominated by the vibrations from ni and mni atoms who occupy crystallographic equivalent sites , and in fact the same ones as the two equivalent ni atoms in ni@xmath0mnga .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to examine whether such an inversion of optical mode is also happening for these materials . in the next subsection , we explore this by looking at the vibrational density of states ( vdos ) .",

    "it is observed that the vibrational contributions from two mn atoms occupy different frequency regions in the vdos plots .",
    "this occurs mainly because of the following reasons : the two mn atoms have different crystallographic symmetry ; the atom occupying ( 000 ) sub - lattice , labeled as mni , have tetrahedral symmetry and the other one at ( 0.25,0.25,0.25 ) , labeled as mnii , sub - lattice have octahedral symmetry ; as a consequence of this their nearest neighbor environments are different leading to different bond stiffness s ( force constants ) for the bonds connected to the mn atoms .",
    "a comparison of all the vdoss show that the vdoss of mn@xmath0niin and mn@xmath0nisn materials are quite similar and are very different from the vdoss of the other two materials in the series .",
    "3 suggests that for mn@xmath0niin and mn@xmath0nisn , vibrations of mni atoms are prominent between 6 thz to 7 thz , whereas contributions from mnii atoms are predominantly lie between 4.5 thz to 6 thz .",
    "due to the slightly larger atomic mass than mn atom , ni vibrations occur mostly between 2.5 thz to 4.5 thz .",
    "as expected , the lower frequency regions are dominated by in and sn because they have larger atomic masses than ni and mn . for mn@xmath0niga ,",
    "vibrations in the range 7 thz to 8 thz are mainly dominated by mni atom , while vibrations from 5.5 thz to 7 thz have contributions from mnii atoms .",
    "a strong peak originated from mni vibrations coinciding with a peak originating from vibrations of mnii atoms is also observed at 6 thz . in the frequency range 3 thz to 5 thz ,",
    "vibrations of ni atoms are predominant and the lowermost part of the spectrum is dominated by the vibrations of the ga atoms .",
    "the features in the vdos of mn@xmath0nial is different than the other three .",
    "the modes due to the vibrations of al atoms occur at around 10 thz due to extremely light mass of al",
    ". the ni modes also occur at lower frequencies , similar to the cases of the other three .",
    "the vibrations of mni and mnii atoms dominate the middle of the spectrum with their respective peaks at 6.25 thz and 7.3 thz . in case of ni@xmath0mnga ,",
    "zayak _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the positions of ga and ni contributions to the vdos were  inverted \" , that is , the vibrations of the lighter ni atoms were at frequencies lower than those of heavier ga atoms .",
    "they connected this anomalous mode inversion to the instability of the ta@xmath0 modes of ni@xmath0mnga . in case of the systems studied here ,",
    "the overall features in the vdoss of all four materials suggest that there is no signature of inversion of ni ( mni ) modes with those of the modes from the element _ x_. thus the occurrence of unstable ta@xmath0 modes can not be associated to this .",
    "ni_x _ materials.,width=321 ]    in order to understand the features in the vdos , we analyze the behavior of the real space inter - atomic force constants . in fig .",

    "the force constants between any pair of nearest neighbor atoms are nearly equal for mn@xmath0nial with mn@xmath0niga .",
    "same is true for mn@xmath0niin with mn@xmath0nisn .",
    "however , substantial changes in the force constants between any pairs are observed as one moves from mn@xmath0niga to mn@xmath0niin . due to the increase in the inter - atomic distances , as a result of expansion in their equilibrium lattice constants from 5.850   to 6.162 ",

    "this opposite behavior is observed since the sizes of the _ x _ elements for the former two alloys are larger than those in the latter two , and thus are able to overcome the expansion of the inter - atomic distances occurring in the former two as compared to the latter two .",
    "the nearest neighbor force constants associated to mnii atom , the mnii - ni and the mnii - mni , become softer as one moves from mn@xmath0niga to mn@xmath0niin and mn@xmath0nisn . therefore , vibration frequencies corresponding to mnii atoms would be lower in the latter two materials , which agree with the features in the vdos . in mn@xmath0niga ,",
    "vibrations of mnii extend from 5.5 thz to 7 thz , which in case of mn@xmath0niin and mn@xmath0nisn shift to lower frequencies , around 5.5 thz . the dynamical behavior of mni and ni atoms are more complicated . for both of the atoms , two sets of inter - atomic force",
    "constants behave opposite to one another . for ni , the ni-_x _ nearest neighbor force constants harden , as one goes from ga to in and sn .",

    "the figure clearly exhibits flat portions of both the minority bands",

    "the same is not true for the other two materials .",
    "although they satisfy equation ( 1 ) and have sizable c@xmath38 , their anisotropy ratios a are high enough to bring in a martensitic transformation @xcite .",
    "the elastic anisotropy ratio a ( = c@xmath40 ) is an important quantity to measure of stability of cubic structures under stress across ( @xmath39 ) planes @xcite .",
    "larger the value it acquires , more unstable the structure becomes . for systems undergoing martensitic transformations , the value of a varies from 2 onward @xcite . in cases of mn@xmath0niin and mn@xmath0nisn , the values of a lie well within the limits observed in shape memory alloys .",
    "the origin of this could be rather small value of the shear modulus c@xmath38 .",
    "additionally , we find that c@xmath28 in cases of mn@xmath0niin and mn@xmath0nisn are much softer than those for the other two materials . the comparative softening in c@xmath28 for mn@xmath0niin and mn@xmath0nisn as compared to mn@xmath0niga and mn@xmath0nial ,",
    "indicate that the cubic mn@xmath0niin and mn@xmath0nisn will transform to different martensitic phases compared to the other two where the transformations would be driven by softening in c@xmath38 as has been observed in cases of other shape memory alloys @xcite .",
    "the results on elastic constants therefore corroborate the inferences drawn from the differences in dispersion relations for the materials studied .",
    "the vibrational and elastic properties discussed in this work show a clear trend . mn@xmath0niga and mn@xmath0nial",
    "are quite similar in their behaviors ; same goes for mn@xmath0niin and mn@xmath0nisn .",
    "the vibrational and elastic properties among these two groups are significantly different .",
    "the origin of such differences can be traced back to the differences in their electronic structures @xcite .",
    "the signatures of mechanical instability were reflected in electronic structures of mn@xmath0niga and mn@xmath0nial , where high densities of states , as compared to mn@xmath0niin and mn@xmath0nisn , were found at the fermi level .",
    "the origin of this was larger hybridizations between the mn and ni atoms at the octahedral positions for the former two systems .",
    "for the latter two systems , rather small densities of states at fermi level , due to smaller hybridizations between the magnetic atoms at octahedral positions , originating from larger distances between those magnetic atoms ( due to the atoms sitting in a larger lattice compared to the former two which happens as in and sn have larger sizes than ga and al ) , signified that it would take external influences to induce instabilities into these systems .",
    "we have investigated the lattice dynamics of mn@xmath0ni_x _ ( _ x_= al , ga , in , sn ) msmas in their austenite phase using first - principles based density functional theory calculations .",
    "the calculated phonon spectra show anomalous behavior of the acoustic ta@xmath0 branch along [ @xmath4 direction for all the four materials indicating structural instability .",
    "instabilities in the said acoustic mode can be related to the repulsion by the optical t@xmath2 mode having the same symmetry as the ta@xmath0 mode . unlike ni@xmath0mnga , no inversion of optical modes could be observed , thus ruling this out as one of the possible mechanisms behind the anomalous features in phonon spectra .",
    "the features in the vibrational densities of states can be explained from the qualitative variations of the interatomic force constants across the materials .",
    "the calculated elastic constants corroborate the structural instabilities inferred from phonon dispersion relations .",
    "negative shear constants for mn@xmath0nial and mn@xmath0niga indicate pure elastic instabilities in these materials . finally , the nesting features in the fermi surfaces confirm that the observed phonon anomalies are associated with them",
    ". the wave vectors at which the maximum anomaly occur indicate the possibility of formation of pre - martensitic modulated phases which are yet to be confirmed by experiments . the results also indicate that these modulated pre - martensitic phases could be quite complex and further investigations into this aspect is necessary .",
