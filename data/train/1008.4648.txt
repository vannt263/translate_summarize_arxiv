    "unique properties of graphene layers , graphene nanoribbon arrays and graphene bilayers  @xcite as well as graphene nanomeshs  @xcite make them promising for different nanoelectronic device applications .",

    "however , the gapless energy spectrum of gls is an obstacle for creating transistor digital circuits based on graphene field - effect transistors ( g - fets ) due to relatively strong interband tunneling in the fet off - state  @xcite .",
    "the reinstatement of the energy gap in graphene - based structures like graphene nanoribbons , graphene nanomeshs , and graphene bilayers appears to be unavoidable to fabricate fets with a sufficiently large on / off ratio .",
    "recently , the device dc and ac characteristics of graphene nanoribbon and graphene bilayer fets ( which are referred to as gnr - fets and gbl - fets , respectively ) were assessed both numerically and analytically  @xcite .",
    "the device characteristics of gnr - fets operating in near ballistic and drift - diffusion regimes can be calculated analogously with those of nanowire- and carbon nanotube - fets ( see , for instance  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the gbl - fet characteristics can , in principle , be found using the same approaches as those realized previously for more customary fets with a two - dimensional electron system in the channel  @xcite .",

    ", we use a substantially generalized version of the gbl - fet analytical device model  @xcite to calculate the characteristics of gbl - fets ( the threshold voltages , current - voltage characteristics , and transconductance ) in different regimes and analyze the possibility of a significant improvement of the ultimate performance of these fets by shortening of the gate and decreasing of the gate layer thickness .",
    "the device model under consideration , which presents the gbl - fet characteristics in closed analytical form , allows a simple and clear evaluation of the ultimate performance of gbl - fets and their comparison .",
    "the following effects are considered : ( a ) dependences of the electron density and energy gap in different sections of the channel on the applied voltages and the inversion of the gated section charge ; ( b ) degeneracy of the electron system , particularly , in the source and drain sections of the channel ; ( c ) the short - gate effect and the effect of drain - induced barrier lowering ; ( d ) electron scattering in the channel .",
    "our model is based on the boltzmann kinetic equation for the electron system in the gbl - fet and the poisson equation in the weak nonlocality approximation  @xcite .",
    "the use of the latter allows us to find the potential distributions along the channel in the most interesting cases and obtain the gbl - fet characteristics analytically .",

    "the general formulas for the source - drain current and the gbl - fet transconductance simplified for the limiting cases ( far below the threshold , near threshold , and at low top - gate voltages corresponding to the on - state ) are also presented . in this section ,",
    "the source - drain current and the gbl - fet transconductance are expressed in terms of the fermi energy in the source and drain contacts and the height of the potential barrier in the channel . to find the barrier height , the poisson equation is solved for different limiting cases in sec .",
    "the obtained potential distributions are used for the derivation of the explicit formulas for source - drain current and the transconductance as functions of the applied voltages and geometrical parameters . section  v deals with a brief discussion of some effects ( role of the device geometry , electron scattering , charge inversion in the channel , and interband tunneling ) , which influence the gbl - fet characteristics . in sec .",
    "vi , we draw the main conclusions .",
    "some reference data related to the voltage dependences of the fermi energy and the energy gap in different sections of the gbl - fet channel are singled out to the appendix .",
    "[ fig1 ]    we consider a gbl - fet with the structure shown in fig .",
    "it is assumed that the back gate , which is positively biased by the pertinent voltage @xmath0 , provides the formation of the electron channel in the gbl between the ohmic source and drain contacts .",
    "a relatively short top gate serves to control the source - drain current by forming the potential barrier ( its height @xmath1 depends on the top gate voltage @xmath2 and other voltages ) for the electrons propagating between the contacts .",
    "we shall assume that the gbl - fets under the conditions when the electron systems in the source and drain sections are degenerate , i.e. , @xmath3 .",
    "this implies that the back gate voltage is sufficiently high to induce necessary electron density in the source and drain sections .    in the gbl - fet the energy gap",
    "is electrically induced by the back gate voltage  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "thus in gbl - fets , the back gate plays the dual role : it provides the formation of the electron channel and the energy gap . since the electric field component directed perpendicular to the gbl plane in the channel section below the top gate ( gated section )",

    "the cases @xmath15 and @xmath16 correspond to the alignment of the fermi level in the source section of the channel with the conduction band bottom and the valence band top , respectively , in the gated section .",

    "the parameters @xmath132 and @xmath159 characterizing the strength of these effects in the cases of essentially depleted channel and strong screening were expressed via the geometrical parameters and the bohr radius .",
    "as shown , the gbl - fet transconductance exhibits a pronounced maximum as a function of the top - gate voltage swing .",
    "the interplay of the short - gate effect and the electron collisions results in a nonmonotonic dependence of the transconductance on the top - gate length .",
