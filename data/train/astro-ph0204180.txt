    "young massive ob stars significantly influence the structure , dynamics , chemistry and thermal balance of their associated molecular clouds through the impact of their ultraviolet photons .",
    "their extreme ultraviolet photons ( euv , @xmath11 13.6 ev ) ionize the gas immediately surrounding them , forming regions . far ultraviolet photons ( fuv , 6 ev @xmath12 13.6 ev ) dissociate molecular gas beyond the region , creating a photodissociation region or pdr ( hollenbach & tielens 1999 ) .",
    "pdrs are ubiquitous : fuv photons dominate the gas heating in pdrs and affect the chemistry and physics of gas over a large fraction of the volume and mass of molecular clouds .",
    "the study of interactions between fuv radiation and molecular cloud gas is therefore important in understanding molecular cloud evolution and the feedback between massive star formation and subsequent star formation in molecular clouds .",
    "observations of pdrs compared with theoretical models probe the physical conditions in star - forming regions through dust and gas emission mainly in the infrared ( ir ) wavelength region of the spectrum .",
    "pdrs are the source of most of the ir emission in the galaxy .",
    "dust grains and large carbonaceous molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) absorb radiation from the stars , and re - radiate this energy flux in the infrared , producing a continuum with solid state and pah spectral signatures .",
    "fuv photons incident on dust grains and pahs also cause photoelectric ejection of electrons which then collisionally heat the gas , a process called the grain photoelectric heating mechanism ( e.g. , watson 1972 , bakes & tielens 1994 , weingartner & draine 2001 ) .",
    "the gas cools via emission in many ir lines .",
    "emission from pdrs has been quite successfully modelled ( see hollenbach & tielens 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "the models are usually parameterized by @xmath13 , the ratio of the fuv flux to the habing ( 1968 ) fuv band flux of @xmath14 erg @xmath3s@xmath15 characteristic of the local interstellar radiation field , and @xmath16 , the density of the gas . for advecting ( non - stationary ) models ,",
    "the flow velocity of the material through the pdr is also a parameter .",
    "the fuv fields in pdrs near ob star - forming regions such as the orion bar or m17 sw are typically very high , ( @xmath13 @xmath17 @xmath18 ) ; the pdr gas in these regions is inferred to be very dense with average densities @xmath19 @xmath20 ( tielens & hollenbach 1985b ) . on larger scales and in more evolved regions such as the rosette nebula , the fuv fields and the average densities may be significantly lower by factors of @xmath21 .",
    "infrared , sub - millimeter and millimeter wavelength observations of pdrs indicate that gas in pdrs is inhomogeneous ( van der werf et al .",
    "1993 , luhman et al .",
    "1998 ) , which is not surprising since molecular clouds themselves are observed to be highly inhomogeneous on a wide range of scales from tens of parsecs down to tenths of a parsec ( e.g. , genzel 1991 ) .",
    "there is both indirect and direct evidence for clumpiness in pdrs .",
    "spatially extended fine structure line emission of neutral and singly - ionized carbon near regions shows that the fuv penetrates deeper into the cloud than predicted by homogeneous models , suggesting that the gas is clumpy in nature ( meixner et al .",

    "1988 , steiman - cameron et al .",
    "further , strengths of high excitation lines of molecular species like co j=14@xmath2213 are observed to be greater than that predicted to arise from gas with density inferred from other pdr species .",
    "it is thus inferred that in regions such as m17 sw and the orion bar , the pdr gas consists of a `` low '' density ( typically @xmath23@xmath20 ) component responsible for the extended ci and cii emission and high - density clumps ( n @xmath24 @xmath20 ) which give rise to the high excitation co lines from their surfaces or , more precisely , at a depth of @xmath251 from their surfaces ( burton et al .",

    "the small regions of enhanced emission are interpreted as indicating the presence of high density clumps ( @xmath28 @xmath20 ) with sizes @xmath29 0.02 pc , occupying a very small volume filling factor @xmath30 . however , this interpretation is not very conclusive , and in this paper we present evidence to show that small clumps with such high densities may not exist in pdrs .",
    "small differences in temperature within the observed regions can also explain the observed emission , as h@xmath27 emission is highly sensitive to gas temperature ( marconi et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "dense pdrs like the orion bar are spatially thin structures and if these pdrs are indeed clumpy , the clumps must have sizes smaller than the thickness of the warm pdr , @xmath31 pc for the orion bar .",
    "the presence of small clumps affects the infrared spectrum from pdrs by introducing a range of densities in the fuv - illuminated region and by introducing enhanced advection in clumps that are photoevaporating .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to investigate the conditions under which small , high - density clumps exist in pdrs .",
    "small clumps might not exist in significant numbers if the intense fuv field photoevaporates them quickly .",
    "the incident fuv field heats up and pressurizes the surface layers of the clumps , causing the layers to expand .",
    "this mass loss may cause a complete photoevaporation of the dense clumps , and thus destroy them on short timescales .",
    "the mass loss timescales due to photoevaporation of an fuv - exposed clump can be estimated by assuming that the heated gas at the surface flows outwards at its sound speed , @xmath32 .",
    "the mass density at the base of this heated flow , @xmath33 , is lower than the mass density , @xmath34 , in the cold clump , as we will discuss below .",

    "this is approximately @xmath38 years .",
    "asymmetric mass loss from the surfaces of very small clumps can rocket them ( e.g. , oort & spitzer 1955 ) out of the pdr back into the cloud .",
    "clumps that survive the rocket effect and remain in the pdr are likely to lose significant fractions of their mass on short timescales of order @xmath39 years , depending on the ratio @xmath40 .",

    "large clumps survive and they can penetrate the region and affect its evolution and structure , becoming evaporating gaseous globules or `` eggs '' ( bertoldi & mckee 1990 ) .    in the present paper , we focus on the heating of an individual clump in a pdr by fuv photons from a nearby o or b star .",
    "we study a range of fuv fluxes incident on a range of clump sizes and determine the photoevaporative lifetimes of the clumps and the evolution of their structure .",

    "ultimately , we are interested in the role of fuv radiation in regulating star - formation in gmcs .",
    "destruction through photodissociation and photoevaporation of potentially star - forming clumps / cores in gmcs reduces the star - forming efficiency of gmcs , and the fuv field may thereby play an important role in regulating or limiting star formation .",
    "photoevaporation of the outer envelope of a collapsing isothermal sphere by fuv radiation could rapidly deplete the material in the envelope , and may limit the final mass of the star formed . on the other hand , compression of non - collapsing clumps by shock waves driven by the warm surface gas could possibly drive the inner cores to instability and gravitational collapse , triggering star formation .    in  2 of this paper ,",
    "we discuss the present understanding of gmc structure and existing models . in  3 , we describe the evolution of an region and its surrounding pdr as they propagate into the gmc .",

    "giant molecular clouds are observed to have a hierarchical substructure that is highly inhomogeneous , with density enhancements such as cores , clumps and filaments on all observable scales , from @xmath41 pc down to @xmath42 pc .",
    "we use the term `` massive cores '' to denote large scale density enhancements ( @xmath43 pc in size ) and `` clumps '' to denote smaller scale structures ( @xmath17 few tenths of pc or less in size ) .",
    "gmcs and their more massive constituent cores are strongly self - gravitating , and are supported against collapse by turbulence and magnetic fields .",
    "the internal velocity dispersions of the substructures in molecular clouds are found to scale with their sizes , with decreasing non - thermal support on the smallest scales ( goodman et al .",
    "the column density through a gmc or a typical gmc substructure is found to be approximately a constant @xmath44 @xmath3 , although significant variations ( @xmath45 @xmath3 ) about this typical column may occur .",
    "( for a recent review on gmcs , see mckee 1999 ) .",
    "the smaller substructures or clumps are not all gravitationally bound and the exact physical nature of these clumps remains uncertain ( williams et al .",
    "they have been interpreted as temporary fluctuations in density caused by supersonic turbulence within the cloud ( e.g. , falgarone & phillips 1990 , scalo 1990 ) .",
    "this view is supported by their apparent fractal nature , which seems to show the same structure on smaller scales down to a few tenths of a parsec ( elmegreen 1999 ) , and their observed supersonic linewidths ( blitz & stark 1986 ) . in this picture ,",
    "the gravitationally unbound clumps are transient objects formed by converging supersonic turbulent flows .",
    "the non - gravitating clumps are therefore being constantly formed and destroyed , and have short lifetimes of the order of their sound crossing time , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the clump sound speed , and @xmath48 is the initial clump radius .",
    "the effect of the sudden turn - on of an fuv field on such clumps is to drive a shock into the clump , producing a smaller , denser clump with a warm evaporative outflow .",
    "surprisingly , the evaporative timescale is now somewhat longer than @xmath49 , as we will show . assuming that the fuv flux does not strongly affect the turbulence so that the formation timescale remains the same , the presence of an fuv field will not greatly change the non - gravitationally bound clump abundance , but it will compress them and alter their thermal structure and dynamical evolution .",
    "another interpretation is that small bound clumps as well as small unbound clumps represent stable physical entities confined by interclump pressure .",
    "observations through molecular line spatial maps and velocity channel maps or position - velocity diagrams indicate the presence of dense coherent structures .",
    "indirect evidence suggests the presence of a low density ( @xmath50 orders of magnitude less than the clumps ) `` interclump medium '' ( icm ) ( see williams et al . 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "the icm exhibits high velocity motions ( @xmath51 km s@xmath15 ) and therefore may have significant pressure , which could be of thermal , magnetic or turbulent origin .",
    "clumps in this picture are confined by the icm , and some of them may be self - gravitating ( maloney 1988 , bertoldi & mckee 1992 ) .",
    "pressure - confined clumps live much longer and presumably form more slowly than the gravitationally unbound clumps of the turbulent model . therefore",
    ", fuv heating of these clumps and their destruction through photoevaporation will have a much more pronounced effect on lowering the clump abundance in this interpretation .",
    "massive stars form in the central regions of clumpy , massive , cores ( @xmath52 ) , of radius @xmath53 pc inside gmcs ( see review by evans 1999 ) .",
    "these massive cores contain clumps whose densities may reach @xmath54 @xmath20 , or even higher ( plume et al 1997 ) , and the clumps are surrounded by interclump gas with lower , but uncertain densities , possibly @xmath55 @xmath20 .",
    "when a massive star forms , the euv photons from the star immediately ionize the nearby interclump gas , and form an region .",
    "the clumps in the region are also exposed to the ionizing radiation and evaporate ( bertoldi 1989 , bertoldi and mckee 1990 ) .",
    "the fuv photons penetrate further through the interclump gas beyond the interclump ionization front ( if ) and dissociate the molecular gas , forming a dissociation front ( df ) and a pdr .    in the earliest stages of evolution when euv photons emerge from the forming o / b star , the if moves as an r - type front",
    ". however , the if quickly stalls and becomes d - type , at which point the high pressure region drives a @xmath56 10 km s@xmath15 shock into the neutral interclump gas beyond the if .",
    "it is instructive to obtain a sense of sizescale at the r / d type transition .",
    "assuming the massive star emits @xmath57 lyman continuum photons per second , the strmgren radius at this juncture is @xmath58pc , where @xmath59s@xmath15 and the electron number density @xmath60 @xmath20 . if the central star has an fuv luminosity of @xmath61 ( typical of stars with @xmath62 ) , the fuv flux incident on the surrounding pdr is characterized by @xmath63 .",
    "the thickness of the pdr is approximately @xmath64@xmath65 or @xmath66 pc .",
    "the df initially advances ahead of the shock , but as photodissociation approaches equilibrium with h@xmath27 formation , the df slows down . eventually , the shock moves ahead of the df , and the entire pdr is contained in the post - shock shell .",
    "the shock now impacts cold molecular interclump gas .",
    "hill & hollenbach ( 1978 ) showed that at this stage the shock velocity has slowed to @xmath67 km s@xmath15 , and that , if @xmath68 @xmath20 , the shock completely stalls in @xmath69 years .",
    "therefore , there is an initial stage ( @xmath70 years , for dense icm ) in the evolution of the clumpy pdrs surrounding regions where the clumps are both shocked and exposed to the photoevaporating effects of the fuv radiation .",
    "this can be followed by a stage where the shock has stalled and unshocked clumps move into the fuv - illuminated zone .",
    "two configurations are possible after the shock stalls . if the region is still completely embedded , it becomes stationary with its pressure matched by the molecular cloud pressure and the ionizing photons completely absorbed by recombining electron / proton pairs in the region .",
    "much more likely is the situation where the region breaks through the surface of the cloud and becomes a `` blister '' region . in this case , the ionized gas can expand away from the cloud , and into the interstellar medium .",
    "the if then slowly eats its way into the pdr and the df similarly advances into the molecular cloud .",
    "the velocity of the if advancing into the pdr is of order @xmath71 km s@xmath15 , just enough so that the flux of particles through the if can balance the heavily attenuated flux of euv photons reaching the if ( see whitworth 1979 , bertoldi & draine 1996 , strzer & hollenbach 1998 ) . in such a case , the clumps entering the pdr may not have been previously shocked and compressed .",
    "further , in the turbulent gmc model , clumps form and dissipate continually and those formed in the pdr after the passage of the shock are not affected by it . in both the pdr around the trapezium stars in orion and in the m17 sw pdr ( meixner et al .",
    "1992 ) , there is no evidence for velocity shifts between pdr gas and the ambient cloud gas , or , in other words , no evidence for a shock at the present time . in this paper",
    ", we focus only on the photoevaporation of clumps , whether or not they have been shocked , and do not follow the potential shredding or flattening of a clump by the passage of a shock wave ( see , e.g. klein et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the thickness or column depth of a pdr has been defined by tielens & hollenbach ( 1985 ) to include all the gas and dust where fuv photons play a significant role in the gas heating or chemistry . by this definition , in regions like orion or m17 , the pdr extends to columns of @xmath72 @xmath3 and includes gas which is cool and molecular ( h@xmath27 , co ) , but where fuv still photodissociates o@xmath27 and h@xmath27o .",
    "we are interested in the surface column n@xmath73 of the pdr which is heated to the highest temperatures ( t@xmath74k , depending on @xmath13 and @xmath16 ) . for g@xmath75 @xmath76 , n@xmath77 @xmath3 ( equivalent to a dust fuv optical depth of order unity ) and is nearly equal to the column where atomic hydrogen converts to h@xmath27 in stationary pdrs ( tielens & hollenbach 1985 ) .",
    "we shall call this region the `` warm pdr '' hereafter to distinguish it from the entire pdr .",

    "gas and dust ( and clumps ) from the opaque molecular cloud interior are therefore advected on these timescales from the shielded cloud , through the warm pdr , and across the if into the region .",
    "figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of fuv radiation from nearby o / b stars impinging on massive cores ( large sizescales , e.g. , rosette ) and clumps ( small scales , e.g. , orion ) .",
    "fuv - illuminated clumps are heated at their surfaces on timescales @xmath6 that could be either fast or slow compared to the internal sound crossing timescale within the clump , @xmath82 .",
    "impulsive heating implies that the fuv heating of the clump surface layer , characterized by column @xmath83 , occurs with @xmath84 . in this case",
    ", the outer region is heated more quickly than the entire clump can respond , and attains a much higher pressure than the cold central region .",
    "a shock propagates inward and a heated photoevaporative flow expands off the surface .",
    "several situations in clumpy molecular clouds may lead to @xmath85 . for a clump with @xmath86 cm and @xmath87 km s@xmath15 ( t @xmath17 10k ) , @xmath88 years .",
    "the ob star may `` turn - on '' on a timescale @xmath89 years .",

    "similarly , if clumps are formed in turbulent gas by supersonic converging flows , the fuv turn - on timescale is roughly the time for the clump to form , which again is @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the supersonic turbulent speed .",
    "therefore , impulsive heating is likely the most appropriate approximation for the turbulent model of clumps in molecular gas .",
    "let us consider the other situation of long - lived clumps confined by the icm . here , slow heating is generally the best approximation , but in certain conditions , impulsive heating may be more appropriate",
    ". a common situation after the turn - on of the ob star may be the advancement of the ionization front and pdr front into the opaque molecular cloud , which occurs at speeds @xmath95 km s@xmath15 .",
    "in this situation @xmath6 is the time for the df and the if to move so that the clump is one fuv optical depth closer to the if , or @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the thickness of the heated pdr zone in the icm of density @xmath98 .",
    "the criterion for impulsive heating @xmath99 , is more easily met by larger clumps that have longer sound crossing timescales , as @xmath6 is the same for all clumps .",
    "this gives us a limiting size for clumps likely to be impulsively heated , @xmath100 which is of the order of the thickness of the interclump pdr region itself . clumps with radii smaller than this are slowly heated as they emerge from the opaque molecular cloud into the fuv - irradiated regions . since we only consider clumps _ within _ pdrs that have @xmath101 , pressure - confined clumps are generally slowly heated in our analysis .",
    "clumps that undergo slow heating , @xmath102 , adjust quasi - statically to the changing fuv flux .",
    "long - lived , small , pressure - confined clumps advecting into fuv - irradiated regions provide a prime example of this slow evolution .",

    "spherically asymmetric mass flows from photoevaporating clumps can cause a rocket effect on the clump , as first noted by oort & spitzer ( 1955 ) in their theory on cloud acceleration by ionizing radiation from ob stars .",
    "clumps exposed to fuv radiation in pdrs see a stronger incident flux of photons from the direction of the ob stars , though a significant flux due to backscattered radiation from dust on the opposite surface tends to reduce this asymmetry ( see  5.2 ) .",
    "the front and back hemispheres of the clump ( with respect to the ob star ) are thus heated to different temperatures ( different @xmath4 ) and the escaping material has a higher flow velocity on the star - facing surface of the clump .",
    "the net thrust on the clump accelerates it away from the star , and is known as the rocket effect . with the help of our analytical expressions for the evolution of an impulsively - heated , photoevaporating clump in a pdr , we now evaluate a simple criterion which determines the clump size at which the rocket effect becomes significant .    a simple 1-dimensional formulation for the acceleration due to the rocket effect is given by @xmath294 where @xmath295 and @xmath296 are the flow velocities at the front and back surfaces respectively and are assumed equal to the pdr sound speed @xmath32 at those surfaces .",

    "as the initial expansion / compression phases in the evolution of a photoevaporating clump are typically short ( see  5 ) , we ignore this initial phase of evolution and assume the clump is evolving such that its column density is at its critical value @xmath305 , for the standard values of @xmath306 and @xmath118 ( see eq .",

    "clumps much smaller than this will get rocketed back into the molecular cloud as soon as they enter the pdr , partially evaporating in the process .",
    "we emphasize again that the rocket effect is significant only for turbulent clumps which undergo impulsive heating and photoevaporative flows .",
    "pressure - confined clumps are gradually heated on their exteriors and do not go through phases of evolution with rapid mass outflows , and hence experience an insignificant rocket effect .",
    "the mass lost by a clump before it gets accelerated out of the pdr can be estimated by integrating equation  ( [ momgain ] ) with time , where only the components of velocity and mass flow along the direction towards the source are to be considered .",
    "thus the mass of the clump is approximately given by @xmath319 where @xmath320 is the difference in the flow velocities on the two sides of the clump .",
    "for typical values of @xmath321 km s@xmath15 , and @xmath322 km s@xmath15 , in the time it takes for @xmath297 to reach @xmath311 , the clump loses about @xmath323% of its initial mass .",
    "therefore clumps which are rocketed back into the cold molecular cloud interior also lose significant fractions of their mass before they attain high enough velocities to keep up with the advancing ionization front .",
    "we begin our discussion by summarizing our results for both the case where clumps are produced by turbulence in regions with insignificant interclump pressure and the case where clumps are initially stable structures confined by interclump pressure .",
    "consider first the scenario where clumps are continually generated by turbulence in the molecular clouds and the pdr .",
    "initially , the evolution of the clump is determined by its column and the strength of the fuv flux .",
    "if @xmath324 , or @xmath325 for @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath326 , there is a very brief period of shock compression but the shock quickly dissipates before making it to the clump centre and the clump radius shrinks only slightly .",
    "subsequently , the clump expands until @xmath327 , at which point the photoevaporative flow halts the expansion and proceeds to shrink and compress the clump gas , maintaining @xmath153 , or a column @xmath328 . if @xmath329 , then the shock propagates to the centre of the clump , compressing it significantly , followed by an evolution at @xmath330 identical to that above .    during the final @xmath153 evolution of the shrinking , compressing ,",
    "evaporating clump , the rocket effect may play a significant role depending on the physical size of the clump at this time .",
    "if @xmath331 , the clumps will be accelerated into the molecular cloud , losing a significant fraction of their mass in the process . if @xmath332 , the clumps will tend to evaporate in the pdr region . however , because in the turbulent model clumps are forming in the pdr , including the region near the if , some of these clumps will survive to enter an advancing region . if @xmath333 and an region is advancing , then most of these large clumps will survive to be engulfed by the region .",
    "the lifetimes of turbulent clumps are of order several sound crossing times of the initial size of the clump ( eq.[[tpe2simtext ] ] and eq.[[az ] ] ) . as discussed previously ,",
    "this is somewhat longer than clump lifetimes in the absence of an fuv field .",
    "since turbulent clumps are being continuously formed , the steady - state abundance of clumps could actually increase in the presence of an fuv field .",
    "based on these results , the following predictions can be made for the turbulent scenario of photoevaporating clumps in pdrs .    1",
    ".   there will be an enhanced population of clumps with columns @xmath334 .",
    "note that this implies that in comparing this population from one pdr to another , the pdr with the lower @xmath4 ( e.g. , due to lower @xmath13 ) will have clumps with smaller column densities .",
    "2 .   there will be a population of small clumps ( @xmath335 ) moving with velocity @xmath336 into the molecular cloud at @xmath337 .",
    "3 .   compared with clumps in fuv - shielded regions , the clumps in turbulent pdrs will be smaller , denser and potentially more numerous .",
    "4 .   similarly , the clumps entering the regions will be smaller and denser than the molecular cloud clumps , and will have columns peaked at @xmath338 .",
    "we note here that in the present analysis , turbulent clumps are geometrically idealized as constant density spheres . in reality , turbulently generated structures may also be sheet - like or filamentary in nature .",
    "let us consider two simple representations of these geometries , disks and cylinders .",
    "for these structures to survive immediate photodissociation , the column density through their shortest dimension has to be greater than @xmath83 .",
    "disks with larger column densities through their midplane establish photoevaporative flows in an fuv radiation field . when the outer boundary of the heated gas reaches a distance equal to the radius of the disk , the flow diverges and the density in the flow ( refer eq.[[c ] ] and eq.[[aa ] ] ) begins to drop as @xmath339 if @xmath340 . therefore , the mass loss rate from the disk is essentially similar to that of a spherical clump of size equal to the disk radius ( johnstone et al .",
    "1998 ) photoevaporative flows from a cylindrical structure differ slightly from those off a spherical clump of the same radius .",
    "the density at the base of the flow is now @xmath341 and therefore , the critical column density @xmath342 . the mass loss rate from the cylindrical clump ( following shock compression or initial expansion ) no longer depends on the radius and is a constant given by @xmath343 where @xmath344 is the length of the cylindrical filament .",
    "eq.[[ao ] ] ) . in summary , for turbulent clumps which are likely to be sheets or filaments , the mass loss from a thin sheet or disk of dimension @xmath345 is best modelled as a clump of radius @xmath345 . the mass loss rate from a disk of radius @xmath345 and thickness @xmath346 is similar to that of a sphere of radius @xmath345 and is @xmath347 , but the evaporation timescale is @xmath348 and hence much smaller than the sphere ( @xmath349 ) for @xmath350 .",
    "filaments of radius @xmath345 evolve somewhat differently than spheres of radius @xmath345 ; their mass loss rates do not decline as @xmath345 shrinks .",
    "however , the evaporation timescales evolve similarly for cylinders or spheres since for spheres @xmath351 , whereas for cylinders @xmath352 .",
    "consider next the scenario where clumps are pressure - confined structures which are bounded by a low - density icm , and the fuv turn - on timescale is of order the crossing time @xmath353 for clumps through the pdr .",
    "for small clumps with @xmath354 , the fuv turn - on time @xmath228 , which means that the fuv quasi - statically heats and expands an outer pdr surface on the clump , continually maintaining a pressure @xmath355 in the pdr region and in the cold clump region .",
    "again , the evolution of the clump is determined by its column and the strength of the fuv flux . if @xmath356 ( for @xmath357 , and @xmath358 ) , the clump is completely heated and photodissociated as it enters the pdr from the molecular cloud .",
    "if @xmath359 , the clump shrinks to a smaller cold clump surrounded by a pdr shell . since the evolution is quasi - static , there is insignificant rocket effect on these clumps . in this scenario , small cold clumps , protected by pdr shells ,",
    "can survive passage through the pdr and into the region .",
    "however , the minimum initial column for such a clump is @xmath360 ( for @xmath121 , and @xmath358 ) .    for large clumps , @xmath361 , @xmath362 , which means that shocks compress the clump and strong photoevaporative outflows",
    "are initiated as the clump enters the pdr .",
    "clumps with @xmath363/3 , are compressed by shocks which propagate to the centre , but they finally relax to an analogous situation as above , i.e. , a thick pdr shell surrounding a small mass cold clump if @xmath359 and totally photodissociated otherwise .",
    "clumps with @xmath364 have a brief period of shock compression and pdr expansion , but rapidly relax to a configuration with a thin pdr shell and most of the initial mass still in the cold shielded core .",
    "all the large clumps experience a rocket effect .",
    "however , as shown earlier , large clumps with @xmath315 do not experience enough rocket acceleration to prevent them from entering the region .",
    "therefore , in the icm confined scenario , a variety of clump sizes enter the region .",
    "however , the small clumps entering the region were initially clumps of larger size and mass in the molecular cloud , and they enter the region with large protective pdr shells .    one can compare the abundance of clumps of various sizes in pdrs with the abundance of clumps in the molecular cloud , under the assumption that icm - confined clumps are long - lived ( the formation time of clumps exceeds the crossing time @xmath353 ) .",
    "small cold clumps are converted to pdrs but larger cold clumps are converted to small cold clumps with pdr shells and this partially replaces the small clump population .",
    "thus , there will be a significant drop in the cold clump population with @xmath365 .",
    "however , the population @xmath366 is little affected .",
    "therefore , a variety of clump sizes enter the region , but there is a suppression of clumps with columns @xmath365 compared to the distribution in the shielded molecular cloud .    based on these results ,",
    "the following predictions can be made for clumps initially confined by interclump pressure .    1 .",
    "compared with small cold clumps ( @xmath365 ) in similar pressure regions of the molecular cloud , clumps of the same column density in pdrs will have a smaller relative population .",
    "correspondingly , small and large clumps enter the advancing regions , but the relative number of small clumps is suppressed .",
    "larger clumps are relatively unaffected , but do experience an initial transient period of shock compression and photoevaporative flow .",
    "3 .   small clumps ( @xmath365 ) in the fuv - illuminated region will have small masses relative to their pdr shells .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    we have shown that small clumps tend to be destroyed before they are overtaken by the ionization front of the advancing region .",
    "this would affect the number , size distribution , and structure of pressure - confined clumps that enter an region , and therefore affect the evolution of the region ( see bertoldi 1989 and bertoldi & mckee 1990 for a discussion of the effect of photoevaporating clumps on the evolution of an region ) .",
    "clumps that survive to enter the region will thus have undergone significant evolution from their initial states .",
    "these clumps could be considerably denser if they are still vigorously photoevaporating as they enter the region , where they continue to photoevaporate ( bertoldi 1989 , bertoldi & mckee 1990 ) .",
    "we will discuss the propagation of clumps into regions in a separate paper , with application to the eagle nebula .",
    "we conclude our discussion by using our results to critique the previous inferences of dense ( @xmath367 @xmath20 ) fuv heated clumps in pdrs and to propose several observational consequences of our results .",
    "our photoevaporation models provide arguments against the interpretation that dense ( @xmath368 @xmath20 ) pdr surfaces of clumps give rise to the observed high excitation co lines .",
    "the fundamental problem is the propagation of the fuv photons to regions of such high density .",
    "if densities of @xmath369 @xmath20 are in fact heated to @xmath370k , then the thermal pressures in these regions are much larger than the pressures in the interclump gas .",
    "the only way this is possible is if : ( i ) the clumps are gravitationally bound or ( ii ) the warm surface regions are photoevaporating , as discussed in this paper . in either case",
    ", the density in the clump will smoothly fall off with radius , @xmath371 where @xmath372 , until the transition to the icm . however , fuv photons which heat the co are only able to penetrate through a column @xmath373 @xmath3 , where @xmath374 this equation reveals the size @xmath345 of the fuv heated region if a density @xmath375 is required in this region .",
    "it implies that for the fuv to heat gas at densities @xmath376 @xmath20 , the clumps must be very small with size scales of @xmath377 @xmath378 cm at this density .",
    "gravitationally bound clumps have densities @xmath368 @xmath20 at sizes @xmath379 cm ( e.g. , shu 1977 ) . in such clumps , the fuv would not penetrate to such high densities , but would be absorbed in the lower density regions further out .",
    "such small scales as @xmath380 cm also argue against unbound clumps explaining the high temperature co emission .",
    "we have shown in this paper that such a small clump will either be rocketed out of the pdr or photoevaporate in roughly a sound crossing time , or @xmath381 years , a time so short as to rule out this possibility .    the size scale of 100 au is suggestive of disks around young stars rather than clumps , so that one might appeal to photoevaporating disks like the `` proplyds '' in orion ( e.g. , johnstone et al . 1998 ) . here",
    ", the enormous mass reservoir of the disk greatly lengthens the photoevaporative timescale .",
    "however , the area filling factor of these photoevaporating disks required to match the co high - j line intensities in , for example , the orion bar region is of order @xmath42 ( burton et al .",
    "such a high area filling factor requires a volume density of @xmath382 stars pc@xmath383 , more than an order of magnitude higher than that observed in the densest region of the stellar cluster near the trapezium ( mccaughrean et al . 1994 ) .",
    "photoevaporating proplyds are thereby also ruled out .",
    "therefore , it seems quite unlikely that fuv radiation is heating dense , @xmath368 @xmath20 , pdr surfaces of clumps or that photoevaporating proplyds can explain the mid - j co emission .",
    "we suspect that the co emission arises in @xmath384 @xmath20 surfaces of large ( @xmath385 cm ) clumps , and that the chemistry , heating and/or dynamics needs to be modified in pdr models in order to better match the observations .",
    "there are several observational consequences implicit in the scenario of a strongly photoevaporating ( i.e. , @xmath123 ) clump .",
    "first , the molecular material from the clump core is effectively advected out into the pdr region , as has been discussed by bertoldi & draine ( 1996 ) , strzer & hollenbach ( 1998 ) , hollenbach & tielens ( 1999 ) .",
    "this can have strong effects on the chemistry , primarily because h@xmath27 can exist in surface regions where it would have been atomic in a stationary , steady - state case . in turn",
    ", the higher abundance of h@xmath27 can chemically enhance the abundance of other minor species , such as h@xmath386 ( bertoldi & draine 1996 ) and co and can modify the heating and cooling processes and therefore the pdr temperature",
    ". initial results ( strzer & hollenbach 1998 and strzer 2000 , private communication ) suggest that advection will enhance the intensities of the mid - j co lines , by creating more warm co near the surface . finally , the flow will broaden line widths to values @xmath387 .",
    "however , it should be noted that many common molecules , such as co , hco@xmath388 , cs , hcn , cn still exist primarily at column depths @xmath389 from the surface , where the advection velocities are low .",
    "broader linewidths should be seen in ( 158@xmath390),(63@xmath390 ) and possibly the h@xmath27 ( 2@xmath390 ) lines .",

    "however , there does appear to be a weak trend of increasing @xmath391 with @xmath4 , which if real is not easily explained in this model .",
    "the clumps in ngc 2023 are probably pressure - confined , and seem to have lost almost 75% of their original mass through fuv heating .",
    "high resolution observations of clumps in pdrs , with more accurate determinations of the sizes and densities of clumps would help in locating them more precisely on the @xmath154 plots , and thus be able to distinguish between the pressure - confined and turbulent clump models .",
    "we have studied the effects of fuv radiation from young ob stars on the evolution of dense structures or clumps in photodissociation regions .",
    "we find that the ambient fuv field penetrates through the surface of a dense clump and heats this surface layer to high temperatures , causing mass loss and thereby inducing photoevaporation of the clump . through analytic approximations and numerical hydrodynamical calculations , we determined the evolution and lifetimes of clumps , subject to various physical conditions and initial parameters .",
    "the evolution of a clump is mainly determined by three parameters , the ratio of the initial column density to the column penetrated by the fuv flux , @xmath1 ; the strength of the fuv field , which we denote by the ratio of the sound speeds in the heated gas and the cold clump material , @xmath4 ; and the timescale for the turn - on of the fuv field , relative to the sound crossing time through the clump , @xmath424 .",
    "we consider the evolution of turbulent , impulsively - heated clumps and also pressure - confined clumps in a pdr .",
    "impulsively heated clumps with a photoevaporation parameter @xmath425 are initially compressed by a shock driven by the external high - pressure fuv - heated layer to high densities , and later lose mass as the fuv gradually penetrates through the entire clump .",
    "clumps with @xmath324 go through an initial expansion phase after the rapid decay of the shock wave .",
    "both clumps with @xmath329 and @xmath324 evolve toward the @xmath426 condition .",
    "the final evolution toward complete photodissociation and heating occurs at constant column through the clump , the density increasing as the clump shrinks .",
    "photoevaporation timescales in all these cases are typically a few @xmath49 , suggesting clump destruction times of @xmath427 years , under typical pdr conditions .",
    "slowly heated clumps evolve quasi - statically , and if confined by an external icm pressure , a fraction of the initial cold clump mass may be retained if @xmath428 .",
    "clumps with initial column densities @xmath429 are completely photoevaporated by the fuv flux .",
    "we predict that in the turbulent scenario , observed clumps should all have columns close to the critical value for the local fuv field , @xmath430 .",
    "clumps lifetimes are prolonged by photoevaporation and we also expect a higher steady - state abundance of clumps in pdrs as compared to the shielded molecular cloud interior . for pressure - confined clumps , there will be a decrease in the number of smaller clumps in pdrs , and many clumps will lose substantial fractions of their mass to extended warm pdr shells around them .",
    "we compared our results to observations of some well - studied pdrs , such as the orion bar , m17sw , ngc 2023 and the rosette pdr , and find that the data are consistent with both clump models , but perhaps favour the turbulent clump interpretation .",
    "clumps entering the region around an o / b star with a d - type ionization front are expected to have thus undergone significant evolution as they pass through the pdr .",
    "we acknowledge support from the nasa astrophysical theory program under rtop 344 - 04 - 10 - 02 , which supports the center for star formation studies .",

    "we thank k.  r.  bell , m.  kaufman , c.  mckee and h.  strzer for useful discussions .",
    "we first define several characteristic timescales during evolution .",
    "the initial sound crossing time through the clump is denoted by @xmath432 .",
    "we can similarly define a sound crossing time through the warm pdr layer , as @xmath433 .",
    "finally , we define the timescale for the pdr layer to expand to a thickness comparable to @xmath132 , @xmath434 .",
    "we relate the density @xmath435 at the base of the pdr shell ( @xmath436 ) to @xmath83 for epochs when the pdr shell has expanded to a thickness greater than the clump radius ( @xmath437 ) .",
    "the fuv - heated shell of initial thickness @xmath438 expands as an isothermal flow into vacuum and the characteristics of the flow regions are essentially similar to that of the parker wind solution with no gravity ( parker 1958 ) . for simplicity",
    ", it is assumed here that once the warm pdr region has expanded to @xmath439 or @xmath440 , the gas leaves the clump surface at @xmath32 and the velocity of the heated gas increases linearly with radius .",
    "based on our hydrodynamical code results , this is a reasonable approximation to within about two clump radii , where most of the column density in the pdr gas lies .",
    "the clump mass loss rate is determined by the penetration depth of the fuv flux , and hence @xmath83 . for a power law density profile in the shell ( @xmath441 ) ,",
    "most of this column arises from the base of the shell , or , more precisely , from the region between the base ( clump surface ) @xmath442 and @xmath443 . from the equation of continuity and @xmath444 , the steady flow density profile of the warm pdr shell",
    "is obtained as , @xmath445 valid for @xmath446 once the shell has expanded to at least two clump radii ( @xmath437 ) .",
    "equation  ( [ c ] ) can be easily integrated over @xmath345 to obtain the column through the warm pdr at any given instant of time .",
    "let @xmath442 denote the instantaneous cold clump radius and @xmath447 the total radius of cold clump and warm pdr gas . at @xmath188 , @xmath448 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath449 for @xmath437 , and as the fuv flux always penetrates through a column @xmath83 , we have @xmath450    we next write down the equations of momentum flux or pressure .",
    "the pressure in the shocked cold clump gas is the sum of thermal , turbulent and magnetic pressures and given by @xmath451 where @xmath452 is the shocked clump density at time @xmath346 , @xmath133 is the initial clump density , @xmath453 is the initial ratio of turbulent and thermal pressures , and @xmath117 is the initial ratio of magnetic to thermal pressure in the clump .",
    "the pressure at the base of the pdr flow , @xmath454 , is given by @xmath455 where @xmath456 is the outward flow at the base .",
    "we assume that @xmath457 , and from equations  ( [ aa ] ) and  ( [ ac ] ) , @xmath458    the boundary between the `` shock compression '' and `` initial expansion '' regions of figure 2 is determined by comparing equations  ( [ ab ] ) and  ( [ ad ] ) .",
    "values of the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath4 on this boundary are such that the shock dies out just before making it to the centre .",
    "the pressure in the clump at this instant is about the same as the initial pressure and @xmath459 . in a time @xmath460 ,",
    "the outer edge of the pdr shell expands out to @xmath461 , and the initial pdr column begins to decrease appreciably due to spherical divergence , allowing further fuv flux penetration .    if @xmath462 , the pressure in the pdr flow is sufficiently high for the shock wave to reach the centre of the clump , compressing the clump and raising its central pressure so that @xmath463 .",
    "such clumps lie in the `` shock compression '' of figure 2 .",
    "if the initial parameters are such that @xmath464 , the shock wave rapidly dies out before reaching the centre and the clump then stops contracting and begins to expand at a speed @xmath465 , maintaining pressure equilibrium .",
    "these two evolutionary sequences are separated by the ( @xmath466 ) boundary obtained setting @xmath467 , or from equations  ( [ ab ] ) and  ( [ ad ] ) , @xmath468 for values of @xmath1 and @xmath4 typical in pdrs such as orion ( @xmath469 ) this relation can be approximated as @xmath470 .",
    "a photoevaporation parameter @xmath471 can be defined such that the relation @xmath153 demarcates the two regions .",
    "clumps with @xmath329 are shock compressed and those with @xmath324 initially expand .",
    "as the flow expands in a shock compressed clump , the clump shrinks by losing mass at a rate @xmath472 initially , a shock is driven into the clump , but we do not attempt to analytically model the propagation of the shock wave in detail .",
    "we assume that the shock travels inward at the pdr sound speed and the entire clump gets compressed in a time @xmath473 , where @xmath474 .",
    "we first solve for the clump radius , mass and mass loss rate for @xmath475 , during the epoch when the shock propagates to the centre .",

    "the density is low and here the thermal pressure and dynamical pressure dominate .",

    "<S> the evolution also depends on whether a confining interclump medium exists , or whether the interclump region has negligible pressure , as is the case for turbulence - generated clumps . in this paper , we use spherical 1-d numerical hydrodynamic models as well as approximate analytical models to study the dependence of clump photoevaporation on the physical parameters of the clump , and to derive the dynamical evolution , mass loss rates and photoevaporative timescales of a clump for a variety of astrophysical situations . </S>",

    "<S> clumps with insufficient magnetic pressure support , and in strong fuv fields may be driven to collapse by the compressional effect of converging shock waves . </S>",
    "<S> we also estimate the rocket effect on photoevaporating clumps and find that it is significant only for the smallest clumps , with sizes much less than the extent of the pdr itself . </S>",
    "<S> clumps that are confined by an interclump medium may either get completely photoevaporated , or may preserve a shielded core with a warm , dissociated , protective shell that absorbs the incident fuv flux . </S>",

    "<S> the data are consistent with both interpretations of clump origin , turbulence and pressure confinement , with a slight indication for favouring the turbulent model for clumps over pressure - confined clumps . </S>"
