    "recently , the theoretical discovery of quantum dragons has been published @xcite .",
    "this paper addresses the pervasiveness of quantum dragon nanodevices .",
    "all who are taught the basics of electricity learn about electrical resistance .",
    "electrical resistance is the physical principle underlying the glow of light bulbs , the heating of the element in your conventional oven and of your stovetop , the heat produced by your laptop computers and mobile devices , and the energy losses in transmission lines .",
    "a perfect electrical conductor would have zero electrical resistance , and consequently classically an electric current would not cause any heating .    a recent discovery of a large class of nanodevices called quantum dragons @xcite has potential technological impacts in nano - electronics .",
    "a quantum dragon is a nanodevice that has zero electrical resistance , and therefore is a perfect conductor .",
    "the caveat is that in the quantum regime the electrons propagate coherently , and for coherent propagation the classical concept of ohm s law is not valid @xcite .",
    "a quantum dragon has zero electrical resistance in a four - probe measurement @xcite . in a two - probe measurement ,",
    "the electrical resistance of a quantum dragon is quantitized . in particular , for a single open quantum channel",
    "the electrical resistance in a two - probe measurement is @xmath3 , with the quantum of conductance @xmath4  s @xcite . here",
    "@xmath5 is the charge of an electron and @xmath6 is planck s constant .",
    "the seminal work of landauer @xcite showed that from the solution of time - independent schrdinger equation @xcite the transmission probability as a function of energy , @xmath0 , was critical to obtain the electrical conductance via what is now called the landauer formula .",
    "the landauer formula is for two - probe measurements .",
    "the electrical conductance is given by a convolution of the fermi function for the electrons with @xmath0 .",
    "for more complicated measurements , such as a four - probe measurement , the buttiker - landauer formula is the generalization of the landauer formula that must be used .",
    "many excellent books have been written using the buttiker - landauer formula @xcite , including coherent transport through nano - structures    a quantum dragon is a nanodevice that when connected to idealized leads ( as in the example of fig .  [ figqmanydragon1 ] ) has full transmission of electrons for all energies that can propagate through the leads @xcite .",
    "in other words , in a quantum dragon electrons for any propagating energy @xmath7 have total transmission , the transmission probability is @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "thus a quantum dragon nanodevice will behave as if the electrons underwent ballistic propagation .",
    "however , ballistic propagation requires no scattering of incident electrons , while there may be strong scattering of electrons in a quantum dragon .",
    "the best known experimental example of a quantum dragon is a single - walled carbon nanotube in the armchair configuration @xcite . for a quantum dragon @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 , and in a two - probe measurement the landauer formula thus gives the single - channel electrical conductance @xmath8 .    at the most basic level",
    ", the single - band tight - binding model for electrical transmission can be viewed as a weighted undirected graph @xcite connected to idealized semi - infinite leads .",
    "the tight - binding parameters include the on - site energy associated with a the vertex weight ( atom weight or node weight ) of the graph .",
    "vertex @xmath9 will have a weight @xmath10 .",
    "the tight - binding hopping parameters are the weights given to the edges ( bonds ) of the graph .",
    "we consider graphs composed of @xmath11@xmath12@xmath2 slices , with only electron hopping allowed within a slice or between atoms in nearest - neighbor slices .",
    "we use @xmath13 as the strength of the intra - slice hopping parameters between vertices @xmath9 and @xmath14 .",
    "similarly , we use @xmath15 as the strength of the inter - slice hopping parameters between vertices .",
    "similarly , @xmath16 or @xmath17 are the strengths of the weights of hopping between the last ( first ) vertex of the input ( output ) lead and each vertex in the first ( last ) slice .",
    "the statements and proofs in this paper are in regard to weighted undirected graphs .",
    "the discussion section will bring the weighted undirected graph study back to examination of physical nanodevices .    in this paper",
    ", we show the weighted undirected graph associated with _ any _ nanodevice can be a quantum dragon .",
    "the question to be addressed is how many parameters within the tight - binding model must be tuned in order to obtain @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "three prescriptions are presented to make the weighted graphs into a quantum dragon . in the first two prescriptions , we consider only homogeneous weighted graphs made of @xmath11 identical slices of @xmath18 atoms , with only the simplest inter - slice connections . in the third prescription",
    "the constraint of homogeneity of slices is relaxed .",
    "the three prescriptions to make a weighted undirected graph a quantum dragon by tuning certain tight - binding parameters are listed below . in all cases",
    "we only consider connected graphs for the nanodevice , although some of these prescriptions may be modified to deal with graphs that are not connected .    1 .",
    "if all @xmath19 and intra - slice hopping @xmath13 are arbitrarily fixed , and only the simplest inter - slice hopping parameters @xmath20 are included , a weighted graph composed of identical slices can be a quantum dragon by tuning @xmath21@xmath22@xmath23 parameters : * the hopping parameters between the lead and nanodevice must each be a unique value ; * a uniform electrical potential shift of all on - site energies @xmath10 ; * all inter - slice hopping parameters @xmath15 must be scaled ( tuned ) by the same value ; * the output lead connections to the last ( @xmath24 ) slice are identical to the input lead connections to the first slice .",
    "if all input lead to nanodevice hopping parameters , @xmath25 , are in arbitrarily fixed ratios and non - zero , only the simplest inter - slice hopping terms are included , and all @xmath10 and intra - slice hopping @xmath13 are fixed , requires tuning @xmath21@xmath22@xmath23 parameters : * each @xmath10 must be shifted ( tuned ) by a unique value of the electrical potential at site @xmath9 by @xmath26 ; * the strength of all lead - device hopping parameters must be normalized ( tuned ) in a unique fashion ; * all inter - slice hopping parameters @xmath15 must be scaled ( tuned ) by the same value ; * the output lead connections , @xmath27 , to the last ( @xmath24 ) slice are identical to the input lead connections , @xmath25 , to the first slice .",
    "3 .   if all @xmath10 and intra - slice hopping @xmath13 are arbitrarily fixed in each slice , but the slices of the weighted graph are not homogeneous : * the hopping parameters between the leads and the nanodevice must each be a unique ( tuned ) value , which may be different for the connections to the input lead ( @xmath16 ) and output lead ( @xmath17 ) ; * a uniform electrical potential shift ( tuning ) of all on - site energies @xmath10 in each slice , but the tuning required may be different for each slice ; * a unique ( tuned ) value for each of the inter - slice hopping terms @xmath15 , which may be different between each pair of atoms on adjacent slices .",
    "the vast majority of calculations use the green s function method to calculate the electrical conductance @xcite .",
    "the green s function implicitly solves the schrdinger equation , and through the landauer equation @xcite gives @xmath0 and the electrical conductivity . in this paper",
    ", we use a different standard technique , called the matrix method @xcite , which solves the schrdinger equation using an particular _ ansatz_. from the matrix method solution of the schrdinger equation , one can calculate @xmath0 , and hence the electrical conductivity from the landauer equation @xcite .",
    "there are several papers that use the matrix method to calculate @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "three prescriptions , all allowing for quantum dragons from inhomogeneous nanodevices , have been presented in detail .",
    "the first two prescriptions have the simplest inter - slice hopping terms , and have every slice identical .",
    "the first prescription allows arbitrary fixed values for the positions of all atoms , of all electrical potentials ( up to a constant shift ) , and of all the intra - slice hopping strengths between atoms . in the first prescription",
    "the lead - device hopping strengths must be tuned in a prescribed manner in order to obtain a quantum dragon .",
    "the second prescription is related to the first , but the lead - device connections are arbitrary values ( but identical connections for the input lead and output lead ) , while the electrical potentials on each atom must be tuned in a prescribed manner in order to obtain a quantum dragon .",
    "the third prescription has slices which may all be different , with atomic bonding strengths and electrical potentials ( up to a slice - dependent constant term ) fixed arbitrarily , while the lead - device and inter - slice hopping terms must be tuned in a prescribed manner in order to obtain a quantum dragon .    for all prescriptions",
    "the number of arbitrary parameters is much larger than the number of parameters which must be tuned in a particular fashion .",
    "for the first two prescription , the ratio of the number of tight - binding parameters is @xmath246 where @xmath18 is the number of atoms in every slice of the nanodevice . for the third prescription",
    "the number of atoms @xmath201 in each of the @xmath2@xmath195@xmath109@xmath195@xmath11 slices can be different .",
    "however , if all @xmath201@xmath1@xmath18 ( but the intra - slice bonds and electrical potential may be different for every slice ) the ratio of the number of tight - binding parameters is @xmath247 thus in all cases , quantum dragons exist only on a low - dimensional surface   of the high - dimensional tight - binding parameter space . an analogy might be useful to understand the relationship between the complete tight - binding parameter space , the parameter space of the mapping equations , and the parameter space of quantum dragons .",

    "the natural question is which , if any , prescription would yield a nanodevice and lead - slice connections that can be realized reasonably easily experimentally .",
    "the answer is that all three prescriptions have experimental difficulties .",
    "the first prescription can be used to have a single - slice ( @xmath11@xmath1@xmath2 ) nanodevice , and a quantum dragon can always be found with the correct lead - device connections . however , to make the lead - slice connections would be physically impossible at the nanoscale , particularly for a non - planar arrangement of atoms in the slice .",
    "the second prescription for completely arbitrary lead - device connections would require electric fields on the order of @xmath249  v / m precisely tuned at the nanoscale level . although not physically impossible , such high electric fields tuned to the nanoscale level would set an extremely high experimental bar .",
    "the third prescription requires inter - slice connections that seem impossible , even for the case of fig .",
    "[ figqmanydragon4 ] with only about ten atoms per slice .",
    "a more realistic method of experimentally constructing an inhomogeneous quantum dragon might take an approach that is a combination of the three prescriptions .",
    "for example , one could require that the lead - device interactions should be monotonically dependent on the distance from the lead atom , and the electric field required to change by no more than a few percent on the nanoscale level .",
    "these types of smoothness constraints are not necessary mathematically , but will be critical to synthesizing an experimental realization of inhomogeneous quantum dragons . with such smoothness constraints , a physical nanodevice may be synthesized experimentally using a combination of the first two prescriptions .    the structure of the nanodevice in fig .",
    "[ figqmanydragon1 ] in particular seems like this type of quantum dragon should be amenable to experimental synthesis .",
    "the metal polonium ( po ) has a simple cubic lattice structure , and hence fig .  [ figqmanydragon1 ] can be viewed as a nano - crystal of po .",
    "furthermore , the proofs show that any nano - crystal of po can be connected to be a quantum dragon , particularly with the end slices as ( 100 ) faces as in fig .",
    "[ figqmanydragon1 ] . of course , given the half - life of @xmath250po is about 2.9  y and that of @xmath251po is about 125  y , a perfect nano - crystal of po will only survive so long before nuclear decay creates defects .",
    "it should be possible to connect homogeneous leads to a po nano - crystal , and the search for electrical conductivity showing dragon segments may be helped by shaped electric potentials in the nanocrystal .",
    "the proofs of existence of quantum dragon segements here are only for leads of a single channel , and for homogeneous leads .",
