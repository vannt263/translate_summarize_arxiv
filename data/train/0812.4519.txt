    "the bepposax data products were extracted from the mecs and low energy concentrator spectrometers ( lecs ) using circular regions of radius 4@xmath11 and 8@xmath11 respectively .",
    "the background subtracted source spectra were analyzed with the spectral analysis package xspec v 11.2.0 .",
    "since pcu0 had lost the propane layer , we did not use the data from it in any further analysis for vela  x-1 .",
    "this was not a major issue for such a highly luminous pulsar since it did not affect the statistics .    for 4u  1538 - 52 ,",
    "the spectral model used was a simple power law along with a line - of - sight absorption , a high energy cut off and a gaussian line with center energy @xmath06.4 kev .",
    "however in case of gx  301 - 2 , the partial covering absorber model ( pcam , endo et al .",
    "2002 ) with a high energy exponential cutoff and two gaussian functions for iron k@xmath12 and k@xmath13 lines was found to fit the rxte data well compared to other models .",
    "the pcam is described as two different power law components with the same photon index but different normalizations , being absorbed by different column densities ( n@xmath14 & n@xmath15 ) respectively .",
    "the analytical form of the pcam that we have used for spectral fitting is : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the intensity , @xmath18 is the photon index , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the two equivalent hydrogen column densities , @xmath21 is the photo - electric cross - section , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the respective normalizations of the power law . for oao  1657 - 415 & vela  x-1 too , we observed that the pcam was providing the best fit for both mecs and the rxte spectra .",
    "moreover , since rxte is a non  imaging instrument and oao  1657 - 415 lies under the influence of the galactic ridge emission , we had to explicitly incorporate the ridge emission as a separate background spectral component .",
    "we put that in xspec as a sum of raymond - smith plasma and a power - law with appropriate normalizations ( valinia & marshall 1998 ) .",
    "* 4u  1538 - 52 * : the photon index , iron - line flux , cut - off energy and the e - folding energy measured with the pulse average spectrum taken over 2 - 3 ks did not show any substantial variation along the orbit which suggests that the continuum x - ray spectrum of the pulsar is hardly affected during its revolution .",
    "an important detection was a notably variation in n@xmath24 .",
    "it shows a smooth variation over orbital phase , increasing gradually by an order of magnitude as the pulsar approaches eclipse ( fig 1 : mid - eclipse is defined by phase zero ) . at orbital phases",
    "far from the eclipse , the column density has a value of @xmath0 1.5 @xmath7 10@xmath25 atoms @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , we compare the observed column density profile with a model estimated by assuming a spherically symmetric castor , abbott & klein ( cak 1975 ) wind from the companion star . the velocity profile of the line - driven wind is : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the terminal velocity for the stellar wind , r@xmath29 is the radius of the companion and @xmath30 is the radial distance from center of the companion star .",
    "the column density profiles were derived using a numerical integration along the line of sight from the pulsar to the observer . with a mass - loss rate of @xmath010@xmath4 m@xmath10 yr@xmath2 and @xmath31 @xmath01000 km s@xmath2 , the model calculations of n@xmath32 for different inclination angles when superposed on the observed values , it shows fairly reasonable agreement for three different inclination angles 65@xmath33 , 75@xmath33 and 85@xmath33 respectively ( fig .",
    "1 ) , indicating that a cak wind from the companion star may produce the observed orbital dependence of the column density for a certain range of the orbital inclination ( @xmath3465@xmath33 ) .",
    "we note here that , in fig . 1 , we have not done any fitting of the measured column densities and the model calculated column densities at different orbital phases are rather plotted together .",
    "the phase resolved column density values for the wind density model used here depend on the rate of mass loss , the terminal velocity and the inclination angle of the binary orbit .",
    "the data presented here , however , is not suitable for such a detailed analysis but only shows the consistency of the model with the observations .",
    "* gx  301 - 2 * : as in 4u  1538 - 52 , the continuum parameters do not show any orbital modulation in gx  301 - 2 . in this case , the variation of n@xmath14 & n@xmath15 with orbital phase was not smooth .",
    "the values were very high with a large variation throughout the binary orbit ( from 10@xmath25 to 10@xmath35 atoms @xmath26 ) , indicating a clumpy nature of the stellar wind ( fig .",
    "it is also seen that the covering fraction ( defined as norm2/[norm1+norm2 ] ) remains substantially high almost throughout the orbit which means that there is dense and clumpy material present throughout .",
    "this is also supported by the detection of a strong compton recoil component detected with the chandra grating spectrum and its successful reproduction by monte carlo simulations ( watanabe et al .",
    "thus it is clear that the observed variation in column density can not be explained by a spherically symmetric cak wind only , indicating the presence of strong inhomogeneities in the wind .",
    "there are two proposed models in this regard : a gas - stream model by leahy ( 1991 ) and the equatorial disk model by pravdo & ghosh ( 2001 ) . however , the orbital dependence of the absorption column densities measured by us is very different from their predictions .",
    "now , for the the iron k - line fluxes , we obtained peaks near periastron ( fig .",
    "the line equivalent width had a correlation with the column density ( n@xmath15 ) , suggesting that most of the iron line is produced by the local clumpy matter surrounding the neutron star .",
    "* oao  1657 - 415 & vela  x-1 * : the average values of the free spectral parameters measured here over the out - of - eclipse phases of the binary orbit ; viz .",
    "photon index , e - folding energy and cut - off energy , do not exhibit any modulation due to the revolution of both the pulsars .",
    "these results seem to be in conformity with that obtained for gx  301 - 2 & 4u  1538 - 52 . the column density ( n@xmath15 ) of the material that absorbs the primary x - ray emission",
    "is found to be high for both the pulsars ( fig 4 ) .",
    "a large variation of the column densities throughout the out - of - eclipse phases ( from 10@xmath25 to 10@xmath35 atoms @xmath26 ) characterizes their x - ray spectra .",
    "there were instances of moderate to high values of covering fraction . here",
    ", it should be mentioned that the number of out - of - eclipse measurements for oao  1657 - 415 are probably not sufficient to arrive at a strong conclusion .",
    "we do not attempt to compare the variations of the observed column densities with the cak model variation as we had done in case of 4u  1538 - 52 and gx  301 - 2 since it is clear from the measurements that such a comparison would definitely rule out the said model . in this context , we may point out that the spectral measurements for these two pulsars are similar in case of gx  301 - 2 ( mukherjee & paul 2004 ) . for gx  301 - 2",
    "though , formation of clumped blobs of matter could be accounted for the unusually low wind velocity and high mass loss rate , but for the present case , such an inference is probably not possible . moreover , unlike gx  301 - 2 , we do not observe any systematic orbital modulation for the iron - line fluxes .",
    "furthermore , the iron - line equivalent width also does not show any definite correlation with n@xmath15 .      1 .",
    "the pcam appears to be somewhat generic for pulsars which have variable column density , at least when observed with rxte or bepposax .",
    "2 .   for highly luminous supergiant binaries , the cak model of stellar wind does not suffice to describe the column density variations .",
    "this is corroborated by the results of gx  301 - 2 , oao  1657 - 415 & vela  x-1 in this work and of 4u  170037 ( haberl et al .",
