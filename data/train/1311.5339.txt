    "anisotropic flow  @xcite in heavy - ion collisions is understood as the hydrodynamic response  @xcite of the strongly - interacting medium to a spatial anisotropy created in the early stages of the collision .",
    "elliptic flow , @xmath2  @xcite , originates from the almond shape of the overlap area between the colliding nuclei  @xcite .",
    "similarly , triangular flow , @xmath3 , is generated by fluctuations of the initial density profile which have a triangular shape  @xcite .",
    "it has long been recognized that the extraction of transport coefficients of the strongly - coupled quark - gluon plasma ( in particular , its viscosity over entropy density ratio @xmath4  @xcite ) from elliptic flow data is hindered by the poor knowledge of the initial geometry  @xcite .",
    "specifically , different models of the initial state , supplemented with viscous hydrodynamic evolution , can be made compatible with experimental elliptic flow data at the expense of tuning @xmath4 .",
    "more recently , a large number of new flow observables have been measured , which can add extra non - trivial constraints .",
    "for example , it was noticed that , while either elliptic flow or triangular flow data could be reasonably fit individually by tuning the viscosity in a hydrodynamic calculation , only some models of the initial state could be made compatible with both .",
    "thus , some models can actually be ruled out  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to propose a systematic approach for constraining models of initial conditions using anisotropic flow data",
    ". early work in this direction was done by the alice collaboration , who was able to place constraints on the relative centrality dependence of the initial eccentricity for very central collisions at the lhc , without having to perform hydrodynamic calculations @xcite . here , by combining hydrodynamic simulations with data from au - au collisions at @xmath5  tev  @xcite and pb - pb collisions at @xmath6  tev  @xcite , we are able to place strong constraints at all centralities .",
    "we then use these constraints as a filter for existing models of initial conditions , and we provide a simple test that can be applied to any future model to quickly and easily determine whether it is compatible with these data .",
    "the observable we choose for this study is the integrated  @xcite anisotropic flow @xmath7 , i.e. , averaged over the particle transverse momentum .",
    "the reason is twofold : first , hydrodynamics is meant to describe the bulk features of particle production , therefore its most robust predictions are for bulk observables .",
    "second , differential anisotropic flow ( i.e. , its relative dependence on transverse momentum ) does not depend much on the initial state : predictions of ideal ( non - viscous ) hydrodynamics for the differential @xmath7 are to some extent universal  @xcite , while viscous corrections are determined by the late stages of the collision  @xcite",
    ". therefore one does not lose essential information on the initial state by considering only the integrated anisotropic flow .",
    "we only use two out of the six fourier harmonics which have been measured  @xcite , namely @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "again , the reason is twofold : first , they are the largest harmonics for all centralities , hence they are determined with better accuracy .",
    "second , in these two harmonics , the hydrodynamic response to the initial state is dominated by simple linear response  @xcite . specifically , elliptic flow @xmath2 in hydrodynamics is to a good approximation  @xcite proportional to the participant ellipticity @xmath0  @xcite and triangular flow is proportional  @xcite to the participant triangularity @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "@xmath8 with @xmath9 is generally defined as  @xcite @xmath10 where integration is over the transverse plane in polar coordinates , and @xmath11 denotes the energy density at @xmath12 .",
    "the system is centered , so that @xmath13 .",
    "linear response is also a reasonable approximation for @xmath14  @xcite , with a specific definition of the dipole asymmetry @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "the constraints on the initial state from @xmath14 were studied in a previous publication  @xcite .",
    "higher order fourier harmonics of anisotropic flow ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) have a more complicated relation to initial - state properties because of large nonlinear terms in the hydrodynamic response  @xcite .",
    "the linear - response approximation states @xmath19 with @xmath20 , where @xmath7 on the left - hand side is the measured flow in a given collision event .",
    "the first factor on the right - hand side is the hydrodynamic response to the initial anisotropy  @xcite , which is assumed independent of the initial profile for a given centrality , while the second factor depends only on the initial state and encodes all information about event - by - event fluctuations .",
    "experimental data for moments of the event - by - event @xmath2 and @xmath3 distribution , combined with hydrodynamical calculations of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , thus yield the values of the same moments of the initial anisotropies @xmath0 and @xmath1 . here",
    ", we use alice data inferred from two - particle correlations  @xcite and phenix data which use an event - plane method  @xcite . in practice ,",
    "both methods yield the root - mean - square ( rms ) value of the event - by - event distribution of @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "( [ linear ] ) gives : @xmath23 therefore the constraints we obtain on @xmath8 also relate to rms values .",
    "there are several sources of uncertainties in the hydrodynamic response : once these uncertainties are taken into account , the predictions span some region in the @xmath24 plane . as we show in sec .",
    "[ s : hydro ] , this region turns out to be a narrow band .",
    "this puts strong constraints on existing models of initial conditions , which are scrutinized in sec .",
    "[ s : mc ] .",
    "hydrodynamical modeling  @xcite consists of three stages .",
    "it first uses as input an initial condition for the energy - momentum tensor of the system at an early stage of the collision , which is provided by some model of the early dynamics .",
    "second , one evolves this initial condition through the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "finally , the fluid is converted into hadrons .",
    "every step of this calculation comes with its own uncertainties .",
    "investigating sources of uncertainty  @xcite in hydrodynamic modeling requires to carry out a large number of numerical calculations , and the computational effort of a state - of - the - art calculation can become prohibitively expensive  @xcite . this cost can be reduced by orders of magnitude at the expense of a few simplifying assumptions . for each of the three stages",
    ", we now describe the simplifications which can be made , and identify the leading source of uncertainty .",
    "_ 1 . initial conditions : _ our calculation uses boost - invariant initial conditions  @xcite .",
    "this amounts to neglecting the rapidity dependence of correlations due to anisotropic flow , which is known to be small at lhc energies  @xcite but may be larger at rhic  @xcite . in order to compute the hydrodynamic response in the second harmonic , @xmath21 , we parameterize the transverse density with an optical glauber model , with an impact parameter that corresponds to the rms impact parameter of each bin in a monte carlo glauber calculation .",
    "the overall normalization is then set to match the observed charged multiplicity  @xcite . in a centered polar coordinate system @xmath25",
    ", the optical glauber profile has @xmath26 symmetry for a symmetric collision , hence @xmath27 . in order to compute the response @xmath28 , we introduce by hand a triangularity by deforming the optical glauber profile as follows  @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is magnitude of the deformation , and @xmath31 its orientation .",
    "the nonlinear coupling between @xmath2 and @xmath3  @xcite induces a small modulation of @xmath3 with @xmath31 , whose relative magnitude scales like @xmath32 ( the reaction plane is chosen along the @xmath33 axis ) .",
    "we find this dependence to be 1% or less in all cases : therefore we neglect it and choose @xmath34 for all calculations .",
    "we have also checked that the dependence of the ratio @xmath22 on the values chosen for @xmath30 @xcite is negligible .",
    "this calculation uses the same values of @xmath30 as  @xcite . note that recentering the distribution after deformation shifts the center by a distance proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "this in turn results in a decrease of @xmath1 of relative order @xmath36 . this recentering correction was neglected in  @xcite and the hydrodynamic response was therefore underestimated by up to 10% for peripheral collisions .    within our linear - response approximation  ( [ linear ] ) , the hydrodynamic response @xmath37 is assumed independent of the fine structure of the initial profile . event - by - event ideal hydrodynamic calculations  @xcite have proven that a such a `` single - shot '' calculation with smooth initial condition yields the same value of @xmath37 , within a few % , as a calculation with fluctuating initial conditions averaged over many events , while event - by - event viscous hydrodynamic calculations show an even stronger correlation between initial anisotropy @xmath8 and @xmath7  @xcite .    in order to estimate quantitatively the dependence of @xmath37 over the initial profile , we use two different definitions of @xmath8 , weighted either with energy density ( as in eq .",
    "( [ defepsilon ] ) ) or with entropy density .",
    "both weightings yield approximately equally good predictors of @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "so any difference in prediction from one weighting versus the other is an indication of the size of the uncertainty due to the linear approximation . for central collisions , the particular deformation that we choose to create triangular flow , eq .",
    "( [ deformation ] ) , gives the exactly same value of @xmath1 irrespective of whether one weights with entropy or energy  @xcite : therefore our calculation is unable to tell the difference between the two .",
    "however , values of @xmath0 differ for the optical glauber model , and we use the resulting difference in @xmath21 as part of our error bar .",
    "the thermalization time @xmath38 , at which hydrodynamics becomes a good approximation  @xcite , is poorly constrained .",
    "early calculations  @xcite used to neglect transverse flow for @xmath39 ( where @xmath38 is typically of order 1  fm / c ) . however , the transverse expansion starts immediately after the collision , whether or not the system thermalizes .",
    "this `` initial flow '' has proven essential in understanding interferometry data  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is to some extent universal  @xcite and can be obtained simply , in a traditional calculation with vanishing flow at @xmath38 , by letting @xmath38 go to unrealistically small values  @xcite . in order to estimate the uncertainty due to initial flow",
    ", we run two sets of calculations with @xmath40  fm / c and @xmath41  fm / c : linearity of initial transverse flow at early times  @xcite can then be used to extrapolate to smaller values .",
    "fluid expansion : _ the main source of uncertainty in the hydrodynamic evolution itself is the value of the shear viscosity of the strongly - interacting quark - gluon plasma , which is poorly constrained so far , either from theory  @xcite or experiment  @xcite .",
    "we take this uncertainty into account by varying @xmath4 from @xmath42 to @xmath43 in steps of @xmath44 . if @xmath4 is too large , hydrodynamics itself breaks down  @xcite .",
    "effects of bulk viscosity  @xcite on the integrated flow are smaller  @xcite , even though the bulk viscosity may be large for some values of the temperature  @xcite .",
    "second - order corrections  @xcite have a negligible effect  @xcite .",
    "hadronic stage : _ eventually , the fluid expands and can be described as a gas of hadrons with collective and thermal motion . an open question in the description of the hadronic phase is to what extent hydrodynamics is a valid approach .",
    "instead , a common approach at rhic energies was to couple hydrodynamics to a hadronic `` afterburner '' simulating hadronic decays and two - body collisions  @xcite .",
    "although these afterburners usually have little affect on integrated properties of unidentified hadrons , this approach has proven useful for reproducing the elliptic flow and momentum spectra of identified particles .",
    "hadronic afterburners are also being implemented at lhc energies  @xcite .",
    "besides , it has been pointed out that hydrodynamics with bulk viscosity in the hadronic phase  @xcite also succeeds in reproducing identified particle properties  @xcite .    in this paper , we assume for simplicity that hydrodynamics still applies in the hadronic phase , with a single freeze - out temperature  @xcite . when changing the initial time in the hydrodynamic calculation , we tune the freeze - out temperature in such a way that the average transverse momentum of charged particles @xmath45 is unchanged : smaller values of @xmath38",
    "thus imply larger freeze - out temperatures .",
    "we neglect hadronic collisions below freeze - out , but resonance decays are taken into account .    in viscous hydrodynamics ,",
    "a significant source of uncertainty is the momentum distribution at freeze - out , which deviates from a thermal distribution due to the viscous correction  @xcite .",
    "the momentum dependence of this viscous correction involves microscopic information about hadronic cross - sections  @xcite .",
    "the quadratic ansatz  @xcite is the most commonly used .",
    "however , a linear ansatz gives better agreement with @xmath16 data  @xcite . in order to estimate the uncertainty associated with the modeling of freeze - out , we perform two sets of calculations with the linear and quadratic ansatz .",
    "the code we use to solve hydrodynamics is the same as in ref .",
    "@xcite , with resonance decays taken into account after freeze - out .",
    "we compute @xmath2 and @xmath3 for outgoing hadrons using similar experimental cuts as the experimental data that we compare to .",
    "specifically , the alice collaboration  @xcite analyzes @xmath7 for all charged hadrons in transverse momentum range @xmath46  gev / c and pseudorapidity range @xmath47 .",
    "the phenix collaboration  @xcite uses the cuts @xmath48  gev / c and @xmath49 .",
    "since our model has longitudinal boost invariance , our results are independent of rapidity . because of the difference in rapidity and pseudorapidity , however",
    ", the cut in @xmath50 must be taken into account in a precision calculation  @xcite .",
    "it typically increases @xmath2 by 3% and @xmath3 by 4% .",
    "an additional subtlety of the alice analysis is that the method uses pair correlations , with a pseudorapidity gap @xmath51 between particles in the pair in order to suppress nonflow correlations  @xcite .",
    "the analysis thus excludes particles at @xmath52 , and gives more weight to particles near the boundary @xmath53 , since all _ pairs _ are weighted identically .",
    "we also take into account this additional cut in @xmath54 , which typically decreases @xmath2 by 0.3% and @xmath3 by 0.4% .     implied by hydrodynamic calculations in combination with alice data for the 5% most central pb - pb collisions at @xmath6  tev .",

    "the shaded band is the area between two curves of the type ( [ powerlaw ] ) with @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where the values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 are chosen such that all hydro points lie within the band . ]",

    "@xmath66 is the ratio of the relative change in @xmath2 to the relative change in @xmath3 when @xmath4 increases .",
    "the fact that @xmath67 expresses that viscosity has a smaller effect on @xmath2 than on @xmath3 .",
    "other sources of uncertainty in the hydrodynamic prediction result in uncertainties in the coefficient @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ powerlaw ] ) .",
    "switching from the quadratic to the linear freeze - out ansatz has a very small effect , which is visible only for the largest values of @xmath4 . adding initial flow by starting the evolution earlier , at @xmath40  fm / c , yields more flow for a given value of @xmath4 , resulting in smaller values of @xmath8 .",
    "although this result may seem natural , it is not trivial as it looks : the freeze - out temperature is adjusted so as to match the @xmath68 spectrum , so that smaller @xmath38 goes along earlier freeze - out .",
    "both effects essentially compensate each other at rhic energies  @xcite , so that final results were insensitive to @xmath38 .",
    "the situation is different at lhc energies : in general , hydrodynamic results are less sensitive to the hadronic phase  @xcite and to the freeze - out temperature , which results in a stronger sensitivity of @xmath8 to initial flow .    in general , the takeaway message is that any effect that causes stronger collective flow tends to increase both @xmath0 and @xmath1 in such a way that the coefficient @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ powerlaw ] ) is almost unchanged .",
    "in fact , the largest contribution to the thickness of the uncertainty band comes not from properties of the medium or physical parameters , but instead from the linear - response approximation itself : weighting with entropy rather than energy yields slightly smaller values of @xmath0 , while @xmath1 remains the same .",

    "we now use the values of the rms ellipticity @xmath0 and triangularity @xmath1 obtained from data and hydrodynamic calculations as a filter for existing models of the initial state .",
    "since @xmath1 is solely created by fluctuations of the initial geometry  @xcite , in order to be consistent with data there is a trivial requirement that models take these fluctuations into account  typically these are monte - carlo models .",
    "the simplest is the glauber model  @xcite , where each participant nucleon adds a contribution to the initial density with gaussian shape ( in x and y ) and width @xmath71  fm , a value commonly used in event - by - event hydrodynamic calculations  @xcite .",
    "we use the phobos monte - carlo glauber  @xcite , though other implementations exist  @xcite .",
    "each participant can be given equal weight ( referred to as `` glauber @xmath72 '' ) , or a weight proportional to its number of collisions ( referred to as `` glauber @xmath73 '' scaling ) , or a linear combination of the two , adjusted to match observed multiplicity spectra ( default version , referred to simply as `` glauber '' ) at rhic  @xcite and lhc  @xcite .",
    "another class of initial state models , which generically go under the name cgc , implement the idea of parton saturation  @xcite .",
    "they generally predict a larger @xmath0  @xcite . in the earliest monte - carlo implementation  @xcite , which we denote by mc - kln ,",
    "the source of fluctuations is essentially the same as in glauber models , resulting in similar values of @xmath1 .",
    "recent works tend to incorporate additional sources of fluctuations , at the subnucleonic level  @xcite , resulting in general in larger @xmath1 . specifically , we test the mc - rcbk model which incorporates negative binomial fluctuations in nucleon - nucleon collisions  @xcite , the dipsy model  @xcite which incorporates a bfkl gluon cascade , and the ip - glasma model  @xcite which involves a classical yang - mills description of early - time gluon fields .    in all cases ,",
    "centrality bins are assigned according to the total entropy of each monte carlo event , which corresponds closely to the total multiplicity that would be obtained after hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "since the experimental centrality selection is also closely related to multiplicity , any systematics from centrality selection adds a negligible uncertainty and does not affect any of the following conclusions    predictions of these initial - state models are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : eps2eps3 ] , together with constrains from data and hydrodynamics .",
    "they are generally in the ballpark for all centralities .",
    "all models predict a strong increase of the rms @xmath0 with centrality percentile ( as the overlap area between colliding nuclei becomes more elongated ) and a mild increase of the rms @xmath1 , driven by the decrease in the system size  @xcite .",
    "the evolution from rhic to lhc at the same centrality depends on the model .",
    "the glauber model predicts a decrease of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 by a few % , which is only partially explained by the increase in system size from au to pb .",
    "the mc - rcbk predicts similar values at rhic and lhc .",
    "finally , dipsy predicts a mild increase of @xmath0 while @xmath1 is unchanged .",
    "( [ powerlaw ] ) provides a simple criterion for checking whether or not a particular model of initial conditions is compatible with data and hydrodynamics : one computes @xmath74 for this model , with @xmath69 ( @xmath75 ) at rhic ( lhc ) , and checks whether the result falls within the allowed band .",
    "this comparison is carried out in tables  [ table : rhic ] and [ table : lhc ] .",
    "one sees that the mc - kln is excluded for all centralities at rhic and lhc .",
    "it has already be noted that this particular model underpredicts @xmath3 at rhic if tuned to reproduce @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the mc - rcbk model is also excluded at rhic , and marginally allowed at lhc .",
    "the glauber model ( in its default version with a superposition of number of participants and number of binary collisions ) falls within the allowed band at rhic , but is excluded at lhc , except for the most central bin .",
    "dipsy and ip - glasma fall within the allowed region for all centralities , and so does the glauber model with pure binary collision scaling .",
    "the statement of whether a particular model of initial conditions is compatible with data or not turns out to be quite robust with respect to several ambiguities in the definitions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in the glauber model , for instance , one treats each participant as a `` source '' , whose width @xmath76 is a free parameter .",
    "there is also a similar ambiguity due to the unknown thermalization time : if one lets the system evolve for some time @xmath38 before evaluating @xmath8 , the values of @xmath8 depend on @xmath38 .",
    "if one doubles the value of @xmath76 , from 0.4 to 0.8  fm  @xcite , @xmath0 decreases by 6% and @xmath1 decreases by 9% for central collision , but the ratios in tables  [ table : rhic ] and [ table : lhc ] only change by 2% and 1% respectively . this can be easily understood .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that the smearing of the sources only affects the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ defepsilon ] ) , while leaving the numerator unchanged : thus the only effect of source smearing is a small increase in the system size , resulting in smaller @xmath8 . since @xmath77 , @xmath8 decreases in such a way that the ratio @xmath78 remains constant . comparing with eq .",
    "( [ powerlaw ] ) , where @xmath66 is close to @xmath79 , one sees that smearing results in a displacement of ( @xmath80 ) almost parallel to the allowed band : more or less smearing does not yield better or worse agreement with data .",
    "elliptic and triangular flow , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , are determined by the ellipticity @xmath0 and triangularity @xmath1 of the initial density profile , and by the linear hydrodynamic response to these initial anisotropies .",

    "we have obtained the corresponding uncertainties on the rms @xmath0 and @xmath1 at rhic and lhc energies .",
    "they are strongly correlated , so that region allowed by data reduces in practice to a band in the @xmath81 plane .",
    "we have described a simple test that can be performed on any candidate model of initial conditions to determine its compatibility with data .    while the main source of uncertainty in the hydrodynamic response is the viscosity over entropy ratio @xmath4 ,",
    "the uncertainty on the early stages is also significant .",
    "both are correlated , in the sense that more initial flow can be compensated by a larger viscosity . for this reason ,",
    "it is easier to constrain models of initial conditions than @xmath4 .",
    "we have shown that elliptic and triangular flow data can be used to exclude existing models of initial conditions .",
    "however , it is very difficult to constrain the granularity  @xcite of initial conditions from these data . as exemplified by monte - carlo glauber simulations",
    ", changing the source size has a modest effect on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , the resulting change has almost exactly the same effect as changing the viscosity , which is unknown .",
    "therefore it is unlikely that the granularity can be constrained with just elliptic and triangular flow data as long as @xmath4 is not precisely known .",
    "other data can be used for this purpose , such as the detailed structure of 2-particle correlations  @xcite .",
    "the width of our error band is mostly due to the error on the linear response approximation itself , with the set of initial conditions that we have tested .",
    "note that the deformation that we introduce to generate triangular flow , eq .",
    "( [ deformation ] ) , is singular at the origin . with realistic initial conditions",
    ", one usually observes a stronger linear correlation between @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) then with our smooth initial conditions  @xcite .",
    "repeating the calculation with realistic initial conditions could thus help reduce the width of the error band and yield tighter constraints on initial - state models .",
