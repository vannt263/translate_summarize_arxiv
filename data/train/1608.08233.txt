    "in a recent review @xcite the cross sections of @xmath0-induced reactions for target nuclei in the mass range @xmath1 were studied . for comparison of cross sections of different targets at various energies the method of reduced cross sections @xmath2  and",
    "reduced energies @xmath3  @xcite was used : @xmath9 the reduced energy @xmath3  takes into account the different heights of the coulomb barrier in the systems under consideration , whereas the reduced reaction cross section @xmath2  scales the measured total reaction cross section @xmath10  according to the geometrical size of the projectile - plus - target system .",
    "( all energies are given as @xmath11 except explicitly noted . ) in the @xmath1 mass range under study the total reaction cross section @xmath10  can often be taken from the dominating ( @xmath0,@xmath12 )  or ( @xmath0,@xmath13 )  reaction channel .",
    "it was found in @xcite that most of the experimental cross sections show a general and smooth trend for @xmath2  _ vs. _  @xmath3 .",
    "the two outliers @xmath4ar and @xmath5ar show significantly smaller cross sections ; however , this finding is based only on one very old experiment @xcite . surprisingly , two recent experiments on @xmath6na @xcite and @xmath7s @xcite show unexpected huge cross sections .",
    "in addition , the data for @xmath6na @xcite show a steeper energy dependence , and the data for @xmath7s show a flatter energy dependence compared to most of the other nuclei in this mass region .",
    "the present study presents two extensions to the recent review @xcite .",
    "first , a relation between the reduced energy @xmath3  and the most effective energy @xmath8 for astrophysical reaction rates ( the so - called gamow window ) is derived .",
    "second , the review @xcite is updated with two data sets for the previous outlier @xmath6na which were presented at this npa-7 conference @xcite and have been published now @xcite . these new data for @xmath6na show that @xmath6na should not be considered as outlier any more .",
    "some further information on the other outlier @xmath7s was already given in @xcite .",
    "the astrophysical reaction rate @xmath14@xmath15  is defined by the maxwellian - averaged cross section @xmath15 @xmath16 for an energy - independent astrophysical @xmath17-factor  the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate ] ) shows a maximum at the energy @xmath8 which is given by @xmath18 with the charge numbers @xmath19 and @xmath20 of projectile and target , the reduced mass number @xmath21 , and the plasma temperature @xmath22 in @xmath23kelvin .",
    "although it has been shown that the underlying simple approximation @xmath24 does not hold exactly @xcite , the energy @xmath8 is still a reasonable estimate for the most effective energy , and the energy window around @xmath8 is usually called gamow window .    according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ered ] ) , the corresponding reduced energy @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 where the function @xmath27 is given by @xmath28^{1/3 } } \\label{eq : f}\\ ] ] from the exponents of @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) already a relatively smooth dependence of @xmath25 on the mass and charge numbers of projectile and target can be expected . a closer inspection of eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) shows that there is a further compensation between the first and second factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) which leads to a reduced gamow energy @xmath25 which is almost independent of target charge and mass for @xmath0-induced reactions ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) .",
    "the first factor increases from light nuclei ( with @xmath32 and thus @xmath33 ) towards heavier nuclei ( with @xmath34 or @xmath35 ) .",
    "the second factor decreases with increasing target mass number @xmath36 .",
    "some numerical examples for @xmath27 are @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 . in the mass range under study",
    "@xmath40 varies only by a few per cent , leading to @xmath41 for the mass range under study .",
    "explicitly , the numbers are @xmath42mev for @xmath43 , @xmath44mev for @xmath45 , and @xmath46mev for @xmath47 .",
    "the total reaction cross section of @xmath48 @xmath6na is dominated by the @xmath6na(@xmath0,@xmath13)@xmath49 mg reaction at low energies .",
    "the @xmath6na(@xmath0,@xmath12)@xmath49al reaction has a negative @xmath50-value of about @xmath51mev .",
    "two new experimental data sets for the @xmath6na(@xmath0,@xmath13)@xmath49 mg reaction have been presented at this npa-7 conference @xcite .",
    "the results of both experiments agree with each other , but are in disagreement with the previous result of @xcite .    at the aarhus accelerator forward",
    "kinematics was applied @xcite .",
    "the target composition of the nacl target was carefully monitored using rutherford scattering on @xmath6na and @xmath52cl .",
    "because of the relatively low beam current , no significant deterioration of the target was observed .",
    "angular distributions for the @xmath53 and @xmath54 protons were measured over a broad angular range .",
    "thus , the derived absolute cross sections of the @xmath6na(@xmath0,@xmath13)@xmath49 mg reaction should be reliable within the given uncertainties in @xcite which are of the order of @xmath55per cent .    at the isac facility at triumf",
    "a helium - filled gas cell was mounted in the tuda scattering chamber for a measurement in inverse kinematics @xcite .",
    "the number of target nuclei was controlled via the gas pressure , and the number of beam particles was measured by rutherford backscattering on the gas cell entrance window and an additionally mounted thin gold foil .",
    "also this procedure should lead to a reliable absolute normalization of these experimental data .",
    "absolute uncertainties of slightly below 20% at higher energies and about @xmath56% at the lowest energies are reported in @xcite .     reduced cross section",

    "thus , the data show a relatively smooth energy dependence because of the averaging of the cross section in a broad energy interval .",
    "the high data point of the aarhus experiment at @xmath61mev corresponds to a strong resonance which has been seen also in earlier experiments @xcite .",
    "the new data are shown together with previous data for the @xmath6na(@xmath0,@xmath13)@xmath49 mg @xcite and @xmath6na(@xmath0,@xmath12)@xmath49al reactions @xcite in fig .",

    "[ fig : sred ] shows the same data as reduced cross sections @xmath2  vs.  reduced energies @xmath3 .",
    "here it has been found in @xcite that there is a smooth trend for increased @xmath2  towards lower target masses .",
    "the typical range of @xmath2  for the @xmath1 mass range is indicated by three calculations for the total reaction cross sections of @xmath48 @xmath57ne , @xmath48 @xmath4ar , and @xmath48 @xmath58v ( full lines from left to right in fig .",
    "[ fig : sred ] ; for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the new data of @xcite are located very close to the expectation from systematics .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that @xmath0-induced reaction cross sections for targets in the @xmath1 mass range show a relatively smooth and systematic behavior .",
    "this behavior can be nicely visualized using so - called reduced cross sections @xmath2  and reduced energies @xmath3 .",
    "the present work provides a simple relation between the reduced energy @xmath3  and the most effective energy @xmath8 for astrophysical reaction rates ( the so - called gamow window ) .",
    "four exceptions from the general systematics of @xmath0-induced reaction cross sections have been identified in @xcite : @xmath4ar and @xmath5ar with smaller cross sections @xcite",
    ", @xmath6na @xcite and @xmath7s @xcite with larger cross sections .",
    "new data @xcite for @xmath6na which have been presented first at this npa-7 conference @xcite supersede the previous data @xcite .",
    "contrary to the previous data by @xcite , these new data @xcite indicate a regular behavior of @xmath6na .",
    "new data for the remaining outliers @xmath4ar , @xmath5ar ( and @xmath63ar where no data are available ) and @xmath7s would be helpful to confirm or reject the irregular behavior of these nuclei .    during review of this paper ,",
    "an erratum was published by almarez - calderon _ et al .",
    "the erratum states that the @xmath6na(@xmath0,@xmath13)@xmath49 mg data of @xcite have to be scaled down by a factor of 0.01 , thus bringing these data into agreement with the later data in @xcite .",
