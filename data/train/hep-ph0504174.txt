    "<S> we calculate the screening potential of a fast parton moving through a quark - gluon plasma in the framework of semi - classical transport theory . </S>",
    "<S> we found an anisotropic potential showing a minimum in the direction of the parton velocity . </S>",
    "<S> possible consequences of this potential on binary states in a quark - gluon plasma are discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> screening of charges in a plasma is an important collective effect in plasma physics . in a classical isotropic and homogeneous plasma </S>",
    "<S> the screening potential of a point - like test charge @xmath0 at rest is modified from coulomb potential into a yukawa potential @xcite as @xmath1 with the debye mass ( inverse screening length ) @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) . in the quark - gluon plasma </S>",
    "<S> the debye mass of a chromoelectric charge follows from the static limit of the longitudinal polarization tensor which in the high temperature limit and one loop order is given by @xcite , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the strong coupling constant and @xmath6 the number of light quark flavors in the qgp with @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> the modification of the confinement potential below the critical temperature into a yukawa potential above the critical temperature might have important consequences for the discovery of the qgp in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> bound states of heavy quarks , in particular the @xmath8 meson , which are produced in the initial hard scattering processes of the collision , will be dissociated in the qgp due to screening of the quark potential and break - up by energetic gluons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence the suppression of @xmath8 mesons have been proposed as one of the most promising signatures for the qgp formation @xcite . on the other hand , the formation of colored bound states , _ </S>",
    "<S> e_.g . , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , of partons at rest has also been claimed  @xcite above the critical temperature ( 2@xmath12 - 3@xmath12 ) by analyzing lattice data , indicating that the plasma behaves as a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma .    </S>",
    "<S> earlier in most calculations of the screening potential in the qgp , the test charge was assumed to be at rest . </S>",
    "<S> however , quarks and gluons coming from initial hard processes receive a transverse momentum which causes them to propagate through the qgp @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , hydrodynamical models predict a radial outward flow in the fireball @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it is of great interest to estimate the screening potential of a parton moving  @xcite relatively to the qgp . </S>",
    "<S> chu and matsui @xcite have used the vlasov equation to investigate dynamic debye screening for a heavy quark - antiquark pair traversing a quark - gluon plasma . </S>",
    "<S> they found that the screening potential becomes strongly anisotropic .    </S>",
    "<S> the screening potential of a moving charge @xmath0 with velocity @xmath13 follows from the linearized vlasov and poisson equations as @xcite @xmath14 } } { k^2 { \\rm re}[\\epsilon_l ( \\omega={\\vec k}\\cdot { \\vec v } , k)]}. \\label{e4}\\ ] ] the dielectric function following from the semi - classical vlasov equation describing a collisionless plasma is related to the high - temperature limit of the polarization tensor . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the longitudinal dielectric function following from the vlasov equation is given by @xcite @xmath15 where the only non - classical inputs are fermi and bose distributions instead of the boltzmann distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the gluon self - energies derived within the hard thermal loop approximation  @xcite have been shown to be gauge invariant and the dielectric functions obtained from these are therefore also gauge invariant .    for small velocities , @xmath16 , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. @xmath17 , we obtain @xmath18 from which again the ( shifted ) yukawa potential results @xcite @xmath19 in the general case , for parton velocities @xmath13 between 0 and 1 , we have to solve ( [ e4 ] ) together with ( [ e3 ] ) numerically . </S>",
    "<S> since the potential is not isotropic anymore due to the velocity vector @xmath20 , we will restrict ourselves only to two cases , @xmath21 parallel to @xmath20 and @xmath21 perpendicular to @xmath20 , i.e. , for illustration we consider  @xcite the screening potential only in the direction of the moving parton or perpendicular to it .    </S>",
    "<S> in fig.1 the screening potential @xmath22 in @xmath20-direction is shown as a function of @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , between 0 and 6 fm for various velocities . </S>",
    "<S> for illustration we have chosen a strong fine structure constant @xmath25 , a temperature @xmath26 gev , and the number of quark flavors @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the shifted potentials depend only on @xmath13 and not on @xmath28 as it should be the case in a homogeneous and isotropic plasma . for @xmath29 fm one </S>",
    "<S> observes that the fall - off of the potential is stronger than for a parton at rest . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this behavior is the fact that there is a stronger screening in the direction of the moving parton due to an enhancement of the particle density in the rest frame of the moving parton .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a minimum in the screening potential at @xmath30 fm shows up . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for @xmath31 this minimum is at about 1.5 fm with a depth of about 8 mev . a minimum in the screening potential is also known from non - relativistic , complex plasmas , where an attractive potential even between equal charges can be found if the finite extension of the charges is considered @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a similar screening potential was found for a color charge at rest in ref.@xcite , where a polarization tensor beyond the high - temperature limit was used </S>",
    "<S> . however , this approach has its limitation as a gauge dependent and incomplete ( within the order of the coupling constant ) approximation for the polarization tensor was used @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , a minimum in the interparticle potential in a relativistic or non - relativistic plasma is a general feature if one goes beyond the debye - hckel approximation by either taking quantum effects , finite velocities , or finite sizes of the particles into account .    </S>",
    "<S> we also note that chu and matsui @xcite did not report the existence of a minimum in the potential of a quark traversing the qgp . </S>",
    "<S> however , in their fig.1(d ) a negative value of the potential of a fast quark ( @xmath32 ) in the direction of the quark velocity is shown . </S>",
    "<S> since the potential has to tend to zero for large distances , this implies a minimum in the screening potential . </S>",
    "<S> this minimum was not found because the potential was plotted only for the limited range @xmath33 fm for our choice of the parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> the minimum could give rise to bound states , e.g. , of diquarks , if thermal fluctuations do not destroy them . </S>",
    "<S> the two - body potential , associated with the dipole fields created by two test charges @xmath34 and @xmath35 at @xmath36 and @xmath37 with velocities @xmath38 and @xmath39 , can be written as @xmath40 } } { k^2 { \\rm re}[\\epsilon_l ( \\omega={\\vec k}\\cdot { \\vec v_1 } , k)]}\\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{e^{[i{\\vec k}\\cdot ( ( { \\vec r_1}-{\\vec r_2})-({\\vec v_1}-{\\vec v_2})t ) ] } } { k^2 { \\rm re}[\\epsilon_l ( \\omega={\\vec k}\\cdot { \\vec v_2 } , k)]}\\biggr \\}. \\label{e7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for comoving quarks , @xmath41 , this two - body potential reduces to the one - body potential ( [ e4 ] ) , showing the attraction between the quarks which could give rise to a bound state . colored bound states , e.g. , diquarks , of partons at rest </S>",
    "<S> have also been claimed by analyzing lattice data @xcite . for a comoving diquark system , where the interaction between two color charges @xmath42 , the two body potential shows an attractive minimum and </S>",
    "<S> may therefore indicate a possible appearance of a diquark bound state as compared to partons at rest where the two body potential is only repulsive . on the other hand , for a quark - antiquark system , where @xmath43 , the two - body potential is inverted , showing a maximum . </S>",
    "<S> this may lead to short living mesonic resonances and an enhancement of the attraction between quarks and antiquarks of mesonic states moving through the qgp .     screening potential perpendicular to the velocity of the moving parton in a qgp as a function of @xmath44 ( 0.1 to 1 fm ) for @xmath45 , 0.5 , and 0.8.,width=226,height=226 ]     screening potential perpendicular to the velocity of the moving parton in a qgp as a function of @xmath44 ( 0.1 to 1 fm ) for @xmath45 , 0.5 , and 0.8.,width=226,height=226 ]    </S>",
    "<S> the results for @xmath21 perpendicular to @xmath20 are shown in fig.2 , where the potential is shown as a function of @xmath46 between 0.1 and 1 fm . </S>",
    "<S> here we consider only the case @xmath47 since at @xmath48 and @xmath49 there is no singularity in the potential due to @xmath50 for all @xmath51 . hence the potential is cut - off artificially at small distances if plotted as a function of @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the parallel case ( fig.1 ) the fall - off of the potential at larger values of @xmath13 is less steep , i.e. the screening is reduced as it is expected since the formation of the screening cloud is suppressed at large velocities . also no minimum in the potential is found .    summarizing </S>",
    "<S> , we have calculated the screening potential of a fast color charge moving through the qgp from semi - classical transport theory corresponding to the high - temperature limit . as in ref.@xcite the potential </S>",
    "<S> is found to be strongly anisotropic . </S>",
    "<S> the screening is reduced in the perpendicular direction of the moving parton but increased in the direction of the moving parton , which may lead to a modification of the @xmath8 suppression . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we found a new feature of the screening potential of a fast parton in a qgp : a minimum in the potential shows up which could give rise to bound states of , for example , diquarks if not destroyed by thermal fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> for a quark - antiquark pair this minimum turns into a maximum which could cause short living mesonic resonances . combining the effect of reduced screening in perpendicular direction and the presence of a maximum in parallel direction we expect a stronger binding of moving @xmath8 mesons with respect to the qgp than of @xmath8 mesons at rest . </S>",
    "<S> the consequences , e.g , for the @xmath8 yield should be investigated in more detail using hydrodynamical models or event generators for the space - time evolution of the fireball . finally , let us note that our results also apply to other ultrarelativistic plasmas such as an electron - positron plasma in supernova explosions . in this case </S>",
    "<S> one simply has to replace the debye mass @xmath2 by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the electron charge . </S>"
