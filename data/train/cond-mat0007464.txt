    "dense nano - particle systems have been shown to exhibit collective behavior , as evidenced by aging , and non - equilibrium effects similar to spin glasses.@xcite whether that collective behavior is associated with a `` true '' spin glass phase transition is still controversial . in this paper , we show a dynamic scaling analysis to a spin glass transition for a highly concentrated fe - c nano - particle sample with a narrow particle size distribution .",
    "we also discuss why the scaling analysis may not indicate a phase transition for samples with less interactions or wider size distributions .    the sample consisted of ferromagnetic nanoparticles of amorphous @xmath5 ( x@xmath60.22 ) , with an average particle size of @xmath7 nm , prepared by the method described by van wonterghem et al . in ref .",
    "the sample was studied in the frozen state and contained 17 vol% of particles .",
    "the ac - susceptibility measurements were performed in a non - commercial squid magnetometer for frequencies in the range @xmath8 17  mhz - 170  hz . fig . 1 shows @xmath9 and @xmath10 at different frequencies .    a sample that exhibit a spin glass transition will show critical slowing down , and hence the characteristic relaxation time @xmath11 diverges at the transition temperature according to @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the transition temperature , @xmath14 is related to the relaxation time of the individual particle magnetic moments , and @xmath15 is a critical exponent .",
    "we extracted the freezing temperature @xmath16 , associated with a relaxation time ( @xmath17 ) , from the out - of - phase component of the ac - susceptibility as @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "we also tried other criteria to make sure that the choice of criterion is not significantly influencing the results of the critical slowing down analysis .",
    "the critical slowing down analysis gives @xmath1 , @xmath20  s , and @xmath21  k ( see fig .",
    "we also performed a full scaling of @xmath3 according to , @xmath22 and found data collapse to a single function @xmath23 , for different frequencies , using @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . the value of @xmath15 compares quite well with values found for spin glasses with long range interactions ( rkky ) , while the value of @xmath24 is slightly larger than typical spin glass values , but is consistent with the value of @xmath25 found by jonsson et al .",
    "@xcite for an interacting nanoparticle sample by a static scaling analysis .",
    "the dynamic scaling analysis will only reveal a phase transition if the single particle contribution to @xmath3 is vanishingly small for @xmath4 , i.e. all slow dynamics is due to collective behavior .",
    "two criteria have to be fulfilled for this to be possible ; i ) the interparticle interactions need to be strong and ii ) the particle size distribution needs to be narrow . if we compare the sample used for the scaling analysis with the same sample but much more dilute ( 0.05 vol.% ) we can see that the out - of - phase component is almost zero for @xmath4 ( see inset of fig .",
    "we conclude that the concentrated sample is appropriate to use for scaling analysis .",
