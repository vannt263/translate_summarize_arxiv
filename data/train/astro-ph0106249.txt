    "large star - to - star abundance variations in the light elements c , n , o , na , mg , and al are commonly found among the bright giant stars of metal - poor globular clusters .",
    "some star - to - star abundance variations exist in all metal - poor globular clusters in which the variations have been sought . in clusters with sufficiently large sample sizes , n is typically anti - correlated with o and c , na is anti - correlated with o , and al is anti - correlated with mg .",
    "the reader is referred to reviews by suntzeff ( 1993 ) , kraft ( 1994 ) , briley   ( 1994 ) , da  costa ( 1997 ) , wallerstein   ( 1997 ) , and sneden ( 1999 , 2000 ) for detailed discussions of these abundance trends . except for anti - correlated behavior of n with respect to o and c , halo field giants do not exhibit the variations in na , mg , and al that are seen among globular cluster giants ( pilachowski  1996a , hanson  1998 , gratton  2000 ) .",
    "most studies agree that the abundance anti - correlations found among cluster giants result from proton - capture nucleosynthesis that converts c and o into n , ne into na , and mg into al in and above the hydrogen - burning shells of evolved stars ( see , denissenkov  1990 ; cavallo & nagar 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "however it is less clear whether the synthesis takes place in the giants we presently observe ( the `` evolutionary '' scenario ) or in a prior generation of more massive evolved stars ( the `` primordial '' scenario ) which selectively `` polluted '' the gas from which the present generation of stars was formed .",
    "evidence mounts that both scenarios are needed : a typical cluster contains main sequence stars already imprinted with variations in these elements , as studies of main sequence stars in 47  tuc and ngc  6752 dramatically illustrate ( briley  1995 , gratton   2001 ) .",
    "these abundances may , however , be further modified when the stellar envelope is cycled through the h - burning shell as stars approach the red giant tip ( see reviews by briley   1994 , kraft 2001 and references therein ) .    in any given luminosity interval on the giant branch of a typical globular cluster ,",
    "there are stars with a range of na , o , mg , and al abundances , usually exhibiting the anti - correlations noted above .",
    "one possible expectation of the evolutionary scenario is that the distribution of these o and na ( or mg and al ) abundances should change with advancing evolutionary state .",
    "thus as evolution proceeds , one might expect to find relatively more stars with low o and mg and fewer with high o and mg , and correspondingly more with high na and al and fewer with low na and al .",
    "this is indeed the case for m13 ( kraft  1997 , hanson  1998 ) , in which there are different mean o , na , mg , and al abundances for stars above and below 0  @xmath3 1.7 ( or  @xmath3 1.0 ) , a point 0.8 mag below the red giant tip .",
    "for other clusters less is known because of flux limitations at faint magnitudes .",
    "but even in m13 , giants with 0  @xmath1 1.7 exhibit the same spread and distribution of na and al abundances ( pilachowski  1996b , cavallo & nagar 2000 ) , independent of luminosity , to levels one magnitude below the horizontal branch ( hb ) . in the more metal - poor clusters m92 and m15 , there is no apparent change in the distribution of na abundances with luminosity from the red giant tip to levels just above the hb ( sneden  2000 ) . in the more metal - rich cluster m4 , although the variations in c , n , o , na , mg , and al are smaller than in m13 , again the distributions show little dependence on evolutionary state ( ivans   1999 , hereafter called i99-m4 ) .",
    "m5 is a mildly metal - poor cluster ( @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1  = 1.4 , zinn & west 1984 ; @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1  = 1.17 , sneden   1992 ; @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1  = 1.11 , carretta & gratton 1997 ) in which bright giants exhibit anti - correlated behavior of c and o with respect to n ( smith   1997 ) , as well as an anti - correlation of o with na ( sneden  1992 , hereafter called s92-m5 ) ; al and mg abundance relationships have not been explored .",
    "the cluster exhibits bimodal distributions of cn - strength on both the first ascent giant branch ( `` rgb '' ; smith & norris 1983 ) and asymptotic giant branch ( `` agb '' ; smith & norris 1993 ) .",
    "at least one giant , iv-59 , is known to have both high n and o , which again suggests the existence of primordial variations ( smith  1997 ) . however , is there evidence for an increase in the number of o - poor and na - rich stars as evolutionary state advances ?",
    "previous m5 sample sizes have been too small to explore whether in this cluster a shift with @xmath4 exists in the distribution of na and o compatible with an evolutionary scenario .",
    "we report here an exploration of this question , based on high resolution spectra of a sample of 36 giants ranging in luminosity from the rgb tip to 0  @xmath5 0.5 , , about one magnitude above the hb .",
    "m4 , a cluster with metallicity comparable to that of m5 , has unusually high abundances of the @xmath6-element si , the light odd - z element al , and the @xmath7-process elements ba and la ( brown & wallerstein 1992 ; i99-m4 ) in comparison to typical halo field giants of similar metallicity ( see , gratton & sneden 1991 , 1994 , shetrone 1996 ) , which follow an extrapolation of the abundance trends seen among halo stars of lower metallicities ( see , mcwilliam  1995 , ryan  1996 and references therein ) .",
    "we therefore compare [ el / fe]-ratios in m5 with those in m4 and the halo field , noting that m5 pursues a galactic orbit with an apogalacticon in the outer reaches of the galactic halo ( cudworth & hanson 1993 ) , where clusters having `` abnormal '' [ el / fe ] ratios are sometimes found .",
    "we introduce here for the first time an analysis of cluster [ fe / h ] ratios based on an approach in which allowance is made for the over - ionization of fe in the atmospheres of low - metallicity giants .",
    "we estimate as well the effect of these non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( non - lte ) precepts on the derivation of [ el / fe ] ratios .",
    "abundances based on more traditional methods of analysis are , however , retained so that the reader may judge the extent of the proposed modifications .",
    "our prior study of 13 bright m5 giants ( s92-m5 ) was based on high resolution ( r  @xmath5 30,000 ) spectra obtained with the lick 3.0 m telescope and hamilton coud echelle spectrograph ( vogt 1987 ) . the faintest stars observed in the lick sample had v  @xmath5 13.0 , the practical limit for observations with signal - to - noise s / n  @xmath8 50 in reasonable integration times ( @xmath5120 minutes ) using the 3.0 m telescope .",
    "however , stars near 0  @xmath5 0.5 have @xmath9  @xmath5  14.0 in m5 ; obtaining spectra of high resolution and adequate s / n for such stars required use of the hires spectrograph of the keck  i telescope ( vogt   1994 ) .    for the keck observations ,",
    "the entrance slit was set to a width of 0.86@xmath10 , which corresponds to a spectral resolving power of r  @xmath3 45,000 at the tektronix 2048@xmath112048 pixel detector . in table",
    "[ m5.tab1 ] , we present an observing log of the 25 m5 giants observed with hires , along with estimated s / n near , values of @xmath12 , 0  and 0  for each star , assuming a reddening @xmath13  = 0.03 and a true distance modulus  = 14.40 ( djorgovski 1993 ) .",
    "we adopted the observed colors and magnitudes of sandquist  ( 1996 ; 2000 , private communication ) for all but three stars which were unobserved in the sandquist study .",
    "the photometry for star ii-9 was taken from cudworth ( 1979 ) and for star iii-149 , we used that of rees ( 1993 ) .",
    "g2 is discussed below .",
    "two of the stars observed at lick ( ii-85 and iv-47 ) were re - observed using hires at keck  i , in order to study possible systematic offsets in equivalent width ( ew ) and/or differences in analysis procedure between the lick and keck data .",
    "combining the two data sets , we are able to study abundances and abundance ratios in 36 m5 giants on both the rgb and agb , ranging in luminosity from @xmath14  @xmath3 1.0 to 3.4 , corresponding to an effective temperature range of  @xmath3 4750  k to 3900  k. of these 36 stars , 34 are proper motion members of m5 according to the catalog of rees ( 1993 ) ; the remainder have colors , magnitudes , abundances , and radial velocities compatible with membership ( discussed further in the next paragraph ) .",
    "eight of the stars are members of the agb ; a small fraction of stars brighter than @xmath9  = 12.8 ( @xmath520% , based on comparative lifetimes ) , in the region of the color - magnitude diagram where the rgb and agb can not be distinguished , may also be agb members . of 30 stars observed by us for which the cn strength index s(3839 ) has previously been measured by smith & norris ( 1983 , 1993 ) , briley & smith ( 1993 ) , and smith  ( 1997 ) , we observed 14 cn - strong stars and 16 cn - weak stars .",
    "altogether , we observed 29% of the 118 giants",
    "brighter than @xmath9  = 14.1 that were cataloged by rees , plus two additional members not in the catalog .",
    "our sample is thus reasonably representative of the population of bright m5 giants . in figure  [ m5.fig1 ]",
    "we exhibit the color - magnitude array of the brighter stars in m5 , based on the ccd photometry of sandquist   ( 1996 ; 2000 , private communication ) .",
    "this figure illustrates the evolutionary domain of our program stars .",
    "the labels in the figure identify the stars of this study plus those of s92-m5 .",
    "two stars listed in table  [ m5.tab1 ] require special comment .",
    "the one designated as g2 , close to the central region of the cluster , is not to be found in published photometry but was revealed as a bright red star in a 2@xmath15 image of the cluster kindly obtained by kirk gilmore using the lick 1.0 m telescope .",
    "g2 can be seen in the map ( figure  12 ) of buonanno  ( 1981 ) and its estimated position is @xmath6(1950 )  = 15@xmath1616@xmath1704@xmath18 , @xmath19(1950 )  = + 02@xmath2014@xmath2154@xmath10 .",
    "it is a radial velocity member .",
    "a second star , listed here as `` iii-149 '' to prevent confusion , was accidentally observed in the mistaken belief that it was iii-147 .",
    "it is actually the star , not numbered in buonanno , lying 10@xmath10 west and 4@xmath10 south of iii-147 , essentially at the right - hand edge of figure  12 of buonanno _ et al . _",
    "it too is a radial velocity member of m5 .",
    "processing of the raw spectra was carried out using the standard iraf software package .",
    "the ccd frames were corrected for both bias and flat - field effects and the individual orders were extracted .",
    "further analysis was performed using the spectre code ( fitzpatrick & sneden 1987 ) ; this involved continuum placement and normalization , cosmic ray removal , a wavelength calibration using stellar absorption lines within each order and removal of telluric absorption features using spectra of hot , rapidly - rotating , essentially featureless stars .",
    "the interested reader will find additional details of our standard procedures in earlier papers by this group ( see , sneden  1991 , i99-m4 ) .",
    "our nominal hires wavelength coverage is 5400    @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath22",
    "6700   , but the free spectral ranges of the echelle orders are larger than can be recorded by the 2048@xmath112048 pixel detector , so that features of some key elements are inevitably lost in the order interstices . in the 1994/5 observations ,",
    "the grating was set to permit both and lines to be recorded in a study of m13 giants .",
    "unfortunately , the radial velocities of m5 and m13 are sufficiently different that for the m13 grating setting , lines of in m5 were shifted into the region between orders , and were therefore not recorded . on the other hand ,",
    "the grating setting employed for the 1998 observations of m5 permitted observations of the lines , but not the lines .",
    "we measured ews for all lines of interest by one of two techniques : direct integration of the flux across the observed line profile , or by adopting the ew of a gaussian profile fitted to the line .",
    "the lines chosen for analysis in the to wavelength interval and their adopted @xmath24-values are the same as those used in the previous paper of this series ( i99-m4 ) .",
    "we list the atomic parameters and corresponding reference for each line in table  [ m5.tab10 ] in the appendix , where further discussion of the linelist is to be found .",
    "ews of all measured lines can be obtained electronically by request to the authors .",
    "they are also available at the astronomical data center ( adc ) at nasa goddard space flight center ( http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov/adc/archive_search.html ) . for the @xmath255682 ,",
    "5688    doublet we based the abundance of na on a synthetic spectrum fit , rather than ew measurements , since the lines in question are blended with other metallic species .",
    "we also checked by spectrum synthesis the o result obtained from the ew measurements of the [ ] @xmath256300 , 6364    doublet , employing interpolated c and n abundances as a function of o from smith   ( 1997 ) .",
    "our vanadium abundances are derived from blended - line ew computations of @xmath256275 , 6285    for which we employed well - determined hyperfine structure components from mcwilliam ( 2001 , private communication ) , which are slightly revised from those of mcwilliam & rich ( 1994 ) , normalizing the @xmath24-values to those adopted for these lines in previous studies by our group .",
    "finally , following the same ba abundance analysis that was performed in i99-m4 , the blended - line ew analysis of the lines at @xmath255854 , 6142 , 6497    includes both hyperfine and isotopic subcomponents adopted from mcwilliam ( 1998 ) .",
    "similarly , in this study , we assume the solar abundance ratios among the @xmath26ba isotopes in the calculations .",
    "the preliminary analysis of the observational data from the keck  i hires spectrograph followed the standard procedure of our earlier m5 paper ( s92-m5 ) . in that study ,",
    "the values of @xmath9 and @xmath27 given by cudworth ( 1979 ) , and the relationship between 0  color and   that had been adopted by cudworth were used to provide a first estimate of  for each program star . the adopted color excess @xmath13",
    "= 0.03 and true distance modulus  = 14.03 were those recommended by sandage & cacciari ( 1990 ) . in the present analysis , we used the values of @xmath9 and @xmath27 given by sandquist  ( 1996 ; 2000 , private communication ) .",
    "we adopted the same color excess but the revised true distance modulus of  = 14.40 ( djorgovski 1993 ) was employed in preliminary estimates of  obtained using the relationship obtained by combining the gravitation law with stefan s law . in s92-m5 , the bolometric corrections of bell & gustafsson ( 1978 ) were employed but here we interpolated g.  worthey s bolometric corrections ( 1994 , private communication ) , in order to be consistent with the previous paper of this series ( see i99-m4 for details ) .",
    "armed with these preliminary estimates of  and , we employed the current version of the moog line analysis code ( sneden 1973 ) to compute abundances from ews on a line - by - line basis . for the various choices of  and  we calculated trial model atmospheres generated with the marcs code ( gustafsson   1975 ) .",
    "anticipating from s92-m5 that @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1 would be near 1.2 , we took our input metallicity at [ fe / h ]  = 1.0 , in order to simulate an overall @xmath6-element enhancement relative to fe of @xmath50.2 to 0.3 dex , since the models were originally calculated for [ @xmath6/fe ]  = 0.0 .",
    "a discussion of the validity of this approximation is found in fulbright & kraft ( 1999 ) .",
    "final model atmosphere parameters were determined , as before , by iteration , through satisfying the following requirements : ( a ) for , that the abundances of individual lines show no trend with excitation potential ; ( b ) for microturbulent velocity @xmath28 , that the abundances show no trend with ew ; and ( c ) for , that the [ fe / h ] abundance ratios derived from the and lines should not differ by more than 0.05  dex .",
    "the iterated model parameters are given in table  [ m5.tab2 ] ; the values listed for [ fe / h ] in the traditional approach are a mean of determinations based on and .",
    "it is important to note in the iterative process that the `` final '' values of  and  may be fairly different from the estimated `` input '' values .",
    "once  is set ,  is constrained by the necessity to force close agreement in the [ fe / h ] values determined from and .",
    "alternatively , once a  is found to satisfy the ionization equilibrium , the teff is constrained to force agreement in the fe  i abundances for lines of different excitation potentials . finally there is the additional constraint that [ fe / h ] can not be allowed to vary systematically over the range of  and   represented by the stars in the sample .",
    "inspection of the preliminary atmospheric parameters in table  [ m5.tab2 ] gives rise to concerns .",
    "first , giants lying in the same  range ( 3900  k to 4300  k ) as those studied in s92-m5 have @xmath0@xmath1 that is @xmath50.5  dex lower than the values given in that paper . the increase in  from 14.03 to 14.40",
    "should have instead lowered @xmath0@xmath1 by only 0.15 dex .",
    "second , the mean [ fe / h ] ratio is 0.15  dex lower among the six agb stars than among the 13 rgb stars .",
    "thus for the agb we derive @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1  = 1.45  @xmath29  0.01 ( @xmath30  = 0.03 ) , whereas for the rgb we derive 1.30  @xmath29  0.01 ( @xmath30  = 0.04 ) . since a real physical reduction in fe abundance from the rgb to the agb is surely not expected in stars of such low mass , the result clearly points to some inadequacy in our analysis procedure .",
    "we list the [ el / fe ] ratios derived in this traditional approach in the appendix as table  [ m5.tab11 ] where the values of [ el / fe ] are those based on the mean of and abundances .",
    "we also investigated our abundance results in the context of possible mass loss or chromospheric activity in the atmospheres of our giant stars . in all but two of the keck spectra",
    ", h-@xmath6 was just barely recorded on the blue edge of the chip .",
    "stars i-20 ,",
    "g2 , iv-81 , iv-19 , and iii-149 all show some h-@xmath6 emission in the blue wing . of these stars , i-20 is apparently an agb star ; the rest are on the tip of the giant branch .",
    "unfortunately , most of the na  d doublet is unrecorded for these stars ( the spectra are cut off redward of the blue wing of na  d2 ) .",
    "the two keck spectra which are offset in wavelength from the rest do , however , have the na  d doublet recorded .",
    "stars ii-85 and iv-47 , both on the tip of the giant branch , show core shifts in both na  d lines . with a very conservative error of @xmath292  , we derive for the d2 lines a shift of 9.8  and for d1 , 7.6 and 9.7  , for stars ii-85 and iv-47 , respectively . that the bluer d2 line may show a slightly higher blueshift is in accord with its formation higher in the atmosphere , and is thus more susceptible to any outward flows in the higher atmosphere regions ( see , bates  1993 and references therein )",
    ".      `` for many years , the techniques used in stellar abundance determinations have remained essentially unchanged , despite a rather passionate controversy in the late fifties and early sixties [ ... ] that departures from lte could lead to abundances substantially different from those given by the ` classical ' lte approach '' ( dumont  1975 ) .",
    "detailed investigations since have confirmed not only the effect on derived abundances but also on the derived stellar parameters ( see , hearnshaw 1976 , luck & lambert 1985 , fuhrmann   1997 , allende  prieto  1999 , fulbright 2000 , the latter three studies based on _ hipparcos _ [ esa 1997 ] results ) .",
    "the largest effect on stellar parameters is on the derived gravity : gravities derived by forcing ionization equilibrium ( spectroscopic gravity ) are lower than those derived by stellar parallaxes ( trigonometric gravity ) or by the evolutionary position in the hr - diagram ( evolutionary gravity ) .",
    "we confirm this gravity anomaly in our lte analysis of the m5 giant stars and discuss the anomaly further in this section .",
    "recently , thvenin & idiart ( 1999 , hereafter ti99 ) have explored in detail the problem of fe over - ionization in the atmospheres of metal - poor stars . for over - ionized atmospheres , application of standard lte model atmospheres to abundance analysis of will always lead to an underestimate of [ fe / h ] .",
    "ti99 point out that at any given optical depth , the populations of the atomic levels of are governed not by the local kinetic temperature but rather are modified by the outward leakage of uv photons into an atmosphere made progressively less opaque as metallicity is decreased .",
    "the metallicity dependence is not surprising : it has been known for some time that for a given optical depth , lower metallicity stars have a larger physical depth ( see , wallerstein 1962 ) and the optical depth thus reaches hotter layers of the atmosphere .",
    "fortunately , the abundance of fe derived from remains relatively unaffected , since in metal - poor stars , virtually all fe is already in the form of .",
    "the ti99 calculations suggest that the reduction of [ fe / h ] estimated from relative to amounts to about 0.1  dex at [ fe / h ]  = 1.0 but rises to about 0.3  dex at [ fe / h ]  = 2.5 . for similar reasons ,",
    "the leakage of uv photons should also become larger with lower atmospheric densities , , surface gravities , at a given , and with higher  values at a given luminosity .",
    "thus one might anticipate that should the ti99 effect be real , traditional analyses of agb stars could well lead to lower overall estimates of [ fe / h ] based on , as compared with rgb stars .",
    "a smaller , but still noticeable , `` dragging down '' of [ fe / h ] would occur when [ fe / h ] is estimated from the mean of and determinations .",
    "could this effect account for the anomalous apparent drop in [ fe / h ] among m5 agb stars ?",
    "we decided to test this possibility in three ways : first , by modifying our fe linelist to exclude all but the weakest lines ; second , by modifying the linelist to exclude all but the highest excitation potential lines ; and third , by modifying the procedure used to define the stellar parameters . by gradually culling the lines in descending order of equivalent width , we found a small but steady increase in the microturbulent velocity required to satisfy the ew equilibrium constraint but , no significant change in either the to ratio or in the overall iron abundance .",
    "gradual deletions of lines in ascending order of excitation potential had no significant effect on the ratio or abundance and the changes in @xmath28 were up or down , depending on the subset of lines in use in a given trial . finally , we modified our procedure for estimating the input values of  and  in the following way .",
    "first , we set aside any reference to the spectrum in estimating  and replaced it with values of  derived from 0 , using the calibration of alonso   ( 1999 ; their table  6 , interpolating the computed table values ) .",
    "this scale , based on the infra - red flux method ( `` irfm '' ; blackwell   1990 and references therein ) , applies to low - mass , metal - poor giants .",
    "we then assigned to each star the value of  it should have , as predicted from stellar models coupled to stellar evolution . to each star on the rgb",
    ", we assigned a mass of 0.80  , and to each star on the agb a mass of 0.70  , thus allowing for the mass loss expected in very late evolutionary stages .",
    "we took @xmath13  = 0.03 ,  = 14.40 , and calculated  from the relationship @xmath31  @xmath5  @xmath32@xmath33/l , interpolating g.wortheys bolometric corrections ( 1994 , private communication ) .",
    "the observed values of @xmath9 and @xmath27 used in s92-m5 were replaced by modern ccd - based values of sandquist  ( 1996 ; 2000 , private communication ) .    in table",
    "[ m5.tab2 ] we show a comparison of  and  values derived from the `` traditional '' approach based on the and line spectrum and the revised approach based on the alonso  ( 1999 ) color versus -scale and stellar evolutionary arguments . for the 13 rgb stars and 6 agb stars , we find @xmath19  = + 26  @xmath29  10  k and @xmath19  = + 35  @xmath29  18  k respectively , in the sense `` new '' @xmath34 `` traditional '' . the difference between  based on the excitation plot and  based on the alonso  color -- scale is very small and the effect on the abundances of fe derived from and is essentially negligible . thus an increase in  of 30  k increases by 0.02  dex and decreases by 0.04  dex .",
    "but the change in  has a more substantial effect ; we find @xmath19  = + 0.28  @xmath29  0.04 for the rgb sample and virtually the same result , @xmath19  = + 0.34  @xmath29  0.06 for the agb sample , again in the sense `` new '' @xmath34 `` traditional '' .",
    "such a gravity change tends to drive the derived fe abundances from and apart : for @xmath19  = + 0.30 , we expect @xmath19  @xmath3 0.02 and @xmath19  @xmath3 + 0.15 .",

    "inspection of this table , one can easily see the scope of the dilemma .",
    "the excitation plot yields essentially the same  values as the alonso  ( 1999 ) -scale , in turn based on the irfm .",
    "it therefore seems unlikely this temperature scale is seriously in error .",
    "if the disagreement between the spectroscopic gravities , based on forced agreement between and abundances , and the evolutionary gravities is due to a defect in estimating the latter , then the evolutionary  would need to be decreased by @xmath50.3  dex .",
    "this would in turn imply that the distance modulus of m5 is too small , and needs to be increased by 0.75  dex , , to  = 15.15 .",
    "such an increase in the distance modulus would be seriously at odds with recent estimates based on fitting of the m5 main sequence to the main sequence of mildly metal - poor subdwarfs having accurate _ hipparcos_-based parallaxes .",

    ", conflicting evidence is found from a study of near - uv fluxes and flux distributions of metal - poor stars by allende  prieto & lambert ( 2000 ) .",
    "their investigation contains 15 stars in common with alonso   ( 1996 ) and having [ fe / h ] @xmath0 0.5 with 4000k @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath38 6000k ( omitting the spectroscopically peculiar dwarfs hd134439 and hd25329 ) . for these 15 stars",

    "we also investigated the effects of adopting the color-  calibration of sekiguchi & fukugita ( 2000 ) . for stars with temperatures that correspond to the warmer m5 stars in our sample , the sekiguchi & fukugita color-  calibration produces temperatures @xmath550k hotter than the other calibrations .",

    "whether adoption of these models would in some way modify our conclusions , we considered a sample of m5 giants drawn from our table  [ m5.tab1 ] , distributed so that rgb , agb and `` tip '' stars are all represented .",

    "the bc s adopted in this case were those of houdashelt .",
    "unfortunately , this procedure proved difficult to apply in practice for two reasons .",
    "first , the expected metallicity of m5 is in the range [ fe / h ] = 1.2 to 1.35 , and the houdashelt  tables contain entries only for [ fe / h ] = 1.0 and 2.0 .",
    "thus one must interpolate within the framework of a rather coarse grid .",
    "second , at a fixed @xmath27 , the relationship between teff and [ fe / h ] is non - linear , so that linear interpolation at the metallicity of m5 is not adequate .",
    "however , these difficulties can be overcome by employing 0  as the independent variable , since  is practically independent of [ fe / h ] at a fixed value of 0 , and depends very little on . to obtain 0  for the stars in our keck sample",
    ", we plotted 0  vs 0  for the 25 stars observed by frogel   ( 1983 ) , and used this plot to transform 0  to 0 , retaining the more recently acquired @xmath9 magnitudes and @xmath27 colors of sandquist ( 1996 ; 2000 , private communication ) .",
    "the color - color plot proved to be extremely tight : we estimate that the transformation could introduce an error of no more than 0.01 mag in 0 .",
    "this procedure permitted us to estimate values of  with little uncertainty due to errors in interpolation .",
    "the difference between  derived from the houdashelt  models and  derived from the alonso  scale is shown as a function of 0  in figure  [ m5.fig5 ] .",

    "normalizing the schnabel  lines to reproduce our adopted solar abundance would negate the offset that the lines would otherwise generate . while an increase in the log  @xmath24-values of by 0.1  dex from those which we have employed in our previous lick - texas work would indeed bring the `` tip''and rgb giant [ fe / h ] values for and into agreement using the alonso   -scale , any change `` across the board '' in @xmath24-values would not simultaneously satisfy the vs offsets for the agb stars .",
    "we summarize the findings of this section by noting that one of three procedural choices can be adopted :    1 .",
    "we adopt the traditional methods of high resolution spectroscopy , including setting the surface gravity from the ionization equilibrium of iron , in which case we find that the mean [ fe / h ] value decreases by 0.15  dex as stellar evolution advances from the rgb to the agb .",
    "we abandon the traditional approach using spectroscopic constraints , basing the analysis instead on values of  derived from the alonso  ( 1999 ) relation between @xmath27 and , which is in turn based on the infra - red flux method ( blackwell   1990 and references therein ) , and values of  derived from application of stellar evolution plus knowledge of the cluster distance modulus .",
    "this approach stabilizes the abundance as a function of evolutionary state but requires acceptance of the idea that is over - ionized and out of equilibrium with , consistent with the non - lte precepts described by thvenin & idiart ( 1999 ) .",
    "the over - ionization of turns out to be more severe among agb as compared with rgb stars .",
    "interestingly , this -scale is in close agreement with the -scale derived from the excitation vs ew plot .",
    "an alternative solution requires arbitrarily increasing the values of  above the alonso  scale by @xmath560k on the rgb and @xmath5120k on the agb ; these changes would bring and abundances nearly into agreement .",
    "the recent models of metal - poor stars by houdashelt  ( 2000 ) , which predict @xmath27 , @xmath40 , and other colors from  and  for different choices of [ fe / h ] , do indeed predict higher values of  than those of the alonso  scale . why the models give a  vs color scale that is hotter than the scale based on the irfm is not clear . the houdashelt   models come close to satisfying ionization constraint requirement among the rgb stars , but are still too cool by @xmath570k to rectify the situation for agb stars . and , if we make the agb stars 120k hotter than the alonso  ( 1999 ) scale , the abundance of will drop to a level about 0.1 dex lower than its value among rgb stars .    here",
    "we adopt procedure ( 2 ) as one extreme , and report the results of procedure ( 1 ) , the opposite extreme , in the appendix .",
    "the reader should bear in mind that the `` intermediate '' solution under ( 3 ) remains an option , but requires a fairly large systematic correction to the irfm - based -scale and a smaller , but still significant , correction to the -scale based on the houdashelt  models .",
    "based on the revised approach , the determination of [ el / fe ] ratios becomes more complex than is the case in the traditional approach .",
    "if fe is over - ionized , then one might expect a corresponding over - ionization of elements having first ionization potentials @xmath41 to that of iron . in the yellow - red spectral regions of globular cluster giants ,",
    "almost all detectable transitions arise from `` metallic elements '' that exist predominantly in singly ionized states .",
    "but aside from fe , which has both neutral and ionized species lines available , only a few elements ( , sc , ba , la , eu , and sometimes ti ) have observable transitions arising from their first ionized states in our stars .",
    "fortunately , the [ el / fe ] ratios of these elements are confidently estimated from their [ el / h ] ratios and [ fe / h ] ratios from . for the majority of elements with only neutral - species lines present ,",
    "estimates must be made of the degree to which the neutral populations are depleted by over - ionization .",
    "oxygen is a special case : it remains overwhelmingly neutral and in the ground state , shielded from over - ionization both by its very high first ionization potential ( 13.6  ev ) and the opacity corresponding to the lyman jump .",
    "there is little doubt that the [ o / fe ] ratio should be based on [ fe / h ] derived from .",
    "the degree of over - ionization of any particular species depends on the ionization potential , the term scheme and the location and strength of the absorption transitions of that atom in relation to the flux distribution of the excess @xmath42 photons .",
    "the excess @xmath42 photons envisaged by ti99 must have a complicated @xmath42 energy distribution reflecting the highly jagged opacity distribution longward of the lyman limit .",
    "calculating the degree of excess ionization is further complicated by the fact that ionizations can take place from excited levels as well as the ground state . to determine accurately the degree of over - ionization of those species which appear in our spectra only in the neutral state would require the calculation of collisional and radiative rates for thousands of levels , as was done in the case of and by ti99 .",
    "such calculations for similar elements are beyond the scope of this paper , although it is obvious that detailed studies need to be carried out .    in the absence of such theoretical calculations , we looked for guidance in the empirical domain , in particular among stars with values of  similar to those of m5 giants , but having higher metallicities so that ews of ionized lines of such species as si , ti , and v are large enough to be measured .",
    "a sample of lmc and smc cepheids ( luck   1998 ) provides [ el / h ] ratios for neutral and ionized states of these three elements both for  based on stellar evolution and for  derived from the versus ionization balance . whenever fe appears to be over - ionized as a result of adopting an `` evolutionary ''",
    ", these authors generally find that si , ti , and v are excessively ionized by essentially the same amount as is fe . in the ionization as a result of abandoning the ionization equilibrium of fe as a means of setting .",
    "thus for example in the case of the smc cepheid hv  837 , luck  find that [ / ] increases from 0.01 to + 0.54 as  changes from 0.28 ( spectroscopic ) to + 0.82 ( evolutionary ) .",
    "the corresponding increases in [ / ] are 0.00 to + 0.55 and for [ / ] are + 0.31 to + 0.84 .",
    "the changes are essentially the same as for fe .",
    "however , we note that when fe is in equilibrium , si is not . ] a similar over - ionization effect is found by kovtykh & andrievsky ( 1999 ) in @xmath19  cep .",
    "if this situation applies also in the m5 giants considered here , then the abundance ratios of [ si / fe ] , [ ti / fe ] , and [ v / fe ] can be estimated from the assumption that the degree of over - ionization of these species is the same as that of fe . in that case these elements must be referenced to the abundance of fe based on . in the absence of detailed calculations",
    "we broaden this procedure to include all elements which present themselves in the neutral state except for oxygen , which for reasons already cited , we reference to fe based on .",
    "we summarize our estimates of the [ el / fe ] ratios for the 19 rgb plus `` tip '' and 6 agb stars in question in table  [ m5.tab5 ] .",
    "columns  3 and 4 contain the values of [ fe / h ] estimated independently for and and column  5 contains [ o / fe ] , assuming that yields the correct abundance of fe . for the remaining elements up through the fe - peak group ( except for sc )",
    ", we list [ el / fe ] on the simple assumption that it is `` correct '' to ratio to . for the heavy elements ( and sc )",
    ", we ratio to .",
    "mean values of [ el / fe ] are found at the bottom of table  [ m5.tab5 ] , individually calculated for rgb and agb stars .",
    "these should be compared with mean values from table  [ m5.tab11 ] in the appendix , which are based on the `` traditional '' method of analysis .",
    "following the arguments of the last two sections we assume that [ el / fe ] ratios are properly deduced by referring neutral species abundances to and ionized species to , the only exception being [ o / fe ] derived from [ ] , which is referred to . following this precept , we add to the 19 rgb and agb giants of table  [ m5.tab5 ] the six stars near the red giant tip and display the resultant [ el / fe ] ratios also in table  [ m5.tab5 ] .",
    "table  [ m5.tab5 ] lists the means of [ fe / h ] derived from and , and the means for the [ el / fe ] ratios based on the above discussion , where we have divided the material into four groups : 13 rgb , 6 agb , 19 rgb plus `` tip '' stars and finally , all 25 stars observed with the keck  i hires . except for the differences in [ fe / h ] derived from versus , there are few surprises .",
    "o , na , and al abundances have a substantial spread of the kind exhibited by most globular clusters ( see the reviews cited in  1 ) , and the @xmath6-elements si , ca , and ti have their usual abundance enhancements of @xmath5 + 0.2 to + 0.35 dex . sc , v , and ni have [ el / fe ] ratios not far from 0.0 , [ mn / fe ]  @xmath3 0.25 as expected ( see , mcwilliam 1997 ) , and the ratio [ ba / eu ]  @xmath3 0.27 is similar to that found in field giants ( shetrone 1996 , mcwilliam 1997 ) and field subdwarfs ( fulbright 2000 , 2001 ) having the metallicity of m5 .    somewhat disconcerting is the slight run of [ ba / eu ] toward larger values in the most advanced evolutionary state  the agb . that this is probably not a manifestation of slow neutron - capture nucleosynthesis occuring within the stars themselves follows from the fact that [ la / eu ] exhibits the opposite behavior .",
    "the slight runs seen here in ba are likely due to the choice of microturbulent velocity : the iron line constraint is satisfied but the same microturbulent velocity may not be appropriate for the atmospheric layers where the ba lines are formed in the lower density agb stars .",
    "the abundances reported by s92-m5 refer to 13 m5 giants observed with the lick hamilton echelle , two of which ( ii-85 and iv-47 ) overlap with the 25 stars observed at keck .",
    "most of these 13 lick stars lie near the rgb tip and therefore provide a valuable supplement to the keck sample .",
    "the earlier analysis employed the `` traditional '' approach ; we consider here a re - analysis of the same data based on our revised approach .",
    "allowances must be made , however , for the lower spectral resolution and more limited free spectral range of the earlier lick observations .",
    "we first re - measured the lick ew s to be sure that continuum levels and line fitting procedures were consistent with the norms established in dealing with the keck i observations .",
    "a plot of original versus re - measured lick ews is shown in figure  [ m5.fig6 ] , from which it is clear that there is no significant difference between them .",
    "we then used the two stars that had been observed both at keck  i and lick to compare the ew scales of their spectrographs . in figure  [ m5.fig7 ]",
    "we plot the difference between the keck  i and ( re - measured ) lick ews as a function of the keck  i ews .",

    "this boxplot illustrates the median , data spread , skew , and distribution of the range of values we derived for each of the elements from our program stars , as well as possible outliers . as can be seen in the figure , the abundance range for elements sensitive to proton - capture nucleosynthesis is large whereas the star - to - star abundance variations for all of the heavier elements is quite small , and consistent with the normal scatter resulting from observational error .",

    "it has an unusually low abundance , a fairly low abundance and by far the largest microturbulent velocity .",
    "the low fe abundances , however , can not alone account for the high [ o / fe ] and [ na / fe ] values , while simultaneously yielding an [ al / fe ] ratio that is too low for its [ o / fe ] .",

    "in response to this inquiry , we explored the distributions of [ o / fe ] and [ na / fe ] when the rgb plus `` tip '' giants are divided into two virtually equal evolutionary groups : 14 giants having  @xmath22 1.02 and 13 having  @xmath1 1.02 .",
    "the results are shown in histogram form in figure  [ m5.fig11 ] .",
    "we performed a mann - whitney u - test ( equivalent to a wilcoxon rank - sum test ) to test the hypothesis that the two samples have the same mean of oxygen abundance ratio distribution against the hypothesis that they differ .",
    "there is a less than 1% probability that the two samples have the same mean of distribution .",
    "thus we confirm statistically what can be discerned by eye : the two samples have significantly different means of distribution .",
    "in contrast with m13 , the distributions above and below evolutionary  of 1.02 are differently skewed , but in a sense opposite to that expected in the evolutionary scenario .",
    "this result , although not incompatible with the primordial scenario , does not rule out the notion that the required evolutionary change could have taken place among giants fainter than those probed by our sample .",
    "measurements of cn band strengths in a substantial number of m5 rgb and agb stars have been carried out by smith & norris ( 1983 , 1993 ) and by briley & smith ( 1993 ) . like many other globular clusters ,",
    "m5 giants present a bimodal distribution of cn band strengths .",
    "smith  ( 1997 ) found that strong cn bands among m5 giants are generally driven by a high abundance of n , and that the index s(3839 ) , which is a measure of the flux in the cn molecular band relative to that in a nearby comparison region , is anti - correlated with [ o / fe ] and correlated with [ na / fe ] .",
    "for a scenario in which the star - to - star abundance variations seen here are a result of proton - capture nucleosynthesis , such a behavior of cn band strengths is expected , since c will likely have been processed to n when o is transmuted to n and ne to na ( langer  1993 , cavallo   1998 ) .",
    "the giants studied here add further weight to this picture . in figure  [ m5.fig12",
    "] , we plot [ na / fe ] and [ o / fe ] as a function of the cn bandstrength index @xmath19s(3839 ) for 30 giants .",
    "the s(3839 ) values were taken from smith & norris ( 1993 ) , supplemented by smith & norris ( 1983 ) , briley & smith ( 1993 ) and smith  ( 1997 ) .",
    "where available , the smith & norris ( 1993 ) values were adopted . in the case of multiple measurements from the other sources ,",
    "an average value was adopted , subsequent to employing the transformations described in smith   ( 1997 ) .",
    "the `` raw '' s(3839 ) values are shown in table  [ m5.tab1 ] . because some of the cn bandstrength measured by s(3839 ) is sensitive to temperature ( given the same c and n abundances , cooler stars have intrinsically larger s(3839 ) indices than their hotter counterparts ) , we `` detrended '' the raw s(3839 ) index .",
    "we fitted a `` baseline '' as a function of  to the s(3839 ) results , and formed a differential cn strength index , @xmath45 we further binned the stars into `` cn - strong '' and `` cn - weak '' groups using smith & norris ( 1993 ) as a guide , with the exception that we designated the smith & norris `` intermediate '' strength stars , and other stars with similar @xmath19s(3839 ) measures , as cn - strong .",
    "we find the @xmath19s(3839 ) index to be correlated with na and anti - correlated with o , as shown in figure  [ m5.fig12 ] .",
    "returning to figure  [ m5.fig9 ] , where we note the stars as being cn - strong ( s ) or cn - weak ( w ) , we see that the cn - strong stars lie in the low o , high na part of the diagram , with cn - weak stars dominating the high o , low na portion .",
    "as seen in previous studies of other globular clusters , the na and o abundance patterns also correlate with the cn strength as inferred by the @xmath19s(3839 ) index .",
    "a few stars plotted in figure  [ m5.fig9 ] remain anomalous ; we have already noted i-20 and iv-59 .",
    "the two stars i-68 and iii-78 appear to be a bit oxygen - rich for their sodium abundances .",
    "ii-85 has high [ o / fe ] but only an intermediate value of @xmath19s(3839 ) .",
    "i-55 has diminished oxygen and enhanced sodium , opposite to what would be expected from its cn bandstrength index . for this star ,",
    "the abundances of the two pairs of na lines have a standard deviation of 0.06  dex and the two oxygen line syntheses are in excellent agreement . however , there is some ambiguity about its cn bandstrength classification : smith & norris ( 1993 ) give a small s(3839 ) value , corresponding to that of a cn - weak star but list i-55 as a cn - strong star .",
    "we suggest that a closer examination of the cn measurements of this particular agb star is required to resolve the ambiguity .",
    "the star iii-96 appears to have an excessive na abundance , but the values of [ na / fe ] derived from the @xmath255682 , 5688    pair and the @xmath256154 , 6161    pair are in poor agreement .",
    "similar correlations between cn - strength and location in the al - na correlation are found in figure  [ m5.fig10 ] , where we find , in general , that the cn - strong stars lie in the high al , high na part of the diagram .",
    "but again there are a few anomalous stars like i-20 and i-55 .",
    "we conclude that , within the errors of our abundance determinations , most m5 giants follow the expected pattern of proton - capture nucleosynthesis with only a few exceptions , but these exceptions are compatible with the existence of primordial abundance variations among at least a few members of m5 .",
    "figure  [ m5.fig12 ] also demonstrates that within both the cn - weak and cn - strong groups there is an intrinisc spread in @xmath19s(3839 ) , [ o / fe ] , and [ na / fe ] .",
    "even the cn - weak stars themselves show an intrinsic dispersion in @xmath19s(3839 ) , [ o / fe ] , and [ na / fe ] . the same is true for the cn - strong stars",
    ". if these observations are not a result of scatter due to observational error , then they are consistent with a `` primordial '' scatter of na and o , produced by proton - capture nucleosynthesis in an earlier generation of stars , which has subsequently been modified by deep mixing in the sample stars themselves .",
    "although many clusters have giants with variations in c , n , o , na , al , and mg that are attributable to the proton - capture process , they also usually yield [ el / fe ] ratios of the fe - peak elements , @xmath6-capture elements such as si , ca , and ti and heavy neutron - capture elements such as ba and eu that are stable and `` normal '' with respect to typical halo field stars . in this respect",
    ", m5 is no exception . in table",
    "[ m5.tab9 ] we list [ el / fe ] ratios for m5 together with the mean of a large sample of halo field subdwarfs at [ fe / h ]  @xmath3 1.2 ( fulbright 2000 , 2001 ) , for most of the elements , supplemented by field giants ( gratton & sneden 1994 ) in the case of la . in the upper part of this table , we consider only those elements not subject to proton - capture nucleosynthesis . among these elements ,",
    "the agreement between m5 and the halo field subdwarfs is good , the difference never exceeding 1-@xmath30 ( for m5 ) . in the lower part of this table",
    "we add rows for [ na / fe ] and [ al / fe ] .",
    "in contrast to cluster stars , field stars do not show evidence for enhanced na and al as a result of proton captures on ne and mg , respectively ( hanson  1998 , kraft 1999 , gratton  2000 ) , so it is not surprising that m5 giants on the average show higher [ na / fe ] and [ al / fe ] values than are found in halo field subdwarfs .",
    "we wish to compare [ el / fe]-ratios in m5 with m4 , a cluster having nearly the same metallicity as m5 . however , the m5 [ el / fe ] ratios listed in table  [ m5.tab9 ] come from the revised method of this paper .",
    "the abundances in m4 had been derived assuming that  could be set from the ionization equilibrium of and .",
    "unfortunately , for the m4 stars we can not set  from the alonso  ( 1999 ) relation between @xmath27 and  plus application of stellar evolution .",
    "m4 is heavily and differentially reddened , and the ratio of total to selective absorption @xmath46  = @xmath47 is not the normal value of 3.2 , but is estimated to lie in the range 3.1 to 4.0 ( dixon & longmore 1993 ; i99-m4 ) .",
    "thus @xmath48 is not accurately known .",
    "to gain an idea of the effect on [ el / fe ] ratios in m4 if we were to adopt the same approach consistent with the non - lte precepts of ti99 , we turn the problem around : we adopt the geometrical distance ( 1.7  kpc ) given by peterson  ( 1995 ) and increase the traditionally derived values of  by an amount that offsets [ fe / h ] from and by the same amount as we have derived for m5 , , 0.09  dex . from table  2 of i99-m4",
    ", we find that the values of  of giants in m4 need to be increased by 0.12  dex . again from table",
    "[ m5.tab3 ] we see that the effect of this increase on [ el / fe]-ratios is actually quite small : for o , na , mg , al , si , ca , sc , ti , la , and eu , the corrections do not exceed 0.02  dex .",
    "the reduction in [ ba / fe ] is a bit larger : 0.04  dex .",
    "these values , therefore slightly revised from those given in table  5 of i99-m4 , are listed in the last column of table  [ m5.tab9 ] .",
    "we conclude that any comparison of [ el / fe ] ratios between these two clusters is nearly independent of the analysis technique .",
    "but two consequences of the revised approach are noteworthy .",
    "first , for m4 , @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1  = 1.17 and 1.08 if derived from and , respectively .",
    "second , for a geometrical distance of 1.7  kpc and the revised values of , we obtain a ratio of total to selective absorption @xmath46  = 3.9 (  3.4 of i99-m4 ) if @xmath49  = 0.37 ( dixon & longmore 1993 ) .    to put the i99-m4 results on the m5 system of analysis used in this study ,",
    "we have applied the @xmath19[el / fe ] corresponding to the 0.12  dex increase in .",
    "most of the mean values of [ el / fe ] listed in table  [ m5.tab9 ] for m4 and m5 are derived from 24 and 35 stars respectively , and therefore the standard deviations are generally quite small . in addition , systematic errors are likely not to be a problem since the methods of analysis are basically the same . among most fe - peak and @xmath6-element abundances ,",
    "the agreement between m4 and m5 is good , generally within 1-@xmath30 .",
    "the main exception seems to be [ si / fe ] : the si abundance in m4 exceeds that of m5 by about 3-@xmath30 .",
    "similar 3-@xmath30 overabundances in m4 compared with m5 ( and the field ) are found in ba and la .",
    "al is also higher in m4 than in m5 ( and the field ) , but the significance of this result is less clear since al is a product of proton - capture nucleosynthesis and known to be highly variable among cluster stars .    based on our large stellar sample and the updated i99-m4 results , we extend the work of i99-m4 and confirm what brown & wallerstein ( 1992 ) found from a small sample of m4 stars : si , al , ba and la abundances are unusually large in m4 .",
    "we confirm also the earlier study of s92-m5 which showed that m5 has `` normal '' abundances . in the comparison of m5 with m4",
    ", we did not find the difference in mg reported by i99-m4 but , in our observations , the lines were recorded in the spectra of only two m5 giants .",
    "the mean abundance for our two stars is 0.39 @xmath29 0.03 ( @xmath30 = 0.07 ) which is comparable to the mean in i99-m4 , 0.42 @xmath29 0.02 ( @xmath30 = 0.08 ) . in the i99-m4 study ,",
    "the difference reported with respect to m5 was determined using the results of shetrone ( 1996 ) . employing",
    "shetrone s published ews and the revised models we have derived in this analysis , we obtain an average [ mg / fe]-ratio of + 0.32 @xmath29 0.03 ( @xmath30 = 0.07 ) for the shetrone data , which , combined with the two stars from our sample , gives an average [ mg / fe]-ratio of 0.34 @xmath29 0.03 ( @xmath30 = 0.07 ) .",
    "we find that the difference in mg between m4 and m5 is a bit more than 1-@xmath30 .    in the following boxplots ,",
    "we show the range of abundances found in both m4 and m5 : figure  [ m5.fig13 ] illustrates the elements which may be sensitive to proton - capture nucleosynthesis , figure  [ m5.fig14 ] shows the heavier @xmath6- and fe - peak elements , and figure  [ m5.fig15 ] illustrates the @xmath7- and @xmath50-process element abundances . in these plots , it is apparent that the al `` floor '' in m4 is elevated , while the range of al abundances is roughly equal to that of m5 ; si is elevated ; and both ba and la are elevated .",
    "the other elements show sufficient overlap to be consistent with showing no significant differences in the abundance ratios .",
    "could the enhanced ba and la abundances in m4 found by brown & wallerstein ( 1992 ) and i99-m4 be simply due to the weighting of the agb stars in their samples ?",
    "first , we point out that not a single star in m5 ( agb , rgb or `` tip '' ) has been found to possess a la abundance that is as large as even the lowest value found in m4 .",
    "next , we note that in the i99-m4 study , the mean ba and la abundances for the agb stars ( as determined using their figure  12 ) are the same as those in the rest of the sample .",
    "since the ba and la enhancements in m4 are not a result of slow neutron - capture synthesis occuring in the stars themselves , they must be signatures of primordial enrichments of the material out of which the m4 stars formed .",
    "in figure  [ m5.fig16 ] , we plot [ na / fe ] versus [ o / fe ] values for m4 and m5 and globular clusters that bracket m4 and m5 in metallicity .",
    "the plot illustrates a difference in abundance patterns that can be divided into two groups .",
    "the o versus na anti - correlation found in m5 resembles that found in the slightly more metal - poor clusters m3 , m10 and m13 ( @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1 1.5 to 1.6 ) .",
    "the pattern is quite different from that found in m4 .",
    "instead , m4 s behavior seems to be much more like that of m71 , a disk cluster of much higher metallicity ( @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1 @xmath5 0.8 ; sneden  1994 ) .",
    "we note that these clusters can also be binned by horizontal branch morphology .",
    "according to the catalog compiled by harris ( 1996 ; june 22 , 1999 revision ) , m3 , m5 , m10 , and m13 all have @xmath51 0 ( where @xmath52 , @xmath9 , and @xmath53 represent the number of stars on the blue end of the hb , in the hertzsprung gap , and on the red end , respectively ) whereas m4 and m71 have @xmath54 0 .",
    "in addition , shetrone & keane ( 2000 ) note that the na - o and al - o anticorrelations between the slightly more metal - poor clusters ngc  288 ( @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1 = 1.39 ) and ngc  362 ( @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1 = 1.33 ) resemble those of m4 ( i99-m4 ) and m5 ( s92-m5 ) , respectively .",
    "the important conclusion established by this investigation is that there is no definitive `` single '' value of [ el / fe ] at a given [ fe / h ] for at least some @xmath6-capture , odd - z , and @xmath7-process elements , in this case , si , al , ba and la . it is therefore not clear that one can claim some `` exact '' value of ( say ) [ si / fe ] that characterizes globular cluster or halo field stars at a given [ fe / h ] .",
    "rather , there is a spread that is certainly real and not a result simply of observational or analytical error .",
    "our result is therefore consistent with an increasingly large body of evidence ( , sneden 2000 ) that in the halo [ el / fe ] ratios are not universal at a given metallicity .",
    "for example , the outer halo clusters rup  106 and pal  12 have very low ( close to solar ) @xmath6-capture element abundances ( brown   1997 ) as do a few subdwarfs having unusually large absolute angular momenta ( carney 1999 , fulbright 2001 , and references therein ) . very high si abundances ( @xmath0[si / fe]@xmath1 @xmath50.6 )",
    "are observed in the very metal - poor ( @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1 @xmath52.4 ) globular cluster m15 ( sneden  1997 ) .",
    "the overabundance of ba in m15 compared with m92 , two clusters of very similar metallicity , is well established ( sneden  2000 ) .",
    "it has also been known for some time that ba and other @xmath7-process species are greatly enhanced in metal - rich giants of @xmath55  cen compared with field halo and globular cluster stars of comparable metallicity ( vanture  1994 ; norris & da costa 1995 ) .",
    "in fact , there exists in @xmath55  cen a stellar sample which possesses nearly identical elemental overabundances of [ si / fe ] , [ al / fe ] , and [ ba / fe ] as seen in m4 .",
    "however , in @xmath55  cen , the sample consists of stars possessing a range of metallicities ( 0.5 @xmath0 [ fe / h ] @xmath0 2.0 ) .",
    "even more striking is the eu deficiency found among @xmath55  cen giants of intermediate metallicity ( smith  2000 ) .",
    "we have analysed the chemical abundances of 36 m5 giant stars by two different techniques .",
    "we employed `` traditional '' spectroscopic analysis procedures , setting  by satisfying the constraint of iron excitation potential equilibrium , setting @xmath28 by satisfying the constraint of iron equivalent width equilibrium , setting  by satisfying the constraint of iron ionization equilibrium , and satisfying the additional constraint that the derived [ fe / h ] does not vary systematically over the range of  and  represented by the cluster program stars . satisfying these constraints led to models whose spectroscopic  values were @xmath50.5  dex lower than expected , which in turn led to @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1 ratios 0.15  dex lower among our agb sample than among our rgb sample .",
    "these outcomes are consistent with known problems that result from applying lte assumptions to non - lte atmospheres .",
    "we investigated a number of alternative approaches to the analysis , seeking to resolve the outcomes without resorting to invoking non - lte effects .",
    "however , regardless of which -scale or -scale we adopted , the [ fe / h ] based on remained significantly smaller on the agb as compared with the rgb and `` tip '' stars .",
    "accordingly , we adopted an analysis consistent with the non - lte precepts as discussed by thvenin & idiart ( 1999 ) , employing `` new '' models with evolutionary values of   on the same system as those of previous m5 work .",
    "these results yielded @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1 = 1.21 ( @xmath30  = 0.06 ) , that were neither dependent on  nor  and are in good agreement with previously derived values for the metallicity of m5 in the literature ( , @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1  = 1.4 , zinn & west 1984 ; @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1  = 1.17 , sneden   1992 ) .",
    "applying the same procedures to the m4 results of ivans  ( 1999 ) , we re - determine the metallicity of m4 to be @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1 = 1.08 ( @xmath30 = 0.02 ) .",
    "the remaining abundances in m4 are offset by an amount equivalent to an increase in  of 0.12  dex ( see table  2 of ivans  1999 ) . applying this increase in  to the m4 stars",
    ", we derive the ratio of total to selective absorption @xmath46  = 3.9 ( see  3.4 of ivans  1999 ) .    with the revised method of analysis",
    ", we find good agreement between m5 and m4 ( and the field ) in most of the fe - peak and @xmath6-element abundances .",
    "the exception is silicon .",
    "the [ si / fe ] abundance in m4 exceeds that of m5 by @xmath53-@xmath30 .",
    "ba and la are similarly overabundant in m4 with respect to m5 ( and the field ) , as is aluminum .",
    "however , since al is sensitive to proton - capture nucleosynthesis , the range of aluminum abundances in both clusters mask the overall difference in the `` floor '' abundances . based on these large stellar samples",
    ", we confirm and extend the previous findings for both of these clusters : si , al , ba , and la are enhanced in m4 , whereas m5 has `` normal '' abundances .    in m5 , we find the classic anti - correlation of o and na abundances , and correlated al and na abundances . and , the behavior of these abundances is further correlated with the cn strength index , @xmath19s(3839 ) : stars with larger cn indices also have larger al abundances , larger na abundances and lower o abundances than stars with lower cn indices .",
    "this behavior is consistent with that seen in previous studies of other globular clusters and follows the expected pattern of proton - capture nucleosynthesis ( , low oxygen abundances are usually accompanied by low carbon and enhanced nitrogen abundances .",
    "thus , stronger cn bands , reflecting higher n abundances , belong to stars that are more highly cno - processed ) .",
    "we binned the m5 rgb and `` tip '' giants into two evolutionary groups by , and find that the o and na abundances are different for the two groups : the stars with lower  have higher o and lower na abundances on average than the stars with higher values of .",
    "thus , in m5 , the dependence of the abundance variations on  is in the _ opposite _ sense to that found in m13 by kraft  ( 1997 ) , where the relationship provided strong evidence in support of the evolutionary scenario .",
    "the present analysis of m5 giants does not necessarily rule out the evolutionary scenario , but it neither provides support for it nor is it incompatible with the primordial scenario .",
    "in fact , both may be at work .",
    "our observations of the spread in [ o / fe ] , [ na / fe ] , and [ al / fe ] ratios in both the cn - strong and cn - weak groups are consistent with the idea that an earlier generation of stars may have enriched some of the material out of which the current sample formed then , once on the rgb , the stars were subject to deep mixing , further altering the abundances .",
    "thus , deep mixing on the rgb would explain the spreads within the cn - strong and cn - weak groups , and primordial enrichment the difference between the two groups .    in comparison with clusters that bracket m4 and m5 in metallicity",
    ", we find that the abundance patterns can be divided into two groups : the o vs na anti - correlation found in m5 resembles the pattern seen in slightly more metal - poor globular clusters m3 , m10 , and m13 ( @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1 = 1.5 to 1.6 ) whereas the anti - correlation found in m4 resembles that of the more metal - rich disk cluster m71 ( @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1 @xmath5 0.7 ) .",
    "these similarities extend to the hb morphology of the clusters : according to the catalog compiled by harris ( 1996 ) , m3 , m5 , m10 , and m13 all have @xmath51 0 ( where @xmath52 , @xmath9 , and @xmath53 represent the number of stars on the blue end of the hb , in the hertzsprung gap , and on the red end , respectively ) whereas m4 and m71 have @xmath54 0 .",

    "our result is therefore consistent with an increasingly large body of evidence ( , sneden 2000 ) that in the halo [ el / fe ] ratios are not universal at a given metallicity .",

    "<S> we present a chemical composition analysis of 36 giant stars in the mildly metal - poor ( @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1 = 1.21 ) globular cluster m5 ( ngc  5904 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis makes use of high resolution data acquired for 25 stars at the keck  i telescope , as well as a re - analysis of the high resolution spectra for 13 stars acquired for an earlier study at lick observatory . </S>",
    "<S> we employed two analysis techniques : one , adopting standard spectroscopic constraints , including setting the surface gravity from the ionization equilibrium of iron , and two , subsequent to investigating alternative approaches , adopting an analysis consistent with the non - lte precepts as recently described by thvenin & idiart . </S>",
    "<S> the abundance ratios we derive for magnesium , silicon , calcium , scandium , titanium , vanadium , nickel , barium and europium in m5 show no significant abundance variations and the ratios are comparable to those of halo field stars . however , large variations are seen in the abundances of oxygen , sodium and aluminum , the elements that are sensitive to proton - capture nucleosynthesis . </S>",
    "<S> these variations are well - correlated with the cn bandstrength index s(3839 ) . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , in m5 the dependence of the abundance variations on  is in the opposite sense to that discovered in m13 by the lick - texas group where the relationship provided strong evidence in support of the evolutionary scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the present analysis of m5 giants does not necessarily rule out an evolutionary scenario , but it provides no support for it either . in comparing the abundances of m5 and m4 ( ngc  6121 ) , another mildly metal - poor ( @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1 = 1.08 ) globular cluster , we find that silicon , aluminum , barium and lanthanum are overabundant in m4 with respect to what is seen in m5 , confirming and expanding the results of previous studies . in comparing the abundances between these two clusters and others having comparable metallicities , we find that the anti - correlations observed in m5 are similar to those found in more metal - poor clusters , m3 , m10 and m13 ( @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1 = 1.5 to 1.6 ) , whereas the behavior in m4 is more like that of the more metal - rich globular cluster m71 ( @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath2 0.8 ) . we conclude that among stars in galactic globular clusters , there is no definitive `` single '' value of [ el / fe ] at a given [ fe / h ] for at least some alpha - capture , odd - z and slow neutron - capture process elements , in this case , silicon , aluminum , barium and lanthanum .    </S>",
