    "both theoretical and experimental investigations of the optical properties of composite materials have been of basic importance over the years @xcite . in particular , effective medium theories , in which the electromagnetic response of the composite is described in terms of an effective dielectric function @xmath1 , have been a useful tool for the interpretation of absorption spectra@xcite .",
    "mean - field theories of the effective response function have also been proved to be useful to analyze electron energy - loss experiments in which swift electrons penetrate composites at random distances from the particles@xcite@xmath2@xcite .    in the long - wavelength limit , the effective transverse dielectric function for a system of spherical particles was first derived by maxwell - garnett ( mg)@xcite , within a mean - field approximation valid for small values of the volume occupied by the spheres .",
    "a generalization of the mg theory to finite wavelength , taking account of the spatial nonlocality in the response , has been recently presented by barrera and fuchs@xcite . on the other hand , many attempts have been made to account , at large filling fractions , for higher multipole interactions , which are absent in the mg theory@xcite@xmath2@xcite .",
    "recently , exact numerical calculations for periodic dielectric structures have been performed@xcite , based in the long - wavelength limit of photonic band structure calculations , and the mg theory has been shown to offer a good approximation in the low - filling - ratio regime . finally , the discovery of tubular fullerenes@xcite , a few years ago , has opened a new focus of interest for the application of these theories to the case of cylindrical interfaces@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we evaluate , on the basis of photonic band structure calculations , the long - wavelength limit of the effective transverse dielectric function of a composite made up of long metallic cylinders embedded in an otherwise homogeneous medium .",
    "we first demonstrate that the composite can be replaced by an effective homogeneous medium , and then we determine the transverse dielectric function of that medium from the electromagnetic modes supported by such a homogeneous system .",
    "we consider a spectral representation of the effective dielectric function , we present an evaluation of the parameters involved , and we discuss the range of validity of a mg - like approach appropriate for cylindrical particles .",
    "we also address the impact of our results on absorption spectra and electron energy - loss phenomena .",
    "it was shown by bergman@xcite and milton@xcite that in the long - wavelength limit the effective dielectric function of any macroscopically homogeneous two - component system of dielectric constants @xmath3 and @xmath4 and volume fractions @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , can be expressed as a sum of simple poles which depend only on the microgeometry of the composite material and not on the dielectric functions of the components : @xmath7,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the spectral variable @xmath9^{-1},\\ ] ] @xmath10 are depolarization factors , and @xmath11 are the strengths of the corresponding normal modes , which all add up to unity : @xmath12    similarly@xcite , @xmath13\\ ] ] and @xmath14 in particular , if there is only one mode with a strength different from zero , one finds : @xmath15\\ ] ] and @xmath16.\\ ] ]    we consider a binary composite with a volume fraction @xmath6 of insulator , with real dielectric constant @xmath4 , and @xmath5 of a periodic system of long metallic cylinders of diameter @xmath17 arranged in a square array with lattice constant @xmath18 ( see fig .",
    "the diameter of the cylinders is taken to be small in comparison with the wavelength of the electromagnetic excitation and large enough that a macroscopic dielectric function @xmath19 is ascribable to the cylinders .",
    "for simplicity , the magnetic permeabilities are assumed to be equal to unity in both media .",
    "now we take an electromagnetic ( em ) wave normally incident on the structure , so that @xmath20 . for this propagation direction",
    "there are two different values of @xmath21 corresponding to different polarizations . in the case of em",
    "waves polarized along the cylinders ( @xmath22 polarization ) , the presence of the interfaces does not modify the electric field , and one easily finds@xcite that the response of the composite is equivalent to that of a homogeneous medium having the effective transverse dielectric function of eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    for em waves polarized normal to the cylinders ( @xmath25 polarization )",
    ", we first consider the case of a single cylinder embedded in an otherwise homogeneous medium .",
    "an elementary analysis of this classical problem shows that the electric field in the interior of the cylinder is@xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 represents the electric field intensity in the medium outside the cylinder . the effective dielectric function of isolated cylinders",
    "is then found to be given , again , by eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , the depolarization factors now being @xmath28 . in the case of isolated particles",
    "only the dipole surface mode enters eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 4 ) for this polarization .",
    "the interaction between the particles in a composite has been considered , over the years , within the well - known mg approximation .",
    "the basic assumption of this approach is that the average electric field within a particle located in a system of identical particles is related to the average field in the medium outside as in the case of a single isolated particle , thus only dipole interactions being taken into account .",
    "hence , after replacing , for @xmath25 polarization , @xmath27 of eq .",
    "( 8) by @xmath29 @xmath30 being the macroscopic effective electric field in the composite , the mg result for cylindrical inclusions is found , which can be represented by the use of eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) with @xmath31 and @xmath32 this is a special case of the generalized mg dielectric function derived in ref . for ellipsoidal inclusions , which in the case of aligned spheroids distributed at random has been extended beyond the mg approximation@xcite .",
    "higher multipole interactions are neglected in these approaches .    in order to compute , with full inclusion of higher multipoles , the effective dielectric function of our periodic system ,",
    "we first follow ref . to calculate the photonic band structure .",
    "we fix the frequency , the local dielectric function inside the cylinders being therefore specified , and we discretize the maxwell equations within the unit cell .",
    "the discretized maxwell equations provide a relationship between the electromagnetic fields on either side of the unit cell , i.e. , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , and we exploit this to calculate , on applying bloch s theorem , the eigenvalues of the so - called transfer matrix , which will give the band structure of the system .",
    "homogeneous media are well known to support only two transverse modes . on the other hand ,",
    "looking at the imaginary part of the eigenvalues of the system , we observe that over the entire range of frequencies there are , for each polarization , two degenerate em bloch waves with vectors @xmath35 and @xmath36 for which @xmath37 roughly follows the dispersion relation of free light and which are dominant in the sense that they present the smallest attenuation ( smallest imaginary part of @xmath35 ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the composite can be replaced by an effective homogeneous medium , and we use the dispersion relation of these bloch waves to compute the effective transverse dielectric function from @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the speed of light .",
    "we have taken the insulating component of the composite to have a real dielectric constant of @xmath40 , and we have modeled the dielectric properties of the metal inside the cylinders by a simple free - electron ( drude ) dielectric function : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the bulk plasma frequency of the metal , and @xmath43 represents an inverse electron relaxation time .",
    "we have used the plasma frequency of the conduction electrons in aluminum , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .    for @xmath22 polarized electromagnetic waves , our numerical results for the effective dielectric function , as obtained from eq .",
    "( 12 ) , accurately reproduce the exact results of eq .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) with @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and this represents , therefore , a good check of our scheme .    in the case of @xmath25 polarized electromagnetic excitations , great care was exercised to ensure that our calculations are insensitive to the precise value of the number of mesh points in the unit cell@xcite .",
    "the results presented below have been found to be well - converged for all filling fractions , and they all correspond to a sampling mesh of @xmath48@xcite .",
    "the optical absorption is directly given by the imaginary part of the effective dielectric function , @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "thus , for @xmath25 polarization the absorption spectra of isolated cylinders ( @xmath50 ) exhibit a strong maximum , absent in the bulk metal , at the cylinder dipole resonance ( @xmath51 ) , i.e. , at @xmath52 with @xmath53 . at higher concentrations of metal ,",
    "@xmath54 $ ] still shows a dipole resonance at @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , and a band of multipole resonances at @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ; @xmath59 ) is also formed broadened by electromagnetic interactions among individual cylinders .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 , where our first principles calculations of @xmath54/f$ ] are exhibited , as a function of the frequency @xmath60 , for various values of the ratio @xmath61 between the lattice constant and the diameter of the cylinders . for @xmath62 the effective dielectric function is well described by the mg approximation , and both our computed result and the mg approximation almost coincide for @xmath63 with the isolated cylinder result , represented in fig . 2 by a thin solid line .",
    "3 our results are compared , for two different filling fractions , with the mg approximation , showing that together with the appearance of multipole resonances the depolarization factors @xmath64 are , for @xmath65 , smaller than the mg depolarization factor of eq .",
    "( 10 ) .    in the case of a broad beam of charged particles penetrating the composite , the probability per unit path length , per unit energy , for the projectile to transfer energy @xmath66 to the medium is@xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68,\\ ] ] @xmath69 and @xmath70 being the velocity of the incident particles and the effective inverse longitudinal dielectric function of the composite , respectively .",
    "@xmath71 represents the component of the momentum transfer , @xmath72 , located in a plane perpendicular to the incident beam direction , @xmath73 is determined by @xmath74 , @xmath75 representing the largest wave vector for which plasmons are well - defined excitations@xcite , and @xmath76    in typical electron energy - loss experiments swift electrons of about @xmath77 penetrate the composite , and the main contribution to the integral of eq .",
    "( 15 ) comes , therefore , from very small values of the momentum transfer .",
    "also , for small values of the adimensional parameter @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) , @xmath80 being the radius of the cylinder , the effective dielectric function of isolated cylinders has been proved to be rather insensitive to the introduction of a finite wave vector@xcite , and the energy - loss spectra of swift electrons is therefore expected to be , for small values of the radius of the cylinders ( @xmath81)@xcite , well described by the @xmath82 limit of the imaginary part of the effective inverse dielectric function@xcite .",
    "( 7 ) with @xmath83 ( dilute limit of @xmath47 ) and @xmath84 exactly coincides , in the long - wavelength limit , with the result one obtains for the effective inverse longitudinal dielectric function of isolated cylinders when the momentum transfer is parallel to the axis and when it is located in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder , respectively@xcite . in this limit ( @xmath82 ) bulk plasmons are not excited , as a consequence of the so - called bregenzung effect , and the pole in eq .",
    "( 7 ) at @xmath51 , i.e. , @xmath52 with @xmath53 , determines , for @xmath25 polarization , the frequency of the so - called surface plasmon resonance at which electron energy - loss occurs .",
    "4 shows , as a function of the frequency , our calculations of @xmath85/f$ ] obtained for various filling fractions by varying the ratio @xmath61 between the lattice constant and the diameter of the cylinders . in a homogeneous metal the so - called energy - loss function , @xmath85 $ ] , shows a single peak at the bulk plasmon resonance , and this peak persists in the composite for @xmath86 , i.e. , for filling fractions of metal for which the insulator no longer forms a connected medium .",
    "besides this peak , there is also a band in @xmath85 $ ] from multipole contributions to the effective response at @xmath87 ( @xmath58 ; @xmath88 ) . as in the case of @xmath89 $ ] ,",
    "the energy - loss function is well described by the mg approximation in the low - filling - ratio regime , and our results begin to deviate from those obtained within the mg approximation at @xmath90 ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "we also find that the depolarization factors @xmath91 are larger than the mg depolarization factor of eq .",
    "( 11 ) for all volume fractions of metal for which the mg theory does not reproduce our results .    our numerical calculations of the effective dielectric function , as obtained from eq .",
    "( 12 ) , lead us to the conclusion that the depolarization factors @xmath92 and @xmath93 of eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 4 ) , corresponding to dipolar modes , satisfy the following relation : @xmath94 where @xmath95 represents the dimensionality of the inclusions , i.e. , @xmath96 in the case of spherical inclusions and @xmath97 in the case of long circular cylinders . if all multipolar modes are neglected , then @xmath98 in eqs . ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) and a combination of these equations with eq .",
    "( 17 ) results , for @xmath97 , in the spectral representations of eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) with the depolarization factors @xmath92 and @xmath93 given by eqs .",
    "( 10 ) and ( 11 ) , i.e. , the mg approximation .",
    "on the other hand , as long as multipolar modes give non - negligible contributions to the spectral representation of the effective response , i.e. , @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( @xmath58 ) , the strengths of the dipolar modes , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , become smaller than unity ( see eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 5 ) ) , and a combination of eqs . ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) with eq . (",
    "17 ) leads us to the conclusion that the depolarization factors @xmath93 and @xmath92 necessarily deviate from their mg counterparts . that a non - vanishing contribution from multipolar modes appears together with a deviation of the dipolar mode locations with respect to their mg counterparts",
    "is apparent from figs . 3 and 5 .",
    "one of the main advantages of the spectral representation of eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 4 ) is that the depolarization factors and the strengths of the corresponding normal modes depend only on the microgeometry of the composite material and not on the dielectric function of the components . on the other hand , the normal mode positions are determined by @xmath10 and @xmath103 , and we have thus represented in fig .",
    "6 , in the case of @xmath25 polarization , universal curves for the actual dipolar mode depolarization factors and strengths versus the filling fraction .",
    "it is obvious from this figure that the trend with increasing filling fraction is for the dipolar peaks in @xmath89 $ ] / @xmath104 $ ] to move from the cylinder dipole mode ( @xmath28 ) to lower / higher energies .",
    "notice that the mg results , also plotted in this figure , agree with our numerical results for @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "nevertheless , at higher filling fractions the actual depolarization factors approach more rapidly , as @xmath5 is increased , the depolarization factors appropriate to the homogeneous metal ( @xmath23 and @xmath107 ) . in particular , for @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) @xmath107 , indicating that losses due to the bulk plasmon are expected when the metal forms a connected medium .",
    "associated to the deviation of the actual dipolar mode positions from the mg results is the appearance of non - negligible multipolar mode strengths , @xmath11 ( @xmath58 ) and @xmath110 ( @xmath58 ) , and , accordingly ( see eqs . (",
    "3 ) and ( 5 ) ) , a reduction in the dipolar mode strengths @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "these mode strengths determine the dipolar peak heights in @xmath89 $ ] and @xmath111 $ ] , represented in the inset of fig .",
    "6 as a function of @xmath5 . for @xmath98 ,",
    "all multipolar mode strengths being neglected , the dipolar peak heights in @xmath89 $ ] and @xmath111 $ ] are found to be @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively , where @xmath114 represents the peak height in the bulk energy - loss function ( in the case of the drude dielectric function of eq .",
    "( 13 ) , @xmath115 ) .",
    "the actual dipolar peak heights divided by @xmath116 are represented by stars and dots , together with the @xmath98 approximation , i.e. , @xmath117 and @xmath118 , showing , therefore , the magnitude of the actual dipolar mode strengths involved in the spectral representations of eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 4 ) .    in summary ,",
    "we have evaluated , on the basis of photonic band structure calculations , the effective long - wavelength dielectric response function of a system of long metallic cylinders .",
    "we have considered a spectral representation of both direct and inverse effective dielectric functions , of interest in the interpretation of absorption spectra and electron energy - loss experiments , respectively .",
    "we have analyzed the surface mode strengths and positions , and the effect of the electromagnetic interactions between the cylinders has been investigated . we have concluded that mg results are good as long as the distance between the axis of neighbouring cylinders is larger than twice the diameter of the cylinders .",
    "this is in contrast with the results we have also obtained for long dielectric cylinders . in this case",
    "we have found the mg results to be good for almost all the filling ratios for which the cylinders are not touching , as happens in the case of a periodic array of dielectric spheres@xcite .",
