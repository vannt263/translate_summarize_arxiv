    "electron quantum optics @xcite offers the unique possibility to apply long standing concepts and ideas developed in the framework of quantum optics , to individual electronic wave - packets propagating in condensed matter systems .",
    "seminal experiments such as the hanbury - brown - twiss ( hbt ) @xcite and the hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) @xcite interferometers have been performed with periodic trains of electrons and holes produced by means of single electron sources based on driven mesoscopic capacitors @xcite or properly designed lorentzian voltage pulses.@xcite these excitations interfere at the electronic equivalent of a half - silvered mirror  a quantum point contact ( qpc )  and the outgoing current and noise signals are measured",
    ". @xcite the obvious differences between electrons and photons related to the pauli principle,@xcite the presence of the fermi sea,@xcite and the mutual interaction between the electrons @xcite have to be properly taken into account in order to correctly interpret the experimental observations .    until now",
    ", experiments have been carried out in two dimensional electron gas either in absence of magnetic field @xcite or by exploiting the ballistic propagation and chirality of integer quantum hall edge channels.@xcite proposals for electron quantum optics experiments have been presented to extend these ideas also to other topological states of matter like two @xcite and three @xcite dimensional topological insulators , where new interesting features appear as a consequence of helicity and spin - momentum locking.@xcite while experimental / theoretical efforts promise future realizations of such quantum optics scenarios in these newly discovered states of matter , more `` conventional '' condensed matter systems involving superconducting ( sc ) elements ought to be revisited in view of electron quantum optics applications .",
    "this is the goal of the present work .",
    "coupled with a sc contact of length @xmath0 . ]    indeed , in a seminal work @xcite a setup in the integer quantum hall regime was proposed , where continuous flows of electrons are injected in the proximity of sc contacts of finite length before reaching a qpc .",
    "andreev reflection@xcite by the contacts converts electrons into bogoliubov quasiparticles , namely coherent superpositions of electrons and holes with opposite or equal spin depending on the singlet or triplet nature of the sc coupling .",
    "@xcite the outgoing cross - correlated current fluctuations are measured at finite frequency and show a remarkable non - local dependence on the difference in the superconducting phases between two sc contacts as a consequence of the collision of bogoliubov quasiparticles . as argued in refs .",
    ", the fact that bogoliubov quasiparticle creation operators are related by a unitary transformation to their annihilation counterpart justifies their qualification as majorana fermions .",
    "this constitutes an interesting alternative proposal for majorana fermion@xcite detection compared to those put forward in topological superconductor devices , which are mainly focused on the investigation of majorana zero energy modes .",
    "@xcite in ref .",
    ", the annihilation property of bogoliubov quasiparticle beams at a qpc showed a periodic dependence on the phase difference between the two superconductors : a clear manifestation of a non - local interference effect .",
    "yet this work focused on electron `` beams '' in the vicinity of sc , and therefore fails to address the single shot creation and collision of two bogoliubov quasiparticles . in this paper",
    "we investigate an analogous setup where voltage electrodes are replaced by single electron sources ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this allows us to analyze the properties of bogoliubov excitations at the _ single quasiparticle level _ , shading light on various aspects which are not explicitly discussed in ref . .",
    "one of the experimental challenges implied by the diagnosis of ref .",
    "is the fact that collisions between majorana fermions need to be detected through high frequency noise measurements , which currently require an on - chip quantum device@xcite attached to the sample .",
    "unfortunately , the measurement of the high frequency noise characteristics of a normal metal - superconductor junction as needed here , and which was computed more than a decade ago in ref .",
    ", has so far eluded experimental realization . on the contrary , with single particle / quasiparticle injection , the requirement for measuring high frequency noise",
    "is lifted : zero frequency noise measurements are sufficient to probe physically relevant effects , and they have been already successfully implemented with single electron sources recently.@xcite    our first aim is to provide information about the nature of the excitations reaching the qpc .",
    "we will first characterize the injection process in terms of current and noise , focusing on the role played by the non - conservation of the charge and the conservation of the excitation number which identify the sc .",
    "we then move to interferometric configurations with a qpc . in the hbt case",
    "only one of the sources of bogoliubov excitations is on and measurements return the partition noise associated with the injected quasiparticles , while in the hom case both sources are on and measurements can access the intimate structure of these peculiar quasiparticles .",
    "this is particularly evident when one of the sources injects a reference state , namely an electron , while the other emits a more general bogoliubov excitation . in this case",
    "the setup can be used to carry out a true spectroscopy of the unknown incoming state , the sign of the outgoing noise depending on the relative weight of the electron and hole component of the superposition .",
    "quite remarkable in this context is the case of a zero charge bogoliubov excitation . here",
    "the outgoing current as well as the hbt noise contribution are zero , but the hom noise is maximal as a consequence of the non - trivial structure of the quasiparticle . finally , it is worth noticing that the considered setup shows no dependence on the sc phase at the level of the averaged current ( first order coherence ) , while oscillations dependent on the sc phase difference appears in the noise ( second order coherence ) .",
    "the paper is divided as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we recover the results of ref . about the action , in terms of a transfer matrix , of a sc contact on an incoming electronic wave - packet originating from an integer quantum hall system at filling factor @xmath1 , where spin singlet sc coupling is expected .",
    "section [ current ] discusses the current and the excitation density outgoing from the sc contact with particular attention to the role played by the non - conservation of the charge and the conservation of the excitation number associated with the bogoliubov - de gennes hamiltonian describing the system .",
    "the fluctuations of the current outgoing from the contact are also investigated in comparison with the results obtained for the conventional single electron source . in section [ noise ]",
    "we investigate the cross - correlation noise outgoing from the qpc , described in terms of a scattering matrix .",
    "in particular we consider the hbt contribution ( [ section_hbt ] ) where only one source is on .",
    "next , we deal with the hom noise ( [ section_hom ] ) obtained when the two sources are on . the limitations occurring in extending the same analysis for an integer quantum hall state at @xmath2 with triplet sc coupling are discussed in section [ triplet ] .",
    "the appendix contains analytical evaluations of the most relevant quantities .",
    "let us start by discussing the case of two quantum hall edge channels unresolved in spin , namely the boundary of a hall bar at filling factor @xmath1 , in which we neglect the zeeman splitting and the inter - channel interaction .",
    "@xcite these edge states are coupled to a single electron source ( ses ) and to a sc contact of length @xmath0 ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the ses injects into the channels an electron ( hole ) with well defined wave - packets which can have exponential @xcite or lorentzian @xcite profile in time , depending on the considered experimental set - up . in the following we attempt to remain as general as possible in order to derive expressions which are valid for all the physically relevant cases . as shown in ref .",
    "a spin - singlet coupling between the hall channel and the sc contact can be realized in graphene and is favored by the small spin - orbit coupling associated with this material.@xcite    the action of the sc on incoming electrons with energy below the induced sc gap @xmath3 can be described in terms of an energy dependent @xmath4 transfer matrix @xmath5 , constrained by unitarity and particle - hole symmetry:@xcite    ( ) = ( _ xi ) ^*(- ) ( _ xi ) .",
    "[ particle_hole ] in the above expression @xmath6 is the identity in spin space , while from now on we indicate with @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) the pauli matrices acting on the electron - hole space and with @xmath9 ( @xmath8 ) the ones related to the spin degree of freedom .",
    "according to this , the transfer matrix @xmath5 is applied to a @xmath10-component spinor state : @xcite    c()= (    c_e , ( ) + c_e , ( ) + c_h , ( ) + c_h , ( ) +    ) , [ spinor ] where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) indicates the electron ( hole ) state and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) the up ( down ) spin direction . the particle - hole symmetry in eq .",

    "one finds that , in order not to destroy the sc , the condition @xmath26 , and consequently @xmath27 , is required in this case .",

    "the outgoing electronic current of eq .",
    "( [ current ] ) differs from the incoming one @xcite @xmath44 , by a time delay @xmath45 and by a factor @xmath46 , which takes into account the effect of the sc region when converting electrons into holes through andreev reflections .",
    "this factor is simply given by the difference between the probability @xmath47 for the incoming electron to emerge as an electron and @xmath48 to be converted into a hole .",
    "for @xmath49 ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) the sc contact only induces a delay , while for @xmath52 ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) the incoming electron is completely converted into a hole and a cooper pair enters into the sc .",
    "more importantly , for @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) the electron and hole contributions compensate and no averaged current flows out of the device . as will be clear in the following this zero averaged current still shows fluctuations which can be detected via noise measurements .    according to the above discussion the charge outgoing from the sc contact :    = ^+_- dt |i(t ) |= -e ( 2 ) [ charge ]",
    "is not conserved as a consequence of the creation / destruction of cooper pairs in the sc .",
    "conversely , according to the unitarity of the scattering matrix , the outgoing excitation density is given by : |(t ) |= ( t- ) ^*(t- ) = |_in(t- ) | , + which implies a mere time delay @xmath45 with respect to the incoming one . in this case",
    "the prefactor is given by @xmath57 as a consequence of the fact that the incoming electron can only emerge from the device as an electron or as a hole and can not be absorbed by the sc .",
    "this illustrates the conservation of the number of injected excitations : = ^+_- d t |(t ) |=^+_- dt    charge and the conservation of the excitation number are encoded in the bogoliubov - de gennes hamiltonian which is at the origin of the transfer matrix of eq .",
    "( [ transfer ] ) ( see ref . ) .",
    "proceeding along the same way , we consider the current fluctuations at the output of the sc contact . in the zero frequency limit",
    "they are given by : @xcite s_source&=&^+_- dt dt + & = & e^2 \\{1- ^2 } + & = & e^2 ^ 2(2 ) [ noise_out ] where @xmath58 is the connected two point correlator of generic operators @xmath59 and @xmath22 .    it is worth noticing that the above quantity is proportional to the product @xmath60 .",
    "therefore it is zero in absence of a sc contact ( @xmath49 ) , as expected , @xcite and also for @xmath52 when the incoming electron is completely converted into a hole .",
    "even more interestingly is the fact that it reaches its maximum for @xmath55 , when the outgoing averaged current is zero due to the action of the sc contact .",
    "once the device is characterized as an emitter of individual bogoliubov quasiparticles we need to investigate the outgoing cross - correlated noise in a qpc geometry where one or two ses ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) inject electronic wave - packets with spin up in the vicinity of one or two sc regions ( see fig .",

    "the scattering matrix associated with the qpc reads : @xcite = (    & - + & +    ) [ sigma_matrix ] where @xmath71 is the probability of reflection .",
    "consequently the annihilation spinors outgoing from the qpc are related to the ones emitted by the two ses through the equations : a_1&= & _ 1c_1 - _ 2 c_2 , + a_2&= & _ 1c_1 + _ 2 c_2 , where the energy dependence has been omitted for notational convenience .",

    "this will lead to important simplification in the following when discussing the hbt and the hom interferometers in detail .",

    "we observe that the presented device shows no dependence on the sc phase at the level of the averaged current ( first order coherence ) , but presents an oscillatory modulation in the noise ( second order coherence ) .",
    "this purely second order correlation effect is in analogy to what is observed in interferometric geometries discussed in the framework of the quantum hall effect like the samuelsson - sukhorukov - bttiker interferometer @xcite or the revisitation of the franson interferometer @xcite proposed by splettstoesser _",

    "the controlled emission of bogoliubov excitations can be used to realize electron quantum optics experiments such as hbt and hom interferometry . in the former ( hbt )",
    "case we obtain the shot noise associated with the ( non - integer ) charge of the bogoliubov excitation .",
    "it vanishes when the electron component of this object corresponds to its hole counterpart . in the latter ( hom ) it is possible to investigate two particle interference properties of these peculiar excitations showing that quasiparticles bearing zero charge and thus zero partition noise have maximal hom contribution as a consequence of interference between the electron / electron and hole / hole amplitudes",
    "this is explicit in our zero time delay predictions .",
    "we finally proposed a source injecting purely electronic wave - packets as a way to realize the hom spectroscopy of the bogoliubov excitations .",
    "plots of the hom noise revealed that this quantity can either be positive or negative depending on the weight of the electron or hole component of the bogoliubov quasiparticle .",
    "this result has no equivalent in current electron optics experiments .    for completeness",
    ", we also considered the triplet pairing case for a single edge state , where our formalism can be translated straighforwardely from the @xmath1 case .",
    "however , our estimates for experimental investigations in this former case suggest that the mixing angle is confined to low values , which does not constitute an optimal setup for the observation of non local interference phenomena of single bogoliubov quasiparticles .",
    "our analysis clearly showed that the singlet - spin coupling at filling factor @xmath1 is more suitable for that respect .",
    "extensions of this work could include the discussion of finite temperature effects , as can be readily achieved in scattering matrix approaches to electronic quantum optics calculations.@xcite more demanding would be to include the effect of coulomb interaction between edges , as the phenomenon of electron fractionalization which is known to occur at @xmath1 in the absence of superconductivity , and which gives rise to a charged and a neutral mode , would modify the nature of bogoliubov quasiparticles .    concerning the experimental feasibility , we point out that on demand electron sources are currently available,@xcite and that the conditions for placing a superconductor in contact to quantum hall edge channels have been discussed previously.@xcite single particle sources typically operate with periodic trains of electrons and holes , implying many collisions between the injected objects , which allow for data acquisition , because a single shot experiment with two particles ( quasiparticles ) can not be achieved so far .",
    "in addition to the spectroscopy experiment proposed in this work with electrons and bogoliubov quasiparticles , we can envision collisions between holes and bogoliubov quasiparticles , which constitutes a straightforward extention of our present results .",
    "an important experimental advantage with the present single particle sources proposal is that it allows to probe the description of the annihilation of bogoliubov particle ( thus majorana fermions ) at the single excitation level , and this protocol calls `` only '' for zero frequency noise measurements , as opposed to the biased voltage/``quasiparticle beam '' experiments suggested in ref . .",
    "thus the experiments proposed here do no require an on - chip noise measurement circuit in order to achieve the diagnosis of non local interference and ( in particular ) the annihilation of single bogoliubov quasiparticles .",

    "in this appendix we evaluate explicitly the main quantities needed in order to fully characterize the behavior of the source described in fig . [ fig1 ] .",
    "as achieved in the main text we consider the injection of a purely electronic wave - packet by the ses .",

    "due to the fact that we are dealing with non - interacting electrons , we can safely apply wick s theorem in order to evaluate the correlation functions .",
    "moreover , it is useful to exploit the particle - hole symmetry of the system in such a way to constraint the integrals only in the positive energy interval and to avoid problems related to double - counting .",
