    "teleportation belongs to fundamental science since bennett and coworkers proposed a protocol for quantum teleportation of a two - state particle @xcite .",
    "this means reconstructing the quantum state of a particle at a distant place , on a preexisting particle which state was previously undetermined .",
    "of course , any measurement of the quantum state to be teleported must be avoided whatsoever .",
    "bennett et al .",
    "proposed to take advantage of the non - locality of quantum mechanics @xcite , celebrated in the epr `` paradox '' @xcite . to this purpose , a pair of entangled particles is produced .",
    "this means that the state of each of them is undetermined , while it is fully determined once a measurement is made on the other .",
    "one member of the pair is given to the sender , alice , the other one ( the target ) to the receiver , bob .",
    "alice also receives a `` source '' particle in an unknown state , which she wants to teleport to bob .",
    "then she performs a joint measurement on this particle and her member of the entangled pair , so that as to measure them in an entangled state . as a result",
    ", the state of the target member of the pair , in the receiver ( bob ) s hands , is simultaneously determined .",
    "alice must send the result of her measurement as a classical signal .",
    "the state of the source particle can then be retrieved by bob , by applying to the target particle a unitary transformation .",
    "the state of the source particle has been destroyed during the process ( no - cloning theorem @xcite ) .",
    "an essential point is that , despite the simultaneity of alice s measurement and bob s particle state projection , teleportation is completed only when the classical information about the result of the joint measurement ( four possible bell states thus two classical bits ) has been received .",
    "therefore , as a mean of transmitting information , tp does not violate any fundamental law .",
    "the quantum information stored in the original state ( qubit ) has been split into a `` quantum '' channel ( the entangled pair ) and a classical channel .",
    "the first experimental verification of teleportation has been performed with photons @xcite , and was followed by several others @xcite .",
    "entangled photons with correlated orthogonal polarizations ( antisymmetrical state ) were produced by parametric - down conversion , and measurement of one of the four possible entangled states ( the singlet ) was achieved by polarized beam splitters .",
    "this simplification changes a little , though not fundamentally , the scenario of bennett _ et al .",
    "_ : the classical signal carries simply a `` yes '' or",
    "`` no '' answer concerning detection , and if the answer is yes , bob has readily in hands the original state , without needing any further transformation . as shown by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , this simplification does not affect the quantum correlations of the input and output particles ( defined as the fidelity of tp ) , but it reduces the efficiency of tp ( success has a probability @xmath0 ) .",
    "the tp protocol is thus rendered slower by a factor @xmath0 . in practice , unambiguous detection of teleportation",
    "requires coincidence measurements of photons at four detectors ( one for the detected particle , two for the bell measurement and one for a test for emission of the source particle ) , and it relies on the optimal control of individual photons achieved in modern quantum optics devices .",
    "it is in fact important to keep track of the emitted pair and the source particle , in order to control that bob indeed measures the twin of the photon which experiences the joint measurement by alice , and not a member of a previously or a subsequent emitted pair ( in which case no correlation would be expected ) .",
    "the proposal of bennett and coworkers and the subsequent experiments in quantum optics or atomic physics @xcite and nmr @xcite provide a beautiful illustration of the power of entanglement as a basic resource for quantum information @xcite .",
    "tp appears as a promising way to send unaltered quantum information , for instance by entangling fragile qubits with more robust ones , or with qubits that can be propagated over long distances ( photons for instance ) .",
    "the same principle allows to swap entanglement between successive particles , therefore entangling distant ones .",
    "other applications include distributing information among networks , or error - correcting codes @xcite .",
    "search for scalability naturally leads to a quest for similar processes in solid - state environments .",
    "the idea of electron / spin transport for quantum information processing schemes has also been developed in refs .",
    "here we shall focus on electron transfer between dots .",
    "in fact the strong advantages of photons ( weak interactions with the environment , allowing long - distance coherent propagation ) turn out to be also inconveniences : single or pair photon sources are weak , and it is difficult to operate gates on photon ensembles since they interact weakly , only through non - linear media . on the other hand , electrons can be produced one by one , using coulomb blockade in quantum dots , or in pairs @xcite .    since electrons are charged particles , it is in principle possible to operate with a variety of gates on them , taking advantage of their coulomb interactions in nanostructures .",
    "electronic systems also have obvious advantages toward integration .",
    "the main drawback of electronic proposals is that the underlying interactions can also lead to strong decoherence effects . yet , because high intensity single electron sources can be operated , the relevant time scales can be very short , and there is hope that quantum coherence of individual qubits can be controlled over distances ranging between microns and millimeters .    exploring entanglement in the solid state concerns the practical manipulation of qubits , but also the investigation of fundamental phenomena such as a proof of non - locality with massive or fermionic particles like electrons @xcite . an existing proposal for tp considers excitons in coupled quantum boxes , that can be manipulated optically @xcite .",
    "alternatively , an important issue arises when considering the electron spin degree of freedom , which is a candidate as a qubit for integrated quantum information devices @xcite . to produce electron pairs in an entangled spin state",
    ", one needs as a source a device where electron spins are correlated by their previous interactions or by their statistics , but the two particles can be dissociated while keeping this correlation . up to now",
    ", proposals have been made using i ) cooper pairs in superconductors @xcite or ii ) singlet states on a discrete level in quantum dots @xcite .",
    "entangled pairs can then be produced by the use of energy @xcite or spin filtering @xcite .",
    "starting from this elementary unit for entanglement , the construction of more complex devices relies on the analogy between photon propagation in waveguides and phase - coherent electron transport in nanostructures , which have been well illustrated by the fermion version of the hanbury - brown and twiss intensity correlations @xcite .",
    "however , further possibilities are opened by using coulomb interactions : transport of electrons , one electron at a time , can indeed be forced with the help of electrostatic barriers .",
    "electrons are trapped in quantum dots , separated by tunnel barriers and their transitions between dots and reservoirs are controlled by electrostatic gates @xcite . moreover , as shown in this work , correlations between transitions of different electrons at different barriers can indeed be used as a powerful tool to control and manipulate the spin qubits .",
    "then , although time - resolved control of individual electrons is still out of reach , teleportation can be achieved in a steady state operation through electrostatic couplings only @xcite . for a correct choice of the system parameters ,",
    "we show in the following that an elaborate sequence of transitions can be selected .",
    "for instance , in the teleportation process , a strict control is required on the time sequence : the joint measurement of the source particle ( 1 ) and of the particle ( 2 ) must occur only after the pair ( 2,3 ) is emitted , and the detection of the `` teleported '' particle ( 3 ) must wait for the joint measurement of particles ( 1,2 ) .",
    "as explained in detail in the present paper , electrostatic couplings between dots , together with individual gating , provide the necessary correlations to filter a unique transition sequence through the cell , without any temporal gate control whatsoever .    in the following , a detailed description of the operation of the teleportation cell is presented .",
    "an overall qualitative presentation is the subject of section ii .",
    "a full derivation of the microscopic and effective hamiltonians is given in section iii , and justifications are provided in appendix a. section iv contains the discussion of the electrostatics of the cell and the selection of the teleportation sequence .",
    "section v is devoted to the calculation of the steady state teleportation current using a bloch equation approach .",
    "section vi discusses the overall similarities and differences with the quantum optics implementation of teleportation .",
    "a summary of our results , also discussing possible extensions of our solid state teleportation proposal , is provided in the conclusion ( section vii ) .",
    "let us describe the set - up which allows teleportation of the electron spin .",
    "the tp cell is defined as comprising the dots @xmath1 ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) and the circuit @xmath2 ( fig . [ fig2]a ) .",
    "the basic resource , the entangled pair of electrons , is produced by superconducting dot @xmath3 according to the recent proposal @xcite : two normal quantum dots ( numbered @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) form neighboring tunnel junctions with a singlet superconducting electrode . electrostatic gates tune the dot chemical potentials such that the transition of a cooper pair from the superconductor to the couple of dots is resonant if and only if each partner of the pair is sent to a different dot : conversely , adding to or subtracting two electrons from a single dot is strongly suppressed by coulomb energy . due to the symmetry of the cooper pair wave function in the superconductor , the two electrons which are added in dots @xmath6 are in the antisymmetric singlet state , which is entangled . among",
    "the four bell states available with two spin @xmath7 particle , none of the three triplet combinations can be created .",
    "the double tunneling process involved in the creation of the entangled state is often denoted as a non - local ( or crossed ) andreev process @xcite .",
    "its amplitude depends on the tunneling amplitudes at both junctions ( assumed equal for simplicity ) , and on the distance @xmath8 between junctions @xcite .",
    "the latter dependence involves exponential decay of quasiparticles in the bulk ( clean ) superconductor ( on the coherence length @xmath9 ) and an algebraic factor @xmath10 .",
    "therefore a basic limitation of the `` andreev entangler '' is that the distance between the two junctions must not typically exceed a few nanometers .",
    "improvement of the algebraic factor is obtained by reducing the effective dimensionality of the superconductor @xcite or using a `` dirty '' superconductor @xcite .",
    "the source electron is created as an additional charge in dot 1 .",
    "the analyzer , which allows `` alice '' to perform the joint measurement , is chosen to be another superconductor .",
    "this possibility of using the same physical phenomenon both for production and detection of entangled pairs , is specific to solid state nano - electronics .",
    "this is in contrast with optics where parametric down conversion produce the pairs and polarized beam splitters detect antisymmetric pairs in an irreversible way . in the present case",
    ", having an irreversible transition of two electrons tunneling from dots @xmath11 and @xmath12 to superconductor @xmath13 ( alice ) provides a measurement of those electrons in a singlet state .",
    "note that if the electrons were to oscillate between dots @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( as a singlet ) and dot @xmath13 ( as a cooper pair ) there would be no measurement whatsoever .",
    "below , we shall see that the irreversibility is brough the presence of a reservoir which injects an electron in @xmath11 .",
    "this is analogous to the measurement performed by alice in the innsbruck optics experiment @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "the two photons which form the singlet state are destroyed by the measurement process .",
    "if needed , the production of a spin - polarized electron can be achieved by a spin - polarized reservoir @xmath14 , connected to dot @xmath11 by a tunnel junction .",
    "this polarized source could be made of a strongly polarized ferromagnet ( half - metal ) or based on any other injection scheme , using semiconductors for instance .",
    "symmetrically , detection of the teleported electron , sitting in dot @xmath15 , can be achieved by a spin - polarized reservoir @xmath16 , in the hands of `` bob '' ( figure 1 ) .",
    "it is convenient to connect the superconducting electrodes @xmath13 and @xmath17 by a superconducting circuit @xmath18 .",
    "indeed , once alice in @xmath13 detects a singlet pair , this pair can flow through the circuit @xmath18 towards @xmath3 , where , as we shall see , it triggers detection by bob .",
    "in addition , optimum operation of the device requires to correlate the charge transitions in the normal dots and superconducting electrodes . to this purpose ,",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath3 are chosen to be superconducting dots with sizeable coulomb charging energy .",
    "this enables to absorb / eject electron pairs one by one .",
    "before discussing the conditions on the parameters of this set - up , let us recall why the measurement on @xmath19 achieves teleportation @xcite .",
    "having an electron in dot @xmath11 in the state : @xmath20 in the singlet state @xmath21 .",
    "the latter is one of the four basis orthonormal bell states ( one singlet and three triplets ) @xmath22 one verifies that the resulting three - electron state can be rewritten as @xmath23 in the original scenario @xcite , alice is able to perform a measurement of any bell state on particles @xmath24 .",
    "this at the same time projects the state of particle @xmath15 onto a particular state , which bob can transform into the original state @xmath25 by applying an appropriate unitary transformation .",
    "the latter is known when alice sends by a classical two - bit channel the result of her measurement , which therefore completes teleportation . in particular , when the result is the singlet @xmath26 , the state in hands of bob is nothing but the original state of particle @xmath11 , up to a minus sign .",
    "bouwmester et al .",
    "@xcite simplified this protocol : measuring only the state @xmath26 still allows teleportation , provided alice sends as an information that she indeed completed the measurement .",
    "the set - up we propose for teleportation of electron spins is similar in its principle .",
    "once three additional electrons are in dots @xmath27 , the three possible triplet states for electrons in @xmath28 lead to no detection , while the singlet state can trigger ( with probability @xmath29 ) an andreev transition to the superconducting dot @xmath13 , which acts as alice s measurement apparatus .",
    "the remaining spin in dot @xmath15 ( target ) acquires the same state @xmath30 as the initial spin in dot @xmath31 , but teleportation is completed only when the electron is detected in reservoir @xmath16 ( bob ) .      the teleportation sequence ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) is the following : having an additional electron in dot @xmath11 , an entangled pair is created in dots @xmath32 .",
    "thus one electron occupies each of the normal dots .",
    "if the two electrons in @xmath33 are in the singlet state , they can tunnel in dot @xmath13 .",
    "this becomes a true measurement when another electron enters dot @xmath11 from lead @xmath14 , blocking the singlet pair in dot @xmath13 . at the same time",
    "the spin state of the electron previously in @xmath11 is transfered to @xmath15 , as shown by eq .",
    "[ bell_state_decomposition ] .",
    "let us show how this teleportation sequence is embedded in a teleportation cycle .",
    "indeed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , the pair absorbed in @xmath13 can flow from @xmath13 to @xmath3 and trigger the transfer and detection of the teleported electron in @xmath16 , thus allowing to recover the initial state in fig .",
    "it can then serve as source for another entangled pair , for the next teleportation cycle ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "it is essential to notice that irreversibility of the pair production ( from @xmath3 ) and of the measurement ( in @xmath13 ) is provided by the coupling to the reservoirs : coulomb repulsion between dots @xmath3 and @xmath15 makes the `` target '' electron in @xmath15 leave towards reservoir @xmath16 , which in turn lowers the energy of the pair in dot @xmath3 , allowing resonance with @xmath34 .",
    "similarly , the pair in @xmath35 ) oscillates back and forth to @xmath13 , but it becomes localized in @xmath13 when a new source electron enters dot @xmath11 .",
    "this in turn raises the energy in dot @xmath13 and allows resonance between @xmath13 and @xmath3 .",
    "the above set - up , together with _",
    "static _ gating of dots @xmath36 , allows efficient filtering of single - electron transitions ( from @xmath14 to @xmath11 and @xmath15 to @xmath16 ) and two - electron transitions ( from @xmath17 to @xmath37 and from @xmath33 to @xmath13 ) .",
    "but it should also prevent spurious transitions : it is indeed essential , to ensure fidelity of the teleportation process , that the target electron in @xmath15 does not escape ( is detected by bob ) before alice performs the measurement in @xmath13 .",
    "as shown in detail in section iv , this is obtained by appropriately choosing the gate potentials of each dots .",
    "the coulomb correlations induced by the electrostatics of this five - dot system can indeed exactly select the correct teleportation sequence .",
    "let us emphasize that transfer of a charge @xmath38 from dot @xmath13 to dot @xmath3 plays the role of the classical channel .",
    "even more , this classical signal strictly conditions the exit of the target electron . therefore , according to the laws of quantum mechanics , teleportation is achieved without ambiguity , with a fidelity conditioned by the few spurious processes like cotunneling .",
    "this is in contrast with the optics experiment where ( externally operated ) time correlations are used to select the tp events from spurious ones .",
    "the teleportation process manifests itself as a spin - conserving current passing from reservoir @xmath14 to reservoir @xmath16 .",
    "below we shall consider a situation where the cell ( excluding the leads ) is chosen to be symmetric , an assumption which allows to reduce the number of parameters .",
    "then , the direction of this current is fixed by applying a voltage bias @xmath39 between @xmath40 and @xmath41 . for each electron disappearing in @xmath14 and each electron appearing in @xmath16 with the same spin , exactly one cooper pair flows through the circuit @xmath42 . yet , in the present electronic device , a full proof of tp - irrespective of a quantum or classical description - requires an additional diagnosis , which we discuss at the end of the paper .",
    "the system under consideration ( tp cell and reservoirs ) is described by the hamiltonian : @xmath43 where @xmath44 contains the energy levels of the isolated elements ( dots and reservoirs ) , @xmath45 is the total coulomb charging energy and @xmath46 is a tunneling hamiltonian .",
    "the part @xmath44 reads    @xmath47    with one - electron energy levels @xmath48 in the normal dots ( in the hartree approximation ) ( @xmath49 ) @xmath50 normal dots @xmath51 must necessarily have a discrete spectrum , in order to avoid spin exchange processes which destroy entanglement .",
    "the `` empty '' state corresponds to a state with @xmath52 electrons in the dots , while the `` singly occupied '' state has an odd occupation number , which means the addition of one outer electron to the @xmath52 electrons within the dot @xcite .",
    "the last doubly occupied level of dots @xmath11 and @xmath15 must lie well below the electro - chemical potential of reservoirs @xmath14 and @xmath16 , so as to prohibit any spurious transition of `` wrong '' spin electrons between such levels and the reservoirs .",
    "this sets a lower bound on the level spacing @xcite .",
    "quasiparticle levels @xmath53 in the superconducting dots and reservoir @xmath2 ( @xmath54 ) enter the hamiltonian for the superconductors : @xmath55    while in normal reservoirs @xmath56    @xmath57    in the above , the operators @xmath58 and @xmath59 stand for electron annihilation and creation , and the @xmath60 s are the usual bogolubov quasiparticle operators @xcite ( @xmath61 ) , @xmath62 , with @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . here",
    "@xmath67 is the gap in superconductors @xmath68 , and @xmath18 where the chemical potential is set to zero with respect to the normal reservoirs @xmath69 .",
    "one assumes a free - electron spectrum in reservoirs @xmath70 with spin - dependent quasiparticle energies . to a good approximation , a continuous bcs - like quasiparticle spectrum in reservoir @xmath2 and dots @xmath71",
    "is specified : this requires that the superconducting dots are `` large '' enough .",
    "finally a discrete ( and spin - independent ) spectrum is chosen in dots @xmath72 .    the charging hamiltonian can be written in a compact form as a function of the occupation numbers @xmath73 of the dots ( @xmath74 ) @xcite    @xmath75    where the @xmath76 s are the effective occupation number imposed by the gate and bias voltages ( see section iv and appendix a ) .",
    "the couplings @xmath77 are the inverse capacitance matrix elements of the system .    here",
    "the coulomb charging energy of the superconducting dots is chosen to be smaller than their superconducting gap @xmath78 , so as to prohibit single electron transitions .",
    "let us assume that electronic transitions involve only one level of the normal dots .",
    "this is justified at low enough temperature by the discrete spectrum of n - dots , and by the fact that gate voltages can be chosen so as to select only two possible charge states .",
    "tunneling is supposed to occur only between : reservoir / normal dot junctions @xmath40 , @xmath79 , normal dot / superconducting dot junctions @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and superconducting reservoir / superconducting dot junctions @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "the one - electron tunneling hamiltonian can then be written as @xmath86 with @xmath87    notice that no direct tunneling occurs between normal dots , instead , dot @xmath12 is connected to both @xmath13 and @xmath3 dots .",
    "tunneling through the junctions is controlled by the rates @xmath88 , @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) and @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the spin - dependent density of states at the fermi level in reservoirs @xmath93 and @xmath94 the normal density of states in the superconducting reservoir .",
    "an important constraint concerns the coupling between normal dots and the reservoirs . in order to avoid spin exchange between dots @xmath95 and reservoirs , @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) must be smaller than the superconducting gap , the charging energy and the chemical potentials @xmath98 , @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the level spacings in each normal dot must be larger than @xmath98 , @xmath99 ( measured with respect to @xmath100 ) .",
    "the microscopic hamiltonian of the preceding section allows for several collective electron transfer processes",
    ". some of these will be more favorable because of the intermediate states which they involve ( generation of one or more quasiparticles in the superconducting elements ) .",
    "in particular , we will be interested in processes where a minimum of quasiparticles are excited in the superconducting elements of the teleportation cell .",
    "first consider processes involving two electrons , being transfered from / to normal quantum dots and a superconducting dot .",
    "these are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . crossed andreev reflection @xcite  also called pair tunneling  ( fig . [",
    "fig3]a ) involves the quasi - simultaneous tunneling of two electrons to / from a superconducting dot to two neighboring dots . as the first electron tunnels it generates a quasiparticle , which is then destroyed by the second electron which is transfered .",
    "cotunneling @xcite describes the transfer of an electron from one normal quantum dot to another ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) , via the superconductor ( the order of the sequence of the two tunneling events is arbitrary ) .",
    "the intermediate state also implies the creation of a quasiparticle , which is subsequently destroyed as in pair tunneling , and cotunneling is a spin preserving transition .",
    "next , there are three types of processes which involve @xmath101 single electron jumps .",
    "teleportation ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]c ) requires that dot @xmath11 is occupied initially , and dot @xmath15 is occupied in the final state .",
    "a cooper pair escapes from @xmath3 and another one is absorbed in @xmath13 . at no step in the process",
    "a directed matter transfer occurs between dot @xmath11 and dot @xmath15 .",
    "this is the opposite case for the succession of two cotunneling events ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]d ) , where , conversely , no cooper pair transfer occurs simultaneously , but an electron is transfered for @xmath11 to @xmath15 nevertheless .",
    "note that another possible cotunneling event from @xmath11 to @xmath15 can involve the bulk superconductor instead , by successive quasiparticle excitations in s - dot @xmath13 , @xmath102 , and s - dot @xmath3 .",
    "however , this process is negligible : it involves a geometrical factor corresponding to the propagation of unpaired electrons between @xmath13 and @xmath3 through the bulk superconductor .",
    "one may also consider the transfer of a cooper pair from @xmath3 to @xmath13 , this time without the transfer of an electron from @xmath11 to @xmath15 , which can be viewed as a kind of josephson coupling between @xmath3 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "note that both the successive cotunneling and the josephson - like processes compete with the andreev processes which are essential for teleportation .    here",
    ", we argue that optimum conditions for the operation of the teleportation cell are met when the andreev pair transitions ( from @xmath3 to ( @xmath103 ) and from ( @xmath28 ) to @xmath13 ) are chosen to be resonant .",

    "@xcite starting from a microscopic , single electron hopping hamiltonian .",
    "surprisingly , these josephson couplings can be reinforced by the coulomb blockade effects in the superconducting dots . in practice",
    ", such resonant conditions can be achieved because the individual levels of dots @xmath106 ( equal by our choice of a symmetric cell ) and dot @xmath107 can be independently chosen , provided they stay within the superconducting gaps of superconducting dots @xmath104 .    in appendix",
    "[ tmatrix ] , a perturbative argument is provided to show that direct transitions of electrons from @xmath11 to @xmath15 via @xmath12 can be strongly reduced compared to the teleportation process .",

    "then , contrarily to the teleportation process , cotunneling involves only non - resonant transitions and can be safely neglected to lowest order .",
    "we also show show in appendix [ tmatrix ] under which conditions the josephson process can be neglected .",
    "gate voltages on the five dots of the cell can be tuned such that all the singlet pair transitions in the tp cell are either resonant or blocked by coulomb interactions ( at @xmath108 and neglecting cotunneling ) .",

    "these last assumptions were also considered in @xcite , where the system formed by a superconductor and two normal dots was shown to behave as a source of entangled cooper pairs .",
    "non - local ( or crossed ) andreev process remains unchanged if the bulk superconductor is a small superconducting island with sizeable coulomb energy , especially in the resonant case .",
    "we further stress that here the driving force for teleportation is the voltage bias applied to the teleportation cell .",
    "the resulting cooper pair current flowing in the superconducting branch is not a josephson current , but is instead an andreev current dragged by the spin - polarized current flowing under the effect of the bias @xmath39 .",

    "this relies on the assumption  justified by perturbation theory estimates  that processes such as successive cotunneling via the two superconducting dots or such as josephson tunneling through the central dot , which may affect the fidelity of teleportation , can be neglected : the teleportation channel is then the dominant one .",
    "however , even if one measures average currents ( injection and detection current , together with the pair current ) and if one finds that these are correlated , this does not constitute a rigorous proof that we are dealing with teleportation .",

    ".    note that both the andreev and the cotunneling amplitudes of eqs .",
    "( [ andreev ] ) and ( [ cotunneling ] ) contain denominators @xmath302 which involve the superconducting gap .",
    "this , however does not imply that the amplitudes for such processes are proportional to @xmath303 , as one needs to take into account the energy dependence of @xmath304 and @xmath305 in order to compute the sums .",
    "in fact , these processes have either no dependence on the gap  the case of the andreev process  or a logarithmic dependence @xmath306 , where @xmath307 is the bandwidth of the superconductor in the normal state  for the case of cotunneling . discarding numerical factors of order unity",
    ", one finds : @xmath308 with @xmath309 the density of states of the superconductor in the normal state . for typical physical parameters ,",
    "the logarithm is of order one , so the andreev and the cotunneling process have a comparable magnitude .",
    "we consider three types of fourth - order tunneling processes which are relevant to our problem : a ) teleportation processes ; b ) the succession of two cotunneling processes which result in the spin conserving transfer of an electron from @xmath11 to @xmath15 ( an unwanted process which pollutes teleportation ) ; c ) josephson tunneling from @xmath13 to @xmath3 via dot @xmath171 .    for the teleportation process",
    "we start with the state ( @xmath146 ) as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . transferring one electron on @xmath12 or @xmath15 creates a quasiparticle in @xmath3 ( @xmath310 or @xmath311 ) , which is subsequently destroyed when the intermediate state with the electrons in the normal dots is reached ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "the final state ( @xmath148 ) can be reached via either of the two states ( @xmath312 or @xmath313 ) with one quasiparticle in @xmath13 each .",
    "the off - resonance ( or ) teleportation tunneling amplitude then reads :      note that by specifying that the dots level energies in @xmath11 , @xmath12 are located at an equal distance but opposite location with respect to the superconducting chemical potential , the resonance condition is enforced : @xmath315 ( also @xmath316 ) and this expression diverges ( except for the presence of @xmath317 ) .",
    "a more careful analysis would show that an re - summation of all the terms in the perturbation series leads to a finite amplitude in this resonant situation . as specified in the previous section ,",
    "the resonant regime is the working assumption of our teleportation proposal .    for the successive two cotunneling events , it is possible to write down a general expression for transitions from the state @xmath318 to the final state @xmath319 via the intermediate state @xmath320 :",
    "@xmath321 computing the sums over momentum , this is estimated to be : @xmath322      under the resonance condition , the energy denominator @xmath323 is `` large '' and successive cotunneling can be minimized . indeed , using eq .",
    "( [ energy_of_config ] ) and the definition of the capacitance matrix , one obtains : @xmath324 at this point we use our working assumption that all capacitances are equal , together with the resonance condition which fixes @xmath325 . furthermore we choose a value of @xmath189 which is located well into the stability regions of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . for a given initial configuration , such as @xmath326 , @xmath327 , @xmath328 , @xmath329 , as in the bottom right corner of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , one obtains that :      with a numerical prefactor of order unity .",
    "one can therefore favor processes involving two sequential andreev processes while at the same time reducing the effect of one - electron processes from @xmath11 to @xmath15 .",
    "granted , our finding that the intermediate state for the successive cotunneling process has a `` large '' charging energy @xmath256 is strictly speaking not sufficient to convince oneself that this process can be ruled out : the typical current associated with this process needs to be compared to the teleportation current of eq .",
    "( [ teleportation_current ] ) . to estimate this cotunneling current",
    ", we consider @xmath331 to be the effective hopping amplitude between 2 dots , dot @xmath11 and dot @xmath15 , both of which are connected to reservoirs @xmath14 and @xmath16 .",
    "a bloch equation approach was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe this situation .",
    "the corresponding current reads : @xmath332 note that the teleportation current and the cotunneling current become comparable when @xmath333 .",
    "the teleportation cell requires the _ opposite _ limit .",
    "indeed , the injection and evacuation from / to the reservoirs need to be efficient enough in order to avoid spurious processes .",
    "one is now in a position to justify why cotunneling can be neglected when compared to the teleportation current .",
    "assuming @xmath334 , @xmath335 and neglecting numerical factors , the two currents become : @xmath336 so one simply needs to compare @xmath229 and @xmath331 . using the estimate of eq .",
    "[ 2cot_amplitude ] ( assuming all single electron hoppings to be comparable ) , the condition for neglecting the cotunneling current becomes : @xmath337 that is , the crossed andreev reflection hopping is required to be much smaller than the energy difference between the initial and the intermediate state implied by the sequential cotunneling process .",
    "we have seen in the above that this energy difference is maximized when the capacitive energy @xmath256 is large , this is a confirmation of the crucial role played by the capacitive couplings in order to select the proper teleportation sequence .",
    "note that there are other higher order cotunneling processes , for instance those which involve intermediate states with two quasiparticles ( one in @xmath13 and one in @xmath3 at the same time ) .",
    "one argues here that they are much weaker because the corresponding energy denominators all contain the superconducting gap @xmath338 .",
    "a typical contribution would read ( this time neglecting the charging energies in front of the gap ) : @xmath339 the summations over momenta can be performed , for instance , provided that , for instance @xmath340 is replaced by @xmath341 or @xmath342 .",
    "this yields : @xmath343 one therefore sees that the latter contribution is smaller than that of eq .",
    "( [ 2cot_amplitude ] ) by a factor @xmath344 .",
    "recall that throughout this work , charging energies are assumed to be smaller than @xmath279 .",
    "finally , we evaluate some processes contributing to the josephson tunneling amplitudes ( pair tunneling from @xmath3 to @xmath13 via the central dot @xmath12 ) .",
    "the transport properties of a josephson junction containing an impurity level ( with charging energy ) in the tunnel barrier has been detailed in ref . @xcite .",
    "two situations are considered here .",
    "first , assume that dot @xmath12 is empty .",
    "the transitions involve an initial state @xmath345 and a final state @xmath346 .",
    "this transition necessarily involves ( at the beginning and at the end ) @xmath171 intermediate states @xmath347 and @xmath348 with one quasiparticle into @xmath13 or @xmath3 .",
    "the third intermediate state then has two possibilities : either it involves a quasiparticle in both @xmath13 and @xmath3 which gives a tunneling amplitude : @xmath349 or it implies double occupancy of the central dot : @xmath350 when one imposes a phase difference between @xmath13 and @xmath3 , the fact that the central dot is empty at the initial state makes this junction a `` 0 '' junction . on the other hand ,",
    "if dot @xmath12 is initially occupied , we look for transitions such as @xmath351 : @xmath352 on the other hand one can have the sequence @xmath353 with the amplitude : @xmath354 the latter two transitions lead to a @xmath355-junction behavior .",
    "note that all the josephson processes either involve three powers of the superconducting gap in their denominators , or they are proportional to @xmath356 times the inverse of the coulomb charging energy for double occupancy of normal dot @xmath12 .",
    "the choice of normal dots with a small total capacitance therefore allows to neglect these processes when compared to the ( resonant ) teleportation amplitude .",
